powerpc/book3s64/kuap/kuep: Move uamor setup to pkey init

This patch consolidates UAMOR update across pkey, kuap and kuep features.
The boot cpu initialize UAMOR via pkey init and both radix/hash do the
secondary cpu UAMOR init in early_init_mmu_secondary.

We don't check for mmu_feature in radix secondary init because UAMOR
is a supported SPRN with all CPUs supporting radix translation.
The old code was not updating UAMOR if we had smap disabled and smep enabled.
This change handles that case.
