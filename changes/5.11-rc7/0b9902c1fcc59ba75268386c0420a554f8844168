s390/qeth: fix deadlock during recovery

When qeth_dev_layer2_store() - holding the discipline_mutex - waits
inside qeth_l*_remove_device() for a qeth_do_reset() thread to complete,
we can hit a deadlock if qeth_do_reset() concurrently calls
qeth_set_online() and thus tries to aquire the discipline_mutex.

Move the discipline_mutex locking outside of qeth_set_online() and
qeth_set_offline(), and turn the discipline into a parameter so that
callers understand the dependency.

To fix the deadlock, we can now relax the locking:
As already established, qeth_l*_remove_device() waits for
qeth_do_reset() to complete. So qeth_do_reset() itself is under no risk
of having card->discipline ripped out while it's running, and thus
doesn't need to take the discipline_mutex.
