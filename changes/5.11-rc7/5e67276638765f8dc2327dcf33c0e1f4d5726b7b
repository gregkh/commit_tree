media: adv748x: Configure device when resuming from sleep

If the device is powered off (for example during system suspend to ram)
the devices loses its configuration, especially the slave i2c mappings
and other configuration set at probe time. This renders the device
unusable and the only way to recover is to unbind and rebind the device
to the driver to run the probe setup again.

Add an early resume callback that reinitializes the device and setup the
slave i2c address mappings and other probe time configuration.
