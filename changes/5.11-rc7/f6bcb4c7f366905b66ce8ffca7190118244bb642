regmap: debugfs: Fix a reversed if statement in regmap_debugfs_init()

This code will leak "map->debugfs_name" because the if statement is
reversed so it only frees NULL pointers instead of non-NULL.  In
fact the if statement is not required and should just be removed
because kfree() accepts NULL pointers.
