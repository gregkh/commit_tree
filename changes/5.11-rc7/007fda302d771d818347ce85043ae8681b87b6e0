ARM: dts: exynos: Enable DWC2 dual-role support on OdroidU3+ boards

MicroUSB port on OdroidU3+ boards can operate both as peripheral or as
host port. Till now it was configured as pheriperal only port, but it
turned out that the DWC2 driver code already handles everything needed to
support USB role-switch, so switch it to dual-role (OTG) mode. This has
no effect on OdroidU3 (without 'plus') and OdroidX2, which doesn't have
USB needed ID pin and VBUS wiring. Those will still operate correctly in
pheriperal mode only.
