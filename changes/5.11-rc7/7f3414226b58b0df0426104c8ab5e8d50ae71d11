um: time: fix initialization in time-travel mode

In time-travel mode, since my previous patch, the start time was
initialized too late, so that the system would read it before we
set it, thus always starting system time at 0 (1970-01-01). This
happens because timekeeping_init() reads the time and is called
before time_init().

Unfortunately, I didn't see this before because I was testing it
only with the RTC patch applied (and enabled), and then the time
is read again by the RTC a little - after time_init() this time.

Fix this by just doing the initialization whenever necessary.
