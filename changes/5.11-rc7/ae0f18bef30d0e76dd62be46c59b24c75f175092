spi: spi-sun6i: enable autosuspend feature

If SPI is used for periodic polling any sensor, significant delays
sometimes appear. Switching on module clocks during resume lead to delays.
Enabling autosuspend mode causes the controller to not suspend between
SPI transfers and the delays disappear.

The commit also remove unnecessary call to pm_runtime_idle() used
to explicit put device to suspended state. Without pm_runtime_idle() PM
core will put device in the suspended state just after probe() returns.
