mm: don't wake kswapd prematurely when watermark boosting is disabled

On 2-node NUMA hosts we see bursts of kswapd reclaim and subsequent
pressure spikes and stalls from cache refaults while there is plenty of
free memory in the system.

Usually, kswapd is woken up when all eligible nodes in an allocation are
full.  But the code related to watermark boosting can wake kswapd on one
full node while the other one is mostly empty.  This may be justified to
fight fragmentation, but is currently unconditionally done whether
watermark boosting is occurring or not.

In our case, many of our workloads' throughput scales with available
memory, and pure utilization is a more tangible concern than trends
around longer-term fragmentation.  As a result we generally disable
watermark boosting.

Wake kswapd only woken when watermark boosting is requested.
