drm/amd/pm: fix out-of-bound read on pptable->SkuReserved

A recent change added two uint16_t elements to PPTable_t and reduced the
uint32_t array down to 8 elements. This results in the dev_info printing
of pptable->SkuReserved[8] accessing a value that is out-of-range on
array SkuReserved.  The array has been shrunk by 1 element, so remove
this extraneous dev_info message.
