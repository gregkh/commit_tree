media: rkvdec: h264: Support profile and level controls

The Rockchip Video Decoder used in RK3399 supports H.264 profiles from
Baseline to High 4:2:2 up to Level 5.1, except for the Extended profile.

Expose the V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_H264_PROFILE and the
V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_H264_LEVEL control, so that userspace can query the
driver for the list of supported profiles and level.

For now, we don't expose 4:2:2 since the driver doesn't
implement the required support.

[Ezequiel: Don't expose 4:2:2 profile for now]
