drm/i915: Update gen12 multicast register ranges

The updated bspec forcewake table also provides us with new multicast
ranges that should be reflected in our workaround code.

Note that there are different types of multicast registers with
different styles of replication and different steering registers.  The
i915 MCR range lists we're updating here are only used to ensure we can
verify workarounds properly (i.e., if we can't steer register reads we
don't want to verify workarounds where an unsteered read might hit a
fused-off instance of the unit).  Because of this, we don't need to
include any of the multicast ranges where all instances of the register
will always present and fusing doesn't play a role.  Specifically, that
means that we are not including the MCR ranges designated as "SQIDI" in
the bspec.
