um: stdio_console: Make preferred console

The addition of the "ttynull" console driver did break the ordering of the
UML stdio console driver.
The UML stdio console driver is added in late_initcall (7), whereby the
ttynull driver is added in device_initcall (6), which always does make the
ttynull driver the default console.

Fix it by explicitly adding the UML stdio console as the preferred console,
in case no 'console=' command line option was specified.
