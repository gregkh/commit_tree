btrfs: update num_extent_pages to support subpage sized extent buffer

For subpage sized extent buffer, we have ensured no extent buffer will
cross page boundary, thus we would only need one page for any extent
buffer.

Update function num_extent_pages to handle such case.  Now
num_extent_pages() returns 1 for subpage sized extent buffer.
