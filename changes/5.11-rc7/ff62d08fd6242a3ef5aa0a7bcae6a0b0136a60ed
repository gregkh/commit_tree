usb: typec: tps6598x: Select USB_ROLE_SWITCH and REGMAP_I2C

This is more in line with what tcpm does and will be needed
to avoid recursive dependency like

 > drivers/power/supply/Kconfig:2:error: recursive dependency detected!
   drivers/power/supply/Kconfig:2: symbol POWER_SUPPLY is selected by TYPEC_TPS6598X
   drivers/usb/typec/Kconfig:64: symbol TYPEC_TPS6598X depends on REGMAP_I2C
   drivers/base/regmap/Kconfig:19: symbol REGMAP_I2C is selected by CHARGER_ADP5061
   drivers/power/supply/Kconfig:93: symbol CHARGER_ADP5061 depends on POWER_SUPPLY
   For a resolution refer to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.rst
   subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"

when selecting POWER_SUPPLY.
