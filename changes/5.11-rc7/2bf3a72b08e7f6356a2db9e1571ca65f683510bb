dt-bindings: regulator: qcom,rpmh-regulator: add pm8009 revision

PMIC pm8009 has special revision (P=1) made for sm8250 platform. The
major difference is the S2 regulator which supplies 0.95 V instead of
2.848V. Add special compatibility string for this chip revision.
The datasheet calls the chip just pm8009-1, so use the same name.
