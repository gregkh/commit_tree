Commit 9bb48c82aced ("tty: implement write_iter") converted the tty
layer to use write_iter. Fix the redirected_tty_write declaration
also in n_tty and change the comparisons to use write_iter instead of
write.

[ Also moved the declaration of redirected_tty_write() to the proper
  location in a header file. The reason for the bug was the bogus extern
  declaration in n_tty.c silently not matching the changed definition in
  tty_io.c, and because it wasn't in a shared header file, there was no
  cross-checking of the declaration.

  Sami noticed because Clang's Control Flow Integrity checking ended up
  incidentally noticing the inconsistent declaration.    - Linus ]
