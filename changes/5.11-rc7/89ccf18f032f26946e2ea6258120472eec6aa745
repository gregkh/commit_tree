printk: fix kmsg_dump_get_buffer length calulations

kmsg_dump_get_buffer() uses @syslog to determine if the syslog
prefix should be written to the buffer. However, when calculating
the maximum number of records that can fit into the buffer, it
always counts the bytes from the syslog prefix.

Use @syslog when calculating the maximum number of records that can
fit into the buffer.
