KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't attempt to recover machine checks for FWNMI enabled guests

Guests that can deal with machine checks would actually prefer the
hypervisor not to try recover for them. For example if SLB multi-hits
are recovered by the hypervisor by clearing the SLB then the guest
will not be able to log the contents and debug its programming error.

If guests don't register for FWNMI, they may not be so capable and so
the hypervisor will continue to recover for those.
