epoll: pull fatal signal checks into ep_send_events()

To simplify the code, pull in checking the fatal signals into
ep_send_events().  ep_send_events() is called only from ep_poll().

Note that, previously, we were always checking fatal events, but it is
checked only if eavail is true.  This should be fine because the goal of
that check is to quickly return from epoll_wait() when there is a pending
fatal signal.
