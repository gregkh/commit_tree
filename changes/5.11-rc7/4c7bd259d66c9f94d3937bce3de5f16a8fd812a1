scsi: bfa: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix multiple
warnings by explicitly adding a couple break statements and replacing /*
fall through */ comments with the new pseudo-keyword macro fallthrough;
instead of just letting the code fall through to the next case.

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* fall through */ comments as implicit
fall-through markings.
