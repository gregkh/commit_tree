platform/x86: intel-hid: Do not create SW_TABLET_MODE input-dev when a KIOX010A ACPI dev is present

Some 360 degree hinges (yoga) style 2-in-1 devices use 2 accelerometers
to allow the OS to determine the angle between the display and the base
of the device. On Windows these are read by a special HingeAngleService
process which calls an ACPI DSM (Device Specific Method) on the
ACPI KIOX010A device node for the sensor in the display, to let the
firmware know if the 2-in-1 is in tablet- or laptop-mode so that it can
disable the kbd and touchpad to avoid spurious input in tablet-mode.

The linux kxcjk1013 driver calls the DSM for this once at probe time
to ensure that the builtin kbd and touchpad work. On some devices this
causes a "spurious" 0xcd event on the intel-hid ACPI dev. In this case
there is not a functional tablet-mode switch, so we should not register
the tablet-mode switch device.
