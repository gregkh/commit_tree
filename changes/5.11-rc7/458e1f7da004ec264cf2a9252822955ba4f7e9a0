um: irq: Clean up and rename struct irq_fd

This really shouldn't be called "irq_fd" since it doesn't
carry an fd. Well, it used to, apparently, but that struct
member is unused.

Rename it to "irq_reg" since it more accurately reflects a
registered interrupt, and remove the unused 'next' and 'fd'
members from the struct as well.

While at it, also move it to the implementation, it's not
used anywhere else, and the header file is shared with the
userspace components.
