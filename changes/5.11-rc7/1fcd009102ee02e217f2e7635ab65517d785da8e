x86/mm/ident_map: Check for errors from ident_pud_init()

Commit

  ea3b5e60ce80 ("x86/mm/ident_map: Add 5-level paging support")

added ident_p4d_init() to support 5-level paging, but this function
doesn't check and return errors from ident_pud_init().

For example, the decompressor stub uses this code to create an identity
mapping. If it runs out of pages while trying to allocate a PMD
pagetable, the error will be currently ignored.

Fix this to propagate errors.
