arm64: dts: rockchip: Use only supported PCIe link speed on Pinebook Pro

On Pinebook Pro laptops with an NVMe SSD installed, prevent random
crashes in the NVMe driver by not attempting to use a PCIe link speed
higher than that supported by the RK3399 SoC.

See commit 712fa1777207 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: add max-link-speed for
rk3399").
