usb: typec: tcpm: Disregard vbus off while in PR_SWAP_SNK_SRC_SOURCE_ON

During PR_SWAP sequence, when TCPM is waiting in PR_SWAP_SNK_SRC_SOURCE_ON
for the vbus source to ramp up, TCPM would prematurely exit
PR_SWAP_SNK_SRC_SOURCE_ON and transition to SNK_UNATTACHED state when a
vbus off notification is received. This should not be the case as vbus
can still be off while in PR_SWAP_SNK_SRC_SOURCE_ON and the vbus source
has PD_T_NEWSRC to ramp up.
