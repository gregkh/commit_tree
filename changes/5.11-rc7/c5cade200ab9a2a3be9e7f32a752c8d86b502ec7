futex: Provide and use pi_state_update_owner()

Updating pi_state::owner is done at several places with the same
code. Provide a function for it and use that at the obvious places.

This is also a preparation for a bug fix to avoid yet another copy of the
same code or alternatively introducing a completely unpenetratable mess of
gotos.
