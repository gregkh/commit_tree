scripts: get_feat.pl: add a script to handle Documentation/features

The Documentation/features contains a set of parseable files.
It is not worth converting them to ReST format, as they're
useful the way it is. It is, however, interesting to parse
them and produce output on different formats:

1) Output the contents of a feature in ReST format;

2) Output what features a given architecture supports;

3) Output a matrix with features x architectures.
