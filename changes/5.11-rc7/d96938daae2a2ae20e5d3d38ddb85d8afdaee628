lkdtm: tests for FORTIFY_SOURCE

Add code to test both:

 - runtime detection of the overrun of a structure. This covers the
   __builtin_object_size(x, 0) case. This test is called FORTIFY_OBJECT.

 - runtime detection of the overrun of a char array within a structure.
   This covers the __builtin_object_size(x, 1) case which can be used
   for some string functions. This test is called FORTIFY_SUBOBJECT.
