x86/apic/uv: Fix inconsistent destination mode

The UV x2apic is strictly using physical destination mode, but
apic::dest_logical is initialized with APIC_DEST_LOGICAL.

This does not matter much because UV does not use any of the generic
functions which use apic::dest_logical, but is still inconsistent.
