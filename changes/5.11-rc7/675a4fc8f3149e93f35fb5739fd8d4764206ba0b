btrfs: tests: initialize test inodes location

I noticed that sometimes the module failed to load because the self
tests failed like this:

  BTRFS: selftest: fs/btrfs/tests/inode-tests.c:963 miscount, wanted 1, got 0

This turned out to be because sometimes the btrfs ino would be the btree
inode number, and thus we'd skip calling the set extent delalloc bit
helper, and thus not adjust ->outstanding_extents.

Fix this by making sure we initialize test inodes with a valid inode
number so that we don't get random failures during self tests.
