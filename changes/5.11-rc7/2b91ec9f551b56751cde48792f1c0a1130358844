s390/vtime: Use the generic IRQ entry accounting

s390 has its own version of IRQ entry accounting because it doesn't
account the idle time the same way the other architectures do. Only
the actual idle sleep time is accounted as idle time, the rest of the
idle task execution is accounted as system time.

Make the generic IRQ entry accounting aware of architectures that have
their own way of accounting idle time and convert s390 to use it.

This prepares s390 to get involved in further consolidations of IRQ
time accounting.
