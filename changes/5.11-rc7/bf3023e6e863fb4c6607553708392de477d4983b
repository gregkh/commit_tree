mmc: sdhci-st: drop of_match_ptr from of_device_id table

The driver can match only via the DT table so the table should be always
used and the of_match_ptr does not have any sense (this also allows ACPI
matching via PRP0001, even though it is not relevant here).  This fixes
compile warning (!CONFIG_OF on x86_64):

    drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-st.c:512:34: warning:
        ‘st_sdhci_match’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
