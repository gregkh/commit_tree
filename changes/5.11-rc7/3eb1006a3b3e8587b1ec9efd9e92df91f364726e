net/mlx5: DR, Sync chunks only during free

When freeing chunks, we want to sync the steering
so that all the "hot" memory will be written to ICM
and all the chunks that are in the hot_list will be
actually destroyed.
When allocating from the pool, we don't have a need
to sync the steering, as we're not freeing anything,
and sync might just hurt the performance in terms of
flow-per-second offloaded.
