btrfs: move pos increment and pagecache extension to btrfs_buffered_write

While we do this, correct the call to pagecache_isize_extended:

 - pagecache_isize_extended needs to be called to the start of the write
   as opposed to i_size

 - we don't need to check range before the call, this is done in the
   function
