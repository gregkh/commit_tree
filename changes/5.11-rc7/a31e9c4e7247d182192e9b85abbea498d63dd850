Revert "um: support some of ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY"

This reverts commit 963285b0b47a ("um: support some of
ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY"), as it turns out that it's not only not
working (due to um never using the protection bits in the
page tables) but also corrupts the page tables if used on a
non-vmalloc page, since um never allocates proper page tables
for the 'physmem' in the first place.

Fixing all this will take more effort, so for now revert it.
