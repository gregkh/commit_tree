drm/i915: Skip vswing programming for TBT

In thunderbolt mode the PHY is owned by the thunderbolt controller.
We are not supposed to touch it. So skip the vswing programming
as well (we already skipped the other steps not applicable to TBT).

Touching this stuff could supposedly interfere with the PHY
programming done by the thunderbolt controller.
