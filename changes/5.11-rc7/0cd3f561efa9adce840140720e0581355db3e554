platform/x86: ISST: Mark mmio_range_devid_0 and mmio_range_devid_1 with static keyword

Fix the following sparse warnings:

drivers/platform/x86/intel_speed_select_if/isst_if_mmio.c:23:24: warning: symbol 'mmio_range_devid_0' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/platform/x86/intel_speed_select_if/isst_if_mmio.c:28:24: warning: symbol 'mmio_range_devid_1' was not declared. Should it be static?
