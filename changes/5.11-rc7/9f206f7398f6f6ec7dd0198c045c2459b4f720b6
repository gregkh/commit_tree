RDMA/vmw_pvrdma: Fix network_hdr_type reported in WC

The PVRDMA device HW interface defines network_hdr_type according to an
old definition of the internal kernel rdma_network_type enum that has
since changed, resulting in the wrong rdma_network_type being reported.

Fix this by explicitly defining the enum used by the PVRDMA device and
adding a function to convert the pvrdma_network_type to rdma_network_type
enum.
