soc: sunxi: mbus: Remove DE2 display engine compatibles

The DE2 display engine hardware takes physical addresses that do not
need PHYS_BASE subtracted. As a result, they should not be present
on the mbus driver match list. Remove them.

This was tested on the A83T, along with the patch allowing the DMA
range map to be non-NULL and restores a working display.
