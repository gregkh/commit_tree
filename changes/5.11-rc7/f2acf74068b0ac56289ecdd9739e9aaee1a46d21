drm/i915: Reduce GPU error capture mutex hold time

Shrink the hold time for the error capture mutex to just around the
acquire/release of the PTE used for reading back the object via the
Global GTT. For platforms that do not need the GGTT read back, we can
skip the mutex entirely and allow concurrent error capture. Where we do
use the GGTT, by restricting the hold time around the slow readback and
compression, we are more resilient against softlockups (khungtaskd) as
the heartbeat may well also trigger an error while the first is on
going, and this allows the heartbeat reset to skip past the capture and
not be stalled.
