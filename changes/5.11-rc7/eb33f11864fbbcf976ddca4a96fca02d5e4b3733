net: mvneta: move skb_shared_info in mvneta_xdp_put_buff caller

Pass skb_shared_info pointer from mvneta_xdp_put_buff caller. This is a
preliminary patch to reduce accesses to skb_shared_info area and reduce
cache misses.
Remove napi parameter in mvneta_xdp_put_buff signature since it is always
run in NAPI context
