x86/xen: Add xen_no_vector_callback option to test PCI INTX delivery

It's useful to be able to test non-vector event channel delivery, to make
sure Linux will work properly on older Xen which doesn't have it.

It's also useful for those working on Xen and Xen-compatible hypervisors,
because there are guest kernels still in active use which use PCI INTX
even when vector delivery is available.
