serial: imx: Remove unneeded of_device_get_match_data() NULL check

Since 5.10-rc1 i.MX is a devicetree-only platform and the NULL check on
of_device_get_match_data() is no longer needed.

This check was only needed when this driver supported both DT and non-DT
platforms.

Remove the unneeded of_device_get_match_data() NULL check.
