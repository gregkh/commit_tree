tools/power/turbostat: Fallback to an MSR read for EPB

Commit

  6d6501d912a9 ("tools/power/turbostat: Read energy_perf_bias from sysfs")

converted turbostat to read the energy_perf_bias value from sysfs.
However, older kernels which do not have that file yet, would fail. For
those, fall back to the MSR reading.
