KVM: x86/mmu: Use raw level to index into MMIO walks' sptes array

Bump the size of the sptes array by one and use the raw level of the
SPTE to index into the sptes array.  Using the SPTE level directly
improves readability by eliminating the need to reason out why the level
is being adjusted when indexing the array.  The array is on the stack
and is not explicitly initialized; bumping its size is nothing more than
a superficial adjustment to the stack frame.
