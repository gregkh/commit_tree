Input: st1232 - do not read more bytes than needed

st1232_ts_read_data() already reads ts->read_buf_len bytes (8 or 20
bytes) from the touchscreen controller.  This was fine when it was used
to read touch point coordinates only, but is overkill for reading the
touchscreen resolution, which just needs 3 bytes.

Optimize transfers by passing the wanted number of bytes.
