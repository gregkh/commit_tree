spi: fix the divide by 0 error when calculating xfer waiting time

The xfer waiting time is the result of xfer->len / xfer->speed_hz. This
patch makes the assumption of 100khz xfer speed if the xfer->speed_hz is
not assigned and stays 0. This avoids the divide by 0 issue and ensures
a reasonable tolerant waiting time.
