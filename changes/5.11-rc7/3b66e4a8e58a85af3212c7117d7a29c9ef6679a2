regulator: bd718x7: Add enable times

Use the typical startup times from the data sheet so boards get a
reasonable default. Not setting any enable time can lead to board hangs
when e.g. clocks are enabled too soon afterwards.

This fixes gpu power domain resume on the Librem 5.

[Moved #defines into driver, seems to be general agreement and avoids any
cross tree issues -- broonie]
