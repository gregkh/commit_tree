watchdog: sprd: remove watchdog disable from resume fail path

sprd_wdt_start() would return fail if the loading operation is not completed
in a certain time, disabling watchdog for that case would probably cause
the kernel crash when kick watchdog later, that's too bad, so remove the
watchdog disable operation for the fail case to make sure other parts in
the kernel can run normally.
