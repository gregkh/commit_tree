tools/resolve_btfids: Warn when having multiple IDs for single type

The kernel image can contain multiple types (structs/unions)
with the same name. This causes distinct type hierarchies in
BTF data and makes resolve_btfids fail with error like:

  BTFIDS  vmlinux
FAILED unresolved symbol udp6_sock

as reported by Qais Yousef [1].

This change adds warning when multiple types of the same name
are detected:

  BTFIDS  vmlinux
WARN: multiple IDs found for 'file': 526, 113351 - using 526
WARN: multiple IDs found for 'sk_buff': 2744, 113958 - using 2744

We keep the lower ID for the given type instance and let the
build continue.

Also changing the 'nr' variable name to 'nr_types' to avoid confusion.
