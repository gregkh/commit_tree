arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180-trogdor: Make pp3300_a the default supply for pp3300_hub

The trogdor design has two options for supplying the 'pp3300_hub' power
rail, it can be supplied by 'pp3300_l7c' or 'pp3300_a'. The 'pp3300_a'
path includes a load switch that can be controlled through GPIO84.
Initially trogdor boards used 'pp3300_l7c' to power the USB hub, newer
revisions (will) use 'pp3300_a' as supply for 'pp3300_hub'.

Add a DT node for the 'pp3300_a' path and a pinctrl entry for the GPIO.
Make this path the default and keep trogdor rev1, lazor rev0 and rev1
on 'pp3300_l7c'. These earlier revisions also allocated the GPIO to the
purpose of controlling the power switch, so there is no need to limit
the pinctrl config to newer revisions. Remove the platform-wide
'always/boot-on' properties from 'pp3300_l7c' and add them to the
boards that use this supply. Also delete the 'always/boot-on'
properties of 'pp3300_hub' for these boards.
