ACPI: sysfs: Prefer "compatible" modalias

Commit 8765c5ba1949 ("ACPI / scan: Rework modalias creation when
"compatible" is present") may create two "MODALIAS=" in one uevent
file if specific conditions are met.

This breaks systemd-udevd, which assumes each "key" in one uevent file
to be unique. The internal implementation of systemd-udevd overwrites
the first MODALIAS with the second one, so its kmod rule doesn't load
the driver for the first MODALIAS.

So if both the ACPI modalias and the OF modalias are present, use the
latter to ensure that there will be only one MODALIAS.
