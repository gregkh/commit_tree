dt-bindings: remoteproc: qcom: Deprecate regulators for Q6V5 PDs

Newer platforms vote for necessary power domains through the power
domain subsystem. For historical reasons older platforms like MSM8916
or MSM8974 still control these as regulators.

Managing them as power domains is preferred since that allows us
to vote for corners instead of raw voltages. Document that those
should be specified as power domains and deprecate using them
through the regulator interface.
