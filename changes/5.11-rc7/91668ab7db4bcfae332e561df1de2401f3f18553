powerpc/perf: MMCR0 control for PMU registers under PMCC=00

PowerISA v3.1 introduces new control bit (PMCCEXT) for restricting
access to group B PMU registers in problem state when
MMCR0 PMCC=0b00. In problem state and when MMCR0 PMCC=0b00,
setting the Monitor Mode Control Register bit 54 (MMCR0 PMCCEXT),
will restrict read permission on Group B Performance Monitor
Registers (SIER, SIAR, SDAR and MMCR1). When this bit is set to zero,
group B registers will be readable. In other platforms (like power9),
the older behaviour is retained where group B PMU SPRs are readable.

Patch adds support for MMCR0 PMCCEXT bit in power10 by enabling
this bit during boot and during the PMU event enable/disable callback
functions.
