i3c/master: Fix uninitialized variable next_addr

The variable next_addr is not initialized and is being used in a call
to i3c_master_get_free_addr as a starting point to find the next address.
Fix this by initializing next_addr to 0 to avoid an uninitialized garbage
starting address from being used.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
