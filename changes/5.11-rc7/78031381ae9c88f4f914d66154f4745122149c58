bpf: Drop disabled LSM hooks from the sleepable set

Some networking and keys LSM hooks are conditionally enabled
and when building the new sleepable BPF LSM hooks with those
LSM hooks disabled, the following build error occurs:

  BTFIDS  vmlinux
  FAILED unresolved symbol bpf_lsm_socket_socketpair

To fix the error, conditionally add the relevant networking/keys
LSM hooks to the sleepable set.
