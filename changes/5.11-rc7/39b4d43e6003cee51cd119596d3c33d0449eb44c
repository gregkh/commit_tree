KVM: x86/mmu: Get root level from walkers when retrieving MMIO SPTE

Get the so called "root" level from the low level shadow page table
walkers instead of manually attempting to calculate it higher up the
stack, e.g. in get_mmio_spte().  When KVM is using PAE shadow paging,
the starting level of the walk, from the callers perspective, is not
the CR3 root but rather the PDPTR "root".  Checking for reserved bits
from the CR3 root causes get_mmio_spte() to consume uninitialized stack
data due to indexing into sptes[] for a level that was not filled by
get_walk().  This can result in false positives and/or negatives
depending on what garbage happens to be on the stack.

Opportunistically nuke a few extra newlines.
