dt-bindings: memory: tegra30: emc: Document OPP table and voltage regulator

Document new OPP table and voltage regulator properties which are needed
for supporting dynamic voltage-frequency scaling of the memory controller.
Some boards may have a fixed core voltage regulator, hence it's optional
because frequency scaling still may be desired.
