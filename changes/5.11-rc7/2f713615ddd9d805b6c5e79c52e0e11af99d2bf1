libceph: move msgr1 protocol implementation to its own file

A pure move, no other changes.

Note that ceph_tcp_recv{msg,page}() and ceph_tcp_send{msg,page}()
helpers are also moved.  msgr2 will bring its own, more efficient,
variants based on iov_iter.  Switching msgr1 to them was considered
but decided against to avoid subtle regressions.
