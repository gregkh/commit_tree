mpls: drop skb's dst in mpls_forward()

Commit 394de110a733 ("net: Added pointer check for
dst->ops->neigh_lookup in dst_neigh_lookup_skb") added a test in
dst_neigh_lookup_skb() to avoid a NULL pointer dereference. The root
cause was the MPLS forwarding code, which doesn't call skb_dst_drop()
on incoming packets. That is, if the packet is received from a
collect_md device, it has a metadata_dst attached to it that doesn't
implement any dst_ops function.

To align the MPLS behaviour with IPv4 and IPv6, let's drop the dst in
mpls_forward(). This way, dst_neigh_lookup_skb() doesn't need to test
->neigh_lookup any more. Let's keep a WARN condition though, to
document the precondition and to ease detection of such problems in the
future.
