powerpc/32s: Split and inline flush_tlb_mm() and flush_tlb_page()

flush_tlb_mm() and flush_tlb_page() handle both the MMU_FTR_HPTE_TABLE
case and the other case.

The non MMU_FTR_HPTE_TABLE case is trivial as it is only a call
to _tlbie()/_tlbia() which is not worth a dedicated function.

Make flush_tlb_mm() and flush_tlb_page() hash specific and call
them from tlbflush.h based on mmu_has_feature(MMU_FTR_HPTE_TABLE).
