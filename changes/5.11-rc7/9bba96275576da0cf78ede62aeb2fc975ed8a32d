platform/x86: i2c-multi-instantiate: Don't create platform device for INT3515 ACPI nodes

There are several reports about the tps6598x causing
interrupt flood on boards with the INT3515 ACPI node, which
then causes instability. There appears to be several
problems with the interrupt. One problem is that the
I2CSerialBus resources do not always map to the Interrupt
resource with the same index, but that is not the only
problem. We have not been able to come up with a solution
for all the issues, and because of that disabling the device
for now.

The PD controller on these platforms is autonomous, and the
purpose for the driver is primarily to supply status to the
userspace, so this will not affect any functionality.
