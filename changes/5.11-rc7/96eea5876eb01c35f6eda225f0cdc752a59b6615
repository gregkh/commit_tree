usb: xhci: Remove in_interrupt() checks

The usage of in_interrupt() in drivers is phased out for various reasons.

xhci_set_hc_event_deq() has an !in_interrupt() check which is pointless
because the function is only invoked from xhci_mem_init() which is clearly
task context as it does GFP_KERNEL allocations. Remove it.

xhci_urb_enqueue() prints a debug message if an URB is submitted after the
underlying hardware was suspended. But that warning is only issued when
in_interrupt() is true, which makes no sense. Simply return -ESHUTDOWN and
be done with it.
