Documentation: scheduler: fix information on arch SD flags, sched_domain and sched_debug

This document seems to be out of date for many, many years. Even it has
misspelled from the first day.
ARCH_HASH_SCHED_TUNE should be ARCH_HAS_SCHED_TUNE
ARCH_HASH_SCHED_DOMAIN should be ARCH_HAS_SCHED_DOMAIN

Since v2.6.14, kernel completely deleted the relevant code and even
arch_init_sched_domains() was deleted.

Right now, kernel is asking architectures to call set_sched_topology() to
override the default sched domains.

On the other hand, to print the schedule debug information, users need to
set sched_debug cmdline or enable it by sysfs entry. So this patch also
adds the description for sched_debug.
