iwlwifi: mvm: fix the return type for DSM functions 1 and 2

The return type value of functions 1 and 2 were considered to be an
integer inside a buffer, but they can also be only an integer, without
the buffer.  Fix the code in iwl_acpi_get_dsm_u8() to handle it as a
single integer value, as well as packed inside a buffer.
