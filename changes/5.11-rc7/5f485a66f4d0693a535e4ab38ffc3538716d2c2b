powerpc/rtas: add rtas_activate_firmware()

Provide a documented wrapper function for the ibm,activate-firmware
service, which must be called after a partition migration or
hibernation.

If the function is absent or the call fails, the OS will continue to
run normally with the current firmware, so there is no need to perform
any recovery. Just log it and continue.
