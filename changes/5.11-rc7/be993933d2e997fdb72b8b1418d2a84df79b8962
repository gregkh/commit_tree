ext4: remove unnecessary wbc parameter from ext4_bio_write_page

ext4_bio_write_page does not need wbc parameter, since its parameter
io contains the io_wbc field. The io::io_wbc is initialized by
ext4_io_submit_init which is called in ext4_writepages and
ext4_writepage functions prior to ext4_bio_write_page.
Therefor, when ext4_bio_write_page is called, wbc info
has already been included in io parameter.
