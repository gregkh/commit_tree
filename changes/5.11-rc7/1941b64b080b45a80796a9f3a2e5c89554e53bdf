btrfs: rename bio_offset of extent_submit_bio_start_t to dio_file_offset

The parameter bio_offset of extent_submit_bio_start_t is very confusing.
If it's really bio_offset (offset to bio), then it should be u32.  But
in fact, it's only utilized by dio read, and that member is used as file
offset, which must be u64.

Rename it to dio_file_offset since the only user uses it as file offset,
and add comment for who is using it.
