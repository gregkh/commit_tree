netfilter: nftables: fix incorrect increment of loop counter

The intention of the err_expr cleanup path is to iterate over the
allocated expr_array objects and free them, starting from i - 1 and
working down to the start of the array. Currently the loop counter
is being incremented instead of decremented and also the index i is
being used instead of k, repeatedly destroying the same expr_array
element.  Fix this by decrementing k and using k as the index into
expr_array.
