softirq: Avoid bad tracing / lockdep interaction

Similar to commit:

  1a63dcd8765b ("softirq: Reorder trace_softirqs_on to prevent lockdep splat")

__local_bh_enable_ip() can also call into tracing with inconsistent
state. Unlike that commit we don't need to bother about the tracepoint
because 'cnt-1' never matches preempt_count() (by construction).
