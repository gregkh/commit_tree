arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Reserve LPASS clocks in gcc

The GCC_LPASS_Q6_AXI_CLK and GCC_LPASS_SWAY_CLK clocks may not be
touched on a typical UEFI based SDM845 device, but when the kernel is
built with CONFIG_SDM_LPASSCC_845 this happens, unless they are marked
as protected-clocks in the DT.

This was done for the MTP and the Pocophone, but not for DB845c and the
Lenovo Yoga C630 - causing these to fail to boot if the LPASS clock
controller is enabled (which it typically isn't).
