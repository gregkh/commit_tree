Revert "driver core: fw_devlink: Add support for batching fwnode parsing"

This reverts commit 716a7a25969003d82ab738179c3f1068a120ed11.

The fw_devlink_pause/resume() APIs added by the commit being reverted
were a first cut attempt at optimizing boot time. But these APIs don't
fully solve the problem and are very fragile (can only be used for the
top level devices being added). This series replaces them with a much
better optimization that works for all device additions and also has the
benefit of reducing the complexity of the firmware (DT, EFI) specific
code and abstracting out common code to driver core.
