platform/x86: acer-wmi: Drop no-op set_quirks call from find_quirks

set_quirks has a "if (!interface) return;" check at its beginning and
interface always is NULL when set_quirks is called from find_quirks,
so it is a no-op and we can drop it.

This also allows dropping the "if (!interface) return;" from set_quirks
since set_quirks now always is called with interface != NULL.
