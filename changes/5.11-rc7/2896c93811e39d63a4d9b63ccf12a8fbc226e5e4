scsi: target: Fix XCOPY NAA identifier lookup

When attempting to match EXTENDED COPY CSCD descriptors with corresponding
se_devices, target_xcopy_locate_se_dev_e4() currently iterates over LIO's
global devices list which includes all configured backstores.

This change ensures that only initiator-accessible backstores are
considered during CSCD descriptor lookup, according to the session's
se_node_acl LUN list.

To avoid LUN removal race conditions, device pinning is changed from being
configfs based to instead using the se_node_acl lun_ref.
