Input: st1232 - fix off-by-one error in resolution handling

Before, the maximum coordinates were fixed to (799, 479) or (319, 479),
depending on touchscreen controller type.  The driver was changed to
read the actual values from the touchscreen controller, but did not take
into account the returned values are not the maximum coordinates, but
the touchscreen resolution (e.g. 800 and 480).

Fix this by subtracting 1.
