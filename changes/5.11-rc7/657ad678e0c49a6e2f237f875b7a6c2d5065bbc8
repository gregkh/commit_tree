crypto: qat - allow for instances in different banks

Allow for crypto instances to be configured with symmetric crypto rings
that belong to a bank that is different from the one where asymmetric
crypto rings are located.

This is to allow for devices with banks made of a single ring pair.
In these, crypto instances will be composed of two separate banks.

Changed string literals are not exposed to the user space.
