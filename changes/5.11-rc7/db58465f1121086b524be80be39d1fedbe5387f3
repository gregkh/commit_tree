cachefiles: Drop superfluous readpages aops NULL check

After the recent actions to convert readpages aops to readahead, the
NULL checks of readpages aops in cachefiles_read_or_alloc_page() may
hit falsely.  More badly, it's an ASSERT() call, and this panics.

Drop the superfluous NULL checks for fixing this regression.

[DH: Note that cachefiles never actually used readpages, so this check was
 never actually necessary]
