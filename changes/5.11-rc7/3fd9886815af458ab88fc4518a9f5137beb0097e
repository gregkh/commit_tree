drm/nouveau/kms/nv50-: Use state helper instead of crtc pointer

dispnv50 references the crtc->state pointer in order to get the current
CRTC state in its atomic_check hook, which would be the old CRTC state in
the global atomic state.

Use the drm_atomic_get_old_crtc_state helper to get that state to make it
more obvious.
