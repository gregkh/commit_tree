sched: Prepare to use balance_push in ttwu()

In preparation of using the balance_push state in ttwu() we need it to
provide a reliable and consistent state.

The immediate problem is that rq->balance_callback gets cleared every
schedule() and then re-set in the balance_push_callback() itself. This
is not a reliable signal, so add a variable that stays set during the
entire time.

Also move setting it before the synchronize_rcu() in
sched_cpu_deactivate(), such that we get guaranteed visibility to
ttwu(), which is a preempt-disable region.
