thunderbolt: Keep the parent runtime resumed for a while on device disconnect

When doing device firmware upgrade the device will disconnect for a
while and then reconnect back. Keep the parent device (and the whole
domain) powered for a while so we don't need to runtime resume
immediately when the device is connected back after the device upgrade
completes.
