net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: prepare xmit/rx path for multi-port devices in mac-only mode

This patch adds multi-port support to TI AM65x CPSW driver xmit/rx path in
preparation for adding support for multi-port devices, like Main CPSW0 on
K3 J721E SoC or future CPSW3g on K3 AM64x SoC.
Hence DMA channels are common/shared for all ext Ports and the RX/TX NAPI
and DMA processing going to be assigned to first available netdev this patch:
 - ensures all RX descriptors fields are initialized;
 - adds synchronization for TX DMA push/pop operation (locking) as
Networking core locks are not enough any more;
 - updates TX bql processing for every packet in
am65_cpsw_nuss_tx_compl_packets() as every completed TX skb can have
different ndev assigned (come from different netdevs).

To avoid performance issues for existing one-port CPSW2g devices the above
changes are done only for multi-port devices by splitting xmit path for
one-port and multi-port devices.
