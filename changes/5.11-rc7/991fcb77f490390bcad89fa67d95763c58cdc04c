drm/edid: Fix uninitialized variable in drm_cvt_modes()

Noticed this when trying to compile with -Wall on a kernel fork. We
potentially don't set width here, which causes the compiler to complain
about width potentially being uninitialized in drm_cvt_modes(). So, let's
fix that.

Changes since v1:
* Don't emit an error as this code isn't reachable, just mark it as such
Changes since v2:
* Remove now unused variable
