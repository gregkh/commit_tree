genirq/msi: Activate Multi-MSI early when MSI_FLAG_ACTIVATE_EARLY is set

When MSI_FLAG_ACTIVATE_EARLY is set (which is the case for PCI),
__msi_domain_alloc_irqs() performs the activation of the interrupt (which
in the case of PCI results in the endpoint being programmed) as soon as the
interrupt is allocated.

But it appears that this is only done for the first vector, introducing an
inconsistent behaviour for PCI Multi-MSI.

Fix it by iterating over the number of vectors allocated to each MSI
descriptor. This is easily achieved by introducing a new
"for_each_msi_vector" iterator, together with a tiny bit of refactoring.
