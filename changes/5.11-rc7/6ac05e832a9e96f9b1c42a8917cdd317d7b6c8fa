signal: define the SA_EXPOSE_TAGBITS bit in sa_flags

Architectures that support address tagging, such as arm64, may want to
expose fault address tag bits to the signal handler to help diagnose
memory errors. However, these bits have not been previously set,
and their presence may confuse unaware user applications. Therefore,
introduce a SA_EXPOSE_TAGBITS flag bit in sa_flags that a signal
handler may use to explicitly request that the bits are set.

The generic signal handler APIs expect to receive tagged addresses.
Architectures may specify how to untag addresses in the case where
SA_EXPOSE_TAGBITS is clear by defining the arch_untagged_si_addr
function.
