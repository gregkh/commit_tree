drm/amd/display: add i2c speed arbitration for dc_i2c and hdcp_i2c

[why]
HDCP 1.4 failed on SL8800 SW w/a test driver use.

[how]
slower down the HW i2c speed when used by HW i2c.
this request: each acquired_i2c_engine setup the i2c speed needed.
and set the I2c engine for HDCP use at release_engine.

this covers SW using HW I2c engine and HDCP using HW I2c engine. for
dmcu using HW I2c engine, needs add similar logic in dmcufw.
