habanalabs: mmu map wrapper for sizes larger than a page

We introduce a new wrapper which allows us to mmu map any size
to any host va_range available. In addition we remove duplicated
code from various places in driver and using this new wrapper
instead.
This wrapper supports mapping only contiguous physical
memory blocks and will be used for mappings that are done to the
driver ASID.
