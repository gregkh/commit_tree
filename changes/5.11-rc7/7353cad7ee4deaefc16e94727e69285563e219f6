USB: serial: keyspan_pda: fix write deadlock

The write() callback can be called in interrupt context (e.g. when used
as a console) so interrupts must be disabled while holding the port lock
to prevent a possible deadlock.

Fixes: e81ee637e4ae ("usb-serial: possible irq lock inversion (PPP vs. usb/serial)")
Fixes: 507ca9bc0476 ("[PATCH] USB: add ability for usb-serial drivers to determine if their write urb is currently being used.")
