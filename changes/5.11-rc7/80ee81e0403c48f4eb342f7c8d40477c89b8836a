bpf: Eliminate rlimit-based memory accounting infra for bpf maps

Remove rlimit-based accounting infrastructure code, which is not used
anymore.

To provide a backward compatibility, use an approximation of the
bpf map memory footprint as a "memlock" value, available to a user
via map info. The approximation is based on the maximal number of
elements and key and value sizes.
