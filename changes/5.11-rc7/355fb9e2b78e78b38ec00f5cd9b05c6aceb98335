io_uring: remove 'twa_signal_ok' deadlock work-around

The TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL based implementation of TWA_SIGNAL is always safe
to use, regardless of context, as we won't be recursing into the signal
lock. So now that all archs are using that, we can drop this deadlock
work-around as it's always safe to use TWA_SIGNAL.
