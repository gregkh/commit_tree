um: time: Fix read_persistent_clock64() in time-travel

In time-travel mode, we've relied on read_persistent_clock64()
being called only once at system startup, but this is both the
right thing to call from the pseudo-RTC, and also gets called
by the timekeeping core during suspend/resume.

Thus, fix this to always fall make use of the time_travel_time
in any time-travel mode, initializing time_travel_start at boot
to the right value depending on the time-travel mode.
