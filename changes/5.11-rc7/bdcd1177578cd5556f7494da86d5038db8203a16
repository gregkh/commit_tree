regulator: core: validate selector against linear_min_sel

There are regulators who's min selector is not zero. Selectors loops
(looping b/w zero and regulator::desc::n_voltages) might throw errors
because invalid selectors are used (lower than
regulator::desc::linear_min_sel). For this situations validate selectors
against regulator::desc::linear_min_sel.
