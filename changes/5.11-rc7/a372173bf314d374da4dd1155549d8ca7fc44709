RDMA/cxgb4: Fix the reported max_recv_sge value

The max_recv_sge value is wrongly reported when calling query_qp, This is
happening due to a typo when assigning the max_recv_sge value, the value
of sq_max_sges was assigned instead of rq_max_sges.

Fixes: 3e5c02c9ef9a ("iw_cxgb4: Support query_qp() verb")
