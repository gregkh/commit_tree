octeontx2-af: Mbox changes for 98xx

This patch puts together all mailbox changes
for 98xx silicon:

Attach ->
Modify resource attach mailbox handler to
request LFs from a block address out of multiple
blocks of same type. If a PF/VF need LFs from two
blocks of same type then attach mbox should be
called twice.

Example:
        struct rsrc_attach *attach;
        .. Allocate memory for message ..
        attach->cptlfs = 3; /* 3 LFs from CPT0 */
        .. Send message ..
        .. Allocate memory for message ..
        attach->modify = 1;
        attach->cpt_blkaddr = BLKADDR_CPT1;
        attach->cptlfs = 2; /* 2 LFs from CPT1 */
        .. Send message ..

Detach ->
Update detach mailbox and its handler to detach
resources from CPT1 and NIX1 blocks.

MSIX ->
Updated the MSIX mailbox and its handler to return
MSIX offsets for the new block CPT1.

Free resources ->
Update free_rsrc mailbox and its handler to return
the free resources count of new blocks NIX1 and CPT1

Links ->
Number of CGX,LBK and SDP links may vary between
platforms. For example, in 98xx number of CGX and LBK
links are more than 96xx. Hence the info about number
of links present in hardware is useful for consumers to
request link configuration properly. This patch sends
this info in nix_lf_alloc_rsp.
