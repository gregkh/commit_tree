iio: accel: bmc150: Check for a second ACPI device for BOSC0200

Some BOSC0200 acpi_device-s describe two accelerometers in a single ACPI
device. Normally we would handle this by letting the special
drivers/platform/x86/i2c-multi-instantiate.c driver handle the BOSC0200
ACPI id and let it instantiate 2 bmc150_accel type i2c_client-s for us.

But doing so changes the modalias for the first accelerometer
(which is already supported and used on many devices) from
acpi:BOSC0200 to i2c:bmc150_accel. The modalias is not only used
to load the driver, but is also used by hwdb matches in
/lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-sensor.hwdb which provide a mountmatrix to
userspace by setting the ACCEL_MOUNT_MATRIX udev property.

Switching the handling of the BOSC0200 over to i2c-multi-instantiate.c
will break the hwdb matches causing the ACCEL_MOUNT_MATRIX udev prop
to no longer be set. So switching over to i2c-multi-instantiate.c is
not an option.

Changes by Hans de Goede:
-Add explanation to the commit message why i2c-multi-instantiate.c
 cannot be used
-Also set the dev_name, fwnode and irq i2c_board_info struct members
 for the 2nd client
