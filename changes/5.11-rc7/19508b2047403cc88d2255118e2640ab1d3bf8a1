s390/dasd: Display FC Endpoint Security information via sysfs

Add a new sysfs attribute (fc_security) per device and per operational
channel path. The information of the current FC Endpoint Security state
is received through the CIO layer.

The state of the FC Endpoint Security can be either "Unsupported",
"Authentication", or "Encryption".

For example:
$ cat /sys/bus/ccw/devices/0.0.c600/fc_security
Encryption

If any of the operational paths is in a state different from all
others, the device sysfs attribute will display the additional state
"Inconsistent".

The sysfs attributes per paths are organised in a new directory called
"paths_info" with subdirectories for each path.

/sys/bus/ccw/devices/0.0.c600/paths_info/
