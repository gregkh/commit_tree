spi: synquacer: Disable clock in probe error path

If the calls to platform_get_irq() or devm_request_irq() fail on probe
of the SynQuacer SPI driver, the clock "sspi->clk" is erroneously not
unprepared and disabled.

If the clock rate "master->max_speed_hz" cannot be determined, the same
happens and in addition the spi_master struct is not freed.

Fix it.
