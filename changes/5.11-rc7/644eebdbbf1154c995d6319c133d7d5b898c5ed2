ASoC: soc-acpi: add helper to identify parent driver.

Intel machine drivers are used by parent platform drivers based on
closed-source firmware (Atom/SST and catpt) and SOF-based ones.

In some cases for ACPI-based platforms, the behavior of machine
drivers needs to be modified depending on the parent type, typically
for card names and power management.

An initial solution based on passing a boolean flag as a platform
device parameter was tested earlier. Since it looked overkill, this
patch suggests instead a simple string comparison to identify an SOF
parent device/driver.
