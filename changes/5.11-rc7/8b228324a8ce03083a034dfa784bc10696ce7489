btrfs: clear free space tree on ro->rw remount

A user might want to revert to v1 or nospace_cache on a root filesystem,
and much like turning on the free space tree, that can only be done
remounting from ro->rw. Support clearing the free space tree on such
mounts by moving it into the shared remount logic.

Since the CLEAR_CACHE option sticks around across remounts, this change
would result in clearing the tree for ever on every remount, which is
not desirable. To fix that, add CLEAR_CACHE to the oneshot options we
clear at mount end, which has the other bonus of not cluttering the
/proc/mounts output with clear_cache.
