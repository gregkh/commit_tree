PCI: Fix overflow in command-line resource alignment requests

The shift of 1 by align_order is evaluated using 32 bit arithmetic and the
result is assigned to a resource_size_t type variable that is a 64 bit
unsigned integer on 64 bit platforms. Fix an overflow before widening issue
by making the 1 a ULL.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unintentional integer overflow")
Fixes: 32a9a682bef2 ("PCI: allow assignment of memory resources with a specified alignment")
