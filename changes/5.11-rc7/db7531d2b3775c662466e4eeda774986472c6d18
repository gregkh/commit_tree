scsi: lpfc: Convert abort handling to SLI-3 and SLI-4 handlers

This patch reworks the abort interfaces such that SLI-3 retains the
iocb-based formatting and completions and SLI-4 now uses native WQEs and
completion routines.

The following changes are made:

 - The code is refactored from a confusing 2 routine sequence of
   xx_abort_iotag_issue(), which creates/formats and abort cmd, and
   xx_issue_abort_tag(), which then issues and handles the completion of
   the abort cmd - into a single interface of xx_issue_abort_iotag().  The
   new interface will determine whether SLI-3 or SLI-4 and then call the
   appropriate handler. A completion handler can now be specified to
   address the differences in completion handling.  Note: original code is
   all iocb based, with SLI-4 converting to SLI-3 for the SCSI/ELS path,
   and NVMe natively using wqes.

 - The SLI-3 side is refactored:

   The older iocb-base lpfc_sli_issue_abort_iotag() routine is combined
   with the logic of lpfc_sli_abort_iotag_issue() as well as the
   iocb-specific code in lpfc_abort_handler() and lpfc_sli_abort_iocb() to
   create the new single SLI-3 abort routine that formats and issues the
   iocb.

 - The SLI-4 side is refactored and added to:

   The native WQE abort code in NVMe is moved to the new SLI-4
   issue_abort_iotag() routine. Items in SCSI that set fields not set by
   NVMe is migrated into the new routine. Thus the routine supports NVMe
   and SCSI initiators. The nvmet block (target) formats the abort slightly
   different (like the old NVMe initiator) thus it has its own prep routine
   stolen from NVMe initiator and it retains the current code it has for
   issuing the WQE (does not use the commonized routine the initiators
   do). SLI-4 completion handlers were also added.

 - lpfc_abort_handler now becomes a wrapper that determines whether
   SLI-3 or SLI-4 and calls the proper abort handler.
