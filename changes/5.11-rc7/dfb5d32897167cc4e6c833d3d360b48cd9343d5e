media: camss: Make use of V4L2_CAP_IO_MC

Implement mbus_code filtering for format enumeration.

Without this patch libcamera errors out with:
"ERROR V4L2 v4l2_videodevice.cpp:982 /dev/video0[cap]: Media bus code
filtering not supported by the device"

This is the second version of this change which handles the case of
several pixel formats corresponding to one media bus format correctly.
