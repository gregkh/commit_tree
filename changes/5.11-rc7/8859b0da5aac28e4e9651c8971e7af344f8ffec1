tools/bpftool: Fix cross-build

The bpftool build first creates an intermediate binary, executed on the
host, to generate skeletons required by the final build. When
cross-building bpftool for an architecture different from the host, the
intermediate binary should be built using the host compiler (gcc) and
the final bpftool using the cross compiler (e.g. aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc).

Generate the intermediate objects into the bootstrap/ directory using
the host toolchain.
