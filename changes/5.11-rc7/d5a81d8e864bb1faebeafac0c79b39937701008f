platform/x86: panasonic-laptop: Add support for optical driver power in Y and W series

The physical optical drive switch is present in Y and W series that
switches on the drive but fails to turn it off. The idea is to be able to
toggle the drive power by software and/or hardware. This patch merges
Martin Lucina <mato@kotelna.sk>'s work that took care of the software part.

Code is also added for the physical switch to power off the drive.
