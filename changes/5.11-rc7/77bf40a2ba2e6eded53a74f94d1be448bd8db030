btrfs: extract extent buffer verification from btrfs_validate_metadata_buffer()

Currently btrfs_validate_metadata_buffer() only needs to handle one
extent buffer as currently one page maps to at most one extent buffer.

For incoming subpage support, we need to extend the support where one
page could contain multiple extent buffers.

Split the function so we can call validate_extent_buffer on extent
buffers independently.
