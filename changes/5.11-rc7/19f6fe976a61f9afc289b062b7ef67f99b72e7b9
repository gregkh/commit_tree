Revert "arm64: dts: amlogic: add missing ethernet reset ID"

It has been reported on IRC and in KernelCI boot tests, this change breaks
internal PHY support on the Amlogic G12A/SM1 Based boards.

We suspect the added signal to reset more than the Ethernet MAC but also
the MDIO/(RG)MII mux used to redirect the MAC signals to the internal PHY.

This reverts commit f3362f0c18174a1f334a419ab7d567a36bd1b3f3 while we find
and acceptable solution to cleanly reset the Ethernet MAC.
