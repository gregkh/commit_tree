dt-bindings: tegra30-actmon: Document OPP and interconnect properties

Document EMC DFS OPP table and interconnect paths that will be used
for scaling of system's memory bandwidth based on memory utilization
statistics. Previously ACTMON was supposed to drive EMC clock rate
directly, but now it should do it using interconnect framework in order
to support shared voltage scaling in addition to the frequency scaling.
