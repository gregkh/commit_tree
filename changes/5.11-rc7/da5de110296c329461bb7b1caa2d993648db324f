xfs: validate feature support when recovering rmap/refcount intents

The rmap, and refcount log intent items were added to support the rmap
and reflink features.  Because these features come with changes to the
ondisk format, the log items aren't tied to a log incompat flag.

However, the log recovery routines don't actually check for those
feature flags.  The kernel has no business replayng an intent item for a
feature that isn't enabled, so check that as part of recovered log item
validation.  (Note that kernels pre-dating rmap and reflink already fail
log recovery on the unknown log item type code.)
