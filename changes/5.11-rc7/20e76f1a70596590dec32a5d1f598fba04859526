dma-buf: Use struct dma_buf_map in dma_buf_vunmap() interfaces

This patch updates dma_buf_vunmap() and dma-buf's vunmap callback to
use struct dma_buf_map. The interfaces used to receive a buffer address.
This address is now given in an instance of the structure.

Users of the functions are updated accordingly. This is only an interface
change. It is currently expected that dma-buf memory can be accessed with
system memory load/store operations.

v2:
	* include dma-buf-heaps and i915 selftests (kernel test robot)
	* initialize cma_obj before using it in drm_gem_cma_free_object()
	  (kernel test robot)
