clk: bcm: dvp: drop a variable that is assigned to only

The third parameter to devm_platform_get_and_ioremap_resource() is used
only to provide the used resource. As this variable isn't used
afterwards, switch to the function devm_platform_ioremap_resource()
which doesn't provide this output parameter.
