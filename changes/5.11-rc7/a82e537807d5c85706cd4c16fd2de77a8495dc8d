pinctrl: qcom: Allow SoCs to specify a GPIO function that's not 0

There's currently a comment in the code saying function 0 is GPIO.
Instead of hardcoding it, let's add a member where an SoC can specify
it.  No known SoCs use a number other than 0, but this just makes the
code clearer.  NOTE: no SoC code needs to be updated since we can rely
on zero-initialization.
