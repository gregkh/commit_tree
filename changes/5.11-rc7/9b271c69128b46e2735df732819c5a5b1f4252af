scsi: mpt3sas: Handle trigger page after firmware update

If a firmware update adds support for the trigger pages, then the driver
should handle this by writing the existing trigger data from the driver's
internal data structure to the corresponding trigger pages in NVRAM.

Also handle the case where the trigger page capability is no longer present
after a firmware downgrade.
