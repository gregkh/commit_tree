cpufreq: tegra194: get consistent cpuinfo_cur_freq

Frequency returned by 'cpuinfo_cur_freq' using counters is not fixed
and keeps changing slightly. This change returns a consistent value
from freq_table. If the reconstructed frequency has acceptable delta
from the last written value, then return the frequency corresponding
to the last written ndiv value from freq_table. Otherwise, print a
warning and return the reconstructed freq.
