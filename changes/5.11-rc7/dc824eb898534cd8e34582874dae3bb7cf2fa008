sched/fair: Dissociate wakeup decisions from SD flag value

The CFS wakeup code will only ever go through EAS / its fast path on
"regular" wakeups (i.e. not on forks or execs). These are currently gated
by a check against 'sd_flag', which would be SD_BALANCE_WAKE at wakeup.

However, we now have a flag that explicitly tells us whether a wakeup is a
"regular" one, so hinge those conditions on that flag instead.
