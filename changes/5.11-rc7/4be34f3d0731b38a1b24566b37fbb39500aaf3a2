bpf: Don't leak memory in bpf getsockopt when optlen == 0

optlen == 0 indicates that the kernel should ignore BPF buffer
and use the original one from the user. We, however, forget
to free the temporary buffer that we've allocated for BPF.

Fixes: d8fe449a9c51 ("bpf: Don't return EINVAL from {get,set}sockopt when optlen > PAGE_SIZE")
