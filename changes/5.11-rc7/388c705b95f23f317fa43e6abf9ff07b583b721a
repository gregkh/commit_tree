bfq-iosched: Revert "bfq: Fix computation of shallow depth"

This reverts commit 6d4d273588378c65915acaf7b2ee74e9dd9c130a.

bfq.limit_depth passes word_depths[] as shallow_depth down to sbitmap core
sbitmap_get_shallow, which uses just the number to limit the scan depth of
each bitmap word, formula:
scan_percentage_for_each_word = shallow_depth / (1 << sbimap->shift) * 100%

That means the comments's percentiles 50%, 75%, 18%, 37% of bfq are correct.
But after commit patch 'bfq: Fix computation of shallow depth', we use
sbitmap.depth instead, as a example in following case:

sbitmap.depth = 256, map_nr = 4, shift = 6; sbitmap_word.depth = 64.
The resulsts of computed bfqd->word_depths[] are {128, 192, 48, 96}, and
three of the numbers exceed core dirver's 'sbitmap_word.depth=64' limit
nothing.
