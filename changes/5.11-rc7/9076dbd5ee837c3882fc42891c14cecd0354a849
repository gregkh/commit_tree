btrfs: do not shorten unpin len for caching block groups

While fixing up our ->last_byte_to_unpin locking I noticed that we will
shorten len based on ->last_byte_to_unpin if we're caching when we're
adding back the free space.  This is correct for the free space, as we
cannot unpin more than ->last_byte_to_unpin, however we use len to
adjust the ->bytes_pinned counters and such, which need to track the
actual pinned usage.  This could result in
WARN_ON(space_info->bytes_pinned) triggering at unmount time.

Fix this by using a local variable for the amount to add to free space
cache, and leave len untouched in this case.
