arm64: Force NO_BLOCK_MAPPINGS if crashkernel reservation is required

mem_init() currently relies on knowing the boundaries of the crashkernel
reservation to map such region with page granularity for later
unmapping via set_memory_valid(..., 0). If the crashkernel reservation
is deferred, such boundaries are not known when the linear mapping is
created. Simply parse the command line for "crashkernel" and, if found,
create the linear map with NO_BLOCK_MAPPINGS.
