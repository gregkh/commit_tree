bpf: Support PTR_TO_MEM{,_OR_NULL} register spilling

Add support for pointer to mem register spilling, to allow the verifier
to track pointers to valid memory addresses. Such pointers are returned
for example by a successful call of the bpf_ringbuf_reserve helper.

The patch was partially contributed by CyberArk Software, Inc.
