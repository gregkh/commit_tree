scsi: lpfc: Fix memory leak on lcb_context

Currently there is an error return path that neglects to free the
allocation for lcb_context.  Fix this by adding a new error free exit path
that kfree's lcb_context before returning.  Use this new kfree exit path in
another exit error path that also kfree's the same object, allowing a line
of code to be removed.
