x86/mce: Use "safe" MSR functions when enabling additional error logging

Booting as a guest under KVM results in error messages about
unchecked MSR access:

  unchecked MSR access error: RDMSR from 0x17f at rIP: 0xffffffff84483f16 (mce_intel_feature_init+0x156/0x270)

because KVM doesn't provide emulation for random model specific
registers.

Switch to using rdmsrl_safe()/wrmsrl_safe() to avoid the message.
