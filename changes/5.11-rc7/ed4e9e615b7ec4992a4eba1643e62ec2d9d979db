Documentation/llvm: Add a section about supported architectures

The most common question around building the Linux kernel with clang is
"does it work?" and the answer has always been "it depends on your
architecture, configuration, and LLVM version" with no hard answers for
users wanting to experiment. LLVM support has significantly improved
over the past couple of years, resulting in more architectures and
configurations supported, and continuous integration has made it easier
to see what works and what does not.

Add a section that goes over what architectures are supported in the
current kernel version, how they should be built (with just clang or the
LLVM utilities as well), and the level of support they receive. This
will make it easier for people to try out building their kernel with
LLVM and reporting issues that come about from it.
