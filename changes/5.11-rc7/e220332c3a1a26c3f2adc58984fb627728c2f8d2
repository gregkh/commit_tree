Revert "rtl8xxxu: Add Buffalo WI-U3-866D to list of supported devices"

This reverts commit 28606150768a20b291a35dbbbb0ab4dd7d4739db.
Since actually Buffalo WI-U3-866D is falied to power on with the change.

The rtl8812au driver code to power on is same with the rtl8821a code.
But the rtl8821ae included rtl8821a does not support USB interface.
So seems that rtl8812au should be supported by rt1l8821a code with USB.
