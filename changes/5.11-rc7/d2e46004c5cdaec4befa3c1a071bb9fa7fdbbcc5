s390/qeth: make qeth_qdio_handle_aob() more robust

When qeth_qdio_handle_aob() frees dangling allocations in the notified
TX buffer, there are rare tear-down cases where
qeth_drain_output_queue() would later call qeth_clear_output_buffer()
for the same buffer - and thus end up walking the buffer a second time
to check for dangling kmem_cache allocations.

Luckily current code previously scrubs such a buffer, so
qeth_clear_output_buffer() would find buf->buffer->element[i].addr as
NULL and not do anything. But this is fragile, and we can easily improve
it by consistently clearing the ->is_header flag after freeing the
allocation.
