ARM: head-common.S: use PC-relative insn sequence for idmap creation

Replace the open coded PC relative offset calculations involving
__turn_mmu_on and __turn_mmu_on_end with a pair of adr_l invocations.
This removes some open coded arithmetic involving virtual addresses,
avoids literal pools on v7+, and slightly reduces the footprint of the
code.
