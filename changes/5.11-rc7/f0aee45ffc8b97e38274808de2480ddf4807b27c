drm/panel: s6e63m0: Fix init sequence

The init sequence consist of a number of unknown settings
for the display controller. This patch achieves two things:

- Fix an error that must have happened when the driver was
  converted from the backlight subsystem: the 0xb8
  configuration command was lost and added as a tail to
  the previous command.

- Update some minor settings in some bytes here and there
  according to changes in the Samsung GT-I9070 and
  Samsung GT-S7710 code dumps. Since two other devices use
  these settings they probably reflect trimmings later
  found to be better for the display rather than
  customizations for these devices.
