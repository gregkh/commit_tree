usb: xhci-mtk: fix unreleased bandwidth data

xhci-mtk needs XHCI_MTK_HOST quirk functions in add_endpoint() and
drop_endpoint() to handle its own sw bandwidth management.

It stores bandwidth data into an internal table every time
add_endpoint() is called, and drops those in drop_endpoint().
But when bandwidth allocation fails at one endpoint, all earlier
allocation from the same interface could still remain at the table.

This patch moves bandwidth management codes to check_bandwidth() and
reset_bandwidth() path. To do so, this patch also adds those functions
to xhci_driver_overrides and lets mtk-xhci to release all failed
endpoints in reset_bandwidth() path.
