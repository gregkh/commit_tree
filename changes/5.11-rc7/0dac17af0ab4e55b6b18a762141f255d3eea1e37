drm/i915/dg1: Enable DPLL for DG1

Add DG1 DPLL Enable register macro and use the macro to enable the
correct DPLL based on PLL id. Although we use
_MG_PLL1_ENABLE/_MG_PLL2_ENABLE these are rather combo phys.

While at it, fix coding style: wrong newlines and use if/else chain

v2: Rewrite original patch from Aditya Swarup based on refactors
upstream
