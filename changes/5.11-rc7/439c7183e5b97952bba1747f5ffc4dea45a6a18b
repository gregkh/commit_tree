serial: 8250: 8250_omap: Disable RX interrupt after DMA enable

UARTs on TI SoCs prior to J7200 don't provide independent control over
RX FIFO not empty interrupt (RHR_IT) and RX timeout interrupt.
Starting with J7200 SoC, its possible to disable RHR_IT independent of
RX timeout interrupt using bit 2 of IER2 register. So disable RHR_IT
once RX DMA is started so as to avoid spurious interrupt being raised
when data is in the RX FIFO but is yet to be drained by DMA (a known
errata in older SoCs).
