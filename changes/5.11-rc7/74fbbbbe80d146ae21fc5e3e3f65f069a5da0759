net: ipa: rearrange a few IPA register definitions

Move a few things around in "ipa_reg.h":
  - Move the definition of ipa_reg_state_aggr_active_offset() down
    a bit in the file so definitions are ordered by offset (for
    the lowest supported IPA version) like all other definitions.
  - Move the definition TIMER_FREQUENCY to be immediately above
    the definition of ipa_aggr_granularity_val() where it's used.
  - Move each register field value enumerated type definition to
    immediately follow the definitions of the register and field
    it is associated with.
No code functionality is modified by this patch.
