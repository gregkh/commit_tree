KVM: x86: cleanup CR3 reserved bits checks

If not in long mode, the low bits of CR3 are reserved but not enforced to
be zero, so remove those checks.  If in long mode, however, the MBZ bits
extend down to the highest physical address bit of the guest, excluding
the encryption bit.

Make the checks consistent with the above, and match them between
nested_vmcb_checks and KVM_SET_SREGS.
