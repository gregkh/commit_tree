drm/amd/display: Decrement refcount of dc_sink before reassignment

[why]
An old dc_sink state is causing a memory leak because it is missing a
dc_sink_release before a new dc_sink is assigned back to
aconnector->dc_sink.

[how]
Decrement the dc_sink refcount before reassigning it to a new dc_sink.
