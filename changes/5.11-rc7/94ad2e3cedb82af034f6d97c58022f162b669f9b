tick/sched: Reduce seqcount held scope in tick_do_update_jiffies64()

If jiffies are up to date already (caller lost the race against another
CPU) there is no point to change the sequence count. Doing that just forces
other CPUs into the seqcount retry loop in tick_nohz_next_event() for
nothing.

Just bail out early.
