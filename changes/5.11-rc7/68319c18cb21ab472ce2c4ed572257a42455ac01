btrfs: show rescue=usebackuproot in /proc/mounts

The standalone option usebackuproot was intended as one-time use and it
was not necessary to keep it in the option list. Now that we're going to
have more rescue options, it's desirable to keep them intact as it could
be confusing why the option disappears.
