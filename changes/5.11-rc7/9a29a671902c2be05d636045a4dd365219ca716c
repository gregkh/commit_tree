elf: Expose ELF header on arch_setup_additional_pages()

Like it is done for SET_PERSONALITY with ARM, which requires the ELF
header to select correct personality parameters, x86 requires the
headers when selecting which VDSO to load, instead of relying on the
going-away TIF_IA32/X32 flags.

Add an indirection macro to arch_setup_additional_pages(), that x86 can
reimplement to receive the extra parameter just for ELF files.  This
requires no changes to other architectures, who can continue to use the
original arch_setup_additional_pages for ELF and non-ELF binaries.
