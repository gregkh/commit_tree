clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Use stable count reader in erratum sne

In commit 0ea415390cd3 ("clocksource/arm_arch_timer: Use arch_timer_read_counter
to access stable counters"), we separate stable and normal count reader to omit
unnecessary overhead on systems that have no timer erratum.

However, in erratum_set_next_event_tval_generic(), count reader becomes normal
reader. This converts it to stable reader.
