powerpc/64s: Convert some cpu_setup() and cpu_restore() functions to C

The only thing keeping the cpu_setup() and cpu_restore() functions
used in the cputable entries for Power7, Power8, Power9 and Power10 in
assembly was cpu_restore() being called before there was a stack in
generic_secondary_smp_init(). Commit ("powerpc/64: Set up a kernel
stack for secondaries before cpu_restore()") means that it is now
possible to use C.

Rewrite the functions in C so they are a little bit easier to read.
This is not changing their functionality.
