can: m_can: m_can_clk_start(): make use of pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

With patch

| dd8088d5a896 PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter

the usual pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put_noidle() in-case-of-error
dance is no longer needed. Convert the m_can driver to use this function.
