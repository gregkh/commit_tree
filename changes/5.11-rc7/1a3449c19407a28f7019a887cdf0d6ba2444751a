selftests/bpf: Clarify build error if no vmlinux

If Makefile cannot find any of the vmlinux's in its VMLINUX_BTF_PATHS list,
it tries to run btftool incorrectly, with VMLINUX_BTF unset:

    bpftool btf dump file $(VMLINUX_BTF) format c

Such that the keyword 'format' is misinterpreted as the path to vmlinux.
The resulting build error message is fairly cryptic:

      GEN      vmlinux.h
    Error: failed to load BTF from format: No such file or directory

This patch makes the failure reason clearer by yielding this instead:

    Makefile:...: *** Cannot find a vmlinux for VMLINUX_BTF at any of
    "{paths}".  Stop.
