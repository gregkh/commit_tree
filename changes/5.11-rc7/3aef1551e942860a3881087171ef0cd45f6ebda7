sched: Remove select_task_rq()'s sd_flag parameter

Only select_task_rq_fair() uses that parameter to do an actual domain
search, other classes only care about what kind of wakeup is happening
(fork, exec, or "regular") and thus just translate the flag into a wakeup
type.

WF_TTWU and WF_EXEC have just been added, use these along with WF_FORK to
encode the wakeup types we care about. For select_task_rq_fair(), we can
simply use the shiny new WF_flag : SD_flag mapping.
