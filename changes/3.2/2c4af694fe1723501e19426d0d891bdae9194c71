ixgbe: Correctly name and handle MSI-X other interrupt

It was possible to inadvertently add additional interrupt causes to the
MSI-X other interrupt.  This occurred when things such as RX buffer overrun
events were being triggered at the same time as an event such as a Flow
Director table reinit request.  In order to avoid this we should be
explicitly programming only the interrupts that we want enabled.  In
addition I am renaming the ixgbe_msix_lsc function and interrupt to drop
any implied meaning of this being a link status only interrupt.

Unfortunately the patch is a bit ugly due to the fact that ixgbe_irq_enable
needed to be moved up before ixgbe_msix_other in order to have things
defined in the correct order.
