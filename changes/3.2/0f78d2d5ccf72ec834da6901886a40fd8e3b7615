ARM: perf: lock PMU registers per-CPU

Currently, a single lock serialises access to CPU PMU registers. This
global locking is unnecessary as PMU registers are local to the CPU
they monitor.

This patch replaces the global lock with a per-CPU lock. As the lock is
in struct cpu_hw_events, PMUs providing a single cpu_hw_events instance
can be locked globally.
