vmscan.c: fix invalid strict_strtoul() check in write_scan_unevictable_node()

write_scan_unevictable_node() checks the value req returned by
strict_strtoul() and returns 1 if req is 0.

However, when strict_strtoul() returns 0, it means successful conversion
of buf to unsigned long.

Due to this, the function was not proceeding to scan the zones for
unevictable pages even though we write a valid value to the
scan_unevictable_pages sys file.

Change this check slightly to check for invalid value in buf as well as 0
value stored in res after successful conversion via strict_strtoul.  In
both cases, we do not perform the scanning of this node's zones.
