carl9170: export HW random number generator

All AR9170 hardware have a 16-Bit random number generator.
The documentation claims the values are suitable for
"security keys".

The "throughput" is around 320Kibit/s. It's slow, but it
does work without introducing any special offload
firmware commands.
