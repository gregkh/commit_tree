virtio-blk: use ida to allocate disk index

Based on a patch by Mark Wu <dwu@redhat.com>

Current index allocation in virtio-blk is based on a monotonically
increasing variable "index". This means we'll run out of numbers
after a while.  It also could cause confusion about the disk
name in the case of hot-plugging disks.
Change virtio-blk to use ida to allocate index, instead.
