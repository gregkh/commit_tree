Btrfs: reset cluster's max_size when creating bitmap

The field that indicates the size of the largest contiguous chunk of
free space in the cluster is not initialized when setting up bitmaps,
it's only increased when we find a larger contiguous chunk.  We end up
retaining a larger value than appropriate for highly-fragmented
clusters, which may cause pointless searches for large contiguous
groups, and even cause clusters that do not meet the density
requirements to be set up.
