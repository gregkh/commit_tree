staging: mei: removing dependency between WD and AMTHI init function.

AMTHI need to be initialized after WD Client was initialized, moving the AMTHI outside
of the WD initialization function.
in order to remove the coupling between the initialization of those clients.

AMTHI is getting initialized (getting connected to the FW feature/client) in two ways:
 1) if mei driver fails to send connect message to watchdog client (WD initialization), then
    immediately the AMTHI client getting initialized right after the watchdog initialization function.
 2) if Watchdog client success to send connect message to watchdog client, then only after
    the driver is getting the connect response message the AMTHI client is getting initialized
