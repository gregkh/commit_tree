perf: Do not set task_ctx pointer in cpuctx if there are no events in the context

Do not set task_ctx pointer during sched_in if there are no
events associated with the context.  Otherwise if during task
execution total number of events in the system will become zero
perf_event_context_sched_out() will not be called and cpuctx->task_ctx
will be left with a stale value.
