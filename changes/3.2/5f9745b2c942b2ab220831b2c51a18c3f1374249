[media] staging: as102: Add Elgato EyeTV DTT Deluxe

Add support for the Elgato EyeTV DTT Deluxe.  Note that the product name
field has not yet been abstracted out, so it will still identify itself
as a PCTV 74e.  The driver was originally built by the chipset manufacturer
so that the product vendor can specify the device name via a #define, but
wasn't setup to support multiple products from the same build of the driver.

Thanks to Joerg Unglaub for suggesting this change.
