ARM: vfp: use -mfloat-abi=soft to build vfp

Distros are starting to ship with toolchains defaulting to
hardfloat. Using such a compiler to build the kernel fails
in the VFP directory with

arch/arm/vfp/entry.S:1:0: sorry, unimplemented: -mfloat-abi=hard and VFP

Adding -mfloat-abi=soft to the gcc command line fixes this.
