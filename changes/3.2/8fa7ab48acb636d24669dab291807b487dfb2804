ALSA: hda - Fix surround/CLFE headphone and speaker pins order

When 5.1 or more headphone or speaker pins are provided, the parser still
takes as is without fixing the order of channel mapping, which leads in
the unexpected strange channel order by surround outputs.

This patch fixes the issue by applying the same fix-up not only to
line_out_pins[] but also hp_pins[] and speaker_pins[].
