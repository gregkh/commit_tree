KVM guest: prevent tracing recursion with kvmclock

Prevent tracing of preempt_disable() in get_cpu_var() in
kvm_clock_read(). When CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is enabled,
preempt_disable/enable() are traced and this causes the function_graph
tracer to go into an infinite recursion. By open coding the
preempt_disable() around the get_cpu_var(), we can use the notrace
version which prevents preempt_disable/enable() from being traced and
prevents the recursion.

Based on a similar patch for Xen from Jeremy Fitzhardinge.
