jump_label: add arch_jump_label_transform_static() to optimise non-live code updates

When updating a newly loaded module, the code is definitely not yet
executing on any processor, so it can be updated with no need for any
heavyweight synchronization.

This patch adds arch_jump_label_static() which is implemented as
arch_jump_label_transform() by default, but architectures can override
it if it avoids, say, a call to stop_machine().
