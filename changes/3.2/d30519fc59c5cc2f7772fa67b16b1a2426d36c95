md: clear In_sync bit on devices added to an active array.

When we add a device to an active array it can be meaningful to set
the 'insync' flag.  This indicates that the device is in-sync with the
array except for locations recorded in the bitmap.
A bitmap-based recovery can then bring it completely in-sync.

Internally we move that flag to 'saved_raid_disk' but forgot to clear
In_sync like we do in add_new_disk.

So clear In_sync after moving its value to saved_raid_disk.
