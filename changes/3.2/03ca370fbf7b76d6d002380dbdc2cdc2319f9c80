PM / OPP: Add OPP availability change notifier.

The patch enables to register notifier_block for an OPP-device in order
to get notified for any changes in the availability of OPPs of the
device. For example, if a new OPP is inserted or enable/disable status
of an OPP is changed, the notifier is executed.

This enables the usage of opp_add, opp_enable, and opp_disable to
directly take effect with any connected entities such as cpufreq or
devfreq.
