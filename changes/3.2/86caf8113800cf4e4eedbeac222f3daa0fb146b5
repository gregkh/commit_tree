[media] drivers/media: fix dependencies in video mt9t001/mt9p031

Both mt9t001.c and mt9p031.c have two identical issues, those
being that they will need module.h inclusion for the upcoming
cleanup going on there, and that their dependencies don't limit
selection of configs that will fail to compile as follows:

The related config options are CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER and
CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API.  Looking at the code, it appears
that the driver was never intended to work without these enabled,
so add a dependency on CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API, which in
turn already has a dependency on CONFIG_MEDIA_CONTROLLER.
