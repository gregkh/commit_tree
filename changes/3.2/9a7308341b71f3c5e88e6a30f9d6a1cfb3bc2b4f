ath6kl: silence "invalid rate" warning

For some reason firmware is sending invalid rates when we try to
query current bitrate from ath6kl_get_station() and a warning is issued:

[ 3810.415720] ath6kl: invalid rate: 1935633515
[ 3811.105493] ath6kl: invalid rate: 1935633515
[ 3811.556063] ath6kl: invalid rate: 1935633515

As the warning happens way too often, convert the warning to a debug
message once we have a proper fix. But to make it easy to follow
how often the problem appears, add a debugfs to print
various statistics about workarounds and make this issue the first WAR.
