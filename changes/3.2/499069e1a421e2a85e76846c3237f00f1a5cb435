[S390] take mmap_sem when walking guest page table

gmap_fault needs to walk the guest page table. However, parts of
that may change if some other thread does munmap. In that case
gmap_unmap_notifier will also unmap the corresponding parts from
the guest page table. We need to take mmap_sem in order to serialize
these operations.
do_exception now calls __gmap_fault with mmap_sem held which does
not get exported to modules. The exported function, which is called
from KVM, now takes mmap_sem.
