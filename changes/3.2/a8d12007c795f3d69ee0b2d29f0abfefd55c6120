n_gsm: Fix timings

Alek Du reported that the code erroneously applies time to jiffies
conversions twice to the t1 and t2 values. In normal use on a modem link
this cases no visible problem but on a slower link it will break as with
HZ=1000 as is typical we are running t1/t2 ten times too fast.

Alek's original patch removed the conversion from the timer setting but we
in fact have to be more careful as the contents of t1/t2 are visible via
the device API and we thus need to correct the constants.
