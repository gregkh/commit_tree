ARM: perf: remove cpu-related misnomers

Currently struct cpu_hw_events stores data on events running on a
PMU associated with a CPU. As this data is general enough to be used
for system PMUs, this name is a misnomer, and may cause confusion when
it is used for system PMUs.

Additionally, 'armpmu' is commonly used as a parameter name for an
instance of struct arm_pmu. The name is also used for a global instance
which represents the CPU's PMU.

As cpu_hw_events is now not tied to CPU PMUs, it is renamed to
pmu_hw_events, with instances of it renamed similarly. As the global
'armpmu' is CPU-specfic, it is renamed to cpu_pmu. This should make it
clearer which code is generic, and which is coupled with the CPU.
