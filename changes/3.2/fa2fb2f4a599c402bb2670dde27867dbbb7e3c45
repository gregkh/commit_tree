[S390] pfault: ignore leftover completion interrupts

Ignore completion interrupts if the initial interrupt hasn't been
received and the addressed task is not running. This case can only
happen if leftover (pending) completion interrupt gets delivered
which wasn't removed with the PFAULT CANCEL operation during cpu
hotplug.
