cpuidle: Split cpuidle_state structure and move per-cpu statistics fields

This is the first step towards global registration of cpuidle
states. The statistics used primarily by the governor are per-cpu
and have to be split from rest of the fields inside cpuidle_state,
which would be made global i.e. single copy. The driver_data field
is also per-cpu and moved.
