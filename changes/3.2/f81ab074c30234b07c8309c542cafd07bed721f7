trace: Add a new readonly entry to report total buffer size

The current file "buffer_size_kb" reports the size of per-cpu buffer and
not the overall memory allocated which could be misleading. A new file
"buffer_total_size_kb" adds up all the enabled CPU buffer sizes and
reports it. This is only a readonly entry.
