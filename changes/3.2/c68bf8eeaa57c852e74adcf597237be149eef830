[SCSI] st: fix race in st_scsi_execute_end

The call to complete() in st_scsi_execute_end() wakes up sleeping thread
in write_behind_check(), which frees the st_request, thus invalidating
the pointer to the associated bio structure, which is then passed to the
blk_rq_unmap_user(). Fix by storing pointer to bio structure into
temporary local variable.

This bug is present since at least linux-2.6.32.
