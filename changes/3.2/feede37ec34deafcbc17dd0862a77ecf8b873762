acpi: remove module.h include from platform/aclinux.h

This file had an include of module.h which was probably added
in relation to this line:

  #define ACPI_EXPORT_SYMBOL(symbol)  EXPORT_SYMBOL(symbol);

However, we really expect symbol exporters to grab export.h
themselves, and since this is only a define, we can remove
the module.h include without aclinux.h itself causing any
compile issues.
