Btrfs: stop passing a trans handle all around the reservation code

The only thing that we need to have a trans handle for is in
reserve_metadata_bytes and thats to know how much flushing we can do.  So
instead of passing it around, just check current->journal_info for a
trans_handle so we know if we can commit a transaction to try and free up space
or not.  Thanks,
