xfs: avoid synchronous transactions when deleting attr blocks

Currently xfs_attr_inactive causes a synchronous transactions if we are
removing a file that has any extents allocated to the attribute fork, and
thus makes XFS extremely slow at removing files with out of line extended
attributes. The code looks a like a relict from the days before the busy
extent list, but with the busy extent list we avoid reusing data and attr
extents that have been freed but not commited yet, so this code is just
as superflous as the synchronous transactions for data blocks.
