cifs: make smb_msg local to read_from_socket

If msg_controllen is 0, then the socket layer should never touch these
fields. Thus, there's no need to continually reset them. Also, there's
no need to keep this field on the stack for the demultiplex thread, just
make it a local variable in read_from_socket.
