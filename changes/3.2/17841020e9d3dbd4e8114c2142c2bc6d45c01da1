ASoC: soc-core: symmetry checking for each DAIs separately

The orginal code does not cover the case that one DAI such as codec
may be shared between other two DAIs(CPU).
When do symmetry checking, altough the codec DAI requires symmetry,
the two CPU DAIs may still be configured to run on different rates.

We change to check each DAI's state separately instead of only checking
the dai link to prevent this issue.
