ARM: mach-shmobile: Kota2 SDHI0 and SDHI1 support

Add SDHI0 and SDHI1 support to the Kota2 board.

SDHI0 is hooked up to a microSD card slot and SDHI1
to a wireless module that also connects to SCIFB.

This depends on the recently merged code for
TMIO_MMC_HAS_IDLE_WAIT together with PFC support
for pull-ups on SDHI0 and SDHI1.
