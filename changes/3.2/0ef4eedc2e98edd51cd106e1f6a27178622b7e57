e1000: convert to private mutex from rtnl

The e1000 driver when running with lockdep could run into
some possible deadlocks between the work items acquiring
rtnl and the rtnl lock being acquired before work items
were cancelled.

Use a private mutex to make sure lock ordering isn't violated.
The private mutex is only used to protect areas not generally
covered by the rtnl lock already.
