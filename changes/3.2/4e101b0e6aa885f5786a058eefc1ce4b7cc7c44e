lib/spinlock_debug.c: print owner on spinlock lockup

When SPIN_BUG_ON is triggered, the lock owner information is reported.
But it is omitted when spinlock lockup is detected.

This information is useful especially on the architectures which don't
implement trigger_all_cpu_backtrace() that is called just after detecting
lockup.  So report it and also avoid message format duplication.
