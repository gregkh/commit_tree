crypto: padlock-aes - Make module loading even quieter when hardware is missing

When loading aes via the module alias, a padlock module failing to
load due to missing hardware is not particularly notable.  With
v2.6.27-rc1~1107^2~14 (crypto: padlock - Make module loading quieter
when hardware isn't available, 2008-07-03), the padlock-aes module
suppresses the relevant messages when the "quiet" flag is in use; but
better to suppress this particular message completely, since the
administrator can already distinguish such errors by the absence of a
message indicating initialization failing or succeeding.

This avoids occasional messages in syslog of the form

	padlock_aes: VIA PadLock not detected.
