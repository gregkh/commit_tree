x86, UV: Fix UV2 hub part number

There was a mixup when the SGI UV2 hub chip was sent to be
fabricated, and it ended up with the wrong part number in the
HRP_NODE_ID mmr. Future versions of the chip will (may) have the
correct part number. Change the UV infrastructure to recognize
both part numbers as valid IDs of a UV2 hub chip.
