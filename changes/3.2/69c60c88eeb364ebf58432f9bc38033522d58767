x86: Fix files explicitly requiring export.h for EXPORT_SYMBOL/THIS_MODULE

These files were implicitly getting EXPORT_SYMBOL via device.h
which was including module.h, but that will be fixed up shortly.

By fixing these now, we can avoid seeing things like:

arch/x86/kernel/rtc.c:29: warning: type defaults to ‘int’ in declaration of ‘EXPORT_SYMBOL’
arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma.c:20: warning: type defaults to ‘int’ in declaration of ‘EXPORT_SYMBOL’
arch/x86/kernel/e820.c:69: warning: type defaults to ‘int’ in declaration of ‘EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL’
