mtd: nand: begin restructuring check_create

We will begin restructuring the code for check_create so that we can
make some important changes. For now, we should just begin to get rid of
some goto statements to make things cleaner. This is the first step of a
few, which are separated to make them easier to follow.

This step should just be a code refactor.
