ALSA: hdspm - Enable all firmware ranges for PCI MADI/AES cards

From the Windows INF file, we know the firmware ranges for all RME
cards. For PCIe, a single revision ID per device (RayDAT, MADI, AIO,
AES) is used. Contrary, the older PCI versions use ranges, that is,
one revision ID per firmware version.

Instead of listing all possible revisions individually, match the range.

This commit enables all MADI and AES PCI versions ever shipped.
