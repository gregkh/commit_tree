drm/i915: pass ELD to HDMI/DP audio driver

Add ELD support for Intel Eaglelake, IbexPeak/Ironlake,
SandyBridge/CougarPoint and IvyBridge/PantherPoint chips.

ELD (EDID-Like Data) describes to the HDMI/DP audio driver the audio
capabilities of the plugged monitor. It's built and passed to audio
driver in 2 steps:

(1) at get_modes time, parse EDID and save ELD to drm_connector.eld[]

(2) at mode_set time, write drm_connector.eld[] to the Transcoder's hw
    ELD buffer and set the ELD_valid bit to inform HDMI/DP audio driver

This patch is tested OK on G45/HDMI, IbexPeak/HDMI and IvyBridge/HDMI+DP.
Test scheme: plug in the HDMI/DP monitor, and run

        cat /proc/asound/card0/eld*

to check if the monitor name, HDMI/DP type, etc. show up correctly.

Minor imperfection: the GEN5_AUD_CNTL_ST/DIP_Port_Select field always
reads 0 (reserved). Without knowing the port number, I worked it around
by setting the ELD_valid bit for ALL the three ports. It's tested to not
be a problem, because the audio driver will find invalid ELD data and
hence rightfully abort, even when it sees the ELD_valid indicator.

Thanks to Zhenyu and Pierre-Louis for a lot of valuable help and testing.
