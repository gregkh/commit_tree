[SCSI] qlogicpti: fix timeout

qlogicpti times out for some tape library operations (like mtx
inventory). It seems SCSI command timeout is hardcoded into the driver.
Fix it by propagating the timeout from scsi request to the controller as
suggested by James Bottomley.

Tested on Sun Ultra 1 with Sun StorEdge L8 Autoloader.
