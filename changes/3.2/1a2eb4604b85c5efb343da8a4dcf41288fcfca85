drm/i915: Hook up Ivybridge eDP

The Ivybridge eDP control register looks like a cross between a
Cougarpoint PCH DP control register and a Sandybridge eDP control
register.

Where things trivially match, share the code. Where there are any
tricky bits, just split things out into two obviously separate code paths.
