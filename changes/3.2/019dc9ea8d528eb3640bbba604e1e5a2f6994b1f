serial/imx: support to handle break character

The imx UART hardware controller can identify BREAK character and the
imx_set_termios() can accept BRKINT set by users, but current existing
imx_rxint() can't pass BREAK character and TTY_BREAK to the tty layer
as other serial drivers do (8250.c omap_serial.c).

Here add code to handle BREAK character and pass it to tty layer.

To detect error occurrence, i use URXD_ERR to replace (URXD_OVRRUN |
URXD_FRMERR | ...) because any kind of error occurs, URXD_ERR will
always be set to 1.

I put the URXD_BRK to the first place to check since when BREAK error
occurs, not only URXD_BRK is set to 1, but also URXD_PRERR and
URXD_FRMERR are all set to 1. This arrangement can filter out fake
parity and frame errors when BREAK error occurs.
