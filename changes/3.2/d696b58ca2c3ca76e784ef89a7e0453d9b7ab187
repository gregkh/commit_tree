tracing: Do not allocate buffer for trace_marker

When doing intense tracing, the kmalloc inside trace_marker can
introduce side effects to what is being traced.

As trace_marker() is used by userspace to inject data into the
kernel ring buffer, it needs to do so with the least amount
of intrusion to the operations of the kernel or the user space
application.

As the ring buffer is designed to write directly into the buffer
without the need to make a temporary buffer, and userspace already
went through the hassle of knowing how big the write will be,
we can simply pin the userspace pages and write the data directly
into the buffer. This improves the impact of tracing via trace_marker
tremendously!

Thanks to Peter Zijlstra and Thomas Gleixner for pointing out the
use of get_user_pages_fast() and kmap_atomic().
