dccp: send Confirm options only once

If a connection is in the OPEN state, remove feature negotiation Confirm
options from the list of options after sending them once; as such options
are NOT supposed to be retransmitted and are ONLY supposed to be sent in
response to a Change option (RFC 4340 6.2).
