ASoC: claim the IRQ when the fsl_ssi device is probed, not opened

The PowerPC Freescale SSI driver is claiming the IRQ when the IRQ when
the device is opened, which means that the /proc/interrupts entry for
the SSI exists only during playback or capture.  This also meant that
the user won't know that the IRQ number is wrong until he tries to use
the device.  Instead, we should claim the IRQ when the device is probed.
