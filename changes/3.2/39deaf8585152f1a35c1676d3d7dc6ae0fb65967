mm: compaction: make isolate_lru_page() filter-aware

In async mode, compaction doesn't migrate dirty or writeback pages.  So,
it's meaningless to pick the page and re-add it to lru list.

Of course, when we isolate the page in compaction, the page might be dirty
or writeback but when we try to migrate the page, the page would be not
dirty, writeback.  So it could be migrated.  But it's very unlikely as
isolate and migration cycle is much faster than writeout.

So, this patch helps cpu overhead and prevent unnecessary LRU churning.
