Revert "Scm: Remove unnecessary pid & credential references in Unix socket's send and receive path"

This reverts commit 0856a304091b33a8e8f9f9c98e776f425af2b625.

As requested by Eric Dumazet, it has various ref-counting
problems and has introduced regressions.  Eric will add
a more suitable version of this performance fix.
