staging: zram: fix zram locking

Currently init_lock only prevents concurrent execution of zram_init_device()
and zram_reset_device() but not zram_make_request() nor sysfs store functions.

This patch changes init_lock into a rw_semaphore. A write lock is taken by
init, reset and store functions, a read lock is taken by zram_make_request().
Also, avoids to release the lock before calling __zram_reset_device() for
cleaning after a failed init, thus preventing any concurrent task to see an
inconsistent state of zram.
