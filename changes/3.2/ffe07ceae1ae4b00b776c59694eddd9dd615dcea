ARM: OMAP: dmtimer: pm_runtime support

Add pm_runtime feature to dmtimer whereby *_runtime_get_sync()
is called within omap_dm_timer_enable(), pm_runtime_put()
is called in omap_dm_timer_disable(). In addition to calling
pm_runtime_enable, we are calling pm_runtime_irq_safe so that
they can be called from interrupt context.
