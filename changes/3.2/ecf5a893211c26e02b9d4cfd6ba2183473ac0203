ARM: perf: index PMU registers from zero

ARM PMU code used to use 1-based indices for PMU registers. This caused
several data structures (pmu_hw_events::{active_events, used_mask, events})
to have an unused element at index zero. ARMPMU_MAX_HWEVENTS still takes
this indexing into account, and currently equates to 33.

This patch updates the core ARM perf code to use the 0th index again.
