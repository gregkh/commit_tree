mwifiex: correct AMSDU aggregation check

The commit "mwifiex: remove list traversal.."(fcf2176c87..)
wrongly modifies AMSDU aggregation check. Due to this even though
packet size for iperf traffic is already large, we unnecessarily
try to aggregate them which adds some delay. If Tx iperf is started
on UUT for 30 seconds, UUT keeps sending Tx packets for few more
seconds.

That commit is reverted to fix the problem.
Also, MIN_NUM_AMSDU check is moved inside the loop to optimize the
loop.
