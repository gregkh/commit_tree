[SCSI] libsas: disable scanning lun > 0 on ata devices

Currently mvsas and pm8001 have custom ->slave_alloc implementations to
achieve this.  Uplevel it for all libsas drivers as isci encounters problems
with atapi devices when scanning past lun0.

Just do what Darrick suggested [1], and limit the scan for ata devices.
