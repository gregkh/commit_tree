ipv4:correct description for tcp_max_syn_backlog

Since commit c5ed63d66f24(tcp: fix three tcp sysctls tuning),
sysctl_max_syn_backlog is determined by tcp_hashinfo->ehash_mask,
and the minimal value is 128, and it will increase in proportion to the
memory of machine.
The original description for tcp_max_syn_backlog and sysctl_max_syn_backlog
are out of date.
