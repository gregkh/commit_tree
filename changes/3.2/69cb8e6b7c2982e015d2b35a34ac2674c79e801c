slub: free slabs without holding locks

There are two situations in which slub holds a lock while releasing
pages:

	A. During kmem_cache_shrink()
	B. During kmem_cache_close()

For A build a list while holding the lock and then release the pages
later. In case of B we are the last remaining user of the slab so
there is no need to take the listlock.

After this patch all calls to the page allocator to free pages are
done without holding any spinlocks. kmem_cache_destroy() will still
hold the slub_lock semaphore.
