drm/i915: fix ILK+ infoframe support

Misc fixes based on tests with an infoframe analyzer:
  - checksum *does* include header bytes
  - DIP enable & AVI infoframe are tied together in hw, so disable both
    and make sure AVI frames are enabled first
  - use every vsync flag for SPD frames to avoid reserved value in
    frequency field when enabling both AVI & SPD
