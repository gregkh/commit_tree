parport_pc: release IO region properly if unsupported ITE887x card is found

sio_ite_8872_probe() bails out if it detects no-parallel (1S, 2S) or
unknown card.

It doesn't call release_region() on the previously allocated resource
though.  This causes

  (a) leak of the resource
  (b) kernel oops when parport module is removed and /proc/ioports is read. This
      is because the string that has been associated to the IO port region
      is a static char array inside the already removed module.

Let's call release_region() properly before baling out.
