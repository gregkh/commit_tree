ocfs2: send correct UUID to cleancache initialization

ocfs2: Fix cleancache initialization call to correctly pass uuid

As reported by Steven Whitehouse in https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/27/221
the ocfs2 volume UUID is incorrectly passed to cleancache.
As a result, shared-ephemeral tmem pools will not actually
be created; instead they will be private (unshared) which
misses out on a major benefit of tmem.
