time: Improve documentation of timekeeeping_adjust()

After getting a number of questions in private emails about the
math around admittedly very complex timekeeping_adjust() and
timekeeping_big_adjust(), I figure the code needs some better
comments.

Hopefully the explanations are clear enough and don't muddy the
water any worse.

Still needs documentation for ntp_error, but I couldn't recall
exactly the full explanation behind the code that's there
(although I do recall once working it out when Roman first
proposed it). Given a bit more time I can probably work it out,
but I don't want to hold back this documentation until then.
