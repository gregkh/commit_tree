vmwgfx: fix incorrect VRAM size check in vmw_kms_fb_create()

Commit e133e737 didn't correctly fix the integer overflow issue.

-	unsigned int required_size;
+	u64 required_size;
	...
	required_size = mode_cmd->pitch * mode_cmd->height;
-	if (unlikely(required_size > dev_priv->vram_size)) {
+	if (unlikely(required_size > (u64) dev_priv->vram_size)) {

Note that both pitch and height are u32.  Their product is still u32 and
would overflow before being assigned to required_size.  A correct way is
to convert pitch and height to u64 before the multiplication.

	required_size = (u64)mode_cmd->pitch * (u64)mode_cmd->height;

This patch calls the existing vmw_kms_validate_mode_vram() for
validation.
