ASoC: DAPM: Allow multiple mixer sources to be routed via the same switch

Currently it is only possible to route one source per switch into a mixer.
This patch modifies the code, so that it is possible to route multiple sources
into a mixer via the same switch. One use-case for this is routing a stereo
channel pair into a mono-mixer via the same switch.
