block: Always check length of all iov entries in blk_rq_map_user_iov()

Even after commit 5478755616ae2ef1ce144dded589b62b2a50d575
("block: check for proper length of iov entries earlier ...")
we still won't check for zero-length entries after an unaligned
entry.  Remove the break-statement, so all entries are checked.
