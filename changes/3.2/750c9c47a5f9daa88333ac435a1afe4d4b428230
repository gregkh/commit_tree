ext4: remove messy logic from ext4_ext_rm_leaf

- Both callers(truncate and punch_hole) already aligned left end point
  so we no longer need split logic here.
- Remove dead duplicated code.
- Call ext4_ext_dirty only after we have updated eh_entries, otherwise
  we'll loose entries update. Regression caused by d583fb87a3ff0
