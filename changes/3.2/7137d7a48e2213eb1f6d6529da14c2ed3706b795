ext4: convert instances of EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP to EXT4_CLUSTERS_PER_GROUP

Change the places in fs/ext4/mballoc.c where EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP are
used to indicate the number of bits in a block bitmap (which is really
a cluster allocation bitmap in bigalloc file systems).  There are
still some places in the ext4 codebase where usage of
EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP needs to be audited/fixed, in code paths that
aren't used given the initial restricted assumptions for bigalloc.
These will need to be fixed before we can relax those restrictions.
