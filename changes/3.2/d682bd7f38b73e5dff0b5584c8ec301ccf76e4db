Revert "HID: multitouch: decide if hid-multitouch needs to handle mt devices"

This reverts commit 0db3bfc72adf0c (""HID: multitouch: decide if hid-multitouch
needs to handle mt devices").

The generic detection of hid-mt devices has two major flaws, and was
merged prematurely. Firstly, the hid-multitouch gets loaded even when
the device is handled by a special device. Secondly, the patch only
partially duplicates the device whitelist already present in hid-core,
effectively rendering a number of devices non-functional.
