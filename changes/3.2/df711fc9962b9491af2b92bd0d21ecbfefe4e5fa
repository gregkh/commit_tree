xHCI: reset-on-resume quirk for NEC uPD720200

Julian Sikorski reports NEC uPD720200 does not work stable after suspend
and resume. Re-initialize the host in xhci_resume().

This should be backported to stable kernels as old as 2.6.37.  The
kernel will need to include
commit c877b3b2ad5cb9d4fe523c5496185cc328ff3ae9
"xhci: Add reset on resume quirk for asrock p67 host"
for this patch to work.
