mm: zone_reclaim: make isolate_lru_page() filter-aware

In __zone_reclaim case, we don't want to shrink mapped page.  Nonetheless,
we have isolated mapped page and re-add it into LRU's head.  It's
unnecessary CPU overhead and makes LRU churning.

Of course, when we isolate the page, the page might be mapped but when we
try to migrate the page, the page would be not mapped.  So it could be
migrated.  But race is rare and although it happens, it's no big deal.
