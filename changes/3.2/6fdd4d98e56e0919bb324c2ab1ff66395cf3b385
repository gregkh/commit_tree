drm/i915: properly cancel rps_work on module unload v2

The rps disabling code wasn't properly cancelling outstanding work
items. Also add a comment that explains why we're not racing with
the work item that could unmask interrupts - that piece of code
confused me quite a bit.

v2: Ben Widawsky pointed out that the first patch would deadlock
(and a few lesser problems). All corrected.
