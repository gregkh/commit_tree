mac80211: also expire filtered frames

mac80211 will expire normal PS-buffered frames, but
if the device rejected some frames for a sleeping
station, these won't be on the ps_tx_buf queue but
on the tx_filtered queue instead; this is done to
avoid reordering.

However, mac80211 will not expire frames from the
filtered queue, let's fix that.

Also add a more comments to what all this expiry is
doing and how it works.
