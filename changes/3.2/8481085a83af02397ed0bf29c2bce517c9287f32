staging: et131x: Fix indefinite low power sleep

The mechanism by which the device is put into low power sleep is broken
in that the device can never come back out of low power mode afterwards.
Temorary fix to bring the device back out of sleep almost immediately,
until a suitable wake trigger can be found.
