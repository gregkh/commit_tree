ehea: Simplify ehea_xmit2 and ehea_xmit3

Based on a patch from Michael Ellerman, clean up a significant
portion of the transmit path. There was a lot of duplication here.
Even worse, we were always checksumming tx packets and ignoring the
skb->ip_summed field.

Also remove NETIF_F_FRAGLIST from dev->features, I'm not sure why
it was enabled.
