ARM: EXYNOS4: use dma-pl330 device name for clock

This change replaces s3c-pl330.x clock device names with dma-pl330.x,
otherwise there won't be a correspondence between clock device name
and amba device name, thus clocks can't be enabled.

Fixes runtime errors on clk_get() from drivers/dma/pl330.c:
  dma-pl330 dma-pl330.0: Cannot get operation clock.
  dma-pl330: probe of dma-pl330.0 failed with error -22
