ACPI: Export FADT pm_profile integer value to userspace

There are a lot userspace approaches to detect the usage of the
platform (laptop, workstation, server, ...) and adjust kernel tunables
accordingly (io/process scheduler, power management, ...).

These approaches need constant maintaining and are ugly to implement
(detect PCMCIA controller -> laptop,
does not work on recent systems anymore, ...)
On ACPI systems there is an easy and reliable way (if implemented
in BIOS and most recent platforms have this value set).
-> export it to userspace.
