ocfs2/dlm: Take inflight reference count for remotely mastered resources too

The inflight reference count, in the lock resource, is taken to pin the resource
in memory. We take it when a new resource is created and release it after a
lock is attached to it. We do this to prevent the resource from getting purged
prematurely.

Earlier this reference count was being taken for locally mastered resources
only. This patch extends the same functionality for remotely mastered ones.

We are doing this because the same premature purging could occur for remotely
mastered resources if the remote node were to die before completion of the
create lock.

Fix for Oracle bug#12405575.
