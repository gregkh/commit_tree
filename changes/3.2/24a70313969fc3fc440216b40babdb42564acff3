Btrfs: remove free-space-cache.c WARN during log replay

The log replay code only partially loads block groups, since
the block group caching code is able to detect and deal with
extents the logging code has pinned down.

While the logging code is pinning down block groups, there is
a bogus WARN_ON we're hitting if the code wasn't able to find
an extent in the cache.  This commit removes the warning because
it can happen any time there isn't a valid free space cache
for that block group.
