fs: optimize out 16 bytes worth of padding in struct inode

Rearrange the fields in struct inode so that on an x86_64 system,
fields that require 8-byte alignment don't end up causing 4-byte holes
in the structure.  It reduces the size of struct inode from 568 bytes
to 552 bytes.

Also move the fields protected by i_lock (i_blocks, i_bytes, and
i_size) into the same cache line as i_lock.
