bna: Ethtool Enhancements and Fix

Change details:
 - Add tx_skb counters and NAPI debug counters to ethtool stats.
 - Add rlb stats strings to bnad_net_stats_strings{} array. rlb_stats field
   was added to struct bfi_enet_stats {} but the corresponding name structure
   array for ethtool was not initialized with right strings, even though the
   actual name structure array got expanded. This caused a NULL pointer
   violation and a crash when doing ehtool -S <if_name>.
 - Modify dim timer stop logic to make it dependent on cfg and run flags
 - While setting the ring parameter restore the rx, vlan configuration and
   set rx mode
 - Indentation fix
