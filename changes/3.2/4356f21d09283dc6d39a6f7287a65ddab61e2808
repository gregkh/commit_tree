mm: change isolate mode from #define to bitwise type

Change ISOLATE_XXX macro with bitwise isolate_mode_t type.  Normally,
macro isn't recommended as it's type-unsafe and making debugging harder as
symbol cannot be passed throught to the debugger.

Quote from Johannes
" Hmm, it would probably be cleaner to fully convert the isolation mode
into independent flags.  INACTIVE, ACTIVE, BOTH is currently a
tri-state among flags, which is a bit ugly."

This patch moves isolate mode from swap.h to mmzone.h by memcontrol.h
