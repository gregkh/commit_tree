HID: lg4ff - Add range setting support and sysfs interface

Wheel range of certain Logitech wheels - namely Driving Force GT, Driving Force
Pro, G25 and G27 can be adjusted. Minimu is 40 degrees, maximum 900. DFGT, G25
and G27 all use a common command, DFP uses another one.  Range can be set from
userspace by writing to
"/sys/module/hid_logitech/drivers/hid:logitech/<dev>range". The driver use list
to store range of each connected wheel; it's not possible to use driver_data in
hid_device struct as it's already b hig-lg driver.
