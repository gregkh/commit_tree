ath9k_hw: Fix magnitude/phase average in TxIQ Calibration

The commit "ath9k_hw: Fix Tx IQ Calibration hang issue in
AR9003 chips" did not consider more than one potential sample
while calculating magnitude/phase average if more than one
sample has the same value which could affect post-processing
of outlier detection that causes an undesirable Tx IQ
correction value will be assigned to tx gain settings where
outlier happens.
