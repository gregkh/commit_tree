btrfs: separate superblock items out of fs_info

fs_info has now ~9kb, more than fits into one page. This will cause
mount failure when memory is too fragmented. Top space consumers are
super block structures super_copy and super_for_commit, ~2.8kb each.
Allocate them dynamically. fs_info will be ~3.5kb. (measured on x86_64)

Add a wrapper for freeing fs_info and all of it's dynamically allocated
members.
