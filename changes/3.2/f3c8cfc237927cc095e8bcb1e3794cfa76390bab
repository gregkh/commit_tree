mtd: pxa3xx_nand: enable multiple chip select support

Current pxa3xx_nand controller has two chip select which
both be workable. This patch enable this feature.

Update platform driver to support this feature.

Another notice should be taken that:
When you want to use this feature, you should not enable the
keep configuration feature, for two chip select could be
attached with different nand chip. The different page size
and timing requirement make the keep configuration impossible.
