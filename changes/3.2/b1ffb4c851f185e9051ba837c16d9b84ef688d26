USB: Fix Corruption issue in USB ftdi driver ftdi_sio.c

Fix for ftdi_set_termios() glitching output

ftdi_set_termios() is constantly setting the baud rate, data bits and parity
unnecessarily on every call, . When called while characters are being
transmitted can cause the FTDI chip to corrupt the serial port bit stream
output by stalling the output half a bit during the output of a character.
Simple fix by skipping this setting if the baud rate/data bits/parity are
unchanged.

  I had a brief run with strace on the getty and it was doing ioctl()s on
  each call but it didn't look relavant to the problem. I think the issue is
  that XON/XOFF flow control was being implmented via hardware - for the ixoff
  to allow the user to use XON/XOFF to control output. Unfortunately it would
  send 3 Control URBs updating all of the settings after each piece of input

  I am trying to work around the issue of gmail messing with the tab/spacing
  by submitting via SMTP via gmail which I believe should fix the issue.

  The patch is against v3.2-rc2 and compiles - but no additional testing in
  this kernel has been done.

  Thanks
