tipc: Prevent fragmented messages during initial name table exchange

Reduces the maximum size of messages sent during the initial exchange
of name table information between two nodes to be no larger than the
MTU of the first link established between the nodes. This ensures that
messages will never need to be fragmented, which would add unnecessary
overhead to the name table synchronization mechanism.
