perf hists browser: Invalidate ui_browser->top after timer calls

With underlying dynamic data structures we need to invalidate pointers
to them after a timer, as that entry may have vanished (decayed in top,
for instance).

I forgot about browser_ui->top. Fix it by resetting it to null after a
timer. The seek operation from SEEK_SET will then set it to a valid
entry because it starts from rb_first(&hists->entries).
