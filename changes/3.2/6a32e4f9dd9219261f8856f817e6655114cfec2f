vlan: allow nested vlan_do_receive()

commit 2425717b27eb (net: allow vlan traffic to be received under bond)
broke ARP processing on vlan on top of bonding.

       +-------+
eth0 --| bond0 |---bond0.103
eth1 --|       |
       +-------+

52870.115436: kfree_skb <-arp_rcv

Packet is dropped in arp_rcv() because its pkt_type was set to
PACKET_OTHERHOST in the first vlan_do_receive() call, since no eth0.103
exists.

We really need to change pkt_type only if no more rx_handler is about to
be called for the packet.
