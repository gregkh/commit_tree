mac80211: Send nullfunc frames at lower rate during connection monitor

Recently mac80211 was changed to use nullfunc instead of probe
request for connection monitoring for tx ack status reporting
hardwares. Sometimes in congested network, STA got disconnected
quickly after the association. It was observered that the rate
control was not adopted to environment due to minimal transmission.

As the nullfunc are used for monitoring purpose, these frames should
not be sacrificed for rate control updation. So it is better to send
the monitoring null func frames at minimum rate that could help to
retain the connection.
