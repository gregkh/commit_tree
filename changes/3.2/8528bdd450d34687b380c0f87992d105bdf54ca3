regmap: Allow caches for devices with no defaults

We only really need the defaults in order to cut down the number of
registers we sync and to satisfy reads while the device is powered off
but not all devices are going to need to do that (always on devices like
PMICs being the prime example) so don't require those devices to supply
a default.  Instead only try to fall back to hardware defaults if the
driver told us to.

Devices using LZO won't be able to instantiate with this, that will require
some updates in the LZO code to handle this case.
