PCI: Add quirk for known incorrect MPSS

Using legacy interrupts and TLPs > 256 bytes on the SFC4000 (all
revisions) may cause interrupt messages to be replayed.  In some
systems this results in a non-recoverable MCE.  Early boards using the
SFC4000 set the maximum payload size supported (MPSS) to 1024 bytes
and we should override that.

There are probably other devices with similar issues, so give this
quirk a generic name.
