be2net: fix cmd-rx-filter not notifying MCC

Dave, I missed out on this line while composing the 4/6 patch from my
yesterday's patchset ("[PATCH net-next 4/6] be2net: use RX_FILTER cmd
to program multicast addresses"). As you've already queued up the
patchset for net-next, I'm sending the fix in a separate patch. Pls
apply.
