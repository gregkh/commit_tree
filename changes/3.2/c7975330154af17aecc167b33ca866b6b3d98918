mtd: abstract last MTD partition parser argument

Encapsulate last MTD partition parser argument into a separate
structure. Currently it holds only 'origin' field for RedBoot parser,
but will be extended in future to contain at least device_node for OF
devices.

Amended commentary to make kerneldoc happy
