Revert "NFS: Ensure that writeback_single_inode() calls write_inode() when syncing"

This reverts commit b80c3cb628f0ebc241b02e38dd028969fb8026a2.

The reverted commit was rendered obsolete by a VFS fix: commit
5547e8aac6f71505d621a612de2fca0dd988b439 (writeback: Update dirty flags in
two steps). We now no longer need to worry about writeback_single_inode()
missing our marking the inode for COMMIT in 'do_writepages()' call.

Reverting this patch, fixes a performance regression in which the inode
would continuously get queued to the dirty list, causing the writeback
code to unnecessarily try to send a COMMIT.
