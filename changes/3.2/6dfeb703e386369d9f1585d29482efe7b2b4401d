ALSA: hda - Fix invalid pin and GPIO for Apple laptops with CS codecs

The PCI SSID 8086:7270 is commonly used for multiple Apple machines,
thus we can't use it as identifier for a unique model.  Because of this
conflict, some machines show weird behavior.  For example, MacBook Air
shows Front and Surround speakers although only Surround works due to
the wrongly overridden pin-configuration for imac27.

This patch fixes two things:
- Stop the wrong pin-config override of imac27 by removing PCI SSID
  entry for avoiding the wrong mappings,
- Add the generic GPIO setup for Apple machines by checking the codec
  SSID vendor bits
