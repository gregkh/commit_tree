powerpc: Reserve iommu page 0

Some devices have a dma-window that starts at the address 0. This allows
DMA addresses to be mapped to this address and returned to drivers as a
valid DMA address. Some drivers may not behave well in this case, since
the address 0 is considered an error or not allocated.

The solution to avoid this kind of error from happening is reserve the
page addressed as 0 so it cannot be allocated for a DMA mapping.
