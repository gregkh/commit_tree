mmc: core: Add quirk for long data read time

Adds a quirk that sets the data read timeout to a fixed value instead
of relying on the information in the CSD. The timeout value chosen
is 300ms since that has proven enough for the problematic cards found,
but could be increased if other cards require this.

This patch also enables this quirk for certain Micron cards known to
have this problem.
