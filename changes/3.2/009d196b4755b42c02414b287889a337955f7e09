ASoC: twl6040: Simplify code in out_drv_event for pending work check

Instead of checking, if the work is pending, it is safer to cancel
the pending work, or wait till the scheduled work finishes.
This way we can avoid modifying the variables used by the work
function.
Since we know that no work is pending, we can remove the two additional
checks in POST_PMU, and PRE_PMD for non pending works.
