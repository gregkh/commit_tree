Btrfs: avoid unnecessary bitmap search for cluster setup

setup_cluster_no_bitmap() searches all the extents and bitmaps starting
from offset. Therefore if it returns -ENOSPC, all the bitmaps starting
from offset are in the bitmaps list, so it's sufficient to search from
this list in setup_cluser_bitmap().
