pci: add module.h to files implicitly relying on its presence.

These were getting module.h implicitly from device.h but we want
to clean that up, so we fix it here to avoid things like:

pci/slot.c: In function ‘pci_hp_create_module_link’:
pci/slot.c:383: error: ‘module_kset’ undeclared (first use in this function)

Similarly, rpadlpar_core.c is modular, so add module.h to its includes.
