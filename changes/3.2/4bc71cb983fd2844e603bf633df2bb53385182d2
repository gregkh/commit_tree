net: consolidate and fix ethtool_ops->get_settings calling

This patch does several things:
- introduces __ethtool_get_settings which is called from ethtool code and
  from drivers as well. Put ASSERT_RTNL there.
- dev_ethtool_get_settings() is replaced by __ethtool_get_settings()
- changes calling in drivers so rtnl locking is respected. In
  iboe_get_rate was previously ->get_settings() called unlocked. This
  fixes it. Also prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo() in af_packet.c had the same
  problem. Also fixed by calling __dev_get_by_index() instead of
  dev_get_by_index() and holding rtnl_lock for both calls.
- introduces rtnl_lock in bnx2fc_vport_create() and fcoe_vport_create()
  so bnx2fc_if_create() and fcoe_if_create() are called locked as they
  are from other places.
- use __ethtool_get_settings() in bonding code
