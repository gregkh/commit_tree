sysfs: Remove support for tagged directories with untagged members.

Now that /sys/class/net/bonding_masters is implemented as a tagged sysfs
file we can remove support for untagged files in tagged directories.

This change removes any ambiguity of what a NULL namespace value
means.  A NULL namespace parameter after this patch means
that we are talking about an untagged sysfs dirent.

This makes the sysfs code much less prone to mistakes when during
maintenance.
