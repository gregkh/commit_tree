ktest: Sort make_min_config configs by dependecies

The make_min_config test will turn off one config at a time and check
if the config boots or not, and if it does, it will remove that config
plus any config that depended on that config.

ktest already looks if a config has a dependency and will try the
dependency config first. But by sorting the configs and trying the
config with the most configs dependent on it, we can shrink the
minconfig faster.
