arch/tile: factor out <arch/opcode.h> header

The kernel code was using some <asm> headers that included a mix
of hardware-specific information (typically found in Tilera <arch>
headers) and structures, enums, and function declarations supporting
the disassembly function of the tile-desc.c sources.

This change refactors that code so that a hardware-specific, but
OS- and application-agnostic header, is created: <arch/opcode.h>.
This header is then exported to userspace along with the other
<arch> headers and can be used to build userspace code; in particular,
it is used by glibc as part of implementing the backtrace() function.

The new header, together with a header that specifically describes
the disassembly code (<asm/tile-desc.h> with _32 and _64 variants),
replaces the old <asm/opcode-tile*.h> and <asm/opcode_constants*.h>
headers.

As part of this change, we are also renaming the 32-bit constants
from TILE_xxx to TILEPRO_xxx to better reflect the fact that they
are specific to the TILEPro architecture, and not to TILE-Gx
and any successor "tile" architecture chips.
