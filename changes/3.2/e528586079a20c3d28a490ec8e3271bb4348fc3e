[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix for kdump failure

This patch fixes the Kdump failure reported by Redhat wich was caused by
be2iscsi resetting the Chip when be2iscsi detects it is in crashdump mode. If
be2net was loaded before be2iscsi then this leaves be2net driver hanging on to
resources that the chip stopped recognising after the reset.

This patch replaces  chip reset with Function reset so that only the
particular function and not the whole chip is affected
