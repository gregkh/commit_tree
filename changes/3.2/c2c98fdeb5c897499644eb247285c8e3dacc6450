mac80211: optimise station flags

The flaglock in struct sta_info has long been
something that I wanted to get rid of, this
finally does the conversion to atomic bitops.

The conversion itself is straight-forward in
most places, a few things needed to change a
bit since we can no longer use multiple bits
at the same time.

On x86-64, this is a fairly significant code
size reduction:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex
 427861	  23648	   1008	 452517	  6e7a5	before
 425383	  23648	    976	 450007	  6ddd7	after
