bridge: allow forwarding some link local frames

This is based on an earlier patch by Nick Carter with comments
by David Lamparter but with some refinements. Thanks for their patience
this is a confusing area with overlap of standards, user requirements,
and compatibility with earlier releases.

It adds a new sysfs attribute
   /sys/class/net/brX/bridge/group_fwd_mask
that controls forwarding of frames with address of: 01-80-C2-00-00-0X
The default setting has no forwarding to retain compatibility.

One change from earlier releases is that forwarding of group
addresses is not dependent on STP being enabled or disabled. This
choice was made based on interpretation of tie 802.1 standards.
I expect complaints will arise because of this, but better to follow
the standard than continue acting incorrectly by default.

The filtering mask is writeable, but only values that don't forward
known control frames are allowed. It intentionally blocks attempts
to filter control protocols. For example: writing a 8 allows
forwarding 802.1X PAE addresses which is the most common request.
