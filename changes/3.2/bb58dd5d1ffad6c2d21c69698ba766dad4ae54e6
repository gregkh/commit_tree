PM / Hibernate: Do not leak memory in error/test code paths

The hibernation core code forgets to release memory preallocated
for hibernation if there's an error in its early stages or if test
modes causing hibernation_snapshot() to return early are used.  This
causes the system to be hardly usable, because the amount of
preallocated memory is usually huge.  Fix this problem.
