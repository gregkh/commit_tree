tracing/filter: Use static allocation for filter predicates

Don't dynamically allocate filter_pred struct, use static memory.
This way we can get rid of the code managing the dynamic filter_pred
struct object.

The create_pred function integrates create_logical_pred function.
This way the static predicate memory is returned only from
one place.
