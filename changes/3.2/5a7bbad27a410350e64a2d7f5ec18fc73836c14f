block: remove support for bio remapping from ->make_request

There is very little benefit in allowing to let a ->make_request
instance update the bios device and sector and loop around it in
__generic_make_request when we can archive the same through calling
generic_make_request from the driver and letting the loop in
generic_make_request handle it.

Note that various drivers got the return value from ->make_request and
returned non-zero values for errors.
