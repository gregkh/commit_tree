mac80211: Don't use a buf_size=0 in ADDBA requests

According to 802.11-2007, 7.3.1.14 it is compliant to use a buf_size of
0 in ADDBA requests. But some devices (AVM Fritz Stick N) arn't able to
handle that correctly and will reply with an ADDBA reponse with a
buf_size of 0 which in turn will disallow BA sessions for these
devices.

To work around this problem, initialize hw.max_tx_aggregation_subframes
to the maximum AMPDU buffer size 0x40.

Using 0 as default for the bufsize was introduced in commit
5dd36bc933e8be84f8369ac64505a2938f9ce036 (mac80211: allow advertising
correct maximum aggregate size).
