target: Fix transport_cmd_finish_abort queue removal bug

This patch fixes a bug in LUN_RESET operation with transport_cmd_finish_abort()
where transport_remove_cmd_from_queue() was incorrectly being called, causing
descriptors with t_state == TRANSPORT_FREE_CMD_INTR to be incorrectly removed
from qobj->qobj_list during process context release.  This change ensures the
descriptor is only removed via transport_remove_cmd_from_queue() when doing a
direct release via transport_generic_remove().
