netem: dont call vfree() under spinlock and BH disabled

commit 6373a9a286 (netem: use vmalloc for distribution table) added a
regression, since vfree() is called while holding a spinlock and BH
being disabled.

Fix this by doing the pointers swap in critical section, and freeing
after spinlock release.

Also add __GFP_NOWARN to the kmalloc() try, since we fallback to
vmalloc().
