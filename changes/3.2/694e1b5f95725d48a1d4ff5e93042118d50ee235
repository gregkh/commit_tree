staging:iio:magnetometer:ak8975 convert to iio_chan_spec + cleanups.

iio_chan_spec conversion is straight forward.

Other changes:
* use i2c_smbus_write_byte_data in write_data
* c99 isms to setup various structures.
* move the comment about the scale factor and kill off trivial access func.
* make mode setting code use a bool rather than a ulong.

Ultimately I'd like to get rid of that mode bit entirely and handle it through
core pm routines, but have left it for now.
