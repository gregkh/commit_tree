dccp ccid-2: check Ack Ratio when reducing cwnd

This patch causes CCID-2 to check the Ack Ratio after reducing the congestion
window. If the Ack Ratio is greater than the congestion window, it is
reduced. This prevents timeouts caused by an Ack Ratio larger than the
congestion window.

In this situation, we choose to set the Ack Ratio to half the congestion window
(or one if that's zero) so that if we loose one ack we don't trigger a timeout.
