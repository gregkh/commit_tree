KVM: nVMX: Fix nested VMX TSC emulation

This patch fixes two corner cases in nested (L2) handling of TSC-related
issues:

1. Somewhat suprisingly, according to the Intel spec, if L1 allows WRMSR to
the TSC MSR without an exit, then this should set L1's TSC value itself - not
offset by vmcs12.TSC_OFFSET (like was wrongly done in the previous code).

2. Allow L1 to disable the TSC_OFFSETING control, and then correctly ignore
the vmcs12.TSC_OFFSET.
