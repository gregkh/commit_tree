mmc: core: ext_csd.raw_* used in comparison but never set

f39b2dd9d ("mmc: core: Bus width testing needs to handle suspend/resume")
added code to only compare read-only ext_csd fields in bus width testing
code, yet it's comparing some fields that are never set.

The affected fields are ext_csd.raw_erased_mem_count and
ext_csd.raw_partition_support.
