xfs: factor extent map manipulations out of xfs_bmapi

To further improve the readability of xfs_bmapi(), factor the pure
extent map manipulations out into separate functions. This removes
large blocks of logic from the xfs_bmapi() code loop and makes it
easier to see the operational logic flow for xfs_bmapi().
