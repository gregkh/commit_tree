powerpc/p3060qds: Add support for P3060QDS board

The P3060QDS is a Freescale reference board that hosts the six-core P3060 SOC.
The P3060 Processor combines six e500mc Power Architecture processor cores with
high-performance datapath acceleration architecture(DPAA), CoreNet fabric
infrastructure, as well as network and peripheral interfaces.
