ALSA: intel8x0: Improve comments for VM optimization

The recently merged 228cf79376f1 looks a bit hackish while it is not.
The change was quite simple. In a virtualized environment the
patch unhacks old kludge introduced for old broken AC97 hardware.

This patch adds proper comment to "unkludge" code.
