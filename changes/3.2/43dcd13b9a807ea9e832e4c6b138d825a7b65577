fbdev: fix parsing of standard timings

The standard timings parses uses 1:1 dimensions when the ratio in the
EDID data is 0. However, for EDID 1.3 and later the dimensions are 16:10
when the ratio is 0.

Pass the version and revision numbers to get_std_timing() which can then
make the right decision about dimensions.
