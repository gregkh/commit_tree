KVM: x86: Prevent starting PIT timers in the absence of irqchip support

User space may create the PIT and forgets about setting up the irqchips.
In that case, firing PIT IRQs will crash the host:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000128
IP: [<ffffffffa10f6280>] kvm_set_irq+0x30/0x170 [kvm]
...
Call Trace:
 [<ffffffffa11228c1>] pit_do_work+0x51/0xd0 [kvm]
 [<ffffffff81071431>] process_one_work+0x111/0x4d0
 [<ffffffff81071bb2>] worker_thread+0x152/0x340
 [<ffffffff81075c8e>] kthread+0x7e/0x90
 [<ffffffff815a4474>] kernel_thread_helper+0x4/0x10

Prevent this by checking the irqchip mode before starting a timer. We
can't deny creating the PIT if the irqchips aren't set up yet as
current user land expects this order to work.
