ALSA: hda - Fix a regression for DMA-position check with CA0110

The regression-fix in 3.1 for the check of DMA-position validity caused
yet another regression for CA0110.  As usual, this hardware seems working
only with LPIB properly.  Adding the appropriate driver-caps bit to force
LPIB fixes the problem.
