ath9k: fix checks for first subframe delimiter padding

The commit "ath9k_hw: Fix exceed transmission burst-time of 5GHz" added
a padding of 60 delimiters on the first subframe to work around an issue
on AR9380, but it lacked the checks to prevent it from being applied to
pre-AR9380, enterprise AR9380 or AR9580+
