target: Remove legacy + unused device active I/O shutdown code

This patch removes the legacy device active I/O shutdown code that was
originally called from transport_processing_thread() context during shutdown
including transport_processing_shutdown() and transport_release_all_cmds().

This is due to the fact that in modern configfs control plane code by the
time shutdown of an se_device instance in transport_processing_thread()
is allowed to occur via:

	rmdir /sys/kernel/config/target/core/$HBA/$DEV

all active I/O will already have been ceased while removing active configfs
fabric Port/LUN symlinks.  Eg: the removal of an active se_device is protected
by inter-module VFS references from active Port/LUN symlinks.

Two WARN_ON() checks have been added in their place before exiting
transport_processing_thread() to watch out for any leaked descriptors.
