perf stat: Suppress printing std-dev when its 0

For pretty output only (preserve column for cvs output), dont print
std-deviation when its 0.00.  Do this based upon value, instead of
checking for --no-aggr, since the stats could conceivably be computed
over the runs on each CPU, and theres no reason to preclude that.
