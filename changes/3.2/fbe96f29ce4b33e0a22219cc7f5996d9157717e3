perf tools: Make perf.data more self-descriptive (v8)

The goal of this patch is to include more information about the host
environment into the perf.data so it is more self-descriptive. Overtime,
profiles are captured on various machines and it becomes hard to track
what was recorded, on what machine and when.

This patch provides a way to solve this by extending the perf.data file
with basic information about the host machine. To add those extensions,
we leverage the feature bits capabilities of the perf.data format.  The
change is backward compatible with existing perf.data files.

We define the following useful new extensions:
 - HEADER_HOSTNAME: the hostname
 - HEADER_OSRELEASE: the kernel release number
 - HEADER_ARCH: the hw architecture
 - HEADER_CPUDESC: generic CPU description
 - HEADER_NRCPUS: number of online/avail cpus
 - HEADER_CMDLINE: perf command line
 - HEADER_VERSION: perf version
 - HEADER_TOPOLOGY: cpu topology
 - HEADER_EVENT_DESC: full event description (attrs)
 - HEADER_CPUID: easy-to-parse low level CPU identication

The small granularity for the entries is to make it easier to extend
without breaking backward compatiblity. Many entries are provided as
ASCII strings.

Perf report/script have been modified to print the basic information as
easy-to-parse ASCII strings. Extended information about CPU and NUMA
topology may be requested with the -I option.

Thanks to David Ahern for reviewing and testing the many versions of
this patch.
