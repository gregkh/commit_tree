fs/minix: Verify bitmap block counts before mounting

Newer versions of MINIX can create filesystems that allocate an extra
bitmap block.  Mounting of this succeeds, but doing a statfs call will
result in an oops in count_free because of a negative number being used
for the bh index.

Avoid this by verifying the number of allocated blocks at mount time,
erroring out if there are not enough and make statfs ignore the extras
if there are too many.
