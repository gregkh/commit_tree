[S390] hibernate: directly trigger subchannel evaluation

Using the generic css_schedule_eval to evaluate subchannels
while resuming from hibernation is very slow when used with
many devices. Provide a new evaluation trigger which exploits
css_sched_sch_todo and use this in the resume callback for
ccw devices.
