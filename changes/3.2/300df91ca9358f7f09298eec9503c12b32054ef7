rcu: Event-trace markers for computing RCU CPU utilization

This commit adds the trace_rcu_utilization() marker that is to be
used to allow postprocessing scripts compute RCU's CPU utilization,
give or take event-trace overhead.  Note that we do not include RCU's
dyntick-idle interface because event tracing requires RCU protection,
which is not available in dyntick-idle mode.
