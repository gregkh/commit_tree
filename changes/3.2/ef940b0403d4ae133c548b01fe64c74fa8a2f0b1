ALSA: hda - Allow patching with any vendor/subsystem ids

In the ugly real world, there area really broken devices that don't set
codec SSID correctly.  In such a case, the ID can be random, thus the
patching won't work reliably.

For applying the patch forcibly to such a device, the driver will skip
the vendor and/or subsystem ID checks when zero or a negative number is
given in [codec] section.
