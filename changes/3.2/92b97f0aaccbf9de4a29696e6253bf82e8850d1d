PM: add runtime PM support to core Primecell driver

Add runtime PM support to the core Primecell driver, following the PCI
model of how this is done.

Rather than having every driver fiddle about with enabling runtime PM,
that's dealt with in the core and instead, drivers just do a put() in
their probe and a balancing get() in their remove function to activate
runtime PM for the device.

As we're dealing with enabling runtime PM in the core, fix up spi-pl022
as it must not enable and disable runtime PM itself anymore.
