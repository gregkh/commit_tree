[SCSI] scsi: Added support for adapter and firmware reset

Added new sysfs attr 'host_reset' in scsi_sysfs.c to
perform adapter or firmware reset as suggested by
Mike Christie here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=127359347111167&w=2

user/application can write "adapter" or "firmware" on
this attr and it will call newly added function hook
in scsi_host_template to call LDD adapter or firmware
reset implementation.
