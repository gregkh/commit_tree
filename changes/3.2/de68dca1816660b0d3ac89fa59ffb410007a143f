inet: add a redirect generation id in inetpeer

Now inetpeer is the place where we cache redirect information for ipv4
destinations, we must be able to invalidate informations when a route is
added/removed on host.

As inetpeer is not yet namespace aware, this patch adds a shared
redirect_genid, and a per inetpeer redirect_genid. This might be changed
later if inetpeer becomes ns aware.

Cache information for one inerpeer is valid as long as its
redirect_genid has the same value than global redirect_genid.
