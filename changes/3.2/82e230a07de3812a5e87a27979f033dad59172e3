writeback: set max_pause to lowest value on zero bdi_dirty

Some trace shows lots of bdi_dirty=0 lines where it's actually some
small value if w/o the accounting errors in the per-cpu bdi stats.

In this case the max pause time should really be set to the smallest
(non-zero) value to avoid IO queue underrun and improve throughput.
