dccp ccid-2: use feature-negotiation to report Ack Ratio changes

This uses the new feature-negotiation framework to signal Ack Ratio changes,
as required by RFC 4341, sec. 6.1.2.

That raises some problems with CCID-2, which at the moment can not cope
gracefully with Ack Ratios > 1. Since these issues are not directly related
to feature negotiation, they are marked by a FIXME.
