ipv4: Save nexthop address of LSRR/SSRR option to IPCB.

We can not update iph->daddr in ip_options_rcv_srr(), It is too early.
When some exception ocurred later (eg. in ip_forward() when goto
sr_failed) we need the ip header be identical to the original one as
ICMP need it.

Add a field 'nexthop' in struct ip_options to save nexthop of LSRR
or SSRR option.
