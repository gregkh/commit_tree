ACPI / cpuidle: Remove acpi_idle_suspend (to fix suspend regression)

After commit e978aa7d7d57 ("cpuidle: Move dev->last_residency update to
driver enter routine; remove dev->last_state") setting acpi_idle_suspend
to 1 by acpi_processor_suspend() causes the ACPI cpuidle routines to
return error codes continuously, which in turn causes cpuidle to lock up
(hard).

However, acpi_idle_suspend doesn't appear to be useful for any
particular purpose (it's racy and doesn't really provide any real
protection), so it can be removed, which makes the problem go away.
