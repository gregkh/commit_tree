Btrfs: fix to search one more bitmap for cluster setup

Suppose there are two bitmaps [0, 256], [256, 512] and one extent
[100, 120] in the free space cache, and we want to setup a cluster
with offset=100, bytes=50.

In this case, there will be only one bitmap [256, 512] in the temporary
bitmaps list, and then setup_cluster_bitmap() won't search bitmap [0, 256].

The cause is, the list is constructed in setup_cluster_no_bitmap(),
and only bitmaps with bitmap_entry->offset >= offset will be added
into the list, and the very bitmap that convers offset has
bitmap_entry->offset <= offset.
