powerpc/powernv: Add RTC and NVRAM support plus RTAS fallbacks

Implements OPAL RTC and NVRAM support and wire all that up to
the powernv platform.

We use RTAS for RTC as a fallback if available. Using RTAS for nvram
is not supported yet, pending some rework/cleanup and generalization
of the pSeries & CHRP code. We also use RTAS fallbacks for power off
and reboot
