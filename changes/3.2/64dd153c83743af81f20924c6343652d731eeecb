GFS2: rewrite fallocate code to write blocks directly

GFS2's fallocate code currently goes through the page cache. Since it's only
writing to the end of the file or to holes in it, it doesn't need to, and it
was causing issues on low memory environments. This patch pulls in some of
Steve's block allocation work, and uses it to simply allocate the blocks for
the file, and zero them out at allocation time.  It provides a slight
performance increase, and it dramatically simplifies the code.
