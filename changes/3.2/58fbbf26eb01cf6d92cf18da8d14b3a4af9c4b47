KVM: APIC: avoid instruction emulation for EOI writes

Instruction emulation for EOI writes can be skipped, since sane
guest simply uses MOV instead of string operations. This is a nice
improvement when guest doesn't support x2apic or hyper-V EOI
support.

a single VM bandwidth is observed with ~8% bandwidth improvement
(7.4Gbps->8Gbps), by saving ~5% cycles from EOI emulation.
