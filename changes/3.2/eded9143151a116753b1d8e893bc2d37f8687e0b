ARM: mach-shmobile: AG5EVM GIC Sparse IRQ fix

Fix IRQ support on the AG5EVM board. The sh73a0 and the AG5EVM
board make use of the ARM GIC hardware block as main interrupt
controller. The following commit changed the default behaviour
for non-device tree platforms and broke AG5EVM irq support:

f37a53c ARM: gic: fix irq_alloc_descs handling for sparse irq

Without this fix the following warning triggers at boot:

With this fix applied interrupts work as expected.
