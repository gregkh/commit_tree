OMAP4: 4430SDP: Add picodlp support to board file

An on-board projector named picodlp is available for OMAP4430 SDP.

Entry for this picodlp as a panel is being added in dss_devices array to
the board file.  It needs 4 GPIO pins for interfacing with host
processor and these are defined and two of them are configured in board
file.  Two GPIOs power_on and display_select are configured here.
picodlp also needs an i2c client over i2c controller-2 at address 0x1b.
