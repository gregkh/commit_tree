drivers/video: fsl-diu-fb: only DIU modes 0 and 1 are supported

The Freescale DIU video controller supports five video "modes", but only
the first two are used by the driver.  The other three are special modes
that don't make sense for a framebuffer driver.  Therefore, there's no
point in keeping a global variable that indicates which mode we're
supposed to use.
