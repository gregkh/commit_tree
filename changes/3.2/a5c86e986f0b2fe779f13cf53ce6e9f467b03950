hugetlb: remove dummy definitions of HPAGE_MASK and HPAGE_SIZE

Dummy, non-zero definitions for HPAGE_MASK and HPAGE_SIZE were added in
51c6f666fceb ("mm: ZAP_BLOCK causes redundant work") to avoid a divide
by zero in generic kernel code.

That code has since been removed, but probably should never have been
added in the first place: we don't want HPAGE_SIZE to act like PAGE_SIZE
for code that is working with hugepages, for example, when the
dependency on CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE has not been fulfilled.

Because hugepage size can differ from architecture to architecture, each
is required to have their own definitions for both HPAGE_MASK and
HPAGE_SIZE.  This is always done in arch/*/include/asm/page.h.

So, just remove the dummy and dangerous definitions since they are no
longer needed and reveals the correct dependencies.  Tested on
architectures using the definitions with allyesconfig: x86 (even with
thp), hppa, mips, powerpc, s390, sh3, sh4, sparc, and sparc64, and with
defconfig on ia64.
