mmc: core: Fix deadlock when the CONFIG_MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME is not defined

mmc_suspend_host() tries to claim host during suspend
and release it only when the bus suspend operation is
compeleted. If CONFIG_MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME is defined and
the host is flagged as removable, mmc_suspend_host()
tries to remove the card. In this process, the file system
sync can get blocked trying to acquire host which is already
claimed by mmc_suspend_host() causing deadlock.

Fix this deadlock by releasing host before ->remove() is called.
