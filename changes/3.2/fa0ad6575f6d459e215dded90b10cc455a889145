kconfig: adapt update-po-config to new UML layout

Commit 5c48b108 ("um: take arch/um/sys-x86 to arch/x86/um") broke the
make target update-po-config, as its symlink trick (again) fails.
(Previous breakage was fixed with commit bdc69ca4 ("kconfig: change
update-po-config to reflect new layout of arch/um").)

The new UML layout allows to drop the symlick trick entirely. And if,
one day, another architecture supports UML too, that should now work
without again breaking this make target.
