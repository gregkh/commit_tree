ext4: ext4_rename should dirty dir_bh with the correct directory

When ext4_rename performs a directory rename (move), dir_bh is a
buffer that is modified to update the '..' link in the directory being
moved (old_inode).  However, ext4_handle_dirty_metadata is called with
the old parent directory inode (old_dir) and dir_bh, which is
incorrect because dir_bh does not belong to the parent inode.  Fix
this error.
