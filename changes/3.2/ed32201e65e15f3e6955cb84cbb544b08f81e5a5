xfs: Return -EIO when xfs_vn_getattr() failed

An attribute of inode can be fetched via xfs_vn_getattr() in XFS.
Currently it returns EIO, not negative value, when it failed.  As a
result, the system call returns not negative value even though an
error occured. The stat(2), ls and mv commands cannot handle this
error and do not work correctly.

This patch fixes this bug, and returns -EIO, not EIO when an error
is detected in xfs_vn_getattr().
