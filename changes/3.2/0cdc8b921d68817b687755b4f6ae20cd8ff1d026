ARM: switch from NO_MACH_MEMORY_H to NEED_MACH_MEMORY_H

Given that we want the default to not have any <mach/memory.h> and given
that there are now fewer cases where it is still provided than the cases
where it is not at this point, this makes sense to invert the logic and
just identify the exception cases.

The word "need" instead of "have" was chosen to construct the config
symbol so not to suggest that having a mach/memory.h file is actually
a feature that one should aim for.
