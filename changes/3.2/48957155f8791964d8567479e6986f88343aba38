ARM: perf: only register a CPU PMU when present

Currently, an "empty" struct pmu is registered as the CPU PMU,
regardless of whether there is a physical PMU. This burdens the
accessor functions with checks to see whether a PMU is actually
present.

This patch changes initialisation to register a PMU only if there is a
supported PMU present, and removes the checks that this change makes
redundant.
