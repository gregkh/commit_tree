[SCSI] zfcp: return early from slave_destroy if slave_alloc returned early

zfcp_scsi_slave_destroy erroneously always tried to finish its task
even if the corresponding previous zfcp_scsi_slave_alloc returned
early. This can lead to kernel page faults on accessing uninitialized
fields of struct zfcp_scsi_dev in zfcp_erp_lun_shutdown_wait. Take the
port field of the struct to determine if slave_alloc returned early.

This zfcp bug is exposed by 4e6c82b (in turn fixing f7c9c6b to be
compatible with 21208ae) which can call slave_destroy for a
corresponding previous slave_alloc that did not finish.

This patch is based on James Bottomley's fix suggestion in
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg55449.html.
