ehea: Remove sleep at .ndo_get_stats

Currently ehea ndo_get_stats can sleep in two places, in a hcall
and in a GFP_KERNEL alloc, which is not correct.
This patch creates a delayed workqueue that grabs the information each 1
sec from the hardware, and place it into the device structure, so that,
.ndo_get_stats quickly returns the device structure statistics block.
