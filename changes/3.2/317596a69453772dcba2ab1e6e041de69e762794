ASoC: twl6040: Earphone path correction

Fix the DAPM routing for the earphone path.
Convert the DAPM_SWITCH_E to DAPM_OUT_DRV_E, so we can have correct
power up, and down sequence for EP.
Introduce mute control (Earphone Playback Switch) for users to
enable/disable the EP path.
Note: the EP does not have it's own dedicated DAC. EP is connected to
HSL DAC.
