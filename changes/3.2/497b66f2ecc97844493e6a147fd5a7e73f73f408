slub: return object pointer from get_partial() / new_slab().

There is no need anymore to return the pointer to a slab page from get_partial()
since the page reference can be stored in the kmem_cache_cpu structures "page" field.

Return an object pointer instead.

That in turn allows a simplification of the spaghetti code in __slab_alloc().
