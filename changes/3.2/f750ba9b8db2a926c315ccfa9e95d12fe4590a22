arm/imx: fix imx6q mmc error when mounting rootfs

The following error is seen in some case when mounting rootfs from
SD/MMC cards.

  Waiting for root device /dev/mmcblk0p1...
  mmc1: host does not support reading read-only switch. assuming write-enable.
  mmc1: new high speed SDHC card at address b368
  mmcblk0: mmc1:b368 SDC   3.74 GiB
   mmcblk0: p1
  mmc1: Timeout waiting for hardware interrupt.
  mmcblk0: error -110 transferring data, sector 3678224, nr 40, cmd response 0x900, card status 0xc00

  Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk0p1, logical block 458754

This patch fixes the problem by lowering the usdhc clock and correcting
watermark configuration.
