ARM: OMAP2PLUS: DSS: Ensure DSS works correctly if display is enabled in bootloader

Resetting DISPC when a DISPC output is enabled causes the DSS to go into an
inconsistent state. Thus if the bootloader has enabled a display, the hwmod code
cannot reset the DISPC module just like that, but the outputs need to be
disabled first.

Add function dispc_disable_outputs() which disables all active overlay manager
and ensure all frame transfers are completed.

Modify omap_dss_reset() to call this function and clear DSS_CONTROL,
DSS_SDI_CONTROL and DSS_PLL_CONTROL so that DSS is in a clean state when the
DSS2 driver starts.

This resolves the hang issue(caused by a L3 error during boot) seen on the
beagle board C3, which has a factory bootloader that enables display. The issue
is resolved with this patch.

Thanks to Tomi and Sricharan for some additional testing.
