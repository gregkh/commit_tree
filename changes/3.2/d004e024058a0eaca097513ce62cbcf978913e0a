timekeeping: add arch_offset hook to ktime_get functions

ktime_get and ktime_get_ts were calling timekeeping_get_ns()
but later they were not calling arch_gettimeoffset() so architectures
using this mechanism returned 0 ns when calling these functions.

This happened for example when running Busybox's ping which calls
syscall(__NR_clock_gettime, CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ts) which eventually
calls ktime_get. As a result the returned ping travel time was zero.
