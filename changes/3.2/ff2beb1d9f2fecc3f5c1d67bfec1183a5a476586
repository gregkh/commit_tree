ARM: OMAP4: hsmmc: Fix Pbias configuration on regulator OFF

MMC1 data line IO's are powered down in before set regulator function.
IO's should not be powered ON when regulator is OFF.
Keep the IO's in power pown mode after regulator OFF otherwise VMODE_ERROR
interrupt is generated due to mismatch in input (regulator)
voltage and MMC IO drive voltage.
Delete incorrect comments which are not applicable for OMAP4.
