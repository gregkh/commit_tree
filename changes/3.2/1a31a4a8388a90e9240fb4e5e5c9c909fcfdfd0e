netfilter: ctnetlink: fix scheduling while atomic if helper is autoloaded

This patch fixes one scheduling while atomic error:

[  385.565186] ctnetlink v0.93: registering with nfnetlink.
[  385.565349] BUG: scheduling while atomic: lt-expect_creat/16163/0x00000200

It can be triggered with utils/expect_create included in
libnetfilter_conntrack if the FTP helper is not loaded.
