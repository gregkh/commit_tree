lguest: move process freezing before pending signals check

run_guest tries to freeze the current process after it has handled
pending interrupts and before it calls lguest_arch_run_guest.
This doesn't work nicely if the task has been killed while being frozen
and when we want to handle that signal as soon as possible.
Let's move try_to_freeze before we check for pending signal so that we
can get out of the loop as soon as possible.
