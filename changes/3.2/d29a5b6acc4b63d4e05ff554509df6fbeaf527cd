target: remove SCF_EMULATE_CDB_ASYNC

All ->execute_task instances now need to complete the I/O explicitly,
which can either happen synchronously or asynchronously.

Note that a lot of the CDB emulations appear to return success even if
some lowlevel operations failed.  Given that this is an existing issue
this patch doesn't change that fact.
