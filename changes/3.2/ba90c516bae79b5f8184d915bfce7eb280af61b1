ARM: 7197/1: errata: Remove SMP dependency for erratum 751472

Activation conditions for a workaround should not be encoded in the
workaround's direct dependencies if this makes otherwise reasonable
configuration choices impossible.

This patches uses the SMP/UP patching facilities instead to compile
out the workaround if the configuration means that it is definitely
not needed.

This means that configs for buggy silicon can simply select
ARM_ERRATA_751472, without preventing a UP kernel from being built
or duplicatiing knowledge about when to activate the workaround.
This seems the correct way to do things, because the erratum is a
property of the silicon, irrespective of what the kernel config
happens to be.
