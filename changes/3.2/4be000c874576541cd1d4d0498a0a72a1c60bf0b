igb: cleanup IVAR configuration

This change is meant to cleanup some of the IVAR register configuration.
igb_assign_vector had become pretty large with multiple copies of the same
general code for setting the IVAR. This change consolidates most of that
code by adding the igb_write_ivar function which allows us just to compute
the index and offset and then use that information to setup the IVAR.
