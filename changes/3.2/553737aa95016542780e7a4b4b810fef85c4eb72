NET: au1000_eth: Pass MACDMA address through platform resource info.

This patch removes the last hardcoded base address from the au1000_eth
driver.  The base address of the MACDMA unit was derived from the
platform device id; if someone registered the MACs in inverse order
both would not work.
So instead pass the base address of the DMA unit to the driver with
the other platform resource information.
