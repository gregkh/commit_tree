Bluetooth: bcm203x: Fix race condition on disconnect

When disconnecting a bcm203x device we kill and destroy the usb-urb, however,
there might still be a pending work-structure which resubmits the now invalid
urb. To avoid this race condition, we simply set a shutdown-flag and
synchronously kill the worker first.

This also adds a comment to all schedule_work()s, as it is really not clear
that they are used as replacement for short timers (which can be seen in the git
history).
