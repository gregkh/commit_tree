rcu: Drive configuration directly from SMP and PREEMPT

This commit eliminates the possibility of running TREE_PREEMPT_RCU
when SMP=n and of running TINY_RCU when PREEMPT=y.  People who really
want these combinations can hand-edit init/Kconfig, but eliminating
them as choices for production systems reduces the amount of testing
required.  It will also allow cutting out a few #ifdefs.

Note that running TREE_RCU and TINY_RCU on single-CPU systems using
SMP-built kernels is still supported.
