x86, nmi: Wire up NMI handlers to new routines

Just convert all the files that have an nmi handler to the new routines.
Most of it is straight forward conversion.  A couple of places needed some
tweaking like kgdb which separates the debug notifier from the nmi handler
and mce removes a call to notify_die.

[Thanks to Ying for finding out the history behind that mce call

And Boris responding that he would like to remove that call because of it

https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/9/21/163]

The things that get converted are the registeration/unregistration routines
and the nmi handler itself has its args changed along with code removal
to check which list it is on (most are on one NMI list except for kgdb
which has both an NMI routine and an NMI Unknown routine).
