tty/n_gsm: fix a bug in gsm_dlci_data_output (adaption = 2 case)

in adaption=2 case we should put 1 or 2 byte with modem status bits
at the beginning of a buffer pointed by "dp". n_gsm use 1 byte case,
so it allocate a buffer of len + 1 size. As result we should:
  * put 1 byte of modem status bits
  * increase data pointer
  * put "len" bytes of data
but actually we have:
  * increase first byte with the value of modem status bits
  * decrease "len"
  * put orig_len - 1 bytes of data starting from the buffer beggining
This is evidently wrong.
