md/raid5: ensure correct assessment of drives during degraded reshape.

While reshaping a degraded array (as when reshaping a RAID0 by first
converting it to a degraded RAID4) we currently get confused about
which devices are in_sync.  In most cases we get it right, but in the
region that is being reshaped we need to treat non-failed devices as
in-sync when we have the data but haven't actually written it out yet.
