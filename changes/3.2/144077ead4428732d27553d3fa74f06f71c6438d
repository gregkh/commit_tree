m68k: merge the mmu and non-mmu traps.c files

The code for handling traps in the non-mmu case is a subset of the mmu
enabled case. Merge the non-mmu traps_no.c code back to a single traps.c.
There is actually no code mmu specific here at all, and the processor
specific code (for the more complex 68020/68030/68040/68060) is already
proplerly conditionaly used.

The format of console exception dump is a little different, but I don't
think will cause any one problems, it is purely for debug purposes.
