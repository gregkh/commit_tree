powerpc/numa: Enable SD_WAKE_AFFINE in node definition

When chasing a performance issue on ppc64, I noticed tasks
communicating via a pipe would often end up on different nodes.

It turns out SD_WAKE_AFFINE is not set in our node defition. Commit
9fcd18c9e63e (sched: re-tune balancing) enabled SD_WAKE_AFFINE
in the node definition for x86 and we need a similar change for
ppc64.

I used lmbench lat_ctx and perf bench pipe to verify this fix. Each
benchmark was run 10 times and the average taken.

lmbench lat_ctx:

before:  66565 ops/sec
after:  204700 ops/sec

3.1x faster

perf bench pipe:

before: 5.6570 usecs
after:  1.3470 usecs

4.2x faster
