mm: vmalloc: check for page allocation failure before vmlist insertion

Commit f5252e00 ("mm: avoid null pointer access in vm_struct via
/proc/vmallocinfo") adds newly allocated vm_structs to the vmlist after
it is fully initialised.  Unfortunately, it did not check that
__vmalloc_area_node() successfully populated the area.  In the event of
allocation failure, the vmalloc area is freed but the pointer to freed
memory is inserted into the vmlist leading to a a crash later in
get_vmalloc_info().

This patch adds a check for ____vmalloc_area_node() failure within
__vmalloc_node_range.  It does not use "goto fail" as in the previous
error path as a warning was already displayed by __vmalloc_area_node()
before it called vfree in its failure path.

Credit goes to Luciano Chavez for doing all the real work of identifying
exactly where the problem was.
