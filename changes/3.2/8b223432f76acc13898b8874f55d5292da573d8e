m68k/mac: Fix mac_irq_pending() for PSC MACE and SCC

Add missing return statement. The docs say that the level 4 PSC IRQs
relate to MACE DMA and SCC. Since those drivers don't call
mac_irq_pending() this patch has no affect. But it should be fixed all the
same, since it can be useful for MACE debugging.
