ocfs2: Implement llseek()

ocfs2 implements its own llseek() to provide the SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA
functionality.

SEEK_HOLE sets the file pointer to the start of either a hole or an unwritten
(preallocated) extent, that is greater than or equal to the supplied offset.

SEEK_DATA sets the file pointer to the start of an allocated extent (not
unwritten) that is greater than or equal to the supplied offset.

If the supplied offset is on a desired region, then the file pointer is set
to it. Offsets greater than or equal to the file size return -ENXIO.

Unwritten (preallocated) extents are considered holes because the file system
treats reads to such regions in the same way as it does to holes.
