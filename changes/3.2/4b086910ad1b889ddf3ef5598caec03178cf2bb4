HID: MacbookAir4,1 and MacbookAir4,2 need entry in hid_mouse_ignore_list[]

The respective mouse devices are already supported by bcm5974. Now that
Nobuhiro Iwamatsu added support for keyboard to hid-apple driver, we need
to ignore the mouse interfaces of these so that they can still be properly
claimed by bcm5974 driver.
