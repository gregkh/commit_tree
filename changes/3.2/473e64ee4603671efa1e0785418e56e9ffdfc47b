ethtool: Update ethtool_rxnfc::rule_cnt on return from ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL

A user-space process must use ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLCNT to find the number
of classification rules, then allocate a buffer of the right size,
then use ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL to fill the buffer.  If some other
process inserts or deletes a rule between those two operations,
the user buffer might turn out to be the wrong size.

If it's too small, the return value will be -EMSGSIZE.  But if it's
too large, there is no indication of this.  Fix this by updating
the rule_cnt field on return.
