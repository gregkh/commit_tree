Btrfs: only reserve space in fallocate if we have to do a preallocate

Lukas found a problem where if he tries to fallocate over the same region twice
and the first fallocate took up all the space we would fail with ENOSPC.  This
is because we reserve the total space we want to use for fallocate, regardless
of wether or not we will have to actually preallocate.  So instead move the
check into the loop where we actually have to do the preallocate.  Thanks,
