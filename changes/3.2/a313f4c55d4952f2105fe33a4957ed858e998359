powerpc/signal32: Fix sigset_t conversion when copying to user

On PPC64, put_sigset_t converts a sigset_t to a compat_sigset_t
before copying it to userspace. There is a typo in the case that
we have 4 words to copy, meaning that we corrupt the compat_sigset_t.

It appears that _NSIG_WORDS can't be greater than 2 at the moment
so this code is probably always optimised away anyway.
