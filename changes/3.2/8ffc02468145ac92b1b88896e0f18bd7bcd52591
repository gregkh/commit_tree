drm/i915: Defend against userspace creating a gem object with size==0

We currently only round up the userspace size to the next page. We
assume that userspace hasn't made a mistake and requested a zero-length
gem object and all through our internal code we then presume that every
object is backed by at least a single page. Fix that oversight and
report EINVAL back to userspace if they try to create a zero length
object.
