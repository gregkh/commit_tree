rcu: Make rcu_torture_fqs() exit loops at end of test

The rcu_torture_fqs() function can prevent the rcutorture tests from
completing, resulting in a hang.  This commit therefore ensures that
rcu_torture_fqs() will exit its inner loops at the end of the test,
and also applies the newish ULONG_CMP_LT() macro to time comparisons.
