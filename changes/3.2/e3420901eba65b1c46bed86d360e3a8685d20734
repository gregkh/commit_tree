EHCI : Fix a regression in the ISO scheduler

Fix a regression that was introduced by commit
811c926c538f7e8d3c08b630dd5844efd7e000f6 (USB: EHCI: fix HUB TT scheduling
issue with iso transfer).

We detect an error if next == start, but this means uframe 0 can't be allocated
anymore for iso transfer...
