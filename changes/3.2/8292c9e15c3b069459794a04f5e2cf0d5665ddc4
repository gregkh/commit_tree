locking, semaphores: Annotate inner lock as raw

There is no reason to have the spin_lock protecting the semaphore
preemptible on -rt. Annotate it as a raw_spinlock.

In mainline this change documents the low level nature of
the lock - otherwise there's no functional difference. Lockdep
and Sparse checking will work as usual.

( On rt this also solves lockdep complaining about the
  rt_mutex.wait_lock being not initialized. )
