ARM: perf: clean up event group validation

Currently, event group validation compares each event's 'pmu' pointer
against the static 'pmu' pointer. This limits the code to supporting
only 1 PMU.

This patch changes the behaviour to consider an event's group leader's
'pmu' pointer as canonical for validation. This should ease later
generalisation of the code to support multiple PMUs at once.
