wl12xx: replace dummy_join with ROC/CROC commands

The ROC command asks the fw stay on the channel of the given
hlid. it currently has 2 primary functions:

1. Allow tx/rx from the device role.

In order to tx/rx packets while the stations is not associated
(e.g. auth req/resp), the device role has to be used, along
with ROC on its link.

Keep the logic similiar to the one used in dummy_join. However,
since we can't scan while we ROC, we add CROC before starting
a scan, and ROC again (if needed) on scan complete.

2. Keeping the antenna for a specific link.

We ROC until the connection was completed (after EAPOLs exchange)
in order to prevent BT coex operations from taking the antenna
and failing the connection (after this stage, psm can be used).

During association, we ROC on the station role, and then CROC
the device role, thus assuring being ROC during all the connection
process.

Delete the WL1271_FLAG_JOINED flag, and use a roc bitmap
to indicate what roles are currently ROCed.

Add wl12xx_roc/croc functions in order to wrap the roc/croc
commands while taking care of the roc bitmap.

The current ROC/CROC state-machine is a bit complicated. In
the future we'll probably want to use wpa_supplicant to control
the ROC during connection.
