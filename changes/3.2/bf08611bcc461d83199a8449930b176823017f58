[SCSI] lpfc 8.3.26: Fix issues pertaining to SCSI/FC protocol.

Fix issues pertaining to SCSI/FC protocol.

- Allow frames destined to 0xFFFFFE to be processed by the driver by matching
  that DID with the physical port.
- Call lpfc_sli_issue_iocb with context1 set to ndlp
- In echo command accept function, adjust memcpy to limit memcpy to 1K
- Set LPFC_SLI3_BG_ENABLED properly upon completion.
- Skip the INIT_VFI call in lpfc_register_fcf if the FCF is already
  registered and go immediately to initial flogi.
- use "status" variable instead of "ret" variable to hold the return of the
  fc_block_scsi_eh.
