serial: samsung: Add unified interrupt handler for s3c64xx and later SoC's

s3c64xx and later SoC's include the interrupt mask and pending registers
in the uart controller, unlike the s3c24xx SoC's which have these registers
in the interrupt controller. When the mask and pending registers are part
of the uart controller, a unified interrupt handler can handle the tx/rx
interrupt. With this, the static reservation of interrupt numbers for the
uart tx/rx/err interrupts in the linux irq space is not required and
simplifies adding device tree support.
