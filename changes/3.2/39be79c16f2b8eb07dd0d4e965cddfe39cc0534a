vfs: iov_iter: have iov_iter_advance decrement nr_segs appropriately

Currently, when you call iov_iter_advance, then the pointer to the iovec
array can be incremented, but it does not decrement the nr_segs value in
the iov_iter struct. The result is a iov_iter struct with a nr_segs
value that goes beyond the end of the array.

While I'm not aware of anything that's specifically broken by this, it
seems odd and a bit dangerous not to decrement that value. If someone
were to trust the nr_segs value to be correct, then they could end up
walking off the end of the array.

Changing this might also provide some micro-optimization when dealing
with the last iovec in an array. Many of the other routines that deal
with iov_iter have optimized codepaths when nr_segs == 1.
