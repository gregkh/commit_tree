net-netlink: Add a new attribute to expose TOS values via netlink

This patch exposes the tos value for the TCP sockets when the TOS flag
is requested in the ext_flags for the inet_diag request. This would mainly be
used to expose TOS values for both for TCP and UDP sockets. Currently it is
supported for TCP. When netlink support for UDP would be added the support
to expose the TOS values would alse be done. For IPV4 tos value is exposed
and for IPV6 tclass value is exposed.
