xen-gntalloc: integer overflow in gntalloc_ioctl_alloc()

On 32 bit systems a high value of op.count could lead to an integer
overflow in the kzalloc() and gref_ids would be smaller than
expected.  If the you triggered another integer overflow in
"if (gref_size + op.count > limit)" then you'd probably get memory
corruption inside add_grefs().
