[SCSI] fcoe: fix fcoe in a DCB environment by adding DCB notifiers to set skb priority

Use DCB notifiers to set the skb priority to allow packets
to be steered and tagged correctly over DCB enabled drivers
that setup traffic classes.

This allows queue_mapping() routines to be removed in these
drivers that were previously inspecting the ethertype of
every skb to mark FCoE/FIP frames.
