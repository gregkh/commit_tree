ARM: perf: use cpumask_t to record active IRQs

Commit 5dfc54e0 ("ARM: GIC: avoid routing interrupts to offline CPUs")
prevents the GIC from setting the affinity of an IRQ to a CPU with
id >= nr_cpu_ids. This was previously abused by perf on some platforms
where more IRQs were registered than possible CPUs.

This patch fixes the problem by using a cpumask_t to keep track of the
active (requested) interrupts in perf. The same effect could be achieved
by limiting the number of IRQs to the number of CPUs, but using a mask
instead will be useful for adding extended CPU hotplug support in the
future.
