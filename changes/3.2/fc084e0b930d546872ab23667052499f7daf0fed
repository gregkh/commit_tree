ALSA: sis7019 - give slow codecs more time to reset

There are some AC97 codec and board combinations that have been observed
to take a very long time to respond after the cold reset has completed.
In one case, more than 350 ms was required. To allow users to have sound
on those platforms, we'll wait up to 500ms for the codec to become
ready.

As a board may have multiple codecs, with some faster than others to
reset, we add a module parameter to inform the driver which codecs
should be present.
