perf: Fix counter of ftrace events

Each event adds some points to its counters. By default it adds 1,
and a number of points may be transmited in event's parameters.

E.g. sched:sched_stat_runtime adds how long process has been running.

But this functionality was broken by v2.6.31-rc5-392-gf413cdb
and now the event's parameters doesn't affect on a number of points.

TP_perf_assign isn't defined, so __perf_count(c) isn't executed and
__count is always equal to 1.
