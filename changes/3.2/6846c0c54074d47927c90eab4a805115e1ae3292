rcu: Improve rcu_assign_pointer() and RCU_INIT_POINTER() documentation

The differences between rcu_assign_pointer() and RCU_INIT_POINTER() are
subtle, and it is easy to use the the cheaper RCU_INIT_POINTER() when
the more-expensive rcu_assign_pointer() should have been used instead.
The consequences of this mistake are quite severe.

This commit therefore carefully lays out the situations in which it it
permissible to use RCU_INIT_POINTER().
