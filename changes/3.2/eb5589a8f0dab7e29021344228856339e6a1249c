include: convert various register fcns to macros to avoid include chaining

The original implementations reference THIS_MODULE in an inline.
We could include <linux/export.h>, but it is better to avoid chaining.

Fortunately someone else already thought of this, and made a similar
inline into a #define in <linux/device.h> for device_schedule_callback(),
[see commit 523ded71de0] so follow that precedent here.

Also bubble up any __must_check that were used on the prev. wrapper inline
functions up one to the real __register functions, to preserve any prev.
sanity checks that were used in those instances.
