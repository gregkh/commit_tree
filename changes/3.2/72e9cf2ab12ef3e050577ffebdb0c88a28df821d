xen/balloon: Avoid OOM when requesting highmem

If highmem pages are requested from the balloon on a system without
highmem, the implementation of alloc_xenballooned_pages will allocate
all available memory trying to find highmem pages to return. Allow
low memory to be returned when highmem pages are requested to avoid
this loop.
