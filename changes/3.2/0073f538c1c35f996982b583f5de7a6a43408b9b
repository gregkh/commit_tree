[CPUFREQ] ARM Exynos4210 PM/Suspend compatibility with different bootloaders

We have various bootloaders for Exynos4210 machines. Some of they
set the ARM core frequency at boot time even when the boot is a resume
from suspend-to-RAM. Such changes may create inconsistency in the
data of CPUFREQ driver and have incurred hang issues with suspend-to-RAM.

This patch enables to save and restore CPU frequencies with pm-notifier and
sets the frequency at the initial (boot-time) value so that there wouldn't
be any inconsistency between bootloader and kernel. This patch does not
use CPUFREQ's suspend/resume callbacks because they are syscore-ops, which
do not allow to use mutex that is being used by regulators that are used by
the target function.

This also prevents any CPUFREQ transitions during suspend-resume context,
which could be dangerous at noirq-context along with regulator framework.
