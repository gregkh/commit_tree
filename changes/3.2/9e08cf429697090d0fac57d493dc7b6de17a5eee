PM / Domains: Make pm_genpd_poweron() always survive parent removal

If pm_genpd_remove_subdomain() is called to remove a PM domain's
subdomain and pm_genpd_poweron() is called for that subdomain at
the same time, and the pm_genpd_poweron() called by it recursively
for the parent returns an error, the first pm_genpd_poweron()'s
error code path will attempt to decrement the subdomain counter of
a PM domain that it's not a subdomain of any more.

Rearrange the code in pm_genpd_poweron() to prevent this from
happening.
