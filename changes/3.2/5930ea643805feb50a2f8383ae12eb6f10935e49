ext4: call ext4_handle_dirty_metadata with correct inode in ext4_dx_add_entry

ext4_dx_add_entry manipulates bh2 and frames[0].bh, which are two buffer_heads
that point to directory blocks assigned to the directory inode.  However, the
function calls ext4_handle_dirty_metadata with the inode of the file that's
being added to the directory, not the directory inode itself.  Therefore,
correct the code to dirty the directory buffers with the directory inode, not
the file inode.
