RED is useful for high throughput routers, I doubt many linux machines
act as such devices.

I was considering adding Adaptative RED (Sally Floyd, Ramakrishna
Gummadi, Scott Shender), August 2001

In this version, maxp is dynamic (from 1% to 50%), and user only have to
setup min_th (target average queue size)
(max_th and wq (burst in linux RED) are automatically setup)

By the way it seems we have a small bug in red_change()

if (skb_queue_empty(&sch->q))
	red_end_of_idle_period(&q->parms);

First, if queue is empty, we should call
red_start_of_idle_period(&q->parms);

Second, since we dont use anymore sch->q, but q->qdisc, the test is
meaningless.

Oh well...

[PATCH] sch_red: fix red_change()

Now RED is classful, we must check q->qdisc->q.qlen, and if queue is empty,
we start an idle period, not end it.
