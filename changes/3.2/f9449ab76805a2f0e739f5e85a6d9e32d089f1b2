be2net: refactor VF setup/teardown code into be_vf_setup/clear()

Currently the code for VF setup/teardown done by a PF (if_create,
mac_add_config, link_status_query etc) is scattered; this patch
refactors this code into be_vf_setup() and be_vf_clear().  The
if_create/if_destroy/mac_addr_query cmds are now called after the MCCQ
is created; so these cmds are now modified to use the MCCQ instead of
MBOX.
