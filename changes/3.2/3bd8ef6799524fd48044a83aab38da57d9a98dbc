staging: brcm80211: restrict register access method for bcm47xx

The driver contained conditional code for resolving issue with
dma transaction reordering. This code was conditionalized using
__mips__ macro, but it actually is specific to bcm47xx chips.
This patch replaces it for the more speficic CONFIG_BCM47XX macro.

Tested on BCM63281.
