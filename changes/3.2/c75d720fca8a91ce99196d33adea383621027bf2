genirq: Fix irqfixup, irqpoll regression

commit d05c65fff0 ("genirq: spurious: Run only one poller at a time")
introduced a regression, leaving the boot options 'irqfixup' and
'irqpoll' non-functional. The patch placed tests in each function, to
exit if the function is already running. The test in 'misrouted_irq'
exited when it should have proceeded, effectively disabling
'misrouted_irq' and 'poll_spurious_irqs'.

The check for an already running poller needs to be "!= 1" not "== 1"
as "1" is the value when the first poller starts running.
