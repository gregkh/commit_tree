TTY: pty, release tty in all ptmx_open fail paths

Mistakenly, commit 64ba3dc3143d (tty: never hold BTM while getting
tty_mutex) switched one fail path in ptmx_open to not free the newly
allocated tty.

Fix that by jumping to the appropriate place. And rename the labels so
that it's clear what is going on there.
