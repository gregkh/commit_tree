ext4: convert block group-relative offsets to use clusters

Certain parts of the ext4 code base, primarily in mballoc.c, use a
block group number and offset from the beginning of the block group.
This offset is invariably used to index into the allocation bitmap, so
change the offset to be denominated in units of clusters.
