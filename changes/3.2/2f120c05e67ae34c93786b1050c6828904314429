Btrfs: only map pages if we know we need them when reading the space cache

People have been running into a warning when loading space cache because the
page is already mapped when trying to read in a bitmap.  The way we read in
entries and pages is kind of convoluted, so fix it so that io_ctl_read_entry
maps the entries if it needs to, and if it hits the end of the page it simply
unmaps the page.  That way we can unconditionally unmap the io_ctl before
reading in the bitmap and we should stop hitting these warnings.  Thanks,
