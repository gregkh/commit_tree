MIPS: Alchemy: abstract USB block control register access

Alchemy chips have one or more registers which control access
to the usb blocks as well as PHY configuration.  I don't want
the OHCI/EHCI glues to know about the different registers and bits;
new code hides the gory details of USB configuration from them.
