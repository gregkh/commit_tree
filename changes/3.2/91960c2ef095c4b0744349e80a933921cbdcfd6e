usb: gadget: file_storage: fix race on unloading

There is a race, reproduced rarely if you unload the module
when host finishes mass storage device initialization (reading
partition table and so on): fsg_unbind() code first closes
lun files then waits for worker thread to finish its work, as
the result the thread may operate on already closed device
with an oops and backtrace:

Change the order in unbind: wait for the thread first, then close
the files.
