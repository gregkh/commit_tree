jme: fix irq storm after suspend/resume

If the device is down during suspend/resume, interrupts are enabled
without a registered interrupt handler, causing a storm of
unhandled interrupts until the IRQ is disabled because "nobody
cared".

Instead, check that the device is up before touching it in the
suspend/resume code.
