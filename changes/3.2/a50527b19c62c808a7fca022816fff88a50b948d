fs: Make write(2) interruptible by a fatal signal

Currently write(2) to a file is not interruptible by any signal.
Sometimes this is desirable, e.g. when you want to quickly kill a
process hogging your disk. Also, with commit 499d05ecf990 ("mm: Make
task in balance_dirty_pages() killable"), it's necessary to abort the
current write accordingly to avoid it quickly dirtying lots more pages
at unthrottled rate.

This patch makes write interruptible by SIGKILL. We do not allow write
to be interruptible by any other signal because that has larger
potential of screwing some badly written applications.
