ALSA: hda - Rewrite ALC662 asus-mode* models with fixups

Re-implement the asus-mode[1-8] quirks with the pin-config tables.
They are provided in case where BIOS is broken on the device, so it's
not enabled in PCI SSID lookup table.  User needs to specify it via model
option explicitly if the driver doesn't work with the BIOS setup as is.
