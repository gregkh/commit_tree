iwlagn: move traffic_log back to upper layer

The traffic log debugfs handlers were mistakenly moved to the
transport layer because they print the pointers of the Tx / Rx
queues. The pointers of the queues can be fetched by another debugfs
handler.
So bring the traffic log back to the upper layer and remove the part
that reads the Tx / Rx queues' pointers.
