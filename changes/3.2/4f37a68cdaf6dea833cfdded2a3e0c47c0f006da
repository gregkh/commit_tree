s390: Use direct ktime path for s390 clockevent device

The clock comparator on s390 uses the same format as the TOD clock.
If the value in the clock comparator is smaller than the current TOD
value an interrupt is pending. Use the CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_KTIME feature
to get the unmodified ktime of the next clockevent expiration and
use it to program the clock comparator without querying the TOD clock.
