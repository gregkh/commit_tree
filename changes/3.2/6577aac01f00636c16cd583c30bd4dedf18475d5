nfsd4: fix failure to end nfsd4 grace period

Even if we fail to write a recovery record, we should still mark the
client as having acquired its first state.  Otherwise we leave 4.1
clients with indefinite ERR_GRACE returns.

However, an inability to write stable storage records may cause failures
of reboot recovery, and the problem should still be brought to the
server administrator's attention.

So, make sure the error is logged.

These errors shouldn't normally be triggered on a corectly functioning
server--this isn't a case where a misconfigured client could spam the
logs.
