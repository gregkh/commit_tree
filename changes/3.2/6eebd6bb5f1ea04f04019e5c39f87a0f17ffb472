drm: Fix lack of CRTC disable for drm_crtc_helper_set_config(.fb=NULL)

Disabling the CRTC by setting its framebuffer to NULL, as used by
drm_framebuffer_cleanup(), was failing to pass the current framebuffer
to the crtc_func->disable callback. This is because of the dance within
drm_crtc_helper_set_config to pass the new_fb (NULL in this case) to the
drm_crtc_helper_set_mode with the currently attached fb as a parameter.
drm_crtc_helper_set_mode treats this as a no-op and the encoder is still
enabled. And so the current fb is forgotten before the call to
drm_helper_disable_unused_functions.

This patch treats disabling the CRTC as a simple special case rather
than adding further complexity into the configuration logic.

This fixes a pin-leak of the fb bo on Xserver close.
