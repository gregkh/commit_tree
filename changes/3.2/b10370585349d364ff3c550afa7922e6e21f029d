xfs: unlock the inode before log force in xfs_fsync

Only read the LSN we need to push to with the ilock held, and then release
it before we do the log force to improve concurrency.

This also removes the only direct caller of _xfs_trans_commit, thus
allowing it to be merged into the plain xfs_trans_commit again.
