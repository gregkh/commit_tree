rcu: Wire up RCU_BOOST_PRIO for rcutree

RCU boost threads start life at RCU_BOOST_PRIO, while others remain
at RCU_KTHREAD_PRIO.  While here, change thread names to match other
kthreads, and adjust rcu_yield() to not override the priority set by
the user.  This last change sets the stage for runtime changes to
priority in the -rt tree.
