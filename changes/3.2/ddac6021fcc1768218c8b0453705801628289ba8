miscdevice.h: delete unnecessary inclusion of module.h

This file has a define MODULE_ALIAS_MISCDEV which in turn will
use the MODULE_ALIAS define, but only if the former is explicitly
used by modular device driver code (and such code should be
already including module.h).

Delete the include, since module.h is such a giant thing that we
don't want it implicitly sneaking into compiles where it isn't
specifically required.
