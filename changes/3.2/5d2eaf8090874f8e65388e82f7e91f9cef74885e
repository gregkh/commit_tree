pinctrl: Don't copy function name when requesting a pin

Instead, store a pointer to the currently assigned function.

This allows us to delete the mux_requested variable from pin_desc; a pin
is requested if its currently assigned function is non-NULL.

When a pin is requested as a GPIO rather than a regular function, the
assigned function name is dynamically constructed. In this case, we have
to kstrdup() the dynamically constructed name, so that mux_function doesn't
pointed at stack data. This requires pin_free to be told whether to free
the mux_function pointer or not.

This removes the hard-coded maximum function name length.
