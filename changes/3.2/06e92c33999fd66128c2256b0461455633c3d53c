r6040: invoke phy_{start,stop} when appropriate

Joe reported to me that right after a bring up of a r6040 interface
the ethtool output had no consistent output with respect to link duplex
and speed. Fix this by adding a missing phy_start call in r6040_up and
conversely a phy_stop call in r6040_down to properly initialize phy states.
