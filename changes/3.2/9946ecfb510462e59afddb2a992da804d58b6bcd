nl80211/cfg80211: Add extra IE configuration to AP mode setup

The NL80211_CMD_NEW_BEACON command is, in practice, requesting AP mode
operations to be started. Add new attributes to provide extra IEs
(e.g., WPS IE, P2P IE) for drivers that build Beacon, Probe Response,
and (Re)Association Response frames internally (likely in firmware).
