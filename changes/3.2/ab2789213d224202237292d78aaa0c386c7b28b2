       sched: Avoid SMT siblings in select_idle_sibling() if possible

stopped selecting an idle SMT sibling when there are no idle
cores in a single socket system.

Intent of the select_idle_sibling() was to fallback to an idle
SMT sibling, if it fails to identify an idle core. But this
fallback was not happening on systems where all the scheduler
domains had `SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES' flag set.

Fix it. Slightly bigger patch of cleaning all these goto's etc
is queued up for the next release.
