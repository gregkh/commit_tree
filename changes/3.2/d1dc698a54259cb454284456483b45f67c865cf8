ASoC: support sample sizes properly in the WM8776 codec driver

Use snd_pcm_format_width() to determine the sample size, instead of
checking specify sample formats and assuming that those are the only
valid format.

This change adds support for big-endian architectures (which use the _BE
formats) and the packed 24-bit format (SNDRV_PCM_FORMAT_S24_3xE).
