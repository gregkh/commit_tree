vgaarb: a NULL bridge is acceptable for root devices.

I assumed all PCI buses had a bridge, but playing with qemu recently, I
discovered vgaarb bug where it wasn't detecting both devices shared a bridge
at the root level.

Don't check for NULL, if two buses have a NULL bridge, assume they share the
root bus.
