[media] s5p-fimc: Convert to the new control framework

Convert the v4l controls code to use the new control framework.

fimc_ctrls_activate/deactivate functions are introduced for the
transparent DMA transfer mode (JPEG), where the rotation and flipping
controls are not supported.

The capture video node does not inherit sensors' controls when the
subdevs are configured by the user space (user_subdev_api == true).
However by default after the driver's initialization
the 'user-subdev_api' flag is false and any sensor controls will
also be available at the video node.

When the pipeline links are disconnected through the media device
the FIMC and any sensor inherited controls are destroyed and then
again created when the pipeline connection completes.
