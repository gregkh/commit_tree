mtd: replace DEBUG() with pr_debug()

Start moving away from the MTD_DEBUG_LEVEL messages. The dynamic
debugging feature is a generic kernel feature that provides more
flexibility.

(See Documentation/dynamic-debug-howto.txt)

Also fix some punctuation, indentation, and capitalization that went
along with the affected lines.
