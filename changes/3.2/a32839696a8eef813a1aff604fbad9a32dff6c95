viafb: correct sync polarity for OLPC DCON

While the OLPC display appears to be able to handle either positive
or negative sync, the Display Controller only recognises positive sync.

This brings viafb (for XO-1.5) in line with lxfb (for XO-1) and
fixes a recent regression where the XO-1.5 DCON could no longer be
frozen. Thanks to Florian Tobias Schandinat for helping identify
the fix.

Test case: from a vt,
	echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/dcon/freeze
should cause the current screen contents to freeze, rather than garbage being
displayed.
