ARM: mach-shmobile: Kota2 TPU LED platform data

This patch updates the Kota2 board support code to
use the recently merged TPU LED driver whenever
possible.

The sh73a0 SoC has 5 TPU hardware blocks each with
4 timer channels which in theory allows a total of
20 LEDs to be controlled by "leds-renesas-tpu"
driver instances. The Kota2 board has 4 LEDs connected
to GPIO pins that also come with TPU pin functions, so
this patch ties up these 4 LEDS and leaves the remaining
3 LEDS for the GPIO based LED driver.
