rcu: Move __rcu_read_unlock()'s barrier() within if-statement

We only need to constrain the compiler if we are actually exiting
the top-level RCU read-side critical section.  This commit therefore
moves the first barrier() cal in __rcu_read_unlock() to inside the
"if" statement, thus avoiding needless register flushes for inner
rcu_read_unlock() calls.
