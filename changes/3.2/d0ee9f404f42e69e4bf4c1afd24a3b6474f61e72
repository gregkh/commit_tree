ARM: limit CONFIG_HAVE_IDE to platforms that do

Support for IDE drivers should not be automatic, since most platforms
cannot actually support any IDE low-level drivers. This partly
reverts 2064c946e "ARM: always select HAVE_IDE" to set this symbol
only when either a PC-style bus (PCI, ISA, PCMCIA) is enabled or
a platform is used that is known to have an existing driver in
drivers/ide.

New platforms should not need this option and just use CONFIG_ATA
with drivers/ata/.
