target: Make TFO->check_stop_free return free status

This patch converts target_core_fabric_ops->check_stop_free() usage in
transport_cmd_check_stop() and associated fabric module usage to
return '1' when the passed se_cmd has been released directly within
->check_stop_free(), or return '0' when the passed se_cmd has not
been released.

This addresses an issue where transport_cmd_finish_abort() ->
transport_cmd_check_stop_to_fabric() was leaking descriptors during
LUN_RESET for modules using ->check_stop_free(), but not directly
releasing se_cmd in all cases.
