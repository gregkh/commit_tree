perf/x86: Enable raw event access to Intel offcore events

Now that the core offcore support is fixed up (thanks Stephane) and we
have sane generic events utilizing them, re-enable the raw access to
the feature as well.

Note that it doesn't matter if you use event 0x1b7 or 0x1bb to specify
an offcore event, either one works and neither guarantees you'll end
up on a particular offcore MSR.
