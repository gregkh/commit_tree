ARM: OMAP3+: dpll: use DPLLs recalc function instead of omap2_get_dpll_rate

This is a continuation of Mike Turquette's patch "OMAP3+: use
DPLL's round_rate when setting rate".

omap3_noncore_dpll_set_rate() and omap3_noncore_dpll_enable() call
omap2_get_dpll_rate() explicitly. It may be necessary for some
DPLLs to use a different function and so use the DPLLs recalc()
function pointer instead.

An example is the DPLL_ABE on OMAP4 which can have a 4X multiplier
in addition to the usual MN multipler and dividers and therefore
uses a different round_rate and recalc function.
