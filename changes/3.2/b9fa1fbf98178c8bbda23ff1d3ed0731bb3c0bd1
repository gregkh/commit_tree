bna: Eliminate Small Race Condition Window in RX Path

Change details:
 - In a continuous sequence of ifconfig up/down operations, there is a small
   window of race between bnad_set_rx_mode() and bnad_cleanup_rx() while the
   former tries to access rx_info->rx & the latter sets it to NULL. This race
   could lead to bna_rx_mode_set() being called with a NULL (rx_info->rx)
   pointer and a crash.
 - Hold bnad->bna_lock while setting / unsetting rx_info->rx in bnad_setup_rx()
   & bnad_cleanup_rx(), thereby eliminating the race described above.
