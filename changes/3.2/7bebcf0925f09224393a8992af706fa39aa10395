powerpc/numa: Disable NEWIDLE balancing at node level

On big POWER7 boxes we see large amounts of CPU time in system
processes like workqueue and watchdog kernel threads.

We currently rebalance the entire machine each time a task goes
idle and this is very expensive on large machines. Disable newidle
balancing at the node level and rely on the scheduler tick to
rebalance across nodes.
