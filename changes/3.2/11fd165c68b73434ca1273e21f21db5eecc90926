sunrpc: use better NUMA affinities

Use NUMA aware allocations to reduce latencies and increase throughput.

sunrpc kthreads can use kthread_create_on_node() if pool_mode is
"percpu" or "pernode", and svc_prepare_thread()/svc_init_buffer() can
also take into account NUMA node affinity for memory allocations.
