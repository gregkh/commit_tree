leases: fix write-open/read-lease race

In setlease, we use i_writecount to decide whether we can give out a
read lease.

In open, we break leases before incrementing i_writecount.

There is therefore a window between the break lease and the i_writecount
increment when setlease could add a new read lease.

This would leave us with a simultaneous write open and read lease, which
shouldn't happen.
