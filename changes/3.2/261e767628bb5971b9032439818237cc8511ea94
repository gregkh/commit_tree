smscufx: change edid data to u8 instead of char

Having "edid" as char caused a problem in ufx_read_edid() where we
compared "edid[i] != 0xFF".  Because of the type difference, the
condition was never true and the error checking failed.

Also I added a __user notation to silence a sparse complaint.
