ceph: fix iput race when queueing inode work

If we queue a work item that calls iput(), make sure we ihold() before
attempting to queue work. Otherwise our queued work might miraculously run
before we notice the queue_work() succeeded and call ihold(), allowing the
inode to be destroyed.

That is, instead of

	if (queue_work(...))
		ihold();

we need to do

	ihold();
	if (!queue_work(...))
		iput();
