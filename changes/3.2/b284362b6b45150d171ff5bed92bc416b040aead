ASoC: cs42l51: Fix off-by-one for reg_cache_size

Just checking the code in cs42l51_fill_cache():
The cache pointer points to codec->reg_cache + 1.
I think it is because CS42L51_FIRSTREG is 0x01,
so codec->reg_cache[0] is not used here.

Then we read CS42L51_NUMREGS bytes to cache.
So we need reg_cache_size to be CS42L51_NUMREGS + 1.
