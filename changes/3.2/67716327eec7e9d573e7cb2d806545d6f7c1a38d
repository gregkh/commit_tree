mmc: block: add eMMC hardware reset support

For cards that support hardware reset (just eMMC), try a reset and
retry before returning an I/O error.  However this is not done for
ECC errors and is never done twice for the same operation type
(READ, WRITE, DISCARD, SECURE DISCARD) until that type of operation
again succeeds.
