ASoC: sta32x: Write the register default value to cache for reserved registers

Chip documentation explicitly requires that the reset values
of reserved register bits are left untouched.

codec->hw_read is broken now.
Here we use below trick to avoid writing to reserved registers while resume.
Write the register default value to cache for reserved registers,
so the write to the these registers are suppressed by the cache
restore code when it skips writes of default registers.
