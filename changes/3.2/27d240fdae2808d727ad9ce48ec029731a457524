sky2: fix regression on Yukon Optima

Changes to support other Optima types, introduced an accidental
regression that caused 88E8059 to come up in 10Mbit/sec.

The Yukon Optima supports a reverse auto-negotiation feature that
was incorrectly setup, and not needed. The feature could be used to
allow wake-on-lan at higher speeds. But doing it correctly would require
other changes to initialization.
