block: refactor generic_make_request

Move all the checks performed on a bio into a new helper, and call it as
soon as bio is submitted even if it is a re-submission from ->make_request.

We explicitly mark the new helper as beeing non-inlined as the stack
usage for printing the block device name in the failure case is quite
high and this a patch where we have to be extremely conservative about
stack usage.
