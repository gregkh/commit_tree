ASoC: soc-io: Fix CONFIG_REGMAP_I2C/SPI guards to support regmap modules

When CONFIG_REGMAP_I2C/SPI are m, CONFIG_REGMAP_I2C_MODULE is set in the
pre-processor instead of CONFIG_REGMAP_I2C. This removes SND_SOC_I2C as a
valid option for snd_soc_codec_set_cache_io()'s control parameter, and
causes any ASoC regmap-using codec built as a module to fail to initialize.
