[media] STV0288 frontend provide wider carrier search and DVB-S2 drop out. resend

The following patch provides wider carrier search.

As with existing code search starts at MSB aligned. The boundary
is widened to start at -9.  In order to save time, if no carrier is
detected at the start it advances to the next alignment until carrier
is found.

The stv0288 will detect a DVB-S2 carrier on all steps , a
time out of 11 steps is introduced to drop out of the loop.

In stv0288_set_symbol carrier and timing loops are restored to
default values (inittab) before setting the symbol rate on each tune. A
slight drift was noticed with full scan in the higher IF frequencies of
each band.
