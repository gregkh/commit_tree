ASoC: Suppress early calls to snd_soc_dapm_sync()

Ensure we only have one sync during the initial startup of the card by
making snd_soc_dapm_sync() a noop on non-instantiated cards. This avoids
any bounces due to things like jacks reporting their initial state on
partially initialised cards. The callers that don't also get called at
runtime should just be removed.
