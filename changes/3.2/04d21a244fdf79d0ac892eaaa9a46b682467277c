Btrfs: rework error handling in btrfs_mount()

Commits 6c41761f and 45ea6095 introduced the possibility of NULL pointer
dereference on error paths, also we would leave all devices busy and
leak fs_info with all sub-structures on error when trying to mount an
already mounted fs to a different directory.

Fix this by doing all allocations before trying to open any of the
devices, adjust error path for mount-already-mounted-fs case.
