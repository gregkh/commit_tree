rcu: Simplify unboosting checks

Commit 7765be (Fix RCU_BOOST race handling current->rcu_read_unlock_special)
introduced a new ->rcu_boosted field in the task structure.  This is
redundant because the existing ->rcu_boost_mutex will be non-NULL at
any time that ->rcu_boosted is nonzero.  Therefore, this commit removes
->rcu_boosted and tests ->rcu_boost_mutex instead.
