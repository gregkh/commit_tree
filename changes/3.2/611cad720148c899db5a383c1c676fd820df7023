dt: add of_alias_scan and of_alias_get_id

The patch adds function of_alias_scan to populate a global lookup
table with the properties of 'aliases' node and function
of_alias_get_id for drivers to find alias id from the lookup table.

v3: Split out automatic addition of aliases on id lookup so that it can be
    debated separately from the core functionality.
v2: - Add of_chosen/of_aliases populating and of_alias_scan() invocation
    for OF_PROMTREE.
    - Add locking
    - rework parse loop
