[media] staging: as102: Initial import from Abilis

Changes by Devin Heitmueller:

Import the original Abilis Systems as102 driver.  The source is unmodified,
with the only changes I've made so far were that I created a Kconfig and
Makefile so that the code builds in a standard v4l-dvb tree.

This driver requires firmware (which Abilis has provided with redistribution
terms which will allow it to be bundled in the Linux distributions).   The
firmware can be downloaded from here:

Thanks to Rainer Miethling from PCTV Systems for working to get the driver
released (for use with the PCTV 74e) and Pierrick Hascoet from Abilis for
authoring the driver.

Changes by Piotr Chmura:
 - moved the driver from media/dvb to staging/media
 - removed Makefile/Kconfig - compilation fails in current tree
