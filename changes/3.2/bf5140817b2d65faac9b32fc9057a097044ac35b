mtd: mtdchar: add missing initializer on raw write

On writes in MODE_RAW the mtd_oob_ops struct is not sufficiently
initialized which may cause nandwrite to fail. With this patch
it is possible to write raw nand/oob data without additional ECC
(either for testing or when some sectors need different oob layout
e.g. bootloader) like
nandwrite  -n -r -o  /dev/mtd0 <myfile>
