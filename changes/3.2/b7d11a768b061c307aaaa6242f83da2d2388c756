x86: cache_info: Kill the moronic shadow struct

Commit f9b90566c ("x86: reduce stack usage in init_intel_cacheinfo")
introduced a shadow structure to reduce the stack usage on large
machines instead of making the smaller structure embedded into the
large one. That's definitely a candidate for the bad taste award.

Move the small struct into the large one and get rid of the ugly type
casts.
