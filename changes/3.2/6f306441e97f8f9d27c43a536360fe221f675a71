regmap: Add support for device specific write and read flag masks.

Some buses like SPI have no standard notation of read or write operations.
The general scheme here is to set or clear specific bits in the register
address to indicate whether the operation is a read or write. We already
support having a read flag mask per bus, but as there is no standard
the bits which need to be set or cleared differ between devices and vendors,
thus we need a mechanism to specify them per device.

This patch adds two new entries to the regmap_config struct, read_flag_mask and
write_flag_mask. These will be or'ed onto the top byte when doing a read or
write operation. If both masks are empty the device will fallback to the
regmap_bus masks.
