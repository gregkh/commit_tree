mac80211: stop tx before doing hw config and rate update

The assumption is that during the hw config, transmission was
already stopped by mac80211. Sometimes the AP can be switching
b/w the ht modes due to intolerant or etc where STA is in
the middle of transmission. In such scenario, buffer overflow
was observed at driver side. And also before updating the rate
control, the frames are continued to xmited with older rates.
This patch ensures that the frames are always xmitted with
updated rates and avoid buffer overflow.
