ARM: gic, local timers: use the request_percpu_irq() interface

This patch remove the hardcoded link between local timers and PPIs,
and convert the PPI users (TWD, MCT and MSM timers) to the new
*_percpu_irq interface. Also some collateral cleanup
(local_timer_ack() is gone, and the interrupt handler is strictly
private to each driver).

PPIs are now useable for more than just the local timers.

Additional testing by David Brown (msm8250 and msm8660) and
Shawn Guo (imx6q).
