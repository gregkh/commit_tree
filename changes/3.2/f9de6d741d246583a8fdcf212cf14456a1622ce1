ASoC: Move bias level decision into main dapm_power_widgets()

Future patches will try to reduce the number of widgets we check on each
DAPM run but we're still going to need to look and see if the devices is
on at all so we can manage the overall device bias. Move these checks out
into the main dapm_power_widgets() function so we don't have to think about
them for now.

Once we're doing more incremental updates it'll probably be worth using
refcounts for each bias level to avoid having to do the sweep over all
widgets but that's not going to be where the big performance wins are.
