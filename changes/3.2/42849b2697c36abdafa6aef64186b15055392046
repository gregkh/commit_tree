RDMA/uverbs: Export ib_open_qp() capability to user space

Allow processes that share the same XRC domain to open an existing
shareable QP.  This permits those processes to receive events on the
shared QP and transfer ownership, so that any process may modify the
QP.  The latter allows the creating process to exit, while a remaining
process can still transition it for path migration purposes.
