iommu/core: let drivers know if an iommu fault handler isn't installed

Make report_iommu_fault() return -ENOSYS whenever an iommu fault
handler isn't installed, so IOMMU drivers can then do their own
platform-specific default behavior if they wanted.

Fault handlers can still return -ENOSYS in case they want to elicit the
default behavior of the IOMMU drivers.
