cifs: fix bad buffer length check in coalesce_t2

The current check looks to see if the RFC1002 length is larger than
CIFSMaxBufSize, and fails if it is. The buffer is actually larger than
that by MAX_CIFS_HDR_SIZE.

This bug has been around for a long time, but the fact that we used to
cap the clients MaxBufferSize at the same level as the server tended
to paper over it. Commit c974befa changed that however and caused this
bug to bite in more cases.
