m68k: move hardware vector setting from traps.c to its own file

Most of the trap.c code is general to all m68k arch members. But the code
it currently contains to set the hardware vector table is quite specific to
the 680x0 family. They can have the vector table at any address unlike
other family members (which either support only a single fixed address,
or a limited range of addresses). So lets move that code out to a new file,
vectors.c. This will make sharing the rest of the trap.c code easier and
cleaner.
