ixgbe: Always tag VLAN tagged packets

This change is meant to fix the patch:
	ixgbe: Cleanup FCOE and VLAN handling in xmit_frame_ring
And can be rolled into it if needed.

What this fixes is that VLAN tagged packets were not being tagged if they
were prio 7 which matches up with TC_PRIO_CONTROL.  In order to fix it I am
just setting things up so that we always tag VLAN tagged packets.
