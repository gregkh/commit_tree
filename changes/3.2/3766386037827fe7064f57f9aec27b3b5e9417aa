MIPS: Alchemy: remove all CONFIG_SOC_AU1??? defines

Now that no driver any longer depends on the CONFIG_SOC_AU1???  symbols,
it's time to get rid of them: Move some of the platform devices to the
boards which can use them, Rename a few (unused) constants in the header,
Replace them with MIPS_ALCHEMY in the various Kconfig files.  Finally
delete them altogether from the Alchemy Kconfig file.
