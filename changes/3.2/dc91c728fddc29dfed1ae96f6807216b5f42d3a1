xen: allow extra memory to be in multiple regions

Allow the extra memory (used by the balloon driver) to be in multiple
regions (typically two regions, one for low memory and one for high
memory).  This allows the balloon driver to increase the number of
available low pages (if the initial number if pages is small).

As a side effect, the algorithm for building the e820 memory map is
simpler and more obviously correct as the map supplied by the
hypervisor is (almost) used as is (in particular, all reserved regions
and gaps are preserved).  Only RAM regions are altered and RAM regions
above max_pfn + extra_pages are marked as unused (the region is split
in two if necessary).
