staging: xgifb: fix LVDS LCD resolution data setup

If the driver fails to get LVDS LCD data from the firmware, it falls
back to using driver's hardcoded values. However, this is done too
early in the probe. The selected video mode index is not yet known,
and also in some cases it could be defaulting to -1 resulting in a read
outside the array. Fix this by moving the array lookup after the video
mode validation.
