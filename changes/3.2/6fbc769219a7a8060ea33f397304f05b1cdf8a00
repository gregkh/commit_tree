[SCSI] pm8001: missing break statements

Code Inspection: found two missing break directives. First one will
result in not retrying an a task that report
IO_OPEN_CNX_ERROR_HW_RESOURCE_BUSY, the second will result in cosmetic
debug printk conflicting statement stutter. Because checkpatch.pl came
up with a warning regarding unnecessary space before a newline on one of
the fragments associated with the diff context, I took the liberty of
fixing all the cases of this issue in the pair of files touched by this
defect. These cosmetic changes hide the break changes :-(

To help focus, break changes are in pm8001_hwi.c fragment line 1649 for
the IO_OPEN_CNX_ERROR_HW_RESOURCE_BUSY case statement and pm8001_sas.c
line 1000 deals with the conflicting debug print stutter.
