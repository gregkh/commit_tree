ALSA: hda - Allow different assoc numbers for multiple speakers

In snd_hda_parse_pin_def_config(), we checked the associated number
of speaker pins and accepts only one number exclusively.  But many BIOS
seem to give different assoc number for surround speakers, thus we'd
better to accept all speaker pins no matter which assoc number, and sort
like done for the headphone pins.
