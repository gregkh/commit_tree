powerpc/p3060qds: Fix select of 'MPC8xxx_GPIO'

The driver for the Freescale P3060 QDS got added by commit 96cc017c5b
("[...] Add support for P3060QDS board"). Its Kconfig entry selects
MPC8xxx_GPIO. But at the time that driver got added MPC8xxx_GPIO was
already renamed to GPIO_MPC8XXX, by commit c68308dd50c ("gpio: move
mpc8xxx/512x gpio driver to drivers/gpio").

So make this driver select GPIO_MPC8XXX.
