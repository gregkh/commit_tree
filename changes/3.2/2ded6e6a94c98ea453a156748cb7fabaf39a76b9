x86, hpet: Immediately disable HPET timer 1 if rtc irq is masked

When HPET is operating in RTC mode, the TN_ENABLE bit on timer1
controls whether the HPET or the RTC delivers interrupts to irq8. When
the system goes into suspend, the RTC driver sends a signal to the
HPET driver so that the HPET releases control of irq8, allowing the
RTC to wake the system from suspend. The switchover is accomplished by
a write to the HPET configuration registers which currently only
occurs while servicing the HPET interrupt.

On some systems, I have seen the system suspend before an HPET
interrupt occurs, preventing the write to the HPET configuration
register and leaving the HPET in control of the irq8. As the HPET is
not active during suspend, it does not generate a wake signal and RTC
alarms do not work.

This patch forces the HPET driver to immediately transfer control of
the irq8 channel to the RTC instead of waiting until the next
interrupt event.
