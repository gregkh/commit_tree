tty: serial8250: add helpers for the DesignWare 8250

The Synopsys DesignWare 8250 is an 8250 that has an extra interrupt that
gets raised when writing to the LCR when busy.  To handle this we need
special serial_out, serial_in and handle_irq methods.  Add a new
function serial8250_use_designware_io() that configures a uart_port with
these accessors.
