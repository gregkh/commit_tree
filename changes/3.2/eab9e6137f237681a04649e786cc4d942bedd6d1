x86-64: Fix CFI data for interrupt frames

The patch titled "x86: Don't use frame pointer to save old stack
on irq entry" did not properly adjust CFI directives, so this
patch is a follow-up to that one.

With the old stack pointer no longer stored in a callee-saved
register (plus some offset), we now have to use a CFA expression
to describe the memory location where it is being found. This
requires the use of .cfi_escape (allowing arbitrary byte streams
to be emitted into .eh_frame), as there is no
.cfi_def_cfa_expression (which also cannot reasonably be
expected, as it would require a full expression parser).
