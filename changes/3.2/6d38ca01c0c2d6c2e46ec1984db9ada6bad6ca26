evm: evm_verify_hmac must not return INTEGRITY_UNKNOWN

If EVM is not supported or enabled, evm_verify_hmac() returns
INTEGRITY_UNKNOWN, which ima_appraise_measurement() ignores and sets
the appraisal status based solely on the security.ima verification.

evm_verify_hmac() also returns INTEGRITY_UNKNOWN for other failures, such
as temporary failures like -ENOMEM, resulting in possible attack vectors.
This patch changes the default return code for temporary/unexpected
failures, like -ENOMEM, from INTEGRITY_UNKNOWN to INTEGRITY_FAIL, making
evm_verify_hmac() fail safe.

As a result, failures need to be re-evaluated in order to catch both
temporary errors, such as the -ENOMEM, as well as errors that have been
resolved in fix mode.
