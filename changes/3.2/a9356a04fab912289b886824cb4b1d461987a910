ARM: perf: move platform device to struct arm_pmu

Currently the ARM perf code supports having a single struct
platform_device to supply IRQ numbers, limiting it to supporting a
single PMU.

This patch makes a platform_device instance variable on struct arm_pmu.
This should allow for multiple PMUs to be supported in future.
