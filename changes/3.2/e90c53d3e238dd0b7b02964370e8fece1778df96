rcu: Remove rcu_needs_cpu_flush() to avoid false quiescent states

The purpose of rcu_needs_cpu_flush() was to iterate on pushing the
current grace period in order to help the current CPU enter dyntick-idle
mode.  However, this can result in failures if the CPU starts entering
dyntick-idle mode, but then backs out.  In this case, the call to
rcu_pending() from rcu_needs_cpu_flush() might end up announcing a
non-existing quiescent state.

This commit therefore removes rcu_needs_cpu_flush() in favor of letting
the dyntick-idle machinery at the end of the softirq handler push the
loop along via its call to rcu_pending().
