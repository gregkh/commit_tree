ARM: perf: remove unnecessary armpmu->stop

As armpmu_disable will call armpmu->stop when the last event has been
removed, this is pointless and simply adds to the noise when debugging.
Additionally, due to this call occurring in a preemptible context, this
is problematic for per-cpu locking of PMU registers (where we will
attempt to access per-cpu spinlock for use with raw_spin_lock_irqsave).

This patch removes the call to armpmu->stop.
