MII: fix Kconfig dependencies for MII

MII Kconfig option is apart of the core networking drivers and
by default NET_CORE is enabled so drivers selecting MII will
have MII enabled as well.  It was found using the randconfig
option during testing, MII would be selected but NET_CORE
could be disabled.  This caused a dependency error.

Resolved the dependency by selecting NET_CORE when MII is
selected.
