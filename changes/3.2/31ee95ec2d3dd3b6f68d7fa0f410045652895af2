[media] adp1653: check error code of adp1653_init_controls

Potentially the adp1653_init_controls could return an error. In our case the
error was ignored, meanwhile it means incorrect initialization of V4L2
controls. Additionally we have to free control handler structures in case of
apd1653_init_controls or media_entity_init failure.
