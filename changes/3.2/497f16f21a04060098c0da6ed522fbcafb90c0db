pci: Fix hotplug of Express Module with pci bridges

I noticed that hotplug of one setup does not work with recent change in
pci tree.

After checking the bridge conf setup, I noticed that the bridges get
assigned but do not get enabled.

The reason is the following commit, while simply ignores bridge
resources when enabling a pci device:

|    PCI: defer enablement of SRIOV BARS
|...
|    NOTE: Note, there is subtle change in the pci_enable_device() API.  Any
|    driver that depends on SRIOV BARS to be enabled in pci_enable_device()
|    can fail.

Put back bridge resource and ROM resource checking to fix the problem.

That should fix regression like BIOS does not assign correct resource to
bridge.
