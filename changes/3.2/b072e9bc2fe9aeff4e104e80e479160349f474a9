KEYS: Make the key reaper non-reentrant

Make the key reaper non-reentrant by sticking it on the appropriate system work
queue when we queue it.  This will allow it to have global state and drop
locks.  It should probably be non-reentrant already as it may spend a long time
holding the key serial spinlock, and so multiple entrants can spend long
periods of time just sitting there spinning, waiting to get the lock.
