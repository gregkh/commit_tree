dmaengine/amba-pl08x: Pass flow controller information with slave channel data

At least, on SPEAr platforms there is one peripheral, JPEG, which can be flow
controller for DMA transfer. Currently DMA controller driver didn't support
peripheral flow controller configurations.

This patch adds device_fc field in struct pl08x_channel_data, which will be used
only for slave transfers and is not used in case of mem2mem transfers.
