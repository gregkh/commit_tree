[SCSI] isci: Handle task request timeouts correctly.

In the case where "task" requests timeout (note that this class of
requests can also include SATA/STP soft reset FIS transmissions),
handle the case where the task was being managed by some call to
terminate the task request by completing both the tmf and the aborting
process.
