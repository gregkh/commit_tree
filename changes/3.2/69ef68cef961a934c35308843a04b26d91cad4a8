xen-blkfront: fix a deadlock while handling discard response

When we get -EOPNOTSUPP response for a discard request, we will clear
the discard flag on the request queue so we won't attempt to send discard
requests to backend again, and this should be protected under rq->queue_lock.
However, when we setup the request queue, we pass blkif_io_lock to
blk_init_queue so rq->queue_lock is blkif_io_lock indeed, and this lock
is already taken when we are in blkif_interrpt, so remove the
spin_lock/spin_unlock when we clear the discard flag or we will end up
with deadlock here
