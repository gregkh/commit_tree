usb: Provide usb_speed_string() function

In a few places in the kernel, the code prints
a human-readable USB device speed (eg. "high speed").
This involves a switch statement sometimes wrapped
around in ({ ... }) block leading to code repetition.

To mitigate this issue, this commit introduces
usb_speed_string() function, which returns
a human-readable name of provided speed.

It also changes a few places switch was used to use
this new function.  This changes a bit the way the
speed is printed in few instances at the same time
standardising it.
