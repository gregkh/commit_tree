x86: Add user_mode_vm check in stack_overflow_check

The kernel stack overflow is checked in stack_overflow_check(),
which may wrongly detect the overflow if the stack pointer in
user space points to the kernel stack intentionally or
accidentally. So, the actual overflow is never detected after
this misdetection because WARN_ONCE() is used on the detection
of it.

This patch adds user-mode-vm checking before it to avoid this
problem and bails out early if the user stack is used.
