net: sch_generic remove redundant use of <linux/module.h>

This file has modular references, but they are limited to
those which are covered by the simple "struct module;"
declaration used in dozens of other places.  In fact that
declaration is already there (just outside of the context
of this commit) so simply remove the include line.
