ARM: 7174/1: Fix build error in kprobes test code on Thumb2 kernels

When compiling kprobes-test-thumb.c an error like below may occur:

/tmp/ccKcuJcG.s:19179: Error: offset out of range

This is caused by the compiler underestimating the size of the inline
assembler instructions containing ".space 0x1000" and failing to spill
the literal pool in time to prevent the generation of PC relative load
instruction with invalid offsets.

The fix implemented by this patch is to replace a single large .space
directive by a number of 4 byte .space's. This requires splitting the
macros which generate test cases for branch instructions into two forms:
one with, and one without support for inserting extra code between
branch and target.
