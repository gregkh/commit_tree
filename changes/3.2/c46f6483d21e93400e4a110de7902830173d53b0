mtd: support reading OOB without ECC

This fixes issues with `nanddump -n' and the MEMREADOOB[64] ioctls on
hardware that performs error correction when reading only OOB data. A
driver for such hardware needs to know when we're doing a RAW vs. a
normal write, but mtd_do_read_oob does not pass such information to the
lower layers (e.g., NAND). We should pass MTD_OOB_RAW or MTD_OOB_PLACE
based on the MTD file mode.

For now, most drivers can get away with just setting:

  chip->ecc.read_oob_raw = chip->ecc.read_oob

This is done by default; but for systems that behave as described above,
you must supply your own replacement function.

This was tested with nandsim as well as on actual SLC NAND.
