Smack: check permissions from user space (v2)

Adds a new file into SmackFS called 'access'. Wanted
Smack permission is written into /smack/access.
After that result can be read from the opened file.
If access applies result contains 1 and otherwise
0. File access is protected from race conditions
by using simple_transaction_get()/set() API.

Fixes from the previous version:
- Removed smack.h changes, refactoring left-over
from previous version.
- Removed #include <linux/smack.h>, refactoring
left-over from previous version.
