TOMOYO: Allow domain transition without execve().

To be able to split permissions for Apache's CGI programs which are executed
without execve(), add special domain transition which is performed by writing
a TOMOYO's domainname to /sys/kernel/security/tomoyo/self_domain interface.

This is an API for TOMOYO-aware userland applications. However, since I expect
TOMOYO and other LSM modules to run in parallel, this patch does not use
/proc/self/attr/ interface in order to avoid conflicts with other LSM modules
when it became possible to run multiple LSM modules in parallel.
