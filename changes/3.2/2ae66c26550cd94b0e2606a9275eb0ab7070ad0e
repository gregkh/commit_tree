ALSA: hda: option to enable arbitrary buffer/period sizes

Add new parameter to disable rounding of buffer/period sizes to
multiples of 128 bytes. This is more efficient in terms of memory
access but isn't required by the HDA spec and prevents users from
specifying exact period/buffer sizes. For example for 44.1kHz, a
period size set to 20ms will be rounded to 19.59ms.

Tested and enabled on Intel HDA controllers. Option is disabled by
default for other controllers.
