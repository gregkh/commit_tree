cifs: clean up checkSMB

The variable names in this function are so ambiguous that it's very
difficult to know what it's doing. Rename them to make it a bit more
clear.

Also, remove a redundant length check. cifsd checks to make sure that
the rfclen isn't larger than the maximum frame size when it does the
receive.

Finally, change checkSMB to return a real error code (-EIO) when
it finds an error. That will help simplify some coming changes in the
callers.
