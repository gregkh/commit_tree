mmc: core: Add Power Off Notify Feature eMMC 4.5

This patch adds support for the power off notify feature, available in
eMMC 4.5 devices. If the host has support for this feature, then the
mmc core will notify the device by setting the POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION
byte in the extended csd register with a value of 1 (POWER_ON).

For suspend mode short timeout is used, whereas for the normal poweroff
long timeout is used.
