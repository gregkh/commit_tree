ASoC: Allow DAI formats to be specified in the dai_link

For almost all machines the DAI format is a constant, always set to the
same thing. This means that not only should we normally set it on init
rather than in hw_params() (where it has been for historical reasons) we
should also allow users to configure this by setting a variable in the
dai_link structure. The combination of these two will make many machine
drivers even more data driven.

Implement a new dai_fmt field in the dai_link doing just that. Since 0 is
a valid value for many format flags and we need to be able to tell if the
field is actually set also add one to all the values used to configure
formats.
