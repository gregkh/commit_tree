xfs: optimize fsync on directories

Directories are only updated transactionally, which means fsync only
needs to flush the log the inode is currently dirty, but not bother
with checking for dirty data, non-transactional updates, and most
importanly doesn't have to flush disk caches except as part of a
transaction commit.

While the first two optimizations can't easily be measured, the
latter actually makes a difference when doing lots of fsync that do
not actually have to commit the inode, e.g. because an earlier fsync
already pushed the log far enough.

The new xfs_dir_fsync is identical to xfs_nfs_commit_metadata except
for the prototype, but I'm not sure creating a common helper for the
two is worth it given how simple the functions are.
