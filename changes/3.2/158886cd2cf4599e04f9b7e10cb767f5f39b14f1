xHCI: fix bug in xhci_clear_command_ring()

When system enters suspend, xHCI driver clears command ring by writing zero
to all the TRBs. However, this also writes zero to the Link TRB, and the ring
is mangled. This may cause driver accesses wrong memory address and the
result is unpredicted.

When clear the command ring, keep the last Link TRB intact, only clear its
cycle bit. This should fix the "command ring full" issue reported by Oliver
Neukum.

This should be backported to stable kernels as old as 2.6.37, since the
commit 89821320 "xhci: Fix command ring replay after resume" is merged.
