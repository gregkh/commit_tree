mac80211: allow out-of-band EOSP notification

iwlwifi has a separate EOSP notification from
the device, and to make use of that properly
it needs to be passed to mac80211. To be able
to mix with tx_status_irqsafe and rx_irqsafe
it also needs to be an "_irqsafe" version in
the sense that it goes through the tasklet,
the actual flag clearing would be IRQ-safe
but doing it directly would cause reordering
issues.

This is needed in the case of a P2P GO going
into an absence period without transmitting
any frames that should be driver-released as
in this case there's no other way to inform
mac80211 that the service period ended. Note
that for drivers that don't use the _irqsafe
functions another version of this function
will be required.
