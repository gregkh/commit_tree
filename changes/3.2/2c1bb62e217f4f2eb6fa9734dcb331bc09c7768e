[media] s5p-fimc: Fix buffer dequeue order issue

When requested more than 2 buffers the buffer dequeue order was wrong
due to erroneous updating FIMC registers in every interrupt handler
call. This also fixes regression of resetting the output DMA buffer
pointer at wrong time, when some buffers are already queued in hardware.
The hardware is reset in the start_streaming callback in order to align
the H/W state with the software output buffer pointer (buf_index).

Additionally a simple write to S5P_CISCCTRL register is replaced with
a read/modification/write to make sure the scaler is not being disabled
in fimc_hw_set_scaler().
