perf hists: Threaded addition and sorting of entries

By using a mutex just for inserting and rotating two hist_entry rb
trees, so that when sorting we can get the last batch of entries created
from the ring buffer, merge it with whatever we have processed so far
and show the output while new entries are being added.

The 'report' tool continues, for now, to do it without threading, but
will use this in the future to allow visualization of results in long
perf.data sessions while the entries are being processed.

The new 'top' tool will be the first user.
