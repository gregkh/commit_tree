[SCSI] ipr: Always initiate hard reset in kdump kernel

During kdump testing I noticed timeouts when initialising each IPR
adapter. While the driver has logic to detect an adapter in an
indeterminate state, it wasn't triggering and each adapter went
through a 5 minute timeout before finally going operational.

Some analysis showed the needs_hard_reset flag wasn't getting set.
We can check the reset_devices kernel parameter which is set by
kdump and force a full reset. This fixes the problem.
