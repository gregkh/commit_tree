usb/isp1760: Allow to optionally trigger low-level chip reset via GPIOLIB.

Properly triggering the reset wire is necessary with the ISP1761 used
on Terasic DE4 Altera-FPGA boards using a NIOS2 processor, for example.

This is an optional implementation for the OF binding only. The other
bindings just pass an invalid GPIO to the isp1760_register() routine.

Example, usage in DTS:
        gpios = <&pio_isp1761rst_0 0 1>;
to point to a GPIO controller from within the ISP1761 node: GPIO 0, active low.
