ftrace/kprobes: Fix not to delete probes if in use

Fix kprobe-tracer not to delete a probe if the probe is in use.
In that case, delete operation will return -EBUSY.

This bug can cause a kernel panic if enabled probes are deleted
during perf record.

(Add some probes on functions)
sh-4.2# perf probe --del probe:\*
sh-4.2# exit
(kernel panic)

This is originally reported on the fedora bugzilla:

 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=742383

I've also checked that this problem doesn't happen on
tracepoints when module removing because perf event
locks target module.

$ sudo ./perf record -e xfs:\* -aR sh
sh-4.2# rmmod xfs
ERROR: Module xfs is in use
sh-4.2# exit
[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.203 MB perf.data (~8862 samples) ]
