cifs: simplify read_from_socket

Move the iovec handling entirely into read_from_socket. That simplifies
the code and gets rid of the special handling for header reads. With
this we can also get rid of the "goto incomplete_rcv" label in the main
demultiplex thread function since we can now treat header and non-header
receives the same way.

Also, make it return an int (since we'll never receive enough to worry
about the sign bit anyway), and simply make it return the amount of bytes
read or a negative error code.
