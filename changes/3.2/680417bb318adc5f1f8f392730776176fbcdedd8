[media] dib0700: correct error message

The goal of this patch is to correct a previous patch. In case of error,
the err() function should be used instead of dprintk() function.

[mchehab@redhat.com: as I've replaced dprintk by deb_info, on the the
 previous patch, to avoid breaking bisect, I had to fix a merge conflict
 on this one]
