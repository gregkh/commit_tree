macvtap: Fix macvtap_open races in the zero copy enable code.

To see if it is appropriate to enable the macvtap zero copy feature
don't test the lowerdev network device flags.   Instead test the
macvtap network device flags which are a direct copy of the lowerdev
flags.  This is important because nothing holds a reference to lowerdev
and on a very bad day we lowerdev could be a pointer to stale memory.
