btrfs: Do not use bio->bi_bdev after submission

The block layer modifies bio->bi_bdev and bio->bi_sector while working on
the bio, they do _not_ come back unmodified in the completion callback.

To call add_page, we need at least some bi_bdev set, which is why the code
was working, previously. With this patch, we use the latest_bdev from
fsinfo instead of the leftover in the bio. This gives us the possibility to
use the bi_bdev field for another purpose.
