KVM: SVM: Keep intercepting task switching with NPT enabled

AMD processors apparently have a bug in the hardware task switching
support when NPT is enabled. If the task switch triggers a NPF, we can
get wrong EXITINTINFO along with that fault. On resume, spurious
exceptions may then be injected into the guest.

We were able to reproduce this bug when our guest triggered #SS and the
handler were supposed to run over a separate task with not yet touched
stack pages.

Work around the issue by continuing to emulate task switches even in
NPT mode.
