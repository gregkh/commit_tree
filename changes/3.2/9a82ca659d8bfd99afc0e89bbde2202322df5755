Btrfs: take overflow into account in reserving space

My overcommit stuff can be a little racy when we're filling up the disk with
fs_mark and we overcommit into things that quickly get used up for data.  So use
num_bytes to see if we have enough available space so we're less likely to
overcommit ourselves out of the ability to make reservations.  Thanks,
