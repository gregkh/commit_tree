PM / Runtime: Update document about callbacks

Support for device power domains has been introduced in
commit 9659cc0678b954f187290c6e8b247a673c5d37e1 (PM: Make
system-wide PM and runtime PM treat subsystems consistently),
also power domain callbacks will take precedence over subsystem ones
from commit 4d27e9dcff00a6425d779b065ec8892e4f391661(PM: Make
power domain callbacks take precedence over subsystem ones).

So update part of "Device Runtime PM Callbacks" in
Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt.
