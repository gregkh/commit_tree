[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fixing the /proc/interrupts problem V3

Fix be2iscsi driver to use a separate pointer for each irq action->name
field and avoid display corruption in /proc/interrupts. The be2iscsi driver
was using a single static array in a function for the irq action->name field.
This results in garbage output from  /proc/interrupts

The pointer for action->name is garbage and scribbles the output on the screen.

This patch fixes the problem:

This patch is based on Prarit's patch here:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg52325.html
but I have fixed up the failure paths and removed
redundant check for !i suggested by Eike.
