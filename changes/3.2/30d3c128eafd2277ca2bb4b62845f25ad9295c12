mm: add a "struct page_frag" type containing a page, offset and length

A few network drivers currently use skb_frag_struct for this purpose but I have
patches which add additional fields and semantics there which these other uses
do not want.

A structure for reference sub-page regions seems like a generally useful thing
so do so instead of adding a network subsystem specific structure.
