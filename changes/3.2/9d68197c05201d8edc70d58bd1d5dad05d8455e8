rcu: Don't destroy rcu_torture_boost() callback until it is done

The rcu_torture_boost() cleanup code destroyed debug-objects state before
waiting for the last RCU callback to be invoked, resulting in rare but
very real debug-objects warnings.  Move the destruction to after the
waiting to fix this problem.
