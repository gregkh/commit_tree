xfs: move firstblock and bmap freelist cursor into bmalloca structure

Rather than passing the firstblock and freelist structure around,
embed it into the bmalloca structure and remove it from the function
parameters.

This also enables the minleft parameter to be set only once in
xfs_bmapi_write(), and the freelist cursor directly queried in
xfs_bmapi_allocate to clear it when the lowspace algorithm is
activated.
