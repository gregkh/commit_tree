hwmon: (coretemp) Fix for non-SMP builds

The definition of TO_ATTR_NO in the non-SMP case is wrong. As the SMP
definition resolves to the correct value, just use this for both
cases.

Without this fix the temperature attributes are named temp0_* instead
of temp2_*, so libsensors won't pick them. Broken since kernel 3.0.
