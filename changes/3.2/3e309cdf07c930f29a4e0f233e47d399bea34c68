PCI quirk: mmc: Always check for lower base frequency quirk for Ricoh 1180:e823

Commit 15bed0f2f added a quirk for the e823 Ricoh card reader to lower the
base frequency.  However, the quirk first checks to see if the proprietary
MMC controller is disabled, and returns if so.  On some devices, such as the
Lenovo X220, the MMC controller is already disabled by firmware it seems,
but the frequency change is still needed so sdhci-pci can talk to the cards.
Since the MMC controller is disabled, the frequency fixup was never being run
on these machines.

This moves the e823 check above the MMC controller check so that it always
gets run.
