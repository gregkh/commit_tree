[S390] fix page change underindication in pgste_update_all

This patch makes sure we don't underindicate _PAGE_CHANGED in case
we have a race between an operation that changes the page and this
code path that hits us between page_get_storage_key and
page_set_storage_key. Note that we still have a potential
underindication on _PAGE_REFERENCED in the unlikely event that
the page was changed but not referenced _and_ someone references
the page in the race window. That's not considered to be a problem.
