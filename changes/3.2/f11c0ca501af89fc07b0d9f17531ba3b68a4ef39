mm: vmscan: drop nr_force_scan[] from get_scan_count

The nr_force_scan[] tuple holds the effective scan numbers for anon and
file pages in case the situation called for a forced scan and the
regularly calculated scan numbers turned out zero.

However, the effective scan number can always be assumed to be
SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX right before the division into anon and file.  The
numerators and denominator are properly set up for all cases, be it force
scan for just file, just anon, or both, to do the right thing.
