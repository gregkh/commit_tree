ipv4: Don't use the cached pmtu informations for input routes

The pmtu informations on the inetpeer are visible for output and
input routes. On packet forwarding, we might propagate a learned
pmtu to the sender. As we update the pmtu informations of the
inetpeer on demand, the original sender of the forwarded packets
might never notice when the pmtu to that inetpeer increases.
So use the mtu of the outgoing device on packet forwarding instead
of the pmtu to the final destination.
