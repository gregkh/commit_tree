ASoC: mxs-saif: add record function

1. add different clkmux mode handling
SAIF can use two instances to implement full duplex (playback &
recording) and record saif may work on EXTMASTER mode which is
using other saif's BITCLK&LRCLK.

The clkmux mode could be set in pdata->init() in mach-specific code.
For generic saif driver, it only needs to know who is his master
and the master id is also provided in mach-specific code.

2. support playback and capture simutaneously however the sample
rates can not be different due to hw limitation.
