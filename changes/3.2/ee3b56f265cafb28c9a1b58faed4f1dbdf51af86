ceph: use kernel DNS resolver

Change ceph_parse_ips to take either names given as
IP addresses or standard hostnames (e.g. localhost).
The DNS lookup is done using the dns_resolver facility
similar to its use in AFS, NFS, and CIFS.

This patch defines CONFIG_CEPH_LIB_USE_DNS_RESOLVER
that controls if this feature is on or off.
