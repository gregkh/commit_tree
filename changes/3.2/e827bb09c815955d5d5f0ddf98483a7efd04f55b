crypto: blowfish-x86_64 - improve x86_64 blowfish 4-way performance

This patch adds improved F-macro for 4-way parallel functions. With new
F-macro for 4-way parallel functions, blowfish sees ~15% improvement in
speed tests on AMD Phenom II (~5% on Intel Xeon E7330).

However when used in 1-way blowfish function new macro would be ~10%
slower than original, so old F-macro is kept for 1-way functions.
Patch cleans up old F-macro as it is no longer needed in 4-way part.

Patch also does register macro renaming to reduce stack usage.
