slub: use correct parameter to add a page to partial list tail

unfreeze_partials() needs add the page to partial list tail, since such page
hasn't too many free objects. We now explictly use DEACTIVATE_TO_TAIL for this,
while DEACTIVATE_TO_TAIL != 1. This will cause performance regression (eg, more
lock contention in node->list_lock) without below fix.
