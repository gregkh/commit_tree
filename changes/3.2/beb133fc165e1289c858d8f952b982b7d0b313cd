mtd: rename MTD_MODE_* to MTD_FILE_MODE_*

These modes hold their state only for the life of their file descriptor,
and they overlap functionality with the MTD_OPS_* modes. Particularly,
MTD_MODE_RAW and MTD_OPS_RAW cover the same function: to provide raw
(i.e., without ECC) access to the flash. In fact, although it may not be
clear, MTD_MODE_RAW implied that operations should enable the
MTD_OPS_RAW mode.

Thus, we should be specific on what each mode means. This is a start,
where MTD_FILE_MODE_* actually represents a "file mode," not necessarily
a true global MTD mode.
