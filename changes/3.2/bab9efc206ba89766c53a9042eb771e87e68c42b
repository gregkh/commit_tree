vmwgfx: integer overflow in vmw_kms_update_layout_ioctl()

There are two issues in vmw_kms_update_layout_ioctl().  First, the
for loop forgets to index rects and only checks the first element.
Second, there is a potential integer overflow if userspace passes
in a large arg->num_outputs.  The call to kzalloc() would allocate
a small buffer, leading to out-of-bounds read.
