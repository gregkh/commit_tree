ata_piix: make DVD Drive recognisable on systems with Intel Sandybridge chipsets(v2)

This quirk patch fixes one kind of bug inside some Intel Sandybridge
chipsets, see reports from

       https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40592.

Many guys also have reported the problem before:

	https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/737388
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/794642
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/782389
	......

With help from Tejun, the problem is found to be caused by 32bit PIO
mode, so introduce the quirk patch to disable 32bit PIO on SATA piix
for some Sandybridge CPT chipsets.

Seth also tested the patch on all five affected chipsets
(pci device ID: 0x1c00, 0x1c01, 0x1d00, 0x1e00, 0x1e01), and found
the patch does fix the problem.
