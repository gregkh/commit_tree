ARM: OMAP4: HWMOD: Add HWMOD_CONTROL_OPT_CLKS_IN_RESET for dss_core

DSS needs all DSS clocks to be enabled to be able to finish reset
properly. Before v3.1-rc1 the omapdss driver was managing clocks and
resets correctly. However, when omapdss started using runtime PM at
v3.1-rc1, the responsibility for the reset moved to HWMOD framework.

HWMOD framework does not currently enable all the DSS clocks when
resetting the DSS hardware. This causes the HWMOD frameworks boot-time
reset to fail, possibly leaving the DSS hardware in undefined state.

This patch sets HWMOD_CONTROL_OPT_CLKS_IN_RESET for dss_core. The flag
is actually not used on OMAP4, because dss_core hardware does not have
soft-reset functionality and thus the HWMOD framework never resets nor
waits for the reset to finish.

However, while the flag is not strictly needed currently, I think it
represents the HW correctly: all the DSS clocks should be enabled after
power-on to allow DSS hardware to finish its reset.

A custom reset function will be added in the following patches which
manages this correctly for OMAP4.
