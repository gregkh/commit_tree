microblaze: Remove __ARCH_WANT_INTERRUPTS_ON_CTXSW usage

As far as I can tell the only reason microblaze has
__ARCH_WANT_INTERRUPTS_ON_CTXSW is because it initializes new task state
with interrupts enabled so that on switch_to() interrupts get enabled.

So change copy_thread() to clear MSR_IE instead of set it, this will
ensure switch_to() will always keep IRQs disabled.

The scheduler will disable IRQs when taking rq->lock in schedule() and
enable IRQs in finish_lock_switch() after its done its magic.

This leaves ARM the only __ARCH_WANT_INTERRUPTS_ON_CTXSW user.
