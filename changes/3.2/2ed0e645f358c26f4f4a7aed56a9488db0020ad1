genirq: Don't allow per cpu interrupts to be suspended

The power management functions related to interrupts do not know
(yet) about per-cpu interrupts and end up calling the wrong
low-level methods to enable/disable interrupts.

This leads to all kind of interesting issues (action taken on one
CPU only, updating a refcount which is not used otherwise...).

The workaround for the time being is simply to flag these interrupts
with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND. At least on ARM, these interrupts are actually
dealt with at the architecture level.
