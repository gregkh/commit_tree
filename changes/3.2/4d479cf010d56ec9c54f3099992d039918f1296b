Btrfs: sectorsize align offsets in fiemap

We've been hitting BUG()'s in btrfs_cont_expand and btrfs_fallocate and anywhere
else that calls btrfs_get_extent while running xfstests 13 in a loop.  This is
because fiemap is calling btrfs_get_extent with non-sectorsize aligned offsets,
which will end up adding mappings that are not sectorsize aligned, which will
cause problems in some cases for subsequent calls to btrfs_get_extent for
similar areas that are sectorsize aligned.  With this patch I ran xfstests 13 in
a loop for a couple of hours and didn't hit the problem that I could previously
hit in at most 20 minutes.  Thanks,
