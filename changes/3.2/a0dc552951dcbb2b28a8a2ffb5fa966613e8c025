mtd: nand: remove NAND_BBT_SCANBYTE1AND6 option

This patch reverts most of:
    commit 58373ff0afff4cc8ac40608872995f4d87eb72ec
    mtd: nand: more BB Detection refactoring and dynamic scan options

According to the discussion at:
    http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2011-May/035696.html
the NAND_BBT_SCANBYTE1AND6 flag, although technically valid, can break
some existing ECC layouts that use the 6th byte in the OOB for ECC data.
Furthermore, we apparently do not need to scan both bytes 1 and 6 in
the OOB region of the devices under consideration; instead, we only need
to scan one or the other.

Thus, the NAND_BBT_SCANBYTE1AND6 flag is at best unnecessary and at
worst a regression.
