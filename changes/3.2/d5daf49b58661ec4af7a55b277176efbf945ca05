USB: gadget: midi: add midi function driver

This patch adds f_midi.c to implement a USB gadget function that works
with the composite framework, so it can be combined with other USB
functions.

The code for the ALSA/MIDI logic was taken from the midi device gadget,
other parts have been rewritten to benefit from the dynamic descriptor
allocation features.

This was successfully tested on an OMAP3 board.
