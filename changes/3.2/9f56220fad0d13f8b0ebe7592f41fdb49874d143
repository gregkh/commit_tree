ipv6: Do not use routes from locally generated RAs

When hybrid mode is enabled (accept_ra == 2), the kernel also sees RAs
generated locally. This is useful since it allows the kernel to auto-configure
its own interface addresses.

However, if 'accept_ra_defrtr' and/or 'accept_ra_rtr_pref' are set and the
locally generated RAs announce the default route and/or other route information,
the kernel happily inserts bogus routes with its own address as gateway.

With this patch, adding routes from an RA will be skiped when the RAs source
address matches any local address, just as if 'accept_ra_defrtr' and
'accept_ra_rtr_pref' were set to 0.
