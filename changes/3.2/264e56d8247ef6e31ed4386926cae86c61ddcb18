mm: disable user interface to manually rescue unevictable pages

At one point, anonymous pages were supposed to go on the unevictable list
when no swap space was configured, and the idea was to manually rescue
those pages after adding swap and making them evictable again.  But
nowadays, swap-backed pages on the anon LRU list are not scanned without
available swap space anyway, so there is no point in moving them to a
separate list anymore.

The manual rescue could also be used in case pages were stranded on the
unevictable list due to race conditions.  But the code has been around for
a while now and newly discovered bugs should be properly reported and
dealt with instead of relying on such a manual fixup.

In addition to the lack of a usecase, the sysfs interface to rescue pages
from a specific NUMA node has been broken since its introduction, so it's
unlikely that anybody ever relied on that.

This patch removes the functionality behind the sysctl and the
node-interface and emits a one-time warning when somebody tries to access
either of them.
