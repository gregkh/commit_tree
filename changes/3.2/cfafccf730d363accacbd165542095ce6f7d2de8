Bluetooth: Add link_type information to the mgmt Connected event

One piece of information that was lost when using the mgmt interface,
was the type of the connection. Using HCI events we used to know
the type of the connection based on the type of the event, e.g.
HCI_LE_Connection_Complete for LE links.
