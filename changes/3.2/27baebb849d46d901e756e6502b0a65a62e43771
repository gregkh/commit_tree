ext4: tune mballoc's default group prealloc size for bigalloc file systems

The default group preallocation size had been previously set to 512
blocks/clusters, regardless of the block/cluster size.  This is
probably too big for large cluster sizes.  So adjust the default so
that it is 2 megabytes or 32 clusters, whichever is larger.
