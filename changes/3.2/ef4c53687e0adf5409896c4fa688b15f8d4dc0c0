ARM: 7031/1: entry: Fix Thumb-2 undef handling for multi-CPU kernels

When v6 and >=v7 boards are supported in the same kernel, the
__und_usr code currently makes a build-time assumption that Thumb-2
instructions occurring in userspace don't need to be supported.
Strictly speaking this is incorrect.

This patch fixes the above case by doing a run-time check on the
CPU architecture in these cases.  This only affects kernels which
support v6 and >=v7 CPUs together: plain v6 and plain v7 kernels
are unaffected.
