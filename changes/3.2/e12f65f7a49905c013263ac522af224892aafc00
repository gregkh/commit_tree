locking, ACPI: Annotate c3_lock as raw

We cannot preempt this lock on -rt as we are in an
interrupt disabled region and about to go into deep sleep.

In mainline this change documents the low level nature of
the lock - otherwise there's no functional difference. Lockdep
and Sparse checking will work as usual.
