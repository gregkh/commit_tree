xfs: remove delwri buffer handling from xfs_buf_iorequest

We cannot ever reach xfs_buf_iorequest for a buffer with XBF_DELWRI set,
given that all write handlers make sure that the buffer is remove from
the delwri queue before, and we never do reads with the XBF_DELWRI flag
set (which the code would not handle correctly anyway).
