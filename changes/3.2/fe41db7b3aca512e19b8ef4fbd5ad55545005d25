ARM: 7177/1: GIC: avoid skipping non-existent PPIs in irq_start calculation

Commit 4294f8baa ("ARM: gic: add irq_domain support") defines irq_start
as irq_start = (irq_start & ~31) + 16; On a platform with a GIC and a
CPU without PPIs, this results in irq_start being off by 16.

This patch fixes gic_init so that we only carve out a PPI space when
PPIs exist for the GIC being initialised.
