ASoC: davinci-pcm: trivial: replace link with actual chan/link

The ambiguously named variable 'link' is used as a temporary throughout
davinci-pcm -- its presence makes grepping (and groking) the code
difficult.

Replace link with the value of link in almost all sites. The exception
is a couple places where the last-assigned link/chan needs to be
returned by a function -- in these cases, rename to last_link.
