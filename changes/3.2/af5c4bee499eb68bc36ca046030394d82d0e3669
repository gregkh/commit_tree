xfs: remove buffers from the delwri list in xfs_buf_stale

For each call to xfs_buf_stale we call xfs_buf_delwri_dequeue either
directly before or after it, or are guaranteed by the surrounding
conditionals that we are never called on delwri buffers.  Simply
this situation by moving the call to xfs_buf_delwri_dequeue into
xfs_buf_stale.
