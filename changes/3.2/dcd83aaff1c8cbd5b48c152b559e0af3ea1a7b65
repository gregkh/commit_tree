tty/powerpc: introduce the ePAPR embedded hypervisor byte channel driver

The ePAPR embedded hypervisor specification provides an API for "byte
channels", which are serial-like virtual devices for sending and receiving
streams of bytes.  This driver provides Linux kernel support for byte
channels via three distinct interfaces:

1) An early-console (udbg) driver.  This provides early console output
through a byte channel.  The byte channel handle must be specified in a
Kconfig option.

2) A normal console driver.  Output is sent to the byte channel designated
for stdout in the device tree.  The console driver is for handling kernel
printk calls.

3) A tty driver, which is used to handle user-space input and output.  The
byte channel used for the console is designated as the default tty.
