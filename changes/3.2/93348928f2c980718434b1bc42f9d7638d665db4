ath9k_hw: Fix noise floor calibration timeout on fast channel change

During the fast channel change noise floor values are being loaded
twice at init_cal and after channel_change. The commit "ath9k_hw:
Improve fast channel change for AR9003 chips" overlooked it that
caused failure to load nf while doing bgscan. This patch performs noise
floor calibration after the fast and full reset.
