user namespace: usb: make usb urbs user namespace aware (v2)

Add to the dev_state and alloc_async structures the user namespace
corresponding to the uid and euid.  Pass these to kill_pid_info_as_uid(),
which can then implement a proper, user-namespace-aware uid check.

Changelog:
Sep 20: Per Oleg's suggestion: Instead of caching and passing user namespace,
	uid, and euid each separately, pass a struct cred.
Sep 26: Address Alan Stern's comments: don't define a struct cred at
	usbdev_open(), and take and put a cred at async_completed() to
	ensure it lasts for the duration of kill_pid_info_as_cred().
