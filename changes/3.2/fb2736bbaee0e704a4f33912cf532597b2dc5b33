regmap: Add basic tracepoints

Trace single register reads and writes, plus start/stop tracepoints for
the actual I/O to see where we're spending time. This makes it easy to
have always on logging without overwhelming the logs and also lets us take
advantage of all the context and time information that the trace subsystem
collects for us.

We don't currently trace register values for bulk operations as this would
add complexity and overhead parsing the cooked data that's being worked
with.
