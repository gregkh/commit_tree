sony-laptop:irq: Remove IRQF_DISABLED

Since commit [e58aa3d2: genirq: Run irq handlers with interrupts disabled],
We run all interrupt handlers with interrupts disabled
and we even check and yell when an interrupt handler
returns with interrupts enabled (see commit [b738a50a:
genirq: Warn when handler enables interrupts]).

So now this flag is a NOOP and can be removed.
