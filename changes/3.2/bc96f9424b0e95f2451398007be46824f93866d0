drm/radeon/kms: Hide debugging message

Use the proper macro to issue the debugging message in
radeon_atif_call(). Otherwise we spam the log of many systems with a
message which looks like an error message of unknown origin, and could
thus confuse the user. Commit dc77de12dde95c8da39e4c417eb70c7d445cf84b
was a first step in this direction, but was not sufficient IMHO.
