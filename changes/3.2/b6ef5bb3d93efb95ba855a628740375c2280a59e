[S390] add TIF_SYSCALL thread flag

Add an explicit TIF_SYSCALL bit that indicates if a task is inside
a system call. The svc_code in the pt_regs structure is now only
valid if TIF_SYSCALL is set. With this definition TIF_RESTART_SVC
can be replaced with TIF_SYSCALL. Overall do_signal is a bit more
readable and it saves a few lines of code.
