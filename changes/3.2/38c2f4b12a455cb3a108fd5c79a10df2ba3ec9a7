nfsd4: look up stateid's per clientid

Use a separate stateid idr per client, and lookup a stateid by first
finding the client, then looking up the stateid relative to that client.

Also some minor refactoring.

This allows us to improve error returns: we can return expired when the
clientid is not found and bad_stateid when the clientid is found but not
the stateid, as opposed to returning expired for both cases.

I hope this will also help to replace the state lock mostly by a
per-client lock, but that hasn't been done yet.
