lib/kstrtox: common code between kstrto*() and simple_strto*() functions

Currently termination logic (\0 or \n\0) is hardcoded in _kstrtoull(),
avoid that for code reuse between kstrto*() and simple_strtoull().
Essentially, make them different only in termination logic.

simple_strtoull() (and scanf(), BTW) ignores integer overflow, that's a
bug we currently don't have guts to fix, making KSTRTOX_OVERFLOW hack
necessary.

Almost forgot: patch shrinks code size by about ~80 bytes on x86_64.
