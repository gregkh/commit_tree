rtnetlink: Add missing manual netlink notification in dev_change_net_namespaces

Renato Westphal noticed that since commit a2835763e130c343ace5320c20d33c281e7097b7
"rtnetlink: handle rtnl_link netlink notifications manually" was merged
we no longer send a netlink message when a networking device is moved
from one network namespace to another.

Fix this by adding the missing manual notification in dev_change_net_namespaces.

Since all network devices that are processed by dev_change_net_namspaces are
in the initialized state the complicated tests that guard the manual
rtmsg_ifinfo calls in rollback_registered and register_netdevice are
unnecessary and we can just perform a plain notification.
