KVM: s390: Fix RUNNING flag misinterpretation

CPUSTAT_RUNNING was implemented signifying that a vcpu is not stopped.
This is not, however, what the architecture says: RUNNING should be
set when the host is acting on the behalf of the guest operating
system.

CPUSTAT_RUNNING has been changed to be set in kvm_arch_vcpu_load()
and to be unset in kvm_arch_vcpu_put().

For signifying stopped state of a vcpu, a host-controlled bit has
been used and is set/unset basically on the reverse as the old
CPUSTAT_RUNNING bit (including pushing it down into stop handling
proper in handle_stop()).
