IDE: Don't powerdown Compaq Triflex IDE device on suspend

Don't powerdown Compaq Triflex IDE device on suspend

This fixes APM suspend on Compaq Armada 7400.
APM BIOS doesn't suspend if IDE is powered down when suspending.
The Triflex controller is found only on old Compaq boards,
so this patch will hopefully have no side effects.

This patch fixes a suspend regression introduced in
feb22b7f8e62b1b987a3a1dbad95af767a1df832 ("ide: add proper PCI PM
support (v2)").
