irq: support domains with non-zero hwirq base

Interrupt controllers can have non-zero starting value for h/w irq numbers.
Adding support in irq_domain allows the domain hwirq numbering to match
the interrupt controllers' numbering.

As this makes looping over irqs for a domain more complicated, add loop
iterators to iterate over all hwirqs and irqs for a domain.
