macvtap: Rewrite macvtap_newlink so the error handling works.

Place macvlan_common_newlink at the end of macvtap_newlink because
failing in newlink after registering your network device is not
supported.

Move device_create into a netdevice creation notifier.   The network device
notifier is the only hook that is called after the network device has been
registered with the device layer and before register_network_device returns
success.
