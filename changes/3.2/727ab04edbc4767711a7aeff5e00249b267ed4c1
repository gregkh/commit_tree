perf evlist: Fix grouping of multiple events

The __perf_evsel__open routing was grouping just the threads for that
specific events per cpu when we want to group all threads in all events
to the first fd opened on that cpu.

So pass the xyarray with the first event, where the other events will be
able to get that first per cpu fd.

At some point top and record will switch to using perf_evlist__open that
takes care of this detail and probably will also handle the fallback
from hw to soft counters, etc.
