bio: change some signed vars to unsigned

This is just a cleanup patch to silence a static checker warning.

The problem is that we cap "nr_iovecs" so it can't be larger than
"UIO_MAXIOV" but we don't check for negative values.  It turns out this is
prevented at other layers, but logically it doesn't make sense to have
negative nr_iovecs so making it unsigned is nicer.
