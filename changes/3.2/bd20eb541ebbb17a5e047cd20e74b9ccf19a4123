regmap: Allow drivers to specify register defaults

It is useful for the register cache code to be able to specify the
default values for the device registers. The major use is when restoring
the register cache after suspend, knowing the register defaults allows
us to skip registers that are at their default values when we resume which
can be a substantial win on larger modern devices. For some devices
(mostly older ones) the hardware does not support readback so the only way we
can know the values is from code and so initializing the cache with default
values makes it much easier for drivers work with read/modify/write
updates.
