usb: dwc3: debugfs: remove test mode interface

There are some issues around for enabling/disabling this mode and
handling it. It does not work perfectly (yet). However we have a few
gadgets tested successfuly so far. That means we are quite confident
that we won't need this in near future.
So I'm for removing it and bringing a working version back once there is
a need for it.

Thanks to Dan Carpenter who spotted the wrong memory handling here.
