fs/pipe.c: add ->statfs callback for pipefs

Currently a statfs on a pipe's /proc/<pid>/fd/ link returns -ENOSYS.  Wire
pipfs up so that the statfs succeeds.

This is required by checkpoint-restart in the userspace to make it
possible to distinguish pipes from fifos.

When we dump information about task's open files we use the /proc/pid/fd
directoy's symlinks and the fact that opening any of them gives us exactly
the same dentry->inode pair as the original process has.  Now if a task
we're dumping has opened pipe and fifo we need to detect this and act
accordingly.  Knowing that an fd with type S_ISFIFO resides on a pipefs is
the most precise way.
