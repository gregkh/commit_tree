dm table: propagate non rotational flag

Allow QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT to propagate up the device stack if all
underlying devices are non-rotational.  Tools like ureadahead will
schedule IOs differently based on the rotational flag.

With this patch, I see boot time go from 7.75 s to 7.46 s on my device.
