b43: Fix swatch warning

Swatch reports the following warning for main.c:

  CHECK   drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c
drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c +4115 b43_wireless_core_stop(7) warn: variable dereferenced before check 'dev'

After analysis, this is not a bug, but a false warning. Nonetheless,
a cleanup is in order to prevent some future janitor proposing
the wrong fix, as I did in my original patch.
