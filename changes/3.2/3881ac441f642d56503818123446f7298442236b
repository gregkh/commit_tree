af_iucv: add HiperSockets transport

The current transport mechanism for af_iucv is the z/VM offered
communications facility IUCV. To provide equivalent support when
running Linux in an LPAR, HiperSockets transport is added to the
AF_IUCV address family. It requires explicit binding of an AF_IUCV
socket to a HiperSockets device. A new packet_type ETH_P_AF_IUCV
is announced. An af_iucv specific transport header is defined
preceding the skb data. A small protocol is implemented for
connecting and for flow control/congestion management.
