ipv4: fix redirect handling

commit f39925dbde77 (ipv4: Cache learned redirect information in
inetpeer.) introduced a regression in ICMP redirect handling.

It assumed ipv4_dst_check() would be called because all possible routes
were attached to the inetpeer we modify in ip_rt_redirect(), but thats
not true.

commit 7cc9150ebe (route: fix ICMP redirect validation) tried to fix
this but solution was not complete. (It fixed only one route)

So we must lookup existing routes (including different TOS values) and
call check_peer_redir() on them.
