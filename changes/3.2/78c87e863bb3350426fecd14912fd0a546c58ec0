[media] v4l2-event: Remove pending events from fh event queue when unsubscribing

The kev pointers inside the pending events queue (the available queue) of the
fh point to data inside the sev, unsubscribing frees the sev, thus making these
pointers point to freed memory!

This patch fixes these dangling pointers in the available queue by removing
all matching pending events on unsubscription.
