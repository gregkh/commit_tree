um: take ldt.h to arch/x86/um/asm/mm_context.h

it's x86-only and we have no business playing with it in asm/mmu.h; make
the latter have
	struct uml_arch_mm_context arch;
instead of
	struct uml_ldt ldt;
and let arch/<subarch>/um/asm/mm_context.h decide what'll be in there.
While we are at it, kill host_ldt.h - it's not needed in part of places
that include it (we want asm/ldt.h in those) and it can be trivially
expanded into the single remaining one.
