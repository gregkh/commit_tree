ixgbe: Change default Tx work limit size to 256 buffers

This change makes it so that the default Tx work limit is 256 buffers or
1/2 of an entire ring instead of a full ring size so that it is much more
likely that we will be able to actually reach the work limit value.
Previously with the value set to an entire ring it would not have been
possible for us to trigger an event due to the fact that the Tx work is
stopped at the point where we cannot place one more buffer on the ring and
it is not restarted until cleanup is complete.
