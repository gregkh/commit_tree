rcu: Abstract common code for RCU grace-period-wait primitives

Pull the code that waits for an RCU grace period into a single function,
which is then called by synchronize_rcu() and friends in the case of
TREE_RCU and TREE_PREEMPT_RCU, and from rcu_barrier() and friends in
the case of TINY_RCU and TINY_PREEMPT_RCU.
