xen-gntalloc: signedness bug in add_grefs()

gref->gref_id is unsigned so the error handling didn't work.
gnttab_grant_foreign_access() returns an int type, so we can add a
cast here, and it doesn't cause any problems.
gnttab_grant_foreign_access() can return a variety of errors
including -ENOSPC, -ENOSYS and -ENOMEM.
