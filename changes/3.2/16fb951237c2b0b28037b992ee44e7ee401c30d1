vmscan: count pages into balanced for zone with good watermark

It's possible a zone watermark is ok when entering the balance_pgdat()
loop, while the zone is within the requested classzone_idx.  Count pages
from this zone into `balanced'.  In this way, we can skip shrinking zones
too much for high order allocation.
