ext4: ext4_mkdir should dirty dir_block with newly created directory inode

ext4_mkdir calls ext4_handle_dirty_metadata with dir_block and the inode "dir".
Unfortunately, dir_block belongs to the newly created directory (which is
"inode"), not the parent directory (which is "dir").  Fix the incorrect
association.
