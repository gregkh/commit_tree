udlfb: Enable fb_defio by default

Enables page fault based detection of mmap writes to the framebuffer,
which allows standard fbdev apps (like the generic fbdev xorg driver)
to work on DisplayLink devices.

Not all bugs are shaken out of the fb_defio path of udlfb, but it's
tantalizingly close, so this seems a good time to enable by default.

Alternatively, option can be disabled when running with an xorg driver
that can more directly communicate damaged regions of the framebuffer
via IOCTL. This is a simpler, higher perf option, when available.
