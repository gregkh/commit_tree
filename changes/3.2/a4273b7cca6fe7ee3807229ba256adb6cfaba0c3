OMAPDSS: DISPC: Reduce the number of arguments in dispc_ovl_setup()

dispc_ovl_setup() currently takes a large number of overlay arguments, most of
these are members of the overlay_info struct. Replace these arguments by
passing a overlay_info pointer instead.

In configure_overlay(), we create an overlay_info struct called new_oi, this is
a copy of the overlay cache's overlay_info member. Update the new_oi parameters
which could have been possibly changed in configure_overlay(). Pass its pointer
pointer to dispc_ovl_setup().
