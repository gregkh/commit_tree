mac80211: disable powersave for broken APs

Only AID values 1-2007 are valid, but some APs have been
found to send random bogus values, in the reported case an
AP that was sending the AID field value 0xffff, an AID of
0x3fff (16383).

There isn't much we can do but disable powersave since
there's no way it can work properly in this case.
