USB: option: add various ZTE device network interfaces to the blacklist

IDs found in the Windows driver's ZTEusbnet.inf file from the
ZTE MF100 drivers (O2 UK).  Also fixes the ZTE MF626 device
since it really is distinct from the 4G Systems stick and
apparently needs the net interface blacklisted too, while
there's no indication (yet) that the 4G Systems stick does.
