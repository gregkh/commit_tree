TTY: use tty_wait_until_sent_from_close in tty_port_close_start

Let's use the newly added helper to avoid stalls in drivers which are
already ported to tty_port helpers.

We have to ensure here, that there is no user of tty_port_close_start
and tty_port_close which holds port->mutex (or other) lock over them.
And sure, there is none.
