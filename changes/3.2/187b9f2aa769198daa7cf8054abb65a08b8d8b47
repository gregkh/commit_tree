powerpc/book3e-64: Fix debug support for userspace

With the introduction of CONFIG_PPC_ADV_DEBUG_REGS user space debug is
broken on Book-E 64-bit parts that support delayed debug events.  When
switch_booke_debug_regs() sets DBCR0 we'll start getting debug events as
MSR_DE is also set and we aren't able to handle debug events from kernel
space.

We can remove the hack that always enables MSR_DE and loads up DBCR0 and
just utilize switch_booke_debug_regs() to get user space debug working
again.

We still need to handle critical/debug exception stacks & proper
save/restore of state for those exception levles to support debug events
from kernel space like we have on 32-bit.
