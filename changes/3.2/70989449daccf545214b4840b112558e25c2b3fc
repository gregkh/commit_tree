x86, microcode: Don't request microcode from userspace unnecessarily

Requesting the microcode from userspace *every time* when onlining CPUs
(during a CPU hotplug operation) is unnecessary. Thus, ensure that
once the kernel gets the microcode after booting, it is not freed nor
invalidated when a CPU goes offline, so that it can be reused when that
CPU comes back online, without requesting userspace for it again. As a
result, the CPU hotplug operations become faster as well.
