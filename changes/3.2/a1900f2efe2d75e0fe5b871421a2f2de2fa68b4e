ARM: OMAP4: clock: round_rate and recalc functions for DPLL_ABE

OMAP4 DPLL_ABE can enable a 4X multipler on top of the normal MN multipler
and divider. This is achieved by setting CM_CLKMODE_DPLL_ABE.DPLL_REGM4XEN
bit in CKGEN module of CM1. From the OMAP4 TRM:

Fdpll = Fref x 2 x (4 x M/(N+1)) in case REGM4XEN bit field is set (only
applicable to DPLL_ABE).

Add new round_rate() and recalc() functions for OMAP4, that check the
setting of REGM4XEN bit and handle this appropriately. The new functions
are a simple wrapper on top of the existing omap2_dpll_round_rate() and
omap2_dpll_get_rate() functions to handle the REGM4XEN bit.

The REGM4XEN bit is only implemented for the ABE DPLL on OMAP4 and so
only dpll_abe_ck uses omap4_dpll_regm4xen_round_rate() and
omap4_dpll_regm4xen_recalc() functions.
