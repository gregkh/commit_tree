Remove unneeded version.h includes (and add where needed) for drivers/usb/

It was pointed out by 'make versioncheck' that linux/version.h was not
always being included where needed and sometimes included needlessly
in drivers/usb/.
This patch fixes up the includes.

For the UVC gadget driver bits, this was ACK'ed by Laurent Pinchart.
