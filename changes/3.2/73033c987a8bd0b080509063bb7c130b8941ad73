caif-hsi: Fix for wakeup condition problem

Under stressed conditions a race could happen when del_timer_sync() was called
from softirq context at the same time when mod_timer_pending() for the same
timer was called from the workqueue. This leaded to a state mismatch in the
CAIF HSI driver and following unexpected link wakeup procedure.

The fix puts del_timer_sync() and mod_timer_pending() calls under a spin lock
to protect against the race condition.
