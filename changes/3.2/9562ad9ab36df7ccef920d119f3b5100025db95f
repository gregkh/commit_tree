block: Remove the control of complete cpu from bio.

bio originally has the functionality to set the complete cpu, but
it is broken.

Chirstoph said that "This code is unused, and from the all the
discussions lately pretty obviously broken.  The only thing keeping
it serves is creating more confusion and possibly more bugs."

And Jens replied with "We can kill bio_set_completion_cpu(). I'm fine
with leaving cpu control to the request based drivers, they are the
only ones that can toggle the setting anyway".

So this patch tries to remove all the work of controling complete cpu
from a bio.
