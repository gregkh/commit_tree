[SCSI] libsas: dynamic queue depth

The queue-depth for libsas-attached devices initializes to 32 and can
only be increased manually via sysfs to a max of 64, while mpt2sas
attached devices initialize to 254 and dynamically float via the
midlayer ->change_queue_depth interface.

No performance regression was observed with this change on the isci
driver.
