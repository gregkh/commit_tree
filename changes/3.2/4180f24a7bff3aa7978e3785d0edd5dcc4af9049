mtd: document ABI

We're missing a lot of important documentation in include/mtd/mtd-abi.h:

* add a simple description of each ioctl (feel free to expand!)
* give full explanations of recently added and modified operations
* explain the usage of "RAW" that appear in different modes and types of
  operations
* fix some comment style along the way
