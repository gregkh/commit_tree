usb: gadget: storage: make FSG_NUM_BUFFERS variable size

FSG_NUM_BUFFERS is set to 2 as default.
Usually 2 buffers are enough to establish a good buffering pipeline.
The number may be increased in order to compensate a for bursty VFS
behaviour.

Here follows a description of system that may require more than
2 buffers.
 * CPU ondemand governor active
 * latency cost for wake up and/or frequency change
 * DMA for IO

Use case description.
 * Data transfer from MMC via VFS to USB.
 * DMA shuffles data from MMC and to USB.
 * The CPU wakes up every now and then to pass data in and out from VFS,
   which cause the bursty VFS behaviour.

Test set up
 * Running dd on the host reading from the mass storage device
 * cmdline: dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null bs=4k count=$((256*100))
 * Caches are dropped on the host and on the device before each run

Measurements on a Snowball board with ondemand_governor active.

There may not be one optimal number for all boards. This is why
the number is added to Kconfig. If selecting USB_GADGET_DEBUG_FILES
this value may be set by a module parameter as well.
