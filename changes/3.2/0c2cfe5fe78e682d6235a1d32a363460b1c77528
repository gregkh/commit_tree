target: fix list walking in transport_free_dev_tasks

list_for_each_entry_safe only protects against deletions from the list,
but not against any concurrent modifications.  Given that we drop
t_state_lock inside the loop it is not safe in transport_free_dev_tasks.

Instead of use a local dispose_list that we move all tasks that are
to be deleted to.  This is safe because we never do list_emptry checks
on t_list to check if a command is on the list anywhere.
