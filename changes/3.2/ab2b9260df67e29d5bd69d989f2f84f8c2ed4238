mfd: Fix twl6030 lockdep recursion warning on setting wake IRQs

LOCKDEP explicitly sets all irq_desc locks as a single lock-class,
causing "possible recursive locking detected" when the TWL RTC
driver calls through enable_irq_wake to twl6030_irq_set_wake,
which recursively calls irq_set_irq_wake.  Although the
irq_desc and lock are different, LOCKDEP treats these as
equivalent, presumably due to problems that can be incurred
when locking more than one irq_desc, so best to avoid this.

Suspend/resume actions implemented as PM notifiers to avoid
touch the TWL core for this.
