tipc: Prevent rounding issues when saving connect timeout option

Saves a socket's TIPC_CONN_TIMEOUT socket option value in its original
form (milliseconds), rather than jiffies. This ensures that the exact
value set using setsockopt() is always returned by getsockopt(), without
being subject to rounding issues introduced by a ms->jiffies->ms
conversion sequence.
