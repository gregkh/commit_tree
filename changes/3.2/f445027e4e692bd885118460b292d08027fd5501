stop_machine: make stop_machine safe and efficient to call early

Make stop_machine() safe to call early in boot, before SMP has been set
up, by simply calling the callback function directly if there's only one
CPU online.

[ Fixes from AKPM:
   - add comment
   - local_irq_flags, not save_flags
   - also call hard_irq_disable() for systems which need it

  Tejun suggested using an explicit flag rather than just looking at
  the online cpu count. ]
