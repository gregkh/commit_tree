dmaengine/amba-pl08x: max_bytes_per_lli is TRANSFER_SIZE * src_width (not MIN(width))

max_bytes_per_lli = bd.srcbus.buswidth * PL080_CONTROL_TRANSFER_SIZE_MASK;
This is confirmed by ARM support guys.

Below is summary of mail exchange with them:

[Viresh] What is the total data to be transferred in case source and destination
bus widths are different. Suppose, source bus width is 2 bytes and destination
is 4 bytes. Now in order to transfer 80 bytes, what should be value of
TransferSize field in control reg: 40? or 20?.

[David from ARM] The value that is programmed into the TransferSize field should
be the number of <SourceWidth> transfers needed to achieve the required data
transfer.

So, to transfer 80 bytes, with a Source Width of 2, the TransferSize field =
should be programmed with:

        Total transfer size
        ------------------- = 40
          <source width>

[Viresh] Will this change if source is 4 bytes and dest is 2?

[David] Yes - the calculation then becomes:

        Total transfer size
        ------------------- =20
          <source width>

Also, max_bytes_per_lli must be calculated after fixing src and dest widths not
before that. So move this code to the correct place.

This patch also removes max_bytes_per_lli from earlier print message, as till
that point max_bytes_per_lli is unknown.
