Btrfs: add a log of past tree roots

This takes some of the free space in the btrfs super block
to record information about most of the roots in the last four
commits.

It also adds a -o recovery to use the root history log when
we're not able to read the tree of tree roots, the extent
tree root, the device tree root or the csum root.
