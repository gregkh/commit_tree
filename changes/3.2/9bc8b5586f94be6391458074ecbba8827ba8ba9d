rcu: Suppress NMI backtraces when stall ends before dump

It is possible for an RCU CPU stall to end just as it is detected, in
which case the current code will uselessly dump all CPU's stacks.
This commit therefore checks for this condition and refrains from
sending needless NMIs.

And yes, the stall might also end just after we checked all CPUs and
tasks, but in that case we would at least have given some clue as
to which CPU/task was at fault.
