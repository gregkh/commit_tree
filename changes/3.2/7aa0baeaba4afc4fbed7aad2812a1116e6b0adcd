ext4: Free resources in ext4_mb_init()'s error paths

In commit 79a77c5ac, we move ext4_mb_init_backend after the allocation
of s_locality_group to avoid memory leak in error path, but there are
still some other error paths in ext4_mb_init that need to do the same
work. So this patch adds all the error patch for ext4_mb_init. And all
the pointers are reset to NULL in case the caller may double free them.
