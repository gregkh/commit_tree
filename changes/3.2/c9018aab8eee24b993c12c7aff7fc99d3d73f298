ARM: 7011/1: Add ARM cpu topology definition

The affinity between ARM processors is defined in the MPIDR register.
We can identify which processors are in the same cluster,
and which ones have performance interdependency. We can define the
cpu topology of ARM platform, that is then used by sched_mc and sched_smt.

The default state of sched_mc and sched_smt config is disable.
When enabled, the behavior of the scheduler can be modified with
sched_mc_power_savings and sched_smt_power_savings sysfs interfaces.

Changes since v4 :
*  Remove unnecessary parentheses and blank lines

* Update the format of printk message
