ALSA: hda/hdmi: expose ELD control

Applications may want to read ELD information to
understand what codecs are supported on the HDMI
receiver and handle the a-v delay for better lip-sync.

ELD information is exposed in a device-specific
IFACE_PCM kcontrol. Tested both with amixer and
PulseAudio; with a corresponding patch passthrough modes
are enabled automagically.

ELD control size is set to zero in case of errors or
wrong configurations. No notifications are implemented
for now, it is expected that jack detection is used to
reconfigure the audio outputs.
