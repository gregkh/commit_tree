wl12xx: remove P2P ie from probe response

wl12xx uses a single probe response template, regardless of
the probe request.
However, the P2P spec forbids including the p2p ie in some
cases (e.g. the probe request didn't include the p2p ie).

The fw responds only to probe requests that don't
include the p2p ie, and passes up probe requests that
include them (the supplicant will answer them).

Thus, strip the p2p ie from the probe response template.
