locking, oprofile: Annotate oprofilefs lock as raw

The oprofilefs_lock can be taken in atomic context (in profiling
interrupts) and therefore cannot cannot be preempted on -rt -
annotate it.

In mainline this change documents the low level nature of
the lock - otherwise there's no functional difference. Lockdep
and Sparse checking will work as usual.
