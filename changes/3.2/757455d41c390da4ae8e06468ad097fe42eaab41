locking, latencytop: Annotate latency_lock as raw

The latency_lock is lock can be taken in the guts of the
scheduler code and therefore cannot be preempted on -rt -
annotate it.

In mainline this change documents the low level nature of
the lock - otherwise there's no functional difference. Lockdep
and Sparse checking will work as usual.
