mtd: check parts pointer before using it

The code has the check for parts but it called after kmemdup,
kmemdup(parts, sizeof(*parts) * nr_parts,...)
if (!parts)
	return -ENOMEM

In fact, we need check parts before safely using it.
and we also need check the real_parts to make sure kmemdup
allocation sucessfully.
