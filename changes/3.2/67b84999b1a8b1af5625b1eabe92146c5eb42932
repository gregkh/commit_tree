Revert "tracing: Include module.h in define_trace.h"

This reverts commit 3a9f987b3141f086de27832514aad9f50a53f754.

With all the files that are real modules now having module.h
explicitly called out for inclusion, and no reliance on any
implicit presence of module.h assumed, we should no longer
need this workaround.
