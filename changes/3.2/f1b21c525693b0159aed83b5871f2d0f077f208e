ARM: davinci: da850 evm: change audio edma event queue to EVENTQ_0

On OMAP-L138 platform, EDMA event queue 0 should be used for audio
transfers so that they are not starved by video data moving on event queue 1.

Commit 48519f0ae03bc7e86b3dc93e56f1334d53803770 (ASoC: davinci: let platform
data define edma queue numbers) had a side-effect of changing this behavior
by making the driver actually honor the platform data passed.

Fix this now by passing event queue 0 as the queue to be used for audio
transfers.
