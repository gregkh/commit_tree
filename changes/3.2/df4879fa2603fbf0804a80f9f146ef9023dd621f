ARM: zImage: gather some string functions into string.c

This is a small subset of string functions needed by commits to come.
Except for memcpy() which is unchanged from its original location, their
implementation is meant to be small, and -Os is enforced to prevent gcc
from doing pointless loop unrolling.
