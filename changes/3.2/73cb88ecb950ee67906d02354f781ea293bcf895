net: make the tcp and udp file_operations for the /proc stuff const

the tcp and udp code creates a set of struct file_operations at runtime
while it can also be done at compile time, with the added benefit of then
having these file operations be const.

the trickiest part was to get the "THIS_MODULE" reference right; the naive
method of declaring a struct in the place of registration would not work
for this reason.
