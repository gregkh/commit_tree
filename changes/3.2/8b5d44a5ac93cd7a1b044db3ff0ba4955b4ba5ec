xen: allow balloon driver to use more than one memory region

Allow the xen balloon driver to populate its list of extra pages from
more than one region of memory.  This will allow platforms to provide
(for example) a region of low memory and a region of high memory.

The maximum possible number of extra regions is 128 (== E820MAX) which
is quite large so xen_extra_mem is placed in __initdata.  This is safe
as both xen_memory_setup() and balloon_init() are in __init.

The balloon regions themselves are not altered (i.e., there is still
only the one region).
