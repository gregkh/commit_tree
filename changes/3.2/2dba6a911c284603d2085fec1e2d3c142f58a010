md: don't delay reboot by 1 second if no MD devices exist

The md_notify_reboot() method includes a call to mdelay(1000),
to deal with "exotic SCSI devices" which are too volatile on
reboot. The delay is unconditional. Even if the machine does
not have any block devices, let alone MD devices, the kernel
shutdown sequence is slowed down.

1 second does not matter much with physical hardware, but with
certain virtualization use cases any wasted time in the bootup
& shutdown sequence counts for alot.

* drivers/md/md.c: md_notify_reboot() - only impose a delay if
  there was at least one MD device to be stopped during reboot
