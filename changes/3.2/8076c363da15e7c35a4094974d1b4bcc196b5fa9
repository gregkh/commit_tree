udf: Rename udf_error to udf_err

Rename udf_error to udf_err for consistency with normal logging
uses of pr_err.

Rename function udf_err to _udf_err.
Remove __func__ from uses and move __func__ to a new udf_err
macro that calls _udf_err.
Some of the udf_error uses had \n terminations, some did not so
standardize \n's to udf_err uses, remove \n from _udf_err function.
Coalesce udf_err formats.
One message prefixed with udf_read_super is now prefixed with
udf_fill_super.
