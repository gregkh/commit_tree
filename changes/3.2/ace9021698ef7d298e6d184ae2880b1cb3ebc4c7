ARM: OMAP3: hwmod: fix variant registration and remove SmartReflex from common list

Commit d6504acd2125984c61dce24727dd3842d0144015 ("OMAP2+: hwmod:
remove OMAP_CHIP*") tests the inverse condition of what it should be
testing for the return value from omap_hwmod_register().  This causes
several IP blocks to not be registered on several OMAP3 family devices.

Fixing that bug also unmasked another bug, originally reported by
Chase Maupin <chase.maupin@ti.com> and then subsequently by Abhilash K
V <abhilash.kv@ti.com>, which caused SmartReflex IP blocks to be
registered on SoCs that don't support them.

Thanks to Russell King - ARM Linux <linux@arm.linux.org.uk> for comments
on a previous version of the patch.
