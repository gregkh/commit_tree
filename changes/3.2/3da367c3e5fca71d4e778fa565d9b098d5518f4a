vmscan: add block plug for page reclaim

per-task block plug can reduce block queue lock contention and increase
request merge.  Currently page reclaim doesn't support it.  I originally
thought page reclaim doesn't need it, because kswapd thread count is
limited and file cache write is done at flusher mostly.

When I test a workload with heavy swap in a 4-node machine, each CPU is
doing direct page reclaim and swap.  This causes block queue lock
contention.  In my test, without below patch, the CPU utilization is about
2% ~ 7%.  With the patch, the CPU utilization is about 1% ~ 3%.  Disk
throughput isn't changed.  This should improve normal kswapd write and
file cache write too (increase request merge for example), but might not
be so obvious as I explain above.
