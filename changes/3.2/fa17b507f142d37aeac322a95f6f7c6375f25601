sched: Wrap scheduler p->cpus_allowed access

This task is preparatory for the migrate_disable() implementation, but
stands on its own and provides a cleanup.

It currently only converts those sites required for task-placement.
Kosaki-san once mentioned replacing cpus_allowed with a proper
cpumask_t instead of the NR_CPUS sized array it currently is, that
would also require something like this.
