OMAP: Fix a BUG in l3 error handler.

With the current sequence of registering the irq and
assigning it to the app_irq, debug_irq driver variables,
there can be corner cases where the pending irq gets
triggered immediately after registering, handler gets called
resulting in a crash. So changed this sequence.
