vlan: Don't propagate flag changes on down interfaces.

When (de)configuring a vlan interface, the IFF_ALLMULTI ans IFF_PROMISC
flags are cleared or set on the underlying interface. So, if these flags
are changed on a vlan interface that is not up, the flags underlying
interface might be set or cleared twice.

Only propagating flag changes when a device is up makes sure this does
not happen. It also makes sure that an underlying device is not set to
promiscuous or allmulti mode for a vlan device that is down.
