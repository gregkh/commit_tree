tipc: Initialize peer session field of newly created link endpoint

Initializes the peer session number field of a newly created link
endpoint to an invalid value. This eliminates the remote possibility
that it will accidentally match the session number used by the peer
the first time the link is activated, and cause the link to ignore
a valid RESET message.
