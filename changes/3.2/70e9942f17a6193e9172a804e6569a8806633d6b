netfilter: nf_conntrack: make event callback registration per-netns

This patch fixes an oops that can be triggered following this recipe:

0) make sure nf_conntrack_netlink and nf_conntrack_ipv4 are loaded.
1) container is started.
2) connect to it via lxc-console.
3) generate some traffic with the container to create some conntrack
   entries in its table.
4) stop the container: you hit one oops because the conntrack table
   cleanup tries to report the destroy event to user-space but the
   per-netns nfnetlink socket has already gone (as the nfnetlink
   socket is per-netns but event callback registration is global).

To fix this situation, we make the ctnl_notifier per-netns so the
callback is registered/unregistered if the container is
created/destroyed.

Alex Bligh and Alexey Dobriyan originally proposed one small patch to
check if the nfnetlink socket is gone in nfnetlink_has_listeners,
but this is a very visited path for events, thus, it may reduce
performance and it looks a bit hackish to check for the nfnetlink
socket only to workaround this situation. As a result, I decided
to follow the bigger path choice, which seems to look nicer to me.
