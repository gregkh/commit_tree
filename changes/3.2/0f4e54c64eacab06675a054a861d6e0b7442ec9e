ARM: S3C64XX: Fix SoC identification for S3C64xx devices

The IS_SAMSUNG_CPU() macro works by comparing the CPU ID mask exactly with
the CPU ID. This was failing for S3C64xx SoCs as in order to support
identification of the exact device the mask covers both variants of the
chip, meaning that the test would always fail on S3C6410 devices. This in
turn caused the core GPIO subsystem to fail to identify the CPU and not
support any GPIOs, crippling the system.

As a minimally invasive fix change the test for the class to be done by
checking each implementation and oring them together.
