TTY: msm_serial, remove unneeded console set

It doesn't make sense to set console to uart_port in console->setup.
At that time the console is set by uart_add_one_port already.

The call chain looked like:
uart_add_one_port()
  uport->cons = drv->cons;   <= once
  uart_configure_port()
    register_console()
     console->setup()
       port->cons = co;      <= second time
