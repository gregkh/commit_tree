[SCSI] bnx2fc: Fix NULL pointer deref during arm_cq.

There exists a race condition between CQ doorbell unmap and IO completion path
that arms the CQ which causes a NULL dereference. Protect the ctx_base with
cq_lock to avoid this. Also, wait for the CQ doorbell to be successfully mapped
before arming the CQ.

Also, do not count uncolicited CQ completions for free_sqes.
