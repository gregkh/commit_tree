igb: Make Tx budget for NAPI user adjustable

This change is to make the NAPI budget limits for transmit
adjustable.  Currently they are only set to 128, and when
the changes/improvements to NAPI occur to allow for adjustability,
it would be possible to tune the value for optimal
performance with applications such as routing.

v2: remove tie between NAPI and interrupt moderation
    fix work limit define name (s/IXGBE/IGB/)
    Update patch description to better reflect patch
