pinctrl: get_group_pins() const fixes

get_group_pins() "returns" a pointer to an array of const objects, through
a pointer parameter. Fix the prototype so what's pointed at by the returned
pointer is const, rather than the function parameter being const.

This also allows the removal of a cast in each of the two current pinmux
drivers.
