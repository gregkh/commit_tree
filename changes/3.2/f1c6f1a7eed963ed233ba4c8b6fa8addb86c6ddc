sched: Set the command name of the idle tasks in SMP kernels

In UP systems, the idle task is initialized using the init_task
structure from which the command name is taken (currently "swapper").

In SMP systems, one idle task per CPU is forked by the worker thread
from which the task structure is copied. The command name is, therefore,
"kworker/0:0" or "kworker/0:1", if not updated. Since such update was
lacking, all idle tasks in SMP systems were incorrectly named. This
longtime bug was not discovered immediately, because there is no /proc/0
entry - the bug only becomes apparent when tracing is enabled.

This patch sets the command name of the idle tasks in SMP systems to the
name that is used in the INIT_TASK structure suffixed by a slash and the
number of the CPU.
