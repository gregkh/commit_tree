rapidio/tsi721: fix mailbox resource reporting

Bug fix for Tsi721 RapidIO mport driver: Tsi721 supports four RapidIO
mailboxes (MBOX0 - MBOX3) as defined by RapidIO specification.  Mailbox
resources has to be properly reported to allow use of all available
mailboxes (initial version reports only MBOX0).
