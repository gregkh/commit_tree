RDMA/cxgb3: Serialize calls to CQ's comp_handler

iw_cxgb3 has a potential problem where a CQ's comp_handler can get
called simultaneously from different places in iw_cxgb3 driver.  This
does not comply with Documentation/infiniband/core_locking.txt, which
states that at a given point of time, there should be only one
callback per CQ should be active.

Such problem was reported by Parav Pandit <Parav.Pandit@Emulex.Com>
for iw_cxgb4 driver.  Based on discussion between Parav Pandit and
Steve Wise, this patch fixes the above problem by serializing the
calls to a CQ's comp_handler using a spin_lock.
