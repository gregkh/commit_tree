virtio: console: wait for first console port for early console output

On s390 I have seen some random

"Warning: unable to open an initial console"

boot failure. Turns out that tty_open fails, because the
hvc_alloc was not yet done. In former times this could not happen,
since the probe function automatically called hvc_alloc. With newer
versions (multiport) some host<->guest interaction is required
before hvc_alloc is called. This might be too late, especially if
an initramfs is involved. Lets use a completion if we have
multiport and an early console.

[Amit:
  * Use NULL instead of 0 for pointer comparison
  * Rename 'port_added' to 'early_console_added'
  * Re-format, re-word commit message
  * Rebase patch on top of current queue]
