hwmon: (pmbus) Don't return errors from driver remove functions

Driver remove functions have an error return value, but rarely return an error
in practice. If a driver does return an error from its remove function, the
driver won't be unloaded and is expected to stay alive.

pmbus_do_remove() is defined as returning an int, but always returns 0 (no
error). Calling code passes that return value on to high level driver
remove functions, but does not evaluate it and removes driver data even if
pmbus_do_remove() returned an error (which it in practice never does). Even if
this code could never cause a real problem, it is nevertheless conceptually
wrong.

To reduce confusion and simplify the code, change pmbus_do_remove() to be a void
function, and have PMBus client drivers always return zero in their driver
remove functions.
