sky2: fix hang on shutdown (and other irq issues)

There are several problems with recent change to how IRQ's are setup.
   * synchronize_irq in sky2_shutdown would hang because there
     was no IRQ setup.
   * when device was set to down, some IRQ bits left enabled so a
     hardware error would produce IRQ with no handler
   * quick link on Optima chip set was enabled without handler
   * suspend/resume would leave IRQ on with no handler if device
     was down
