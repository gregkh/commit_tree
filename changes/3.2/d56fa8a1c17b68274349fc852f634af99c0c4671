GFS2: Call do_strip() directly from recursive_scan()

The recursive_scan() function only ever takes a single "bc"
argument, so we might as well just call do_strip() directly
from resource_scan() rather than pass it in as an argument.

Also the "data" argument is always a struct strip_mine, so
we can pass that in, rather than using a void pointer.

This also moves do_strip() ahead of recursive_scan() so that
we don't need to add a prototype.
