ocfs2: make direntry invalid when deleting it

When we deleting a direntry from a directory, if it's the first in a block we
invalid it by setting inode to 0; otherwise, we merge the deleted one to the
prior and contiguous direntry. And we don't truncate directories.

There is a problem for the later case since inode is not set to 0.
This problem happens when the caller passes a file position as parameter to
ocfs2_dir_foreach_blk(). If the position happens to point to a stale(not
the first, deleted in betweens of ocfs2_dir_foreach_blk()s) direntry, we are
not able to recognize its staleness. So that we treat it as a live one wrongly.

The fix is to set inode to 0 in both cases indicating the direntry is stale.
This won't introduce additional IOs.
