PM / Clocks: Only disable enabled clocks in pm_clk_suspend()

Refrain from running clk_disable() on clocks that
have not been enabled. A typical case when this can
happen is during Suspend-to-RAM for devices that have
no driver associated with them. In such case the clock
may be in default ACQUIRED state.

Without this patch the sh7372 Mackerel board crashes
in __clk_disable() during Suspend-to-RAM with:
"Trying to disable clock 0xdeadbeef with 0 usecount"
This happens for the CEU device which is added during
boot. The test case has no CEU driver included in the
kernel configuration. Needed for v3.2-rc1.
