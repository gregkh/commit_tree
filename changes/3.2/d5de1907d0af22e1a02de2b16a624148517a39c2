mtd: provide an alias for the redboot module name

parse_mtd_partitions takes a list of partition types; if the driver
isn't loaded, it attempts to load it, and then it grabs the partition
parser.  For redboot, the module name is "redboot.ko", while the parser
name is "RedBoot".  Since modprobe is case-sensitive, attempting to
modprobe "RedBoot" will never work.  I suspect the embedded systems that
make use of redboot just always manually loaded redboot prior to loading
their specific nand chip drivers (or statically compiled it in).
