rcu: Dump local stack if cannot dump all CPUs' stacks

The trigger_all_cpu_backtrace() function is a no-op in architectures that
do not define arch_trigger_all_cpu_backtrace.  On such architectures, RCU
CPU stall warning messages contain no stack trace information, which makes
debugging quite difficult.  This commit therefore substitutes dump_stack()
for architectures that do not define arch_trigger_all_cpu_backtrace,
so that at least the local CPU's stack is dumped as part of the RCU CPU
stall warning message.
