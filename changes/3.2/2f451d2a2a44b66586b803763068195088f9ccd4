ALSA: hda - Re-enable the check NO_PRESENCE misc bit

We disabled the check of NO_PRESENCE bit of the default pin-config
in commit f4419172 temporarily.  One problem was that the first
implementation was wrong -- the bit after the shift must be checked.
However, this would still give many regressions on machines with broken
BIOS.  They set this bit wrongly even on active pins.

A workaround is to check whether all pins contain this bit.  As far as
I've checked, broken BIOSen set this bit on all pins, no matter whether
active or not.  In such a case, the driver should ignore this bit check.
