PCI / ACPI: Make acpiphp ignore root bridges using PCIe native hotplug

If the kernel has requested control of the PCIe native hotplug
feature for a given root complex, the acpiphp driver should not try
to handle that root complex and it should leave it to pciehp.
Failing to do so causes problems to happen if acpiphp is loaded
before pciehp on such systems.

To address this issue make find_root_bridges() ignore PCIe root
complexes with PCIe native hotplug enabled and make add_bridge()
return error code if PCIe native hotplug is enabled for the given
root port.  This causes acpiphp to refuse to load if PCIe native
hotplug is enabled for all complexes and to refuse binding to
the root complexes with PCIe native hotplug is enabled.
