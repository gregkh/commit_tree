KVM: PPC: fix kvmppc_start_thread() for CONFIG_SMP=N

Currently kvmppc_start_thread() tries to wake other SMT threads via
xics_wake_cpu().  Unfortunately xics_wake_cpu only exists when
CONFIG_SMP=Y so when compiling with CONFIG_SMP=N we get:

  arch/powerpc/kvm/built-in.o: In function `.kvmppc_start_thread':
  book3s_hv.c:(.text+0xa1e0): undefined reference to `.xics_wake_cpu'

The following should be fine since kvmppc_start_thread() shouldn't
called to start non-zero threads when SMP=N since threads_per_core=1.
