Btrfs: fix num_workers_starting bug and other bugs in async thread

Al pointed out we have some random problems with the way we account for
num_workers_starting in the async thread stuff.  First of all we need to make
sure to decrement num_workers_starting if we fail to start the worker, so make
__btrfs_start_workers do this.  Also fix __btrfs_start_workers so that it
doesn't call btrfs_stop_workers(), there is no point in stopping everybody if we
failed to create a worker.  Also check_pending_worker_creates needs to call
__btrfs_start_work in it's work function since it already increments
num_workers_starting.

People only start one worker at a time, so get rid of the num_workers argument
everywhere, and make btrfs_queue_worker a void since it will always succeed.
Thanks,
