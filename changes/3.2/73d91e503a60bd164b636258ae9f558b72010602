[SCSI] lpfc 8.3.27: Miscellanous logic and interface fixes

Miscellanous logic and interface fixes

- Fix lpfc_init_vfi_cmpl to check the interface type for interface type 0
  before parsing the results.
- Cast uint32_t values that are multiplied to uint64_t before the
  multiplication.
- Instead of "break" statement when PCI read returned error, use the goto
  statement to the end of the routine after setting return value
- moved the msleep(10) to the beginning of the wait loop for checking the
  SLIPort_Status register
- Added the code to follow the existing wait for SLIPort_Status register RDY,
  ERR, and RN bits to be set by the port before proceeding to perform PCI
  function reset.
- Do not override ulpCt_h and ulpCt_l for SLI 4 ports.
- For vport delete, call lpfc_nlp_put when the vport's vpi state is not
  marked with VPI_REGISTERED.
- Added missed fields into the driver's Controller Attributes Structure
- Changed ringing EQ/CQ/RQ doorbell register to be dependent on the size
  of the queue.
- Return -EACCES in issue_reset if cfg_enable_hba_reset is zero.
- Added new logging flag LOG_FCP_UNDER 0x00040000 to qualify underrun logging.
- Add a check in the fabric name display routine to display 0 if the port
  state is <= FLOGI.
- Add a check to the switch statement in lpfc_decode_firmware_rev to check
  for an 'X'.
