ACPI: Fix possible recursive locking in hwregs.c

Calling pm-suspend might trigger a recursive lock in it's code path.
In function acpi_hw_clear_acpi_status, acpi_os_acquire_lock holds
the lock acpi_gbl_hardware_lock before calling acpi_hw_register_write(),
then without releasing acpi_gbl_hardware_lock, this function calls
acpi_ev_walk_gpe_list, which tries to hold acpi_gbl_gpe_lock.
Both acpi_gbl_hardware_lock and acpi_gbl_gpe_lock are at same
lock-class and which might cause lock recursion deadlock.

Following patch fixes this scenario by just releasing
acpi_gbl_hardware_lock before calling acpi_ev_walk_gpe_list.
