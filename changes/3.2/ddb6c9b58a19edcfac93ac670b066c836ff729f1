locking, rwsem: Annotate inner lock as raw

There is no reason to allow the lock protecting rwsems (the
ownerless variant) to be preemptible on -rt. Convert it to raw.

In mainline this change documents the low level nature of
the lock - otherwise there's no functional difference. Lockdep
and Sparse checking will work as usual.
