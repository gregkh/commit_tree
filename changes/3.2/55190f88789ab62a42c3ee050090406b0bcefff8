powerpc: Add skeleton PowerNV platform

This adds a skeletton for the new Power "Non Virtualized"
platform which will be used by machines supporting running
without an hypervisor, for example in order to run KVM.

These machines will be using a new firmware called OPAL
for which the support will be provided by later patches.

The PowerNV platform is intended to be also usable under
the BML environment used internally for early CPU bringup
which is why the code also supports using RTAS instead of
OPAL in various places.
