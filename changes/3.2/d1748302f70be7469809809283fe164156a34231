clockevents: Make minimum delay adjustments configurable

The automatic increase of the min_delta_ns of a clockevents device
should be done in the clockevents code as the minimum delay is an
attribute of the clockevents device.

In addition not all architectures want the automatic adjustment, on a
massively virtualized system it can happen that the programming of a
clock event fails several times in a row because the virtual cpu has
been rescheduled quickly enough. In that case the minimum delay will
erroneously be increased with no way back. The new config symbol
GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS_MIN_ADJUST is used to enable the automatic
adjustment. The config option is selected only for x86.
