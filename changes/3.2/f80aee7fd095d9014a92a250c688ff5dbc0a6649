Input: lm8323 - wrap suspend and resume in CONFIG_PM_SLEEP

CONFIG_PM is defined when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP or CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is defined,
however suspend and resume methods are only valid in the context of
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP. If only CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is defined we get the following
warning (courtesy of Geerts randconfig builds):

	lm8323.c: warning: 'lm8323_resume' defined but not used
