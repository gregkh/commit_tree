of/irq: of_irq_find_parent: check for parent equal to child

An interrupt controller may often implicitly inherit itself from a parent
node when in fact the controller is the interrupt root controller. Guard
against the case of child == parent and return NULL in this case.

This can also be fixed by adding an explicit "interrupt-parent;" to a root
interrupt controller node.

Based on code from Grant Likely.
