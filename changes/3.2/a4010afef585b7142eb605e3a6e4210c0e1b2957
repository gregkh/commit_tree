e1000: convert hardware management from timers to threads

Thomas Gleixner (tglx) reported that e1000 was delaying for many milliseconds
(using mdelay) from inside timer/interrupt context.  None of these paths are
performance critical and can be moved into threads/work items.  This patch
implements the work items and the next patch changes the mdelays to msleeps.
