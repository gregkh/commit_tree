igb: Make first and tx_buffer_info->next_to_watch into pointers

This change converts two tx_buffer_info index values into pointers.  The
advantage to this is that we reduce unnecessary computations and in the case
of next_to_watch we get an added bonus of the value being able to provide
additional information as a NULL value indicates it is unset versus a 0 not
having any meaning for the index value.
