atmel/spi: fix missing probe

Commit 940ab889 "drivercore: Add helper macro for platform_driver boilerplate"
converted this driver to use module_platform_driver, but due to the use
of platform_driver_probe(), this resulted in the call to atmel_spi_probe being
lost. Place the call to this function into the driver structure.

fix section missmatch

atmel_spi_probe is marked __init where it's supposed to be __devinit
atmel_spi_remove is marked __exit where it's supposed to be __devexit
