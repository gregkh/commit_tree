nfsd4: extend state lock over seqid replay logic

There are currently a couple races in the seqid replay code: a
retransmission could come while we're still encoding the original reply,
or a new seqid-mutating call could come as we're encoding a replay.

So, extend the state lock over the encoding (both encoding of a replayed
reply and caching of the original encoded reply).

I really hate doing this, and previously added the stateowner
reference-counting code to avoid it (which was insufficient)--but I
don't see a less complicated alternative at the moment.
