PM / QoS: Set cpu_dma_pm_qos->name

Since commit 4a31a334, the name of this misc device is not initialized,
which leads to a funny device named /dev/(null) being created and
/proc/misc containing an entry with just a number but no name. The latter
leads to complaints by cryptsetup, which caused me to investigate this
matter.
