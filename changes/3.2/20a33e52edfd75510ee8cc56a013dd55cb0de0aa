wl12xx: ignore sched scan match sets without SSID

For now, cfg80211 only support match sets with SSIDs, but in the
future more parameters will be added.  This patch ignores eventual
matches that do not contain SSIDs in preparation for the future.  This
change also affects the case where broadcast SSIDs are used.  Matching
a broadcast SSID will match everything, so they can be ignored.
