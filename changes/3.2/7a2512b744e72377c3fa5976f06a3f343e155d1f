[S390] incorrect note program header

'readelf -n' on the s390 vmlinux file generates lots of warnings about
corrupt notes. The reason is that the 'NOTE' program header has incorrect
file and memory sizes. The problem is that the section following the
NOTES section do not switch to a different phdr and they get added to
the NOTE program section. Add a dummy entry to the linker script that
switches to the data phdr before the start of the RODATA section.
