powerpc: remove non-required uses of include <linux/module.h>

None of the files touched here are modules, and they are not
exporting any symbols either -- so there is no need to be including
the module.h.  Builds of all the files remains successful.

Even kernel/module.c does not need to include it, since it includes
linux/moduleloader.h instead.
