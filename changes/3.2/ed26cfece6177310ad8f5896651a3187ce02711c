[SCSI] libfc: cache align struct fc_fcp_pkt fields

Re-arrange its fields to avoid padding and have better
cacheline alignments.

Removed not used start_time, end_time and last_pkt_time
fields.

This all reduced this struct size to 448 from 480 and
that also reduced one cacheline on x86_64 beside
eliminating 8 pads. However kept logical fields together.
