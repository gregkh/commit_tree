ethtool: Correct description of 'max_coalesced_frames' fields

The current descriptions state that these fields specify 'How many
packets to delay ... after a packet ...' which implies that the
hardware should wait for (max_coalesced_frames + 1) completions before
generating an interrupt.  It is also stated that setting both this
field and the corresponding 'coalesce_usecs' field to 0 is invalid.
Together, this implies that the hardware must always be configured
to delay a completion IRQ for at least 1 usec or 1 more completion.

I believe that the addition of 1 is not intended, and David Miller
confirms that the original implementation (in tg3) does not do this.
Clarify the descriptions of these fields to avoid this interpretation.
