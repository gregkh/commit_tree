xfs: rename xfs_bmapi to xfs_bmapi_write

Now that all the read-only users of xfs_bmapi have been converted to
use xfs_bmapi_read(), we can remove all the read-only handling cases
from xfs_bmapi().

Once this is done, rename xfs_bmapi to xfs_bmapi_write to reflect
the fact it is for allocation only. This enables us to kill the
XFS_BMAPI_WRITE flag as well.

Also clean up xfs_bmapi_write to the style used in the newly added
xfs_bmapi_read/delay functions.
