powerpc: remove superfluous PageTail checks on the pte gup_fast

This part of gup_fast doesn't seem capable of handling hugetlbfs ptes,
those should be handled by gup_hugepd only, so these checks are
superfluous.

Plus if this wasn't a noop, it would have oopsed because, the insistence
of using the speculative refcounting would trigger a VM_BUG_ON if a tail
page was encountered in the page_cache_get_speculative().
