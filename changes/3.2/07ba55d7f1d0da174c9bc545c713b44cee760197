nl80211/mac80211: allow adding TDLS peers as stations

When adding a TDLS peer STA, mark it with a new flag in both nl80211 and
mac80211. Before adding a peer, make sure the wiphy supports TDLS and
our operating mode is appropriate (managed).

In addition, make sure all peers are removed on disassociation.

A TDLS peer is first added just before link setup is initiated. In later
setup stages we have more info about peer supported rates, capabilities,
etc. This info is reported via nl80211_set_station().
