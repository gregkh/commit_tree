HID: wiimote: Add missing extension DRM handlers

If an extension is connected the wiimote may report data though DRMs that
contain extension data. This adds handlers for these DRMs but discards extension
data since we do not support it, yet.
It prints a warning to kernel log if an unhandled report is catched. Since we
handle all requests now, this should never happen, though.
