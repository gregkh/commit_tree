ocfs2: Avoid livelock in ocfs2_readpage()

When someone writes to an inode, readers accessing the same inode via
ocfs2_readpage() just busyloop trying to get ip_alloc_sem because
do_generic_file_read() looks up the page again and retries ->readpage()
when previous attempt failed with AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE. When there are enough
readers, they can occupy all CPUs and in non-preempt kernel the system is
deadlocked because writer holding ip_alloc_sem is never run to release the
semaphore. Fix the problem by making reader block on ip_alloc_sem to break
the busy loop.
