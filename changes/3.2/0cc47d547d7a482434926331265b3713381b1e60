usb/xhci: remove CONFIG_PCI in xhci.c's probe function

This removes the need of ifdefs within the init function and with it the
headache about the correct clean without bus X but with bus/platform Y &
Z.
xhci-pci is only compiled if CONFIG_PCI is selected which can be
de-selected now without trouble. For now the result is kinda useless
because we have no other glue code. However, since nobody is using
USB_ARCH_HAS_XHCI then it should not be an issue :)
