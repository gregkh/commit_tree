firewire: ohci: Add support for TSB41BA3D phy

This patch implements a work around for the Texas Instruments PHY
TSB41BA3D.  This phy has a bug at least in combination with the TI LLCs
TSB82AA2B and TSB12LV26.  The selfid coming from the locally connected
phy is not propagated into the selfid buffer of the OHCI (see
http://www.ti.com/litv/pdf/sllz059 for details).  The main idea is to
construct the selfid ourselves.
