Add ath6kl cleaned up driver

Last May we started working on cleaning up ath6kl driver which is
currently in staging. The work has happened in a separate
ath6kl-cleanup tree:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/kvalo/ath6kl-cleanup.git;a=summary

After over 1100 (!) patches we have now reached a state where I would
like to start discussing about pushing the driver to the wireless
trees and replacing the staging driver.

The driver is now a lot smaller and looks like a proper Linux driver.
The size of the driver (measured with simple wc -l) dropped from 49
kLOC to 18 kLOC and the number of the .c and .h files dropped from 107
to 22. Most importantly the number of subdirectories reduced from 26
to zero :)

There are two remaining checkpatch warnings in the driver which we
decided to omit for now:

drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/debug.c:31:
  WARNING: printk() should include KERN_ facility level
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/sdio.c:527:
  WARNING: msleep < 20ms can sleep for up to 20ms;
  see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt

The driver has endian annotations for all the hardware specific
structures and there are no sparse errors. Unfortunately I don't have
any big endian hardware to test that right now.

We have been testing the driver both on x86 and arm platforms. The
code is also compiled with sparc and parisc cross compilers.

Notable missing features compared to the current staging driver are:

o HCI over SDIO support
o nl80211 testmode
o firmware logging
o suspend support

Testmode, firmware logging and suspend support will be added soon. HCI
over SDIO support will be more difficult as the HCI driver needs to
share code with the wifi driver. This is something we need to research
more.

Also I want to point out the changes I did for signed endian support.
As I wasn't able to find any support for signed endian annotations I
decided to follow what NTFS has done and added my own. Grep for sle16
and sle32, especially from wmi.h.

Various people have been working on the cleanup, the hall of
fame based on number of patches is:
