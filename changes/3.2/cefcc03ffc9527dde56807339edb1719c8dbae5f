ASoC: Provide a more complete DMA driver stub

Allow userspace applications to do more parameter setting by providing a
more complete stub DMA driver specifying a wildcard set of formats and
channels and essentially random values for the DMA parameters. This is
required for useful runtime operation of the dummy DMA driver until we
are able to figure out how to power up links and do hw_params() from DAPM.

Sending to stable as without this the dummy driver is not terribly
useful.
