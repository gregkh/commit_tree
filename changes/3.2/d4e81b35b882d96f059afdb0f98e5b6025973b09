[S390] allow all addressing modes

The user space program can change its addressing mode between the
24-bit, 31-bit and the 64-bit mode if the kernel is 64 bit. Currently
the kernel always forces the standard amode on signal delivery and
signal return and on ptrace: 64-bit for a 64-bit process, 31-bit for
a compat process and 31-bit kernels. Change the signal and ptrace code
to allow the full range of addressing modes. Signal handlers are
run in the standard addressing mode for the process.

One caveat is that even an 31-bit compat process can switch to the
64-bit mode. The next signal will switch back into the 31-bit mode
and there is no room in the 31-bit compat signal frame to store the
information that the program came from the 64-bit mode.
