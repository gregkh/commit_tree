staging: usbip: fix up api changes that broke windows clients

Revert changes in definitions that were submitted on May 11 2011 and
committed on June 7 2011. No reason for the change in these values was
given in the patch comment, it broke compatibility with older
versions, and was difficult to detect by the simultaneous move of the
lines of code.
