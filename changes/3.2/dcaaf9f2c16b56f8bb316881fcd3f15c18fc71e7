ALSA: usb-audio - Fix the missing volume quirks at delayed init

In the recent usb-audio driver, the initialization of volume ranges
may be delayed when the device doesn't respond well at the probing time.
But the volume quirks for certain devices are applied only in
mixer_ctl_feature_info() thus only at the very first probe and will be
missing when the volume range is initialized later.

This patch moves the volume quirk code to be always called from the
volume-range extraction (get_min_max()), so that the quirks are properly
applied in the later init time.
