ARM: OMAP: rx51: fix USB

Commit 10299e2e4e3ed3b16503d4e04edd48b33083f4e2 (ARM: RX-51:
Enable isp1704 power on/off) added power management for isp1704.

However, the transceiver should be powered on by default,
otherwise USB doesn't work at all for networking during
boot.

All kernels after v3.0 are affected.
