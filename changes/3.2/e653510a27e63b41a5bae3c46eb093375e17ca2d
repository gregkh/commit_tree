ALSA: snd-usb-caiaq: Add support for Maschine

This adds partial support for the Maschine controller by Native Instruments.
Supported now are the 1x1 MIDI interface and the 41 buttons, 11 endless
rotary encoders, and 16 pressure-sensitive drum pads. Still to work on are the
dimmable LEDs and the two monochrome screens.
