mtd: nand: multi-line comment style fixups

Artem: while on it, do other commentaries clean-ups:
1. Start one-line comments with capital letter and no dot at the end
2. Turn sparse multi-line comments into one-line comments
3. Change "phrase ?" to "phrase?" and the same with "!".
4. Remove tabs from the kerneldoc parameters comments - they are mixed
   with tabs often, and inconsistent.
5. Put dot at the end of descriptions in kerneldoc comments.
6. Some other small commentaries clean-ups
