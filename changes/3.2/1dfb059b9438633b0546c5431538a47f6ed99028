thp: reduce khugepaged freezing latency

khugepaged can sometimes cause suspend to fail, requiring that the user
retry the suspend operation.

Use wait_event_freezable_timeout() instead of
schedule_timeout_interruptible() to avoid missing freezer wakeups.  A
try_to_freeze() would have been needed in the khugepaged_alloc_hugepage
tight loop too in case of the allocation failing repeatedly, and
wait_event_freezable_timeout will provide it too.

khugepaged would still freeze just fine by trying again the next minute
but it's better if it freezes immediately.
