TTY: serial, move 68360 driver to staging

This driver has been broken at least since 2008. At that time,
a88487c79b (Fix compile errors in SGI console drivers) broke this
driver completely.

And since nobody noticed for the past 3 years, move it into staging. I
think this will rot there and we will throw it away completely after
some time. Or maybe someone will volunteer to fix it ;).
