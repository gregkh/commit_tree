stmmac: Stop advertising 1000Base capabilties for non GMII iface (V4).

This patch stops advertising 1000Base capablities if GMAC is either
configured for MII or RMII mode and on board there is a GPHY plugged on.
Without this patch if an GBit switch is connected on MII interface,
Ethernet stops working at all.
