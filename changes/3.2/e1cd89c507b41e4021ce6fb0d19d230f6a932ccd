[SCSI] qla4xxx: a small loop fix

When the qla4xxx_get_fwddb_entry returns QLA_ERROR
the nex_idx is not updated,
      for (idx = 0; idx < max_ddbs; idx = next_idx) {
                ret = qla4xxx_get_fwddb_entry(ha, idx, NULL, 0, NULL,
                                              &next_idx, &state, &conn_err,
                                                NULL, NULL);
                if (ret == QLA_ERROR)
                        continue;

This means there is a risk that the 'idx < max_ddbs' condition will never
met and the loop will loop forever.
Fix this by explicitly increasing the next_idx in the error condition.

Maybe a break instead of continue is more appropriate, leaving the decision
on the qlogic maintainer.
