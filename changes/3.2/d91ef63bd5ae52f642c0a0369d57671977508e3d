arm: remove several unnecessary module.h include instances

Building these files does not reveal a hidden need for
any of these.  Since module.h brings in the whole kitchen
sink, it just needlessly adds 30k+ lines to the cpp burden.

There are probably lots more, but ARM files of mach-* and plat-*
don't get coverage via a simple yesconfig build.  They will have
to be cleaned up and tested via using their respective configs.
