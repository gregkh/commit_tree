regulator: Add driver for gpio-controlled regulators

This patch adds support for regulators that can be controlled via gpios.

Examples for such regulators are the TI-tps65024x voltage regulators
with 4 fixed and 1 runtime-switchable voltage regulators
or the TI-bq240XX charger regulators.

The number of controlling gpios is not limited, the mapping between
voltage/current and target gpio state is done via the states map
and the driver can be used for either voltage or current regulators.

A mapping for a regulator with two GPIOs could look like:

gpios = {
	{ .gpio = GPIO1, .flags = GPIOF_OUT_INIT_HIGH, .label = "gpio name 1" },
	{ .gpio = GPIO2, .flags = GPIOF_OUT_INIT_LOW,  .label = "gpio name 2" },
}

The flags element of the gpios array determines the initial state of
the gpio, set during probe. The initial state of the regulator is also
calculated from these values

states = {
	{ .value = volt_or_cur1, .gpios = (0 << 1) | (0 << 0) },
	{ .value = volt_or_cur2, .gpios = (0 << 1) | (1 << 0) },
	{ .value = volt_or_cur3, .gpios = (1 << 1) | (0 << 0) },
	{ .value = volt_or_cur4, .gpios = (1 << 1) | (1 << 0) },
}

The target-state for the n-th gpio is determined by the n-th bit
in the bitfield of the target-value.
