KVM: Fix simultaneous NMIs

If simultaneous NMIs happen, we're supposed to queue the second
and next (collapsing them), but currently we sometimes collapse
the second into the first.

Fix by using a counter for pending NMIs instead of a bool; since
the counter limit depends on whether the processor is currently
in an NMI handler, which can only be checked in vcpu context
(via the NMI mask), we add a new KVM_REQ_NMI to request recalculation
of the counter.
