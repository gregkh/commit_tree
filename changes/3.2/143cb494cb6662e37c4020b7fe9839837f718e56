fs: add module.h to files that were implicitly using it

Some files were using the complete module.h infrastructure without
actually including the header at all.  Fix them up in advance so
once the implicit presence is removed, we won't get failures like this:

  CC [M]  fs/nfsd/nfssvc.o
fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c: In function 'nfsd_create_serv':
fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:335: error: 'THIS_MODULE' undeclared (first use in this function)
fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:335: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:335: error: for each function it appears in.)
fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c: In function 'nfsd':
fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c:555: error: implicit declaration of function 'module_put_and_exit'
make[3]: *** [fs/nfsd/nfssvc.o] Error 1
