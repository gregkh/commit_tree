batman-adv: hash_add() has to discriminate on the return value

hash_add() returns 0 on success while returns -1 either on error and on
entry already present. The caller could use such information to select
its behaviour. For this reason it is useful that hash_add() returns -1
in case on error and returns 1 in case of entry already present.
