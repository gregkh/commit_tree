ASoC: tpa6130a2: Remove model_id from platform data

The model_id is no longer needed within the platform_data
for the TPA driver since the model of TPA specified
with the device name (tpa6130a2/tpa6140a2).

Also update rx51 (the only affected user) to use the device name rather
than platform data.
