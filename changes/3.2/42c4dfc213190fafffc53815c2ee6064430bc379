cifs: turn read_from_socket into a wrapper around a vectorized version

Eventually we'll want to allow cifsd to read data directly into the
pagecache. In order to do that we'll need a routine that can take a
kvec array and pass that directly to kernel_recvmsg.

Unfortunately though, the kernel's recvmsg routines modify the kvec
array that gets passed in, so we need to use a copy of the kvec array
and refresh that copy on each pass through the loop.
