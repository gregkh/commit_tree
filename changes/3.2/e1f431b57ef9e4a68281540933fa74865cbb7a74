ARM: perf: refactor event mapping

Currently mapping an event type to a hardware configuration value
depends on the data being pointed to from struct arm_pmu. These fields
(cache_map, event_map, raw_event_mask) are currently specific to CPU
PMUs, and do not serve the general case well.

This patch replaces the event map pointers on struct arm_pmu with a new
'map_event' function pointer. Small shim functions are used to reuse
the existing common code.
