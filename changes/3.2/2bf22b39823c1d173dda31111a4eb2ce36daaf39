mmc: core: add workaround for controllers with broken multiblock reads

Due to hardware bugs, some MMC host controllers don't support
multiple-block reads[1].  To resolve, add a new MMC capability flag,
MMC_CAP2_NO_MULTI_READ, which can be set by affected host controller
drivers.  When this capability is set, all reads will be issued one
sector at a time.

1. See for example Advisory 2.1.1.128 "MMC: Multiple Block Read
Operation Issue" in _OMAP3530/3525/3515/3503 Silicon Errata_
