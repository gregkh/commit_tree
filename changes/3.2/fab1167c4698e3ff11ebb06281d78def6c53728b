x86, vsyscall: Add missing <asm/fixmap.h> to arch/x86/mm/fault.c

arch/x86/mm/fault.c now depend on having the symbol VSYSCALL_START
defined, which is best handled by including <asm/fixmap.h> (it isn't
unreasonable we may want other fixed addresses in this file in the
future, and so it is cleaner than including <asm/vsyscall.h>
directly.)

This addresses an x86-64 allnoconfig build failure.  On other
configurations it was masked by an indirect path:

<asm/smp.h> -> <asm/apic.h> -> <asm/fixmap.h> -> <asm/vsyscall.h>

... however, the first such include is conditional on CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC.
