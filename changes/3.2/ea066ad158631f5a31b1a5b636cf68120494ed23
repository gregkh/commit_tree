xen: netback: convert to SKB paged frag API.

netback currently uses frag->page to store a temporary index reference while
processing incoming requests. Since frag->page is to become opaque switch
instead to using page_offset. Add a wrapper to tidy this up and propagate the
fact that the indexes are only u16 through the code (this was already true in
practice but unsigned long and in were inconsistently used as variable and
parameter types)
