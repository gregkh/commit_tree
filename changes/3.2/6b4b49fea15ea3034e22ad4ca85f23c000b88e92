Input: synaptics - process finger (<=5) transitions

Synaptics image sensor touchpads track up to 5 fingers, but only report 2.
They use a special "TYPE=2" (AGM-CONTACT) packet type that reports
the number of tracked fingers and which finger is reported in the SGM
and AGM packets.

With this new packet type, it is possible to tell userspace when 4 or 5
fingers are touching.
