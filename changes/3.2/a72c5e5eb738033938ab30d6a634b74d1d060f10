[SCSI] genhd: add a new attribute "alias" in gendisk

This patch allows the user to set an "alias" of the disk via sysfs interface.

This patch only adds a new attribute "alias" in gendisk structure.
To show the alias instead of the device name in kernel messages,
we need to revise printk messages and use alias_name() in them.

Example:
(current) printk("disk name is %s\n", disk->disk_name);
(new)     printk("disk name is %s\n", alias_name(disk));

Users can use alphabets, numbers, '-' and '_' in "alias" attribute. A disk can
have an "alias" which length is up to 255 bytes. This attribute is write-once.
