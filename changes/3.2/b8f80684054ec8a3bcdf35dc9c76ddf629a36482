mtd: nand: move NAND_CREATE_EMPTY_BBT flag

The NAND_CREATE_EMPTY_BBT flag was added by commit:
  453281a973c10bce941b240d1c654d536623b16b
  mtd: nand: introduce NAND_CREATE_EMPTY_BBT
This flag is not used within the kernel and not explained well, so I
took the liberty to edit its comments.

Also, this is a BBT-related flag (and closely tied with NAND_BBT_CREATE)
so I'm moving it to bbm.h next to NAND_BBT_CREATE, thus requiring that
we use the flag in nand_chip.bbt_options, *not* in nand_chip.options.
