ARM: zImage: make sure appended DTB doesn't get overwritten by kernel .bss

The appended DTB gets relocated with the decompressor code to get out
of the way of the decompressed kernel.  However the kernel's .bss section
may be larger than the relocated code and data, and then the DTB gets
overwritten.  Let's make sure the relocation takes care of moving zImage
far enough so no such conflict with .bss occurs.

Thanks to Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com> for figuring out this issue.

While at it, let's clean up the code a bit so that the wont_overwrite
symbol is used while determining if a conflict exists, making the above
change more precise as well as eliminating some ARM/THUMB alternates.
