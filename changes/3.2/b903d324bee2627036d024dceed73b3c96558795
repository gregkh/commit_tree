ipv6: tcp: fix TCLASS value in ACK messages sent from TIME_WAIT

commit 66b13d99d96a (ipv4: tcp: fix TOS value in ACK messages sent from
TIME_WAIT) fixed IPv4 only.

This part is for the IPv6 side, adding a tclass param to ip6_xmit()

We alias tw_tclass and tw_tos, if socket family is INET6.

[ if sockets is ipv4-mapped, only IP_TOS socket option is used to fill
TOS field, TCLASS is not taken into account ]
