ARM: 7116/1: debug: provide dummy default option for DEBUG_LL UART choice

Defaulting to DEBUG_ICEDCC will cause systems to hang during boot unless
a hardware debugger is listening to the debug comms. channel.

This patch adds a dummy UART option as the default DEBUG_LL choice which
requires the platform to do the right thing.
