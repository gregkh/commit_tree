usb: gadget: renesas_usbhs: remove desc from usbhs_pipe_malloc

Current usbhs_pipe_malloc() used usb_endpoint_descriptor to
get necessary information.
It was very good for mod_gadget which allocate pipe in runtime,
but is not good for mod_host which allocate pipe in initial timing.
This patch remove usb_endpoint_descriptor from usbhs_pipe_malloc()
