ixgbe: Cleanup q_vector interrupt throttle rate logic

This patch is meant to help cleanup the interrupt throttle rate logic by
storing the interrupt throttle rate as a value in microseconds instead of
interrupts per second.  The advantage to this approach is that the value
can now be stored in an 16 bit field and doesn't require as much math to
flip the value back and forth since the hardware already used microseconds
when setting the rate.
