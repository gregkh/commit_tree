Btrfs: don't panic if orphan item already exists

I've been hitting this BUG_ON() in btrfs_orphan_add when running xfstest 269 in
a loop.  This is because we will add an orphan item, do the truncate, the
truncate will fail for whatever reason (*cough*ENOSPC*cough*) and then we're
left with an orphan item still in the fs.  Then we come back later to do another
truncate and it blows up because we already have an orphan item.  This is ok so
just fix the BUG_ON() to only BUG() if ret is not EEXIST.  Thanks,
