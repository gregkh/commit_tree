rps: Add flag to skb to indicate rxhash is based on L4 tuple

The l4_rxhash flag was added to the skb structure to indicate
that the rxhash value was computed over the 4 tuple for the
packet which includes the port information in the encapsulated
transport packet.  This is used by the stack to preserve the
rxhash value in __skb_rx_tunnel.
