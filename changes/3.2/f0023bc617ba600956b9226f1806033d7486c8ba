vfs: add d_prune dentry operation

This adds a d_prune dentry operation that is called by the VFS prior to
pruning (i.e. unhashing and killing) a hashed dentry from the dcache.
Wrap dentry_lru_del() and use the new _prune() helper in the cases where we
are about to unhash and kill the dentry.

This will be used by Ceph to maintain a flag indicating whether the
complete contents of a directory are contained in the dcache, allowing it
to satisfy lookups and readdir without addition server communication.

Renumber a few DCACHE_* #defines to group DCACHE_OP_PRUNE with the other
DCACHE_OP_ bits.
