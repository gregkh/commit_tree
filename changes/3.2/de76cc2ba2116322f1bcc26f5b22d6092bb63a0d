musb_gadget: Fix for spurious interrupts on endpoint zero.

There is a multi-year old bug in the MUSB hardware which is not documented.
It causes spurious interrupts and have various symptoms, like endless
"SetupEnd came in a wrong ep0stage" messages. The fix is taken from the
FreeBSD's musb driver.

How to reproduce:
For example issue clear-stall on a couple of endpoints very fast,
like one request per 125us. After a while the bug triggers and the
musb-chip becomes unusable until next re-enumeration.
