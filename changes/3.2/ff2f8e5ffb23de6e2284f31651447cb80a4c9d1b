ARM: OMAP3: PM: fix pwrdm_post_transition call sequence

The context lost count is modified in omap_sram_idle() path when
pwrdm_post_transition() is called. But pwrdm_post_transition() is called
only after omap_gpio_resume_after_idle() is called. Correct this so that
context lost count is modified before calling omap_gpio_resume_after_idle().

This would be useful when OMAP GPIO save/restore context is called by
the OMAP GPIO driver itself.
