oprofile: Fix uninitialized memory access when writing to writing to oprofilefs

If oprofilefs_ulong_from_user() is called with count equals
zero, *val remains unchanged. Depending on the implementation it
might be uninitialized.

Change oprofilefs_ulong_from_user()'s interface to return count
on success. Thus, we are able to return early if count equals
zero which avoids using *val uninitialized. Fixing all users of
oprofilefs_ulong_ from_user().

This follows write syscall implementation when count is zero:
"If count is zero ... [and if] no errors are detected, 0 will be
returned without causing any other effect." (man 2 write)
