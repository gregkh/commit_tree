drm/i915: Initialize PCH refclks at modeset init time

The reference clock configuration must be done before any mode setting
can occur as all outputs must be disabled to change
anything. Initialize the clocks after turning everything off during
the initialization process.

Also, re-initialize the refclk at resume time.
