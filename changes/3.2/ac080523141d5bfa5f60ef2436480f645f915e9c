Platform: Brightness quirk for samsung laptop driver

On some Samsung laptops the brightness regulation works slightly different.
All SABI commands except for set_brightness work as expected. The behaviour
of set_brightness is as follows:

- Setting a new brightness will only step one level toward the new brightness
  level. For example, setting a level of 5 when the current level is 2 will
  result in a brightness level of 3.
- A spurious KEY_BRIGHTNESS_UP or KEY_BRIGHTNESS_DOWN event is also generated
  along with the change in brightness.
- Neither of the above two issues occur when changing from/to brightness
  level 0.

This patch adds detection and a non-intrusive workaround for the above issues.
