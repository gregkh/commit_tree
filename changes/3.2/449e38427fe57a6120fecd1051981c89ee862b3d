regmap: Provide access information via debugfs

Let userspace know what the access map for the device is. This is helpful
for verifying that the access map is correctly configured and could also
be useful for programs that try to work with the data. File format is:

register: R W V P

where R, W, V and P are 'y' or 'n' showing readable, writable, volatile
and precious respectively.
