ARM: 7171/1: unwind: add unwind directives to bitops assembly macros

The bitops functions (e.g. _test_and_set_bit) on ARM do not have unwind
annotations and therefore the kernel cannot backtrace out of them on a
fatal error (for example, NULL pointer dereference).

This patch annotates the bitops assembly macros with UNWIND annotations
so that we can produce a meaningful backtrace on error. Callers of the
macros are modified to pass their function name as a macro parameter,
enforcing that the macros are used as standalone function implementations.
