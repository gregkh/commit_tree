kmod: prevent kmod_loop_msg overflow in __request_module()

Due to post-increment in condition of kmod_loop_msg in __request_module(),
the system log can be spammed by much more than 5 instances of the 'runaway
loop' message if the number of events triggering it makes the kmod_loop_msg
to overflow.

Fix that by making sure we never increment it past the threshold.
