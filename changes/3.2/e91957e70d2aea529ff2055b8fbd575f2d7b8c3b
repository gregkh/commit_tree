msm: Implement init_card operation for MSM SDCC

This allows boards with non-standard sdio cards to fill the CIS/CCCR data.
It is particularly important for old msm72k boards using wl1251.
Also drop the obsolete embedded_sdio_data structure from the header
as it was intended to surve a similiar purpose but was not implemented.
