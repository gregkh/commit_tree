ARM: OMAP3: HWMOD: Fix DSS reset

DSS needs all DSS clocks to be enabled to be able to finish reset
properly. Before v3.1-rc1 the omapdss driver was managing clocks and
resets correctly. However, when omapdss started using runtime PM at
v3.1-rc1, the responsibility for the reset moved to HWMOD framework.

HWMOD framework does not currently enable all the DSS clocks when
resetting the DSS hardware. This hasn't caused any problems so far, but
we may just have been lucky.

dss_core's opt-clocks is also missing dss_96m_fck, which is a DSS clock
present only on OMAP3430, and thus required on OMAP3430 to finish the
reset.

This patch sets HWMOD_CONTROL_OPT_CLKS_IN_RESET and adds the dss_96m_fck
opt-clock for dss_core in OMAP3 HWMOD data, fixing the issue.
