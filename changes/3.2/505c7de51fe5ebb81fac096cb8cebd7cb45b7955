fbdev: sh_mobile_lcdc: Compute clock pattern using divider denominator

The clock divider pattern is computed based on the dot clock register
value which stores the divider denumerator. However, when using a 1:1
divider ratio, the register is programmed with a value that must not be
interpreted as a denominator. This results in a shift left operation
with a value of 32, which produces undefined behaviour.

Compute the clock pattern using the divider denominator, not the dot
clock register value.
