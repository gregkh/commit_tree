blackfin: Fixup export.h includes

Commit 8dc7a9c84 ("blackfin: Add export.h to files using
EXPORT_SYMBOL/THIS_MODULE") inserted some of the include statements into
sections protected by an unrelated #if CONFIG_... statement. This can cause,
depending on the configuration used, warnings like this one:

	arch/blackfin/mach-bf537/boards/stamp.c:2940: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
	arch/blackfin/mach-bf537/boards/stamp.c:2940: warning: type defaults to ‘int’ in declaration of ‘EXPORT_SYMBOL’
	arch/blackfin/mach-bf537/boards/stamp.c:2940: warning: parameter names (without types) in function declaration

This patch fixes it by moving the includes out of the #if protected sections.
