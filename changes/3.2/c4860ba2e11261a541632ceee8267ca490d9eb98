jme: PHY configuration for compatible issue

To perform PHY calibration and set a different EA value by chip ID,
Whenever the NIC chip power on, ie booting or resuming, we need to
force HW to calibrate PHY parameter again, and also set a proper EA
value which gather from experiment.

Those procedures help to reduce compatible issues(NIC is unable to link
up in some special case) in giga speed.
