[media] s5p-fimc: Add support for JPEG capture

Add support for transparent DMA transfer of JPEG data with MIPI-CSI2
USER1 format. In JPEG mode the color effect, scaling and cropping
is not supported as well as image rotation and flipping thus these
controls are marked as inactive if V4L2_PIX_FMT_JPEG pixel format
was selected.
