vmwgfx: Fix up query processing

Previously, query results could be placed in any buffer object, but since
we didn't allow pinned buffer objects, query results could be written when
that buffer was evicted, corrupting data in other buffers.

Now, require that buffers holding query results are no more than two pages
large, and allow one single pinned such buffer. When the command submission
code encounters query result structures in other buffers, the queries in the
pinned buffer will be finished using a query barrier for the last hardware
context using the buffer. Also if the command submission code detects
that a new hardware context is used for queries, all queries of the previous
hardware context is also flushed. Currently we use waiting for a no-op
occlusion query as a query barrier for a specific context.

The query buffer is also flushed and unpinned on context destructions,
master drops and before scanout bo placement.
