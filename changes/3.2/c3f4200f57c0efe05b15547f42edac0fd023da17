crypto: picoxcell - convert to platform ID table

Use a platform ID table and a single platform_driver.  It's neater and
makes the device tree addition easier and more consistent.  Rename the
match values to be inline with what they'll be in the device tree
bindings.  There aren't any current in-tree users of the existing device
names.
