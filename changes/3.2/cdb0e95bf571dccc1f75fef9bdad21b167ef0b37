drm/i915: Try harder during dp pattern 1 link training

Instead of going through the sequence just once, run through the whole
set up to 5 times to see if something can work. This isn't part of the
DP spec, but the BIOS seems to do it, and given that link training
failure is so bad, it seems reasonable to follow suit.
