block: make get_request[_wait]() fail if queue is dead

Currently get_request[_wait]() allocates request whether queue is dead
or not.  This patch makes get_request[_wait]() return NULL if @q is
dead.  blk_queue_bio() is updated to fail the submitted bio if request
allocation fails.  While at it, add docbook comments for
get_request[_wait]().

Note that the current code has rather unclear (there are spurious DEAD
tests scattered around) assumption that the owner of a queue
guarantees that no request travels block layer if the queue is dead
and this patch in itself doesn't change much; however, this will allow
fixing the broken assumption in the next patch.
