drm/radeon/kms: consolidate GART code, fix segfault after GPU lockup V2

After GPU lockup VRAM gart table is unpinned and thus its pointer
becomes unvalid. This patch move the unpin code to a common helper
function and set pointer to NULL so that page update code can check
if it should update GPU page table or not. That way bo still bound
to GART can be unbound (pci_unmap_page for all there page) properly
while there is no need to update the GPU page table.

V2 move the test for null gart out of the loop, small optimization
