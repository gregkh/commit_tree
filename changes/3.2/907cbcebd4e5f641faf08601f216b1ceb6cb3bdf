Btrfs: optimize how we account for space in truncate

Currently we're starting and stopping a transaction for no real reason, so kill
that and just reserve enough space as if we can truncate all in one transaction.
Also use btrfs_block_rsv_check() for our reserve to minimize the amount of space
we may have to allocate for our slack space.  Thanks,
