USB: ci13xxx_udc: fix logic to mark request dma addresses as invalid

The current driver sets the request's dma addr (mReq->req.dma) to 0 to
mark the DMA address as not valid. However some gadget drivers
(e.g. gadgetfs) set the request's dma addr to DMA_ADDR_INVALID to mark
the address as invalid. This leads to bogus data send because the
ci13xxx_udc driver assumes the request has already been mapped.

This patch fixes the problem, by using DMA_ADDR_INVALID instead of 0
to mark the request's DMA address as invalid.
