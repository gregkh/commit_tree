dccp: support for the exchange of NN options in established state 1/2

In contrast to static feature negotiation at the begin of a connection, this
patch introduces support for exchange of dynamically changing options.

Such an update/exchange is necessary in at least two cases:
 * CCID-2's Ack Ratio (RFC 4341, 6.1.2) which changes during the connection;
 * Sequence Window values that, as per RFC 4340, 7.5.2, should be sent "as
   the connection progresses".

Both are non-negotiable (NN) features, which means that no new capabilities
are negotiated, but rather that changes in known parameters are brought
up-to-date at either end.

Thse characteristics are reflected by the implementation:
 * only NN options can be exchanged after connection setup;
 * an ack is scheduled directly after activation to speed up the update;
 * CCIDs may request changes to an NN feature even if a negotiation for that
   feature is already underway: this is required by CCID-2, where changes in
   cwnd necessitate Ack Ratio changes, such that the previous Ack Ratio (which
   is still being negotiated) would cause irrecoverable RTO timeouts (thanks
   to work by Samuel Jero).
