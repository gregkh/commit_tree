ceph: use i_ceph_lock instead of i_lock

We have been using i_lock to protect all kinds of data structures in the
ceph_inode_info struct, including lists of inodes that we need to iterate
over while avoiding races with inode destruction.  That requires grabbing
a reference to the inode with the list lock protected, but igrab() now
takes i_lock to check the inode flags.

Changing the list lock ordering would be a painful process.

However, using a ceph-specific i_ceph_lock in the ceph inode instead of
i_lock is a simple mechanical change and avoids the ordering constraints
imposed by igrab().
