sched: Introduce primitives to account for CFS bandwidth tracking

In this patch we introduce the notion of CFS bandwidth, partitioned into
globally unassigned bandwidth, and locally claimed bandwidth.

 - The global bandwidth is per task_group, it represents a pool of unclaimed
   bandwidth that cfs_rqs can allocate from.
 - The local bandwidth is tracked per-cfs_rq, this represents allotments from
   the global pool bandwidth assigned to a specific cpu.

Bandwidth is managed via cgroupfs, adding two new interfaces to the cpu subsystem:
 - cpu.cfs_period_us : the bandwidth period in usecs
 - cpu.cfs_quota_us : the cpu bandwidth (in usecs) that this tg will be allowed
   to consume over period above.
