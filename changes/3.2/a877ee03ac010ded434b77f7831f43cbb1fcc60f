vfs: add "device" tag to /proc/self/mountstats

nfsiostat was failing to find mounted filesystems on kernels after
2.6.38 because of changes to show_vfsstat() by commit
c7f404b40a3665d9f4e9a927cc5c1ee0479ed8f9.  This patch adds back the
"device" tag before the nfs server entry so scripts can parse the
mountstats file correctly.
