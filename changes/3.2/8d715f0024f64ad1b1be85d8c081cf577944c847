drm/i915: add multi-threaded forcewake support

On IVB C0+ with newer BIOSes, the forcewake handshake has changed.  There's
now a bitfield for different driver components to keep the GT powered
on.  On Linux, we centralize forcewake handling in one place, so we
still just need a single bit, but we need to use the new registers if MT
forcewake is enabled.

This needs testing on affected machines.  Please reply with your
tested-by if you had problems after a BIOS upgrade and this patch fixes
them.

v2: force MT mode. shift by 16
v3: set MT force wake bits then check ECOBUS
