ext4: Rename ext4_free_blks_{count,set}() to refer to clusters

The field bg_free_blocks_count_{lo,high} in the block group
descriptor has been repurposed to hold the number of free clusters for
bigalloc functions.  So rename the functions so it makes it easier to
read and audit the block allocation and block freeing code.

Note: at this point in bigalloc development we doesn't support
online resize, so this also makes it really obvious all of the places
we need to fix up to add support for online resize.
