apic, i386/bigsmp: Fix false warnings regarding logical APIC ID mismatches

These warnings (generally one per CPU) are a result of
initializing x86_cpu_to_logical_apicid while apic_default is
still in use, but the check in setup_local_APIC() being done
when apic_bigsmp was already used as an override in
default_setup_apic_routing():

 Overriding APIC driver with bigsmp
 Enabling APIC mode:  Physflat.  Using 5 I/O APICs

Fix this (for the time being, i.e. until
x86_32_early_logical_apicid() will get removed again, as Tejun
says ought to be possible) by overriding the previously stored
values at the point where the APIC driver gets overridden.

v2: Move this and the pre-existing override logic into
    arch/x86/kernel/apic/bigsmp_32.c.
