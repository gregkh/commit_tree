staging: et131x: Remove TODO entry 'alloc_etherdev initilising memory with zero'

Removing this as I'm pretty sure its not true, and alloc_etherdev isn't provided by this driver anyway. Alternatively, its a badly written comment and I don't understand it.

This drivers use of alloc_etherdev() is within keeping with other net devices, so I'm happy.
