cifs: eliminate is_multi_rsp parm to find_cifs_mid

Change find_cifs_mid to only return NULL if a mid could not be found.
If we got part of a multi-part T2 response, then coalesce it and still
return the mid. The caller can determine the T2 receive status from
the flags in the mid.

With this change, there is no need to pass a pointer to "length" as
well so just pass by value. If a mid is found, then we can just mark
it as malformed. If one isn't found, then the value of "length" won't
change anyway.
