ARM: perf: Remove unnecessary armpmu->enable()s

Currently, armpmu_enable iterates through the events for a given
counter set, calling armpmu->enable on each before calling
armpmu->start to start the PMU's counters.

As armpmu->enable is called when each event is added, each event is
already configured in hardware. Due to this, calling armpmu->enable
in armpmu_enable is unnecessary and confusing.

This patch removes the unnecessary calls to armpmu->enable.
