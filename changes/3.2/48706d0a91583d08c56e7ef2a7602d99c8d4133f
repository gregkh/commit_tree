fuse: fix fuse_retrieve

Fix two bugs in fuse_retrieve():

 - retrieving more than one page would yield repeated instances of the
   first page

 - if more than FUSE_MAX_PAGES_PER_REQ pages were requested than the
   request page array would overflow

fuse_retrieve() was added in 2.6.36 and these bugs had been there since the
beginning.
