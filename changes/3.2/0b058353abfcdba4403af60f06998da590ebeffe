TTY: use tty_wait_until_sent_from_close in other drivers

Let's use the newly added helper to avoid stalls in drivers which are
not yet ported to tty_port helpers.

Those which are broken (call tty_wait_until_sent with irqs disabled)
are left untouched. They are in a deeper trouble than we are trying to
solve here. This includes amiserial, 68328serial, 68360serial and
crisv10.
