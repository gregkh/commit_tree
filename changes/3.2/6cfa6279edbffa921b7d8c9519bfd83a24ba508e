ARM: 7079/1: spi: Fix builderror in spi-pl022.c

This patch fixes a build error, introduced by commit (67fc8b9f, "PM: add
runtime PM support to core Primecell driver") which unfortunately was a little
bit incomplete and did contain a typo (11 instead of 22).
I'm not sure how this patch could have been tested back then, if it
doesn't even compile ;)

The build failure was:
drivers/spi/spi-pl022.c:2292: error: 'adev' undeclared (first use in
this function)
drivers/spi/spi-pl022.c:2344: error: 'pl022_suspend' undeclared here
(not in a function)

The build failure appears e.g. for the u8500 and realview defconfig.
