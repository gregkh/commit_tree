dmaengine/amba-pl08x: Align lli_len to max(src.width, dst.width)

Currently lli_len is aligned to min of two widths, which looks to be incorrect.
Instead it should be aligned to max of both widths.

Lets say, total_size = 441 bytes

MIN: lets check if min() suits or not:

CASE 1: srcwidth = 1, dstwidth = 4
min(src, dst) = 1

i.e. We program transfer size in control reg to 441.
Now, till 440 bytes everything is fine, but on the last byte DMAC can't transfer
1 byte to dst, as its width is 4.

CASE 2: srcwidth = 4, dstwidth = 1
min(src, dst) = 1

i.e. we program transfer size in control reg to 110 (data transferred = 110 * srcwidth).
So, here too 1 byte is left, but on the source side.

MAX: Lets check if max() suits or not:

CASE 3: srcwidth = 1, dstwidth = 4
max(src, dst) = 4

Aligned size is 440

i.e. We program transfer size in control reg to 440.
Now, all 440 bytes will be transferred without any issues.

CASE 4: srcwidth = 4, dstwidth = 1
max(src, dst) = 4

Aligned size is 440

i.e. We program transfer size in control reg to 110 (data transferred = 110 * srcwidth).
Now, also all 440 bytes will be transferred without any issues.
