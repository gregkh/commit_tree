Smack: smackfs cipso seq read repair

Commit 272cd7a8c67dd40a31ecff76a503bbb84707f757 introduced
a change to the way rule lists are handled and reported in
the smackfs filesystem. One of the issues addressed had to
do with the termination of read requests on /smack/load.
This change introduced a error in /smack/cipso, which shares
some of the same list processing code.

This patch updates all the file access list handling in
smackfs to use the code introduced for /smack/load.
