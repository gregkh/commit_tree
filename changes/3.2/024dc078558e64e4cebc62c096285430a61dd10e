ASoC: Cache connected input and output recursions

The number of connected input and output endpoints for a given widgets
can't change during a DAPM run so there is no need to redo the recursion
through branches of the tree we've already visited. Doing this on one of
my test systems gives an improvement of:

         Power    Path   Neighbour
Before:  63       607    731
After:   63       141    181

which scales up well as more widgets are involved in paths.
