[SCSI] qla2xxx: Fix "active_mask" may be used uninitialized warning.

Since active_mask is first assigned in an "else" block, the compiler throws
a warning saying that the active_mask variable may be used uninitialized in
a print statement later.  Initialize active_mask to 0 in the declaration to
stop the warning.
