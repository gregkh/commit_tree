PM / Domains: Do not take parent locks to modify subdomain counters

After the subdomain counter in struct generic_pm_domain has been
changed into an atomic_t field, it is possible to modify
pm_genpd_poweron() and pm_genpd_poweroff() so that they don't take
the parents locks.  This requires pm_genpd_poweron() to increment
the parent's subdomain counter before calling itself recursively
for the parent and to decrement it if an error is to be returned.
