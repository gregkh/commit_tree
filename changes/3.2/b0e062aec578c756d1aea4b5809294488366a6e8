target: Prevent TRANSPORT_FREE_CMD_INTR processing in core_tmr_drain_cmd_list

This patch contains a bugfix for TMR LUN_RESET related to TRANSPORT_FREE_CMD_INTR
operation, where core_tmr_drain_cmd_list() will now skip processing for this
case to prevent an ABORT_TASK status from being returned for descriptors that
are already queued up to be released by processing thread context.
