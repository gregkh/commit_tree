target: stop task timers earlier

Currently we stop the timers for all tasks in a command fairly late during
I/O completion, which is fairly pointless and requires all kinds of safety
checks.

Instead delete pending timers early on in transport_complete_task, thus
ensuring no new timers firest after that.  We take t_state_lock a bit later
in that function thus making sure currenly running timers are out of the
criticial section.  To be completely sure the timer has finished we also
add another del_timer_sync call when freeing the task.

This also allows removing TF_TIMER_RUNNING as it would be equivalent
to TF_ACTIVE now.
