tcp: md5: remove one indirection level in tcp_md5sig_pool

tcp_md5sig_pool is currently an 'array' (a percpu object) of pointers to
struct tcp_md5sig_pool. Only the pointers are NUMA aware, but objects
themselves are all allocated on a single node.

Remove this extra indirection to get proper percpu memory (NUMA aware)
and make code simpler.
