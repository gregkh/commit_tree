[SCSI] ipr: Fix BUG on adapter dump timeout

If an adapter dump times out, the ipr driver will abort the
dump and proceed to reset and recover the adapter. When an
adapter dump completes, the work thread which is reading the
adapter dump will initiate an adapter reset to recover the
adapter. However, when the adapter dump gets aborted, the
work thread should not initiate an adapter reset, since an
adapter reset is already in progress. This fixes a case of
calling pci_block_user_cfg_access overlapped, which results
in a BUG.
