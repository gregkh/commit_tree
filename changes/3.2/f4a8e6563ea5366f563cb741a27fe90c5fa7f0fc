Btrfs: fix meta data raid-repair merge problem

Commit 4a54c8c16 introduced raid-repair, killing the individual
readpage_io_failed_hook entries from inode.c and disk-io.c. Commit
4bb31e92 introduced new readahead code, adding a readpage_io_failed_hook to
disk-io.c.

The raid-repair commit had logic to disable raid-repair, if
readpage_io_failed_hook is set. Thus, the readahead commit effectively
disabled raid-repair for meta data.

This commit changes the logic to always attempt raid-repair when needed and
call the readpage_io_failed_hook in case raid-repair fails. This is much
more straight forward and should have been like that from the beginning.
