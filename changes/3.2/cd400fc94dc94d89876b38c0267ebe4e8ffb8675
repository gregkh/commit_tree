staging:iio:adc:ad7150: remove conversion mode handling.

The AD7150 family of devices power up in continues conversion mode.
We can stay in this mode, unless power consumption becomes a real issue.
Actually the event generation as well as the running average
relies on continues conversion mode, so we better stay there.
