block: add GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN

There are cases where suppressing partition scan is useful - e.g. for
lo devices and pseudo SATA devices which advertise to be a disk but
get upset on partition scan (some port multiplier control devices show
such behavior).

This patch adds GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN which suppresses partition scan
regardless of the number of possible partitions.  disk_partitionable()
is renamed to disk_part_scan_enabled() as suppressing partition scan
doesn't imply the device can't be partitioned using
BLKPG_ADD/DEL_PARTITION calls from userland.  show_partition() now
directly tests disk_max_parts() to maintain backward-compatibility.

-v2: Updated to make it clear that only partition scan is suppressed
     not partitioning itself as suggested by Kay Sievers.
