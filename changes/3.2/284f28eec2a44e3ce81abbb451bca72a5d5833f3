[media] sh: ap3rxa: remove redundant soc-camera platform data fields

The sh_mobile_ceu_camera driver has been converted to use the V4L2
subdevice .[gs]_mbus_config() operations, therefore we don't need
SOCAM_* flags for the soc_camera_platform driver anymore. The ov772x
driver only supports 8 bits per sample pixel codes, hence the
OV772X_FLAG_8BIT flag has no effect. Remove both of them.
