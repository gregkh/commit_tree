xfs: clean up xfs_ioerror_alert

Instead of passing the block number and mount structure explicitly
get them off the bp and fix make the argument order more natural.

Also move it to xfs_buf.c and stop printing the device name given
that we already get the fs name as part of xfs_alert, and we know
what device is operates on because of the caller that gets printed,
finally rename it to xfs_buf_ioerror_alert and pass __func__ as
argument where it makes sense.
