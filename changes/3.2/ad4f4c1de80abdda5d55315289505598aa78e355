[SCSI] isci: initial sgpio write support

Basic support to initialize the gpio unit, accept an incomming
SAS_GPIO_REG_TX_GP bitstream, and translate it to the ODx.n fields in
the hardware registers.  If register indexes outside the supported range
are specified in the SMP frame we simply accept the write and return how
many registers (SFF-8485) were written (libsas reports this as residue
in the request).
