Staging: hv: vmbus: Properly deal with de-registering channel callback

Ensure that we correctly handle racing invocations of the channel callback
when the channel is being closed. We do this using the channel's inbound_lock.
A side-effect of this strategy is that we avoid repeatedly picking up this lock
as we drain the inbound ring-buffer.
