leds: turn the blink_timer off before starting to blink

Depending on the implementation of the hardware blinking function in
blink_set(), the led can support hardware blinking for some values of
delay_on and delay_off and fall-back to software blinking for some other
values.

Turning off the blink_timer unconditionally before starting to blink
make sure that a sequence like:

  OFF
  hardware blinking
  software blinking
  hardware blinking

does not leave the software blinking timer active.
