intel-iommu: Workaround IOTLB hang on Ironlake GPU

To work around a hardware issue, we have to submit IOTLB flushes while
the graphics engine is idle. The graphics driver will (we hope) go to
great lengths to ensure that it gets that right on the affected
chipset(s)... so let's not screw it over by deferring the unmap and
doing it later. That wouldn't be very helpful.
