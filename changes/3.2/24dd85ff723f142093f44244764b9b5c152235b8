io-mapping: ensure io_mapping_map_atomic _is_ atomic

For the !HAVE_ATOMIC_IOMAP case the stub functions did not call
pagefault_disable/_enable. The i915 driver relies on the map
actually being atomic, otherwise it can deadlock with it's own
pagefault handler in the gtt pwrite fastpath.

This is exercised by gem_mmap_gtt from the intel-gpu-toosl gem
testsuite.

v2: Chris Wilson noted the lack of an include.
