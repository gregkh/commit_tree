staging: brcm80211: remove target platform limitations for drivers

Several issue have been reported building the driver on big endian
systems. Following commits were done on driver Kconfig:

d462039 Staging: brcm80211: disable drivers except for X86 or MIPS platforms
15e5201 Staging: brcm80211: disable drivers for PPC platforms

These problems have been resolved so the added 'depends' lines in
the Kconfig have been removed.

Compile tested it for following architectures:
little endian
	x86
	x86_64
	arm
	mips
big endian
	ppc64
	sparc64
	mips
