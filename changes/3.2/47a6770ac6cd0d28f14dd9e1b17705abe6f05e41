msm: boards: Fix fallout from removal of machine_desc in fixup

After 0744a3ee (ARM: platform fixups: remove mdesc argument to
fixup function, 2010-12-20) the fixup functions introduced in
9e775ad (ARM: 7012/1: Set proper TEXT_OFFSET for newer MSMs,
2011-08-12) cause warnings like:

arch/arm/mach-msm/board-msm8x60.c:85: warning: initialization
from incompatible pointer type

Fix them by removing the machine_desc argument from the fixup
functions.
