perf, core: Introduce attrs to count in either host or guest mode

The two new attributes exclude_guest and exclude_host can
bes used by user-space to tell the kernel to setup
performance counter to either only count while the CPU is in
guest or in host mode.

An additional check is also introduced to make sure
user-space does not try to exclude guest and host mode from
counting.
