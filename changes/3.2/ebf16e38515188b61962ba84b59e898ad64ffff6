Staging: hv: file2alias: fix up alias creation logic for hv_vmbus_device_id

When I added the driver_data field to hv_vmbus_device_id, I forgot to
take into the account how the alias was created, so it would append the
kernel pointer to the end of the alias, which is not correct.

This changes how the hv_vmbus_device_id alias is created to proper
account for the driver_data field.  As no module yet uses this alias, it
is safe to fix this up at this point in the commit stream.
