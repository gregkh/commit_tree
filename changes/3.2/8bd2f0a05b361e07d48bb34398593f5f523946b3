md: ensure new badblocks are handled promptly.

When we mark blocks as bad we need them to be acknowledged by the
metadata handler promptly.

For an in-kernel metadata handler that was already being done.  But
for an external metadata handler we need to alert it of the change by
sending a notification through the sysfs file.  This adds that
notification.
