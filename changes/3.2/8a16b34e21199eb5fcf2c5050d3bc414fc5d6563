ARM: perf: add support for multiple PMUs

Currently, a single static instance of struct pmu is used when
registering an ARM PMU with the main perf subsystem. This limits
the ARM perf code to supporting a single PMU.

This patch replaces the static struct pmu instance with a member
variable on struct arm_pmu. This provides bidirectional mapping
between the two structs, and therefore allows for support of multiple
PMUs. The function 'to_arm_pmu' is provided for convenience.

PMU-generic functions are also updated to use the new mapping, and
PMU-generic initialisation of the member variables is moved into a new
function: armpmu_init.
