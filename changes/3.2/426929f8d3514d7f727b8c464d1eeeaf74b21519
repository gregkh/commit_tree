TTY: serial, use ASYNCB_CLOSING in uart_close

We need to move port->mutex locking after wait_until_sent in
uart_close (for rationale see next patches). But if we did it now, we
would introduce a race between close and open. This is exactly why
port->mutex is locked at the top of uart_close.

To avoid the race, we add ASYNCB_CLOSING to uart_close. Like every
other sane TTY driver. Thanks to tty_port_block_til_ready used in
uart_open we will have this for free. Then we can move the port->mutex
lock.

Also note that this will make the conversion to tty_port helpers
easier. They are currently handling ASYNC_CLOSING flag correctly.
