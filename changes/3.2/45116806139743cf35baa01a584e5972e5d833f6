powerpc/85xx: Setup secondary cores PIR with hard SMP id

Normally logical and hard cpu ID are the same, however in same cases like
on the P3060 they may differ.  Where the logical is 0..5, the hard id
goes 0,1,4..7.  This can causes issues for places we utilize PIR to index
into array like in debug exception handlers for finding the exception
stack.

Move to setting up PIR with hard_smp_processor_id fixes the issue.
