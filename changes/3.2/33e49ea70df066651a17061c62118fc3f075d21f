perf tools: Make stat/record print fatal signals of the target program

When a program crashes under perf there is no message about it, unlike
when running it from bash. This can be confusing and lead to wrong
actions during debugging.

Print fatal signals in perf stat/record.

Thanks to Furat Afram for finding the problem originally
