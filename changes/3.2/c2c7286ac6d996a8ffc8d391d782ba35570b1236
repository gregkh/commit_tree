intr_remap: Call dmar_dev_scope_init() explicitly

Both DMA-remapping aswell as Interrupt-remapping depend on the
dmar dev scope to be initialized. When both DMA and
IRQ-remapping are enabled, we depend on DMA-remapping init code
to call dmar_dev_scope_init(). This resulted in not doing this
init when DMA-remapping was turned off but interrupt-remapping
turned on in the kernel config.

This caused interrupt routing to break with CONFIG_INTR_REMAP=y
and CONFIG_DMAR=n.

This issue was introduced by this commit:

 |    x86: intel-iommu: Convert detect_intel_iommu to use iommu_init hook

Fix this by calling dmar_dev_scope_init() explicitly from the
interrupt remapping code too.
