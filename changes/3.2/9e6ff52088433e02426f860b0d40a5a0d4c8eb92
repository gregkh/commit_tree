ALSA: hdspm - Fix MADI channel format in the status ioctl

SNDRV_HDSPM_IOCTL_GET_STATUS is supposed to query the current card
status, so we have to return what we receive on the MADI wire (RX), not
what we transmit (TX) to others. The latter is a config item to be
queried via SNDRV_HDSPM_IOCTL_GET_CONFIG.
