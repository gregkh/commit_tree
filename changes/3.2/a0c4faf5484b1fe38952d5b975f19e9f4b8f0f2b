sfc: Correct reporting and validation of TX interrupt coalescing

The reported TX IRQ moderation is generated in a completely crazy way.
Make it simple and correct.

When channels are shared between RX and TX, TX IRQ moderation must be
the same as RX IRQ moderation, but must be specified as 0!  Allow it
to be either specified as the same, or left at its previous value
in which case it will be quietly overridden.
