ARM: 7072/1: debug: use kconfig choice for selecting DEBUG_LL UART

Enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_LL (which is required for earlyprintk) hardwires
the debug UART address into the kernel, so that we can print before the
platform is initialised.

If the user inadvertently selects multiple platforms with DEBUG_LL
enabled, the UART address may not be correct and will likely cause the
kernel to hang in the very early stages of boot.

This patch, based on a skeleton from Russell, uses a Kconfig choice for
selecting the DEBUG_LL UART, therefore allowing the user to make a
choice about the supported platform when DEBUG_LL is enabled.
