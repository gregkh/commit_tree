ARM: mm: Add strongly ordered descriptor support.

On certain architectures, there might be a need to mark certain
addresses with strongly ordered memory attributes to avoid ordering
issues at the interconnect level.

On OMAP4, the asynchronous bridge buffers can only be drained
with strongly ordered accesses and hence the need to mark the
memory strongly ordered.
