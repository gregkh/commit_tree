xen-swiotlb: Retry up three times to allocate Xen-SWIOTLB

We can fail seting up Xen-SWIOTLB if:
 - The host does not have enough contiguous DMA32 memory available
   (can happen on a machine that has fragmented memory from starting,
   stopping many guests).
 - Not enough low memory (almost never happens).

We retry allocating and exchanging the swath of contiguous memory
up to three times. Each time we decrease the amount we need  - the
minimum being of 2MB.

If we compleltly fail, we will print the reason for failure on the Xen
console on top of doing it to earlyprintk=xen console.
