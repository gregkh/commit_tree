target: remove the task_sg_bidi field se_task and pSCSI BIDI support

This field is never used given that BIDI handling happens at the
command and not the task level.  Remove it and the dead code in
pscsi that tries to work on it.

It also prevents pSCSI passthrough for the two currently enabled BIDI
commands now that task->task_sg_bidi support has been removed.
