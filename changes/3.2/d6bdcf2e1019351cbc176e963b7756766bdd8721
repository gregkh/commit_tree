staging: nvec: Add battery quirk to ignore incomplete responses

The nvec_power system polls nvec for battery information. In some
cases, that part seems to be overloaded and unable to respond
fast in which case it sends an incomplete response. We need to
mark the transfer as completed, though, in order to prevent
endless retries which can kill nvec.
