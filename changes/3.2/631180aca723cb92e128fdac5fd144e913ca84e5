TTY: call tty_driver_lookup_tty unconditionally

Commit 4a2b5fddd5 (Move tty lookup/reopen to caller) made the call to
tty_driver_lookup_tty conditional in tty_open. It doesn't look like it
was an intention. Or if it was, it was not documented in the changelog
and the code now looks weird. For example there would be no need to
remember the tty driver and tty index. Further the condition depends
on a tty which we drop a reference of already.

If I'm looking correctly, this should not matter thanks to the locking
currently done there. Thus, tty_driver->ttys[idx] cannot change under
our hands. But anyway, it makes sense to change that to the old
behaviour.
