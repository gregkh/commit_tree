binfmt_elf: fix PIE execution with randomization disabled

The case of address space randomization being disabled in runtime through
randomize_va_space sysctl is not treated properly in load_elf_binary(),
resulting in SIGKILL coming at exec() time for certain PIE-linked binaries
in case the randomization has been disabled at runtime prior to calling
exec().

Handle the randomize_va_space == 0 case the same way as if we were not
supporting .text randomization at all.

Based on original patch by H.J. Lu and Josh Boyer.
