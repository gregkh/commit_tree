KVM: x86 emulator: Make x86_decode_insn() return proper macros

Return EMULATION_OK/FAILED consistently.  Also treat instruction fetch
errors, not restricted to X86EMUL_UNHANDLEABLE, as EMULATION_FAILED;
although this cannot happen in practice, the current logic will continue
the emulation even if the decoder fails to fetch the instruction.
