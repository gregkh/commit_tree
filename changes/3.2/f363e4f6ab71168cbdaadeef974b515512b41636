HID: wiimote: Add IR input device

The IR cam of the wiimote reports 4 trackable lights as absolute values. Since
we can turn the IR cam on and off, we register a separate input device so we can
react on open/close callbacks to save wiimote battery power when IR cam is not
needed.

The cam can be in four states: off, basic, extended and full
The DRM chooser automatically selects a proper DRM that includes all required IR
data so no information is lost.
