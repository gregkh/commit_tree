TOMOYO: Fix pathname handling of disconnected paths.

Current tomoyo_realpath_from_path() implementation returns strange pathname
when calculating pathname of a file which belongs to lazy unmounted tree.
Use local pathname rather than strange absolute pathname in that case.

Also, this patch fixes a regression by commit 02125a82 "fix apparmor
dereferencing potentially freed dentry, sanitize __d_path() API".
