pinctrl: fix "warning: 'struct pinctrl_dev' declared inside parameter list"

when pinctl subsystem is not selected, when compiling drivers including
the include/linux/pinctrl/pinctrl.h, we will get the warning as below:
In file included from include/linux/pinctrl/pinmux.h:17,
                 from drivers/tty/serial/sirfsoc_uart.c:25:
include/linux/pinctrl/pinctrl.h:126: warning: 'struct pinctrl_dev'
		declared inside parameter list
include/linux/pinctrl/pinctrl.h:126: warning: its scope is only this
      definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want
