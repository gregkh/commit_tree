fb: sh-mobile: Fix deadlock risk between lock_fb_info() and console_lock()

Following on Herton's patch "fb: avoid possible deadlock caused by
fb_set_suspend" which moves lock_fb_info() out of fb_set_suspend()
to its callers, correct sh-mobile's locking around call to
fb_set_suspend() and the same sort of deaklocks with console_lock()
due to order of taking the lock.

console_lock() must be taken while fb_info is already locked and fb_info
must be locked while calling fb_set_suspend().
