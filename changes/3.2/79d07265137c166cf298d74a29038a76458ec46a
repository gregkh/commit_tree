ASoC: wm8990: Use snd_soc_update_bits for read-modify-write

Use snd_soc_update_bits for read-modify-write register access instead of
open-coding it using snd_soc_read and snd_soc_write

This patch also includes a comment fix in wm8990_set_dai_pll(),
if freq_in and freq_out are 0, what we do is to clear WM8990_PLL_ENA bit.
Thus the comment should be "Turn off PLL".
