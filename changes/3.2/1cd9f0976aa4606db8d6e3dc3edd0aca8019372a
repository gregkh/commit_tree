ext2,ext3,ext4: don't inherit APPEND_FL or IMMUTABLE_FL for new inodes

This doesn't make much sense, and it exposes a bug in the kernel where
attempts to create a new file in an append-only directory using
O_CREAT will fail (but still leave a zero-length file).  This was
discovered when xfstests #79 was generalized so it could run on all
file systems.
