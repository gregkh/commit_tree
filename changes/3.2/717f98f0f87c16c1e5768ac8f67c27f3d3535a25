rcu: Eliminate in_irq() checks in rcu_enter_nohz()

The in_irq() check in rcu_enter_nohz() is redundant because if we really
are in an interrupt, the attempt to re-enter dyntick-idle mode will invoke
rcu_needs_cpu() in any case, which will force the check for RCU callbacks.
So this commit removes the check along with the set_need_resched().
