sched: Validate CFS quota hierarchies

Add constraints validation for CFS bandwidth hierarchies.

Validate that:
   max(child bandwidth) <= parent_bandwidth

In a quota limited hierarchy, an unconstrained entity
(e.g. bandwidth==RUNTIME_INF) inherits the bandwidth of its parent.

This constraint is chosen over sum(child_bandwidth) as notion of over-commit is
valuable within SCHED_OTHER.  Some basic code from the RT case is re-factored
for reuse.
