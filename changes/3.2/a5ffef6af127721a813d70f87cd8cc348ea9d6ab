OMAP: clockdomain code/data: remove omap_chip bitmask from struct clockdomain

At Tony's request, remove the omap_chip bitmasks from the clockdomain
and clockdomain dependency definitions.  Instead, initialize
clockdomains based on one or more lists that are applicable to a
particular SoC family, variant, and silicon revision.

patch - thanks Tony.
