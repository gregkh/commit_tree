regmap: Add the indexed cache support

This is the simplest form of a cache available in regcache.  Any
registers whose default value is 0 are ignored.  If any of those
registers are modified in the future, they will be placed in the
cache on demand.  The cache layout is essentially using the provided
register defaults by the regcache core directly and does not re-map
it to another representation.
