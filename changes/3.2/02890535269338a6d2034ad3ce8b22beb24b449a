ASoC: ssm2602: Support setting the oscillator and the clock output state

Currently the oscillator is always enabled and the clock output is always
disabled. This patch adds support for controlling the oscillator and clock
output state through snd_soc_dai_set_sysclk. Which makes it possible to
disable or enable them dynamically according to the requirements of the board
on which the CODEC is used.

This patch also slightly modifies the behavior as to when the oscillator is
going to be disabled in low-power states. Previously it would only be disabled
in BIAS_OFF, now it is also going to be disabled in BIAS_STANDBY, since no
components which depend on it should be active in this state.
