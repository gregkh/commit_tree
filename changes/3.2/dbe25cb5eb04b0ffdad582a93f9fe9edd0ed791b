wl12xx: temporarily disable advanced ap functions

In order to keep to driver compiling during the patchset,
while avoiding one-huge-patch, temporarily disable some
advanced ap functions.

These changes will be reverted later in the patchset, as
part of the patches for advanced ap functions support.
