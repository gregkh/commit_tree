dmaengine/amba-pl08x: Choose peripheral bus as master bus

When we have DMA transfers between peripheral and memory, then we shouldn't
reduce width of peripheral at all, as that may be a strict requirement. But we
can always reduce width of memory access, with some compromise in performance.
Thus, we must select peripheral as master and not memory.

Also this rearranges code to make it shorter.
