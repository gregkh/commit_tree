kernel: fix up module header handling in rcutiny files

The file rcutiny.c does not need moduleparam.h header, as
there are no modparams in this file.

However rcutiny_plugin.h does define a module_init() and
a module_exit() and it uses the various MODULE_ macros, so
it really does need module.h included.
