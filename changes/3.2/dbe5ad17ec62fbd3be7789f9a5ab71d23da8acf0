evm: add Kconfig TCG_TPM dependency

Although the EVM encrypted-key should be encrypted/decrypted using a
trusted-key, a user-defined key could be used instead. When using a user-
defined key, a TCG_TPM dependency should not be required.  Unfortunately,
the encrypted-key code needs to be refactored a bit in order to remove
this dependency.

This patch adds the TCG_TPM dependency.
