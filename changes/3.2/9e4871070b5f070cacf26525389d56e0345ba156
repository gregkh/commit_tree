Btrfs: skip looking for delalloc if we don't have ->fill_delalloc

We always look for delalloc bytes in our io_tree so we can fill in delalloc.
This is fine in most cases, but if we're writing out the btree_inode this is
just a superfluous tree search on the io_tree, and if we have a lot of metadata
dirty this could be an expensive check.  So instead check to see if our io_tree
has a ->fill_delalloc op, and if not don't even bother doing the lookup.
Thanks,
