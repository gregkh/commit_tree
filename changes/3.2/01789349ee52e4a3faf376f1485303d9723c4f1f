net: introduce IFF_UNICAST_FLT private flag

Use IFF_UNICAST_FTL to find out if driver handles unicast address
filtering. In case it does not, promisc mode is entered.

Patch also fixes following drivers:
stmmac, niu: support uc filtering and yet it propagated
	ndo_set_multicast_list
bna, benet, pxa168_eth, ks8851, ks8851_mll, ksz884x : has set
	ndo_set_rx_mode but do not support uc filtering
