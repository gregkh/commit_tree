[media] msp3400: Add standards detection to the driver

As msp3400 allows standards detection, add support for it. That
efectivelly means that devices with msp3400 can now implement
VIDIOC_QUERYSTD, and it will provide very good detection for
the standard, specially if combined with a video decoder detection.
