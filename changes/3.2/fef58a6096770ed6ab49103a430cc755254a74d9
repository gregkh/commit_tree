target: Reject SCSI data overflow for fabrics using transport_generic_map_mem_to_cmd

This patch changes transport_generic_map_mem_to_cmd() to reject SCSI data
overflow and to send exception status with CHECK_CONDITION + TCM_INVALID_CDB_FIELD
for fabrics that are passing a pre-populated struct scatterlist (eg: tcm_loop
and iscsi-target) being mapped into se_cmd->t_data_sg and se_cmd->t_data_nents.

This addresses an OOPs where transport_allocate_data_tasks() would walk
the incorrect post OVERFLOW cmd->data_length value beyond the end of
the passed scatterlist.
