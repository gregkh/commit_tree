iwlagn: move the check_empty logic to the transport layer

This logic is responsible to tell mac80211 when the HW queues are
empty and the BA session can be started / torn down.

Fix a bug on the way:
When the the Tx BA session is stopped and the HW queues aren't empty,
we stop the SW queue to drain the HW queue and then switch to the
legacy HW queue. This is the IWL_EMPTYING_HW_QUEUE_DELBA state.

While in this state, we never wake the SW queue, even when the HW
queue is almost empty, since we need to drain it completely. Look
at iwl_trans_pcie_reclaim regarding this.

Once the HW queue is really empty, we must wake the SW queue in order
to get traffic to the legacy queue.
This step was missing leading to an odd situation were the traffic
would just stall after we tore down a Tx BA session while the HW
queue was not empty.
