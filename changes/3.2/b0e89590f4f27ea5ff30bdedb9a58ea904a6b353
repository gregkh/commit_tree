ARM: PMU: move CPU PMU platform device handling and init into perf

Once upon a time, OProfile and Perf fought hard over who could play with
the PMU. To stop all hell from breaking loose, pmu.c offered an internal
reserve/release API and took care of parsing PMU platform data passed in
from board support code.

Now that Perf has ingested OProfile, let's move the platform device
handling into the Perf driver and out of the PMU locking code.
Unfortunately, the lock has to remain to prevent Perf being bitten by
out-of-tree modules such as LTTng, which still claim a right to the PMU
when Perf isn't looking.
