powerpc/powernv: Add OPAL takeover from PowerVM

On machines supporting the OPAL firmware version 1, the system
is initially booted under pHyp. We then use a special hypercall
to verify if OPAL is available and if it is, we then trigger
a "takeover" which disables pHyp and loads the OPAL runtime
firmware, giving control to the kernel in hypervisor mode.

This patch add the necessary code to detect that the OPAL takeover
capability is present when running under PowerVM (aka pHyp) and
perform said takeover to get hypervisor control of the processor.

To perform the takeover, we must first use RTAS (within Open
Firmware runtime environment) to start all processors & threads,
in order to give control to OPAL on all of them. We then call
the takeover hypercall on everybody, OPAL will re-enter the kernel
main entry point passing it a flat device-tree.
