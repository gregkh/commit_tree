staging: zcache: fix crash on cpu remove

In the case that a cpu is taken offline before zcache_do_preload() is
ever called on the cpu, the per-cpu zcache_preloads structure will
be uninitialized.  In the CPU_DEAD case for zcache_cpu_notifier(),
kp->obj is not checked before calling kmem_cache_free() on it.
If it is NULL, a crash results.

This patch ensures that both kp->obj and kp->page are not NULL before
calling the respective free functions. In practice, just checking
one or the other should be sufficient since they are assigned together
in zcache_do_preload(), but I check both for safety.
