drm/i915: Dumb down the semaphore logic

While I think the previous code is correct, it was hard to follow and
hard to debug. Since we already have a ring abstraction, might as well
use it to handle the semaphore updates and compares.

I don't expect this code to make semaphores better or worse, but you
never know...

v2:
Remove magic per Keith's suggestions.
Ran Daniel's gem_ring_sync_loop test on this.

v3:
Ignored one of Keith's suggestions.

v4:
Removed some bloat per Daniel's recommendation.
