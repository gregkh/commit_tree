omap: iommu/iovmm: move to dedicated iommu folder

Move OMAP's iommu drivers to the dedicated iommu drivers folder.

While OMAP's iovmm (virtual memory manager) driver does not strictly
belong to the iommu drivers folder, move it there as well, because
it's by no means OMAP-specific (in concept. technically it is still
coupled with OMAP's iommu).

Eventually, iovmm will be completely replaced with the generic,
iommu-based, dma-mapping API.
