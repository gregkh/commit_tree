staging: vme: get rid of struct vme_device_id and slots

Previously, the device-driver matching mechanism depended on the
vme_device_id structure due to the need for a bind table per driver.
This method of matching is no longer used so this patch merges the
fields of struct vme_device_id into struct vme_dev. Since this also
renders the slot field meaningless, it has also been removed in this
patch.
