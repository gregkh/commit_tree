KVM: x86: report valid microcode update ID

Windows Server 2008 SP2 checked build with smp > 1 BSOD's during
boot due to lack of microcode update:

*** Assertion failed: The system BIOS on this machine does not properly
support the processor.  The system BIOS did not load any microcode update.
A BIOS containing the latest microcode update is needed for system reliability.
(CurrentUpdateRevision != 0)
***   Source File: d:\longhorn\base\hals\update\intelupd\update.c, line 440

Report a non-zero microcode update signature to make it happy.
