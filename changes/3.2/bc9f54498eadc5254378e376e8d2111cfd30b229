PM / shmobile: Avoid restoring the INTCS state during initialization

The SH7372 PM domain initialization routine calls pd_power_up()
that executes the domain's .resume() callback, if present, and for
the A4R domain this callback attepmts to restore the INTCS state from
uninitialized data.  To avoid that, introduce __pd_power_up() that
will only execute the domain's .resume() callback if its second
argument is 'true' and make the SH7372 PM domain initialization
use it with 'false' as its second argument.  Redefine pd_power_up()
as a wrapper around __pd_power_up().
