security: Fix security_old_inode_init_security() when CONFIG_SECURITY is not set

Commit 1e39f384bb01 ("evm: fix build problems") makes the stub version
of security_old_inode_init_security() return 0 when CONFIG_SECURITY is
not set.

But that makes callers such as reiserfs_security_init() assume that
security_old_inode_init_security() has set name, value, and len
arguments properly - but security_old_inode_init_security() left them
uninitialized which then results in interesting failures.

Revert security_old_inode_init_security() to the old behavior of
returning EOPNOTSUPP since both callers (reiserfs and ocfs2) handle this
just fine.

[ Also fixed the S_PRIVATE(inode) case of the actual non-stub
  security_old_inode_init_security() function to return EOPNOTSUPP
  for the same reason, as pointed out by Mimi Zohar.

  It got incorrectly changed to match the new function in commit
  fb88c2b6cbb1: "evm: fix security/security_old_init_security return
  code".   - Linus ]
