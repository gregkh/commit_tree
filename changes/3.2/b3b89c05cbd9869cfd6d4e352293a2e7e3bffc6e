OMAP: DSS2: DSI: Introduce generic read functions

Introduce read functions which use generic Processor-to-Peripheral
transaction types. These are needed by some devices which may not support
corresponding DCS commands.

Add function dsi_vc_generic_send_read_request() which can send
a short packet with 0, 1 or 2 bytes of request data and the corresponding
generic data type.

Rename function dsi_vc_dcs_read_rx_fifo() to dsi_vc_read_rx_fifo() and modify
it to take the enum "dss_dsi_content_type" as an argument to use either DCS
or GENERIC Peripheral-to-Processor transaction types while parsing data read
from the device.
