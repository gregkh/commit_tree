ALSA: usb-audio: increase control transfer timeout

There are certain devices that are reportedly so slow that they need
more than 100 ms to handle control transfers.  Therefore, increase the
timeout in mixer(_quirks).c to 1000 ms.

The timeout parameter of snd_usb_ctl_msg() is now constant, so we can
drop it.
