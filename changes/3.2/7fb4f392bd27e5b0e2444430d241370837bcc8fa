ALSA: intel8x0: improve virtual environment detection

Detection code improved by PCI SSID usage. VM optimization
now enabled only for known devcices (skip host devices forwarded
to VM by VT-d or same kind of technology).
For debug/troubleshooting purposes optimization can be
forced (on/off) by module parameter: "inside_vm" (boolean).

Known devices (PCI SSID):
1af4:1100: Reserved for KVM devices. Note this is not yet
           implemented for KVM's ICH/AC'97 emulation.
1ab8:xxxx: Parallels ICH/AC'97 emulated sound.
