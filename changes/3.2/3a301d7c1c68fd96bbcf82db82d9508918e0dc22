tracing: Clean up tb_fmt to not give faulty compile warning

gcc incorrectly states that the variable "fmt" is uninitialized when
CC_OPITMIZE_FOR_SIZE is set.

Instead of just blindly setting fmt to NULL, the code is cleaned up
a little to be a bit easier for humans to follow, as well as gcc
to know the variables are initialized.
