vmscan: fix initial shrinker size handling

A shrinker function can return -1, means that it cannot do anything
without a risk of deadlock.  For example prune_super() does this if it
cannot grab a superblock refrence, even if nr_to_scan=0.  Currently we
interpret this -1 as a ULONG_MAX size shrinker and evaluate `total_scan'
according to this.  So the next time around this shrinker can cause
really big pressure.  Let's skip such shrinkers instead.

Also make total_scan signed, otherwise the check (total_scan < 0) below
never works.
