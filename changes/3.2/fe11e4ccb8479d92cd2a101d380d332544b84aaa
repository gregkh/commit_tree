cifs: clean up check_rfc1002_header

Rename it for better clarity as to what it does and have the caller pass
in just the single type byte. Turn the if statement into a switch and
optimize it by placing the most common message type at the top. Move the
header length check back into cifs_demultiplex_thread in preparation
for adding a new receive phase and normalize the cFYI messages.
