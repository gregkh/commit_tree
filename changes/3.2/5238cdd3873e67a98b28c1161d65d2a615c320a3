sched: Prevent buddy interactions with throttled entities

Buddies allow us to select "on-rq" entities without actually selecting them
from a cfs_rq's rb_tree.  As a result we must ensure that throttled entities
are not falsely nominated as buddies.  The fact that entities are dequeued
within throttle_entity is not sufficient for clearing buddy status as the
nomination may occur after throttling.
