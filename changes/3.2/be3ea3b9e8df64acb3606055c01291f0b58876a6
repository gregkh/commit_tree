ASoC: Use new register map API for ASoC generic physical I/O

Remove all the ASoC specific physical I/O code and replace it with calls
into the regmap API. The bulk write code can only be used safely if all
regmap calls are locked with the CODEC lock, we need to add bulk support
to the regmap API or replace the code with an open coded loop (though
currently it has no users...).
