powerpc: Copy down exception vectors after feature fixups

kdump fails because we try to execute an HV only instruction. Feature
fixups are being applied after we copy the exception vectors down to 0
so they miss out on any updates.

We have always had this issue but it only became critical in v3.0
when we added CFAR support (breaks POWER5) and v3.1 when we added
POWERNV (breaks everyone).
