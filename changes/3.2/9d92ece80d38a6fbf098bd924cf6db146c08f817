staging: rtl8192e: Cleanup checkpatch -f errors - Part XIV

With this patch, all of the checkpatch errors are fixed; however, only
some of the lines that are too long were fixed. To complete the fixing
of these warnings, the file rtllib_softmac.c will need refactoring. In addition,
some of the variables may need renaming. Those changes can be deferred.
