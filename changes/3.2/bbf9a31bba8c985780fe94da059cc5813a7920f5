ore: Support for short read/writes

Memory conditions and max_bio constraints might cause us to
not comply to the full length of the requested IO. Instead of
failing the complete IO we can issue a shorter read/write and
report how much was actually executed in the ios->length
member.

All users must check ios->length at IO_done or upon return of
ore_read/write and re-issue the reminder of the bytes. Because
other wise there is no error returned like before.

This is part of the effort to support the pnfs-obj layout driver.
