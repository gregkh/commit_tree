[media] s5p-fimc: Convert to use media pipeline operations

In the camera capture driver use fimc_pipeline_* calls provided by
the media device driver part, in place where v4l2_subdev_call() were
used. This way the capture driver don't need to differentiate between
various H/W pipeline setups, i.e. if the MIPI-CSI receiver subdev is
used or not.

Remove the sync_capture_fmt() function instead of which
fimc_pipeline_try_format() is introduced in the following patch adding
the FIMC capture subdev.

The TRY_FMT ioctl function is completed by a subsequent patch adding
the capture subdev, so the try_fmt routines can be reused in the subdev
and the video node ioctl handlers.
