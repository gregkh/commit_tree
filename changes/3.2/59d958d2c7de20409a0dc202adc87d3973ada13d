locking, x86: mce: Annotate cmci_discover_lock as raw

The cmci_discover_lock can be taken in atomic context (cpu bring
up sequence) and therefore cannot be preempted on -rt.

In mainline this change documents the low level nature of
the lock - otherwise there's no functional difference. Lockdep
and Sparse checking will work as usual.
