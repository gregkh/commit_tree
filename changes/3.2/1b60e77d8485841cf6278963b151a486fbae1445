[IA64[ add CONFIG_NET_VENDOR_INTEL=y to default config files where needed

Jeff Kirsher's reorganization of network drivers means that we need
to choose CONFIG_NET_VENDOR_INTEL before options like CONFIG_E100
and CONFIG_E1000 become visible. Fix the minimized ia64 config
files so that we continue to have network drivers in the kernels
that they build.
