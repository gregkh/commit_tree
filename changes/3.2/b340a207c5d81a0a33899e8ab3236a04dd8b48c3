cs89x0: Move the driver into the Cirrus dir

The cs89x0 driver was initial placed in the apple/ when it
should have been placed in the cirrus/.  This resolves the
issue by moving the dirver and fixing up the respective
Kconfig(s) and Makefile(s).

Thanks to Sascha for reporting the issue.

-v2 Fix a config error that was introduced with v1 by removing
    the dependency on MACE for NET_VENDOR_APPLE.
