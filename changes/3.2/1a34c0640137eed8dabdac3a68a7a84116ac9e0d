[SCSI] libsas: fix port->dev_list locking

port->dev_list maintains a list of devices attached to a given sas root port.
It needs to be mutated under a lock as contexts outside of the
single-threaded-libsas-workqueue access the list via sas_find_dev_by_rphy().
Fixup locations where the list was being mutated without a lock.

This is a follow-up to commit 5911e963 "[SCSI] libsas: remove expander
from dev list on error", where Luben noted [1]:

    > 2/ We have unlocked list manipulations in sas_ex_discover_end_dev(),
    > sas_unregister_common_dev(), and sas_ex_discover_end_dev()

    Yes, I can see that and that is very unfortunate.
