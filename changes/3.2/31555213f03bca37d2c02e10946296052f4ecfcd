Revert "hvc_console: display printk messages on console."

This reverts commit 361162459f62dc0826b82c9690a741a940f457f0.

It causes an infinite loop when booting Linux under Xen, as so:

  [    2.382984] console [hvc0] enabled
  [    2.382984] console [hvc0] enabled
  [    2.382984] console [hvc0] enabled
  ...

as reported by Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk.  And Rusty reports the same for
lguest.  He goes on to say:

   "This is not a concurrency problem: the issue seems to be that
    calling register_console() twice on the same struct console is a bad
    idea."

and Greg says he'll fix it up properly at some point later. Revert for now.
