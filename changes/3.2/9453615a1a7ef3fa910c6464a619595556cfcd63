GFS2: Fix lseek after SEEK_DATA, SEEK_HOLE have been added

We need to take the inode's glock whenever the inode's size
is referenced, otherwise it might not be uptodate. Even
though generic_file_llseek_unlocked() doesn't implement
SEEK_DATA, SEEK_HOLE directly, it does reference the inode's
size in those cases, so we need to add them to the list
of origins which need the glock.
