[SCSI] qla2xxx: Remove qla2x00_wait_for_loop_ready function.

This function can wait for 5min under certain scenarios. One of them is when
the port is down from switch and bus reset is issued. The bus reset used to
wait for 5 minutes for the loop and upper layer callers used to hang and give
stack trace because of getting stuck for 120 sec. It is legacy code that was
used when the driver used to do queuing of the commands.
