locking, sched, cgroups: Annotate release_list_lock as raw

The release_list_lock can be taken in atomic context and therefore
cannot be preempted on -rt - annotate it.

In mainline this change documents the low level nature of
the lock - otherwise there's no functional difference. Lockdep
and Sparse checking will work as usual.
