net: allow CAP_NET_RAW to set socket options IP{,V6}_TRANSPARENT

Up till now the IP{,V6}_TRANSPARENT socket options (which actually set
the same bit in the socket struct) have required CAP_NET_ADMIN
privileges to set or clear the option.

- we make clearing the bit not require any privileges.
- we allow CAP_NET_ADMIN to set the bit (as before this change)
- we allow CAP_NET_RAW to set this bit, because raw
  sockets already pretty much effectively allow you
  to emulate socket transparency.
