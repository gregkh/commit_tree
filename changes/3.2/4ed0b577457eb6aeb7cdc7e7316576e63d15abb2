drm/i915: prevent division by zero when asking for chipset power

This prevents an in-kernel division by zero which happens when we are
asking for i915_chipset_val too quickly, or within a race condition
between the power monitoring thread and userspace accesses via debugfs.

The issue can be reproduced easily via the following command:
while ``; do cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_emon_status; done

This is particularly dangerous because it can be triggered by
a non-privileged user by just reading the debugfs entry.

This issue was also found independently by Konstantin Belousov
<kostikbel@gmail.com>, who proposed a similar patch.
