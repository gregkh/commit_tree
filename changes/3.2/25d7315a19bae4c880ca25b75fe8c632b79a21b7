staging:iio:light: V3 fix out of bounds reg_cache[] access

V3 is a straightforward forward port to teh current tree of V2.

Simple fix is to just not cache REG_TEST (offset 8).
Cache doesn't help REG_TEST anyway since we write all 8 bits exactly once
(at resume/init time).

Also fix an "off-by-one" allocation of reg_cache[] array size that
was in the original code before I touched it.
