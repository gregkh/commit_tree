ARM: introduce atag_offset to replace boot_params

The boot_params member of the mdesc structure is used to provide a
default physical address for the ATAG list.  Since this value is fixed
at compile time and sometimes based on constants such as ARCH_PHYS_OFFSET,
it gets in the way of runtime PHYS_OFFSET and CONFIG_ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT
usage.

Let's introduce atag_offset which should contains only the relative
offset from PHYS_OFFSET instead of an absolute value, in preparation
to move all instance of boot_params over to it.
