dm: raid fix device status indicator when array initializing

When devices in a RAID array are not in-sync, they are supposed to be
reported as such in the status output as an 'a' character, which means
"alive, but not in-sync".  But when the entire array is rebuilt 'A' is
being used, which is incorrect.  This patch corrects this to 'a'.
