usb: udc: Fix gadget driver's speed check in various UDC drivers

Several UDC drivers had a gadget driver's speed sanity check of the
form of:

	driver->speed != USB_SPEED_HIGH

or:

	driver->speed != USB_SPEED_HIGH && driver->speed != USB_SPEED_FULL

As more and more gadget drivers support USB SuperSpeed, driver->speed
may be set to USB_SPEED_SUPER and UDC driver should handle such gadget
correctly.  The above checks however fail to recognise USB_SPEED_SUPER
as a valid speed.

This commit changes the two checks to:

	driver->speed < USB_SPEED_HIGH

or:

	driver->speed < USB_SPEED_FULL

respectively.
