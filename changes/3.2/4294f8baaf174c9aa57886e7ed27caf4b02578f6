ARM: gic: add irq_domain support

Convert the gic interrupt controller to use irq domains in preparation
for device-tree binding and MULTI_IRQ. This allows for translation between
GIC interrupt IDs and Linux irq numbers.

The meaning of irq_offset has changed. It now is just the number of skipped
GIC interrupt IDs for the controller. It will be 16 for primary GIC and 32
for secondary GICs.
