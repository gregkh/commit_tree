memory hotplug: Correct page reservation checking

The check to ensure that pages of recently added memory sections are correctly
marked as reserved before trying to online the memory is broken.  The request
to online the memory fails with the following:

kernel: section number XXX page number 256 not reserved, was it already online?

This updates the page reservation checking to check the pages of each memory
section of the memory block being onlined individually.
