netfilter: export NAT definitions through linux/netfilter_ipv4/nf_nat.h

This patch exports several definitions that used to live under
include/net/netfilter/nf_nat.h. These definitions, although not
exported, have been used by iptables and other userspace
applications like miniupnpd since long time. Basically, these
userspace tools included some internal definition of the required
structures and they assume no changes in the binary representation
(which is OK indeed).

To resolve this situation, this patch makes public the required
structure and install them in INSTALL_HDR_PATH.

See: https://bugs.gentoo.org/376873, for more information.

This patch is heavily based on the initial patch sent by:

netfilter: export sanitized nf_nat.h to INSTALL_HDR_PATH
