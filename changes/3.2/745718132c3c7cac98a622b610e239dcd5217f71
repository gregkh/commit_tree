[SCSI] Silencing 'killing requests for dead queue'

When we tear down a device we try to flush all outstanding
commands in scsi_free_queue(). However the check in
scsi_request_fn() is imperfect as it only signals that
we _might start_ aborting commands, not that we've actually
aborted some.
So move the printk inside the scsi_kill_request function,
this will also give us a hint about which commands are aborted.
