sched: fix broken SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK handling

Setting child->prio = current->normal_prio _after_ SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK has
been handled for an RT parent gives birth to a deranged mutant child with
non-RT policy, but RT prio and sched_class.

Move PI leakage protection up, always set priorities and weight, and if the
child is leaving RT class, reset rt_priority to the proper value.
