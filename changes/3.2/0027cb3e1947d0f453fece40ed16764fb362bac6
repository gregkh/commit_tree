PCI: pciehp: wait 1000 ms before Link Training check

We need to wait for 1000 ms after Data Link Layer Link Active (DLLLA)
bit reads 1b before sending configuration request. Currently pciehp
does this wait after checking Link Training (LT) bit. But we need it
before checking LT bit because LT is still set even after DLLLA bit is
set on some platforms.
