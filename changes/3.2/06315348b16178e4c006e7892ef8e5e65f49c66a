serial: Support the EFR-register of XR1715x uarts.

The EFR (Enhenced-Features-Register) is located at a different offset
than the other devices supporting UART_CAP_EFR. This change add a special
setup quick to set UPF_EXAR_EFR on the port. UPF_EXAR_EFR is then used to
the port type to PORT_XR17D15X since it is for sure a XR17D15X uart.
