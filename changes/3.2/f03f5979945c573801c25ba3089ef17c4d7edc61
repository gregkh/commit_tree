tracing/filter: Unify predicate tree walking, change check_pred_tree function to use it

Adding walk_pred_tree function to be used for walking throught
the filter predicates.

For each predicate the callback function is called, allowing
users to add their own functionality or customize their way
through the filter predicates.

Changing check_pred_tree function to use walk_pred_tree.
