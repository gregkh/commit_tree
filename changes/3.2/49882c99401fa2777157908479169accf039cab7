OMAP: omap_device: replace debug/warning/error prints with dev_* macros

For consistency in kernel printk output for devices, use dev_dbg(),
dev_warn(), dev_err() instead of pr_debug(), pr_warning() and
pr_err(), some of which currently use direct access of name from
platform_device and others of which use dev_name().  Using the dev_*
versions uses the standard device naming from the driver core.

Some pr_* prints were not converted with this patch since they are
used before the platform_device and struct device are created so
neither the dev_* prints or dev_name() is valid.
