target: Avoid double list_del for aborted se_tmr_req

After the list_del() in core_tmr_drain_tmr_list(),
core_tmr_release_req() would list_del() the same object again.

Call graph:
        core_tmr_drain_tmr_list
        transport_cmd_finish_abort_tmr
        transport_generic_remove
        transport_free_se_cmd
        core_tmr_release_req

So use list_del_init(), as list_del() of an initialized list_head is
safe and essentially a nop.  In the CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST case, list_del()
actually poisons the list_head, but that is fine as we free the object
directly afterwards.
