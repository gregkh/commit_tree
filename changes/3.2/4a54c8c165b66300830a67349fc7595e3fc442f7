btrfs: Moved repair code from inode.c to extent_io.c

The raid-retry code in inode.c can be generalized so that it works for
metadata as well. Thus, this patch moves it to extent_io.c and makes the
raid-retry code a raid-repair code.

Repair works that way: Whenever a read error occurs and we have more
mirrors to try, note the failed mirror, and retry another. If we find a
good one, check if we did note a failure earlier and if so, do not allow
the read to complete until after the bad sector was written with the good
data we just fetched. As we have the extent locked while reading, no one
can change the data in between.
