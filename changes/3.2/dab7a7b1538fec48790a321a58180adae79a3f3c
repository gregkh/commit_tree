[S390] Add architecture code for unmapping crashkernel memory

This patch implements the crash_map_pages() function for s390.
KEXEC_CRASH_MEM_ALIGN is set to HPAGE_SIZE, in order to support
kernel mappings that use large pages. We also use HPAGE_SIZE alignment
for CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE=n in order to have the same 1 MiB alignment on
all s390 systems.
