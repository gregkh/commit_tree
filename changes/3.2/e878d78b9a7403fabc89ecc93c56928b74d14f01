virtio-net: Verify page list size before fitting into skb

This patch verifies that the length of a buffer stored in a linked list
of pages is small enough to fit into a skb.

If the size is larger than a max size of a skb, it means that we shouldn't
go ahead building skbs anyway since we won't be able to send the buffer as
the user requested.
