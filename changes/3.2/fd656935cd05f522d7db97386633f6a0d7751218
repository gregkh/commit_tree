iwlagn: remove dereferences of priv from transport

There are still quite a few, but much less.
A few fields have been moved /copied to hw_params which sits in the
shared area:
 * priv->cfg->base_params->num_of_ampdu_queues
 * priv->cfg->base_params->shadow_reg_enable
 * priv->cfg->sku
 * priv->ucode_owner
