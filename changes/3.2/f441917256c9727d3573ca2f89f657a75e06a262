ALSA: hda - Revert the check of NO_PRESENCE pincfg default bit

The implementation on commit [08a1f5eb: ALSA: hda - Check NO_PRESENCE
pincfg default bit] seems like a mis-interpretation of specification.
The spec gives the reversed bit definition.  But, following the spec
also causes to change so many existing device configurations, thus we
can't change it so easily for now.  For 3.2-rc1, it's safer to revert
this check (actually this patch comments out the code).

We may re-introduced the fixed version once after the wider test-case
coverages are done.
