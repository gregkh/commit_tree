[SCSI] mpt2sas: Fix drives not getting properly deleted if sas cable is removed while host reset is active

The fix is in the driver-firmware handshake device removal code. We
need to read the controller ioc_state to see if controller is OPERATIONAL
prior to sending target reset and OP_REMOVE. Previously it was checking
the flag ioc->shost_recovery flag, which is always set when host reset is
active, thus preventing drives from getting properly deleted.
