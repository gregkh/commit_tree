igb: fix recent VLAN changes that would leave VLANs disabled after reset

This patch cleans up several issues with VLANs on igb after the recent
changes that were meant to leave the VLANs enabled/disable via the
netdev->features flags.

Specifically the Rx VLAN settings were being dropped after reset due to the
fact that they were not being restored correctly.  In addition I removed
the IRQ disable/enable since those were in place to protect the setting of
vlgrp.
