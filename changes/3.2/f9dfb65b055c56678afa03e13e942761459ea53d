ktest: Check parent options for iterated tests

Let's say we have "OUTPUT_DIR = build/${TEST_NAME}", and we're iterating
a test.  In the second iteration of a test, the TEST_NAME of the test
we're repeating is not used.  Instead, ${TEST_NAME} appears literally:

   touch /home/rabin/kernel/test/build/${TEST_NAME}/.config ... SUCCESS

Fix this by making __eval_option() check the parent test options
for a repeated test.
