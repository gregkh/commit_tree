[SCSI] libsas: sgpio write support

Add SFF-8485 v0.7 / SAS-1 smp-write-gpio register support to libsas.
Defer SAS-2 support unless/until it defines an sgpio interface.

Minimum implementation needed to get the lights blinking.
try_test_sas_gpio_gp_bit() provides a common method to parse the
incoming write data (raw bitstream), and the to_sas_gpio_gp_bit() helper
routine can be used as a basis for the set/clear operations for the
'read' implementation.  Host implementations parse as many bits
(ODx.[012]) as are locally supported and report the number of registers
successfully written.  If the submitted data overruns the internal
number of registers available report the write as a success with the
number of bytes remaining reported in ->resid_len.

Example (assuming an active backplane) set the "identify" pattern for
the first 21 devices:

smp_write_gpio --count=2 --data=92,49,24,92,24,92,49,24 -t 4 --index=1 /dev/bsg/sas_hostX
