ALSA: hdspm - Enable 32 samples/period on RME RayDAT/AIO

Newer RME cards like RayDAT and AIO support 32 samples per period. This
value is encoded as {1,1,1} in the HDSP_LatencyMask bits in the control
register.

Since {1,1,1} is also the representation for 8192 samples/period on
older RME cards, we have to special case 32 samples and 32768 bytes
according to the actual card.
