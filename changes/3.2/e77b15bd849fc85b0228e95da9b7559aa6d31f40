perf tools: Add prelink suggestion to dso update message

Following a prelink run mapped files for long running processes can show
as deleted. The current message suggests restarting long running
processes. Add to that a suggestion that prelink might be the cause.

Old message:
/lib64/libc-2.14.so was updated, restart the long running
 apps that use it!

New message:
/lib64/libc-2.14.so was updated (is prelink enabled?).
  Restart the long running apps that use it!
