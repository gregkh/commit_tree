x86: cache_info: Remove bogus free of amd_l3_cache data

free_cache_attributes() kfree's:

   per_cpu(ici_cpuid4_info, cpu)->l3

which is a pointer to memory which was allocated as a block in
amd_init_l3_cache(). l3 of a particular cpu points to a part of this
memory blob. The part and the rest of the blob are still referenced by
other cpus.

As far as I can tell from the git history this is a leftover from the
conversion from per cpu to node data with commit ba06edb63(x86,
cacheinfo: Make L3 cache info per node) and the following commit
f658bcfb2(x86, cacheinfo: Cleanup L3 cache index disable support)
