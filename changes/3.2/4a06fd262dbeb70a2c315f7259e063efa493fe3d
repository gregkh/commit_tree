xfs: remove i_iocount

We now have an i_dio_count filed and surrounding infrastructure to wait
for direct I/O completion instead of i_icount, and we have never needed
to iocount waits for buffered I/O given that we only set the page uptodate
after finishing all required work.  Thus remove i_iocount, and replace
the actually needed waits with calls to inode_dio_wait.
