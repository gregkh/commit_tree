filter: use unsigned int to silence static checker warning

This is just a cleanup.

My testing version of Smatch warns about this:
net/core/filter.c +380 check_load_and_stores(6)
	warn: check 'flen' for negative values

flen comes from the user.  We try to clamp the values here between 1
and BPF_MAXINSNS but the clamp doesn't work because it could be
negative.  This is a bug, but it's not exploitable.
