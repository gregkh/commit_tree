[media] mceusb: query device for firmware emulator version

Supposedly, there are essentially three different classes of devices
that are compatible with Microsoft's specs. First are the "legacy"
devices, which are built using Microsoft-provided hardware specs and
firmware. Second are "emulator" devices, which are built using custom
hardware and firmware, written to emulate Microsoft's firmware. Third
are "port" devices, which have their own device driver and firmware,
which provides compatible data to higher levels of the stack.

>From what I can tell, things like nuvoton-cir and fintek-cir are
essentially "port" devices -- their raw IR buffer format is very similar
to that of the mceusb devices. Now, within the mceusb driver, we have
three different "generations", which at first, seemed like maybe they
mapped to emulator versions. Unfortuantely, every single device I have
responds "illegal command" to the query to get firmware emulator version
from the hardware, which means they're either all emulator version 1, or
they're legacy devices, and our different "generations" aren't at all
related here. Though in theory, its possible the gen1 devices are
"legacy" devices and the rest are emulator v1. There are some useful
features of the v2 interface I was hoping to play with, but alas...
