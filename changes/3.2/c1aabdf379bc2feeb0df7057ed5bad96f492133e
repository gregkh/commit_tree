can-gw: add netlink based CAN routing

This patch adds a CAN Gateway/Router to route (and modify) CAN frames.

It is based on the PF_CAN core infrastructure for msg filtering and msg
sending and can optionally modify routed CAN frames on the fly.
CAN frames can *only* be routed between CAN network interfaces (one hop).
They can be modified with AND/OR/XOR/SET operations as configured by the
netlink configuration interface known e.g. from iptables. From the netlink
view this can-gw implements RTM_{NEW|DEL|GET}ROUTE for PF_CAN.

The CAN specific userspace tool to manage CAN routing entries can be found in
the CAN utils http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/socketcan/trunk/can-utils/cangw.c
at the SocketCAN SVN on BerliOS.
