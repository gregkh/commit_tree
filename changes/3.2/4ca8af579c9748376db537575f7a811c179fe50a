ASoC: drop support for PlayPaq with WM8510

SoC Audio support for PlayPaq with WM8510 got added in commit 9aaca9683b
("[ALSA] Revised AT32 ASoC Patch"). That support depends on
BOARD_PLAYPAQ. That Kconfig symbol didn't exist when that support got
added in v2.6.27. It still doesn't. It has never been possible to even
build this driver. Drop it.
