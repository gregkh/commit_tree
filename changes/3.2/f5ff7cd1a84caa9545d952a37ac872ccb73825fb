dp83640: use proper function to free transmit time stamping packets

The previous commit enforces a new rule for handling the cloned packets
for transmit time stamping. These packets must not be freed using any other
function than skb_complete_tx_timestamp. This commit fixes the one and only
driver using this API.

The driver first appeared in v3.0.
