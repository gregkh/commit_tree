ARM: pm: no need to save/restore context ID register

There is no need to save and restore the context ID register on ARMv6
and ARMv7 with a temporary page table as we write the context ID
register when we switch back to the real page tables for the thread.

Moreover, the temporary page tables do not contain any non-global
mappings, so the context ID value should not be used.  To be safe,
initialize the register to a reserved context ID value.
