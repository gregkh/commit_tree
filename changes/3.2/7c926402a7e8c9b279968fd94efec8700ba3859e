crypto.h: remove unused crypto_tfm_alg_modname() inline

The <linux/crypto.h> (which is in turn in common headers
like tcp.h) wants to use module_name() in an inline fcn.
But having all of <linux/module.h> along for the ride is
overkill and slows down compiles by a measureable amount,
since it in turn includes lots of headers.

Since the inline is never used anywhere in the kernel[1],
we can just remove it, and then also remove the module.h
include as well.

In all the many crypto modules, there were some relying on
crypto.h including module.h -- for them we now explicitly
call out module.h for inclusion.

[1] git grep shows some staging drivers also define the same
static inline, but they also never ever use it.
