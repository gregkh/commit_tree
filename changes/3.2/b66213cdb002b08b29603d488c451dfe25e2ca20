PM QoS: Add global notification mechanism for device constraints

Add a global notification chain that gets called upon changes to the
aggregated constraint value for any device.
The notification callbacks are passing the full constraint request data
in order for the callees to have access to it. The current use is for the
platform low-level code to access the target device of the constraint.
