pps: new client driver using GPIO

This client driver allows you to use a GPIO pin as a source for PPS
signals.  Platform data [1] are used to specify the GPIO pin number,
label, assert event edge type, and whether clear events are captured.

This driver is based on the work by Ricardo Martins who submitted an
initial implementation [2] of a PPS IRQ client driver to the linuxpps
mailing-list on Dec 3 2010.
