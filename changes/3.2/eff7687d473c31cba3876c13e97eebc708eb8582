hwmon: (w83627ehf) Add support for the W83627UHG

This is essentially a stripped down version of the W83627DHG. Noticeable
difference is that it is still powered with +5V, as older models, even
though the ADC resolution is 8 mV as newer models have.

Thanks to Ulf Bruman (Saab Group) for doing all the testing.
