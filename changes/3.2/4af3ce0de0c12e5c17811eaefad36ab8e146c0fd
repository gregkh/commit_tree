IB/mlx4: Fix shutdown crash accessing a non-existent bitmap

Commit cfcde11c3d7a ("IB/mlx4: Use flow counters on IBoE ports") added
code that sets elements of counters[] to -1 if no counter is allocated,
but then goes ahead and passes every entry to mlx4_counter_free() on
shutdown.  This is a bad idea, especially if MLX4_DEV_CAP_FLAG_COUNTERS
isn't set so there isn't even an underlying bitmap to free from.
