[SCSI] qla4xxx: fix flash/ddb support

With open-iscsi support, target entries persisted in the FLASH were not
login. Added support in the qla4xxx driver to do the login on probe
time to the target entries saved in the FLASH by user.
With this changes upgrade to the new kernel with open-iscsi support in
qla4xxx will ensure users original target entries login on driver load
