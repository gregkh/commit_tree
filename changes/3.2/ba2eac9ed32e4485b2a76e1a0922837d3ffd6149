OMAP: DSS2: add panel-dvi driver

We have currently panel-generic-dpi driver, which is a combined driver
for dummy panels and also for DVI output.

The aim is to split the panel-generic-dpi into two, one for fixed size
dummy panels connected via DPI, and the other (this) for variable
resolution output which supports DDC channel (in practice a DVI framer
chip connected to DPI output).
