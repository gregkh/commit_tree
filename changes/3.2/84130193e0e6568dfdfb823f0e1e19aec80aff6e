ext4: teach ext4_free_blocks() about bigalloc and clusters

The ext4_free_blocks() function now has two new flags that indicate
whether a partial cluster at the beginning or the end of the block
extents should be freed or not.  That will be up the caller (i.e.,
truncate), who can figure out whether partial clusters at the
beginning or the end of a block range can be freed.

We also have to update the ext4_mb_free_metadata() and
release_blocks_on_commit() machinery to be cluster-based, since it is
used by ext4_free_blocks().
