of/irq: of_irq_init: add check for parent equal to child node

With the revert of "of/irq: of_irq_find_parent: check for parent equal to
child" (dc9372808412edb), we need another way to handle parent node equal
to the child node. This can simply be handled in of_irq_init by checking
for this condition.
