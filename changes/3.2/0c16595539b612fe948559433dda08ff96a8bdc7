USB: serial: pl2303: rm duplicate id

I get report from customer that his usb-serial
converter doesn't work well,it sometimes work,
but sometimes it doesn't.

The usb-serial converter's id:
vendor_id product_id
0x4348    0x5523

Then I search the usb-serial codes, and there are
two drivers announce support this device, pl2303
and ch341, commit 026dfaf1 cause it. Through many
times to test, ch341 works well with this device,
and pl2303 doesn't work quite often(it just work quite little).

ch341 works well with this device, so we doesn't
need pl2303 to support.I try to revert 026dfaf1 first,
but it failed. So I prepare this patch by hand to revert it.
