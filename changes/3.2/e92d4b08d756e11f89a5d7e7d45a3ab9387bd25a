ALSA: hda - Rewrite Lenovo X200 quirk with pincfg-fix using auto-parser

Introduce the pincfg table to patch_conexant.c for fixing up the extra
pin-configuration for auto-parser.  As an example, Lenovo X200 model is
replaced with this new mechanism.  (This also fixes the wrong mixer
elements for docking-station I/O in the previous model quirk
automagically.)
