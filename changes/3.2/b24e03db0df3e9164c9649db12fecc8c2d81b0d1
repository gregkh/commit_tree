Btrfs: release trans metadata bytes before flushing delayed refs

We started setting trans->block_rsv = NULL to allow the delayed refs flushing
stuff to use the right block_rsv and then just made
btrfs_trans_release_metadata() unconditionally use the trans block rsv.  The
problem with this is we need to reserve some space in the transaction and then
migrate it to the global block rsv, so we need to be able to free that out
properly.  So instead just move btrfs_trans_release_metadata() before the
delayed ref flushing and use trans->block_rsv for the freeing.  Thanks,
