[libata] Issue SRST to Sil3726 PMP

Reenable sending SRST to devices connected behind a Sil3726 PMP.
This allow staggered spinups and handles drives that spins up slowly.

While the drives spin up, the PMP will not accept SRST.
Most controller reissues the reset until the drive is ready, while
some [Sil3124] returns an error.
In ata_eh_error, wait 10s before reset the ATA port and try again.
