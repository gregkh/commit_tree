MIPS: perf: Reorganize contents of perf support files.

The contents of arch/mips/kernel/perf_event.c and
arch/mips/kernel/perf_event_mipsxx.c were divided in a seemingly ad
hoc manner, with the first including the second.

I moved all the hardware counter support code to perf_event_mipsxx.c
and removed the gating #ifdefs to the Kconfig and Makefile.

Now perf_event.c contains only the callchain support, everything else
is in perf_event_mipsxx.c

There are no code changes, only moving of functions from one file to
the other, or removing empty unneeded functions.
