Btrfs: kill the orphan space calculation for snapshots

This patch kills off the calculation for the amount of space needed for the
orphan operations during a snapshot.  The thing is we only do snapshots on
commit, so any space that is in the block_rsv->freed[] isn't going to be in the
new snapshot anyway, so there isn't any reason to require that space to be
reserved for the snapshot to occur.  Thanks,
