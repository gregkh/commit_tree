drm/i915: Use CK505 as non-SSC source where available

When trying to use SSC on Ibex Peak without CK505, any non-SSC outputs
(like VGA or TV) get broken. So, do not use SSC on Ibex Peak unless
there is a CK505 available (as specified by the VBT).

On Cougar Point, all clocking is internal, so SSC can always be used,
and there will never be a CK505 available.

This eliminates VGA shimmer on some Ironlake machines which have a
CK505 clock source.
