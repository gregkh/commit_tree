udf: Promote some debugging messages to udf_error

If there is a problem with a scratched disc or loader, it's valuable to know
which error occurred.

Convert some debug messages to udf_error, neaten those messages too.
Add the calculated tag checksum and the read checksum to error message.
Make udf_error a public function and move the logging prototypes together.
