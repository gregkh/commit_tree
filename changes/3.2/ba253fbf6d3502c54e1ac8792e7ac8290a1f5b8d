direct-io: inline the complete submission path

Add inlines to all the submission path functions. While this increases
code size it also gives gcc a lot of optimization opportunities
in this critical hotpath.

In particular -- together with some other changes -- this
allows gcc to get rid of the unnecessary clearing of
sdio at the beginning and optimize the messy parameter passing.
Any non inlining of a function which takes a sdio parameter
would break this optimization because they cannot be done if the
address of a structure is taken.

Note that benefits are only seen with CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING
and CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE both set to off.

This gives about 2.2% improvement on a large database benchmark
with a high IOPS rate.
