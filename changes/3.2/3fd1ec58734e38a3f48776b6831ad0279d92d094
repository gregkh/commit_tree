usb/xhci: group MSI interrupt registration into its own function

This patch moves the complete MSI/MSI-X/Legacy dance into its own
function. There is however one difference: If the XHCI_BROKEN_MSI flag
is set then we don't free and register the irq, we simply return.
This is preparation for later PCI decouple.
