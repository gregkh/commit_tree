media/staging: fix allyesconfig build error

Fix x86 allyesconfig builds.  Builds fail due to a non-static variable
named 'debug' in drivers/staging/media/as102:

  arch/x86/built-in.o:arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S:1296: first defined here
  ld: Warning: size of symbol `debug' changed from 90 in arch/x86/built-in.o to 4 in drivers/built-in.o

Thou shalt have no non-static identifiers that are named 'debug'.
