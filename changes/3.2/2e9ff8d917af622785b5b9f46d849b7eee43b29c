linux-next: et131x: Fix build error when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP not enabled

Randy Dunlap reports that the ex131x driver doesn't build when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not enabled.
This bug was introduced when moving code around to remove some forward declarations earlier, the #endif part of #ifdef CONFIG_PM_SLEEP was not moved at the same time. Now fixed by moving it to its proper place.
