sch_gred: should not use GFP_KERNEL while holding a spinlock

gred_change_vq() is called under sch_tree_lock(sch).

This means a spinlock is held, and we are not allowed to sleep in this
context.

We might pre-allocate memory using GFP_KERNEL before taking spinlock,
but this is not suitable for stable material.
