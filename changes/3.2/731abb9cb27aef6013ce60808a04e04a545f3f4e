ip6_tunnel: copy parms.name after register_netdevice

Commit 1c5cae815d removed an explicit call to dev_alloc_name in ip6_tnl_create
because register_netdevice will now create a valid name.  This works for the
net_device itself.

However the tunnel keeps a copy of the name in the parms structure for the
ip6_tnl associated with the tunnel.  parms.name is set by copying the net_device
name in ip6_tnl_dev_init_gen.  That function is called from ip6_tnl_dev_init in
ip6_tnl_create, but it is done before register_netdevice is called so the name
is set to a bogus value in the parms.name structure.

This shows up if you do a simple tunnel add, followed by a tunnel show:

[root@localhost ~]# ip -6 tunnel add remote fec0::100 local fec0::200
[root@localhost ~]# ip -6 tunnel show
ip6tnl0: ipv6/ipv6 remote :: local :: encaplimit 0 hoplimit 0 tclass 0x00 flowlabel 0x00000 (flowinfo 0x00000000)
ip6tnl%d: ipv6/ipv6 remote fec0::100 local fec0::200 encaplimit 4 hoplimit 64 tclass 0x00 flowlabel 0x00000 (flowinfo 0x00000000)
[root@localhost ~]#

Fix this by moving the strcpy out of ip6_tnl_dev_init_gen, and calling it after
register_netdevice has successfully returned.
