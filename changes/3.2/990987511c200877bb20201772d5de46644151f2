rcu: Move rcu_head definition to types.h

Take a first step towards untangling Linux kernel header files by
placing the struct rcu_head definition into include/linux/types.h
and including include/linux/types.h in include/linux/rcupdate.h
where struct rcu_head used to be defined.  The actual inclusion point
for include/linux/types.h is with the rest of the #include directives
rather than at the point where struct rcu_head used to be defined,
as suggested by Mathieu Desnoyers.

Once this is in place, then header files that need only rcu_head
can include types.h rather than rcupdate.h.
