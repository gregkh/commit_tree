Btrfs: don't check bytes_pinned to determine if we should commit the transaction

Before the only reason to commit the transaction to recover space in
reserve_metadata_bytes() was if there were enough pinned_bytes to satisfy our
reservation.  But now we have the delayed inode stuff which will hold it's
reservations until we commit the transaction.  So say we max out our reservation
by creating a bunch of files but don't have any pinned bytes we will ENOSPC out
early even though we could commit the transaction and get that space back.  So
now just unconditionally commit the transaction since currently there is no way
to know how much metadata space is being reserved by delayed inode stuff.
