USB: Update USB default wakeup settings

This patch (as1486) implements the kernel's new wakeup policy for USB
host controllers.  Since they don't generate wakeup requests on their
but merely forward requests from their root hubs toward the CPU, they
should be enabled for wakeup by default.

Also, to be compliant with both the old and new policies, root hubs
should not be enabled for remote wakeup by default.  Userspace must
enable it explicitly if it is desired.
