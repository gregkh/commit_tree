rcu: Make rcu_assign_pointer() unconditionally insert a memory barrier

Recent changes to gcc give warning messages on rcu_assign_pointers()'s
checks that allow it to determine when it is OK to omit the memory
barrier.  Stephen Hemminger tried a number of gcc tricks to silence
this warning, but #pragmas and CPP macros do not work together in the
way that would be required to make this work.

However, we now have RCU_INIT_POINTER(), which already omits this
memory barrier, and which therefore may be used when assigning NULL to
an RCU-protected pointer that is accessible to readers.  This commit
therefore makes rcu_assign_pointer() unconditionally emit the memory
barrier.
