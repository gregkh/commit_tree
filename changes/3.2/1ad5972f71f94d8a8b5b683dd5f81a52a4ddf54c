ALSA: hdspm - Reorder period sizes according to their bit representation

On newer RME cards like RayDAT and AIO, the 8192 samples per period size
are no longer supported. Instead, setting all three bits of
HDSP_LatencyMask to one ({1,1,1}) now corresponds to 32 samples per
period.

To make this more obvious to future developers, let's reorder the array
according to their bit representation, starting at 64 ({0,0,0}) up to
4096 ({1,1,0}) and finally 32 ({1,1,1}).

Note that this patch doesn't change semantics.
