[SCSI] qla4xxx: export address/port of connection (fix udev disk names)

Udev uses the connection's persistent address/port in the
/dev/disk/by-path name. qla4xxx is not exporting this value
so its iscsi disk names have been lacking the iscsi info.
In the old driver we did not have this information but
we do now and can fix this by just setting the flags to tell
libiscsi/scsi_transport_iscsi to export this info in sysfs.
