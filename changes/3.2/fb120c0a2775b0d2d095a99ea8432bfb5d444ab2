ping: dont increment ICMP_MIB_INERRORS

ping module incorrectly increments ICMP_MIB_INERRORS if feeded with a
frame not belonging to its own sockets.

RFC 2011 states that ICMP_MIB_INERRORS should count "the number of ICMP
messages which the entiry received but determined as having
ICMP-specific errors (bad ICMP checksums, bad length, etc.)."
