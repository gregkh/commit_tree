ASoC: twl6040: Lower the power on gain values at startup

The default gains on outputs/inputs are set to 0dB.
This is fixing the pop noise issue at the first playback, which
caused by the wrong starting point of the ramp code.
The ramp code for the outputs expects the gains to be in
their lowest configuration in order to be effective.
After the playback stops, the ramp code takes care of
ramping down the gains to their minimum.
