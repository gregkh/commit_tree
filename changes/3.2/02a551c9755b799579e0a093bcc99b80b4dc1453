USB: option: Removing one bogus and adding some new Huawei combinations

Huawei use the product code HUAWEI_PRODUCT_E353 (0x1506) for a
number of different devices, which each can appear with a number
of different descriptor sets.  Different types of interfaces
can be identified by looking at the subclass and protocol fields

Subclass 1 protocol 8 is actually the data interface of a CDC
ECM set, with subclass 1 protocol 9 as the control interface.
Neither support serial data communcation, and cannot therefore
be supported by this driver.

At the same time, add a few other sets which appear if the
device is configured in "Windows mode" using this modeswitch
