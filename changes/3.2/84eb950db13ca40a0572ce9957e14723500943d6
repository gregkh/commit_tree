x86, ticketlock: Clean up types and accessors

A few cleanups to the way spinlocks are defined and accessed:
 - define __ticket_t which is the size of a spinlock ticket (ie, enough
   bits to hold all the cpus)
 - Define struct arch_spinlock as a union containing plain slock and
   the head and tail tickets
 - Use head and tail to implement some of the spinlock predicates.
 - Make all ticket variables unsigned.
 - Use TICKET_SHIFT to form constants

Most of this will be used in later patches.
