drm: add some comments to drm_wait_vblank and drm_queue_vblank_event

during the review of the fix for locks problems in drm_wait_vblank,
a couple of false concerns were raised about how the drm_vblank_get
and drm_vblank_put are used in this function; it turned out that the
code is correct and that it cannot be simplified

add a few comments to explain non-obvious flows in the code,
to prevent "false alarms" in the future

v2: incorporate comments received from Daniel Vetter
