x86/mce: Make mce_chrdev_ops 'static const'

Arjan would like to make struct file_operations const, but
mce-inject directly writes to the mce_chrdev_ops to install its
write handler. In an ideal world mce-inject would have its own
character device, but we have a sizable legacy of test scripts
that hardwire "/dev/mcelog", so it would be painful to switch to
a separate device now. Instead, this patch switches to a stub
function in the mce code, with a registration helper that
mce-inject can call when it is loaded.

Note that this would also allow for a sane process to allow
mce-inject to be unloaded again (with an unregister function,
and appropriate module_{get,put}() calls), but that is left for
potential future patches.
