fs: add export.h to files using EXPORT_SYMBOL/THIS_MODULE macros

These files were getting <linux/module.h> via an implicit include
path, but we want to crush those out of existence since they cost
time during compiles of processing thousands of lines of headers
for no reason.  Give them the lightweight header that just contains
the EXPORT_SYMBOL infrastructure.
