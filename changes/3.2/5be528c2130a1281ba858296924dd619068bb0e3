Staging: hv: util: kvp: Cleanup kvp_get_domain_name()

Cleanup kvp_get_domain_name(). If getaddrinfo() fails, deal with it properly
(this can happen if no IP address has been assigned). Also, don't specify
a specific service in the call to getaddrinfo() to make this code as generic
as possible. Lastly, move the call to gethostname() after the local variables.
