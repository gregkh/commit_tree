ARM: 7064/1: vexpress: Use wfi macro in platform_do_lowpower.

Current Versatile Express CPU hotplug code includes a hardcoded WFI
instruction, in ARM encoding.  When the kernel is compiled in Thumb-2
mode, this is invalid and causes the machine to hang hard when a CPU
is offlined.

Using the wfi macro (which uses the appropriate assembler mnemonic)
causes the correct instruction to be emitted in either case.  As a
consequence of this change, an apparently vestigial "cc" clobber is
dropped from the asm (the macro uses "memory" only).
