TTY: serial, remove BTM from wait_until_sent

During the BKL removal process, the BKL was switched to tty_lock
(BTM). Now we should start pruning the BTM further. Let's start with
wait_until_sent of the serial layer. This will allow us to switch to
the tty port helpers and thus clean it up much.

In wait_until_sent there are some uport members accessed, but neither
of them is protected by BTM at the location they are set ('=>' means
function call):
* uport->fifosize (set in tty_ioctl => uart_ioctl => uart_set_info)
* uport->type (set in add_one_port prior to tty_register_device)
* uport->timeout (set usually in tty_ioctl => tty_mode_ioctl =>
  tty_set_termios => uart_set_termios => uart_change_speed =>
  uport->ops->set_termios => uart_update_timeout)
* call to uport->ops->tx_empty()

If the tx_empty hook needs some lock to protect accesses to registers,
it should take &uport->lock spinlock like 8250 does. Otherwise there
still might be races e.g. with ISRs.

This should also fix the issue Andreas is seeing (BTM in comparison to
BKL doesn't have any hidden functionality like unlocking during
sleeping).
