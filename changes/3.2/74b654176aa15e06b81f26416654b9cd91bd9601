Blackfin: H8606: fixup bogus ioresource init

IRQF_SHARED is not part of the IORESOURCE_IRQ bits. It's expressed by
IORESOURCE_IRQ_SHAREABLE.

IORESOURCE_IRQ_HIGHEDGE and IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH are contradicting
values, an interrupt can hardly be configured for both level and edge
at the same time. This was introduced in commit 45138439(Blackfin
arch: flash memory map and dm9000 resources updating) of course
without any hint in the changelog what the heck this is supposed to
do.
