GFS2: Make atime checks more efficient

We do not need to start a transaction unless the atime
check has proved positive. Also if we are going to flush
the complete ail list anyway, we might as well skip the
writeback for this specific inode's metadata, since that
will be done as part of the ail writeback process in an
order offering potentially more efficient I/O.
