mtd: nand: report ECC errors properly when reading BBT

Instead of just printing a warning when encountering ECC errors, we
should return a proper error status and print a more informative
warning. Later, we will handle these error messages in the upper layers
of the BBT scan.

Note that this patch makes our check for ECC error codes a little bit
more restrictive, leaving all unrecognized errors to the generic "else"
clause. This shouldn't cause problems and could even be a benefit.

This code is based on some findings reported by Matthieu Castet.
