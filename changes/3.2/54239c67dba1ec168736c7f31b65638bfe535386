ixgbe: combine PCI_VDEVICE and board declaration to same line

This patch is a minor whitespace cleanup to compress the device ID
declaration and board type declaration onto the same line.  It seems to
make sense since all of the combinations of the two are less than 80
characters and it makes the overall layout a bit more readable.
