be2net: remove wrong and unnecessary calls to netif_carrier_off()

1) In be_probe(), as soon as the MCC Q is created a gratuitous link status
event is received and processed. Accordingly netif_carrier_off/on() is called.
The extra netif_carrier_off() call in probe can race with this and cause wrong
state.

2) be_close() need not call netif_carrier_off(). It is OK to show the actual
link state even when the device is administratively down.
