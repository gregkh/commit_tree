usb: musb: fix compilation breakage introduced by de47725

commit de47725 (include: replace linux/module.h
with "struct module" wherever possible) introduced
a compilation breaked when it removed <linux/module.h>
from <linux/device.h> which musb glue layers were
(mistakenly) relying on.

Include that header to fix the compile error.
