ARM: 7076/1: LPAE: Add (pte|pmd)val_t type definitions as u32

This patch defines the (pte|pmd)val_t as u32 and changes the page table
types to be based on these. The PMD bits are converted to the
corresponding type using the _AT macro.

The flush_pmd_entry/clean_pmd_entry argument was changed to (void *) to
allow them to be used with both PGD and PMD pointers and avoid code
duplication.
