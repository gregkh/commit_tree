ARM: S3C24XX: Add devname for hsmmc1 pclk

S3C2443 uses hsmmc1 as its only hsmmc device and for S3C2416/S3C2450
it's the second hsmmc channel with the same PCLKCON bit.
The hsmmc-if clocks on both systems already got a devname, as did
the hsmmc pclk for hsmmc0 on the S3C2416. So to make it possible to
identify the hsmmc1 pclk on S3C2416 add the correct devname for it.
The sclk name on S3C2443 also is s3c-sdhci.1.
