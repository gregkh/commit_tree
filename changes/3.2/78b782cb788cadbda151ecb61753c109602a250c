of: Change logic to overwrite cmd_line with CONFIG_CMDLINE

We used to overwrite with CONFIG_CMDLINE if we found a chosen
node but failed to get bootargs out of it or they were empty,
unless CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE is set.

Instead change that to overwrite if "data" is non empty after
the bootargs check. It allows arch code to have other mechanisms
to retrieve the command line prior to parsing the device-tree.

Note: CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE case should ideally be handled elsewhere
as it won't work as it-is if the device-tree has no /chosen node
