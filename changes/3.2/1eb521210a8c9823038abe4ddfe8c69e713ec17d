rcu: Avoid unnecessary self-wakeup of per-CPU kthreads

There are a number of cases where the RCU can find additional work
for the per-CPU kthread within the context of that per-CPU kthread.
In such cases, the per-CPU kthread is already running, so attempting
to wake itself up does nothing except waste CPU cycles.  This commit
therefore checks to see if it is in the per-CPU kthread context,
omitting the wakeup in this case.
