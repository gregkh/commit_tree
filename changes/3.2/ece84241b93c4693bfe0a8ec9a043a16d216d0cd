block: fix genhd refcounting in blkio_policy_parse_and_set()

blkio_policy_parse_and_set() calls blkio_check_dev_num() to check
whether the given dev_t is valid.  blkio_check_dev_num() uses
get_gendisk() for verification but never puts the returned genhd
leaking the reference.

This patch collapses blkio_check_dev_num() into its caller and updates
it such that the genhd is put before returning.
