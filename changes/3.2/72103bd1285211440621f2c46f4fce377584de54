virtio-pci: fix use after free

Commit 31a3ddda166cda86d2b5111e09ba4bda5239fae6 introduced
a use after free in virtio-pci. The main issue is
that the release method signals removal of the virtio device,
while remove signals removal of the pci device.

For example, on driver removal or hot-unplug,
virtio_pci_release_dev is called before virtio_pci_remove.
We then might get a crash as virtio_pci_remove tries to use the
device freed by virtio_pci_release_dev.

We allocate/free all resources together with the
pci device, so we can leave the release method empty.
