iommu: No need to set dmar_disabled in check_zero_address()

Before the restructruing of the x86 IOMMU code,
intel_iommu_init() was getting called directly from
pci_iommu_init() and hence needed to explicitly set
dmar_disabled to 1 for the failure conditions of
check_zero_address().

Recent changes don't call intel_iommu_init() if the intel iommu
detection fails as a result of failure in check_zero_address().

So no need for this ifdef and the code inside it.
