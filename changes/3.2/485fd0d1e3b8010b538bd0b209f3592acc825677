target: replace ->get_cdb with a target_get_task_cdb helper

Instead of calling out to the backends from the core to get a per-task
CDB and then modify it for the LBA/len pair used for this CDB provide
a helper that writes the adjusted CDB into a provided buffer and call
this method from ->do_task in pscsi.
