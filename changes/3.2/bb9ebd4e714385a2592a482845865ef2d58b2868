mtd: nand: rename NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT

Recall the recently added prefix requirements:
 * "NAND_" for flags in nand.h, used in nand_chip.options
 * "NAND_BBT_" for flags in bbm.h, used in nand_chip.bbt_options
        or in nand_bbt_descr.options

Thus, I am changing NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT to NAND_BBT_USE_FLASH.

Again, this flag is found in bbm.h and so should NOT be used in the
"nand_chip.options" field.
