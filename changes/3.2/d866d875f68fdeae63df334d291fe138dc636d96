ore/exofs: Change the type of the devices array (API change)

In the pNFS obj-LD the device table at the layout level needs
to point to a device_cache node, where it is possible and likely
that many layouts will point to the same device-nodes.

In Exofs we have a more orderly structure where we have a single
array of devices that repeats twice for a round-robin view of the
device table

This patch moves to a model that can be used by the pNFS obj-LD
where struct ore_components holds an array of ore_dev-pointers.
(ore_dev is newly defined and contains a struct osd_dev *od
 member)

Each pointer in the array of pointers will point to a bigger
user-defined dev_struct. That can be accessed by use of the
container_of macro.

In Exofs an __alloc_dev_table() function allocates the
ore_dev-pointers array as well as an exofs_dev array, in one
allocation and does the addresses dance to set everything pointing
correctly. It still keeps the double allocation trick for the
inodes round-robin view of the table.

The device table is always allocated dynamically, also for the
single device case. So it is unconditionally freed at umount.
