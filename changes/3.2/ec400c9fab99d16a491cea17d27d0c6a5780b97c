lis3lv02d: make regulator API usage unconditional

The regulator API contains a range of features for stubbing itself out
when not in use and for transparently restricting the actual effect of
regulator API calls where they can't be supported on a particular system
so that drivers don't need to individually implement this.  Simplify the
driver slightly by making use of this idiom.

The only in tree user is ecovec24 which does not use the regulator API.
