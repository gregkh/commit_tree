kernel: params.c needs module.h not moduleparam.h

Through various other implicit include paths, some files were
getting the full module.h file, and hence living the illusion
that they really only needed moduleparam.h -- but the reality
is that once you remove the module.h presence, these show up:

kernel/params.c:583: warning: ‘struct module_kobject’ declared inside parameter list

Such files really require module.h so simply make it so.  As the
file module.h grabs moduleparam.h on the fly, all will be well.
