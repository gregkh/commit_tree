OMAP: DSS2: DSI: Introduce generic write functions

Intoduce enum "dss_dsi_content_type" to differentiate between DCS and generic
content types.

Introduce short and long packet write functions which use generic
Processor-to-Peripheral transaction types. These are needed by some devices
which may not support corresponding DCS commands. Create common write functions
which allow code reuse between DCS and generic write functions.
