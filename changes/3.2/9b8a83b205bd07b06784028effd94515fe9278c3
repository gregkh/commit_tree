ASoC: Only run power_check() on a widget once per run

Some widgets will get power_check() run on them more than once during a
DAPM run, most commonly due to supply widgets checking to see if their
consumers are powered up. It's wasteful to do this so cache the result
of power_check() during a run. For one system I tested this on I got an
improvement of:

           Power    Path   Neighbour
Before:    106      970    1186
After:     69       727    905

from this.
