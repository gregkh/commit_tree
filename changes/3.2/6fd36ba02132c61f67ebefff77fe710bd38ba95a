x86, ioapic: Only print ioapic debug information for IRQs belonging to an ioapic chip

with "apic=verbose" the print_IO_APIC() function tries to print
IRQ to pin mappings for every active irq. It assumes chip_data
is of type irq_cfg and may cause an oops if not.

As the print_IO_APIC() is called from a late_initcall other
chained irq chips may already be registered with custom
chip_data information, causing an oops. This is the case with
intel MID SoC devices with gpio demuxers registered as irq_chips.
