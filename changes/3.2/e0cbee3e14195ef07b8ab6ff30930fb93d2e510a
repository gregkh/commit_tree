ext4: functions should not be declared extern

The function declarations in ext4.h are already marked extern, so it's
not necessary to do so in the .c files.

This quiets the sparse noise:

warning: function 'ext4_flush_completed_IO' with external linkage has definition
warning: function 'ext4_init_inode_table' with external linkage has definition
