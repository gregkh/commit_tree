ipv6: Fix IPsec slowpath fragmentation problem

ip6_append_data() builds packets based on the mtu from dst_mtu(rt->dst.path).
On IPsec the effective mtu is lower because we need to add the protocol
headers and trailers later when we do the IPsec transformations. So after
the IPsec transformations the packet might be too big, which leads to a
slowpath fragmentation then. This patch fixes this by building the packets
based on the lower IPsec mtu from dst_mtu(&rt->dst) and adapts the exthdr
handling to this.
