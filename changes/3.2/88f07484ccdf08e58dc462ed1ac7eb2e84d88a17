drivers/net/ethernet/*: Enabled vendor Kconfig options

Based on finds for Stephen Rothwell, where current defconfig's
enable a ethernet driver and it is not compiled due to the newly
added NET_VENDOR_* component of Kconfig.

This patch enables all the "new" Kconfig options so that current
defconfig's will continue to compile the expected drivers.  In
addition, by enabling all the new Kconfig options does not add
any un-expected options.
