rt2x00: Fix sleep-while-atomic bug in powersaving code.

The generic powersaving code that determines after reception of a frame
whether the device should go back to sleep or whether is could stay
awake was calling rt2x00lib_config directly from RX tasklet context.
On a number of the devices this call can actually sleep, due to having
to confirm that the sleeping commands have been executed successfully.

Fix this by moving the call to rt2x00lib_config to a workqueue call.
