staging: brcm80211: bugfix for exception on Sparc platforms

Problem would pop up during driver load on a Sun Fire V120 and manifested
itself as an exception. This was caused by int* pointers provided to memcpy()
that were not aligned on an int boundary. The pointer type provided to
memcpy() is used by the compiler for optimization purposes. Fix was to cast
the int* pointers to void* pointers.

Bernhard R. Link and David S. Miller provided valuable feedback, thanks gents.
