PM / Hibernate: Fix the early termination of test modes

Commit 2aede851ddf08666f68ffc17be446420e9d2a056
(PM / Hibernate: Freeze kernel threads after preallocating memory)
postponed the freezing of kernel threads to after preallocating memory
for hibernation. But while doing that, the hibernation test TEST_FREEZER
and the test mode HIBERNATION_TESTPROC were not moved accordingly.

As a result, when using these test modes, it only goes upto the freezing of
userspace and exits, when in fact it should go till the complete end of task
freezing stage, namely the freezing of kernel threads as well.

So, move these points of exit to appropriate places so that freezing of
kernel threads is also tested while using these test harnesses.
