treewide: remove extra semicolons from various parts of the kernel

This is a resend from the original, changing the title from PATCH to
RFC(since this is a review for commit, and I should have put that the first go around).
and also removing some of the commit's with ia64 and bash since it is significant.
let me know if I might have missed anything etc..
