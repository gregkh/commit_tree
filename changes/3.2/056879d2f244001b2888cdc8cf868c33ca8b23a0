ARM: mach-shmobile: sh7372 A3SP no_suspend_console fix

If "no_suspend_irq" is used on the sh7372 Mackerel board
with v3.2-rc1 then Suspend-to-RAM fails because the serial
console tries to write to the SCIF driver even though the
power domain is turned off.

This patch checks the state of "console_suspend_enabled"
to see if A3SP should be forced enabled.
