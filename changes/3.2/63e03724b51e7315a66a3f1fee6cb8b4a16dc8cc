perf script: Add drop monitor script

A while back I created the dropmonitor protocol, which allowed users to get
reports of dropped frames communicated to them via a netlink socket.

While useful, several people have now asked that I integrate the ability
to do drop monitoring with perf, so they don't have to run additional
tools.

This patch adds a drop monitor script to the perf suite, and provides
the same output that the netlink socket does.
