ARM: 7129/1: Add __arm_ioremap_exec for mapping external memory as MT_MEMORY

This allows mapping external memory such as SRAM for use.

This is needed for some small chunks of code, such as reprogramming
SDRAM memory source clocks that can't be executed in SDRAM. Other
use cases include some PM related code.
