powerpc/smp: More generic support for "soft hotplug"

This adds more generic support for doing CPU hotplug with a simple
idle loop and no actual reset of the processors. The generic
smp_generic_kick_cpu() does the hotplug bringup trick if the PACA
shows that the CPU has already been started at boot and we provide
an accessor for the CPU state.
