caif-hsi: Making read and writes asynchronous.

Some platforms do not allow to put HSI block into low-power
mode when FIFO is not empty. The patch flushes (by reading)
FIFO at wake down sequence. Asynchronous read and write is
implemented for that. As a side effect this will also greatly
improve performance.
