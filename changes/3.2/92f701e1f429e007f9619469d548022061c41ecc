ARM: perf: indirect access to cpu_hw_events

Currently, cpu_hw_events is a global per-CPU variable. To enable
support for multiple PMUs, there needs to be a mapping from an instance
of arm_pmu to its cpu_hw_events. Additionally, as system PMUs are not
CPU-affine, they should not have this stored per-CPU.

This patch moves access to the hardware events data behind an accessor
function (arm_pmu::get_hw_events). This allows each instance to have
its own hardware event data, which can be stored per-CPU or globally as
required.
