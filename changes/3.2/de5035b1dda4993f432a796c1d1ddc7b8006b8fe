ASoC: wm8900: Fix the mask defines

Now we have done bitwise NOT against the mask bits for the defines of
WM8900_REG_CLOCKING1_BCLK_MASK,
WM8900_REG_CLOCKING1_OPCLK_MASK and WM8900_LRC_MASK.

But we don't have the bitwise NOT against the mask bits for the defines of
WM8900_REG_CLOCKING2_DAC_CLKDIV,
WM8900_REG_CLOCKING2_ADC_CLKDIV and WM8900_REG_DACCTRL_AIF_LRCLKRATE.

It is error prone to mix the inconsistent meaning for different mask defines.
So lets make the defines for each mask to be corresponding to the bits
defines in datasheet. Don't add extra "bitwise NOT" to the defines.
