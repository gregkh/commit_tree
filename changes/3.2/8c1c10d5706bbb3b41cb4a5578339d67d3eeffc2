Input: serio_raw - kick clients when disconnecting port

Send SIGIO/POLL_HUP and otherwise wake up waiters when corresponding serio
port is being disconnected. Also check if port is dead in serio_raw_poll
and signal POLLHUP|POLLERR.

This should speed up process of releasing dead devices by userspace
applications.
