xfs: call xfs_buf_delwri_queue directly

Unify the ways we add buffers to the delwri queue by always calling
xfs_buf_delwri_queue directly.  The xfs_bdwrite functions is removed and
opencoded in its callers, and the two places setting XBF_DELWRI while a
buffer is locked and expecting xfs_buf_unlock to pick it up are converted
to call xfs_buf_delwri_queue directly, too.  Also replace the
XFS_BUF_UNDELAYWRITE macro with direct calls to xfs_buf_delwri_dequeue
to make the explicit queuing/dequeuing more obvious.
