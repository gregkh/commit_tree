btrfs: keep orphans for subvolume deletion

Since we have the free space caches, btrfs_orphan_cleanup also runs for
the tree_root. Unfortunately this also cleans up the orphans used to mark
subvol deletions in progress.

Currently if a subvol deletion gets interrupted twice by umount/mount, the
deletion will not be continued and the space permanently lost, though it
would be possible to write a tool to recover those lost subvol deletions.
This patch checks if the orphan belongs to a subvol (dead root) and skips
the deletion.
