s390: add missing module.h/export.h includes

Fix several compile errors on s390 caused by splitting module.h.

Some include additions [e.g. qdio_setup.c, zfcp_qdio.c] are in
anticipation of pending changes queued for s390 that increase
the modular use footprint.

[PG: added additional obvious changes since Heiko's original patch]
