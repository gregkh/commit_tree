be2net: add vlan/rx-mode/flow-control config to be_setup()

When a card is reset due to EEH error recovery or due to a suspend,
rx-mode config (promisc/mc) is not being sent to the FW. be_setup() is
called in these flows and is the best place for such config/re-config
cmds. Hence include rx-mode, vlan and flow-control config in
be_setup().
