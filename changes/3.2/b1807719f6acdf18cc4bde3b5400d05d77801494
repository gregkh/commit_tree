HID: Correct General touch PID

Genera Touch told us that 0001 is their single point device
and 0003 is the multitouch one. Apparently, we made the tests
someone having a prototype, and not the final product.
They said it should be safe to do the switch.

This partially reverts 5572da0 ("HID: hid-mulitouch: add support
for the 'Sensing Win7-TwoFinger'").
