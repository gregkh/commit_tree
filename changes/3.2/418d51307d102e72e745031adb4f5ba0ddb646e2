RDMA/core: Add XRC SRQ type

XRC ("eXtended reliable connected") is an IB transport that provides
better scalability by allowing senders to specify which shared receive
queue (SRQ) should be used to receive a message, which essentially
allows one transport context (QP connection) to serve multiple
destinations (as long as they share an adapter, of course).

XRC defines SRQs that are specifically used by XRC connections.  Expand
the SRQ code to support XRC SRQs.  An XRC SRQ is currently restricted to
only XRC use according to the IB XRC Annex.
