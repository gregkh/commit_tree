USB: EHCI: remove usages of hcd->state

This patch (as1483) improves the ehci-hcd driver family by getting rid
of the reliance on the hcd->state variable.  It has no clear owner and
it isn't protected by the usual HCD locks.  In its place, the patch
adds a new, private ehci->rh_state field to record the state of the
root hub.

Along the way, the patch removes a couple of lines containing
redundant assignments to the state variable.  Also, the QUIESCING
state simply gets changed to the RUNNING state, because the driver
doesn't make any distinction between them.
