IB/qib: Fix over-scheduling of QSFP work

Don't over-schedule QSFP work on driver initialization.  It could end
up being run simultaneously on two different CPUs resulting in bad
EEPROM reads.  In combination with setting the physical IB link state
prior to the IBC being brought out of reset, this can cause the link
state machine to start training early with wrong settings.
