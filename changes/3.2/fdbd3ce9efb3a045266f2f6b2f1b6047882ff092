PCI: pciehp: Retrieve link speed after link is trained

During hot plug, board_added will call pciehp_power_on_slot().
But link speed is updated in pciehp_power_on_slot().

We should not update link speed there, because that is too early.

So move the link speed update to pciehp_check_link_status() after making
sure the link has been trained.

-v2: fix compile warning that Kenji found.
