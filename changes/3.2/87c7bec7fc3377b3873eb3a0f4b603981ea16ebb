xfs: fix buffer flushing during unmount

The code to flush buffers in the umount code is a bit iffy: we first
flush all delwri buffers out, but then might be able to queue up a
new one when logging the sb counts.  On a normal shutdown that one
would get flushed out when doing the synchronous superblock write in
xfs_unmountfs_writesb, but we skip that one if the filesystem has
been shut down.

Fix this by moving the delwri list flushing until just before unmounting
the log, and while we're at it also remove the superflous delwri list
and buffer lru flusing for the rt and log device that can never have
cached or delwri buffers.
