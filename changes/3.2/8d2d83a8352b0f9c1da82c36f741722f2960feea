exofs: Remove unused data_map member from exofs_sb_info

The struct pnfs_osd_data_map data_map member of exofs_sb_info was
never used after mount. In fact all it's members were duplicated
by the ore_layout structure. So just remove the duplicated information.

Also removed some stupid, but perfectly supported, restrictions on
layout parameters. The case where num_devices is not divisible by
mirror_count+1 is perfectly fine since the rotating device view
will eventually use all the devices it can get.
