drm/i915: Fix inconsistent backlight level during disabled

When the brightness property is inquired while the backlight is disabled,
the driver returns a wrong value (zero) because it probes the value after
the backlight was turned off.  This caused a black screen even after the
backlight is enabled again.  It should return the internal backlight_level
instead, so that it won't be influenced by the backlight-enable state.
