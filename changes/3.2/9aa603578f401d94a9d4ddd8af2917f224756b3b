ath6kl: Fix crash during the connection process

Sometimes, the network manager is failing to connect to the AP due
to the below kernel crash message. The reason behind this,
after issuing the connect command to the chip, the chip is sending
disconnect event and then immediately one connect event to the host
in some random cases.

The host driver resets all states (including cfg80211 state machine)
when it receives disconnect event from the chip. But, still the host
driver reports the next received connect event to cfg80211, at that time
cfg80211 SME state would have been in IDLE state, which was causing
the below kernel crash.

Now, host driver's sme state machine is checked every time before
delivering connect event to cfg80211
