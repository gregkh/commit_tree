ASoC: twl6040: Request core to inline the DAPM sequence

We need to have as less time between McPDM shutdown,
and power down of the DAC on the twl6040 codec as possible.
Request core to ignore the pmdown_time for the playback
stream.
Backround: with the McPDM protocol we are sendning not only
the pure audio stream, but OMAP McPDM also transmits
additional information (for example offset cancellation).
If McPDM is stopped prior to the DAC this information will
be not sent to the codec, which can result noise rendered
by the twl6040 codec.
