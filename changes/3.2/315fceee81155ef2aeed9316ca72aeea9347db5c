block: drop unnecessary blk_get/put_queue() in scsi_cmd_ioctl() and blk_get_tg()

blk_get/put_queue() in scsi_cmd_ioctl() and throtl_get_tg() are
completely bogus.  The caller must have a reference to the queue on
entry and taking an extra reference doesn't change anything.

For scsi_cmd_ioctl(), the only effect is that it ends up checking
QUEUE_FLAG_DEAD on entry; however, this is bogus as queue can die
right after blk_get_queue().  Dead queue should be and is handled in
request issue path (it's somewhat broken now but that's a separate
problem and doesn't affect this one much).

throtl_get_tg() incorrectly assumes that q is rcu freed.  Also, it
doesn't check return value of blk_get_queue().  If the queue is
already dead, it ends up doing an extra put.

Drop them.
