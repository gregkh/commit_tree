staging: mei: clean the TODO file from done tasks.

1) We move the AMT Watchdog to use the kernel watchdog core.
the new code is still part of the MEI driver.
we didn't find any good reason to extract the the MEI driver watchdog code
from the MEI Driver to a new module.

2) Since the watchdog remains in the mei driver, exposing in-kernel
API just for AMTHI is unnecessary.

MEI new Watchdog Core Interface Patches set:

3) Code cleanup (init and probe, bug_on usage, headers and etc) was
submitted in previous patches.
