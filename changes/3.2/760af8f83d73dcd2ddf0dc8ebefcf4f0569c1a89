drivers/video: fsl-diu-fb: add several new video modes

Add the following new video modes to the Freescale DIU framebuffer driver:

640x480x60
640x480x72
640x480x75
640x480x90
640x480x100
800x480x60
800x600x60
854x480x60
1280x480x60
1280x720x60
1920x1080x60

Also add margin data to the 320x240 video mode.  This mode was originally
intended only for the AOIs (overlays) used on planes two and three, but with
real margin data, it can now be used as an actual video mode.
Video mode data is from earlier work done by Jerry Huang
