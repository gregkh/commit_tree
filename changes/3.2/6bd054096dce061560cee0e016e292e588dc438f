ARM: 7185/1: perf: don't assign platform_device on unsupported CPUs

In the unlikely case that a platform registers a PMU platform_device
when running on a CPU that is unsupported by perf, we will encounter a
NULL dereference when trying to assign the platform_device to the
cpu_pmu structure.

This patch checks that the CPU is supported by perf before assigning
the platform_device.
