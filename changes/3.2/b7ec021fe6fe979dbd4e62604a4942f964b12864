[SCSI] hpsa: fix potential array overflow in hpsa_update_scsi_devices

The currentsd[] array in hpsa_update_scsi_devices had room for
256 devices.  The code was iterating over however many physical
and logical devices plus an additional number of possible external
MSA2XXX controllers, which together could potentially exceed 256.

We increased the size of the currentsd array to 1024 + 1024 + 32 + 1
elements to reflect a reasonable maximum possible number of devices
which might be encountered.  We also don't just walk off the end
of the array if the array controller reports more devices than we
are prepared to handle, we just ignore the excessive devices.
