NFSD: Cleanup for nfsd4_path()

The current code is sort of hackish in that it assumes a referral is always
matched to an export. When we add support for junctions that may not be the
case.
We can replace nfsd4_path() with a function that encodes the components
directly from the dentries. Since nfsd4_path is currently the only user of
the 'ex_pathname' field in struct svc_export, this has the added benefit
of allowing us to get rid of that.
