SUNRPC: introduce helpers for reference counted rpcbind clients

v6:
1) added write memory barrier to rpcb_set_local to make sure, that rpcbind
clients become valid before rpcb_users assignment
2) explicitly set rpcb_users to 1 instead of incrementing it (looks clearer from
my pow).

v5: fixed races with rpcb_users in rpcb_get_local()

This helpers will be used for dynamical creation and destruction of rpcbind
clients.
Variable rpcb_users is actually a counter of lauched RPC services. If rpcbind
clients has been created already, then we just increase rpcb_users.
