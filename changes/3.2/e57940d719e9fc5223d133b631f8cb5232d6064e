ipc/sem.c: remove private structures from public header file

include/linux/sem.h contains several structures that are only used within
ipc/sem.c.

The patch moves them into ipc/sem.c - there is no need to expose the
structures to the whole kernel.

No functional changes, only whitespace cleanups and 80-char per line
fixes.
