mmc: core: eMMC 4.5 Power Class Selection Feature

This patch adds the power class selection feature available for mmc
versions 4.0 and above.  During the enumeration stage before switching
to the lower data bus, check if the power class is supported for the
current bus width. If the power class is available then switch to the
power class and use the higher data bus. If power class is not supported
then switch to the lower data bus in a worst case.
