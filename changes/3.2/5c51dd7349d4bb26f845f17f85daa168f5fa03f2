rcu: Prevent early boot set_need_resched() from __rcu_pending()

There isn't a whole lot of point in poking the scheduler before there
are other tasks to switch to.  This commit therefore adds a check
for rcu_scheduler_fully_active in __rcu_pending() to suppress any
pre-scheduler calls to set_need_resched().  The downside of this approach
is additional runtime overhead in a reasonably hot code path.
