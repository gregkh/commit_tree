ARM: 7068/1: process: change from __backtrace to dump_stack in show_regs

Currently, show_regs calls __backtrace which does
nothing if CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is not set. Switch to
dump_stack which handles both CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER and
CONFIG_ARM_UNWIND correctly.

__backtrace is now superseded by dump_stack in general
and show_regs was the last caller so remove __backtrace
as well.
