pata_pdc2027x: add Power Management support

Fixes IDE -> libata regression.

There shouldn't be any problems with it as corresponding IDE's host
driver (pdc202xx_new) has been supporting PCI Power Management since
Oct 10 2008 (commit feb22b7f "ide: add proper PCI PM support (v2)")
and IDE PM since Jun 14 2003 (patch v2.5.73 "ide: Power Management").
