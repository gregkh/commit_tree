bnx2x: Coalesce pr_cont uses and fix DP typos

Uses of pr_cont should be avoided where reasonably possible
because they can be interleaved by other threads and processes.

Coalesce pr_cont uses.

Fix typos, duplicated words and spacing in DP uses caused
by split multi-line formats.  Coalesce some of these
split formats.  Add missing terminating newlines to DP uses.
