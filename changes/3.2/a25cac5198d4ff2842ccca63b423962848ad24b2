proc: Consider NO_HZ when printing idle and iowait times

show_stat handler of the /proc/stat file relies on kstat_cpu(cpu)
statistics when priting information about idle and iowait times.
This is OK if we are not using tickless kernel (CONFIG_NO_HZ) because
counters are updated periodically.
With NO_HZ things got more tricky because we are not doing idle/iowait
accounting while we are tickless so the value might get outdated.
Users of /proc/stat will notice that by unchanged idle/iowait values
which is then interpreted as 0% idle/iowait time. From the user space
POV this is an unexpected behavior and a change of the interface.

Let's fix this by using get_cpu_{idle,iowait}_time_us which accounts the
total idle/iowait time since boot and it doesn't rely on sampling or any
other periodic activity. Fall back to the previous behavior if NO_HZ is
disabled or not configured.
