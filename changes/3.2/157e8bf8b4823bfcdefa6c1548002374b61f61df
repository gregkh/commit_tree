Revert "rtc: Disable the alarm in the hardware"

This reverts commit c0afabd3d553c521e003779c127143ffde55a16f.

It causes failures on Toshiba laptops - instead of disabling the alarm,
it actually seems to enable it on the affected laptops, resulting in
(for example) the laptop powering on automatically five minutes after
shutdown.

There's a patch for it that appears to work for at least some people,
but it's too late to play around with this, so revert for now and try
again in the next merge window.

See for example
