[SCSI] iscsi class: sysfs group is_visible callout for iscsi host attrs

The iscsi class currently does not support writable sysfs
attrs for LLD sysfs settings. This patch converts the
iscsi class and driver's host attrs to use the attribute
container sysfs group and the sysfs group's is_visible callout
to be able to support readable or writable sysfs attrs.
