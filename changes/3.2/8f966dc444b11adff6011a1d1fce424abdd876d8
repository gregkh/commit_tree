staging: vme: add struct vme_dev for VME devices

Instead of using a vanilla 'struct device' for VME devices, add new
'struct vme_dev'. Modifications have been made to the VME framework
API as well as all in-tree VME drivers.

The new vme_dev structure has the following advantages from the
current model used by the driver:

    * Driver functions (probe, remove) now receive a VME device
      instead of a pointer to the bridge device (cleaner design)
    * It's easier to differenciate API calls as bridge-based or
      device-based (ie. cleaner interface).
