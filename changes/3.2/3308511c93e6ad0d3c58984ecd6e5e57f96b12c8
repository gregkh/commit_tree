[SCSI] Make scsi_free_queue() kill pending SCSI commands

Make sure that SCSI device removal via scsi_remove_host() does finish
all pending SCSI commands. Currently that's not the case and hence
removal of a SCSI host during I/O can cause a deadlock. See also
"blkdev_issue_discard() hangs forever if underlying storage device is
removed" (http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40472). See also
