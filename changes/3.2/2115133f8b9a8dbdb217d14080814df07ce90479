Btrfs: tweak the delayed inode reservations again

Josef sent along an incremental to the inode reservation
code to make sure we try and fall back to directly updating
the inode item if things go horribly wrong.

This reworks that patch slightly, adding a fallback function
that will always try to update the inode item directly without
going through the delayed_inode code.
