drm/i915: Enable dither whenever display bpc < frame buffer bpc

We want to enable dithering on any pipe where the frame buffer has
more color resolution than the output device.

The previous code was incorrectly clamping the frame buffer bpc to the
display bpc, effectively disabling dithering all of the time as the
computed frame buffer bpc would never be larger than the display bpc.
