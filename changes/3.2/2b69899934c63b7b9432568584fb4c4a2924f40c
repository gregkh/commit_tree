xhci: USB 3.0 BW checking.

The Intel Panther Point xHCI host tracks SuperSpeed endpoints in a
different way than USB 2.0/1.1 endpoints.  The bandwidth interval tables
are not used, and instead the bandwidth is calculated in a very simple
way.  Bandwidth for SuperSpeed endpoints is tracked individually in each
direction, since each direction has the full USB 3.0 bandwidth available.
10% of the bus bandwidth is reserved for non-periodic transfers.

This checking would be more complex if we had USB 3.0 LPM enabled, because
an additional latency for isochronous ping times need to be taken into
account.  However, we don't have USB 3.0 LPM support in Linux yet.
