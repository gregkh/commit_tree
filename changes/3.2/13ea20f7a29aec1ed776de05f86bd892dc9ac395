x86, msi, intr-remap: Use the ioapic set affinity routine

IRQ set affinity routine is same for the IO-APIC IRQ's aswell as
the MSI IRQ's in the presence of interrupt-remapping. This is
because we modify the interrupt-remapping table entry and
doesn't touch the IO-APIC RTE or the MSI entry.

So remove the ir_msi_set_affinity() and re-use the
ir_ioapic_set_affinity()
