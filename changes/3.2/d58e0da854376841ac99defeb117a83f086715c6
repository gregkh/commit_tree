TOMOYO: Add environment variable name restriction support.

This patch adds support for checking environment variable's names.
Although TOMOYO already provides ability to check argv[]/envp[] passed to
execve() requests,

  file execute /bin/sh exec.envp["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]="bar"

will reject execution of /bin/sh if environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not
defined. To grant execution of /bin/sh if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not defined,
administrators have to specify like

  file execute /bin/sh exec.envp["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]="/system/lib"
  file execute /bin/sh exec.envp["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]=NULL

. Since there are many environment variables whereas conditional checks are
applied as "&&", it is difficult to cover all combinations. Therefore, this
patch supports conditional checks that are applied as "||", by specifying like

  file execute /bin/sh
  misc env LD_LIBRARY_PATH exec.envp["LD_LIBRARY_PATH"]="/system/lib"

which means "grant execution of /bin/sh if environment variable is not defined
or is defined and its value is /system/lib".
