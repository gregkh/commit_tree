ASoC: Fix build dependency for SND_SOC_JZ4740_CODEC

Currently SND_SOC_JZ4740_CODEC depends on SOC_JZ4740 but SOC_JZ4740 is not
defined in any Kconfig. Thus the codec driver will not be built when select
"Build all ASoC CODEC drivers".
(Unless it is selected by SND_JZ4740_SOC_QI_LB60).
Remove the dependency with SOC_JZ4740, then this code driver can be built when
select "Build all ASoC CODEC drivers".
