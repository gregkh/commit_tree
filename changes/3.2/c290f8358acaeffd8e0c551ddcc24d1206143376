TTY: drop driver reference in tty_open fail path

When tty_driver_lookup_tty fails in tty_open, we forget to drop a
reference to the tty driver. This was added by commit 4a2b5fddd5 (Move
tty lookup/reopen to caller).

Fix that by adding tty_driver_kref_put to the fail path.

I will refactor the code later. This is for the ease of backporting to
stable.
