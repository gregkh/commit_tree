m68knommu: fix problems with SPI/GPIO on ColdFire 520x

The problem has its root in the calculation of the set-port offsets (macro
MCFGPIO_SETR() in arch/m68k/include/asm/gpio.h), this assumes that all ports
have the same offset from the base port address (MCFGPIO_SETR) which is
defined in mcf520xsim.h as an alias of MCFGIO_PSETR_BUSCTL. Because the BUSCTL
and BE port do not have a set-register (see MCF5208 Reference Manual Page
13-10, Table 13-3) the offset calculations went wrong.

Because the BE and BUSCTL port do not seem useful in these parts, as they
lack a set register, I removed them and adapted the gpio chip bases which
are also used for the offset-calculations. Now both setting and resetting
the chip selects works as expected from userland and from the kernelspace.
