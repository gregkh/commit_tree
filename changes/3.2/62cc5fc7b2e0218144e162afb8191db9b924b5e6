xen/pv-on-hvm kexec: rebind virqs to existing eventchannel ports

During a kexec boot some virqs such as timer and debugirq were already
registered by the old kernel.  The hypervisor will return -EEXISTS from
the new EVTCHNOP_bind_virq request and the BUG in bind_virq_to_irq()
triggers.  Catch the -EEXISTS error and loop through all possible ports to find
what port belongs to the virq/cpu combo.
