igb: Replace E1000_XX_DESC_ADV with IGB_XX_DESC

Since igb only uses advanced descriptors we might as well just use an IGB
specific define and drop the _ADV suffix for the descriptor declarations.
In addition this can be further reduced by assuming that it will be working
on pointers since that is normally how the Tx descriptors are handled.
