mtd: wr_sbc82xx_flash.c: use mtd_device_parse_register

Replace custom invocations of parse_mtd_partitions and mtd_device_register
with common mtd_device_parse_register call. This would bring: standard
handling of all errors, fallback to default partitions, etc.

Artem: some tweaks, split one very long line while on it.
