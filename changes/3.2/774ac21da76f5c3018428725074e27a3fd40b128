ceph: initialize root dentry

Set up d_fsdata on the root dentry.  This fixes a NULL pointer dereference
in ceph_d_prune on umount.  It also means we can eventually strip out all
of the conditional checks on d_fsdata because it is now set unconditionally
(prior to setting up the d_ops).

Fix the ceph_d_prune debug print while we're here.
