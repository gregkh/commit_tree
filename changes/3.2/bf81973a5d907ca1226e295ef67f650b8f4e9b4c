[SCSI] scsi_dh_alua: Add one more check-condition for alua handler

This patch adds one more check-condition for scsi_dh_alua handler. Without
this, the handler attach fails sometimes during the discovery. I have noticed
this with NetApp E-Series storage with alua mode. Also removed some
unnecessary brackets {} for consistency.
