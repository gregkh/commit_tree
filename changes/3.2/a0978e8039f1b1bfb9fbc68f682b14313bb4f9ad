ALSA: firewire-speakers: fix locking

There is a lock inversion between fwspk->mutex and pcm->open_mutex
reported by lockdep when fwspk_hw_free is called.

Fixed by copying the fix from the same former issue in the isight
sound driver (commit f3f7c1837f6bcae3601fc535b339426868bf1549
"ALSA: isight: fix locking").
