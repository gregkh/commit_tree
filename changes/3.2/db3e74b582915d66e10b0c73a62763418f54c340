xfs: use doalloc flag in xfs_qm_dqattach_one()

The doalloc arg in xfs_qm_dqattach_one() is a flag that indicates
whether a new area to handle quota information will be allocated
if needed. Originally, it was passed to xfs_qm_dqget(), but has
been removed by the following commit (probably by mistake):

	xfs: remove the unused XFS_QMOPT_DQLOCK flag

As the result, xfs_qm_dqget() called from xfs_qm_dqattach_one()
never allocates the new area even if it is needed.

This patch gives the doalloc arg to xfs_qm_dqget() in
xfs_qm_dqattach_one() to fix this problem.
