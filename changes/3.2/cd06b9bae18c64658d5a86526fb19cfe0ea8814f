[SCSI] isci: SATA/STP I/O is only returned in the normal path to libsas

Since libsas has it's own means to escalate SATA/STP device error
handling depending on task status codes, return all SATA/STP I/O
on the normal path.

i.e. skip sas_task_abort() and let sas_ata_task_done() disposition the
qc.  Longer term we want to audit non-essential calls to
sas_task_abort().
