ARM: pm: get rid of cpu_resume_turn_mmu_on

We don't require cpu_resume_turn_mmu_on as we can combine the ldr
instruction with the following code provided we ensure that
cpu_resume_mmu is aligned for older CPUs.  Note that we also align
to a 32-byte boundary to ensure that the code can't cross a section
boundary.
