ore/exofs: Define new ore_verify_layout

All users of the ore will need to check if current code
supports the given layout. For example RAID5/6 is not
currently supported.

So move all the checks from exofs/super.c to a new
ore_verify_layout() to be used by ore users.

Note that any new layout should be passed through the
ore_verify_layout() because the ore engine will prepare
and verify some internal members of ore_layout, and
assumes it's called.
