ARM: perf: de-const struct arm_pmu

This patch removes const qualifiers from instances of struct arm_pmu,
and functions initialising them, in preparation for generalising
arm_pmu usage to system (AKA uncore) PMUs.

This will allow for dynamically modifiable structures (locks,
struct pmu) to be added as members of struct arm_pmu.
