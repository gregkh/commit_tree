[media] DiBcom: protect the I2C bufer access

This patch protects the I2C buffer access in order to manage concurrent
access. This protection is done using mutex.
Furthermore, for the dib9000, if a pid filtering command is
received during the tuning, this pid filtering command is delayed to
avoid any concurrent access issue.
