    usb/isp1760: Let OF bindings depend on general CONFIG_OF instead of PPC_OF .

    To be able to use the driver on other OF-aware architectures, too.
    And add necessary OF related #includes to fix compilation error.

enabled the build on all CONFIG_OF architectures, but it cannot do
this.

This driver depends upon CONFIG_OF_IRQ but not all CONFIG_OF platforms
support that infrastructure, in particular Sparc does not so the
build fails.

Please push a patch like the following to Linus so that this code only
gets built where it actually should.
