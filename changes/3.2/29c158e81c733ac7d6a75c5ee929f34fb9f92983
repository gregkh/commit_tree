nohz: Remove "Switched to NOHz mode" debugging messages

When performing cpu hotplug tests the kernel printk log buffer gets flooded
with pointless "Switched to NOHz mode..." messages. Especially when afterwards
analyzing a dump this might have removed more interesting stuff out of the
buffer.
Assuming that switching to NOHz mode simply works just remove the printk.
