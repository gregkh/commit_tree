Input: synaptics - fix touchpad not working after S2R on Vostro V13

Synaptics touchpads on several Dell laptops, particularly Vostro V13
systems, may not respond properly to PS/2 commands and queries immediately
after resuming from suspend to RAM. This leads to unresponsive touchpad
after suspend/resume cycle.

Adding a 1-second delay after resetting the device allows touchpad to
finish initializing (calibrating?) and start reacting properly.
