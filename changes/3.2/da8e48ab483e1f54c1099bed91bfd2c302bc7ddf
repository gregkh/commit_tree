hwmon: (pmbus) Always call _pmbus_read_byte in core driver

Always call _pmbus_read_byte() instead of pmbus_read_byte() in PMBus core
driver. With this change, device specific read functions can be implemented for
all registers.

Since the device specific read_byte function is now always called, we need to be
more careful with page validations. Only fail if the passed page number is larger
than 0, since -1 means "current page".
