i2c: add export.h to i2c-boardinfo.c for EXPORT_SYMBOL

With module.h being implicitly everywhere via device.h, the absence
of explicitly including something for EXPORT_SYMBOL went unnoticed.
Since we are heading to fix things up and clean module.h from the
device.h file, we need to explicitly include these files now.
