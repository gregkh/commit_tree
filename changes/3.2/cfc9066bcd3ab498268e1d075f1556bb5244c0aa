[S390] remove reset of system call restart on psw changes

git commit 20b40a794baf3b4b "signal race with restarting system calls"
added code to the poke_user/poke_user_compat to reset the system call
restart information in the thread-info if the PSW address is changed.
The purpose of that change has been to workaround old gdbs that do
not know about the REGSET_SYSTEM_CALL. It turned out that this is not
a good idea, it makes the behaviour of the debuggee dependent on the
order of specific ptrace call, e.g. the REGSET_SYSTEM_CALL register
set needs to be written last. And the workaround does not really fix
old gdbs, inferior calls on interrupted restarting system calls do not
work either way.
