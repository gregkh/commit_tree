miscdevice.h: fix up implicit use of lists and types

By removing the implicit presence of module.h from this file, we
will see things like:

In file included from fs/dlm/user.c:9:
include/linux/miscdevice.h:50: error: field ‘list’ has incomplete type
include/linux/miscdevice.h:54: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘mode_t’

Call out lists.h and types.h for inclusion to fix each of the
above respectively.
