macvtap: Close a race between macvtap_open and macvtap_dellink.

There is a small window in macvtap_open between looking up a
networking device and calling macvtap_set_queue in which
macvtap_del_queues called from macvtap_dellink.   After
calling macvtap_del_queues it is totally incorrect to
allow macvtap_set_queue to proceed so prevent success by
reporting that all of the available queues are in use.
