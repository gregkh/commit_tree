mm/huge_memory: fix copying user highpage

The THP copy-on-write handler falls back to regular-sized pages for a huge
page replacement upon allocation failure or if THP has been individually
disabled in the target VMA.  The loop responsible for copying page-sized
chunks accidentally uses multiples of PAGE_SHIFT instead of PAGE_SIZE as
the virtual address arg for copy_user_highpage().
