ASoC: simone: convert to use snd_soc_register_card()

Current method for machine driver to register with the ASoC core is to
use snd_soc_register_card() instead of creating a "soc-audio" platform device.

In addition we use platform_device_register_simple() to create a platform
device for the codec. This function will handle putting and deleting the
device automatically which simplifies the error handling in the machine
driver.
