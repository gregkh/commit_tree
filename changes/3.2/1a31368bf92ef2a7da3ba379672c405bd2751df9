mtd: add a flags for partitions which should just leave smth. after them

Add support for MTDPART_OFS_RETAIN: such partitions start at the current
offset, take as much space as possible, but rain part->size bytes after
the end of the partitions for other parts. Primarily this is intended
for ts72xx arm platforms cleanup.
