staging:iio:dac:ad5638: Fix channel address

Commit c6fc806247 ("staging:iio: ABI rework - add in_ or out_ prefix to
channnels") added the AD5868_CHANNEL macro to simplify channel initialization.
Unfortunately the macro hardcodes the channel's address to AD5686_ADDR_DAC0. As
a result writing to any of the channels will change the value of the first
channel.

This patch fixes the issue by calculating the channel address based on the
channel number.
