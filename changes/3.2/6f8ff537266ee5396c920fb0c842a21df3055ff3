ext4: handle NULL p_ext in ext4_ext_next_allocated_block()

In ext4_ext_next_allocated_block(), the path[depth] might
have a p_ext that is NULL -- see ext4_ext_binsearch().  In
such a case, dereferencing it will crash the machine.

This patch checks for p_ext == NULL in
ext4_ext_next_allocated_block() before dereferencinging it.

Tested using a hand-crafted an inode with eh_entries == 0 in
an extent block, verified that running FIEMAP on it crashes
without this patch, works fine with it.
