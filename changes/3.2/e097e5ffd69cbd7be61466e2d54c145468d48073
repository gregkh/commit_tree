KVM: Record instruction set in all vmexit tracepoints

The kvm_exit tracepoint recently added the isa argument to aid decoding
exit_reason.  The semantics of exit_reason depend on the instruction set
(vmx or svm) and the isa argument allows traces to be analyzed on other
machines.

Add the isa argument to kvm_nested_vmexit and kvm_nested_vmexit_inject
so these tracepoints can also be self-describing.
