ext4: split out ext4_free_blocks_after_init()

The function ext4_free_blocks_after_init() used to be a #define of
ext4_init_block_bitmap().  This actually made it difficult to
understand how the function worked, and made it hard make changes to
support clusters.  So as an initial cleanup, I've separated out the
functionality of initializing block bitmap from calculating the number
of free blocks in the new block group.
