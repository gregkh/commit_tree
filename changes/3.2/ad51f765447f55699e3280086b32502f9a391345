ASoC: Davinci: Fix FS polarity for I2S format

Commit 75d9ac4 ("ASoC: Allow DAI formats to be specified in the dai_link")
changed DAI format flag values and we cannot simply invert anymore e.g.
frame-sync with ^= SND_SOC_DAIFMT_NB_IF (which was anyway misuse) as there
is no anymore fixed bit position for bit-clock or frame-sync inversion.

Fix this by relying only on DAI format flag values passed to us and by not
making any assumption on individual bit positions
