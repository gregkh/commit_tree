[CPUFREQ] db8500: fix build error due to undeclared i variable

The variable i is removed by commit ded8433
"[CPUFREQ] db8500: remove unneeded for loop iteration over freq_table",
but current code to print available frequencies still uses the i variable.
Thus add the i variable back to fix below buld error:

  CC      drivers/cpufreq/db8500-cpufreq.o
drivers/cpufreq/db8500-cpufreq.c: In function 'db8500_cpufreq_init':
drivers/cpufreq/db8500-cpufreq.c:123: error: 'i' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/cpufreq/db8500-cpufreq.c:123: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/cpufreq/db8500-cpufreq.c:123: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [drivers/cpufreq/db8500-cpufreq.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/cpufreq] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2

This patch also fixes using uninitialized i variable as array index.
