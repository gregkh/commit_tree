ARM: S3C64XX: Use module identification for Cragganmore system builds

The Cragganmore system is modular with I2C based identification chips on
the system allowing identification of the system build. Provide a stub I2C
driver which parses the module IDs and uses them to select the appropriate
audio subsystem components to register. To avoid confusion due to having
the mini-driver in the system the driver is placed in a separate file.
