staging: zcache: fix possible sleep under lock

zcache_new_pool() calls kmalloc() with GFP_KERNEL which has
__GFP_WAIT set.  However, zcache_new_pool() gets called on
a stack that holds the swap_lock spinlock, leading to a
possible sleep-with-lock situation. The lock is obtained
in enable_swap_info().

The patch replaces GFP_KERNEL with GFP_ATOMIC.

v2: replace with GFP_ATOMIC, not GFP_IOFS
