KVM: Intelligent device lookup on I/O bus

Currently the method of dealing with an IO operation on a bus (PIO/MMIO)
is to call the read or write callback for each device registered
on the bus until we find a device which handles it.

Since the number of devices on a bus can be significant due to ioeventfds
and coalesced MMIO zones, this leads to a lot of overhead on each IO
operation.

Instead of registering devices, we now register ranges which points to
a device. Lookup is done using an efficient bsearch instead of a linear
search.

Performance test was conducted by comparing exit count per second with
200 ioeventfds created on one byte and the guest is trying to access a
different byte continuously (triggering usermode exits).
Before the patch the guest has achieved 259k exits per second, after the
patch the guest does 274k exits per second.
