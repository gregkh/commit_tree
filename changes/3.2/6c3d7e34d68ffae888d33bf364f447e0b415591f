ARM: OMAP3: HWMOD: fix DSS clock data

The OMAP3 HWMOD data currently contains these errors with DSS clocks:

- dss_rfbi is missing ick opt-clock, which is needed for RFBI to
  calculate timings

- dss_dsi is missing ick and sys_clk

- dss_venc is missing dss_96m_fck opt-clock, which is required on
  OMAP3430

- dss_venc's interface and main clocks are wrong, causing VENC to fail
  to start

These problems were temporarily fixed with a DSS patch
9ede365aa6f74428a1f69c21ca1cf21213167576 ("HACK: OMAP: DSS2: clk hack
for OMAP2/3"), which can be reverted after this patch (and the similar
patches for other OMAPs).
