tcp: add const qualifiers where possible

Adding const qualifiers to pointers can ease code review, and spot some
bugs. It might allow compiler to optimize code further.

For example, is it legal to temporary write a null cksum into tcphdr
in tcp_md5_hash_header() ? I am afraid a sniffer could catch the
temporary null value...
