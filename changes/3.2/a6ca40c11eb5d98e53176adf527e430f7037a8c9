Input: synaptics - decode AGM packet types

A Synaptics image sensor tracks 5 fingers, but can only report 2.

The algorithm for choosing which 2 fingers to report and in which packet:
  Touchpad maintains 5 slots, numbered 0 to 4
  Initially all slots are empty
  As new fingers are detected, assign them to the lowest available slots
  The touchpad always reports:
    SGM: lowest numbered non-empty slot
    AGM: highest numbered non-empty slot, if there is one

In addition, these touchpads have a special AGM packet type which reports
the number of fingers currently being tracked, and which finger is in
each of the two slots.  Unfortunately, these "TYPE=2" packets are only used
when more than 3 fingers are being tracked.  When less than 4 fingers
are present, the 'w' value must be used to track how many fingers are
present, and knowing which fingers are being reported is much more
difficult, if not impossible.
