ARM: 7062/1: cache: detect PIPT I-cache using CTR

The Cache Type Register L1Ip field identifies I-caches with a PIPT
policy using the encoding 11b.

This patch extends the cache policy parsing to identify PIPT I-caches
correctly and prevent them from being treated as VIPT aliasing in cases
where they are sufficiently large.
