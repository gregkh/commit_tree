rcu: Not necessary to pass rcu_read_lock_held() to rcu_dereference_protected()

Since ca5ecddf (rcu: define __rcu address space modifier for sparse)
rcu_dereference_check() use rcu_read_lock_held() as a part of condition
automatically.  Therefore, callers of rcu_dereference_check() no longer
need to pass rcu_read_lock_held() to rcu_dereference_check().
