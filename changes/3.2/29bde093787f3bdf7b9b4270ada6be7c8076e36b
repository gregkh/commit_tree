xen/blkback: Support 'feature-barrier' aka old-style BARRIER requests.

We emulate the barrier requests by draining the outstanding bio's
and then sending the WRITE_FLUSH command. To drain the I/Os
we use the refcnt that is used during disconnect to wait for all
the I/Os before disconnecting from the frontend. We latch on its
value and if it reaches either the threshold for disconnect or when
there are no more outstanding I/Os, then we have drained all I/Os.
