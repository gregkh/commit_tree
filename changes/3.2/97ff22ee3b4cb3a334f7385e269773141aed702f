USB: workaround for bug in old version of GCC

This patch (as1491) works around a bug in GCC-3.4.6, which is still
supposed to be supported.  The number of microseconds in the udelay()
call in quirk_usb_disable_ehci() is fixed at 100, but the compiler
doesn't understand this and generates a link-time error.  So we
replace the otherwise unused variable "delta" with a simple constant
100.  This same pattern is already used in other delay loops in that
source file.
