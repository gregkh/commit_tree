OMAPDSS: DISPC: Pass overlay params as arguments to dispc_ovl_setup()

dispc_ovl_enable_replication() and dispc_ovl_set_fifo_threshold() are currently
called in configure_overlay(). These are the only functions which cause DISPC
register writes of overlay parameters outside of dispc_ovl_setup().

Move these to dispc_ovl_setup() and pass replication, fifo_low and fifo_high
thresholds as arguments to dispc_ovl_setup() in order to be aligned with other
overlay parameters. No functional changes are made.
