ipv4: Fix inetpeer expire time information

As we update the learned pmtu informations on demand, we might
report a nagative expiration time value to userspace if the
pmtu informations are already expired and we have not send a
packet to that inetpeer after expiration. With this patch we
send a expire time of null to userspace after expiration
until the next packet is send to that inetpeer.
