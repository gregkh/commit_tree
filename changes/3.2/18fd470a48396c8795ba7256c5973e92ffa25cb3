PNPACPI: Simplify disabled resource registration

The attached patch simplifies 29df8d8f8702f0f53c1375015f09f04bc8d023c1.  As
the "pnp_xxx" structs are not designed to cope with IORESOURCE_DISABLED, and
hence no code can test for this value, setting this value is actually a "no op"
and can be skipped altogether.  It is sufficient to remove the checks for
"empty" resources and continue processing.

The patch is applied against 3.1.
