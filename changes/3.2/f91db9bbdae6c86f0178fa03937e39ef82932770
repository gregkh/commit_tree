ath6kl: Avoid finding bss presence in cfg80211 scan list

Connect event handler function is always reporting BSS info
to CFG80211 layer first and then followed by connect event is passed.

Before these steps, BSS presence is retrieved from CFG80211 layer,
but it is not used. Hence, removing that part.
