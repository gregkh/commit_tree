ore/exofs: Change ore_check_io API

Current ore_check_io API receives a residual
pointer, to report partial IO. But it is actually
not used, because in a multiple devices IO there
is never a linearity in the IO failure.

On the other hand if every failing device is reported
through a received callback measures can be taken to
handle only failed devices. One at a time.

This will also be needed by the objects-layout-driver
for it's error reporting facility.

Exofs is not currently using the new information and
keeps the old behaviour of failing the complete IO in
case of an error. (No partial completion)

TODO: Use an ore_check_io callback to set_page_error only
the failing pages. And re-dirty write pages.
