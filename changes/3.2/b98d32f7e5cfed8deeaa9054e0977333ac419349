[media] omap3isp: Move platform data definitions from isp.h to media/omap3isp.h

drivers/media/video/omap3isp/isp.h is not a proper location for a header
that needs to be included from board code. Move the platform data
definitions to media/omap3isp.h.

Board code still needs to include isp.h to get the struct isp_device
definition and access OMAP3 ISP platform callbacks. Those callbacks will
be replaced by more generic code.
