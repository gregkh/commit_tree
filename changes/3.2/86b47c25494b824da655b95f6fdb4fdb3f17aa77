perf: Do no try to schedule task events if there are none

perf_event_sched_in() shouldn't try to schedule task events if there
are none otherwise task's ctx->is_active will be set and will not be
cleared during sched_out. This will prevent newly added events from
being scheduled into the task context.

Fixes a boo-boo in commit 1d5f003f5a9 ("perf: Do not set task_ctx
pointer in cpuctx if there are no events in the context").
