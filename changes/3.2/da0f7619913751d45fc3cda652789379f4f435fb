target: merge transport_new_cmd_obj into transport_generic_new_cmd

These are two fairly small functions, and merging them gives a much
more readable control flow, and opportunities for more useful comments.

It also moves all code related to resources allocation closer together
and allows to remove a forward declaration for transport_allocate_tasks.
