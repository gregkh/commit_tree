ARM: S3C24XX: Remove hw_addr from s3c24xx dma channel declarations

According to commit c4806174c516d26bf4a72db1789cfc96e4950d07
(ARM: S3C2412: DMA: Remove I2S FIFO address) the S3C DMA API does not
make use of hw_addr.to/from declared for some of the channels in
mach-s3c24XX/dma.c

Grepping through the kernel also did non reveal any new users of
these properties since the mentioned commit.
