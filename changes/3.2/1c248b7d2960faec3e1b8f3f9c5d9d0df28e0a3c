DRM: add DRM Driver for Samsung SoC EXYNOS4210.

This patch is a DRM Driver for Samsung SoC Exynos4210 and now enables
only FIMD yet but we will add HDMI support also in the future.

this patch is based on git repository below:
git://people.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux.git
branch name: drm-next
commit-id: 88ef4e3f4f616462b78a7838eb3ffc3818d30f67

you can refer to our working repository below:
http://git.infradead.org/users/kmpark/linux-2.6-samsung
branch name: samsung-drm

We tried to re-use lowlevel codes of the FIMD driver(s3c-fb.c
based on Linux framebuffer) but couldn't so because lowlevel codes
of s3c-fb.c are included internally and so FIMD module of this driver has
its own lowlevel codes.

We used GEM framework for buffer management and DMA APIs(dma_alloc_*)
for buffer allocation so we can allocate physically continuous memory
for DMA through it and also we could use CMA later if CMA is applied to
mainline.

Refer to this link for CMA(Continuous Memory Allocator):
http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/20/45

this driver supports only physically continuous memory(non-iommu).

Changelog v2:
DRM: add DRM_IOCTL_SAMSUNG_GEM_MMAP ioctl command.

    this feature maps user address space to physical memory region
    once user application requests DRM_IOCTL_SAMSUNG_GEM_MMAP ioctl.

DRM: code clean and add exception codes.

Changelog v3:
DRM: Support multiple irq.

    FIMD and HDMI have their own irq handler but DRM Framework can regiter
    only one irq handler this patch supports mutiple irq for Samsung SoC.

DRM: Consider modularization.

    each DRM, FIMD could be built as a module.

DRM: Have indenpendent crtc object.

    crtc isn't specific to SoC Platform so this patch gets a crtc
    to be used as common object.
    created crtc could be attached to any encoder object.

DRM: code clean and add exception codes.

Changelog v4:
DRM: remove is_defult from samsung_fb.

    is_default isn't used for default framebuffer.

DRM: code refactoring to fimd module.
    this patch is be considered with multiple display objects and
    would use its own request_irq() to register a irq handler instead of
    drm framework's one.

DRM: remove find_samsung_drm_gem_object()

DRM: move kernel private data structures and definitions to driver folder.

    samsung_drm.h would contain only public information for userspace
    ioctl interface.

DRM: code refactoring to gem modules.
    buffer module isn't dependent of gem module anymore.

DRM: fixed security issue.

DRM: remove encoder porinter from specific connector.

    samsung connector doesn't need to have generic encoder.

DRM: code clean and add exception codes.

Changelog v5:
DRM: updated fimd(display controller) driver.
    added various pixel formats, color key and pixel blending features.

DRM: removed end_buf_off from samsung_drm_overlay structure.
    this variable isn't used and end buffer address would be
    calculated by each sub driver.

DRM: use generic function for mmap_offset.
    replaced samsung_drm_gem_create_mmap_offset() and
    samsung_drm_free_mmap_offset() with generic ones applied
    to mainline recentrly.

DRM: removed unnecessary codes and added exception codes.

DRM: added comments and code clean.

Changelog v6:
DRM: added default config options.

DRM: added padding for 64-bit align.

DRM: changed prefix 'samsung' to 'exynos'
