ASoC: twl6040: Chip initialization cleanup

There is no need to write to the vio registers at probe time, since most
them either read only, or shared with MFD or not used.
On the other hand it is a good idea to updated the ASICREV register in
the cache at this time.

After power up we need to restore some registers. Clean up the list to
contain only the registers we are going to restore.
