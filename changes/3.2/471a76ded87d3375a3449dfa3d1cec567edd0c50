ixgbevf: convert to ndo_fix_features

Private rx_csum flags are now duplicate of netdev->features & NETIF_F_RXCSUM.
Removing this needs deeper surgery.

Since ixgbevf doesn't change hardware state on RX csum enable/disable
its reset is avoided.

Things noticed:
 - HW VLAN acceleration probably can be toggled, but it's left as is
 - the resets on RX csum offload change can probably be avoided
 - there is A LOT of copy-and-pasted code here
