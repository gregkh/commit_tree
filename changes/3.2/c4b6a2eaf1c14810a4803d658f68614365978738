staging: hv: fix a kernel warning in netvsc_linkstatus_callback()

netif_notify_peers() caused a kernel warning in netvsc_linkstatus_callback(),
because netvsc_linkstatus_callback() is within IRQ context. So we move
the first call to netif_notify_peers() into queued work as well, but with
zero delay.

In addition to "staging-next", this should also be back-ported to stable
kernels 2.6.32 and later.
