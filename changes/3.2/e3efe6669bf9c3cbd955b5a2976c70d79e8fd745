regulator: remove duplicate REG_CTRL2 defines in tps65023

There are two sets of defines for the REG_CTRL2 bitfields and one
of them has TPS65023_REG_CTRL2_DCDC1 defined incorrectly. Remove
the duplicates and leave the correct one for TPS65023_REG_CTRL2_DCDC1.

This fixes the following sparse warnings:

drivers/regulator/tps65023-regulator.c:77:9: warning: preprocessor token TPS65023_REG_CTRL2_DCDC1 redefined
drivers/regulator/tps65023-regulator.c:70:9: this was the original definition
