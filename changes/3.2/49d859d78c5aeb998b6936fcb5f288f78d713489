x86, random: Verify RDRAND functionality and allow it to be disabled

If the CPU declares that RDRAND is available, go through a guranteed
reseed sequence, and make sure that it is actually working (producing
data.)   If it does not, disable the CPU feature flag.

Allow RDRAND to be disabled on the command line (as opposed to at
compile time) for a user who has special requirements with regards to
random numbers.
