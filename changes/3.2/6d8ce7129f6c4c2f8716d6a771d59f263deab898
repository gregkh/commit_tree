ARM: 7086/2: mach-integrator: modernize clock event registration

Drop mult, shift and delta calculations and let the
clockevent core scale this as appropriate.

Set the minimum interval to 1 rather than 15 (0xf), there
is nothing in the data sheets I have indicating that 15
should be some minimum value.
