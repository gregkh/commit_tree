Platform: Detect samsung laptop quirk when initial level is zero

This patch depends on the "Platform: Brightness quirk for samsung
laptop driver" patch from Jason Stubbs. This patch adds a check for an
initial brightness level of 0; if the level is 0, this patch changes
the brightness level to 1 before the driver attempts to detect the
brightness quirk.

The Samsung N150 netbook experiences the brightness quirk. Without
Jason's patch, the only brightness levels available on the N150 are 0,
1, and 8. This patch ensures that, when the initial brightness level
is 0, the samsang-laptop driver detects the brightness quirk on the
N150, thereby making brightness levels 0 through 8 available.
