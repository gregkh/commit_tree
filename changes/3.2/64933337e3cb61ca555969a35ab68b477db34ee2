[media] tvp5150: Add video format registers configuration values

The tvp5150 video decoder has two operation modes to configure the video
standard used.

If auto-switch mode is enable, the device can sense the signal and detect which
video standard the device is operating. Also the device can be forced to use a
user defined video standard.

Each operation mode uses a different register and the bitmask values to
represent each standard is different.

So we add video standard constants for both autoswitch and no-autoswitch mode.
