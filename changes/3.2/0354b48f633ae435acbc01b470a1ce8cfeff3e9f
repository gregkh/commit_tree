netfilter: xt_connbytes: handle negation correctly

"! --connbytes 23:42" should match if the packet/byte count is not in range.

As there is no explict "invert match" toggle in the match structure,
userspace swaps the from and to arguments
(i.e., as if "--connbytes 42:23" were given).

However, "what <= 23 && what >= 42" will always be false.

Change things so we use "||" in case "from" is larger than "to".

This change may look like it breaks backwards compatibility when "to" is 0.
However, older iptables binaries will refuse "connbytes 42:0",
and current releases treat it to mean "! --connbytes 0:42",
so we should be fine.
