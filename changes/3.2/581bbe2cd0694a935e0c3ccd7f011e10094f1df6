RDMA/cxgb4: Serialize calls to CQ's comp_handler

Commit 01e7da6ba53c ("RDMA/cxgb4: Make sure flush CQ entries are
collected on connection close") introduced a potential problem where a
CQ's comp_handler can get called simultaneously from different places
in the iw_cxgb4 driver.  This does not comply with
Documentation/infiniband/core_locking.txt, which states that at a
given point of time, there should be only one callback per CQ should
be active.

This problem was reported by Parav Pandit <Parav.Pandit@Emulex.Com>.
Based on discussion between Parav Pandit and Steve Wise, this patch
fixes the above problem by serializing the calls to a CQ's
comp_handler using a spin_lock.
