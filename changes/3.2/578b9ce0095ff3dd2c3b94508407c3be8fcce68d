tty: Add module.h to drivers/tty users who just expect it there.

We are cleaning up the issue that means module.h is omnipresent.
These tty users are the people who implictly are relying on that.
Fix up the real users to call out the include that they really need.

In the case of jsm_driver.c file, it had moduleparam.h but that
isn't enough and it needs the full module.h
