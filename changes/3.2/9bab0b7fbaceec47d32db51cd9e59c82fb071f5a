genirq: Add IRQF_RESUME_EARLY and resume such IRQs earlier

This adds a mechanism to resume selected IRQs during syscore_resume
instead of dpm_resume_noirq.

Under Xen we need to resume IRQs associated with IPIs early enough
that the resched IPI is unmasked and we can therefore schedule
ourselves out of the stop_machine where the suspend/resume takes
place.

This issue was introduced by 676dc3cf5bc3 "xen: Use IRQF_FORCE_RESUME".
