e1000e: WoL fails on device ID 0x1501

PCI device ID 0x1501 has a hardware bug when the link downshifts for
whatever reason which requires a workaround.  The workaround already exists
for other similar devices but is not called for 0x1501 (it should be called
for any ICH8-based device that uses a GbE PHY).  There is also one other
instance when the workaround should be called - after disabling gigabit
speed when going to Sx.
