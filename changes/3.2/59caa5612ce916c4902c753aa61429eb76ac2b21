sunhme: Allow usage on SBI based SBus systems

To prevent the SBus driver for Sun Happy Meal cards from being loaded for
PCI cards utilizing the same chipset, a filter was added to the probe
function in commit 0b492fce3d72d982a7981905f85484a1e1ba7fde.

The filter was implemented by checking the name of the parent node in
the OF tree. This patch extends this filter, so that the driver will
load on SBus systems that are based upon SBI SBus Bridges.
