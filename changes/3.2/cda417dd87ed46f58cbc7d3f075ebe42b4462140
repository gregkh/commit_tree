x86, ioapic: Factor out print_IO_APIC() to only print one io apic

It is getting too big after the interrupt remaping entries debug
print out was added.

Original print_IO_APIC() becomes print_IO_APICs().
New print_IO_APIC() will only print one ioapic's registers

As a side-effect this clean-up also made checkpatch.pl happier.
