ext4: fix fsx truncate failure

While running extended fsx tests to verify the first
two patches, a similar bug was also found in the
truncate operation.

This bug happens because the truncate routine only zeros
the unblock aligned portion of the last page.  This means
that the block aligned portions of the page appearing after
i_size are left unzeroed, and the buffer heads still mapped.

This bug is corrected by using ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers
in the truncate routine to zero the partial page and unmap
the buffer headers.
