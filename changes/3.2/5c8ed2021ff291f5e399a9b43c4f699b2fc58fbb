xfs: introduce xfs_bmapi_read()

xfs_bmapi() currently handles both extent map reading and
allocation. As a result, the code is littered with "if (wr)"
branches to conditionally do allocation operations if required.
This makes the code much harder to follow and causes significant
indent issues with the code.

Given that read mapping is much simpler than allocation, we can
split out read mapping from xfs_bmapi() and reuse the logic that
we have already factored out do do all the hard work of handling the
extent map manipulations. The results in a much simpler function for
the common extent read operations, and will allow the allocation
code to be simplified in another commit.

Once xfs_bmapi_read() is implemented, convert all the callers of
xfs_bmapi() that are only reading extents to use the new function.
