PM / Suspend: Fix bug in suspend statistics update

After commit 2a77c46de1e3dace73745015635ebbc648eca69c
(PM / Suspend: Add statistics debugfs file for suspend to RAM)
a missing pair of braces inside the state_store() function causes even
invalid arguments to suspend to be wrongly treated as failed suspend
attempts. Fix this.

[rjw: Put the hash/subject of the buggy commit into the changelog.]
