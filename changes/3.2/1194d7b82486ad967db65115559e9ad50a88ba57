ARM: OMAP3+: Update DPLL Fint range for OMAP36xx and OMAP4xxx devices

The OMAP36xx and OMAP4xxx DPLLs have a different internal reference
clock frequency (fint) operating range than OMAP3430. Update the
dpll_test_fint() function to check for the correct frequency ranges
for OMAP36xx and OMAP4xxx.

For OMAP36xx and OMAP4xxx devices, DPLLs fint range is 0.5MHz to
2.5MHz for j-type DPLLs and otherwise it is 32KHz to 52MHz for all
other DPLLs.
