locking, x86, iommu: Annotate qi->q_lock as raw

The qi->q_lock lock can be taken in atomic context and therefore
cannot be preempted on -rt - annotate it.

In mainline this change documents the low level nature of
the lock - otherwise there's no functional difference. Lockdep
and Sparse checking will work as usual.
