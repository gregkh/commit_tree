powerpc: Fix hugetlb with CONFIG_PPC_MM_SLICES=y

Commit 41151e77a4 ("powerpc: Hugetlb for BookE") added some
#ifdef CONFIG_MM_SLICES conditionals to hugetlb_get_unmapped_area()
and vma_mmu_pagesize().  Unfortunately this is not the correct config
symbol; it should be CONFIG_PPC_MM_SLICES.  The result is that
attempting to use hugetlbfs on 64-bit Power server processors results
in an infinite stack recursion between get_unmapped_area() and
hugetlb_get_unmapped_area().

This fixes it by changing the #ifdef to use CONFIG_PPC_MM_SLICES
in those functions and also in book3e_hugetlb_preload().
