slab, lockdep: Fix silly bug

Commit 30765b92 ("slab, lockdep: Annotate the locks before using
them") moves the init_lock_keys() call from after g_cpucache_up =
FULL, to before it. And overlooks the fact that init_node_lock_keys()
tests for it and ignores everything !FULL.

Introduce a LATE stage and change the lockdep test to be <LATE.
