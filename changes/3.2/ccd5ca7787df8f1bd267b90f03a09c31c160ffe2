OMAP2+: voltage: split voltage controller (VC) code into dedicated layer

As part of the voltage layer cleanup, split out VC specific code into
a dedicated VC layer.  This patch primarily just moves VC code from
voltage.c into vc.c, and adds prototypes to vc.h.

No functional changes.

For readability, each function was given a local 'vc' pointer:

    struct omap_vc_instance_data *vc = voltdm->vdd->vc_data;

and a global replace of s/vdd->vc_data/vc/ was done.

Also vc_init was renamed to vc_init_channel to reflect that this is
per-VC channel initializtion.
