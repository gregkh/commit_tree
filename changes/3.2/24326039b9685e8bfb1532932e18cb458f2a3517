Staging: hv: vmbus: Cleanup the code in process_chn_event()

A channel in Hyper-V is equivalent to a device. Thus, a channel is
persistent once it is presented to the guest, even if the driver
managing this device is unloaded. By checking and invoking the driver
specific callback function under the protection of the channel
inbound_lock, we can properly deal with racing driver unloads since an
unloading driver sets the callback to NULL under the protection of this
inbound_lock.
