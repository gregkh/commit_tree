target: Don't return an error status for 0-length READ and WRITE

IO commands with a TRANSFER LENGTH of 0 are not an error; for example,
for READ (10) and WRITE (10), SBC-3 says:

    A TRANSFER LENGTH field set to zero specifies that no logical blocks
    shall be read. This condition shall not be considered an error.

In case we have nothing to do, just complete the command with good status.
