Btrfs: honor extent thresh during defragmentation

We won't defrag an extent, if it's bigger than the threshold we
specified and there's no small extent before it, but actually
the code doesn't work this way.

There are three bugs:

- When should_defrag_range() decides we should keep on defragmenting
  an extent, last_len is not incremented. (old bug)

- The length that passes to should_defrag_range() is not the length
  we're going to defrag. (new bug)

- We always defrag 256K bytes data, and a big extent can be part of
  this range. (new bug)

For a file with 4 extents:

        | 4K | 4K | 256K | 256K |

The result of defrag with (the default) 256K extent thresh should be:

        | 264K | 256K |

but with those bugs, we'll get:

        | 520K |
