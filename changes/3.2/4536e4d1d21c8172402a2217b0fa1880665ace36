Revert "perf: Add PM notifiers to fix CPU hotplug races"

This reverts commit 144060fee07e9c22e179d00819c83c86fbcbf82c.

It causes a resume regression for Andi on his Acer Aspire 1830T post
3.1.  The screen just stays black after wakeup.

Also, it really looks like the wrong way to suspend and resume perf
events: I think they should be done as part of the CPU suspend and
resume, rather than as a notifier that does smp_call_function().
