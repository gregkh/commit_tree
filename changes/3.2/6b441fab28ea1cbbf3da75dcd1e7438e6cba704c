Bluetooth: bfusb: Fix error path on firmware load

When loading the usb-configuration we do not signal the end of configuration on
memory allocation error. This patch moves the memory allocation to the top so
every error path uses "goto error" now to correctly send the usb-ctrl message
when detecting some error.

This also replaces GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL as we are allowed to sleep here.
