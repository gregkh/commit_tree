xen/enlighten: Fix compile warnings and set cx to known value.

We get:
linux/arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c: In function ‘xen_start_kernel’:
linux/arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:226: warning: ‘cx’ may be used uninitialized in this function
linux/arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c:240: note: ‘cx’ was declared here

and the cx is really not set but passed in the xen_cpuid instruction
which masks the value with returned masked_ecx from cpuid. This
can potentially lead to invalid data being stored in cx.
