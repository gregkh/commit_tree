I2C: OMAP2+: address confused probed version naming

The driver reflects the confusion that probed I2C revision
from the hardware of 0x40 means it is on an OMAP4430.

However, you will probe the same 0x40 ID on an OMAP3530.  So
this patch changes the name to reflect that.

It also clarifies that the original name OMAP_I2C_REV_2 is
referring to some ancient OMAP1 revision number, not to be
confused with the IP revisions this patch series introduces.

Similarly the term "rev" is used in the ancient OMAP1 ISR,
the term is changed to use omap1 instead.
