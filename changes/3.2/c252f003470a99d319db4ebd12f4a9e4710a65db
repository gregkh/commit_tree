target: Prevent transport_send_task_abort when CHECK_CONDITION status

This patch fixes a bug where transport_send_task_abort() could be called
during LUN_RESET to return SAM_STAT_TASK_ABORTED + tfo->queue_status(), when
SCF_SENT_CHECK_CONDITION -> tfo->queue_status() has already been sent from
within another context via transport_send_check_condition_and_sense().
