btrfs: return EINVAL if start > total_bytes in fitrim ioctl

We should retirn EINVAL if the start is beyond the end of the file
system in the btrfs_ioctl_fitrim(). Fix that by adding the appropriate
check for it.

Also in the btrfs_trim_fs() it is possible that len+start might overflow
if big values are passed. Fix it by decrementing the len so that start+len
is equal to the file system size in the worst case.
