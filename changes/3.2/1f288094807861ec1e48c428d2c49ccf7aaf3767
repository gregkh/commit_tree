rcu: Use kthread_create_on_node()

Commit a26ac2455ffc (move TREE_RCU from softirq to kthread) added
per-CPU kthreads.  However, kthread creation uses kthread_create(), which
can put the kthread's stack and task struct on the wrong NUMA node.
Therefore, use kthread_create_on_node() instead of kthread_create()
so that the stacks and task structs are placed on the correct NUMA node.

A similar change was carried out in commit 94dcf29a11b3 (kthread:
use kthread_create_on_node()).

Also change rcutorture's priority-boost-test kthread creation.
