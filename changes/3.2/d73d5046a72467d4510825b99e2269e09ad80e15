ext4: Use correct locking for ext4_end_io_nolock()

We must hold i_completed_io_lock when manipulating anything on the
i_completed_io_list linked list.  This includes io->lock, which we
were checking in ext4_end_io_nolock().

So move this check to ext4_end_io_work().  This also has the bonus of
avoiding extra work if it is already done without needing to take the
mutex.
