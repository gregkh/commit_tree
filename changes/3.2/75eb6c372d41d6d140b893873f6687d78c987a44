block: pass around REQ_* flags instead of broken down booleans during request alloc/free

blk_alloc_request() and freed_request() take different combinations of
REQ_* @flags, @priv and @is_sync when @flags is superset of the latter
two.  Make them take @flags only.  This cleans up the code a bit and
will ease updating allocation related REQ_* flags.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional difference.
