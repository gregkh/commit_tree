ARM: 7061/1: gic: convert logical CPU numbers into physical numbers

The GIC driver must convert logical CPU numbers passed in from Linux
into physical CPU numbers that are understood by the hardware.

This patch uses the new cpu_logical_map macro for performing the
conversion inside the GIC driver.
