drm/i915/dp: Dither down to 6bpc if it makes the mode fit

Some active adaptors (VGA usually) only have two lanes at 2.7GHz.
That's a maximum pixel clock of 144MHz at 8bpc, but 192MHz at 6bpc.

Fixes Asus UX31 panel being black at startup due to no valid modes since
dc22ee6fc18ce0f15424e753e8473c306ece95c1.

v2: Rebased to current code, resulting in the fix applying to EDP panels as
    well.  Also changed from spatio-temporal to just spatial dithering on
    pre-ironlake, to be conssitent (and less visual flicker)
