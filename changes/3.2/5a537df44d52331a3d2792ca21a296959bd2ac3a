md/bitmap: rename and tidy up BITMAP_PAGE_CLEAN

The flag 'BITMAP_PAGE_CLEAN' has a confusing name as it doesn't mean
that the page is clean, but rather that there are counters in the page
which allow bits in the bitmap to be cleared - i.e. maybe cleaning can
happen.

So change it to BITMAP_PAGE_PENDING and fix some irregularities:
 - Don't set it in bitmap_init_from_disk as bitmap_set_memory_bits
   sets it when needed
 - in bitmap_daemon_work, if we find a counter that is '1', but
   need_sync is set, then set BITMAP_PAGE_PENDING again (it was
   recently cleared) to ensure we don't forget about this bit.
