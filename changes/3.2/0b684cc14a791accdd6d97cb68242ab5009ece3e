ASoC: Initial WM8996 headphone impedance measurement support

The WM8996 can measure the impedance of accessories connected to the
headphone output. Implement initial support for this, measuring the
left channel impedance when an accessory is detected and using this
to distinguish between a line load and a headphone load.
