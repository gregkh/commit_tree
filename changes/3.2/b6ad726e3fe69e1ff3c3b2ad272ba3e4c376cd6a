mmc: core: Prevent too long response times for suspend

While trying to suspend the mmc host there could still be
ongoing requests that we need to wait for. At the same time
a device driver must respond to a suspend request rather quickly.

Instead of potentially wait "forever" by claiming the host we now
"try" to claim the host instead. If it fails, -EBUSY is returned.
