mm/huge_memory: fix typo when updating mmu cache

There are three cases of update_mmu_cache() in the file, and the case in
function collapse_huge_page() has a typo, namely the last parameter used,
which is corrected based on the other two cases.

Due to the define of update_mmu_cache by X86, the only arch that
implements THP currently, the change here has no really crystal point, but
one or two minutes of efforts could be saved for those archs that are
likely to support THP in future.
