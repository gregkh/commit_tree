slub: use irqsafe_cpu_cmpxchg for put_cpu_partial

The cmpxchg must be irq safe. The fallback for this_cpu_cmpxchg only
disables preemption which results in per cpu partial page operation
potentially failing on non x86 platforms.

This patch fixes the following problem reported by Christian Kujau:

  I seem to hit it with heavy disk & cpu IO is in progress on this
  PowerBook
  G4. Full dmesg & .config: http://nerdbynature.de/bits/3.2.0-rc1/oops/

  I've enabled some debug options and now it really points to slub.c:2166

  With debug options enabled I'm currently in the xmon debugger, not sure
  what to make of it yet, I'll try to get something useful out of it :)
