ARM: OMAP2+: clock data: Remove redundant timer clkdev

The commit 318c3e15cd55c73a26ae22a65a8183655b3003f9
added some "fck" clock alias to timer devices that are
not needed anymore since hwmod framework will create
them automatically.

A warning was added to highlight and thus fix the redundancy.

Remove all the clkdev entries for timer fck alias.
