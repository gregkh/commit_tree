igb: drop support for single buffer mode

This change removes support for single buffer mode from igb and makes the
driver function in packet split always.  The advantage to doing this is
that we can reduce total memory allocation overhead significantly as we
will only need to allocate one 1K slab per packet and then make use of a
reusable half page instead of allocating a 2K slab per packet.
