md/raid5: abort any pending parity operations when array fails.

When the number of failed devices exceeds the allowed number
we must abort any active parity operations (checks or updates) as they
are no longer meaningful, and can lead to a BUG_ON in
handle_parity_checks6.

This bug was introduce by commit 6c0069c0ae9659e3a91b68eaed06a5c6c37f45c8
in 2.6.29.
