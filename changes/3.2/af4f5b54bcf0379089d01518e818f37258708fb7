pnfs-obj: move to ore 01: ore_layout & ore_components

For Ease of reviewing I split the move to ore into 3 parts
	move to ore 01: ore_layout & ore_components
	move to ore 02: move to ORE
	move to ore 03: Remove old raid engine

This patch modifies the objio_lseg, layout-segment level
and devices and components arrays to use the ORE types.

Though it will be removed soon, also the raid engine
is modified to actually compile, possibly run, with
the new types. So it is the same old raid engine but
with some new ORE types.

For Ease of reviewing, some of the old code is
"#if 0" but is not removed so the diff command works
better. The old code will be removed in the 3rd patch.
