ARM: 7181/1: Restrict kprobes probing SWP instructions to ARMv5 and below

The SWP instruction is deprecated on ARMv6 and with ARMv7 it will be
UNDEFINED when CONFIG_SWP_EMULATE is selected. In this case, probing a
SWP instruction will cause an oops when the kprobes emulation code
executes an undefined instruction.

As the SWP instruction should be rare or non-existent in kernels for
ARMv6 and later, we can simply avoid these problems by not allowing
probing of these.
