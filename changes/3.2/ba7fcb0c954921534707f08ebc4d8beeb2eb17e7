[media] media: vb2: dma contig allocator: use dma_addr instread of paddr

Use the correct 'dma_addr' name for the buffer address. 'paddr' suggested
that this is the physical address in system memory. For most ARM platforms
these two are the same, but this is not a generic rule. 'dma_addr' will
also point better to dma-mapping api.
