oprofile, arm/sh: Fix oprofile_arch_exit() linkage issue

This change fixes a linking problem, which happens if oprofile
is selected to be compiled as built-in:

  `oprofile_arch_exit' referenced in section `.init.text' of
  arch/arm/oprofile/built-in.o: defined in discarded section
  `.exit.text' of arch/arm/oprofile/built-in.o

The problem is appeared after commit 87121ca504, which
introduced oprofile_arch_exit() calls from __init function. Note
that the aforementioned commit has been backported to stable
branches, and the problem is known to be reproduced at least
with 3.0.13 and 3.1.5 kernels.
