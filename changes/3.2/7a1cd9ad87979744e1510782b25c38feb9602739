dma: shdma: transfer based runtime PM

Currently the shdma dmaengine driver uses runtime PM to save power, when
no channel on the specific controller is requested by a user. This patch
switches the driver to count individual DMA transfers. That way the
controller can be powered down between transfers, even if some of its
channels are in use.
