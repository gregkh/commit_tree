KVM: PPC: Add PAPR hypercall code for PR mode

When running a PAPR guest, we need to handle a few hypercalls in kernel space,
most prominently the page table invalidation (to sync the shadows).

So this patch adds handling for a few PAPR hypercalls to PR mode KVM. I tried
to share the code with HV mode, but it ended up being a lot easier this way
around, as the two differ too much in those details.
