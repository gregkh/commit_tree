PM QoS: Generalize and export constraints management code

In preparation for the per-device constratins support:
 - rename update_target to pm_qos_update_target
 - generalize and export pm_qos_update_target for usage by the upcoming
   per-device latency constraints framework:
   * operate on struct pm_qos_constraints for constraints management,
   * introduce an 'action' parameter for constraints add/update/remove,
   * the return value indicates if the aggregated constraint value has
     changed,
 - update the internal code to operate on struct pm_qos_constraints
 - add a NULL pointer check in the API functions
