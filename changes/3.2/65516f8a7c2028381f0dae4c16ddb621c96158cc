clockevents: Add direct ktime programming function

There is at least one architecture (s390) with a sane clockevent device
that can be programmed with the equivalent of a ktime. No need to create
a delta against the current time, the ktime can be used directly.

A new clock device function 'set_next_ktime' is introduced that is called
with the unmodified ktime for the timer if the clock event device has the 
CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_KTIME bit set.
