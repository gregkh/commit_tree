[media] noon010pc30: Improve s_power operation handling

Remove the now unneeded check for the platform data in s_power
handler and the platform data pointer in struct noon010_info.
Also do not reset the configured output resolution and pixel
format when cycling sensor's power.
Add small delay for proper reset signal shape.
