watchdog: move watchdog_*_all_cpus under CONFIG_SYSCTL

Fix compilation warnings for CONFIG_SYSCTL=n:

fixed compilation warnings in case of disabled CONFIG_SYSCTL
kernel/watchdog.c:483:13: warning: `watchdog_enable_all_cpus' defined but not used
kernel/watchdog.c:500:13: warning: `watchdog_disable_all_cpus' defined but not used

these functions are static and are used only in sysctl handler, so move
them inside #ifdef CONFIG_SYSCTL too
