[S390] Force PSW restart on online CPU

PSW restart can be triggered on offline CPUs. If this happens, currently
the PSW restart code fails, because functions like smp_processor_id()
do not work on offline CPUs. This patch fixes this as follows:

If PSW restart is triggered on an offline CPU, the PSW restart (sigp restart)
is done a second time on another CPU that is online and the old CPU is
stopped afterwards.
