sound: oss: use strlcpy() in sound_timer_init()

sound_timer.info.name is a 32 character buffer.  This function only
has one caller (in sound/oss/ad1848.c) and it passes as 128 character
buffer as "name".  I don't know if this is a problem in real life,
and I doubt we're going to add more OSS drivers so it's unlikely to
become an issue.  But we may as well take care of it.
