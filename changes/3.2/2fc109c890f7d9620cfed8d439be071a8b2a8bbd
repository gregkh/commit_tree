IB/qib: Optimize RC/UC code by IB operation

The memset for zeroing work completions had been unconditional.

This patch removes the memset and moves the zeroing into the work
completion with a more explicit field by field set.  With this patch,
non-ONLY/non-LAST packets will avoid the overhead since they will not
generate a completion.
