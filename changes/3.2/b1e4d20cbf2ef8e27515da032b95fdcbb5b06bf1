params: make dashes and underscores in parameter names truly equal

The user may use "foo-bar" for a kernel parameter defined as "foo_bar".
Make sure it works the other way around too.

Apply the equality of dashes and underscores on early_params and __setup
params as well.

The example given in Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt indicates that
this is the intended behaviour.

With the patch the kernel accepts "log-buf-len=1M" as expected.
