genirq: percpu: allow interrupt type to be set at enable time

As request_percpu_irq() doesn't allow for a percpu interrupt to have
its type configured (it is generally impossible to configure it on all
CPUs at once), add a 'type' argument to enable_percpu_irq().

This allows some low-level, board specific init code to be switched to
a generic API.

[ tglx: Added WARN_ON argument ]
