ARM: OMAP2+: Fix missing inline functions for Makefile cleanup

Commit f41caddbe73f52a42f529d668ce47b4d693fd2c0 (omap2+: Use
Kconfig symbol in Makefile instead of obj-y) cleaned up the
omap2+ Makefile. However this did not account for the inline
functions that are now needed for board_flash_init and
board_nand_init.
