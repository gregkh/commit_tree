x86, AMD: Correct align_va_addr documentation

Commit dfb09f9b7ab0 ("x86, amd: Avoid cache aliasing penalties
on AMD family 15h") introduced a kernel command line parameter
called 'align_va_addr' which still refers to arguments used in
an earlier version of the patch and which got changed without
updating the documentation. Correct that omission.
