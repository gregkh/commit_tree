Input: adp5589-keys - add support for the ADP5585 derivatives

The ADP5585 family keypad decoder and IO expander is similar to the ADP5589,
however it features less IO pins, and lacks hardware assisted key-lock
functionality. Unfortunately the register addresses are different, as well as
the event codes and bit organization within the port related registers.

Move ADP5589 Register defines from the header file into the main source file.
Add new defines while making sure we don't break existing platform_data.
Add register address translation, and turn device specific defines into variables.
Introduce some helper functions and disable functions that doesn't
exist on the added devices.
