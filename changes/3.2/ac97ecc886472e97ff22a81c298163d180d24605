gspca: Fix falling back to lower isoc alt settings

The current gspca core code has a regression where it no longer properly
falls back to lower alt settings when there is not enough bandwidth.

This causes many iso based usb-1 cameras to not work when plugged into a
usb2 hub or a sandybridge chipset motherboard!

This patch fixes this.
