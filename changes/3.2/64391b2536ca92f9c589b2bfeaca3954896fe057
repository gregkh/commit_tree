xen/blkback: Fix the inhibition to map pages when discarding sector ranges.

The 'operation' parameters are the ones provided to the bio layer while
the req->operation are the ones passed in between the backend and
frontend. We used the wrong 'operation' value to squash the
call to map pages when processing the discard operation resulting
in an hypercall that did nothing. Lets guard against going in the
mapping function by checking for the proper operation type.
