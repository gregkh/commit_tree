[S390] kdump: Add size to elfcorehdr kernel parameter

Currently only the address of the pre-allocated ELF header is passed with
the elfcorehdr= kernel parameter. In order to reserve memory for the header
in the 2nd kernel also the size is required. Current kdump architecture
backends use different methods to do that, e.g. x86 uses the memmap= kernel
parameter. On s390 there is no easy way to transfer this information.
Therefore the elfcorehdr kernel parameter is extended to also pass the size.
This now can also be used as standard mechanism by all future kdump
architecture backends.

The syntax of the kernel parameter is extended as follows:

elfcorehdr=[size[KMG]@]offset[KMG]

This change is backward compatible because elfcorehdr=size is still allowed.
