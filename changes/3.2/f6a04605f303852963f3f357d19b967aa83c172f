HID: support primax keyboards violating USB HID spec

Primax keyboards with the issue this driver addresses report modifier
keys as in band key events instead of as out of band modifier bits,
resulting in the modifier keys generating key up events immediately
before the keys they are intended to modify.  This driver rewrites
the raw report data from such keyboards into USB HID 1.11 compliant
report data.  It only matches the USB vendor and product IDs for the
keyboard it has been tested on. Since there are several keyboards,
notably a number of laptops and folding USB keyboards known to have
similar unresolved problem reports, the list is expected to grow.
