rps: Inspect GRE encapsulated packets to get flow hash

Crack open GRE packets in __skb_get_rxhash to compute 4-tuple hash on
in encapsulated packet.  Note that this is used only when the
__skb_get_rxhash is taken, in particular only when the device does
not compute provide the rxhash (ie. feature is disabled).

This was tested by creating a single GRE tunnel between two 16 core
AMD machines.  200 netperf TCP_RR streams were ran with 1 byte
request and response size.
