trace: Add ring buffer stats to measure rate of events

The stats file under per_cpu folder provides the number of entries,
overruns and other statistics about the CPU ring buffer. However, the
numbers do not provide any indication of how full the ring buffer is in
bytes compared to the overall size in bytes. Also, it is helpful to know
the rate at which the cpu buffer is filling up.

This patch adds an entry "bytes: " in printed stats for per_cpu ring
buffer which provides the actual bytes consumed in the ring buffer. This
field includes the number of bytes used by recorded events and the
padding bytes added when moving the tail pointer to next page.

It also adds the following time stamps:
"oldest event ts:" - the oldest timestamp in the ring buffer
"now ts:"  - the timestamp at the time of reading

The field "now ts" provides a consistent time snapshot to the userspace
when being read. This is read from the same trace clock used by tracing
event timestamps.

Together, these values provide the rate at which the buffer is filling
up, from the formula:
bytes / (now_ts - oldest_event_ts)
