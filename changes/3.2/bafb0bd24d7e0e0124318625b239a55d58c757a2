TTY: serial, move locking in uart_close

So now, when we handle CLOSING flag, there is no point to hold
port->mutex over the start of uart_close.

Yes, there are still several things to reason about:
* port->count etc is and always was protected by a spinlock
* ->stop_rx is protected by a spinlock. Otherwise it would
  race with interrupts.
* uart_wait_until_sent -- that one is already called without
  port->mutex from set_termios and tty_set_ldisc. Should anything
  be protected there, it would be tx_empty. And by a spinlock.
  8250 does this internally...

This step is needed to fix system stalls. To not create an AB-BA lock
dependency (see next patches).
