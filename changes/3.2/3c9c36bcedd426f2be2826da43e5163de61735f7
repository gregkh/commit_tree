net: Define NETDEV_FCOE_WWNN, NETDEV_FCOE_WWPN only when CONFIG_LIBFCOE is enabled

bnx2fc driver calls netdev->netdev_ops->ndo_fcoe_get_wwn() and it may not
be defined with the current Kconfig dependencies.  ndo_fcoe_get_wwn is
dependent on CONFIG_FCOE, but bnx2fc does not select CONFIG_FCOE, as it does
not depend on fcoe driver. Since both fcoe and bnx2fc drivers select
CONFIG_LIBFCOE, define NETDEV_FCOE_WWNN and NETDEV_FCOE_WWPN when
CONFIG_LIBFCOE is defined.
