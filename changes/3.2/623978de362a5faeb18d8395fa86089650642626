mtd: nand: scrub BBT on ECC errors

Now that `read_bbt()' returns ECC error codes properly, we handle those
codes when checking the integrity of our flash-based BBT.

The modifications can be described by this new policy:

*) On any uncorrected ECC error, we invalidate the corresponding table
   and retry our version-checking integrity logic.
*) On corrected bitflips, we mark both tables for re-writing to flash
   (a.k.a. scrubbing).

Current integrity checks (i.e., comparing version numbers, etc.) should
take care of all the cases that result in rescanning the device for bad
blocks or falling back to the BBT as found in the mirror descriptor.
