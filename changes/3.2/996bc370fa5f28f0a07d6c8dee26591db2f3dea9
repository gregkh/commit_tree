b43: Relax requirement for descriptors to be in the DMA zone

When 64-bit DMA was first used, there were problems with the
BCM4311 (14e4:4311). The problem was "fixed" by using the GFP_DMA
flag in the allocation of coherent ring descriptor memory.

The original problem is now believed to have been due to bugs in
the 64-bit DMA implementation in the rest of the kernel, and that
those bugs have been fixed. Accordingly, the requirement for the
descriptors to be in the DMA zone is relaxed.

Bounce buffers are left in the DMA zone.
