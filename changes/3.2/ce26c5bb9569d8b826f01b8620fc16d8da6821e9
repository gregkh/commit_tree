PM / devfreq: Add basic governors

Four cpufreq-like governors are provided as examples.

powersave: use the lowest frequency possible. The user (device) should
set the polling_ms as 0 because polling is useless for this governor.

performance: use the highest freqeuncy possible. The user (device)
should set the polling_ms as 0 because polling is useless for this
governor.

userspace: use the user specified frequency stored at
devfreq.user_set_freq. With sysfs support in the following patch, a user
may set the value with the sysfs interface.

simple_ondemand: simplified version of cpufreq's ondemand governor.

When a user updates OPP entries (enable/disable/add), OPP framework
automatically notifies devfreq to update operating frequency
accordingly. Thus, devfreq users (device drivers) do not need to update
devfreq manually with OPP entry updates or set polling_ms for powersave
, performance, userspace, or any other "static" governors.

Note that these are given only as basic examples for governors and any
devices with devfreq may implement their own governors with the drivers
and use them.
