slub: move discard_slab out of node lock

Lockdep reports there is potential deadlock for slub node list_lock.
discard_slab() is called with the lock hold in unfreeze_partials(),
which could trigger a slab allocation, which could hold the lock again.

discard_slab() doesn't need hold the lock actually, if the slab is
already removed from partial list.
