x86: cache_info: Kill the atomic allocation in amd_init_l3_cache()

It's not a good reason to allocate memory in the smp function call
just because someone thought it's the most conveniant place.

The AMD L3 data is coupled to the northbridge info by a pointer to the
corresponding north bridge data. So allocating it with the northbridge
data and referencing the northbridge in the cache_info code instead
uses less memory and gets rid of that atomic allocation hack in the
smp function call.
