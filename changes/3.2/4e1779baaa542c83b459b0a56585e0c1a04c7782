PM QoS: Reorganize data structs

In preparation for the per-device constratins support, re-organize
the data strctures:
 - add a struct pm_qos_constraints which contains the constraints
 related data
 - update struct pm_qos_object contents to the PM QoS internal object
 data. Add a pointer to struct pm_qos_constraints
 - update the internal code to use the new data structs.
