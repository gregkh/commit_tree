usb: dwc3: ep0: Make USB30CV happy with SetAddress

According to USB 3.0 Specification, a SetAddress()
while device is in Configured State has an unspecified
behavior (see Section 9.4.6). Still USB30CV wasn't
happy with my Stall reply.

To make that thing happy, just accept the SetAddress()
always. No problems have been observed thus far.
