tracing/filter: Add startup tests for events filter

Adding automated tests running as late_initcall. Tests are
compiled in with CONFIG_FTRACE_STARTUP_TEST option.

Adding test event "ftrace_test_filter" used to simulate
filter processing during event occurance.

String filters are compiled and tested against several
test events with different values.

Also testing that evaluation of explicit predicates is ommited
due to the lazy filter evaluation.
