staging: rtl8712: remove r8712_cmd_thread()->daemonize()

daemonize() is only needed when a user-space task does kernel_thread().

r8712_cmd_thread() is kthread_create()'ed and thus it doesn't need
the soon-to-be-deprecated daemonize(). It is the only caller of
thread_enter() which actually does the call.

Note:
	- we are going to remove the sigdelset(blocked) code from
	  allow_signal(), this means that without this patch
	  thread_enter() can't work after that. Not to mention
	  daemonize() should be deprecated.

	- as a side effect, this patch changes ->comm. Hopefully
	  this is fine, and padapter->pnetdev->name probably makes
	  more sense anyway.
