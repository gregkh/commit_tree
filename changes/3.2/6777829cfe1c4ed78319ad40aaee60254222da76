pci: Add flag indicating device has been assigned by KVM

Device drivers that create and destroy SR-IOV virtual functions via
calls to pci_enable_sriov() and pci_disable_sriov can cause catastrophic
failures if they attempt to destroy VFs while they are assigned to
guest virtual machines.  By adding a flag for use by the KVM module
to indicate that a device is assigned a device driver can check that
flag and avoid destroying VFs while they are assigned and avoid system
failures.
