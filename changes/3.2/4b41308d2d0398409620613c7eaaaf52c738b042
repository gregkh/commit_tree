alarmtimers: Change alarmtimer functions to return alarmtimer_restart values

In order to properly fix the denial of service issue with high freq
periodic alarm timers, we need to push the re-arming logic into the
alarm timer handler, much as the hrtimer code does.

This patch introduces alarmtimer_restart enum and changes the
alarmtimer handler declarations to use it as a return value. Further,
to ease following changes, it extends the alarmtimer handler functions
to also take the time at expiration. No logic is yet modified.
