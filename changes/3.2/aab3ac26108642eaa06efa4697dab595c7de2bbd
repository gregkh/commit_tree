skfp: Fix SysKonnect FDDI driver compile issues

After moving the skfp driver, issues with the #include pathing to
their locel headers was somehow exposed.  Several headers had the
incorrect path, so they were not able to be found during compile
time.

This patch fixes up the path issues to the local headers that need
to be included.
