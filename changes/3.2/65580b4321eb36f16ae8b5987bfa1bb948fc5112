xHCI: set USB2 hardware LPM

If the device pass the USB2 software LPM and the host supports hardware
LPM, enable hardware LPM for the device to let the host decide when to
put the link into lower power state.

If hardware LPM is enabled for a port and driver wants to put it into
suspend, it must first disable hardware LPM, resume the port into U0,
and then suspend the port.
