MAINTAINERS: add ASLR maintainer

Since achieving the full ASLR by merging the PIE randomization in commit
cc503c1b43 ("x86: PIE executable randomization"), I have been dealing with
most (if not all) of the bugreports reported against userspace address
space randomization, so it might be a good idea to provide a decent
contact point in MAINTAINERS.
