staging: r8712u: Sets to SSID, and to AP MAC#, can now be done when the interface is Down.

The original Realtek code assumed that ioctl Sets get done after the
interface is Up. This included the set to Essid and to the AP MAC#;
and it fit Realtek's installation procedure. But there is no such
necessity for the adapter, and no stated requirement found
elsewhere. Also, wireless drivers typically permit this.

A typical error message used to be:
Error for wireless request "Set ESSID" (8B1A) :
    SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not permitted.
