i2c-eg20t: correct the driver init order of pch_i2c_probe()

Before registering an adapter to i2c subsystem, we need make sure
driver is ready for incoming i2c xfer, becasue the i2c_add_adapter()
may trigger a i2c device driver's proble function which may start
some real i2c xfer. I met this issue when integrating a TSC2007 i2c
touch screen device with the i2c-eg20t driver.

This patch will call request_irq() and hw init before calling
i2c_add_adapter().
