sysfs: add unsigned long cast to prevent compile warning

"sysfs: use rb-tree for inode number lookup" added a new printk which
causes a new compile warning on s390 (and few other architectures):

fs/sysfs/dir.c: In function 'sysfs_link_sibling':
fs/sysfs/dir.c:63:4: warning: format '%lx' expects argument of type
  'long unsigned int', but argument 2 has type 'ino_t' [-Wform

Add an explicit unsigned long cast since ino_t is an unsigned long on
most architectures.
