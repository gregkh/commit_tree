wl12xx: update acx commands

Update the acx commands according to the new fw api
(fw >= 6/7.3.0.0.75).

The main change in most of the ACXs is the addition
of a new role_id/link_id field, which is required
for multi-role operation.

Currently, we don't really support multi-role, as
most of our data (inside wl) is global.
As the current fw doesn't support concurrent roles
yet, keep it this way and add wl->role_id and
wl->sta_hlid to save the active role/link.
