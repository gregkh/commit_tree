rcu: Add RCU type to callback-invocation tracing

Add a string to the rcu_batch_start() and rcu_batch_end() trace
messages that indicates the RCU type ("rcu_sched", "rcu_bh", or
"rcu_preempt").  The trace messages for the actual invocations
themselves are not marked, as it should be clear from the
rcu_batch_start() and rcu_batch_end() events before and after.
