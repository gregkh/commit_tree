powerpc/eeh: Fix /proc/ppc64/eeh creation

Since commit 188917e183cf9ad0374b571006d0fc6d48a7f447, /proc/ppc64 is a
symlink to /proc/powerpc/. That means that creating /proc/ppc64/eeh will
end up with a unaccessible file, that is not listed under /proc/powerpc/
and, then, not listed under /proc/ppc64/.

Creating /proc/powerpc/eeh fixes that problem and maintain the
compatibility intended with the ppc64 symlink.
