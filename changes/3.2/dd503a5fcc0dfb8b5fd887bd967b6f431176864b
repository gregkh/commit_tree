target: Have core_tmr_alloc_req() take an explicit GFP_xxx flag

Testing in_interrupt() to know when sleeping is allowed is not really
reliable (since eg it won't be true if the caller is holding a spinlock).
Instead have the caller tell core_tmr_alloc_req() what GFP_xxx to use;
every caller except tcm_qla2xxx can use GFP_KERNEL.
