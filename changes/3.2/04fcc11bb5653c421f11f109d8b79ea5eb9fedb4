KVM: PPC: Interpret SDR1 as HVA in PAPR mode

When running a PAPR guest, the guest is not allowed to set SDR1 - instead
the HTAB information is held in internal hypervisor structures. But all of
our current code relies on SDR1 and walking the HTAB like on real hardware.

So in order to not be too intrusive, we simply set SDR1 to the HTAB we hold
in host memory. That way we can keep the HTAB in user space, but use it from
kernel space to map the guest.
