[media] [1/2,ver,1.89] DM04/QQBOX Interupt Urb and Timing changes

Reduce buffer size of Interupt urb to 128 bytes and polling
interval to 8.

The devices buffer appears to only handle a maxium of 40 bytes.
If the buffer is full a slowing effect is noticed causing occasionnal
dropped streaming packets.
