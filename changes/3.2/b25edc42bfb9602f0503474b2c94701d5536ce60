cpuidle: Remove CPUIDLE_FLAG_IGNORE and dev->prepare()

The cpuidle_device->prepare() mechanism causes updates to the
cpuidle_state[].flags, setting and clearing CPUIDLE_FLAG_IGNORE
to tell the governor not to chose a state on a per-cpu basis at
run-time. State demotion is now handled by the driver and it returns
the actual state entered. Hence, this mechanism is not required.
Also this removes per-cpu flags from cpuidle_state enabling
it to be made global.
