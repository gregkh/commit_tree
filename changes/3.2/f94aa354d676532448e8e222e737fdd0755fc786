iio: impedance-analyzer: New driver for AD5933/4 Impedance Converter, Network Analyzer

The AD5933 is a high precision impedance converter system solution
that combines an on-board frequency generator with a 12-bit, 1 MSPS,
analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The frequency generator allows an
external complex impedance to be excited with a known frequency.

The response signal from the impedance is sampled by the on-board ADC
and a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is processed by an on-chip DSP engine.
The DFT algorithm returns a real (R) and imaginary (I) data-word at each
output frequency.

Changes since V1:

Apply list review feedback:
Consistently use poll_time_jiffies.
Use be|le cpu endian helpers where applicable.
Add various comments.

Changes since V2:

Fix KernelVersion tag in Documentation.
Declare ad5933_default_pdata static.
Fix typos.
