arm: convert core files from module.h to export.h

Many of the core ARM kernel files are not modules, but just
including module.h for exporting symbols.  Now these files can
use the lighter footprint export.h for this role.

There are probably lots more, but ARM files of mach-* and plat-*
don't get coverage via a simple yesconfig build.  They will have
to be cleaned up and tested via using their respective configs.
