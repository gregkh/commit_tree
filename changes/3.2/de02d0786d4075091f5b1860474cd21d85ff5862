ASoC: Trace and collect statistics for DAPM graph walking

One of the longest standing areas for improvement in ASoC has been the
DAPM algorithm - it repeats the same checks many times whenever it is run
and makes no effort to limit the areas of the graph it checks meaning we
do an awful lot of walks over the full graph. This has never mattered too
much as the size of the graph has generally been small in relation to the
size of the devices supported and the speed of CPUs but it is annoying.

In preparation for work on improving this insert a trace point after the
graph walk has been done. This gives us specific timing information for
the walk, and in order to give quantifiable (non-benchmark) numbers also
count every time we check a link or check the power for a widget and report
those numbers. Substantial changes in the algorithm may require tweaks to
the stats but they should be useful for simpler things.
