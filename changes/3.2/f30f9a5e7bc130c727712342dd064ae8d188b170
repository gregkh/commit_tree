pata_sis: add mode_filter method for certain sis5513 chipsets

This mirrors a very old commit (3160d5416f39da9d9, "sis5513: add
->udma_filter method for chipset_family >= ATA_133") to the old sis5513
IDE driver that prevents certain setups from working.

UDMA6 (ATA/133) is not supported on some chipsets and we need to ensure
this mode is not chosen even if a connected drive supports it. Port this
old patch forward to the new PATA driver to ensure UDMA5 is the highest
mode used if that is what is supported.

Kernel bugzilla #41582.
