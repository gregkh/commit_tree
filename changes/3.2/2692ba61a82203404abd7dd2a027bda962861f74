sctp: fix incorrect overflow check on autoclose

Commit 8ffd3208 voids the previous patches f6778aab and 810c0719 for
limiting the autoclose value.  If userspace passes in -1 on 32-bit
platform, the overflow check didn't work and autoclose would be set
to 0xffffffff.

This patch defines a max_autoclose (in seconds) for limiting the value
and exposes it through sysctl, with the following intentions.

1) Avoid overflowing autoclose * HZ.

2) Keep the default autoclose bound consistent across 32- and 64-bit
   platforms (INT_MAX / HZ in this patch).

3) Keep the autoclose value consistent between setsockopt() and
   getsockopt() calls.
