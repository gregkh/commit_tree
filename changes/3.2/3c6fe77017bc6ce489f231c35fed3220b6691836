ext4: Don't normalize an falloc request if it can fit in 1 extent.

If an fallocate request fits in EXT_UNINIT_MAX_LEN, then set the
EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_NO_NORMALIZE flag. For larger fallocate requests,
let mballoc.c normalize the request.

This fixes a problem where large requests were being split into
non-contiguous extents due to commit 556b27abf73: ext4: do not
normalize block requests from fallocate.

Testing: 
*) Checked that 8.x MB falloc'ed files are still laid down next to
each other (contiguously).
*) Checked that the maximum size extent (127.9MB) is allocated as 1
extent.
*) Checked that a 1GB file is somewhat contiguous (often 5-6
non-contiguous extents now).
*) Checked that a 120MB file can still be falloc'ed even if there are
no single extents large enough to hold it.
