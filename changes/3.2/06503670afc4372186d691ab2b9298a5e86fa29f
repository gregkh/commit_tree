ALSA: hda/realtek - Choose more cleverly the primary outputs

When the speaker outputs are more than the headphone outputs, it implies
that the system has surround speakers while the headphones are only for
monitoring the front.  In such a case, it's better to put speakers as
the primary outputs so that the driver can build up and keep the
surround setup.  Otherwise the system will pick up the headphone as
primary, and offers less channels than the speakers do support.
