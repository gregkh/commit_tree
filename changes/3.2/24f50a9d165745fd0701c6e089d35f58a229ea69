mac80211: don't stop a single aggregation session twice

Nikolay noticed (by code review) that mac80211 can
attempt to stop an aggregation session while it is
already being stopped. So to fix it, check whether
stop is already being done and bail out if so.

Also move setting the STOPPING state into the lock
so things are properly atomic.
