net: drivers/net/hippi/Kconfig should be sourced

Commit ff5a3b509e ("hippi: Move the HIPPI driver") moved the HIPPI
driver into drivers/net/hippi. It didn't source
drivers/net/hippi/Kconfig though, so it didn't make all necessary
Kconfig changes. So let drivers/net/kconfig source HIPPI's Kconfig file.

[ Fix syntax error at the end of HIPP's Kconfig file. -DaveM ]
