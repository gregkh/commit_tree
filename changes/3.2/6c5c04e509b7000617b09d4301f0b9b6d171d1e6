ALSA: hda - Remove bad code for IDT 92HD83 family patch

The purpose of this patch is to remove a section of "bad" code that
assigns the last DAC to ports E or F in order to support notebooks
with docking in earlier days, around ALSA 1.0.19 - 21.  This is not
necessary now and actually breaks some configurations that use these
ports as other devices.  This have been tested on several different
configurations to make sure that it is working for different combinations.
