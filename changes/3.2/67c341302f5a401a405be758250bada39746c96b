ASoC: twl6040: Support for vibra output paths

twl6040 have two vibra output drivers.
They can be operated with audio stream coming through
the PDM interface (fifth channel).
The vibra outputs can be controlled via the input/FF
driver as well.
Selection between the two mode is implemented within
the codec driver, the input/FF driver can only operate if
the routing is set to "Input FF".
Changing from "Input FF" to "Audio PDM" mode is protected
as well: The switchin can only be done, if there is no
running effect from the input/FF.
