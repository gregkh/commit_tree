ARM: 7163/2: PL330: Only register usable channels

When the manager is running non-secure, the only channels that can
issue interrupts are the ones that have a 1 in their corresponding bit
in Configuration Register 3. The other ones will generate an abort
when trying to signal the end of the transaction so they are useless
in non-secure mode.
