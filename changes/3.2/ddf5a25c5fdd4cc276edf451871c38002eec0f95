ARM: unwinder: fix bisection to find origin in .idx section

The bisection implemented in unwind_find_origin() stopped to early.  If
there is only a single entry left to check the original code just took
the end point as origin which might be wrong.

This was introduced in commit de66a979012d ("ARM: 7187/1: fix unwinding
for XIP kernels").
