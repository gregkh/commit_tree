new helper: mount_subtree()

takes vfsmount and relative path, does lookup within that vfsmount
(possibly triggering automounts) and returns the result as root
of subtree suitable for return by ->mount() (i.e. a reference to
dentry and an active reference to its superblock grabbed, superblock
locked exclusive).

btrfs and nfs switched to it instead of open-coding the sucker.
