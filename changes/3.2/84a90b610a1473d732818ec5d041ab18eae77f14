Input: elantech - better support all those v2 variants

V2 hardware has many variants. This patch adddresses two issues:

 - some model also has debounce packets, but with a different signature
   than v3. Now we just check debounce for all v2 hardware.

 - due to different scanning methods the hardware uses, x and y ranges have
   to be calculated differently. And for some specific versions, we can just
   see them as custom-made, so set {x, y} the same values as Windows driver
   does.
