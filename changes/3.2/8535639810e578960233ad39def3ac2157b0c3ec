um: fix ubd cow size

ubd_file_size() cannot use ubd_dev->cow.file because at this time
ubd_dev->cow.file is not initialized.
Therefore, ubd_file_size() will always report a wrong disk size when
COW files are used.
Reading from /dev/ubd* would crash the kernel.

We have to read the correct disk size from the COW file's backing
file.
