mm: compaction: trivial clean up in acct_isolated()

acct_isolated of compaction uses page_lru_base_type which returns only
base type of LRU list so it never returns LRU_ACTIVE_ANON or
LRU_ACTIVE_FILE.  In addtion, cc->nr_[anon|file] is used in only
acct_isolated so it doesn't have fields in conpact_control.

This patch removes fields from compact_control and makes clear function of
acct_issolated which counts the number of anon|file pages isolated.
