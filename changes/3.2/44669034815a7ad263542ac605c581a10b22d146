mmc: core: Set correct bus mode before card init

Earlier all cards where initiated with bus mode set as OPENDRAIN, and then
later switched to PUSHPULL. According to the MMC/SD/SDIO specifications
only MMC cards use OPENDRAIN during init. For both SD and SDIO the bus
mode shall be PUSHPULL before attempting to init the card.

The consequence of having incorrect bus mode can lead to not being able
to detect the card. Therefore the default behavior have now been changed
to PUSHPULL in mmc_power_up, and will only be temporarily switched when
trying to attach or init a MMC card.
