staging: r8712u: Interface-state not fully tracked.

padapter->bup is True when the interface has been
brought Up. But it was not being reset when the
interface is taken Down.
This has not caused a known problem, as other
state variables may be compensating for it. Never
the less, it is now properly tracked.
