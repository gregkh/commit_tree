dmaengine/amba-pl08x: Changing few prints to dev_dbg from dev_info

For 8 memory and 16 slave channels 35 boot print lines are printed. And that is
too much. Most of this would be more useful for debugging. So moving few of them
to dev_dbg instead of dev_info. Now only 3 prints will be printed.

This also rearrange one of the debug message to fit into two lines.
