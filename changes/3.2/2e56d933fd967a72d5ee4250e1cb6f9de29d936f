[media] media: ov6650: stylistic improvements

* with no "retrun ret;" at the end, there is no need to initialize ret
  any longer,
* consequently use conditional expressions, not if...else constructs,
  throughout ov6650_s_ctrl(),
* v4l2_ctrl_new_std_menu() max value of V4L2_EXPOSURE_MANUAL instead of
  equivalent 1 looks more clear.
