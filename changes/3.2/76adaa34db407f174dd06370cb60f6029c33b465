drm: support routines for HDMI/DP ELD

ELD (EDID-Like Data) describes to the HDMI/DP audio driver the audio
capabilities of the plugged monitor.

This adds drm_edid_to_eld() for converting EDID to ELD. The converted
ELD will be saved in a new drm_connector.eld[128] data field. This is
necessary because the graphics driver will need to fixup some of the
data fields (eg. HDMI/DP connection type, AV sync delay) before writing
to the hardware ELD buffer. drm_av_sync_delay() will help the graphics
drivers dynamically compute the AV sync delay for fixing-up the ELD.

ELD selection policy: it's possible for one encoder to be associated
with multiple connectors (ie. monitors), in which case the first found
ELD will be returned by drm_select_eld(). This policy may not be
suitable for all users, but let's start it simple first.

The impact of ELD selection policy: assume there are two monitors, one
supports stereo playback and the other has 8-channel output; cloned
display mode is used, so that the two monitors are associated with the
same internal encoder. If only the stereo playback capability is reported,
the user won't be able to start 8-channel playback; if the 8-channel ELD
is reported, then user space applications may send 8-channel samples
down, however the user may actually be listening to the 2-channel
monitor and not connecting speakers to the 8-channel monitor.

According to James, many TVs will either refuse the display anything or
pop-up an OSD warning whenever they receive hdmi audio which they cannot
handle. Eventually we will require configurability and/or per-monitor
audio control even when the video is cloned.
