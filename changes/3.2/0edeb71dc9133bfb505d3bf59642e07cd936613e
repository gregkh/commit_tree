ext4: Create helper function for EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN and i_aiodio_unwritten

EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag set and the increase of i_aiodio_unwritten
should be done simultaneously since ext4_end_io_nolock always clear
the flag and decrease the counter in the same time.

We have found some bugs that the flag is set while leaving
i_aiodio_unwritten unchanged(commit 32c80b32c053d). So this patch just tries
to create a helper function to wrap them to avoid any future bug.
The idea is inspired by Eric.
