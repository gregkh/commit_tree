staging: wlags49_h2: Fixup IW_AUTH handling

Handle more cases in IW_AUTH.

Avoid reporting errors (invalid parameter) on operations that we
can't do anything with.

Return -EINPROGRESS from some operations to get wpa_supplicant to
batch and commit changes.

In other operations apply the changes immediately.

Avoid writing WEP keys from the commit handler when WEP is not
being used.

Accept WPA_VERSION_DISABLED, which is received from wpa_supplicant
during WEP.
