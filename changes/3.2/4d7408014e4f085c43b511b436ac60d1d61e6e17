video: da8xx-fb: Increased resolution configuration of revised LCDC IP

Revised LCD controller in upcoming TI SoC which is an updated version of
LCDC IP that was found on TI's DA850 SoC supports 2048*2048 resolution.
Below are the encoding details:
Width:
Pixels Per Line = {pplmsb, ppllsb, 4'b1111} + 1
Where pplmsb:1bit==>Raster Timing0[3], ppllsb:6bits==>Raster Timing0[9:4].
And encoded value can range from 16 to 2048 in multiples of 16.

Height:
Lines Per Panel = {lpp_b10, lpp}
Where lpp:10bits==>Raster Timing1[9:0], lpp_b10:1bit==>Raster Timing2[26].
And encoded value can range from 1 to 2048, programmable range is 0 to
2047.

Patch is verified on emulation platform of upcoming SoC for updated
feature and on DA850 platform to make sure nothing existing breaks.
