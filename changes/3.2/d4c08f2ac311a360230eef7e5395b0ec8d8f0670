rcu: Add grace-period, quiescent-state, and call_rcu trace events

Add trace events to record grace-period start and end, quiescent states,
CPUs noticing grace-period start and end, grace-period initialization,
call_rcu() invocation, tasks blocking in RCU read-side critical sections,
tasks exiting those same critical sections, force_quiescent_state()
detection of dyntick-idle and offline CPUs, CPUs entering and leaving
dyntick-idle mode (except from NMIs), CPUs coming online and going
offline, and CPUs being kicked for staying in dyntick-idle mode for too
long (as in many weeks, even on 32-bit systems).

rcu: Add the rcu flavor to callback trace events

The earlier trace events for registering RCU callbacks and for invoking
them did not include the RCU flavor (rcu_bh, rcu_preempt, or rcu_sched).
This commit adds the RCU flavor to those trace events.
