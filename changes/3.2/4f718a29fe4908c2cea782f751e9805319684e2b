firmware: Sigma: Prevent out of bounds memory access

The SigmaDSP firmware loader currently does not perform enough boundary size
checks when processing the firmware. As a result it is possible that a
malformed firmware can cause an out of bounds memory access.

This patch adds checks which ensure that both the action header and the payload
are completely inside the firmware data boundaries before processing them.
