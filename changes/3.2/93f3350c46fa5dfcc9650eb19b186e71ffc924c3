RS485: fix inconsistencies in the meaning of some variables

The crisv10.c and the atmel_serial.c serial drivers intepret the fields of the
serial_rs485 structure in a different way.

In particular, crisv10.c uses SER_RS485_RTS_AFTER_SEND and
SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND for the voltage of the RTS pin; atmel_serial.c,
instead, uses these values to know if a delay must be set before and
after sending.  This patch makes the usage of these variables consistent
across all drivers and fixes the Documentation as well.

From now on, SER_RS485_RTS_AFTER_SEND and SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND will be
used to set the voltage of the RTS pin (as in the crisv10.c driver); the
delay will be understood by looking only at the value of
delay_rts_before_send and delay_rts_after_send.
