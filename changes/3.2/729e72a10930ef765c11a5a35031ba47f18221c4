macvlan: receive multicast with local address

When implementing VRRP v2 using macvlan several problems were
discovered.  VRRP is weird in that all routers participating
in a redundant group use the same virtual MAC address.
Macvlan is a natural driver to use for this but it doesn't
work.  The problem is that packets with a macvlan device's
source address are not received.

The problem is actually a regression that date back almost 2 years now.
The original problems started with:

    macvlan: implement bridge, VEPA and private mode

This patches restores the original 2.6.32 behavior. Allowing multicast
packets received with the VRRP source address to be received.
