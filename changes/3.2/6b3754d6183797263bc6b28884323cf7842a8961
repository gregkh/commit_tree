devicetree: fix build error on drivers/tty/serial/altera_jtaguart.c

This patch fixes the following build error caused by commit
85888069cf5d ("tty: use of_match_ptr() for of_match_table entry").
The problem was a missing #include <linux/of.h> which is where
of_match_ptr() is defined.

drivers/tty/serial/altera_jtaguart.c:483:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'of_match_ptr' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/tty/serial/altera_jtaguart.c:483:34: error: 'altera_jtaguart_match' undeclared here (not in a function)
