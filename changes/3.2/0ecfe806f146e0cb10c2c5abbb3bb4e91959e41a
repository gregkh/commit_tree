mac80211: fix race between connection monitor & suspend

When the connection monitor timer fires right before
suspend, the following will happen:
 timer fires -> monitor_work gets queued
 suspend calls ieee80211_sta_quiesce
 ieee80211_sta_quiesce:
  - deletes timer
  - cancels monitor_work synchronously, running it
  [note wrong order of these steps]
 monitor_work runs, re-arming the timer
 later, timer fires while system should be quiesced

This causes a warning:

WARNING: at net/mac80211/util.c:540 ieee80211_can_queue_work+0x35/0x40 [mac80211]()

but is otherwise harmless. I'm not completely sure
this is the scenario Thomas stumbled across, but it
is the only way I can right now see the warning in
a scenario like the one he reported.
