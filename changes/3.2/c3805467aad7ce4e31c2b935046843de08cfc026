mmc: core: Put eMMC in Sleep mode before suspend

Put MMC to sleep if it supports SLEEP/AWAKE (CMD5) in the mmc suspend
so that Vcc (NAND core) can be cut to minimize power consumption.
eMMC put into SLEEP can respond to CMD0 or H/W reset or CMD5.
Current implemention on resume from suspend relies on CMD0 in
mmc_init_card to get out of SLEEP mode.
