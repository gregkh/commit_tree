stmmac: remove spin_lock in stmmac_ioctl.

This patch removes un-needed spin_lock in stmmac_ioctl while reading and
writing mdio registers. While holding spin_lock the code must be
atomic, which is not true in this case as both mdiobus_read and writes
have mutex locks.

Without this patch reading mdio registers via mii-tool results in below
BUG:
mii-tool -vvv eth0"
