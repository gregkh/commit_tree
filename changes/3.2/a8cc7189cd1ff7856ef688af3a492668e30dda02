ASoC: twl6040: Combine the custom volsw get, and put functions

We can manage with one set of get, and put function for the gain
controls we need to handle with custom code due to the shadowing
of the register.
For both get, and put function we can call decide based on the
mc->rreg value, if we need to call the volsw, or the vlosw_2r
variant (in 2r case rreg is not 0).
Handling of the shadow values are the same for both type of
controls.
