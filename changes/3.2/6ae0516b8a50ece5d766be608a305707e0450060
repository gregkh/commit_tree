block, cfq: fix empty queue crash caused by request merge

All requests of a queue could be merged to other requests of other queue.
Such queue will not have request in it, but it's in service tree. This
will cause kernel oops.
I encounter a BUG_ON() in cfq_dispatch_request() with next patch, but the
issue should exist without the patch.
