mtd: nand: handle ECC errors in OOB

While the standard NAND OOB functions do not do ECC on the spare area,
it is possible for a driver to supply its own OOB ECC functions (e.g., HW
ECC). nand_do_read_oob should act like nand_do_read_ops in checking the
ECC stats and returning -EBADMSG or -EUCLEAN on uncorrectable errors or
correctable bitflips, respectively. These error codes could be used in
flash-based BBT code or in YAFFS, for example.

Doing this, however, messes with the behavior of mtd_do_readoob. Now,
mtd_do_readoob should check whether we had -EUCLEAN or -EBADMSG errors
and discard those as "non-fatal" so that the ioctls can still succeed
with (possibly uncorrected) data.
