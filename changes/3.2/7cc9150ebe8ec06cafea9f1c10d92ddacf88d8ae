route: fix ICMP redirect validation

The commit f39925dbde7788cfb96419c0f092b086aa325c0f
(ipv4: Cache learned redirect information in inetpeer.)
removed some ICMP packet validations which are required by
RFC 1122, section 3.2.2.2:
...
  A Redirect message SHOULD be silently discarded if the new
  gateway address it specifies is not on the same connected
  (sub-) net through which the Redirect arrived [INTRO:2,
  Appendix A], or if the source of the Redirect is not the
  current first-hop gateway for the specified destination (see
  Section 3.3.1).
