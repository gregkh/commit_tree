sparc64: Fix MSIQ HV call ordering in pci_sun4v_msiq_build_irq().

This silently was working for many years and stopped working on
Niagara-T3 machines.

We need to set the MSIQ to VALID before we can set it's state to IDLE.

On Niagara-T3, setting the state to IDLE first was causing HV_EINVAL
errors.  The hypervisor documentation says, rather ambiguously, that
the MSIQ must be "initialized" before one can set the state.

I previously understood this to mean merely that a successful setconf()
operation has been performed on the MSIQ, which we have done at this
point.  But it seems to also mean that it has been set VALID too.
