ocfs2: Fix ocfs2_page_mkwrite()

This patch address two shortcomings in ocfs2_page_mkwrite():
1. Makes the function return better VM_FAULT_* errors.
2. It handles a error that is triggered when a page is dropped from the mapping
due to memory pressure. This patch locks the page to prevent that.

[Patch was cleaned up by Sunil Mushran.]
