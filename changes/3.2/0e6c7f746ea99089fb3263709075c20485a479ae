xhci-mem.c: Check for ring->first_seg != NULL

There are 2 situations wherein the xhci_ring* might not get freed:
- When xhci_ring_alloc() -> xhci_segment_alloc() returns NULL and
  we goto the fail: label in xhci_ring_alloc. In this case, the ring
  will not get kfreed.
- When the num_segs argument to xhci_ring_alloc is passed as 0 and
  we try to free the rung after that.
  ( This doesn't really happen as of now in the code but we seem to
    be entertaining num_segs=0 in xhci_ring_alloc )

This should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31.
