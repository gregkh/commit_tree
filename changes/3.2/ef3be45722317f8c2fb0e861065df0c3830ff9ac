Btrfs: check unused against how much space we actually want

There is a bug that may lead to early ENOSPC in our reservation code.  We've
been checking against num_bytes which may be above and beyond what we want to
actually reserve, which could give us a false ENOSPC.  Fix this by making sure
the unused space is above how much we want to reserve and not how much we're
trying to flush.  Thanks,
