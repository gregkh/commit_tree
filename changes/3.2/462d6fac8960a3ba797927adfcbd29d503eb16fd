Btrfs: introduce convert_extent_bit

If I have a range where I know a certain bit is and I want to set it to another
bit the only option I have is to call set and then clear bit, which will result
in 2 tree searches.  This is inefficient, so introduce convert_extent_bit which
will go through and set the bit I want and clear the old bit I don't want.
Thanks,
