target: Remove unnecessary se_task members

This is a squashed version of the following unnecessary se_task structure
member removal patches:

target: remove the task_execute_queue field in se_task

    Instead of using a separate flag we can simply do list_emptry checks
    on t_execute_list if we make sure to always use list_del_init to remove
    a task from the list.  Also factor some duplicate code into a new
    __transport_remove_task_from_execute_queue helper.

target: remove the read-only task_no field in se_task

    The task_no field never was initialized and only used in debug printks,
    so kill it.

target: remove the task_padded_sg field in se_task

    This field is only check in one place and not actually needed there.

    Rationale:
    - transport_do_task_sg_chain asserts that we have task_sg_chaining
      set early on
    - we only make use of the sg_prev_nents field we calculate based on it
      if there is another sg list that gets chained onto this one, which
      never happens for the last (or only) task.
