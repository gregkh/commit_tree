cifs: check for NULL last_entry before calling cifs_save_resume_key

Prior to commit eaf35b1, cifs_save_resume_key had some NULL pointer
checks at the top. It turns out that at least one of those NULL
pointer checks is needed after all.

When the LastNameOffset in a FIND reply appears to be beyond the end of
the buffer, CIFSFindFirst and CIFSFindNext will set srch_inf.last_entry
to NULL. Since eaf35b1, the code will now oops in this situation.

Fix this by having the callers check for a NULL last entry pointer
before calling cifs_save_resume_key. No change is needed for the
call site in cifs_readdir as it's not reachable with a NULL
current_entry pointer.

This should fix:
