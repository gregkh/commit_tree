ARM: pm: convert some assembly to C

Convert some of the sleep.S guts to C code, which makes it easier to
use our macros and to add L2 cache handling.  We provide a helper
function, __cpu_suspend_save(), which deals with saving the common
state, setting up for resume, and flushing caches.

The remainder left as assembly code is the saving of the CPU general
purpose registers, and allocating space on the stack to save the CPU
specific registers and resume state.
