slub: Remove useless statements in __slab_alloc

Two statements in __slab_alloc() do not have any effect.

1. c->page is already set to NULL by deactivate_slab() called right before.

2. gfpflags are masked in new_slab() before being passed to the page
   allocator. There is no need to mask gfpflags in __slab_alloc in particular
   since most frequent processing in __slab_alloc does not require the use of a
   gfpmask.
