genirq: fix regression in irqfixup, irqpoll

Commit fa27271bc8d2("genirq: Fixup poll handling") introduced a
regression that broke irqfixup/irqpoll for some hardware configurations.

Amidst reorganizing 'try_one_irq', that patch removed a test that
checked for 'action->handler' returning IRQ_HANDLED, before acting on
the interrupt.  Restoring this test back returns the functionality lost
since 2.6.39.  In the current set of tests, after 'action' is set, it
must precede '!action->next' to take effect.

With this and my previous patch to irq/spurious.c, c75d720fca8a, all
IRQ regressions that I have encountered are fixed.
