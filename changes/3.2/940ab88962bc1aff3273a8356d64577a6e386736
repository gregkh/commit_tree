drivercore: Add helper macro for platform_driver boilerplate

For simple modules that contain a single platform_driver without any
additional setup code then ends up being a block of duplicated
boilerplate.  This patch adds a new macro, module_platform_driver(),
which replaces the module_init()/module_exit() registrations with
template functions.
