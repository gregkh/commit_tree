evm: fix build problems

- Make the previously missing security_old_inode_init_security() stub
  function definition static inline.

- The stub security_inode_init_security() function previously returned
  -EOPNOTSUPP and relied on the callers to change it to 0.  The stub
  security/security_old_inode_init_security() functions now return 0.
