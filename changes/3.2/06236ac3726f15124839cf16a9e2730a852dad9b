net-netlink: Add a new attribute to expose TCLASS values via netlink

commit 3ceca749668a52bd795585e0f71c6f0b04814f7b added a TOS attribute.

Unfortunately TOS and TCLASS are both present in a dual-stack v6 socket,
furthermore they can have different values.  As such one cannot in a
sane way expose both through a single attribute.
