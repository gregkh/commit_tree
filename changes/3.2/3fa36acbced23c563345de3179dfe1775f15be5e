radix_tree: clean away saw_unset_tag leftovers

radix_tree_tag_get()'s BUG (when it sees a tag after saw_unset_tag) was
unsafe and removed in 2.6.34, but the pointless saw_unset_tag left behind.

Remove it now, and return 0 as soon as we see unset tag - we already rely
upon the root tag to be correct, returning 0 immediately if it's not set.
