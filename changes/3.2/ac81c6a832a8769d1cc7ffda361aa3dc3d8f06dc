[SCSI] libsas: fix sas_queuecommand return values

->queuecommand must return either 0, or one of the SCSI_MLQUEUE_* return
values.  Non-transient errors are indicated by setting cmd->result before
calling ->scsi_done and returning 0.  Fix libsas to adhere to this calling
convention.  Note that the DID_ERROR for returns from the low-level driver
might not be correct for all cases, but it's the best we can do with
the current layering in libsas.  I also suspect that the pre-existing
handling of -SAS_QUEUE_FULL should really be SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY, but
I'll leave that for a separate change.
