PM / Domains: Split device PM domain data into base and need_restore

The struct pm_domain_data data type is defined in such a way that
adding new fields specific to the generic PM domains code will
require include/linux/pm.h to be modified.  As a result, data types
used only by the generic PM domains code will be defined in two
headers, although they all should be defined in pm_domain.h and
pm.h will need to include more headers, which won't be very nice.

For this reason change the definition of struct pm_subsys_data
so that its domain_data member is a pointer, which will allow
struct pm_domain_data to be subclassed by various PM domains
implementations.  Remove the need_restore member from
struct pm_domain_data and make the generic PM domains code
subclass it by adding the need_restore member to the new data type.
