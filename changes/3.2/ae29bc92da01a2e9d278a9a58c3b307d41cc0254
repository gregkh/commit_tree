printk: remove bounds checking for log_prefix

Currently log_prefix is testing that the first character of the log level
and facility is less than '0' and greater than '9' (which is always
false).

Since the code being updated works because strtoul bombs out (endp isn't
updated) and 0 is returned anyway just remove the check and don't change
the behavior of the function.
