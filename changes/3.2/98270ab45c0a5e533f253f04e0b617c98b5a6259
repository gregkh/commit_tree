[SCSI] qla4xxx: Fixed session destroy issue on link up-down.

During link down, iscsid tries to do re-login to failed session. In case of
link down-up-down, LLD was sending connection login failed event to iscsid,
which is destroying the session, instead we have to continue re-login by
sending connection err event.
