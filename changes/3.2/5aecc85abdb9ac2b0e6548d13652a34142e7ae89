oom: do not kill tasks with oom_score_adj OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN

Commit c9f01245 ("oom: remove oom_disable_count") has removed the
oom_disable_count counter which has been used for early break out from
oom_badness so we could never select a task with oom_score_adj set to
OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN (oom disabled).

Now that the counter is gone we are always going through heuristics
calculation and we always return a non zero positive value.  This means
that we can end up killing a task with OOM disabled because it is
indistinguishable from regular tasks with 1% resp.  CAP_SYS_ADMIN tasks
with 3% usage of memory or tasks with oom_score_adj set but OOM enabled.

Let's break out early if the task should have OOM disabled.
