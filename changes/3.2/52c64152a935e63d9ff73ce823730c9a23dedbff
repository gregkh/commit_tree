md: bad blocks shouldn't cause a Blocked status on a Faulty device.

Once a device is marked Faulty the badblocks - whether acknowledged or
not - become irrelevant.  So they shouldn't cause the device to be
marked as Blocked.

Without this patch, a process might write "-blocked" to clear the
Blocked status, but while that will correctly fail the device, it
won't remove the apparent 'blocked' status.
