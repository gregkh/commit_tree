staging: zcache: reduce tmem bucket lock contention

tmem uses hash buckets each with their own rbtree and lock to
quickly lookup tmem objects.  tmem has TMEM_HASH_BUCKETS (256)
buckets per pool.  However, because of the way the tmem_oid is
generated for frontswap pages, only 16 unique tmem_oids are being
generated, resulting in only 16 of the 256 buckets being used.
This cause high lock contention for the per bucket locks.

This patch changes SWIZ_BITS to include more bits of the offset.
The result is that all 256 hash buckets are potentially used resulting in a
95% drop in hash bucket lock contention.
