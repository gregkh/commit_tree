arm: Add export.h to recently added files for EXPORT_SYMBOL

These files didn't exist at the time of the module.h split, and
so were not fixed by the commits on that baseline.  Since they use
the EXPORT_SYMBOL and/or THIS_MODULE macros, they will need the
new export.h file included that provides them.
