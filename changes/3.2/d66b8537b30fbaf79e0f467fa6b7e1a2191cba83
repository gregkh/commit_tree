ASoC: cs4720: use snd_soc_cache_sync()

Replace the manual register restore mechanism in cs4270.c and call the
generic snd_soc_cache_sync() handler instead.

This factors code out in favour of core facilities and also fixes a
bus confusion that is most probably caused by intermixing i2c-regmap
functions and i2c_smbus_* accessors.
