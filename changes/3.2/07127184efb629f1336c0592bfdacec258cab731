Btrfs: reduce the amount of space needed for truncates

With btrfs_truncate_inode_items we always return if we have to go to another
leaf, which makes us do our reservation again.  This means we will only ever
modify one leaf at a time, so we only need 1 items worth of slack space.  Also,
since we are deleting we will not be creating nodes as we go down, if anything
we'll be free'ing them as we merge them together, so make a different
calculation for truncate which will only have the worst case useage of COW'ing
the entire path down to the leaf.  Thanks,
