[S390] dasd: re-initialize read_conf buffer for retries

The buffer for read configuration data has to be initialized with an
EBCDIC string to show support for extended UIDs to z/VM.
If this read configuration data CQR needs to be retried, the buffer
may have changed in between. So re-initialize the buffer to get a
correct extended UID under z/VM.
