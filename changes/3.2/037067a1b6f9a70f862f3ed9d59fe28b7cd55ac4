rcu: Prohibit grace periods during early boot

Greater use of RCU during early boot (before the scheduler is operating)
is causing RCU to attempt to start grace periods during that time, which
in turn is resulting in both RCU and the callback functions attempting
to use the scheduler before it is ready.

This commit prevents these problems by prohibiting RCU grace periods
until after the scheduler has spawned the first non-idle task.
