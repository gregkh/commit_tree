platform: samsung_laptop: fix samsung brightness min/max calculations

The min_brightness value of the sabi_config is incorrectly used in brightness
calculations. For the config where min_brightness = 1 and max_brightness = 8,
the user visible range should be 0 to 7 with hardware being set in the range
of 1 to 8. What is actually happening is that the user visible range is 0 to
8 with hardware being set in the range of -1 to 7.

This patch fixes the above issue as well as a miscalculation that would occur
in the case of min_brightness > 1.
