[media] s5p-fimc: Adjust pixel height alignments according to the IP revision

Minimum vertical pixel size alignment for input and output DMA and
the scaler depend on color format, rotation, the IP instance and revision.

Make vertical pixel size of format and crop better fit for each SoC
revision and the IP instance by adding min_vsize_align attribute to
the FIMC variant data structure. It's now common for the DMA engines
and the scaler.
