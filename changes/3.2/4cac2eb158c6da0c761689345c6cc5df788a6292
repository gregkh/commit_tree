PCI hotplug: shpchp: don't blindly claim non-AMD 0x7450 device IDs

Previously we claimed device ID 0x7450, regardless of the vendor, which is
clearly wrong.  Now we'll claim that device ID only for AMD.

I suspect this was just a typo in the original code, but it's possible this
change will break shpchp on non-7450 AMD bridges.  If so, we'll have to fix
them as we find them.
