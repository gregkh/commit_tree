ARM: gpio: make trivial GPIOLIB implementation the default

Rather than marking the mach/gpio.h header files which want to use the
trivial GPIOLIB implementation, mark those which do not want to use it
instead.  This means that by default, you get the trivial implementation
and only have to do something extra if you need to.  This should
encourage the use of the trivial default implementation.

As an additional bonus, several gpio.h header files become empty.
