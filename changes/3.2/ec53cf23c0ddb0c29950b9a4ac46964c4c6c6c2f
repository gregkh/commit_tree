irq: don't put module.h into irq.h for tracking irqgen modules.

Recent commit "irq: Track the  owner of irq descriptor" in
commit ID b6873807a7143b7 placed module.h into linux/irq.h
but we are trying to limit module.h inclusion to just C files
that really need it, due to its size and number of children
includes.  This targets just reversing that include.

Add in the basic "struct module" since that is all we really need
to ensure things compile.  In theory, b687380 should have added the
module.h include to the irqdesc.h header as well, but the implicit
module.h everywhere presence masked this from showing up.  So give
it the "struct module" as well.

As for the C files, irqdesc.c is only using THIS_MODULE, so it
does not need module.h - give it export.h instead.  The C file
irq/manage.c is now (as of b687380) using try_module_get and
module_put and so it needs module.h (which it already has).

Also convert the irq_alloc_descs variants to macros, since all
they really do is is call the __irq_alloc_descs primitive.
This avoids including export.h and no debug info is lost.
