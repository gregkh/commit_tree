ARM: 7134/1: Revert "EXYNOS4: Fix routing timer interrupt to offline CPU"

This reverts commit 4bd0fe1c78623062263cf5ae875fd484c5b8256d.

This implementation can introduce a problem and 'ARM: SMP: fix
per cpu timer setup before the cpu is marked online' patch can
solve the cpu_oneline vs. cpu_active problem so that should be
reverted.
