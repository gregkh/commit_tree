Btrfs: avoid null dereference and leaks when bailing from open_ctree()

Fix bugs introduced by 6c41761f.  Firstly, after failing to allocate any
of the tree roots (first 'goto fail' in open_ctree()) we would
dereference a NULL fs_info pointer in free_fs_info().  Secondly, after
failures from init_srcu_struct(), setup_bdi() and new_inode() we would
leak all earlier allocated roots: fs_info fields haven't been
initialized yet so free_fs_info() is rendered useless.

Fix this by initializing fs_info pointer and fs_info fields before any
allocations happen.
