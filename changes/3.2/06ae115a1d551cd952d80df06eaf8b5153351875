rcu: Avoid having just-onlined CPU resched itself when RCU is idle

CPUs set rdp->qs_pending when coming online to resolve races with
grace-period start.  However, this means that if RCU is idle, the
just-onlined CPU might needlessly send itself resched IPIs.  Adjust
the online-CPU initialization to avoid this, and also to correctly
cause the CPU to respond to the current grace period if needed.
