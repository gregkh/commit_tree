RDMA/uverbs: Export XRC TGT QPs to user space

Allow user space to operate on XRC TGT QPs the same way as other types
of QPs, with one notable exception: since XRC TGT QPs may be shared
among multiple processes, the XRC TGT QP is allowed to exist beyond the
lifetime of the creating process.

The process that creates the QP is allowed to destroy it, but if the
process exits without destroying the QP, then the QP will be left bound
to the lifetime of the XRCD.

TGT QPs are not associated with CQs or a PD.
