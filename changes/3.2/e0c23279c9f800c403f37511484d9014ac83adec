vmscan: abort reclaim/compaction if compaction can proceed

If compaction can proceed, shrink_zones() stops doing any work but its
callers still call shrink_slab() which raises the priority and potentially
sleeps.  This is unnecessary and wasteful so this patch aborts direct
reclaim/compaction entirely if compaction can proceed.
