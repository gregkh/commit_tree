igb: consolidate creation of Tx buffer info and data descriptor

This change will combine the writes of tx_buffer_info and the Tx data
descriptors into a single function. The advantage of this is that we can
avoid needless memory reads from the buffer info struct and speed things up
by keeping the accesses to the local registers.
