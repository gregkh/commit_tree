xen/pciback: miscellaneous adjustments

This is a minor bugfix and a set of small cleanups; as it is not clear
whether this needs splitting into pieces (and if so, at what
granularity), it is a single combined patch.
- add a missing return statement to an error path in
  kill_domain_by_device()
- use pci_is_enabled() rather than raw atomic_read()
- remove a bogus attempt to zero-terminate an already zero-terminated
  string
- #define DRV_NAME once uniformly in the shared local header
- make DRIVER_ATTR() variables static
- eliminate a pointless use of list_for_each_entry_safe()
- add MODULE_ALIAS()
- a little bit of constification
- adjust a few messages
- remove stray semicolons from inline function definitions
