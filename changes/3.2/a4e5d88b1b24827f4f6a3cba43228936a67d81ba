ext4: update EOFBLOCKS flag on fallocate properly

EOFBLOCK_FL should be updated if called w/o FALLOCATE_FL_KEEP_SIZE
Currently it happens only if new extent was allocated.

TESTCASE:
fallocate test_file -n -l4096
fallocate test_file -l4096
Last fallocate cmd has updated size, but keept EOFBLOCK_FL set. And
fsck will complain about that.

Also remove ping pong in ext4_fallocate() in case of new extents,
where ext4_ext_map_blocks() clear EOFBLOCKS bit, and later
ext4_falloc_update_inode() restore it again.
