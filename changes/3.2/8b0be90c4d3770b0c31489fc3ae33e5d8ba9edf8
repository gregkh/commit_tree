b43/legacy: Remove firmware IDs

This removes the "FWxx" ID strings from the b43 and b43legacy
drivers. They were once used to match a specific driver revision
to a set of firmware files. However, this is hardly useful today.
Additionally, the IDs are not updated and maintained properly, so
they might mislead users.
