nohz: Fix update_ts_time_stat idle accounting

update_ts_time_stat currently updates idle time even if we are in
iowait loop at the moment. The only real users of the idle counter
(via get_cpu_idle_time_us) are CPU governors and they expect to get
cumulative time for both idle and iowait times.
The value (idle_sleeptime) is also printed to userspace by print_cpu
but it prints both idle and iowait times so the idle part is misleading.

Let's clean this up and fix update_ts_time_stat to account both counters
properly and update consumers of idle to consider iowait time as well.
If we do this we might use get_cpu_{idle,iowait}_time_us from other
contexts as well and we will get expected values.
