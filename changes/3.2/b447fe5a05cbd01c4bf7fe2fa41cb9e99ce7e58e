xfs: factor unwritten extent map manipulations out of xfs_bmapi

To further improve the readability of xfs_bmapi(), factor the
unwritten extent conversion out into a separate function. This
removes large block of logic from the xfs_bmapi() code loop and
makes it easier to see the operational logic flow for xfs_bmapi().
