ASoC: da7210: Add support for ALC and Noise suppression

This patch adds controls to set following ALC parameters,
 - Max gain, Min gain, Noise gain, Attack rate, Release rate and delay

It also adds a switch to enable/disable noise suppression.

As per DA7210 data sheet, ALC and noise suppression can be enabled
only if certain conditions are met. This condition checks are handled
by simply using "_EXT" version of controls to capture change events.
