wl12xx: fixes for hw_pg_ver and chip id reporting

Fix the value of PG version for 128x at sysfs, remove write permissions
from PG version (hw_pg_ver) in sysfs and add remove files
(hw_pg_ver,bt_coex_state) from sysfs while freeing hardware.
New macro names for register Fuse_data_2_1 depend on architecture.
Propagate chip id through wiphy in PLT mode which still not work of
a bug in ethtool.
