perf stat: Add -o and --append options

This patch adds an option (-o) to save the output of perf stat into a
file. You could do this with perf record but not with perf stat.
Instead, you had to fiddle with stderr to save the counts into a
separate file.

The patch also adds the --append option so that results can be
concatenated into a single file across runs. Each run of the tool is
clearly separated by a comment line starting with a hash mark. The -A
option of perf record is already used by perf stat, so we only add a
long option.

$ perf stat -o res.txt date
$ cat res.txt

 Performance counter stats for 'date':

The option can be combined with -x to make the output file much easier
to parse.
