ARM: 7054/1: arm/tegra: Delete custom gpio_to_irq, and irq_to_gpio

By not definining a custom gpio_to_irq, the default gpiolib version is
used, allowing platform consolidation.

irq_to_gpio is deprecated and in the process of being removed. Make that
happen now for ARM Tegra.

This also partially fixes the Tegra build; it was broken because gpio.h
referred to EINVAL, which wasn't always defined when <mach/gpio.h> was
included.
