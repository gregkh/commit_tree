memblock: add NO_BOOTMEM config symbol

With the NO_BOOTMEM symbol added architectures may now use the following
syntax to tell that they do not need bootmem:

	select NO_BOOTMEM

This is much more convinient than adding a new kconfig symbol which was
otherwise required.

Adding this symbol does not conflict with the architctures that already
define their own symbol.
