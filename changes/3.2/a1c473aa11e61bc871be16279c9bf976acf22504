pci: Clamp pcie_set_readrq() when using "performance" settings

When configuring the PCIe settings for "performance", we allow parents
to have a larger Max Payload Size than children and rely on children
Max Read Request Size to not be larger than their own MPS to avoid
having the host bridge generate responses they can't cope with.

However, various drivers in Linux call pci_set_readrq() with arbitrary
values, assuming this to be a simple performance tweak. This breaks
under our "performance" configuration.

Fix that by making sure the value programmed by pcie_set_readrq() is
never larger than the configured MPS for that device.
