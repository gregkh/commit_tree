[S390] fix possible deadlock in gmap_map_segment

Fix possible deadlock reported by lockdep:
qemu-system-s39/2963 is trying to acquire lock:
(&mm->mmap_sem){++++++}, at: gmap_alloc_table+0x9c/0x120
but task is already holding lock:
(&mm->mmap_sem){++++++}, at: gmap_map_segment+0xa6/0x27c

Actually gmap_alloc_table is the only called in gmap_map_segment with
mmap_sem held, thus it's safe to simply remove the inner lock.
