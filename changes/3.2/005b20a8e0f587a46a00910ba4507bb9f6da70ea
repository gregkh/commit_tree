virtio: Dont add "config" to list for !per_vq_vector

For the MSI but non-per_vq_vector case, the config/change vq
also gets added to the list of vqs that need to process the
MSI interrupt. This is not needed as config has it's own
handler (vp_config_changed). In any case, vring_interrupt()
finds nothing needs to be done on this vq.

I tested this patch by testing the "Fallback:" and "Finally
fall back" cases in vp_find_vqs(). Please review.
