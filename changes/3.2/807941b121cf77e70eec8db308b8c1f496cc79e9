KVM: x86 emulator: Use ctxt->_eip directly in do_insn_fetch_byte()

Instead of passing ctxt->_eip from insn_fetch() call sites, get it from
ctxt in do_insn_fetch_byte().  This is done by replacing the argument
_eip of insn_fetch() with _ctxt, which should be better than letting the
macro use ctxt silently in its body.

Though this changes the place where ctxt->_eip is incremented from
insn_fetch() to do_insn_fetch_byte(), this does not have any real
effect.
