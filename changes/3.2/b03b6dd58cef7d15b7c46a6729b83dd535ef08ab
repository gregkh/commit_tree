bridge: master device stuck in no-carrier state forever when in user-stp mode

When in user-stp mode, bridge master do not follow state of its slaves, so
after the following sequence of events it can stuck forever in no-carrier
state:
1) turn stp off
2) put all slaves down - master device will follow their state and also go in
no-carrier state
3) turn stp on with bridge-stp script returning 0 (go to the user-stp mode)
Now bridge master won't follow slaves' state and will never reach running
state.

This patch solves the problem by making user-stp and kernel-stp behavior
similar regarding master following slaves' states.
