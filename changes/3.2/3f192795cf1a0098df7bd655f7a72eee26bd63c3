enic: Add support for port profile association on a enic SRIOV VF

This patch touchs most of the enic port profile handling code.
Tried to break it into sub patches without success.

The patch mainly does the following:
- Port profile operations for a SRIOV VF are modified to work
  only via its PF
- Changes the port profile static struct in struct enic to a pointer.
  This is because a SRIOV PF has to now hold the port profile information
  for all its VF's
- Moved address registration for VF's during port profile ASSOCIATE time
- Most changes in port profile handling code are changes related to indexing
  into the port profile struct array of a PF for the VF port profile
