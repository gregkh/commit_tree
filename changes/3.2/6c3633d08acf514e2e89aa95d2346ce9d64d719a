[SCSI] scsi_dh: Implement match callback function

Some device handler types are not tied to the vendor/model
but rather to a specific capability. Eg ALUA is supported
if the 'TPGS' setting in the standard inquiry is set.
This patch implements a 'match' callback for device handler
which supersedes the original vendor/model lookup and
implements the callback for the ALUA handler.
