MD: Allow restarting an interrupted incremental recovery.

If an incremental recovery was interrupted, a subsequent
re-add will result in a full recovery, even though an
incremental should be possible (seen with raid1).

Solve this problem by not updating the superblock on the
recovering device until array is not degraded any longer.
