watchdog: sp805: Fix section mismatch in ID table.

The AMBA ID table is marked as __initdata, yet it is referenced by the
driver struct which is not.  This causes a (somewhat unhelpful) section
mismatch warning:

  WARNING: drivers/watchdog/sp805_wdt.o(.data+0x4c): Section mismatch in
           reference from the variable sp805_wdt_driver to the (unknown
           reference) .init.data:(unknown)

Fix this by removing the annotation.
