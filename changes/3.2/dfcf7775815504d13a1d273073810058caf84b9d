[SCSI] Fix out of spec CD-ROM problem with media change

Some CD-ROMs fail to report a media change correctly.  The specific
one for this patch simply fails to respond to commands, then gives a
UNIT ATTENTION after being reset which returns ASC/ASCQ 28/00.  This
is out of spec behaviour, but add a check in the eat CC/UA on reset
path to catch this case so the CD-ROM will function somewhat properly.
