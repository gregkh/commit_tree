EDAC, MCE, AMD: Print CPU number when reporting the error

Currently, correctable ECCs go through mcelog and do not print the scary
MCE banner. In that case, however, reporting the core where the CECC
happened is important information so dump it along with the decoded
string albeit at risk of having a minor redundancy.
