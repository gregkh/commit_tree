arm: add elf.h to arch/arm/kernel/ptrace.c

It was implicitly getting it via an implicit presence of module.h
but when we clean that up, we'll get a bunch of lines like this:

arch/arm/kernel/ptrace.c:764: error: 'NT_PRSTATUS' undeclared here (not in a function)
arch/arm/kernel/ptrace.c:765: error: 'ELF_NGREG' undeclared here (not in a function)
arch/arm/kernel/ptrace.c:776: error: 'NT_PRFPREG' undeclared here (not in a function)
