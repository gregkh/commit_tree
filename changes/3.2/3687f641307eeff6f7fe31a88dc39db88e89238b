USB: ftdi_sio: Support TI/Luminary Micro Stellaris BD-ICDI Board

Some Stellaris evaluation kits have the JTAG/SWD FTDI chip onboard,
and some, like EK-LM3S9B90, come with a separate In-Circuit Debugger
Interface Board. The ICDI board can also be used stand-alone, for
other boards and chips than the kit it came with. The ICDI has both
old style 20-pin JTAG connector and new style JTAG/SWD 10-pin 1.27mm
pitch connector.

Tested with EK-LM3S9B90, where the BD-ICDI board is included.
