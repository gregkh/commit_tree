xen-blkback: Implement discard requests ('feature-discard')

..aka ATA TRIM/SCSI UNMAP command to be passed through the frontend
and used as appropiately by the backend. We also advertise
certain granulity parameters to the frontend so it can plug them in.
If the backend is a realy device - we just end up using
'blkdev_issue_discard' while for loopback devices - we just punch
a hole in the image file.
