i825xx:xscale:8390:freescale: Fix Kconfig dependancies

i825xx and xscale are "sub" Kconfigs to NET_VENDOR_INTEL, so
NET_VENDOR_INTEL should contain ALL the dependencies of the
"sub" Kconfigs.

Same with 8390 is a "sub" Kconfig to NET_VENDOR_NATSEMI, so
NET_VENDOR_NATSEMI needs to contains ALL the dependencies.

Freescale Kconfig only had fs_enet as a sub Kconfig, and already
contained the needed dependencies, just cleaned up the dependencies.
