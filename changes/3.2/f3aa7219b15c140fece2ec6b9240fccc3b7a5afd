ASoC: ad193x: Fix define of AD193X_PLL_INPUT_MASK

Current code defines AD193X_PLL_INPUT_MASK as (~0x6) which is quite
different from other MASK defines.
To make it consistent with other mask defines, define AD193X_PLL_INPUT_MASK
as 0x6 and change the code accordingly.
I think this change improves the readability.
