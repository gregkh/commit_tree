iwlagn: iwl_tid_data moves to iwl-shared

The rate scaling and the transport need to access the data in
iwl_tid_data, hence the move.

Note that the only component in the upper layer that needs this data
is the rate scaling. Refactoring the rate scaling may help to move
iwl_tid_data from the shared area to the transport area.
