drivers/staging/crystalhd/: Fix a coding style issues

crystalhd_fw_if.h: indentation fix (spaces to tabs)
The rest are brackets.

NOTE: there are quite some 80 character warnings, but they look in place,
comments mostly on the right next to the constants and stuff like that. I
haven't touched them, since this rule is 'going away', but in case you would
like it to be fixed, let me know.

I'm sending 2 patches, but it they aren't connected in any way, so doesn't
matter the apply order. It's just a cleanup.

P.S sorry for the first lame patches a couple of days ago
