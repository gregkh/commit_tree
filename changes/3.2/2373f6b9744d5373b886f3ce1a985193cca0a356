i2c-designware: split of i2c-designware.c into core and bus specific parts

This patch splits i2c-designware.c into three pieces:
     i2c-designware-core.c, contains the code that interacts directly
     with the core.

     i2c-designware-platdrv.c, contains the code specific to the
     platform driver using the core.

     i2c-designware-core.h contains the definitions and declareations
     shared by i2c-designware-core.c and i2c-designware-platdrv.c.

This patch is the first in a set to allow multiple instances of the
designware I2C core in the system.
