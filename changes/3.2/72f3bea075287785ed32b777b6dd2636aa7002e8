powerpc/ps3: Fix lost SMP IPIs

Fixes the PS3 bootup hang introduced in 3.0-rc1 by:

  commit 317f394160e9beb97d19a84c39b7e5eb3d7815a
  sched: Move the second half of ttwu() to the remote cpu

Move the PS3's LV1 EOI call lv1_end_of_interrupt_ext() from ps3_chip_eoi()
to ps3_get_irq() for IPI messages.

If lv1_send_event_locally() is called between a previous call to
lv1_send_event_locally() and the coresponding call to
lv1_end_of_interrupt_ext() the second event will not be delivered to the
target cpu.

The PS3's SMP IPIs are implemented using lv1_send_event_locally(), so if two
IPI messages of the same type are sent to the same target in a relatively
short period of time the second IPI event can become lost when
lv1_end_of_interrupt_ext() is called from ps3_chip_eoi().
