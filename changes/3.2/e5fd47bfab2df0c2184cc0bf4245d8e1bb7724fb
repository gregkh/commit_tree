xen/pm_idle: Make pm_idle be default_idle under Xen.

The idea behind commit d91ee5863b71 ("cpuidle: replace xen access to x86
pm_idle and default_idle") was to have one call - disable_cpuidle()
which would make pm_idle not be molested by other code.  It disallows
cpuidle_idle_call to be set to pm_idle (which is excellent).

But in the select_idle_routine() and idle_setup(), the pm_idle can still
be set to either: amd_e400_idle, mwait_idle or default_idle.  This
depends on some CPU flags (MWAIT) and in AMD case on the type of CPU.

In case of mwait_idle we can hit some instances where the hypervisor
(Amazon EC2 specifically) sets the MWAIT and we get:

  Brought up 2 CPUs
  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP

  Pid: 0, comm: swapper Not tainted 3.1.0-0.rc6.git0.3.fc16.x86_64 #1
  RIP: e030:[<ffffffff81015d1d>]  [<ffffffff81015d1d>] mwait_idle+0x6f/0xb4

  RIP  [<ffffffff81015d1d>] mwait_idle+0x6f/0xb4
   RSP <ffff8801d28ddf10>

In the case of amd_e400_idle we don't get so spectacular crashes, but we
do end up making an MSR which is trapped in the hypervisor, and then
follow it up with a yield hypercall.  Meaning we end up going to
hypervisor twice instead of just once.

The previous behavior before v3.0 was that pm_idle was set to
default_idle regardless of select_idle_routine/idle_setup.

We want to do that, but only for one specific case: Xen.  This patch
does that.
