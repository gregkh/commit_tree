[S390] Remove error checking from copy_oldmem_page()

Currently it can happen that the pre-allocated ELF header contains a wrong
memory map which would result in errors when copying /proc/vmcore.
In order to still get a valid vmcore, we (temporarily) disable the error
checking in copy_oldmem_page(). This will then produce zero pages for those
memory regions.
