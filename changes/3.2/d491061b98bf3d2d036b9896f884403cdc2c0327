Staging: bcm: Fix assignment issue in if statement reported by checkpatch.pl.

This patch fixes an error where an assignment "="
was being used in an if statement to determine if
Firmware was downloaded. This patch removes that
assignment, and places it above the if statement.
The if statement then evaluates the status to
verify if "0" successful, or != 0 failure.
