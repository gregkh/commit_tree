ARM: 7102/1: mach-integrator: update defconfig

Update the Integrator defconfig with some sensible defaults:
- Compile a combined image supporting Integrator/AP and
  Integrator/CP, with the core modules CM720, CM920, CM922,
  CM926, CM1020, CM1022 and CM1026 in a single image, this
  works just fine and gives some nice compilation coverage
- NOHZ (tickless) and HRTIMERS turned on
- Compile using EABI, let's assume recent compilers are used
  now (tested using GCC 4.4.1)
- Remove forced 32MiB at command line, the bootloader usually
  knows this better, and my U-Boot patches nowadays make that
  boot loader pass the correct adjusted value
- Enable the MTD Physmap flash driver, so that the changes done
  earlier by Marc Zyngier replacing integrator-flash takes
  effect
- Enable the PL030 RTC driver that has not been default-compiled
  with any config for a while

This has been tested on the real hardware Integrator AP with
both an ARM920T and ARM926EJ-S core module.
