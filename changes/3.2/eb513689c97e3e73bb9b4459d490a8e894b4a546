ext4: ignore journalled data options on remount if fs has no journal

This avoids a confusing failure in the init scripts when the
/etc/fstab has data=writeback or data=journal but the file system does
not have a journal.  So check for this case explicitly, and warn the
user that we are ignoring the (pointless, since they have no journal)
data=* mount option.
