USB: add RESET_RESUME for webcams shown to be quirky

The new runtime PM code has shown that many webcams suffer
from a race condition that may crash them upon resume.
Runtime PM is especially prone to show the problem because
it retains power to the cameras at all times. However
system suspension may also crash the devices and retain
power to the devices.
The only way to solve this problem without races is in
usbcore with the RESET_RESUME quirk.
