ARM: perf: initialise used_mask for fake PMU during validation

When validating an event group, we call pmu->get_event_idx for each
group member in order to check that the group can be scheduled as a
unit on an empty PMU.

As a result of 3fc2c830 ("ARM: perf: remove event limit from
pmu_hw_events"), the used_mask member of struct cpu_hw_events must be
setup explicitly, something which we don't do for the fake cpu_hw_events
used for validation.

This patch sets up an empty used_mask for the fake validation
cpu_hw_events, preventing NULL deferences when trying to get the event
index.
