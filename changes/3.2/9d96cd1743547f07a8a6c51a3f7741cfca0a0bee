tracing/filter: Separate predicate init and filter addition

Making the code cleaner by having one function to fully prepare
the predicate (create_pred), and another to add the predicate to
the filter (filter_add_pred).

As a benefit, this way the dry_run flag stays only inside the
replace_preds function and is not passed deeper.
