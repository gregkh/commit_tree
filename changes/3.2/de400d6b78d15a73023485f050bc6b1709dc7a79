[S390] fix mismatch in summation of I/O IRQ statistics

Current IRQ statistics support does not show detail counts for I/O
interrupts which are processed internally only. The result is a
summation count which is way off such as this one:

           CPU0       CPU1       CPU2
I/O:       1331        710        442
[...]
QAI:         15         16         16   [I/O] QDIO Adapter Interrupt
QDI:          1          0          0   [I/O] QDIO Interrupt
DAS:        706        645        381   [I/O] DASD
C15:         26         10          0   [I/O] 3215
C70:          0          0          0   [I/O] 3270
TAP:          0          0          0   [I/O] Tape
VMR:          0          0          0   [I/O] Unit Record Devices
LCS:          0          0          0   [I/O] LCS
CLW:          0          0          0   [I/O] CLAW
CTC:          0          0          0   [I/O] CTC
APB:          0          0          0   [I/O] AP Bus

Fix this by moving I/O interrupt accounting into the common I/O layer.
