PM / Runtime: Fix kerneldoc comment for rpm_suspend()

This patch fix kerneldoc comments for rpm_suspend():

 - 'Cancel a pending idle notification' should be put before, also
   should be changed to 'Cancel a pending idle notification,
   autosuspend or suspend'.

 - idle notification for the device after succeeding suspend has
   been removed, so update the comment accordingly.

[rjw: Modified the subject and changelog slightly.]
