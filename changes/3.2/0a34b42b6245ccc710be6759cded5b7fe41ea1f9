ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix lost speaker volume controls

When there are the same or more number of HP pins are available, HP pins
are used as the primary outputs instead of the speaker pins.  But, in
some cases (especially with ALC663 & co), some DACs are available only
with a later pin and it's assigned to a speaker, and since the driver
parses the pins from the lower NID, such a DAC was skipped eventually
without assignments.  This resulted in a regression, the missing speaker
volume control in the new parser.

As a workaround for this, now the driver retries the pin->DAC mapping
again after restoring the speaker-pins as primary.  This is still an ad
hoc fix, but it works so far for most of Realtek codecs.
