staging: vme: change static device array to pointers

Change the static array of 'struct device''s in struct vme_bridge
to instead use an array of pointers. This is in accordance with the
requirement that all kobjects be dynamically allocated (see
Documentation/kobject.txt) and never be statically allocated.
