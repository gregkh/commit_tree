net: linkwatch: allow vlans to get carrier changes faster

There is a time-lag of IFF_RUNNING flag consistency between vlan and
real devices when the real devices are in problem such as link or cable
broken.

This leads to a degradation of Availability such as a delay of failover
in HA systems using vlan since the detection of the problem at real
device is delayed.

We can avoid the linkwatch delay (~1 sec) for devices linked to another
ones, since delay is already done for the realdev.
