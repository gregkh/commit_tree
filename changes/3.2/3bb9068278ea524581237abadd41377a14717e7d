loop: prevent information leak after failed read

If read was not fully successful we have to fail whole bio to prevent
information leak of old pages

##Testcase_begin
dd if=/dev/zero of=./file bs=1M count=1
losetup /dev/loop0 ./file -o 4096
truncate -s 0 ./file
# OOps loop offset is now beyond i_size, so read will silently fail.
# So bio's pages would not be cleared, may which result in information leak.
hexdump -C /dev/loop0
##testcase_end
