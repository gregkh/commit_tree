x86: geode: New PCEngines Alix system driver

This new driver replaces the old PCEngines Alix 2/3 LED driver with a
new driver that controls the LEDs through the leds-gpio driver. The
old driver accessed GPIOs directly, which created a conflict and
prevented also loading the cs5535-gpio driver to read other GPIOs on
the Alix board. With this new driver, we hook into leds-gpio which in
turn uses GPIO to control the LEDs and therefore it's possible to
control both the LEDs and access onboard GPIOs

Driver is moved to platform/geode as requested by Grant and any other
geode initialisation modules should move here also

This driver is inspired by leds-net5501.c by Alessandro Zummo.

Ideally, leds-net5501.c should also be moved to platform/geode. 
Additionally the driver relies on parts of the patch: 7f131cf3ed ("leds:
leds-alix2c - take port address from MSR) by Daniel Mack to perform
detection of the Alix board.
