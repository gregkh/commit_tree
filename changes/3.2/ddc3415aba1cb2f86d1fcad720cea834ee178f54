xfs: simplify xfs_trans_ijoin* again

There is no reason to keep a reference to the inode even if we unlock
it during transaction commit because we never drop a reference between
the ijoin and commit.  Also use this fact to merge xfs_trans_ijoin_ref
back into xfs_trans_ijoin - the third argument decides if an unlock
is needed now.

I'm actually starting to wonder if allowing inodes to be unlocked
at transaction commit really is worth the effort.  The only real
benefit is that they can be unlocked earlier when commiting a
synchronous transactions, but that could be solved by doing the
log force manually after the unlock, too.
