PM / Hibernate: Add resumedelay kernel param in addition to resumewait

Patch "PM / Hibernate: Add resumewait param to support MMC-like
devices as resume file" added the resumewait kernel command line
option.  The present patch adds resumedelay so that
resumewait/delay were analogous to rootwait/delay.

[rjw: Modified the subject and changelog slightly.]
