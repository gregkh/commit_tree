mfd: Base interrupt for twl4030-irq must be one-shot

As the interrupt source is only cleared by the threaded interrupt
service routine, we need to make the base interrupt IRQF_ONESHOT.
Without this, the first interrupt from the TWL4030 cause the CPU to
enter an infinite loop trying to handle to interrupt but never
clearing it.
