ALSA: HDA: Set position fix to LPIB for an Atom/Poulsbo based device

For the Asus 1101HA, reporting position by reading the DMA position
buffer map seems unstable and often wrong. The reporter says that
position_fix=LPIB works much better (although not 100%, but this is
probably due to other issues).

The controller chip is an Intel Poulsbo 8086:811b (rev 07) controller,
and complete alsa-info is available here:
