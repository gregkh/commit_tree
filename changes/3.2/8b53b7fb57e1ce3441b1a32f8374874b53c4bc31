mx3fb: fix NULL pointer dereference in screen blanking.

When blanking an already blanked framebuffer, a kernel NULL pointer
dereference occurred, because mx3fb driver handles all kinds of screen
blanking (normal, vsync suspend, powerdown) in the same way.
Certain programs (Xorg X11 server) first do a normal blank, followed by
a powerdown blank, which triggered the bug.

Add an additional safeguard and make sdc_disable_channel() safe against
multiple calls independent of other logic.
