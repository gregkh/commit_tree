candev: allow SJW user setting for bittiming calculation

This patch adds support for SJW user settings to not set the synchronization
jump width (SJW) to 1 in any case when using the in-kernel bittiming
calculation.

The ip-tool from iproute2 already supports to pass the user defined SJW
value. The given SJW value is sanitized with the controller specific sjw_max
and the calculated tseg2 value. As the SJW can have values up to 4 providing
this value will lead to the maximum possible SJW automatically. A higher SJW
allows higher controller oscillator tolerances.
