[media] V4L: mx3-camera: prepare to support multi-size buffers

Prepare the mx3_camera friver to support the new VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS and
VIDIOC_PREPARE_BUF ioctl()s. The .queue_setup() vb2 operation must be
able to handle buffer sizes, provided by the caller, and the
.buf_prepare() operation must not use the currently configured frame
format for its operation, which makes it superfluous for this driver.
Its functionality is moved into .buf_queue().
