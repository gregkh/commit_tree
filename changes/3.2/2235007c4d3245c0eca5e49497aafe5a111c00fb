target: add back error handling in transport_complete_task

The commit

    target: use a workqueue for I/O completions

accidentally removed setting t_tasks_failed in transport_complete_task.
Add it back in a slightly cleaner way; now it is set for every failed task
instead of special casing the last one completing by using the success
argument directly for it.
