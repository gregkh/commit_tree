CIFS: remove local xattr definitions

Local XATTR_TRUSTED_PREFIX_LEN and XATTR_SECURITY_PREFIX_LEN definitions
redefined ones in 'linux/xattr.h'. This was caused by commit 9d8f13ba3f48
("security: new security_inode_init_security API adds function callback")
including 'linux/xattr.h' in 'linux/security.h'.

                 from fs/cifs/xattr.c:26:

This patch removes the local definitions.
