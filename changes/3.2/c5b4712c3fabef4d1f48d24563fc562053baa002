x86, ioapic: Split up setup_ioapic_entry()

Ingo pointed out that setup_ioapic_entry() is way too big now.

Split the intr-remap code out into setup_ir_ioapic_entry().

Also pass struct io_apic_irq_attr * instead of 5 parameters
in those two functions.

At last in setup_ir_ioapic_entry() we don't need to panic.
