dm kcopyd: add dm_kcopyd_zero to zero an area

This patch introduces dm_kcopyd_zero() to make it easy to use
kcopyd to write zeros into the requested areas instead
instead of copying.  It is implemented by passing a NULL
copying source to dm_kcopyd_copy().

The forthcoming thin provisioning target uses this.
