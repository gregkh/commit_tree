PM / Hibernate: Improve performance of LZO/plain hibernation, checksum image

Use threads for LZO compression/decompression on hibernate/thaw.
Improve buffering on hibernate/thaw.
Calculate/verify CRC32 of the image pages on hibernate/thaw.

In my testing, this improved write/read speed by a factor of about two.
