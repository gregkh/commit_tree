module: Enable dynamic debugging regardless of taint

Dynamic debugging is currently disabled for tainted modules, except
for TAINT_CRAP.  This prevents use of dynamic debugging for
out-of-tree modules once the next patch is applied.

This condition was apparently intended to avoid a crash if a force-
loaded module has an incompatible definition of dynamic debug
structures.  However, a administrator that forces us to load a module
is claiming that it *is* compatible even though it fails our version
checks.  If they are mistaken, there are any number of ways the module
could crash the system.

As a side-effect, proprietary and other tainted modules can now use
dynamic_debug.
