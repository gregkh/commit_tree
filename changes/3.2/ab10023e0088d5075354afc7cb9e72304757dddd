cpu_pm: Add cpu power management notifiers

During some CPU power modes entered during idle, hotplug and
suspend, peripherals located in the CPU power domain, such as
the GIC, localtimers, and VFP, may be powered down.  Add a
notifier chain that allows drivers for those peripherals to
be notified before and after they may be reset.

Notified drivers can include VFP co-processor, interrupt controller
and it's PM extensions, local CPU timers context save/restore which
shouldn't be interrupted. Hence CPU PM event APIs  must be called
with interrupts disabled.
