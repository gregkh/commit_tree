ARM: perf: add type field to struct arm_pmu

Currently, the ARM perf code assumes all PMUs it will handle are
CPU PMUs, having ARM_PMU_DEVICE_CPU hardcoded when reserving or
releasing hardware. This means that currently, the ARM perf code can't
support system PMUs.

This patch adds a 'type' field to struct arm_pmu, which allows the code
to reserve & release the hardware regardless of the PMU type.
