ARM: 7172/1: dma: Drop GFP_COMP for DMA memory allocations

dma_alloc_coherent wants to split pages after allocation in order to
reduce the memory footprint. This does not work well with GFP_COMP
pages, so drop this flag before allocation.

This patch is ported from arch/avr32
(commit 3611553ef985ef7c5863c8a94641738addd04cff).
