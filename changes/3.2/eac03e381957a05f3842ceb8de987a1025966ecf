cfg80211: hold reg_mutex when updating regulatory

The function wiphy_update_regulatory() uses the static variable
last_request and thus needs to be called with reg_mutex held.
This is the case for all users in reg.c, but the function was
exported for use by wiphy_register(), from where it is called
without the lock being held.

Fix this by making wiphy_update_regulatory() private and introducing
regulatory_update() as a wrapper that acquires and holds the lock.
