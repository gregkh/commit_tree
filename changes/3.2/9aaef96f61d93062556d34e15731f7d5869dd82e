x86, mce: Do not call del_timer_sync() in IRQ context

del_timer_sync() can cause a deadlock when called in interrupt context.
It is used with on_each_cpu() in some parts for sysfs files like bank*,
check_interval, cmci_disabled and ignore_ce.

However, use of on_each_cpu() results in calling the function passed
as the argument in interrupt context. This causes a flood of nested
warnings from del_timer_sync() (it runs on each CPU) caused even by a
simple file access like:

$ echo 300 > /sys/devices/system/machinecheck/machinecheck0/check_interval

Fortunately, these MCE-specific files are rarely used and AFAIK only few
MCE geeks experience this warning.

To remove the warning, move timer deletion outside of the interrupt
context.
