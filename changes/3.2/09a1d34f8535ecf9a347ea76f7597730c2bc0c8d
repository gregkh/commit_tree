nohz: Make idle/iowait counter update conditional

get_cpu_{idle,iowait}_time_us update idle/iowait counters
unconditionally if the given CPU is in the idle loop.

This doesn't work well outside of CPU governors which are singletons
so nobody (except for IRQ) can race with them.

We will need to use both functions from /proc/stat handler to properly
handle nohz idle/iowait times.

Make the update depend on a non NULL last_update_time argument.
