perf hists: Don't decay total_period for filtered entries

Following the 'perf report' model we don't zap hist_entry instances from
the rb tree, we just keep them with he->filtered set to a mask of the
filters applied to it (thread, parent, DSO so far).

In top we need to decay even filtered entries, but we better not touch
total_period for them...

Now everything seems to work when filters are applied on top as they
worked in 'report', i.e. both dynamic and static hist entry browsing
works with filters.
