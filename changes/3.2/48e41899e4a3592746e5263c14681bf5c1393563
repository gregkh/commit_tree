printk: fix bounds checking for log_prefix

Currently log_prefix is testing that the first character of the log level
and facility is less than '0' and greater than '9' (which is always
false).  It should be testing to see if the character less than '0' or
greater than '9' instead.  This patch makes that change.

The code being changed worked because strtoul bombs out (endp isn't
updated) and 0 is returned anyway.
