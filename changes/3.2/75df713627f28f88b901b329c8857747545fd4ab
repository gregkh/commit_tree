block: document blk-plug

Thus spake Andrew Morton:

"And I have the usual maintainability whine.  If someone comes up to
vmscan.c and sees it calling blk_start_plug(), how are they supposed to
work out why that call is there?  They go look at the blk_start_plug()
definition and it is undocumented.  I think we can do better than this?"

Axboe and from an earlier attempt by Shaohua Li to document blk-plug.
