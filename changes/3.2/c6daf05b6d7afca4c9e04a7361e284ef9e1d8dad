video: da8xx-fb: Interrupt configuration of revised LCDC IP

An upcoming SoC of TI comes with an LCD controller which is an updated
version of that found on TI's DA850 SoC. The da8xx-fb driver can support
this LCD with some enhancements.
This patch adds support for updated interrupt configuration on the new
SoC.
1) Registers for setting and clearing interrupts are different.
2) Raw and masked status registers are different.
The updates have been tested on an emulation platform for new features
and the patch has been tested on DA850 platform to make sure nothing
existing breaks.
