kernel: Map most files to use export.h instead of module.h

The changed files were only including linux/module.h for the
EXPORT_SYMBOL infrastructure, and nothing else.  Revector them
onto the isolated export header for faster compile times.

Nothing to see here but a whole lot of instances of:

  -#include <linux/module.h>
  +#include <linux/export.h>

This commit is only changing the kernel dir; next targets
will probably be mm, fs, the arch dirs, etc.
