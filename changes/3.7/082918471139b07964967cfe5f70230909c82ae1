drm/radeon: Don't destroy I2C Bus Rec in radeon_ext_tmds_enc_destroy().

radeon_i2c_fini() walks thru the list of I2C bus recs rdev->i2c_bus[]
to destroy each of them.
radeon_ext_tmds_enc_destroy() however also has code to destroy it's
associated I2C bus rec which has been obtained by radeon_i2c_lookup()
and is therefore also in the i2c_bus[] list.
This causes a double free resulting in a kernel panic when unloading
the radeon driver.
Removing destroy code from radeon_ext_tmds_enc_destroy() fixes this
problem.
