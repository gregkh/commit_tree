ARM: OMAP1: Move SoC specific headers from plat to mach for omap1

There's no need to have these in plat-omap any longer. Note that these
could eventually be made local to mach-omap1 instead of being in mach.

But to do that, at least various driver access using omap7xxx.h registers
needs to be fixed first.
