printk: Fix scheduling-while-atomic problem in console_cpu_notify()

The console_cpu_notify() function runs with interrupts disabled in the
CPU_DYING case.  It therefore cannot block, for example, as will happen
when it calls console_lock().  Therefore, remove the CPU_DYING leg of
the switch statement to avoid this problem.
