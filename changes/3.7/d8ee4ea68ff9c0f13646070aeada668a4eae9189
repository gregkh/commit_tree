serial: omap: don't access the platform_device

The driver doesn't need to know about its platform_device.

Everything the driver needs can be done through the
struct device pointer. In case we need to use the
OMAP-specific PM function pointers, those can make
sure to find the device's platform_device pointer
so they can find the struct omap_device through
pdev->archdata field.
