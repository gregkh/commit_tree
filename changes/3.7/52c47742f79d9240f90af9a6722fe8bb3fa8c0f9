leds: triggers: send uevent when changing triggers

Some triggers create sysfs files when they are enabled. Send a uevent
"change" notification whenever the trigger is changed to allow userspace
processes such as udev to modify permissions on the new files.

A change notification will also be sent during registration of led class
devices or led triggers if the default trigger of an led class device
is found.
