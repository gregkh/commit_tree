PM / Sleep: introduce dpm_for_each_dev

dpm_list and its pm lock provide a good way to iterate all
devices in system. Except this way, there is no other easy
way to iterate devices in system.

firmware loader need to cache firmware images for devices
before system sleep, so introduce the function to meet its
demand.
