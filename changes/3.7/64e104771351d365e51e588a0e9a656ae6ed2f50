device_cgroup: fix unchecked cgroup parent usage

In 4cef7299b478687 ("device_cgroup: add proper checking when changing
default behavior") the cgroup parent usage is unchecked.  root will not
have a parent and trying to use device.{allow,deny} will cause problems.
For some reason my stressing scripts didn't test the root directory so I
didn't catch it on my regular tests.
