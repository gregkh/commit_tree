[media] saa7146: remove V4L2_FL_LOCK_ALL_FOPS

Add proper locking to the file operations, allowing for the removal
of the V4L2_FL_LOCK_ALL_FOPS flag.

I also removed some dead code in the form of the saa7146_devices list and
saa7146_devices_lock mutex: these were used once but that was a long time
ago.
