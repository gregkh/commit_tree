KVM: PPC: book3s: fix build error caused by gfn_to_hva_memslot()

The build error was caused by that builtin functions are calling
the functions implemented in modules. This error was introduced by
commit 4d8b81abc4 ("KVM: introduce readonly memslot").

The patch fixes the build error by moving function __gfn_to_hva_memslot()
from kvm_main.c to kvm_host.h and making that "inline" so that the
builtin function (kvmppc_h_enter) can use that.
