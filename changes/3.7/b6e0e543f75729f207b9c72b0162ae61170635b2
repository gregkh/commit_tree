    drm/i915: make sure we write all the DIP data bytes

we need to clear the entire sdvo buffer to avoid upsetting the
display.

Since infoframe buffer writing is now a bit more elaborate, extract it
into it's own function. This will be useful if we ever get around to
properly update the ELD for sdvo. Also #define proper names for the
two buffer indexes with fixed usage.

v2: Cite the right commit above, spotted by Paulo Zanoni.

v3: I'm too stupid to paste the right commit.

v4: Ben Hutchings noticed that I've failed to handle an underflow in
my loop logic, breaking it for i >= length + 8. Since I've just lost C
programmer license, use his solution. Also, make the frustrated 0-base
buffer size a notch more clear.
