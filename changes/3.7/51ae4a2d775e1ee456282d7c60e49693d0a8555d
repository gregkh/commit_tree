x86, smap: Add a header file with macros for STAC/CLAC

The STAC/CLAC instructions are only available with SMAP, but on the
other hand they aren't needed if SMAP is not available, or before we
start to run userspace, so construct them as alternatives which start
out as noops and are enabled by the alternatives mechanism.
