perf tool: Precise mode requires exclude_guest

Summary of events per Peter:

  "Intel PEBS in VT-x context uses the DS address as a guest linear address,
  even though its programmed by the host as a host linear address. This
  either results in guest memory corruption and or the hardware faulting and
  'crashing' the virtual machine.  Therefore we have to disable PEBS on VT-x
  enter and re-enable on VT-x exit, enforcing a strict exclude_guest.

  AMB IBS does work but doesn't currently support exclude_* at all,
  setting an exclude_* bit will make it fail."

This patch handles userspace perf command, setting the exclude_guest
attribute if precise mode is requested, but only if a user has not
specified a request for guest or host only profiling (G or H attribute).

Kernel side AMD currently ignores all exclude_* bits, so there is no impact
to existing IBS code paths. Robert Richter has a patch where IBS code will
return EINVAL if an exclude_* bit is set. When this goes in it means use
of :p on AMD with IBS will first fail with EINVAL (because exclude_guest
will be set). Then the existing fallback code within perf will unset
exclude_guest and try again. The second attempt will succeed if the CPU
supports IBS profiling.
