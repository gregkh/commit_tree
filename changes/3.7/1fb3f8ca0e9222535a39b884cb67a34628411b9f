mm: compaction: capture a suitable high-order page immediately when it is made available

While compaction is migrating pages to free up large contiguous blocks
for allocation it races with other allocation requests that may steal
these blocks or break them up.  This patch alters direct compaction to
capture a suitable free page as soon as it becomes available to reduce
this race.  It uses similar logic to split_free_page() to ensure that
watermarks are still obeyed.
