tools: Add guest trace agent as a user tool

This patch adds a user tool, "trace agent" for sending trace data of a guest to
a Host in low overhead. This agent has the following functions:
 - splice a page of ring-buffer to read_pipe without memory copying
 - splice the page from write_pipe to virtio-console without memory copying
 - write trace data to stdout by using -o option
 - controlled by start/stop orders from a Host

Changes in v2:
 - Cleanup (change fprintf() to pr_err() and an include guard)
