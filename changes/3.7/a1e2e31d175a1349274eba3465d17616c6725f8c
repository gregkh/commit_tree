ftrace: Return pt_regs to function trace callback

Return as the 4th paramater to the function tracer callback the pt_regs.

Later patches that implement regs passing for the architectures will require
having the ftrace_ops set the SAVE_REGS flag, which will tell the arch
to take the time to pass a full set of pt_regs to the ftrace_ops callback
function. If the arch does not support it then it should pass NULL.

If an arch can pass full regs, then it should define:
 ARCH_SUPPORTS_FTRACE_SAVE_REGS to 1
