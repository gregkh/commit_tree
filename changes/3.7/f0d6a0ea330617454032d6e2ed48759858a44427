Bluetooth: mgmt: Add device disconnect reason

MGMT_EV_DEVICE_DISCONNECTED will now expose the disconnection reason to
userland, distinguishing four possible values:

	0x00	Reason not known or unspecified
	0x01	Connection timeout
	0x02	Connection terminated by local host
	0x03	Connection terminated by remote host

Note that the local/remote distinction just determines which side
terminated the low-level connection, regardless of the disconnection of
the higher-level profiles.

This can sometimes be misleading and thus must be used with care. For
example, some hardware combinations would report a locally initiated
disconnection even if the user turned Bluetooth off in the remote side.
