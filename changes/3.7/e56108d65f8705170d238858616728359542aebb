md/raid5: be careful not to resize_stripes too big.

When a RAID5 is reshaping, conf->raid_disks is increased
before mddev->delta_disks becomes zero.
This can result in check_reshape calling resize_stripes with a
number that is too large.  This particularly happens
when md_check_recovery calls ->check_reshape().

If we use ->previous_raid_disks, we don't risk this.
