dm: fix deadlock with request based dm and queue request_fn recursion

Request based dm attempts to re-run the request queue off the
request completion path. If used with a driver that potentially does
end_io from its request_fn, we could deadlock trying to recurse
back into request dispatch. Fix this by punting the request queue
run to kblockd.

Tested to fix a quickly reproducible deadlock in such a scenario.
