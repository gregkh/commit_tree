Thermal: Introduce locking for cdev.thermal_instances list.

we need to go over all the thermal_instance list of a cooling device
to decide which cooling state to put the cooling device to.

But at this time, as a cooling device may be referenced in multiple
thermal zones, we need to lock the list first in case
another thermal zone is updating this cooling device.
