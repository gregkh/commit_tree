powerpc/85xx: add HOTPLUG_CPU support

Add support to disable and re-enable individual cores at runtime on
MPC85xx/QorIQ SMP machines. Currently support e500v1/e500v2 core.

MPC85xx machines use ePAPR spin-table in boot page for CPU kick-off.  This
patch uses the boot page from bootloader to boot core at runtime.  It
supports 32-bit and 36-bit physical address.
