arm64: Floating point and SIMD

This patch adds support for FP/ASIMD register bank saving and restoring
during context switch and FP exception handling to generate SIGFPE.
There are 32 128-bit registers and the context switching is currently
done non-lazily. Benchmarks on real hardware are required before
implementing lazy FP state saving/restoring.
