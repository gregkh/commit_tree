staging: comedi: drivers: use comedi_fc.h cmdtest helpers

Use the cfc_check_trigger_src() helper for Step 1 in all the
driver cmdtest functions.

Use the cfc_check_trigger_is_unique() helper for Step 2 in all
the driver cmdtest functions. Note that single source triggers
do not need to be checked, they are already unique if they pass
Step 1.

For aesthetic reasons, change the comments in the cmdtest
functions for steps 1 and 2 so that they are all the same.
