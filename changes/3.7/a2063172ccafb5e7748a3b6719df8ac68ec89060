HID: hid-lg4ff: Set absolute axes parametes on DFP

The lg4ff driver doesn't fill the "input_absinfo" struct so it is left
with default values. Applications with rely on information in this struct
therefore do not work correctly with the wheel.

Other Logitech wheels probably need this fix too, but again I do not have
enough information to write it.
