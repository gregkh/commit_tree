drm: consistently name interlaced modes

At the moment, there is an inconsistency in the way modes are named.
Modes with timings parsed from the EDID information will call
drm_mode_set_name(), which will name the mode using this form:

	<horizontal-res>x<vertical-res><interlace-char>

eg, 1920x1080i for an interlaced mode, or 1920x1080 for a progressive
mode.

However, timings parsed using the tables in drm_edid_modes.h do not
have the 'i' suffix.  You are left to deduce that they're interlaced
from xrandr's output by the lower vertical refresh frequencies.

This patch changes the interlaced mode names in drm_edid_modes.h to
follow the style set by drm_mode_set_name(), which makes it clear
in xrandr which modes are interlaced and which are not (as xrandr
groups the refresh rates on a line according to the name field.)
