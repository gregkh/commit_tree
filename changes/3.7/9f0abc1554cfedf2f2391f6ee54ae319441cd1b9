tcm_vhost: Convert I/O path to use target_submit_cmd_map_sgls

This patch converts tcm_vhost to use target_submit_cmd_map_sgls() for
I/O submission and mapping of pre-allocated SGL memory from incoming
virtio-scsi SGL memory -> se_cmd descriptors.

This includes removing the original open-coded fabric uses of target
core callers to support transport_generic_map_mem_to_cmd() between
target_setup_cmd_from_cdb() and transport_handle_cdb_direct() logic.

It also includes adding a handful of new tcm_vhost_cmnd member +
assignments in vhost_scsi_allocate_cmd() used from cmwq process
context I/O submission within tcm_vhost_submission_work()

(v2: Use renamed target_submit_cmd_map_sgls)
