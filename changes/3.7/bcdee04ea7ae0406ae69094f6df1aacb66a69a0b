MISC: hpilo, remove pci_disable_device

pci_disable_device(pdev) used to be in pci remove function. But this
PCI device has two functions with interrupt lines connected to a
single pin. The other one is a USB host controller. So when we disable
the PIN there e.g. by rmmod hpilo, the controller stops working. It is
because the interrupt link is disabled in ACPI since it is not
refcounted yet. See acpi_pci_link_free_irq called from
acpi_pci_irq_disable.

It is not the best solution whatsoever, but as a workaround until the
ACPI irq link refcounting is sorted out this should fix the reported
errors.
