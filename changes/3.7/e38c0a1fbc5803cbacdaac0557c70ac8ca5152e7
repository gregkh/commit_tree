of/address: Handle #address-cells > 2 specially

When a bus specifies #address-cells > 2, of_bus_default_map() now
assumes that the mapping isn't for a physical address but rather an
identifier that needs to match exactly.

This is required by bindings that use multiple cells to translate a
resource to the parent bus (device index, type, ...).
