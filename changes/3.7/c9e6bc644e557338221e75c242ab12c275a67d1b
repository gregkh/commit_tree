net: add gro_cells infrastructure

This adds a new include file (include/net/gro_cells.h), to bring GRO
(Generic Receive Offload) capability to tunnels, in a modular way.

Because tunnels receive path is lockless, and GRO adds a serialization
using a napi_struct, I chose to add an array of up to
DEFAULT_MAX_NUM_RSS_QUEUES cells, so that multi queue devices wont be
slowed down because of GRO layer.

skb_get_rx_queue() is used as selector.

In the future, we might add optional fanout capabilities, using rxhash
for example.

With help from Ben Hutchings who reminded me
netif_get_num_default_rss_queues() function.
