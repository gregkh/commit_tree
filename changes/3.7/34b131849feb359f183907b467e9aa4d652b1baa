rbd: add an rbd features field

Record the features values for each rbd image and each of its
snapshots.  This is really something that only becomes meaningful
for version 2 images, so this is just putting in place code
that will form common infrastructure.

It may be useful to expand the sysfs entries--and therefore the
information we maintain--for the image and for each snapshot.
But I'm going to hold off doing that until we start making
active use of the feature bits.
