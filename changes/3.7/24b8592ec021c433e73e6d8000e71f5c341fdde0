kgdboc: Accept either kbd or kdb to activate the vga + keyboard kdb shell

It is a common enough mistake for people to specify "kdb" when they
meant to type "kbd" that the kgdboc can just accept both since they
both mean the same thing anyway.  Specifically it is for the case
where you want kdb to be active on your graphics console + keyboard
(where kbd was the original abbreviation for keyboard).

With this change kgdboc will now accept either to mean the same thing:
   kgdboc=kbd
   kgdboc=kdb
