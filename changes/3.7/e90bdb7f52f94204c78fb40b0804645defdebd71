memory-hotplug: update memory block's state and notify userspace

remove_memory() will be called when hot removing a memory device.  But
even if offlining memory, we cannot notice it.  So the patch updates the
memory block's state and sends notification to userspace.

Additionally, the memory device may contain more than one memory block.
If the memory block has been offlined, __offline_pages() will fail.  So we
should try to offline one memory block at a time.

Thus remove_memory() also check each memory block's state.  So there is no
need to check the memory block's state before calling remove_memory().
