xen/mmu: For 64-bit do not call xen_map_identity_early

B/c we do not need it. During the startup the Xen provides
us with all the initial memory mapped that we need to function.

The initial memory mapped is up to the bootstack, which means
we can reference using __ka up to 4.f):

(from xen/interface/xen.h):

 4. This the order of bootstrap elements in the initial virtual region:
   a. relocated kernel image
   b. initial ram disk              [mod_start, mod_len]
   c. list of allocated page frames [mfn_list, nr_pages]
   d. start_info_t structure        [register ESI (x86)]
   e. bootstrap page tables         [pt_base, CR3 (x86)]
   f. bootstrap stack               [register ESP (x86)]

(initial ram disk may be ommitted).
