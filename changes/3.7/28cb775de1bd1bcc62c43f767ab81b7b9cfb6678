rbd: return earlier in rbd_header_from_disk()

The only caller of rbd_header_from_disk() is rbd_read_header().
It passes as allocated_snaps the number of snapshots it will
have received from the server for the snapshot context that
rbd_header_from_disk() is to interpret.  The first time through
it provides 0--mainly to extract the number of snapshots from
the snapshot context header--so that it can allocate an
appropriately-sized buffer to receive the entire snapshot
context from the server in a second request.

rbd_header_from_disk() will not fill in the array of snapshot ids
unless the number in the snapshot matches the number the caller
had allocated.

This patch adjusts that logic a little further to be more efficient.
rbd_read_header() doesn't even examine the snapshot context unless
the snapshot count (stored in header->total_snaps) matches the
number of snapshots allocated.  So rbd_header_from_disk() doesn't
need to allocate or fill in the snapshot context field at all in
that case.
