ipv4: Always invalidate or update the route on pmtu events

Some protocols, like IPsec still cache routes. So we need to invalidate
the old route on pmtu events to avoid the reuse of stale routes.
We also need to update the mtu and expire time of the route if we already
use a nh exception route, otherwise we ignore newly learned pmtu values
after the first expiration.

With this patch we always invalidate or update the route on pmtu events.
