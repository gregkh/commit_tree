drm/i915: move common code to intel_dp_set_link_train

We have some common code that we always run before calling
intel_dp_set_link_train. This common code sets the correct training
patterns to the DP variable. If we add more calls to
intel_dp_set_link_train, we'll also have to duplicate this common
code. So instead of repeating this code whenever we call
intel_dp_set_link_train, we move the code to inside the function: now
we check which training pattern we're going to set and then we set the
DP register according to it.

One of the side-effects of this change is that now we never forget to
mask the training pattern bits before changing them. It looks like
this was working before because we were first masking the bits, then
writing 00, 01 and then 11.

This patch also enables us to use the intel_dp_set_link_train function
when disabling link training: in this case we need to avoid writing
the DP_TRAINING_LANE*_SET AUX commands.

As a bonus, the big intel_dp_{start,complete}_link_train functions
will get smaller and a little bit easier to read.

Version 2 changes:
 - Rewrite commit message.
 - Also clear the training pattern bits before changing them.
