FRV: Fix VLIW packing constraint violation in entry.S

Fix VLIW packing constraint violation in entry.S:

  arch/frv/kernel/entry.S: Assembler messages:
  arch/frv/kernel/entry.S:871: Error: VLIW packing constraint violation

When packing CALLL with OR, CALLL must go in the first slot.  The
instructions are executed simultaneously, so it doesn't matter which way
round they're packed from that point of view.
