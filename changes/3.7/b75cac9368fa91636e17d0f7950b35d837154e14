workqueue: correct req_cpu in trace_workqueue_queue_work()

When we do tracing workqueue_queue_work(), it records requested cpu.
But, if !(@wq->flag & WQ_UNBOUND) and @cpu is WORK_CPU_UNBOUND,
requested cpu is changed as local cpu.
In case of @wq->flag & WQ_UNBOUND, above change is not occured,
therefore it is reasonable to correct it.

Use temporary local variable for storing requested cpu.
