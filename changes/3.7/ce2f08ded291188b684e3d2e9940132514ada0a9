serial: omap: fix DeviceTree boot

OMAP Architecture code, passes a few function
pointers for UART driver to use in order to
properly implement Power Management and Wakeup
capabilities.

The problem is that those function pointers,
which are passed (ab)using platform_data on
non-DT kernels, can't be passed down to drivers
through DT.

commit e5b57c0 (serial: omap: define helpers
for pdata function pointers) failed to take DT
kernels into consideration and caused a regression
to DT kernel boot.

Fix that by (re-)adding a check for valid pdata
pointer together with valid pdata->$FUNCTION
pointer.
