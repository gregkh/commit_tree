slub: use free_page instead of put_page for freeing kmalloc allocation

When freeing objects, the slub allocator will most of the time free
empty pages by calling __free_pages(). But high-order kmalloc will be
diposed by means of put_page() instead. It makes no sense to call
put_page() in kernel pages that are provided by the object allocators,
so we shouldn't be doing this ourselves. Aside from the consistency
change, we don't change the flow too much. put_page()'s would call its
dtor function, which is __free_pages. We also already do all of the
Compound page tests ourselves, and the Mlock test we lose don't really
matter.
