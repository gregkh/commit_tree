NFSv4: don't check MAY_WRITE access bit in OPEN

Don't check MAY_WRITE as a newly created file may not have write mode bits,
but POSIX allows the creating process to write regardless.
This is ok because NFSv4 OPEN ops handle write permissions correctly -
the ACCESS in the OPEN compound is to differentiate READ v EXEC permissions.

Fixes a regression due to commit 6168f62c (NFSv4: Add ACCESS operation to
OPEN compound)
