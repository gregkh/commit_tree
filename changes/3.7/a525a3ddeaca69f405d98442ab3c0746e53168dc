driver core: free devres in device_release

device_del can happen anytime, so once it happens,
the devres of the device will be freed inside device_del, but
drivers can't know it has been deleted and may still add
resources into the device, so memory leak is caused.

This patch moves the devres_release_all to fix the problem.
