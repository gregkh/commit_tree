uprobes/x86: Fix arch_uprobe_disable_step() && UTASK_SSTEP_TRAPPED interaction

arch_uprobe_disable_step() should also take UTASK_SSTEP_TRAPPED into
account. In this case the probed insn was not executed, we need to
clear X86_EFLAGS_TF if it was set by us and that is all.

Again, this code will look more clean when we move it into
arch_uprobe_post_xol() and arch_uprobe_abort_xol().
