alarmtimer: Use hrtimer per-alarm instead of per-base

Arve Hjønnevåg reported numerous crashes from the
"BUG_ON(timer->state != HRTIMER_STATE_CALLBACK)" check
in __run_hrtimer after it called alarmtimer_fired.

It ends up the alarmtimer code was not properly handling
possible failures of hrtimer_try_to_cancel, and because
these faulres occur when the underlying base hrtimer is
being run, this limits the ability to properly handle
modifications to any alarmtimers on that base.

Because much of the logic duplicates the hrtimer logic,
it seems that we might as well have a per-alarmtimer
hrtimer, and avoid the extra complextity of trying to
multiplex many alarmtimers off of one hrtimer.

Thus this patch moves the hrtimer to the alarm structure
and simplifies the management logic.

v2:
* Includes a fix for double alarm_start calls found by
