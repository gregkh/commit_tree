x86-64: Fix page table accounting

Commit 20167d3421a089a1bf1bd680b150dc69c9506810 ("x86-64: Fix
accounting in kernel_physical_mapping_init()") went a little too
far by entirely removing the counting of pre-populated page
tables: this should be done at boot time (to cover the page
tables set up in early boot code), but shouldn't be done during
memory hot add.

Hence, re-add the removed increments of "pages", but make them
and the one in phys_pte_init() conditional upon !after_bootmem.
