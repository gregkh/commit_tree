xen/arm: hypercalls

Use r12 to pass the hypercall number to the hypervisor.

We need a register to pass the hypercall number because we might not
know it at compile time and HVC only takes an immediate argument.

Among the available registers r12 seems to be the best choice because it
is defined as "intra-procedure call scratch register".

Use the ISS to pass an hypervisor specific tag.


Changes in v2:
- define an HYPERCALL macro for 5 arguments hypercall wrappers, even if
at the moment is unused;
- use ldm instead of pop;
- fix up comments.
