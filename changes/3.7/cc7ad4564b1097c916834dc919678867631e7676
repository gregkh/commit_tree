sh: MTU2: Introduce clock events suspend/resume routines

Introduce suspend/resume routines for SH MTU2 clock event devices
such that if those devices belong to a PM domain, the generic PM
domains framework will be notified that the given domain may be
turned off (during system suspend) or that it has to be turned on
(during system resume).
