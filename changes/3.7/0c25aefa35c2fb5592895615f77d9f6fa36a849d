i2c: mpc: Wait for STOP to hit the bus

mpc_i2c_stop() only initiates STOP but does not wait for it to
hit the I2C bus. This is a problem when using I2C devices which
uses fairly long clock stretching just before STOP if you also
have an i2c-mux which may switch to another bus before STOP has
been processed.
