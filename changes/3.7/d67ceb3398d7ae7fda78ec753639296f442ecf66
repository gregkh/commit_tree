[media] Support for Asus MyCinema U3100Mini Plus

This is initial support for the Asus MyCinema U3100Mini Plus. The driver
in its current form gets detected and loads properly.
Scanning using dvbscan works without problems, Locking onto a channel
using tzap also works fine. Only playback using tzap -r + mplayer was
tested and was fully functional.
It uses the af9035 USB Bridge chip, with an af9033 demodulator. The tuner
used is the FCI FC2580.
