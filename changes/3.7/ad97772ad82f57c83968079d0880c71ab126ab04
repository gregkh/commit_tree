ftrace: Add selftest to test function save-regs support

Add selftests to test the save-regs functionality of ftrace.

If the arch supports saving regs, then it will make sure that regs is
at least not NULL in the callback.

If the arch does not support saving regs, it makes sure that the
registering of the ftrace_ops that requests saving regs fails.
It then tests the registering of the ftrace_ops succeeds if the
'IF_SUPPORTED' flag is set. Then it makes sure that the regs passed to
the function is NULL.
