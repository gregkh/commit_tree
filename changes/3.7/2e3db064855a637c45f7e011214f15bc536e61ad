usb: dwc3: ep0: drop XferNotReady(DATA) support

Due to the late Silicon limitation found, we are
now pre-starting DATA phase's TRBs. If, still, we
get XferNotReady(DATA) we will ignore it unless
we're getting it for the wrong direction.

In that case we must keep the error case handling
plus add a ENDTRANSFER command to forcefully end
the Data TRB we started previously, then continue
to SetStall and so on.
