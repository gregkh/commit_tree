drm/i915: Remove assertion over write domain after i915_gem_object_sync()

As we move to lazily clearing the GPU write domain only when the buffer
becomes inactive, this leaves a window of opportunity for
i915_gem_object_pin_to_display_plane() to detect a seemingly
inconsistent value. This function is special as it tries to pipeline the
operation to avoid the stall and so may not retires the buffer and we
may not get the opportunity to clear the write domain. However, we know
all is good, so drop the assertion.
