firmware loader: let caching firmware piggyback on loading firmware

After starting caching firmware, there is still some time left
before devices are suspended, during the period, request_firmware
or its nowait version may still be triggered by the below situations
to load firmware images which can't be cached during suspend/resume
cycle.

	- new devices added
	- driver bind
	- or device open kind of things

This patch utilizes the piggyback trick to cache firmware for
this kind of situation: just increase the firmware buf's reference
count and add the fw name entry into cache entry list after starting
caching firmware and before syscore_suspend() is called.
