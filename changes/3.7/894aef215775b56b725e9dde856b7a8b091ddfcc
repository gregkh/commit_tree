UBI: dont call ubi_self_check_all_ff() in __wl_get_peb()

As ubi_self_check_all_ff() might sleep we are not allowed
to call it from atomic context.
For now we call it only from ubi_wl_get_peb().
There are some code paths where it would also make sense,
but these paths are currently atomic and only enabled
when fastmap is used.
