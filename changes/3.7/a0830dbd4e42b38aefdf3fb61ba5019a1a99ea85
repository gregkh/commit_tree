ALSA: Add a reference counter to card instance

For more strict protection for wild disconnections, a refcount is
introduced to the card instance, and let it up/down when an object is
referred via snd_lookup_*() in the open ops.

The free-after-last-close check is also changed to check this refcount
instead of the empty list, too.
