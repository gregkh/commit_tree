xen: allow privcmd for HVM guests

This patch removes the "return -ENOSYS" for auto_translated_physmap
guests from privcmd_mmap, thus it allows ARM guests to issue privcmd
mmap calls. However privcmd mmap calls are still going to fail for HVM
and hybrid guests on x86 because the xen_remap_domain_mfn_range
implementation is currently PV only.

Changes in v2:

- better commit message;
- return -EINVAL from xen_remap_domain_mfn_range if
  auto_translated_physmap.
