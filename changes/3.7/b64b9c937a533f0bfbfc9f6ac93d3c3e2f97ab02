uprobes/x86: Only rep+nop can be emulated correctly

__skip_sstep() correctly detects the "nontrivial" nop insns,
but since it doesn't update regs->ip we can not really skip
"0x0f 0x1f | 0x0f 0x19 | 0x87 0xc0", the probed application
is killed by SIGILL'ed handle_swbp().

Remove these additional checks. If we want to implement this
correctly we need to know the full insn length to update ->ip.

rep* + nop is fine even without updating ->ip.
