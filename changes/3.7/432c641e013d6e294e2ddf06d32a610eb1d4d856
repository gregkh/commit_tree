ALSA: hda - Fix D3 clock stop check for codecs with own set_power_state op

When a codec provides its own set_power_state op, the D3-clock-stop
isn't checked correctly.  And the recent changes for repeating the
state-setting operation isn't applied to such a codec, too.

This patch fixes these issues by moving the call of codec's own op to
the place where the generic power-set operation is done, and move the
power-state synchronization code out of
snd_hda_set_power_state_to_all() so that it can be called always at
the end of power-up/down sequence, and updates the D3 clock-stop flag
properly.
