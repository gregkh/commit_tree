block: Implement support for WRITE SAME

The WRITE SAME command supported on some SCSI devices allows the same
block to be efficiently replicated throughout a block range. Only a
single logical block is transferred from the host and the storage device
writes the same data to all blocks described by the I/O.

This patch implements support for WRITE SAME in the block layer. The
blkdev_issue_write_same() function can be used by filesystems and block
drivers to replicate a buffer across a block range. This can be used to
efficiently initialize software RAID devices, etc.
