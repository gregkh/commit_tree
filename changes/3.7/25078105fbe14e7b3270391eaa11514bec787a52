CIFS: Fix cache coherency for read oplock case

When we have a file opened with read oplock and we are writing a data
to this file, we need to store the data in the cache and then send to
the server to ensure that the next read operation will get a coherent
data.

Also mark it as CONFIG_CIFS_SMB2 because it's more suitable for SMB2
code but can fix some CIFS problems too (when server delays sending
an oplock break after a write request). We can drop this ifdefs
dependence in future.
