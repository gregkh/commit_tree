regulator: using kfree() requires including slab.h

Fixes this build error:

drivers/regulator/twl-regulator.c: In function 'twlreg_probe':
drivers/regulator/twl-regulator.c:1229:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'kfree' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

Also added string.h for kmemdup().
