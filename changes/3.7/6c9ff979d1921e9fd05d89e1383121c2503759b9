tcp: Increase timeout for SYN segments

Commit 9ad7c049 ("tcp: RFC2988bis + taking RTT sample from 3WHS for
the passive open side") changed the initRTO from 3secs to 1sec in
accordance to RFC6298 (former RFC2988bis). This reduced the time till
the last SYN retransmission packet gets sent from 93secs to 31secs.

RFC1122 is stating that the retransmission should be done for at least 3
minutes, but this seems to be quite high.

  "However, the values of R1 and R2 may be different for SYN
  and data segments.  In particular, R2 for a SYN segment MUST
  be set large enough to provide retransmission of the segment
  for at least 3 minutes.  The application can close the
  connection (i.e., give up on the open attempt) sooner, of
  course."

This patch increases the value of TCP_SYN_RETRIES to the value of 6,
providing a retransmission window of 63secs.

The comments for SYN and SYNACK retries have also been updated to
describe the current settings. The same goes for the documentation file
"Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt".
