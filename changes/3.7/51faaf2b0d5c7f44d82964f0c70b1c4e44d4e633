Revert "xen/x86: Workaround 64-bit hypervisor and 32-bit initial domain." and "xen/x86: Use memblock_reserve for sensitive areas."

This reverts commit 806c312e50f122c47913145cf884f53dd09d9199 and
commit 59b294403e9814e7c1154043567f0d71bac7a511.

And also documents setup.c and why we want to do it that way, which
is that we tried to make the the memblock_reserve more selective so
that it would be clear what region is reserved. Sadly we ran
in the problem wherein on a 64-bit hypervisor with a 32-bit
initial domain, the pt_base has the cr3 value which is not
neccessarily where the pagetable starts! As Jan put it: "
Actually, the adjustment turns out to be correct: The page
tables for a 32-on-64 dom0 get allocated in the order "first L1",
"first L2", "first L3", so the offset to the page table base is
indeed 2. When reading xen/include/public/xen.h's comment
very strictly, this is not a violation (since there nothing is said
that the first thing in the page table space is pointed to by
pt_base; I admit that this seems to be implied though, namely
do I think that it is implied that the page table space is the
range [pt_base, pt_base + nt_pt_frames), whereas that
range here indeed is [pt_base - 2, pt_base - 2 + nt_pt_frames),
which - without a priori knowledge - the kernel would have
difficulty to figure out)." - so lets just fall back to the
easy way and reserve the whole region.
