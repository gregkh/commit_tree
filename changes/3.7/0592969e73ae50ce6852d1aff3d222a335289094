hv: fail the probing immediately when we are not in hyperv platform

We wait for about 5 seconds for the success of the hyperv registration even if
we were not in hyperv platform. This is suboptimal, so the patch check the cpuid
in the beginning of hv_acpi_init() instead of in vmbus_bus_init() to fail the
probing immediately.
