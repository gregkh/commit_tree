clk: remove inline usage from clk-provider.h

Users of GCC 4.7 have reported compiler errors due to having inline
applied to function declarations in clk-provider.h.  The definitions
exist in drivers/clk/clk.c.  An example error:

In file included from arch/arm/mach-omap2/clockdomain.c:25:0:
arch/arm/mach-omap2/clockdomain.c: In function ‘clkdm_clk_disable’:
include/linux/clk-provider.h:338:12: error: inlining failed in call to always_inline ‘__clk_get_enable_count’: function body not available
arch/arm/mach-omap2/clockdomain.c:1001:28: error: called from here
make[1]: *** [arch/arm/mach-omap2/clockdomain.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/arm/mach-omap2] Error 2

This patch removes the use of inline from include/linux/clk-provider.h
but keeps the function definitions in drivers/clk/clk.c as inlined since
they are one-liners.
