x86-32: Unbreak booting on some 486 clones

There appear to have been some 486 clones, including the "enhanced"
version of Am486, which have CPUID but not CR4.  These 486 clones had
only the FPU flag, if any, unlike the Intel 486s with CPUID, which
also had VME and therefore needed CR4.

Therefore, look at the basic CPUID flags and require at least one bit
other than bit 0 before we modify CR4.

Thanks to Christian Ludloff of sandpile.org for confirming this as a
problem.
