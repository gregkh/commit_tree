btrfs: Kill some bi_idx references

For immutable bio vecs, I've been auditing and removing bi_idx
references. These were harmless, but removing them will make auditing
easier.

scrub_bio_end_io_worker() was open coding a bio_reset() - but this
doesn't appear to have been needed for anything as right after it does a
bio_put(), and perusing the code it doesn't appear anything else was
holding a reference to the bio.

The other use end_bio_extent_readpage() was just for a pr_debug() -
changed it to something that might be a bit more useful.
