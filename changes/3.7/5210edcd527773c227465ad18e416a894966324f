MIPS: Make __{,n,u}delay declarations match definitions and generic delay.h

At some recent point arch/mips/include/asm/delay.h has started being
included into csrc-octeon.c where the __?delay() functions are defined.
This causes a compile failure due to conflicting declarations and
definitions of the functions.

It turns out that the generic definitions in arch/mips/lib/delay.c also
conflict.

Proposed fix: Declare the functions to take unsigned long parameters
just like asm-generic (and x86) does.  Update __delay to agree
(__ndelay and __udelay need no change).

Bonus: Get rid of 'inline' from __delay() definition, as it is globally
visible, and the compiler should be making this decision itself (it does
in fact inline the function without being told to).
