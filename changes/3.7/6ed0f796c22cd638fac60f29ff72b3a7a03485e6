drm/i915: use staged outuput config in tv->mode_fixup

The "is this encoder cloned" check will be reused by the lvds encoder,
hence exract it.

v2: Be a bit more careful about that we need to check the new, staged
ouput configuration in the check_non_cloned helper ...

v3: Kill the double negation with s/!non_cloned/is_cloned/, suggested
by Jesse Barnes.
