workqueue: WORKER_REBIND is no longer necessary for busy rebinding

Because the old unbind/rebinding implementation wasn't atomic w.r.t.
GCWQ_DISASSOCIATED manipulation which is protected by
global_cwq->lock, we had to use two flags, WORKER_UNBOUND and
WORKER_REBIND, to avoid incorrectly losing all NOT_RUNNING bits with
back-to-back CPU hotplug operations; otherwise, completion of
rebinding while another unbinding is in progress could clear UNBIND
prematurely.

Now that both unbind/rebinding are atomic w.r.t. GCWQ_DISASSOCIATED,
there's no need to use two flags.  Just one is enough.  Don't use
WORKER_REBIND for busy rebinding.
