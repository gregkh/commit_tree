KVM: s390: Add implementation-specific trace events

Introduce a new trace system, kvm-s390, for some kvm/s390 specific
trace points:

- injection of interrupts
- delivery of interrupts to the guest
- creation/destruction of kvm machines and vcpus
- stop actions for vcpus
- reset requests for userspace
