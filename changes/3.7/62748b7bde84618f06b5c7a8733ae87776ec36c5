ixgbe: Rewrite code related to configuring IFCS bit in Tx descriptor

This change updates the code related to configuring the transmit frame
checksum.  Specifically I have updated the code so that we can only skip
inserting the checksum in the case that we are not performing some other
offload that will modify the frame data.
