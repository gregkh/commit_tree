ARM: dt: tegra: harmony: add regulators

Harmony uses a TPS6586x regulator. Instantiate this, and hook up a
couple of fixed GPIO-controlled regulators too.

Based on Ventana regulator patch by Stephen Warren <swarren@nvidia.com>
and converted to Harmony.

swarren made the following changes:
* Added ldo0 regulator configuration to device tree, and updated
  board-harmony-pcie.c for the new regulator name.
* Fixed vdd_1v05's voltage from 10.5V to 1.05V.
* Modified board-harmony-pcie.c to obtain the en_vdd_1v05 GPIO number at
  run-time from device tree instead of hard-coding it.
* Removed board-harmony{-power.c,.h} now that they're unused.
* Disabled vdd_1v05 regulator; the code in board-harmony-pcie.c hijacks
  this GPIO for now. This will be fixed when the PCIe driver is re-
  written as a driver. The code can't regulator_get("vdd_1v05") right
  now, because the vdd_1v05 regulator's probe gets deferred due to its
  supply being the PMIC, which gets probed after the regulator the first
  time around, and this dependency is only resolved by repeated probing,
  which happens when deferred_probe_initcall() is called, which happens
  in a late initcall, whose runtime order relative to harmony_pcie_init()
  is undefined, since that's also called from a late initcall.
* Removed unused harmony_pcie_initcall().
