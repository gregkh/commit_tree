NFS: callback service start function introduced

This is just a code move, which from my POW makes code looks better.
I.e. now on start we have 3 different stages:
1) Service creation.
2) Service per-net data allocation.
3) Service start.

Patch also renames goto label "out_err:" into "err_start:" to reflect new
changes.
