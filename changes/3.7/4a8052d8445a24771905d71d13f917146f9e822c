ARM: 7491/1: use generic version of identical asm headers

Inspired by the AArgh64 claim that it should be separate from ARM and one
reason was being able to use more asm-generic headers. Doing a diff of
arch/arm/include/asm and include/asm-generic there are numerous asm
headers which are functionally identical to their asm-generic counterparts.
Delete the ARM version and use the generic ones.
