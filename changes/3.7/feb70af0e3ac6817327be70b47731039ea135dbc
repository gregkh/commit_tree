PM: Do not use the syscore flag for runtime PM

The syscore device PM flag used to mark the devices (belonging to
PM domains) that should never be turned off, except for the system
core (syscore) suspend/hibernation and resume stages, need not be
accessed by the runtime PM core functions, because all of the devices
it is set for need to be marked as "irq safe" anyway and are
protected from being turned off by runtime PM by ensuring that their
usage counters are always set.

For this reason, make the syscore flag system-wide PM-specific
and simplify the code used for manipulating it, because it need not
acquire the device's power.lock any more.
