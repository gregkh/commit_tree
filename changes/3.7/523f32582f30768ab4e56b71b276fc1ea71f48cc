    rbd: simplify __rbd_init_snaps_header()

The problem is that a new rbd snapshot needs to go either after an
existing snapshot entry, or at the *end* of an rbd device's snapshot
list.  As originally coded, it is placed at the beginning.  This was
based on the assumption the list would be empty (so it wouldn't
matter), but in fact if multiple new snapshots are added to an empty
list in one shot the list will be non-empty after the first one is
added.
