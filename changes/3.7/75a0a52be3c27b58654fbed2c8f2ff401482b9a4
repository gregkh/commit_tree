virtio: introduce an API to set affinity for a virtqueue

Sometimes, virtio device need to configure irq affinity hint to maximize the
performance. Instead of just exposing the irq of a virtqueue, this patch
introduce an API to set the affinity for a virtqueue.

The api is best-effort, the affinity hint may not be set as expected due to
platform support, irq sharing or irq type. Currently, only pci method were
implemented and we set the affinity according to:

- if device uses INTX, we just ignore the request
- if device has per vq vector, we force the affinity hint
- if the virtqueues share MSI, make the affinity OR over all affinities
