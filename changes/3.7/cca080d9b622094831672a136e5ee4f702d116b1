userns: Convert audit to work with user namespaces enabled

- Explicitly format uids gids in audit messges in the initial user
  namespace. This is safe because auditd is restrected to be in
  the initial user namespace.

- Convert audit_sig_uid into a kuid_t.

- Enable building the audit code and user namespaces at the same time.

The net result is that the audit subsystem now uses kuid_t and kgid_t whenever
possible making it almost impossible to confuse a raw uid_t with a kuid_t
preventing bugs.
