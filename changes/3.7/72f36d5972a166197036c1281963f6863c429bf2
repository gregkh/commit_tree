md: refine reporting of resync/reshape delays.

If 'resync_max' is set to 0 (as is often done when starting a
reshape, so the mdadm can remain in control during a sensitive
period), and if the reshape request is initially delayed because
another array using the same array is resyncing or reshaping etc,
when user-space cannot easily tell when the delay changes from being
due to a conflicting reshape, to being due to resync_max = 0.

So introduce a new state: (curr_resync == 3) to reflect this, make
sure it is visible both via /proc/mdstat and via the "sync_completed"
sysfs attribute, and ensure that the event transition from one delay
state to the other is properly notified.
