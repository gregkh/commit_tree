i2c: omap: split out [XR]DR and [XR]RDY

While they do pretty much the same thing, there
are a few peculiarities. Specially WRT erratas,
it's best to split those out and re-factor the
read/write loop to another function which both
cases call.

This last part will be done on another patch.

While at that, also avoid an unncessary register
read since dev->fifo_len will always contain the
correct amount of data to be transferred.
