X.509: Fix indefinite length element skip error handling

asn1_find_indefinite_length() returns an error indicator of -1, which the
caller asn1_ber_decoder() places in a size_t (which is usually unsigned) and
then checks to see whether it is less than 0 (which it can't be).  This can
lead to the following warning:

	lib/asn1_decoder.c:320 asn1_ber_decoder()
		warn: unsigned 'len' is never less than zero.

Instead, asn1_find_indefinite_length() update the caller's idea of the data
cursor and length separately from returning the error code.
