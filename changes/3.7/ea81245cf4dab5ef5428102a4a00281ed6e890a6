powerpc/eeh: Global mutex to protect PE tree

We have missed lots of situations where the PE hierarchy tree need
protection through the EEH global mutex. The patch fixes that for
those public APIs implemented in eeh_pe.c. The only exception is
eeh_pe_restore_bars() because it calls eeh_pe_dev_traverse(), which
has been protected by the mutex.
