drm/i915: don't frob the vblank ts in finish_page_flip

Now that we correctly generate it, this hack is no longer required (and
might actually paper over a serious bug).

pageflip timestamps are sanity check in the latest version of the flip-test
in intel-gpu-tools.

v2: Also remove the gettimeofday(&now) which is no longer used.
Noticed by Mario Kleiner.
