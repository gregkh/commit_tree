module: fix out-by-one error in kallsyms

Masaki found and patched a kallsyms issue: the last symbol in a
module's symtab wasn't transferred.  This is because we manually copy
the zero'th entry (which is always empty) then copy the rest in a loop
starting at 1, though from src[0].  His fix was minimal, I prefer to
rewrite the loops in more standard form.

There are two loops: one to get the size, and one to copy.  Make these
identical: always count entry 0 and any defined symbol in an allocated
non-init section.

This bug exists since the following commit was introduced.
   module: reduce symbol table for loaded modules (v2)
