sparc: Support atomic64_dec_if_positive properly.

Sparc32 already supported it, as a consequence of using the
generic atomic64 implementation.  And the sparc64 implementation
is rather trivial.

This allows us to set ARCH_HAS_ATOMIC64_DEC_IF_POSITIVE for all
of sparc, and avoid the annoying warning from lib/atomic64_test.c
