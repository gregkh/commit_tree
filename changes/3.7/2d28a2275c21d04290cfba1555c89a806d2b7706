mm: thp: fix the pmd_clear() arguments in pmdp_get_and_clear()

The CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE implementation of pmdp_get_and_clear()
calls pmd_clear() with 3 arguments instead of 1.

This happens only for !__HAVE_ARCH_PMDP_GET_AND_CLEAR which doesn't seem
to happen because x86 defines this and it uses pmd_update.
