bonding: fix race condition in bonding_store_slaves_active

Race between bonding_store_slaves_active() and slave manipulation
 functions. The bond_for_each_slave use in bonding_store_slaves_active()
 is not protected by any synchronization mechanism.
 NULL pointer dereference is easy to reach.
 Fixed by acquiring the bond->lock for the slave walk.
