HID: Add support for Sony PS3 BD Remote Control

The Sony PS3 Blue-ray Disc Remote Control used to be supported by the
BlueZ project's user space, but the code that handled it was recently
removed as its functionality conflicted with a real HSP implementation
and the mapping was thought to be better handled in the kernel. This is
a port of the mapping logic from the fakehid driver by Marcel Holtmann
to the in-kernel HID layer.

We also add support for the Logitech Harmony Adapter for PS3, which
emulates the BD Remote.
