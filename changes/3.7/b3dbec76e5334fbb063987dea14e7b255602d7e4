rcu: Move RCU grace-period initialization into a kthread

As the first step towards allowing grace-period initialization to be
preemptible, this commit moves the RCU grace-period initialization
into its own kthread.  This is needed to keep large-system scheduling
latency at reasonable levels.

Also change raw_spin_lock_irqsave() to raw_spin_lock_irq() as suggested
by Peter Zijlstra in review comments.
