ASoC: Ux500: Move MSP pinctrl setup into the MSP driver

In the initial submission of the MSP driver msp1 and msp3's associated
pinctrl mechanism was passed back to platform code using a plat_init()
call-back routine, but it has no place in platform code. The MSP driver
should set this up for the appropriate ports. Instead we use a use_pinctrl
identifier which is passed from platform_data/Device Tree which indicates
which ports should use pinctrl.
