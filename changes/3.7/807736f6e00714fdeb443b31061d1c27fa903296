batman-adv: Split batadv_priv in sub-structures for features

The structure batadv_priv grows everytime a new feature is introduced. It gets
hard to find the parts of the struct that belongs to a specific feature. This
becomes even harder by the fact that not every feature uses a prefix in the
member name.

The variables for bridge loop avoidence, gateway handling, translation table
and visualization server are moved into separate structs that are included in
the bat_priv main struct.
