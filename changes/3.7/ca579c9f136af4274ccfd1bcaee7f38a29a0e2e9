[SCSI] zfcp: remove invalid reference to list iterator variable

If list_for_each_entry, etc complete a traversal of the list, the iterator
variable ends up pointing to an address at an offset from the list head,
and not a meaningful structure.  Thus this value should not be used after
the end of the iterator.  Replace port->adapter->scsi_host by
adapter->scsi_host.

This problem was found using Coccinelle (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/).
