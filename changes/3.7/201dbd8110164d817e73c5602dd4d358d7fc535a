ARM: shmobile: Rework adding devices to PM domains on AP4EVB

Use the function rmobile_add_devices_to_domains() introduced
previously for adding devices to PM domains during the AP4EVB
initialization instead of a series of rmobile_add_device_to_domain*()
calls.  This also causes the default device PM QoS latencies to be
used on that board in analogy with Mackerel.
