rcu: Segregate rcu_state fields to improve cache locality

The fields in the rcu_state structure that are protected by the
root rcu_node structure's ->lock can share a cache line with the
fields protected by ->onofflock.  This can result in excessive
memory contention on large systems, so this commit applies
____cacheline_internodealigned_in_smp to the ->onofflock field in
order to segregate them.
