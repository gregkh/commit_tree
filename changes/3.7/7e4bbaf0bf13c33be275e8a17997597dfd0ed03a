powerpc/eeh: Use slab to allocate eeh devices

The EEH initialization functions have been postponed until slab/slub
are ready. So we use slab/slub to allocate the memory chunks for newly
creatd EEH devices. That would save lots of memory.

The patch also does cleanup to replace "kmalloc" with "kzalloc" so
that we needn't clear the allocated memory chunk explicitly.
