mm: fix build warning for uninitialized value

do_wp_page() sets mmun_called if mmun_start and mmun_end were
initialized and, if so, may call mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end()
with these values.  This doesn't prevent gcc from emitting a build
warning though:

  mm/memory.c: In function `do_wp_page':
  mm/memory.c:2530: warning: `mmun_start' may be used uninitialized in this function
  mm/memory.c:2531: warning: `mmun_end' may be used uninitialized in this function

It's much easier to initialize the variables to impossible values and do
a simple comparison to determine if they were initialized to remove the
bool entirely.
