powerpc/powernv: I/O and memory alignment for P2P bridges

The patch implements ppc_md.pcibios_window_alignment for powernv
platform so that the resource reassignment in PCI core will be
done according to the I/O and memory alignment returned from
powernv platform. The alignments returned from powernv platform
is closely depending on the scheme for PE segmenting. Besides,
the patch isn't useful for now, but the subsequent patches will
be working based on it.
