USB: mos7840: fix port-data memory leak

Fix port-data memory leak by moving port data allocation and
deallocation to port_probe and port_remove.

Since commit 0998d0631001288 (device-core: Ensure drvdata = NULL when no
driver is bound) the port private data is no longer freed at release as
it is no longer accessible.

Note that the indentation was kept intact using a do-while(0) in order
to facilitate review. A follow-up patch will remove it.

Compile-only tested.
