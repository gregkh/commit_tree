vfio: Move PCI INTx eventfd setting earlier

We need to be ready to recieve an interrupt as soon as we call
request_irq, so our eventfd context setting needs to be moved
earlier.  Without this, an interrupt from our device or one
sharing the interrupt line can pass a NULL into eventfd_signal
and oops.
