perf tools: Fix intlist node removal

Similar to the one in :
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/8/29/27

Make sure we remove the node from the rblist before we delete the node.
The rblist__remove_node() will invoke rblist->node_delete, which  will
take care of deleting the node with the suitable function provided by
the user.
