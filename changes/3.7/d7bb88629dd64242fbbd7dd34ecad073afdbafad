powerpc/eeh: Probe mode support

While EEH module is installed, PCI devices is checked one by one
to see if it supports eeh. On different platforms, the PCI devices
are referred through different ways when the EEH module is loaded.
For example, on pSeries platform, that is done by OF node. However,
we would do that by real PCI devices (struct pci_dev) on PowerNV
platform in future. So we needs some mechanism to differentiate
those cases by classifying them to probe modes, either from OF
nodes or real PCI devices.

The patch implements the support to eeh probe mode. Also, the
EEH on pSeries has set it into EEH_PROBE_MODE_DEVTREE. That means
the probe will be done based on OF nodes on pSeries platform.

In addition, On pSeries platform, it's done by OF nodes. The patch
moves the the probe function from EEH core to platform dependent
backend and some cleanup applied.
