ALSA: hda - fix indices on boost volume on Conexant

After the recent patch "ALSA: hda - use both input paths on Conexant
auto parser" suddenly we can have more than one "Mic Boost", this
happened on Acer Aspire One 722. Therefore we must add the possibility
to put an index on this "Mic Boost" just as we do for the other
"Mic Boost" earlier in the same function.
