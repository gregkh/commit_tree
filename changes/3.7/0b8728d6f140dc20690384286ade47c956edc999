ledtrig-cpu: kill useless mutex to fix sleep in atomic context

Seeing the following every time the CPU enters or leaves idle on a
Beagleboard:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/mutex.c:269
in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, pid: 0, name: swapper/0
no locks held by swapper/0/0.

Miles Lane has reported seeing similar splats during system suspend.

The mutex in struct led_trigger_cpu appears to have no function: it
resides in a per-cpu data structure which never changes after the
trigger is registered.  So just remove it.
