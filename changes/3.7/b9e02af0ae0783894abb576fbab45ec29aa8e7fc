don't bother with call_rcu() in put_files_struct()

At that point nobody can see us anyway; everything that
looks at files_fdtable(files) is separated from the
guts of put_files_struct(files) - either since files is
current->files or because we fetched it under task_lock()
and hadn't dropped that yet, or because we'd bumped
files->count while holding task_lock()...
