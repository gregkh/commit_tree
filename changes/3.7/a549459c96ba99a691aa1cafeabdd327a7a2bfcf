ath9k: Fix rx filtering issue for older chips

We need to have the promiscuous mode enabled for older
chipsets so that the olderchips hardware does not
filters out some valid/necessary frames that need
to be sent to mac80211. Fix this by enabling promiscus
mode for all the chipsets whose macversion <= AR9160
chipsets. This should fix

shafi: made the fix generic by having the frame filtering
disabled for chipsets older than AR9280.
