ixgbe: Make pull tail function separate from rest of cleanup_headers

This change creates a separate function for functionality similar to
pskb_pull_tail.  The main motivation for moving it to a separate function
is so that later I can just skip this function in the case where we have
already copied the buffer into skb->head.
