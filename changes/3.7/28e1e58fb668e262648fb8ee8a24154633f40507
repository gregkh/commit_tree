powerpc/kprobes: Rename opcode_t in probes.h to ppc_opcode_t

commit: 8b7b80b9ebb46dd88fbb94e918297295cf312b59
[24/29] powerpc: Uprobes port to powerpc

Caused a clash with the fore200e driver:

In file included from drivers/atm/fore200e.c:70:0:
drivers/atm/fore200e.h:263:3: error: redefinition of typedef 'opcode_t' with different type
arch/powerpc/include/asm/probes.h:25:13: note: previous declaration of 'opcode_t' was here

Fix the namespace clash by making opcode_t in probes.h to ppc_opcode_t.
