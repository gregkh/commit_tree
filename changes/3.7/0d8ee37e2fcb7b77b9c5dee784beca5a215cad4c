rcu: Disallow callback registry on offline CPUs

Posting a callback after the CPU_DEAD notifier effectively leaks
that callback unless/until that CPU comes back online.  Silence is
unhelpful when attempting to track down such leaks, so this commit emits
a WARN_ON_ONCE() and unconditionally leaks the callback when an offline
CPU attempts to register a callback.  The rdp->nxttail[RCU_NEXT_TAIL] is
set to NULL in the CPU_DEAD notifier and restored in the CPU_UP_PREPARE
notifier, allowing _call_rcu() to determine exactly when posting callbacks
is illegal.
