GFS2: Add structure to contain rgrp, bitmap, offset tuple

This patch introduces a new structure, gfs2_rbm, which is a
tuple of a resource group, a bitmap within the resource group
and an offset within that bitmap. This is designed to make
manipulating these sets of variables easier. There is also a
new helper function which converts this representation back
to a disk block address.

In addition, the rbtree nodes which are used for the reservations
were not being correctly initialised, which is now fixed. Also,
the tracing was not passing through the inode where it should
have been. That is mostly fixed aside from one corner case. This
needs to be revisited since there can also be a NULL rgrp in
some cases which results in the device being incorrect in the
trace.

This is intended to be the first step towards cleaning up some
of the allocation code, and some further bug fixes.
