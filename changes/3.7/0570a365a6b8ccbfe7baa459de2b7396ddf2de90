x86, boot: Remove obsolete and unused constant RAMDISK

The named constant RAMDISK is unused. It used to set the (obsolete)
kernel boot header field ram_size, but its usage for that purpose got
dropped in commit 5e47c478b0b69bc9bc3ba544e4b1ca3268f98fef ("x86: remove
zImage support"). Now remove this constant too.
