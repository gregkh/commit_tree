block: Generalized bio pool freeing

With the old code, when you allocate a bio from a bio pool you have to
implement your own destructor that knows how to find the bio pool the
bio was originally allocated from.

This adds a new field to struct bio (bi_pool) and changes
bio_alloc_bioset() to use it. This makes various bio destructors
unnecessary, so they're then deleted.
