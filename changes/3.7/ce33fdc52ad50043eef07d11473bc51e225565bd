sparc64: Probe cpu page size support more portably.

On sun4v, interrogate the machine description.  This code is extremely
defensive in nature, and a lot of the checks can probably be removed.

On sun4u things are a lot simpler.  There are the page sizes all chips
support, and then Panther adds 32MB and 256MB pages.

Report the probed value in /proc/cpuinfo
