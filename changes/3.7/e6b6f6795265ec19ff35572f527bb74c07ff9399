perf evsel: Handle endianity in intval method

We were relying on the info in pevent, but since we have it in
perf_evsel, set up by the perf_session routine if read from a perf.data
file or by whoever creates the evsels, use it.

New 'perf test' entries will use it to parse locally generated events,
in a non perf.data centered workflow.

As well as use byteswap.h to get per arch optimized swap routines, like
other parts of perf (header, perf_evsel__parse_sample, symbol, etc)
already do.
