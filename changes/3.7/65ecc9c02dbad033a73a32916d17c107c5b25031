8250: blacklist Winbond CIR port

The legacy serial driver will detect the Winbond CIR device as a serial
port, since it looks exactly like a serial port unless you know what
it is from the PNP ID.

Here we track this port as a special PORT_8250_CIR type, preventing the
legacy serial driver from probing it.
