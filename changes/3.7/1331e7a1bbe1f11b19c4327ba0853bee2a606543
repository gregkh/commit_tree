rcu: Remove _rcu_barrier() dependency on __stop_machine()

Currently, _rcu_barrier() relies on preempt_disable() to prevent
any CPU from going offline, which in turn depends on CPU hotplug's
use of __stop_machine().

This patch therefore makes _rcu_barrier() use get_online_cpus() to
block CPU-hotplug operations.  This has the added benefit of removing
the need for _rcu_barrier() to adopt callbacks:  Because CPU-hotplug
operations are excluded, there can be no callbacks to adopt.  This
commit simplifies the code accordingly.
