clock: max77686: Add driver for Maxim 77686 32Khz crystal oscillator.

This patch supports max77686 mfd's clock driver using common clock frame work.
max77686 has 3 clock ouputs which all are generated from crystal oscillator and
SOC can enable/disable them via I2C bus. All clocks are fixed-rate clock sources
so that it doesn't supply interface for changing clock rate.
Driver uses regmap API to communicate with internal register.
