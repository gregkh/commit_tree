firmware: introduce device_cache/uncache_fw_images

This patch introduces the three helpers below:

	void device_cache_fw_images(void)
	void device_uncache_fw_images(void)
	void device_uncache_fw_images_delay(unsigned long)

so we can use device_cache_fw_images() to cache firmware for
all devices which need firmware to work, and the device driver
can get the firmware easily from kernel memory when system isn't
ready for completing requests of loading firmware.

After system is ready for completing firmware loading, driver core
will call device_uncache_fw_images() or its delay version to free
the cached firmware.

The above helpers will be used to cache device firmware during
system suspend/resume cycle in the following patches.
