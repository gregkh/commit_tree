staging: usbip: userspace: update man pages for v1.0.0

This brings them back up to date after:

    staging: usbip: userspace tools v1.0.0

I couldn't find a current equivalent for

  client:# usbip --port

Perhaps that functionality has been deprecated due to better logging.
It seems like libsrc/usbip_common.h's usbip_status_string is no longer
used.
