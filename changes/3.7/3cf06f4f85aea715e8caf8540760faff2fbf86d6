mtd: tests: test for multi-bit error correction

This tests ECC biterror recovery on a single NAND page. Mostly intended
to test ECC hardware and low-level NAND driver.

There are two test modes:

    0 - artificially inserting bit errors until the ECC fails
        This is the default method and fairly quick. It should
        be independent of the quality of the FLASH.

    1 - re-writing the same pattern repeatedly until the ECC fails.
        This method relies on the physics of NAND FLASH to eventually
        generate '0' bits if '1' has been written sufficient times. Depending
        on the NAND, the first bit errors will appear after 1000 or
        more writes and then will usually snowball, reaching the limits
        of the ECC quickly.

The test stops after 10000 cycles, should your FLASH be exceptionally
good and not generate bit errors before that. Try a different page
offset in that case.

Please note that neither of these tests will significantly 'use up' any FLASH
endurance. Only a maximum of two erase operations will be performed.
