i2c: omap: improve i462 errata handling

Make it not depend on ISR's local variables
in order to make it easier to re-factor the
transmit data loop.
Also since we are waiting for XUDF(Transmitter underflow) just before
writing data lets not flag the underflow.
This is anyways going to go once we write
the data.
