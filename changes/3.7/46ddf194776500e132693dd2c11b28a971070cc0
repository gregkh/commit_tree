drm/i915: Add setters for min/max frequency

Provide a standardized sysfs interface for setting min, and max
frequencies.  The code which reads the limits were lifted from the
debugfs files. As a brief explanation, the limits are similar to the CPU
p-states. We have 3 states:

RP0 - ie. max frequency
RP1 - ie. "preferred min" frequency
RPn - seriously lowest frequency

Initially Daniel asked me to clamp the writes to supported values, but
in conforming to the way the cpufreq drivers seem to work, instead
return -EINVAL (noticed by Jesse in discussion).
The values can be used by userspace wishing to control the limits of the
GPU (see the CC list for people who care).

v4: Make exceeding the soft limits return -EINVAL as well (Daniel)

v3: bug fix (Ben) -  was passing the MHz value to gen6_set_rps instead of
the step value. To fix, deal only with step values by doing the divide
at the top.

v2: add the dropped mutex_unlock in error cases (Chris)
EINVAL on both too min, or too max (Daniel)
