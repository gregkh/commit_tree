ARM: 7518/1: integrator: convert AMBA devices to device tree

This converts the AMBA (PrimeCell) devices on the Integrator/AP
and Integrator/CP over to probing from the Device Tree if the
kernel is compiled for Device Tree support.

We continue to #ifdef out all non-DT code and vice versa on
respective boot type to get a clean cut.

We need to add a bunch of auxdata (compare to the Versatile)
to handle bus names and callbacks alike.
