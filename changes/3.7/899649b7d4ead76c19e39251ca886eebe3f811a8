vfio: Fix PCI INTx disable consistency

The virq_disabled flag tracks the userspace view of INTx masking
across interrupt mode changes, but we're not consistently applying
this to the interrupt and masking handler notion of the device.
Currently if the user sets DisINTx while in MSI or MSIX mode, then
returns to INTx mode (ex. rebooting a qemu guest), the hardware has
DisINTx+, but the management of INTx thinks it's enabled, making it
impossible to actually clear DisINTx.  Fix this by updating the
handler state when INTx is re-enabled.
