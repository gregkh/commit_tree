kmemleak: use rbtree instead of prio tree

kmemleak uses a tree where each node represents an allocated memory object
in order to quickly find out what object a given address is part of.
However, the objects don't overlap, so rbtrees are a better choice than
prio tree for this use.  They are both faster and have lower memory
overhead.

Tested by booting a kernel with kmemleak enabled, loading the
kmemleak_test module, and looking for the expected messages.
