staging: comedi: adv_pci1710: remove "dummy" boardinfo entry

The legacy attach used the "dummy" boardinfo entry to allow
matching a boardinfo to a pci card based on the "name" passed
by the comedi core. This driver now uses the PCI auto config
mechanism which always matches to the PCI vendor/device ids.
