KVM: Don't update PPR on any APIC read

The current code will update the PPR on almost any APIC read; however
that's only required if we read the PPR.

kvm_update_ppr() shows up in some profiles, albeit with a low usage (~1%).
This should reduce it further (it will still be called during interrupt
processing).
