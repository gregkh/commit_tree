da9052-battery: Don't free IRQ that wasn't requested

We should decrement "i" before doing the free_irq().  If we call this
because request_threaded_irq() failed then we don't want to free the
thing which failed.  Or in the case where we get here because
power_supply_register() failed then the original codes does a read past
the end of the array.
