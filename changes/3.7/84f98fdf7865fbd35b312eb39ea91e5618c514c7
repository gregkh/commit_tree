ALSA: hda - add dock support for Thinkpad T430

I have a Lenovo ThinkPad T430 and an UltraBase Series 3 docking
station.

Without this patch, if I plug my headphones into the jack on the
computer, everything works fine. The computer speakers mute and the
audio is played in the headphones. However, if I plug into the docking
station headphone jack the computer speakers are muted but there is no
audio in the headphones.
