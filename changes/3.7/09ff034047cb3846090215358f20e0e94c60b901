[media] s5p-fimc: Remove unused platform data structure fields

alignment, fixed_phy_vdd and phy_enable fields are now unused
so removed them. The data alignment is now derived directly
from media bus pixel code, phy_enable callback has been replaced
with direct function call and fixed_phy_vdd was dropped in commit
