Btrfs: fix unprotected ->log_batch

We forget to protect ->log_batch when syncing a file, this patch fix
this problem by atomic operation. And ->log_batch is used to check
if there are parallel sync operations or not, so it is unnecessary to
reset it to 0 after the sync operation of the current log tree complete.
