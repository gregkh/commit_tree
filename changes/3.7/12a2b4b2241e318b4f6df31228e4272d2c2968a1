coredump: add support for %d=__get_dumpable() in core name

Some coredump handlers want to create a core file in a way compatible with
standard behavior.  Standard behavior with fs.suid_dumpable = 2 is to
create core file with uid=gid=0.  However, there was no way for coredump
handler to know that the process being dumped was suid'ed.

This patch adds the new %d specifier for format_corename() which simply
reports __get_dumpable(mm->flags), this is compatible with
/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable we already have.
