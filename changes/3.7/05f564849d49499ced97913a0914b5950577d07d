proc: check vma->vm_file before dereferencing

Commit 7b540d0646ce ("proc_map_files_readdir(): don't bother with
grabbing files") switched proc_map_files_readdir() to use @f_mode
directly instead of grabbing @file reference, but same time the test for
@vm_file presence was lost leading to nil dereference.  The patch brings
the test back.

The all proc_map_files feature is CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE wrapped
(which is set to 'n' by default) so the bug doesn't affect regular
kernels.

The regression is 3.7-rc1 only as far as I can tell.
