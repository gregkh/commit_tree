PM / Runtime: Allow helpers to be called by early platform drivers

Runtime PM helper functions, like pm_runtime_get_sync(), cannot be
called by early platform device drivers, because the devices' power
management locks are not initialized at that time.  This is quite
inconvenient, so modify early_platform_add_devices() to initialize
the devices power management locks as appropriate and make sure that
they won't be initialized more than once if an early platform
device is going to be used as a regular one later.
