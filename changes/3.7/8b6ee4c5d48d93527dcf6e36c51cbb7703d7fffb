perf header: Set the tracepoint names on PERF_RECORD_HEADER_TRACING_DATA

We only have access to pevent after processing that event, so set the
tracepoint names there.

Right now this isn't a problem as we're deferring resolving the
tracepoint names to when we process samples, but in the next patches we
will be doing it in advance, to avoid relookups, so do it earlier, as
soon as we process the tracing data event.
