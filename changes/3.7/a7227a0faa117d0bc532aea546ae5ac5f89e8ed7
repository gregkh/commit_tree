PM / QoS: fix wrong error-checking condition

dev_pm_qos_add_request() can return 0, 1, or a negative error code,
therefore the correct error test is "if (error < 0)." Checking just for
non-zero return code leads to erroneous setting of the req->dev pointer
to NULL, which then leads to a repeated call to
dev_pm_qos_add_ancestor_request() in st1232_ts_irq_handler(). This in turn
leads to an Oops, when the I2C host adapter is unloaded and reloaded again
because of the inconsistent state of its QoS request list.
