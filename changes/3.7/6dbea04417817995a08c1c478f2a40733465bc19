HID: Remove "default m" from HID_LOGITECH_DJ

HID_LOGITECH_DJ uses "default m", which enables it in default kernel
builds.  Since this module just enables extra, non-critical
functionality for one particular piece of hardware (specifically,
differentiating multiple wireless keyboards and mice as separate input
devices rather than treating them as one device), and the hardware works
just fine with the default USB HID support, drop the "default m".
