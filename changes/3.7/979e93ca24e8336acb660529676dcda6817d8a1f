sparc64: Add auto-loading mechanism to crypto-opcode drivers.

Just simply provide a device table containing an entry for sun4v cpus,
the capability mask checks in the drivers themselves will take care of
the rest.

This makes the bootup logs on pre-T4 cpus slightly more verbose, with
each driver indicating lack of support for the associated opcode(s).

But this isn't too much of a real problem.

I toyed with the idea of using explicit entries with compatability
fields of "SPARC-T4", "SPARC-T5", etc. but all future cpus will have
some subset of these opcodes available and this would just be one more
pointless thing to do as each new cpu is released with a new string.
