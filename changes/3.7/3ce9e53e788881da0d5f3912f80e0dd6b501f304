kbuild: Fix accidental revert in commit fe04ddf

Commit fe04ddf7c291 ("kbuild: Do not package /boot and /lib in make
tar-pkg") accidentally reverted two previous kbuild commits.  I don't
know what I was thinking.

This brings back changes made by commits 24cc7fb69a5b ("x86/kbuild:
archscripts depends on scripts_basic") and c1c1a59e37da ("firmware: fix
directory creation rule matching with make 3.80")
