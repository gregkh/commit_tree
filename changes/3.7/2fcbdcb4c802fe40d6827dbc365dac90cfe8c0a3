[SCSI] libata: export ata_port suspend/resume infrastructure for sas

Reuse ata_port_{suspend|resume}_common for sas.  This path is chosen
over adding coordination between ata-tranport and sas-transport because
libsas wants to revalidate the domain at resume-time at the host level.
It can not validate links have resumed properly until libata has had a
chance to perform its revalidation, and any sane placing of an ata_port
in the sas-transport model would delay it's resumption until after the
host.

Export the common portion of port suspend/resume (bypass pm_runtime),
and allow sas to perform these operations asynchronously (similar to the
libsas async-ata probe implmentation).  Async operation is determined by
having an external, rather than stack based, location for storing the
result of the operation.
