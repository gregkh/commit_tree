ALSA: hda - Check the power state when power_save option is changed

... by calling the newly introduced snd_hda_power_sync().

I had to reimplement a wheel for adding the trigger at changing the
parameter -- the parameter set ops is overwritten to pass the integer
parameter, then trigger the power-state sync.
