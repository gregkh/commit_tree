HID: hid-sensor-hub: Fix sensor_hub_probe error handling

Fix below issues:
1. In the case of goto err_close, hid_hw_stop(hdev) is called twice. Fix it.
2. If fails to allocate MFD device name, we also need to free all
   successfully allocated names in previous iterations.
3. In sensor_hub_remove(), Call hid_hw_close() before hid_hw_stop().
4. Adjust unnecessary change lines for hid_err.
