btrfs: move inline function code to header file

When building btrfs from kernel code, it will report:

	fs/btrfs/extent_io.h:281: warning: 'extent_buffer_page' declared inline after being called
	fs/btrfs/extent_io.h:281: warning: previous declaration of 'extent_buffer_page' was here
	fs/btrfs/extent_io.h:280: warning: 'num_extent_pages' declared inline after being called
	fs/btrfs/extent_io.h:280: warning: previous declaration of 'num_extent_pages' was here

because of the wrong declaration of inline functions.
