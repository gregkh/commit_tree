perf tools: add NO_BACKTRACE for application self-debugging

perf has support for self-debugging by defining dump_stack function.
This function uses backtrace and backtrace_symbols functions defined as
GNU extensions.

In Android, bionic does not offer support for these functions and
compilation will fail with the following error:

target  C: libperf <= tools/perf/util/util.c
tools/perf/util/util.c:4:22: fatal error: execinfo.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Add a compile-time option (NO_BACKTRACE) to enable or disable
self-debugging functionality in perf. This can also help in debugging
since it offers the possibility to turn on/off printing the backtrace.
