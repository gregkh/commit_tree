RDMA/cma: Check that retry count values are in range

The retry_count and rnr_retry_count connection parameters are both
3-bit values.  Check that the values are in range and reduce if
they're not.

This fixes a problem reported by Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com>
that resulted in the userspace rping test (part of the librdmacm
samples) failing to run over Intel IB HCAs.
