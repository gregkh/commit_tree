arm64: MMU definitions

The virtual memory layout is described in
Documentation/arm64/memory.txt. This patch adds the MMU definitions for
the 4KB and 64KB translation table configurations. The SECTION_SIZE is
2MB with 4KB page and 512MB with 64KB page configuration.

PHYS_OFFSET is calculated at run-time and stored in a variable (no
run-time code patching at this stage).

On the current implementation, both user and kernel address spaces are
512G (39-bit) each with a maximum of 256G for the RAM linear mapping.
Linux uses 3 levels of translation tables with the 4K page configuration
and 2 levels with the 64K configuration. Extending the memory space
beyond 39-bit with the 4K pages or 42-bit with 64K pages requires an
additional level of translation tables.

The SPARSEMEM configuration is global to all AArch64 platforms and
allows for 1GB sections with SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP enabled by default.
