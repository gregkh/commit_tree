ARM: ks8695: add board support for the SnapGear boards based on the KS8695

A number of boards produced by SnapGear are based on the Micrel KS8695 SoC.
Add board support to the KS8695 kernel code to support them.

The following machine type entries will need to be added back into the
mach-types file with these in mainline:

    lite300      MACH_LITE300     LITE300      408
    se4200       MACH_SE4200      SE4200       809
    sg310        MACH_SG310       SG310        1564
