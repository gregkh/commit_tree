aoe: make dynamic block minor numbers the default

Because udev use is so widespread, making the old static mapping the
default is too conservative, given the severe limitations it places on
usable AoE addresses.  Storage virtualization and larger shelves have made
the old limitations too confining.

These changes make the dynamic block device minor numbers the default,
removing the limitations on usable AoE addresses.

The static arrangement is still available with aoe_dyndevs=0, and the
aoe-stat tool from the userland aoetools package, the user space
counterpart to the aoe driver, recognizes the case where there is a
mismatch between the minor number in sysfs and the minor number in a
special device file.
