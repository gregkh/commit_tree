qmi_wwan/cdc_ether: move Novatel 551 and E362 to qmi_wwan

These devices provide QMI and ethernet functionality via a standard CDC
ethernet descriptor.  But when driven by cdc_ether, the QMI
functionality is unavailable because only cdc_ether can claim the USB
interface.  Thus blacklist the devices in cdc_ether and add their IDs to
qmi_wwan, which enables both QMI and ethernet simultaneously.
