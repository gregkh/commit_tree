vxlan: Fix error that was resulting in VXLAN MTU size being 10 bytes too large

This change fixes an issue I found where VXLAN frames were fragmented when
they were up to the VXLAN MTU size.  I root caused the issue to the fact that
the headroom was 4 + 20 + 8 + 8.  This math doesn't appear to be correct
because we are not inserting a VLAN header, but instead a 2nd Ethernet header.
As such the math for the overhead should be 20 + 8 + 8 + 14 to account for the
extra headers that are inserted for VXLAN.
