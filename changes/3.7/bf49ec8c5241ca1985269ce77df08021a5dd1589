drm/i915: add encoder->pre_enable/post_disable

The cpu eDP encoder has some horrible hacks to set up the DP pll at
the right time. To be able to move them to the right place, add some
more encoder callbacks so that this can happen at the right time.

LVDS has some similar funky hacks, but that would require more work
(we need to move around the pll setup a bit). Hence for now only
wire these new callbacks up for ilk+ - we only have cpu eDP on these
platforms.

v2: Bikeshed the vtable ordering, requested by Chris Wilson.
