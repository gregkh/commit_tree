ima: change flags container data type

IMA audit hashes patches introduced new IMA flags and required
space went beyond 8 bits. Currently the only flag is IMA_DIGSIG.
This patch use 16 bit short instead of 8 bit char.
Without this fix IMA signature will be replaced with hash, which
should not happen.
