drm/i915: Introduce drm_i915_gem_object_ops

In order to specialise functions depending upon the type of object, we
can attach vfuncs to each object via a new ->ops pointer.

For instance, this will be used in future patches to only bind pages from
a dma-buf for the duration that the object is used by the GPU - and so
prevent them from pinning those pages for the entire of the object.

v2: Bonus comments.
