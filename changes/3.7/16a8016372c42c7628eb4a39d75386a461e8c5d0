sanitize tsk_is_polling()

Make default just return 0.  The current default (checking
TIF_POLLING_NRFLAG) is taken to architectures that need it;
ones that don't do polling in their idle threads don't need
to defined TIF_POLLING_NRFLAG at all.

ia64 defined both TS_POLLING (used by its tsk_is_polling())
and TIF_POLLING_NRFLAG (not used at all).  Killed the latter...
