[media] tvp514x: s_routing should just change routing, not try to detect a signal

The s_routing function should not try to detect a signal. It is a really
bad idea to try to detect a valid video signal and return an error if
you can't. Changing input should do just that and nothing more.
Also don't power on the ADCs on s_routing, instead do that on querystd.
