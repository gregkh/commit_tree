mm: replace vma prio_tree with an interval tree

Implement an interval tree as a replacement for the VMA prio_tree.  The
algorithms are similar to lib/interval_tree.c; however that code can't be
directly reused as the interval endpoints are not explicitly stored in the
VMA.  So instead, the common algorithm is moved into a template and the
details (node type, how to get interval endpoints from the node, etc) are
filled in using the C preprocessor.

Once the interval tree functions are available, using them as a
replacement to the VMA prio tree is a relatively simple, mechanical job.
