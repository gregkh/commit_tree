powerpc/booke64: Eemove mfspr srr1 duplicate in exception prolog

Refactor exception prolog to get rid of mfspr srr1 duplicate. This was
introduced by KVM integration, with DO_KVM macro logic expecting srr1 value
earlier in r11.
Reserve r11 to hold srr1's value also required at the end of the prolog and
free up r10 to serve as spare in addition macros.
For syscalls case this change does not add any performance penalty. For irq
soft-disabled case the change adds a store/load of conditional register value
to/from a paca slot. Paca slots fit in one 64-byte cache line so these
additional operations have little impact on performance.
