sctp: Error in calculation of RTTvar

The calculation of RTTVAR involves the subtraction of two unsigned
numbers which
may causes rollover and results in very high values of RTTVAR when RTT > SRTT.
With this patch it is possible to set RTOmin = 1 to get the minimum of RTO at
4 times the clock granularity.

Change Notes:

v2)
        *Replaced abs() by abs64() and long by __s64, changed patch
