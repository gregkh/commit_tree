binfmt_elf: Uninitialized variable

load_elf_interp() has interp_map_addr carefully described as
"uninitialized_var" and marked so as to avoid a warning.  However if you
trace the code it is passed into load_elf_interp and then this value is
checked against NULL.

As this return value isn't used this is actually safe but it freaks
various analysis tools that see un-initialized memory addresses being read
before their value is ever defined.

Set it to NULL as a matter of programming good taste if nothing else
