AM35xx: Add missing hwmod entry for the HDQ/1-Wire present in AM3505/3517 CPUs.

This patch adds a missing hwmod entry for the HDQ/1-Wire module present
in the AM3505/17 CPUs.

This restores 1-Wire support to our AM3505 boards. We think it probably
stopped working with commit 96b1b29d37b0ca3ecd424a1fe301406cf525fc04
