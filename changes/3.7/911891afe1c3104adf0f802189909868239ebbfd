thp: move khugepaged_mutex out of khugepaged

Currently, hugepaged_mutex is used really complexly and hard to
understand, actually, it is just used to serialize start_khugepaged and
khugepaged for these reasons:

- khugepaged_thread is shared between them
- the thp disable path (echo never > transparent_hugepage/enabled) is
  nonblocking, so we need to protect khugepaged_thread to get a stable
  running state

These can be avoided by:

- use the lock to serialize the thread creation and cancel
- thp disable path can not finised until the thread exits

Then khugepaged_thread is fully controlled by start_khugepaged, khugepaged
will be happy without the lock
