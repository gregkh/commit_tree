uprobes: Fix prepare_uprobe() race with itself

install_breakpoint() is called under mm->mmap_sem, this protects
set_swbp() but not prepare_uprobe(). Two or more different tasks
can call install_breakpoint()->prepare_uprobe() at the same time,
this leads to numerous problems if UPROBE_COPY_INSN is not set.

Just for example, the second copy_insn() can corrupt the already
analyzed/fixuped uprobe->arch.insn and race with handle_swbp().

This patch simply adds uprobe->copy_mutex to serialize this code.
We could probably reuse ->consumer_rwsem, but this would mean that
consumer->handler() can not use mm->mmap_sem, not good.

Note: this is another temporary ugly hack until we move this logic
into uprobe_register().
