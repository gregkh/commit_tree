cgroup: revise how we re-populate root directory

When remounting cgroupfs with some subsystems added to it and some
removed, cgroup will remove all the files in root directory and then
re-popluate it.

What I'm doing here is, only remove files which belong to subsystems that
are to be unbinded, and only create files for newly-added subsystems.
The purpose is to have all other files untouched.

This is a preparation for cgroup xattr support.

v7:
- checkpatch warnings fixed
v6:
- no changes
v5:
- no changes
v4:
- refactored cgroup_clear_directory() to not use cgroup_rm_file()
- instead of going thru the list of files, get the file list using the
  subsystems
- use 'subsys_mask' instead of {added,removed}_bits and made
  cgroup_populate_dir() to match the parameters with cgroup_clear_directory()
v3:
- refresh patches after recent refactoring
