rcu: Allow RCU grace-period initialization to be preempted

RCU grace-period initialization is currently carried out with interrupts
disabled, which can result in 200-microsecond latency spikes on systems
on which RCU has been configured for 4096 CPUs.  This patch therefore
makes the RCU grace-period initialization be preemptible, which should
eliminate those latency spikes.  Similar spikes from grace-period cleanup
and the forcing of quiescent states will be dealt with similarly by later
patches.
