target: Add control CDB READ payload zero work-around

This patch carries forward a work-around from tcm_loop to target
core code to explicitly clear control CDB READ paylods in order to
avoid bugs in scsi-generic user-space code for INQUIRY that do not
explicitly zero CDB payload memory.

(v2: Drop TARGET_SCF_MAP_CLEAR_MEM, and perform the explicit zero
     of READ memory for all target_submit_cmd_map_sgls users)
