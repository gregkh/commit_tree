parport_serial: Add support for the WCH353 2S/1P multi-IO card

To allow parport_serial to handle the card the same PCI ids are blacklisted
in 8250_pci.c using the existing software blacklist mechanism.

The blacklist array is also renamed because it now covers this new use
case.

Since the two serial ports are auto-detected as XScale instead of 16550A
clones, we also add a quirk to 8250_pci.c to skip autodetection and set the
correct port type.
