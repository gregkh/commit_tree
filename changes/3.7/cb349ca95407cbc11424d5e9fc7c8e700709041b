rcu: Apply micro-optimization and int/bool fixes to RCU's idle handling

Checking "user" before "is_idle_task()" allows better optimizations
in cases where inlining is possible.  Also, "bool" should be passed
"true" or "false" rather than "1" or "0".  This commit therefore makes
these changes, as noted in Josh's review.
