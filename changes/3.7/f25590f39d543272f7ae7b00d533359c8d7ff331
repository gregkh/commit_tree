iscsi-target: Correctly set 0xffffffff field within ISCSI_OP_REJECT PDU

This patch adds a missing iscsi_reject->ffffffff assignment within
iscsit_send_reject() code to properly follow RFC-3720 Section 10.17
Bytes 16 -> 19 for the PDU format definition of ISCSI_OP_REJECT.

We've not seen any initiators care about this bytes in practice, but
as Ronnie reported this was causing trouble with wireshark packet
decoding lets go ahead and fix this up now.
