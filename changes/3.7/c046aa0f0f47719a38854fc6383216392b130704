tcm_qla2xxx: Format VPD page 83h SCSI name string according to SPC

My draft of SPC-4 says the following about the SCSI name string in
inquiry VPD page 83h:

    The SCSI NAME STRING field starts with either:

    a) the four UTF-8 characters 'eui.' concatenated with 16, 24, or
       32 hexadecimal digits (i.e., the UTF-8 characters 0 through 9
       and A through F) for an EUI-64 based identifier (see
       7.8.6.5). The first hexadecimal digit shall be the most
       significant four bits of the first byte (i.e., most significant
       byte) of the EUI-64 based identifier;
    b) the four UTF-8 characters 'naa.' concatenated with 16 or 32
       hexadecimal digits for an NAA identifier (see 7.8.6.6). The
       first hexadecimal digit shall be the most significant four bits
       of the first byte (i.e., most significant byte) of the NAA
       identifier; or
    c) the four UTF-8 characters 'iqn.' concatenated with an iSCSI
       Name for an iSCSI-name based identifier (see iSCSI).

However, the .tpg_get_wwn method for tcm_qla2xxx formats the WWN so
the SCSI name string looks like "52:4a:93:7d:24:5f:b2:12,t,0x0001".
This patch corrects the code so that VPD 83h gives a SPC-compliant
SCSI name string like "naa.524a937d245fb212,t,0x0001" while leavig
other uses alone (so configfs will still work with ':' separated WWNs).
