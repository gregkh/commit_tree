kernel/debug: Mask KGDB NMI upon entry

The new arch callback should manage NMIs that usually cause KGDB to
enter. That is, not all NMIs should be enabled/disabled, but only
those that issue kgdb_handle_exception().

We must mask it as serial-line interrupt can be used as an NMI, so
if the original KGDB-entry cause was say a breakpoint, then every
input to KDB console will cause KGDB to reenter, which we don't want.
