perf/x86: Enable overflow on Intel KNC with a custom knc_pmu_handle_irq()

Although based on the Intel P6 design, the interrupt mechnanism
for KNC more closely resembles the Intel architectural
perfmon one.

We can't just re-use that code though, because KNC has different
MSR numbers for the status and ack registers.

In this case we just cut-and paste from perf_event_intel.c
with some minor changes, as it looks like it would not be
worth the trouble to change that code to be MSR-configurable.
