drm/i915: Use new INSTDONE registers (Gen7+)

Using the extracted INSTDONE reading, and our new register definitions,
update our hangcheck detection and error collection to use it. This
primarily means changing == to memcmp, and changing = to memcpy.
Hopefully this will give more info on error dump, and provide more
accurate hangcheck detection (both are actually TBD).

Also, remove the reading of instdone1 from the ring error collection
function, and just crap everything in capture_error_state (that could be
split into a separate patch if it wasn't so trivial).

v2: Now assuming i915_get_extra_instdone does the memset we can clean up the
code a bit (Jani)

v3: use ARRAY_SIZE as requested earlier by Jani (didn't change sizeof)
