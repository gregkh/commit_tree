locking: Adjust spin lock inlining Kconfig options

Break out the DEBUG_SPINLOCK dependency (requires moving up
UNINLINE_SPIN_UNLOCK, as this was the only one in that block not
depending on that option).

Avoid putting values not selected into the resulting .config -
they are not useful for anything, make the output less legible,
and just consume space: Use "depends on" rather than directly
setting the default from the combined dependency values.
