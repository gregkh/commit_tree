ARM: OMAP: unwrap strings

Find and unwrap wrapped strings in the style:

	pr_debug("clockdomain: hardware cannot set/clear wake up of "
		 "%s when %s wakes up\n", clkdm1->name, clkdm2->name);

Keeping these strings contiguous seems to be the current Linux kernel
policy.

The offending lines were found with the following command:

    pcregrep -rnM '"\s*$\s*"' arch/arm/*omap*

While here, some messages have been clarified, some pr_warning(
... calls have been converted to pr_warn( ..., and some printk(KERN_*
... have been converted to pr_*.
