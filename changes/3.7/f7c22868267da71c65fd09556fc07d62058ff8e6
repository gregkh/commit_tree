staging: comedi: 8255_pci: fix namespace due to rename of driver

Due to the rename of this file, change all the adl_pci7296_* to
pci_8255_* so that everything has namespace associated with this
driver.

Also, fix the comedi description comment based on the rename of
the file. Remove the extra comment about the driver attach.

Modify the PCI_DEVICE_ID_* defines in preparation of moving
additional vendor/device ids into this driver.
