[SCSI] fc-transport: Remove unnecessary include

This header file is included in user space applications
that are doing "FC Passthrough." This include causes
them to also include scsi/scsi.h. Since this header
file doesn't actually need scsi/scsi.h, remove the
include line.

This patch was tested with 'make allyesconfig'.
