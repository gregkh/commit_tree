8250_pnp: do pnp probe before legacy probe

We first probe the legacy serial ports and then check pnp. If there
is a non-standard configuration then this might not work, also this
change is needed so we can blacklist Winbond CIR based on PNP ID.

For this to work the 8250_pnp driver must be merged into the 8250
module.
