rbtree: break out of rb_insert_color loop after tree rotation

It is a well known property of rbtrees that insertion never requires more
than two tree rotations.  In our implementation, after one loop iteration
identified one or two necessary tree rotations, we would iterate and look
for more.  However at that point the node's parent would always be black,
which would cause us to exit the loop.

We can make the code flow more obvious by just adding a break statement
after the tree rotations, where we know we are done.  Additionally, in the
cases where two tree rotations are necessary, we don't have to update the
'node' pointer as it wouldn't be used until the next loop iteration, which
we now avoid due to this break statement.
