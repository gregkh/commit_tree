inet_diag: validate port comparison byte code to prevent unsafe reads

Add logic to verify that a port comparison byte code operation
actually has the second inet_diag_bc_op from which we read the port
for such operations.

Previously the code blindly referenced op[1] without first checking
whether a second inet_diag_bc_op struct could fit there. So a
malicious user could make the kernel read 4 bytes beyond the end of
the bytecode array by claiming to have a whole port comparison byte
code (2 inet_diag_bc_op structs) when in fact the bytecode was not
long enough to hold both.
