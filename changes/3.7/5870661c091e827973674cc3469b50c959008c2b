x86: Prefer TZCNT over BFS

Following a relatively recent compiler change, make use of the
fact that for non-zero input BSF and TZCNT produce the same
result, and that CPUs not knowing of TZCNT will treat the
instruction as BSF (i.e. ignore what looks like a REP prefix to
them). The assumption here is that TZCNT would never have worse
performance than BSF.

For the moment, only do this when the respective generic-CPU
option is selected (as there are no specific-CPU options
covering the CPUs supporting TZCNT), and don't do that when size
optimization was requested.
