vfs: make path_openat take a struct filename pointer

...and fix up the callers. For do_file_open_root, just declare a
struct filename on the stack and fill out the .name field. For
do_filp_open, make it also take a struct filename pointer, and fix up its
callers to call it appropriately.

For filp_open, add a variant that takes a struct filename pointer and turn
filp_open into a wrapper around it.
