mm, numa: avoid setting zone_reclaim_mode unless a node is sufficiently distant

Commit 957f822a0ab9 ("mm, numa: reclaim from all nodes within reclaim
distance") caused zone_reclaim_mode to be set for all systems where two
nodes are within RECLAIM_DISTANCE of each other.  This is the opposite
of what we actually want: zone_reclaim_mode should be set if two nodes
are sufficiently distant.
