rcu: Protect rcu_node accesses during CPU stall warnings

The print_other_cpu_stall() function accesses a number of rcu_node
fields without protection from the ->lock.  In theory, this is not
a problem because the fields accessed are all integers, but in
practice the compiler can get nasty.  Therefore, the commit extends
the existing critical section to cover the entire loop body.
