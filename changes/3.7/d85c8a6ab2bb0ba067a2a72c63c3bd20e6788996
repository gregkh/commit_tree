MAINTAINERS: i2c: 7 years, this is it

I have been maintaining the i2c subsystem for 7 years now, it's about
time to let someone else take over. Just before I leave, I would like
to thank several individuals who made this possible at all:

* Greg Kroah-Hartman, for his faith in my potential subsystem
  maintainer skills. Greg, I hope I met your expectations.
* Late David Brownell, for helping me convert the i2c subsystem to the
  standard device driver model. Rest in peace David, we're missing you.
* Ben Dooks, for stepping in when I asked for someone to take care of
  the huge flow of new i2c adapter drivers for embedded systems.
* Wolfram Sang, for joining the crew when it became clear that there
  was more review work than Ben and myself could deal with.

I hope I did not forget anyone, please forgive me if I did.

Another big thank is due to Wolfram again, who quickly proposed to
take over as the main i2c subsystem maintainer. This will allow for a
smooth and fast transition.

Note that I will keep maintaining all I2C/SMBus controller drivers for
PC systems as well as a few others. I am hereby updating MAINTAINERS
accordingly. I'll also keep maintaining user-space i2c-tools.
