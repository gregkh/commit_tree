[media] rc: divide by zero bugs in s_tx_carrier()

"carrier" comes from a get_user() in ir_lirc_ioctl().  We need to test
that it's not zero before using it as a divisor.  It might have been
nice to test for this ir_lirc_ioctl() but the mceusb driver uses zero to
disable carrier modulation.
The bug in redrat3 is a little more subtle.  The ->carrier is passed to
mod_freq_to_val() which uses it as a divisor.
