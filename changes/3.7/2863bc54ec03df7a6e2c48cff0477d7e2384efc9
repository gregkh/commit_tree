Revert strace hiccups fix.

This reverts commit 40138249c3b7a0762155216b963ec7fd4d09b5b4 and
ffa9009c9828db3f74178e459cfbca6e77ff5dd9.

There are problems with how the flag bytes were rearranged, in
particular we really can't move values down into the lowest
16 bits since those are used for individual state bits.
