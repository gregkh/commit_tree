drm/i915: WARN when trying to enabled an unused crtc

This is the first tiny step towards cross-checking the entire modeset
state machine with WARNs. A crtc can only be enabled when it's
actually in use, i.e. crtc->active imlies crtc->enabled.

Unfortunately we can't (yet) check this when disabling the crtc,
because the crtc helpers are a bit slopy with updating state and
unconditionally update crtc->enabled before changing the hw state.

Fixing that requires quite some more work.
