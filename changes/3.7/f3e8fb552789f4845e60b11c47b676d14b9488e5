NFC: Modified hci_transceive to become an asynchronous operation

This enables the completion callback to be called from a different
context, preventing a possible deadlock if the callback resulted in the
invocation of a nested call to the currently locked nfc_dev.
This is also more in line with the im_transceive nfc_ops for NFC Core or
NCI drivers which already behave asynchronously.
