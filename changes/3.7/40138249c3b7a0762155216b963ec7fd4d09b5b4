sparc64: Rearrange thread info to cheaply clear syscall noerror state.

After fixing a couple of brainos, it even seems to work.  What's done here
is move of ->syscall_noerror right before FPDEPTH byte in ->flags and
using sth to [%g6 + TI_SYS_NOERROR] instead of stb to [%g6 + TI_FPDEPTH] in
both branches of etrap_save.  AFAICS, that ought to be solid.  Again,
deciding what to do with now unused delay slot of branch on ->syscall_noerror
and dealing with the order of tests in ret_from_sys is a separate question,
but at least that way we don't have to clean ->syscall_noerror in there at
all.  AFAICS, it ought to be a clear win - sth is not going to cost more than
stb on etrap_64.S side of things, and we are losing write on syscalls.S one.
