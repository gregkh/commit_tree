Staging: ipack/bridges/tpci200: Protect device registers with spinlock.

Some of the device registers are accessed from both interrupt and
non-interrupt context.  To ensure proper read-modify-write modification
of these registers we can not use the  "global" tpci200 mutex.  Instead
a spin-lock is used.
