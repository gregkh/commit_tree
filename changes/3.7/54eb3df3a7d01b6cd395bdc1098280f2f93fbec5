netfilter: xt_time: add support to ignore day transition

Currently, if you want to do something like:
"match Monday, starting 23:00, for two hours"
You need two rules, one for Mon 23:00 to 0:00 and one for Tue 0:00-1:00.

The rule: --weekdays Mo --timestart 23:00  --timestop 01:00

looks correct, but it will first match on monday from midnight to 1 a.m.
and then again for another hour from 23:00 onwards.

This permits userspace to explicitly ignore the day transition and
match for a single, continuous time period instead.
