btrfs: extended inode ref iteration

The iterate_irefs in backref.c is used to build path components from inode
refs. This patch adds code to iterate extended refs as well.

I had modify the callback function signature to abstract out some of the
differences between ref structures. iref_to_path() also needed similar
changes.
