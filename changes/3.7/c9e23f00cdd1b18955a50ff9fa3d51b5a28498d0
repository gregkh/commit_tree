ARM: dts: Assume status of all optional nodes as disabled for exynos4

Currently all boards must explicitly disable all unused device tree
nodes of unused components (e.g. i2c, sdhci, etc...). This makes it
necessary to all boards to be aware of all components on the SoC, which
in turns makes board dts files longer and more difficult to maintain
(e.g. adding new components to SoC-level tree requires adding nodes with
status="disabled" to every board).

This patch changes "status" of all optional components in SoC-level dts
file to "disabled", adds status="okay" to respective nodes of used
components in dts of all boards and removes all nodes with only
status="disabled" from boards dts.
