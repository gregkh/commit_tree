tools/power turbostat: make -M output pretty

The -M option dumps the specified 64-bit MSR with every sample.

Previously it was output at the end of each line.
However, with the v2 style of printing, the lines are now staggered,
making MSR output hard to read.

So move the MSR output column to the left where things are aligned.
