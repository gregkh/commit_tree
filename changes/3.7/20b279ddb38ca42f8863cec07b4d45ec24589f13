perf: Require exclude_guest to use PEBS - kernel side enforcement

Intel PEBS in VT-x context uses the DS address as a guest linear
address, even though its programmed by the host as a host linear
address. This either results in guest memory corruption and or the
hardware faulting and 'crashing' the virtual machine.  Therefore we have
to disable PEBS on VT-x enter and re-enable on VT-x exit, enforcing a
strict exclude_guest.

This patch enforces exclude_guest kernel side.
