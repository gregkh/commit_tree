ath9k: flush bt profile whenever it is requested

Before processing BT profiles or status messages, check whether
it is requested to flush BT profile. Otherwise it might increase
number of BT profiles that affects the WLAN performance. Also
flush the profiles when MCI is recovering from broken rx. After
flushing BT profiles, query BT topology to refetch them.
