perf evsel: Cache associated event_format

We already lookup the associated event_format when reading the perf.data
header, so that we can cache the tracepoint name in evsel->name, so do
it a little further and save the event_format itself, so that we can
avoid relookups in tools that need to access it.

Change the tools to take the most obvious advantage, when they were
using pevent_find_event directly. More work is needed for further
removing the need of a pointer to pevent, such as when asking for event
field values ("common_pid" and the other common fields and per
event_format fields).

This is something that was planned but only got actually done when
Andrey Wagin needed to do this lookup at perf_tool->sample() time, when
we don't have access to pevent (session->pevent) to use with
pevent_find_event().
