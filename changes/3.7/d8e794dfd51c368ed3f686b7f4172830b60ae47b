workqueue: set delayed_work->timer function on initialization

delayed_work->timer.function is currently initialized during
queue_delayed_work_on().  Export delayed_work_timer_fn() and set
delayed_work timer function during delayed_work initialization
together with other fields.

This ensures the timer function is always valid on an initialized
delayed_work.  This is to help mod_delayed_work() implementation.

To detect delayed_work users which diddle with the internal timer,
trigger WARN if timer function doesn't match on queue.
