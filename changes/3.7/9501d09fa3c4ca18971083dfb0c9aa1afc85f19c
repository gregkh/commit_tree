thp, s390: thp pagetable pre-allocation for s390

This patch is part of the architecture backend for thp on s390.  It
provides the pagetable pre-allocation functions
pgtable_trans_huge_deposit() and pgtable_trans_huge_withdraw().  Unlike
other archs, s390 has no struct page * as pgtable_t, but rather a pointer
to the page table.  So instead of saving the pagetable pre- allocation
list info inside the struct page, it is being saved within the pagetable
itself.
