staging: comedi: me_daq: use attach_pci callback

Convert this PCI driver to use the comedi PCI auto config attach
mechanism by adding an 'attach_pci' callback function. Since the
driver does not require any external configuration options. and
the legacy 'attach' callback is now optional, remove it.

Also, make the boardinfo 'name' unique for the different board types.
Use this name when requesting the PCI resources. Change the printk
at the end of the attach into a dev_info.
