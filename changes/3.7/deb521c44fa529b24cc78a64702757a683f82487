remap_file_pages: correctly handle the case of a NULL vm_ops pointer

In commit 0b173bc4daa8 ("mm: kill vma flag VM_CAN_NONLINEAR") we
replaced the VM_CAN_NONLINEAR test with checking whether the mapping has
a '->remap_pages()' vm operation, but there is no guarantee that there
it even has a vm_ops pointer at all.

Add the appropriate test for NULL vm_ops.
