    drm/i915: parse eDP panel color depth from VBT block

originally introduced parsing bpp for eDP from VBT, with a default of 18
bpp if the eDP BIOS data block is not present. Turns out that default seems
to break the Macbook Pro with retina display, as noted in

    drm/i915: ignore eDP bpc settings from vbt

Since we can't ignore bpc settings from VBT completely after all, get rid
of the default. Do not clamp eDP to 18 bpp by default if the eDP BDB is
missing from VBT.
