rbd: rename block_name -> object_prefix

In the on-disk image header structure there is a field "block_name"
which represents what we now call the "object prefix" for an rbd
image.  Rename this field "object_prefix" to be consistent with
modern usage.

This appears to be the only remaining vestige of the use of "block"
in symbols that represent objects in the rbd code.
