trace: Don't declare trace_*_rcuidle functions in modules

Tracepoints declare a static inline trace_*_rcuidle variant of the trace
function, to support safely generating trace events from the idle loop.
Module code never actually uses that variant of trace functions, because
modules don't run code that needs tracing with RCU idled.  However, the
declaration of those otherwise unused functions causes the module to
reference rcu_idle_exit and rcu_idle_enter, which RCU does not export to
modules.

To avoid this, don't generate trace_*_rcuidle functions for tracepoints
declared in module code.
