x86/mm: Fix range check in tlbflush debugfs interface

Since the shift count settable there is used for shifting values
of type "unsigned long", its value must not match or exceed
BITS_PER_LONG (otherwise the shift operations are undefined).

Similarly, the value must not be negative (but -1 must be
permitted, as that's the value used to distinguish the case of
the fine grained flushing being disabled).
