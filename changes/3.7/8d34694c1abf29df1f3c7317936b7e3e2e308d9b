revert "mm: mempolicy: Let vma_merge and vma_split handle vma->vm_policy linkages"

Commit 05f144a0d5c2 ("mm: mempolicy: Let vma_merge and vma_split handle
vma->vm_policy linkages") removed vma->vm_policy updates code but it is
the purpose of mbind_range().  Now, mbind_range() is virtually a no-op
and while it does not allow memory corruption it is not the right fix.
This patch is a revert.
