ARM: consolidate pen_release instead of having per platform definitions

Almost each SMP platform defines pen_release to manage booting secondary
CPUs. This of course clashes with the single zImage effort.

Add the pen_release definition to the ARM SMP code, and remove all others.
This should only be used by platforms which lack any kind of CPU power
management...
