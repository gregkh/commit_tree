arm64: SMP support

This patch adds SMP initialisation and spinlocks implementation for
AArch64. The spinlock support uses the new load-acquire/store-release
instructions to avoid explicit barriers. The architecture also specifies
that an event is automatically generated when clearing the exclusive
monitor state to wake up processors in WFE, so there is no need for an
explicit DSB/SEV instruction sequence. The SEVL instruction is used to
set the exclusive monitor locally as there is no conditional WFE and a
branch is more expensive.

For the SMP booting protocol, see Documentation/arm64/booting.txt.
