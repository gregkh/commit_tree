KVM: VMX: Separate saving pre-realmode state from setting segments

Commit b246dd5df139 ("KVM: VMX: Fix KVM_SET_SREGS with big real mode
segments") moved fix_rmode_seg() to vmx_set_segment(), so that it is
applied not just on transitions to real mode, but also on KVM_SET_SREGS
(migration).  However fix_rmode_seg() not only munges the vmcs segments,
it also sets up the save area for us to restore when returning to
protected mode or to return in vmx_get_segment().

Move saving the segment into a new function, save_rmode_seg(), and
call it just during the transition.
