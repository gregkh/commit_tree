mempolicy: fix refcount leak in mpol_set_shared_policy()

When shared_policy_replace() fails to allocate new->policy is not freed
correctly by mpol_set_shared_policy().  The problem is that shared
mempolicy code directly call kmem_cache_free() in multiple places where
it is easy to make a mistake.

This patch creates an sp_free wrapper function and uses it. The bug was
introduced pre-git age (IOW, before 2.6.12-rc2).
