[media] media: coda: Add driver for Coda video codec

Coda is a range of video codecs from Chips&Media that
support H.264, H.263, MPEG4 and other video standards.

Currently only support for the codadx6 included in the
i.MX27 SoC is added. H.264 and MPEG4 video encoding
are the only supported capabilities by now.
