staging: comedi: pcmmio: remove kernel messages about IRQ

These messages are just added noise.

They also cause some sparse warnings due to MAX_ASICS evaluating
as 1. This causes the local variable 'irq' to be 'unsigned int irq[1]',
which makes the 'irq[1]' access invalid.

Just remove the messages.
