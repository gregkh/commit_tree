ipv6: GRO should be ECN friendly

IPv4 side of the problem was addressed in commit a9e050f4e7f9d
(net: tcp: GRO should be ECN friendly)

This patch does the same, but for IPv6 : A Traffic Class mismatch
doesnt mean flows are different, but instead should force a flush
of previous packets.

This patch removes artificial packet reordering problem.
