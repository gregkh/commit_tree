mm: Use __do_krealloc to do the krealloc job

Without this patch we can get (many) kmem trace events
with call site at krealloc().

This happens because krealloc is calling __krealloc,
which performs the allocation through kmalloc_track_caller.

Since neither krealloc nor __krealloc are marked inline explicitly,
the caller can be traced as being krealloc, which clearly is not
the intended behavior.

This patch allows to get the real caller of krealloc, by creating
an always inlined function __do_krealloc, thus tracing the
call site accurately.
