ext4: move_extent code cleanup

- Remove usless checks, because it is too late to check that inode != NULL
  at the moment it was referenced several times.
- Double lock routines looks very ugly and locking ordering relays on
  order of i_ino, but other kernel code rely on order of pointers.
  Let's make them simple and clean.
- check that inodes belongs to the same SB as soon as possible.
