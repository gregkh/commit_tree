igb: Change how we check for pre-existing and assigned VFs

Adapt the pre-existing and assigned VFs code to the ixgbe way introduced
in commit 9297127b9cdd8d30c829ef5fd28b7cc0323a7bcd.

Instead of searching the enabled VFs we use pci_num_vf to determine enabled VFs.
By comparing to which PF an assigned VF is owned it's possible to decide
whether to leave it enabled or not.
