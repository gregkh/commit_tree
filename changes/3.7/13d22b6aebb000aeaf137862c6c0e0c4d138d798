KVM: MMU: Simplify walk_addr_generic() loop

The page table walk is coded as an infinite loop, with a special
case on the last pte.

Code it as an ordinary loop with a termination condition on the last
pte (large page or walk length exhausted), and put the last pte handling
code after the loop where it belongs.
