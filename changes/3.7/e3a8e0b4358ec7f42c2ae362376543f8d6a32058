mwifiex: don't disable wait_q_enabled flag

We should not disable "cmd_node->wait_q_enabled" flag here before
calling mwifiex_insert_cmd_to_free_q() because we want to wake up
the thread waiting for command completion inside this function.

The wait_q_enabled flag will be disabled internally upon command
completion.
