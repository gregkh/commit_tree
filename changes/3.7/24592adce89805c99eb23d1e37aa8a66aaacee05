[media] soc-camera: Continue the power off sequence if one of the steps fails

Powering off a device is a "best effort" task: failure to execute one of
the steps should not prevent the next steps to be executed. For
instance, an I2C communication error when putting the chip in stand-by
mode should not prevent the more agressive next step of turning the
chip's power supply off.
