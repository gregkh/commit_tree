net: Fix skb_under_panic oops in neigh_resolve_output

The retry loop in neigh_resolve_output() and neigh_connected_output()
call dev_hard_header() with out reseting the skb to network_header.
This causes the retry to fail with skb_under_panic. The fix is to
reset the network_header within the retry loop.
