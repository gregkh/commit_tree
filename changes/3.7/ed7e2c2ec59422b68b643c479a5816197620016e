perf tools: Fix include order for bison/flex-generated C files

When we use a separate output directory, we add util/ to the include
path for the generated C files.  However, this is currently added to the
end of the path, behind /usr/include/slang and /usr/include/gtk-2.0 if
use of the respective libraries is enabled.  Thus the '#include
"../perf.h"' in util/parse-events.l can actually include
/usr/include/perf.h if it exists.

Move '-Iutil/' ahead of all the other preprocessor options.
