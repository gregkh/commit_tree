md/raid5: move resolving of reconstruct_state earlier in
stripe_handle.

The chunk of code in stripe_handle which responds to a
*_result value in reconstruct_state is really the completion
of some processing that happened outside of handle_stripe
(possibly asynchronously) and so should be one of the first
things done in handle_stripe().

After the next patch it will be important that it happens before
handle_stripe_clean_event(), as that will clear some dev->flags
bit that this code tests.
