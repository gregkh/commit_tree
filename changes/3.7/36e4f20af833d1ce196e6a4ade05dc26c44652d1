hugetlb: do not use vma_hugecache_offset() for vma_prio_tree_foreach

Commit 0c176d52b0b2 ("mm: hugetlb: fix pgoff computation when unmapping
page from vma") fixed pgoff calculation but it has replaced it by
vma_hugecache_offset() which is not approapriate for offsets used for
vma_prio_tree_foreach() because that one expects index in page units
rather than in huge_page_shift.

Johannes said:

: The resulting index may not be too big, but it can be too small: assume
: hpage size of 2M and the address to unmap to be 0x200000.  This is regular
: page index 512 and hpage index 1.  If you have a VMA that maps the file
: only starting at the second huge page, that VMAs vm_pgoff will be 512 but
: you ask for offset 1 and miss it even though it does map the page of
: interest.  hugetlb_cow() will try to unmap, miss the vma, and retry the
: cow until the allocation succeeds or the skipped vma(s) go away.
