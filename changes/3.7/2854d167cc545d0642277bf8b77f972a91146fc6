irqdomain: augment add_simple() to allocate descs

Currently we rely on all IRQ chip instances to dynamically
allocate their IRQ descriptors unless they use the linear
IRQ domain. So for irqdomain_add_legacy() and
irqdomain_add_simple() the caller need to make sure that
descriptors are allocated.

Let's slightly augment the yet unused irqdomain_add_simple()
to also allocate descriptors as a means to simplify usage
and avoid code duplication throughout the kernel.

We warn if descriptors cannot be allocated, e.g. if a
platform has the bad habit of hogging descriptors at boot
time.
