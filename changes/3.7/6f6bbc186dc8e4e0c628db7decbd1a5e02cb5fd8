ethtool.h: MDI setting support

This change modifies the core ethtool struct to allow a driver to
support setting of MDI/MDI-X state for twisted pair wiring.  This
change uses a previously reserved u8 and should not change any
binary compatibility of ethtool.

Also as per Ben Hutchings' suggestion, the capabilities are
stored in a separate byte so the driver can report if it supports
changing settings.
