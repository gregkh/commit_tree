rcu: Prevent offline CPUs from executing RCU core code

Earlier versions of RCU invoked the RCU core from the CPU_DYING notifier
in order to note a quiescent state for the outgoing CPU.  Because the
CPU is marked "offline" during the execution of the CPU_DYING notifiers,
the RCU core had to tolerate being invoked from an offline CPU.  However,
commit b1420f1c (Make rcu_barrier() less disruptive) left only tracing
code in the CPU_DYING notifier, so the RCU core need no longer execute
on offline CPUs.  This commit therefore enforces this restriction.
