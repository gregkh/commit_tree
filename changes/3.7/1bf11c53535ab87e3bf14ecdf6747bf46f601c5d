percpu-rw-semaphores: use rcu_read_lock_sched

Use rcu_read_lock_sched / rcu_read_unlock_sched / synchronize_sched
instead of rcu_read_lock / rcu_read_unlock / synchronize_rcu.

This is an optimization. The RCU-protected region is very small, so
there will be no latency problems if we disable preempt in this region.

So we use rcu_read_lock_sched / rcu_read_unlock_sched that translates
to preempt_disable / preempt_disable. It is smaller (and supposedly
faster) than preemptible rcu_read_lock / rcu_read_unlock.
