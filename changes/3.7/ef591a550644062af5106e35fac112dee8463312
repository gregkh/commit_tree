scripts/Makefile.modpost: error in finding modules from .mod files.

This error may happen when the user's id or path includes .ko string.
For example, user's id is xxx.ko and building test.ko module,
the test.mod file lists ko name and all object files.
   /home/xxx.ko/kernel_dev/device/drivers/test.ko
   /home/xxx.ko/kernel_dev/device/drivers/test_main.o
/home/xxx.ko/kernel_dev/device/drivers/test_io.o ...
Current Makefile.modpost and Makefile.modinst find and list up not
only test.ko but also other object files.
because all of object file's path includes .ko string.
This is a patch to fix it.
