alpha: simplify TIF_NEED_RESCHED handling

In case we have both NEED_RESCHED and SIGPENDING/NOTIFY_RESUME,
handle the latter first.  We'll get to original priorities in
the next commit, but now that allows to simplify the treatment
of NEED_RESCHED-only case nicely.  Namely, now there no need to
preserve the data for restarts across the call of schedule() in
$work_resched; we can get there only if we had either returned
from syscall without SIGPENDING (in which case we should've
had no restart-worthy return value and want no restarts) or
already got through do_notify_resume() call (in which case we
want no restarts anymore).  So we can just slap 0 into $19
instead of preserving it (and $20).
