userns: Modify dqget to take struct kqid

Modify dqget to take struct kqid instead of a type and an identifier
pair.

Modify the callers of dqget in ocfs2 and dquot to take generate
a struct kqid so they can continue to call dqget.  The conversion
to create struct kqid should all be the final conversions that
are needed in those code paths.
