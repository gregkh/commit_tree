ALSA: hda - use both input paths on Conexant auto parser

On the Thinkpad W520 - and probably several other machines with
Conexant 506x chips - the Dock Mic and Mic are connected to the
same two selector nodes. This patch will make Dock Mic take one
selector node and Mic take the other, when possible.

Without the patch, both paths would take the first selector,
leading to the normal Mic's volume being controlled by
"Dock Mic Boost".
(On other machines, this could instead fixup similar problems between
Mic and Line In, for example.)
