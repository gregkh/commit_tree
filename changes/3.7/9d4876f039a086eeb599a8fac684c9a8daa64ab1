ARM: 7507/1: cache-l2x0.c: save the final aux ctrl value for resuming

There is a bug if l2x0 controller has been enabled when calling
l2x0_init, the aux ctrl register will not be saved in l2x0_saved_regs.
Therefore we will use uninitialized l2x0_saved_regs.aux_ctrl for
resuming later.

In this patch, the aux ctrl value is read and saved after it is
initialized. So we have the real value being set for resuming.
