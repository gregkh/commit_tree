efi: Add a function to look up existing IO memory mappings

The EFI initialization creates virtual mappings for EFI boot services
memory, so if a driver wants to access EFI boot services memory, it
cannot call ioremap itself; doing so will trip the WARN about mapping
RAM twice.  Thus, a driver accessing EFI boot services memory must do so
via the existing mapping already created during EFI intiialization.
Since the EFI code already maintains a memory map for that memory, add a
function efi_lookup_mapped_addr to look up mappings in that memory map.
