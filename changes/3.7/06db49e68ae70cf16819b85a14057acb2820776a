ext4: fix metadata checksum calculation for the superblock

The function ext4_handle_dirty_super() was calculating the superblock
on the wrong block data.  As a result, when the superblock is modified
while it is mounted (most commonly, when inodes are added or removed
from the orphan list), the superblock checksum would be wrong.  We
didn't notice because the superblock *was* being correctly calculated
in ext4_commit_super(), and this would get called when the file system
was unmounted.  So the problem only became obvious if the system
crashed while the file system was mounted.

Fix this by removing the poorly designed function signature for
ext4_superblock_csum_set(); if it only took a single argument, the
pointer to a struct superblock, the ambiguity which caused this
mistake would have been impossible.
