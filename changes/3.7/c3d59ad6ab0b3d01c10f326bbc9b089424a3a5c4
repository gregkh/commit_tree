ext3: ext3_bread usage audit

This is the ext3 version of the same patch applied to Ext4, where such goal is
to audit the usage of ext3_bread() due a possible misinterpretion of its return
value.

Focused on directory blocks, a NULL value returned from ext3_bread() means a
hole, which cannot exist into a directory inode. It can pass undetected after a
fix in an uninitialized error variable.

The (now) initialized variable into ext3_getblk() may lead to a zero'ed return
value of ext3_bread() to its callers, which can make the caller do not detect
the hole in the directory inode.

This patch creates a new wrapper function ext3_dir_bread() which checks for
holes properly, reports error, and returns EIO in that case.
