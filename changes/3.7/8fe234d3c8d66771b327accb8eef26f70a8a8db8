s390/mm: fix mapping of read-only kernel text section

Within the identity mapping the kernel text section is mapped read-only.
However when mapping the first and last page of the text section we must
round upwards and downwards respectively, if only parts of a page belong
to the section.
Otherwise potential rw data can be mapped read-only. So the rounding must
be done just the other way we have it right now.
