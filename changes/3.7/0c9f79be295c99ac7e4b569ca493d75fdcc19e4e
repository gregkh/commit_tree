ipv4: avoid undefined behavior in do_ip_setsockopt()

(1<<optname) is undefined behavior in C with a negative optname or
optname larger than 31.  In those cases the result of the shift is
not necessarily zero (e.g., on x86).

This patch simplifies the code with a switch statement on optname.
It also allows the compiler to generate better code (e.g., using a
64-bit mask).
