sparc64: Halve the size of PTE tables

The reason we want to do this is to facilitate transparent huge page
support.

Right now PMD's cover 8MB of address space, and our huge page size is 4MB.
 The current transparent hugepage support is not able to handle HPAGE_SIZE
!= PMD_SIZE.

So make PTE tables be sized to half of a page instead of a full page.

We can still map properly the whole supported virtual address range which
on sparc64 requires 44 bits.  Add a compile time CPP test which ensures
that this requirement is always met.

There is a minor inefficiency added by this change.  We only use half of
the page for PTE tables.  It's not trivial to use only half of the page
yet still get all of the pgtable_page_{ctor,dtor}() stuff working
properly.  It is doable, and that will come in a subsequent change.
