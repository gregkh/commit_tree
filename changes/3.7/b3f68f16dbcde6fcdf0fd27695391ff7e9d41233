task_work: Revert "hold task_lock around checks in keyctl"

This reverts commit d35abdb28824cf74f0a106a0f9c6f3ff700a35bf.

task_lock() was added to ensure exit_mm() and thus exit_task_work() is
not possible before task_work_add().

This is wrong, task_lock() must not be nested with write_lock(tasklist).
And this is no longer needed, task_work_add() now fails if it is called
after exit_task_work().
