[media] cypress_firmware: refactor firmware downloading

Refactor firmware download function. It also should fix one bug
coming from usb_control_msg() message buffers. Taking buffers from
the stack for usb_control_msg() is not allowed as it does not work
on all architectures. Allocate buffers using kmalloc().
