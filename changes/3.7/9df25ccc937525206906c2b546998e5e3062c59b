ARM: tegra: defconfig updates

Removed:

* MACH_HARMONY
* MACH_PAZ00
* MACH_TRIMSLICE

  These used to enable board support for individual boards. Now that we
  only support device tree, these options have been removed.

Added:

* TEGRA_PCI

  This used to be selected by the board options above. Select this
  explicitly now that the board options have been removed.

* TEGRA_DEBUG_UART_AUTO_ODMDATA

  This makes the kernel automatically pick a UART for earlyprintk. It's
  likely to be a useful option for everyone.

* PWM
* PWM_TEGRA

  Enable the new PWM subsystem, and the Tegra driver within it.

* GPIO_PCA953X
* GPIO_PCA953X_IRQ
* MFD_MAX8907
* REGULATOR_MAX8907
* RTC_DRV_MAX8907
* RTC_DRV_TPS65910

  Various drivers required for the Whistler board.

* RTC_INTF_SYSFS
* RTC_INTF_PROC
* RTC_INTF_DEV

  Some RTC options that Kconfig help implies should typically be
  enabled.

* Wifi chip (rt3070)
* Bluetooth (btusb)
* Camera (uvcvideo)
* 3G modem (acm and wdm)
* rfkill
* GPIO LEDs
* NVEC

  Various devices and features found on PAZ00 boards.

  Some of these are enabled as modules because they are not needed for
  boot and will not be used on other boards. Wifi also needs to be
  module because of the firmware loader.

  The update also enabled support for the rfkill switch, the Wifi LED and
  the nvec power and led driver which got lost in the past.

* DEVTMPFS, TMPFS_POSIX_ACL

  These are mandatory on modern linux distros.
