ARM: Fix bad merge bd1274dc005 (Merge branch 'v6v7' into devel)

Commit 774c096bf9e49 (ARM: v6/v7 cache: allow cache calls to be
optimized) got dropped when the merge conflicts for moving the contents
of the files in commit 753790e713d (ARM: move cache/processor/fault
glue to separate include files) was fixed up in merge bd1274dc005
(Merge branch 'v6v7' into devel).

This puts the change back.
