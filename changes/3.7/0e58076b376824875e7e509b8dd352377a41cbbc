[SCSI] scsi_lib: Set the device state from transport-offline to running

FC and iSCSI class set SCSI devices to transport-offline state after
fast_io_fail/replacement_timeout has fired, but after relogin, function
scsi_internal_device_unblock() is not setting scsi device state to running.
Due to this the devices even after being relogged in remain offline.
