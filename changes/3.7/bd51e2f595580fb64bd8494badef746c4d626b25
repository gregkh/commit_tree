ARM: 7506/1: allow for ATAGS to be configured out when DT support is selected

Now that ATAGS support is well contained, we can easily remove it from
the kernel build if so desired.  It has to explicitly be disabled, and
only when DT support is selected.

Note: disabling kernel ATAGS support does not prevent the usage of
CONFIG_ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT.
