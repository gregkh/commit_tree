Input: matrix-keymap - provide proper module license

The matrix-keymap module is currently lacking a proper module license,
add one so we don't have this module tainting the entire kernel.  This
issue has been present since commit 1932811f426f ("Input: matrix-keymap
- uninline and prepare for device tree support")
