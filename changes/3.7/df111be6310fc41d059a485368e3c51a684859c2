rbd: check for overflow in rbd_get_num_segments()

It is possible in rbd_get_num_segments() for an overflow to occur
when adding the offset and length.  This is easily avoided.

Since the function returns an int and the one caller is already
prepared to handle errors, have it return -ERANGE if overflow would
occur.

The overflow check would not work if a zero-length request was
being tested, so short-circuit that case, returning 0 for the
number of segments required.  (This condition might be avoided
elsewhere already, I don't know.)

Have the caller end the request if either an error or 0 is returned.
The returned value is passed to __blk_end_request_all(), meaning
a 0 length request is not treated an error.
