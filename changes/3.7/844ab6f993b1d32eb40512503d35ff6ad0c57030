x86, mm: Find_early_table_space based on ranges that are actually being mapped

Current logic finds enough space for direct mapping page tables from 0
to end. Instead, we only need to find enough space to cover mr[0].start
to mr[nr_range].end -- the range that is actually being mapped by
init_memory_mapping()

This is needed after 1bbbbe779aabe1f0768c2bf8f8c0a5583679b54a, to address
the panic reported here:
