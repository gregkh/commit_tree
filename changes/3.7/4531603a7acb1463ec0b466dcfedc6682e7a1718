brcmfmac: clear status for in-band interrupt in brcmf_sdbrcm_isr

SDIO in-band interrupt is level sensitive according to SDIO standard.
When the register interrupt handler gets called by SDIO stack it is
running in non interrupt context and expected to clear the interrupt
from the dongle. Therefore in-band and out-of-band interrupt need to
be handled differently.
