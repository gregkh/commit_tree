perf tools: Fix x86 builds with ARCH specified on the command line

e.g., compiling i386 on x86_64 using:
$ make -C tools/perf ARCH=i386

fails with:

    CC /tmp/pbuild/util/evsel.o
In file included from util/evsel.c:21:0:
util/perf_regs.h:5:23: fatal error: perf_regs.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Adding V=1 you see that the include argument for the arch is
'-Iarch/i386/include' is wrong. It is supposed to be -Iarch/x86/include
per the redefinition of ARCH in the Makefile.

According to the make manual,
http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Override-Directive:
  "If a variable has been set with a command argument (see Overriding
   Variables), then ordinary assignments in the makefile are ignored. If
   you want to set the variable in the makefile even though it was set
   with a command argument, you can use an override directive ..."

Make it so.
