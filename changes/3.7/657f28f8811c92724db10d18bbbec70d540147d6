mtd: kill MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE

Just as Artem suggested:

"Both UBI and JFFS2 are able to read verify what they wrote already.
There are also MTD tests which do this verification. So I think there
is no reason to keep this in the NAND layer, let alone wasting RAM in
the driver to support this feature. Besides, it does not work for sub-pages
and many drivers have it broken. It hurts more than it provides benefits."

So kill MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE entirely.
