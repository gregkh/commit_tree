mmc: core: Replace MMC_CAP2_BROKEN_VOLTAGE with test for fixed regulator

Before this patch, we were using MMC_CAP2_BROKEN_VOLTAGE as a way to
avoid calling regulator_set_voltage() on a fixed regulator, but that's
just duplicating information that already exists -- we should test
whether the regulator is fixed directly, instead of via a capability.

This patch implements that test.  We can't reclaim the capability bit
just yet, since there are still boards in arch/arm/ that reference it;
those references can be removed now.
