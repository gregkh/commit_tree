pwm: Add support for configuring the PWM polarity

Some hardware supports inverting the polarity of the PWM signal. This
commit adds support to the PWM framework to allow users of the PWM API
to configure the polarity. Note that in order to reduce complexity,
changing the polarity of a PWM signal is only allowed while the PWM is
disabled.

A practical example where this can prove useful is to simulate inversion
of the duty cycle. While inversion of polarity and duty cycle are not
exactly the same, the differences for most use-cases are negligible.
