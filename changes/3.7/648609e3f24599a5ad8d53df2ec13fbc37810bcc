s390: enable large page support with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC

So far, large page support was completely disabled with
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, although it would be sufficient if only the
large page kernel mapping was disabled. This patch enables large page
support with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, while it prevents the large kernel
mapping in that case.
