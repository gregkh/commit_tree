MIPS: Merge overlapping bootmem ranges

Without this, we may end up with something like this in /proc/iomem:

01100000-014fffff : System RAM
  01100000-013bf48f : Kernel code
  013bf490-0149e01f : Kernel data
01500000-0c0fffff : System RAM

but the two System RAM ranges should be one single range.  This particular
case will result in kexec failure on Octeon systems if the kernel being
loaded by kexec is bigger than the already running kernel.
