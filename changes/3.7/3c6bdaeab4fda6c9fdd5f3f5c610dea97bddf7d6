[SCSI] Add a report opcode helper

The REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES command can be used to query
whether a given opcode is supported by a device. Add a helper function
that allows us to look up commands.

We only issue RSOC if the device reports compliance with SPC-3 or
later. But to err on the side of caution we disable the command for ATA,
FireWire and USB.
