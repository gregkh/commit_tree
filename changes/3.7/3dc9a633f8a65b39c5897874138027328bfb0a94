acpi-cpufreq: Add support for modern AMD CPUs

The programming model for P-states on modern AMD CPUs is very similar to
that of Intel and VIA. It makes sense to consolidate this support into one
driver rather than duplicating functionality between two of them. This
patch adds support for AMDs with hardware P-state control to acpi-cpufreq.
