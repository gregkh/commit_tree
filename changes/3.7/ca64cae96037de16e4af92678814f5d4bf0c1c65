md/raid5: Make sure we clear R5_Discard when discard is finished.

commit 9e44476851e91c86c98eb92b9bc27fb801f89072
    MD: raid5 avoid unnecessary zero page for trim

change raid5 to clear R5_Discard when the complete request is
handled rather than when submitting the per-device discard request.
However it did not clear R5_Discard for the parity device.

This means that if the stripe_head was reused before it expired from
the cache, the setting would be wrong and a hang would result.

Also if the R5_Uptodate bit happens to be set, R5_Discard again
won't be cleared.  But R5_Uptodate really should be clear at this point.

So make sure R5_Discard is cleared in all cases, and clear
R5_Uptodate when a 'discard' completes.
