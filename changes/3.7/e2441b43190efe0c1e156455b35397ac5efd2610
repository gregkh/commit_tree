UBIFS: remove __DATE__ and __TIME__

This tag is useless and it breaks automatic builds. It causes rebuilds
for packages that depend on kernel for no real reason.

Further, quoting Michal, who removed most of the users already:
The kernel already prints its build timestamp during boot, no need to
repeat it in random drivers and produce different object files each
time.
