ipv4: add a fib_type to fib_info

commit d2d68ba9fe8 (ipv4: Cache input routes in fib_info nexthops.)
introduced a regression for forwarding.

This was hard to reproduce but the symptom was that packets were
delivered to local host instead of being forwarded.

David suggested to add fib_type to fib_info so that we dont
inadvertently share same fib_info for different purposes.

With help from Julian Anastasov who provided very helpful
hints, reproduced here :

        Can it be a problem related to fib_info reuse
from different routes. For example, when local IP address
is created for subnet we have:

broadcast 192.168.0.255 dev DEV  proto kernel  scope link  src
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.0/24 dev DEV  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.1
local 192.168.0.1 dev DEV  proto kernel  scope host  src 192.168.0.1

        The "dev DEV  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.1" is
a reused fib_info structure where we put cached routes.
The result can be same fib_info for 192.168.0.255 and
192.168.0.0/24. RTN_BROADCAST is cached only for input
routes. Incoming broadcast to 192.168.0.255 can be cached
and can cause problems for traffic forwarded to 192.168.0.0/24.
So, this patch should solve the problem because it
separates the broadcast from unicast traffic.

        And the ip_route_input_slow caching will work for
local and broadcast input routes (above routes 1 and 3) just
because they differ in scope and use different fib_info.
