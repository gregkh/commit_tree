aoe: do revalidation steps in order

The discovery process begins with an optional AoE config query command and
an AoE config query response.  Normally when an aoe device is already
open, the config query response does not trigger an ATA identify device
command to be sent out, since the response contains storage capacity
information that, if changed, could surprise the user of the device.

The userland "aoe-revalidate" tool uses a character device to trigger an
AoE config query for a particular AoE storage target and an ATA device
identify command, even when the device is open.

This change causes the config query to go out first, reflecting the normal
discovery sequence.  The responses could come back in any order, so this
change is fairly cosmetic.
