mm: compaction: correct the nr_strict va isolated check for CMA

Thierry reported that the "iron out" patch for isolate_freepages_block()
had problems due to the strict check being too strict with "mm:
compaction: Iron out isolate_freepages_block() and
isolate_freepages_range() -fix1".  It's possible that more pages than
necessary are isolated but the check still fails and I missed that this
fix was not picked up before RC1.  This same problem has been identified
in 3.7-RC1 by Tony Prisk and should be addressed by the following patch.
