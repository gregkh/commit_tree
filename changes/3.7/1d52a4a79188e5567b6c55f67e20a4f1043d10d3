kconfig: document oldnoconfig to what it really does in conf.c

As 67d34a6a391369269a2e5dba8a5f42cc4cd50231 said, the make target
'oldnoconfig' is a misnomer. It doesn't set new symbols to 'n', but
instead sets it to their default values.

This patch fixes the document in conf.c, and will submit another patch
to replace 'oldnoconfig' to 'olddefconfig'
