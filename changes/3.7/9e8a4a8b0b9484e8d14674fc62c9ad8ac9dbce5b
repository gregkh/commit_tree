Btrfs: use flag EXTENT_DEFRAG for snapshot-aware defrag

We're going to use this flag EXTENT_DEFRAG to indicate which range
belongs to defragment so that we can implement snapshow-aware defrag:

We set the EXTENT_DEFRAG flag when dirtying the extents that need
defragmented, so later on writeback thread can differentiate between
normal writeback and writeback started by defragmentation.
