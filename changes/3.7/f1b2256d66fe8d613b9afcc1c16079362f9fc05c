tools lib traceevent: Fix error path on pevent_parse_event

If __pevent_parse_format() succeeded but add_event() failed, 'ret' didn't
have a proper error code.  Set it to PEVENT_ERRNO__MEM_ALLOC_FAILED.

In addition, at that point 'event' also has fields and format
information and they all need to be freed.  Call pevent_free_format() to
handle it.
