xen/mmu: Remove from __ka space PMD entries for pagetables.

Please first read the description in "xen/mmu: Copy and revector the
P2M tree."

At this stage, the __ka address space (which is what the old
P2M tree was using) is partially disassembled. The cleanup_highmap
has removed the PMD entries from 0-16MB and anything past _brk_end
up to the max_pfn_mapped (which is the end of the ramdisk).

The xen_remove_p2m_tree and code around has ripped out the __ka for
the old P2M array.

Here we continue on doing it to where the Xen page-tables were.
It is safe to do it, as the page-tables are addressed using __va.
For good measure we delete anything that is within MODULES_VADDR
and up to the end of the PMD.

At this point the __ka only contains PMD entries for the start
of the kernel up to __brk.

[v1: Per Stefano's suggestion wrapped the MODULES_VADDR in debug]
