MPILIB: Provide a function to read raw data into an MPI

Provide a function to read raw data of a predetermined size into an MPI rather
than expecting the size to be encoded within the data.  The data is assumed to
represent an unsigned integer, and the resulting MPI will be positive.

The function looks like this:

	MPI mpi_read_raw_data(const void *, size_t);

This is useful for reading ASN.1 integer primitives where the length is encoded
in the ASN.1 metadata.
