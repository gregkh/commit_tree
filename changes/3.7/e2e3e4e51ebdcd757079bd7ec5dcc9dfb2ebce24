PM / Domains: Do not measure start time for "irq safe" devices

The genpd_start_dev() routine used by pm_genpd_runtime_resume()
to put "irq safe" devices into the full power state measures the
time necessary to "start" the device and updates its PM QoS timing
data if necessary.  This may lead to a deadlock if the given device
is a clock source and genpd_start_dev() is invoked from within the
clock source's .enable() routine, which will happen if that routine
uses pm_runtime_get_sync(), for example, to ensure that the device
is operational.

For this reason, introduce a special routine analogous to
genpd_start_dev(), called genpd_start_dev_no_timing(), that doesn't
carry out the time measurement, and make pm_genpd_runtime_resume()
use it instead of genpd_start_dev() to power up "irq safe" devices.
