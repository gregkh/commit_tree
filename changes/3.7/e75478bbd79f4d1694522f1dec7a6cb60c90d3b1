video: exynos_dp: replace link_status with link_align to check channel equalization

To check channel equalization, the value of LANE_ALIGN_STATUS_UPDATED is
necessary in exynos_dp_channel_eq_ok(). Also, link_align includes this value.
However, link_status does not include this value, so it makes the problem
that channel equalization is failed during link training.
