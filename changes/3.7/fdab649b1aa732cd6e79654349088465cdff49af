rcu: Remove redundant memory barrier from __call_rcu()

The first memory barrier in __call_rcu() is supposed to order any
updates done beforehand by the caller against the actual queuing
of the callback.  However, the second memory barrier (which is intended
to order incrementing the queue lengths before queuing the callback)
is also between the caller's updates and the queuing of the callback.
The second memory barrier can therefore serve both purposes.

This commit therefore removes the first memory barrier.
