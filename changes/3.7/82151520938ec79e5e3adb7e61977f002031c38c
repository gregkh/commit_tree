perf symbols: Remove unused 'end' arg in kallsyms parse cb

kallsyms__parse() takes a callback that is called on every discovered
symbol. As /proc/kallsyms does not supply symbol sizes, the callback was
simply called with end=start, faking the symbol size to 1.

All of the callbacks (there are 2) used in calls to kallsyms__parse()
are _only_ used as callbacks for kallsyms__parse().

Given that kallsyms__parse() lacks real information about what
end/length should be, don't make up a length in kallsyms__parse().
Instead have the callbacks handle guessing the length.

Also relocate a comment regarding symbol creation to the callback which
does symbol creation (kallsyms__parse() is not in general used to create
symbols).
