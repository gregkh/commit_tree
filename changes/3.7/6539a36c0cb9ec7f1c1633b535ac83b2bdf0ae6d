staging: zsmalloc: s/firstpage/page in new copy map funcs

firstpage already has precedent and meaning the first page
of a zspage.  In the case of the copy mapping functions,
it is the first of a pair of pages needing to be mapped.

This patch just renames the firstpage argument to "page" to
avoid confusion.
