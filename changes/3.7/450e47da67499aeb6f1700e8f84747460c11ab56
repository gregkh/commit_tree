s390/entry: fix svc number for TIF_SYSCALL system call restart

The load of the svc number in the TIF_SYSCALL restart path needs to be
done with an instruction that loads all 64 bits of %r1, 'lh' only loads
32 bits. If the upper half of %r1 is not zero and has the msb set,
entry64.S will try to execute an svc with a really large number.
What will be in the upper half of %r1 depends on the code generated by
gcc for the functions on the do_signal() callchain.
