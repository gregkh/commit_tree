[media] fimc-lite: Don't use mutex_lock_interruptible() in device release()

Use uninterruptible mutex_lock in the release() file op to make
sure all resources are properly freed when a process is being
terminated. Returning -ERESTARTSYS has no effect for a terminating
process and this may cause driver resources not to be released.
This patch is required for stable kernels v3.5+.
