drm/i915: rip out sanitize_pm again

We believe to have squashed all issues around the gen6+ rps interrupt
generation and why the gpu sometimes got stuck. With that cleared up,
there's no user left for the sanitize_pm infrastructure, so let's just
rip it out.

Note that 'intel_reg_write 0xa014 0x13070000' is the w/a if we find
ourselves stuck again.
