mm/sl[aou]b: Do slab aliasing call from common code

The slab aliasing logic causes some strange contortions in slub. So add
a call to deal with aliases to slab_common.c but disable it for other
slab allocators by providng stubs that fail to create aliases.

Full general support for aliases will require additional cleanup passes
and more standardization of fields in kmem_cache.
