serial_core: Update buffer overrun statistics.

Currently, serial drivers don't report buffer overruns. When a buffer overrun
occurs, tty_insert_flip_char returns 0, and no attempt is made to insert that
same character again (i.e. it is lost). This patch reports buffer overruns via
the buf_overrun field in the port's icount structure.
