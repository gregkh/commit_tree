oprofile: Remove 'WQ on CPUx, prefer CPUy' warning

Under certain workloads we see the following warnings:

 WQ on CPU0, prefer CPU1
 WQ on CPU0, prefer CPU2
 WQ on CPU0, prefer CPU3

It warns the user that the wq to access a per-cpu buffers runs not on
the same cpu. This happens if the wq is rescheduled on a different cpu
than where the buffer is located. This was probably implemented to
detect performance issues. Not sure if there actually is one as the
buffers are copied to a single buffer anyway which should be the
actual bottleneck.

We wont change WQ implementation. Since a user can do nothing the
warning is pointless. Removing it.
