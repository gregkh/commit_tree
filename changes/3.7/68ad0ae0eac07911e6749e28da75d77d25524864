staging: comedi: s626: remove 'allocatedBuf' from private data

This variable is only used to count the number of dma buffers
allocated during the attach. If an allocation fails, the attach
function exits with -ENOMEM. When this variable is checked later
it will always be == 2. Just remove the variable and the check.

This allows bringing the code back an indent level in
s626_initialize(). Note, coding style issues in this function
are not addressed yet.
