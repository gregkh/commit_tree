x86_64: Work around old GAS bug

GAS in binutils(2.16.91) could not parse parentheses within
macro parameters unless fully parenthesized, and this is a
workaround to make old gas work without generating below errors:

 arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S: Assembler messages:
 arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S:387: Error: too many positional arguments
 arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S:389: Error: too many positional arguments

[ Jan argues that these old GAS versions are fragile - which is so, but lets give them a chance. ]
