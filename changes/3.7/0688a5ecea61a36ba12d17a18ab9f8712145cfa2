GFS2: Stop block extents at the end of bitmaps

This patch stops multiple block allocations if a nonzero
return code is received from gfs2_rbm_from_block. Without
this patch, if enough pressure is put on the file system,
you get a kernel warning quickly followed by:
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at (null)
IP: [<ffffffffa04f47e8>] gfs2_alloc_blocks+0x2c8/0x880 [gfs2]
With this patch, things run normally.
