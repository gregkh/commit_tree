drm/i915: fixup up debugfs rps state handling

- Take the dev->struct_mutex around access the corresponding state
  (and adjusting the rps hw state).
- Add an assert to gen6_set_rps to ensure we don't forget about this
  in the future.
- Don't set up the min/max_freq files if it doesn't apply to the hw.
  And do the same for the gen6+ cache sharing file while at it.

v2: Move the gen6+ checks into the read/write callbacks. Thanks to the
awesome drm midlayer we can't check that when registering the debugfs
files, because the driver is not yet fully set up, specifically the
->load callback hasn't run yet.

Oh how I despise this disaster ...

v3: Also add a WARN_ON(mutex_is_locked) in set_rps to check the
locking.

v4: Use mutex_lock_interruptible, suggested by Chris Wilson.
