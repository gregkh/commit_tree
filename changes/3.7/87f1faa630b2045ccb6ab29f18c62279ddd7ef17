drm/i915: move output commit and crtc disabling into set_mode

It's rather pointless to compute crtc->enabled twice right away ;-)

The only thing we really have to be careful about is that we frob the
dpms state only after a successful modeset and when we've actually
haven't just disabled the crtc.

Hooray for convoluted interfaces ...
