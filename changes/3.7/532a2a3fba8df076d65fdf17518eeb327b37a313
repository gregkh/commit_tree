md: raid 10 supports TRIM


This makes md raid 10 support TRIM.

If one disk supports discard and another not, or one has
discard_zero_data and another not, there could be inconsistent between
data from such disks. But this should not matter, discarded data is
useless. This will add extra copy in rebuild though.
