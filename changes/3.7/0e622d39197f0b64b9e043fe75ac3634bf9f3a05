of/address: sparc: Declare of_iomap as an extern function for sparc again

This bug-fix makes sure that of_iomap is defined extern for sparc so that the
sparc-specific implementation of_iomap is once again used when including
include/linux/of_address.h in a sparc context. OF_GPIO that is now available for
sparc relies on this.

The bug was inadvertently introduced in a850a75, "of/address: add empty static
inlines for !CONFIG_OF", that added a static dummy inline for of_iomap when
!CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS. However, CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS is never defined for sparc, but
there is a sparc-specific implementation /arch/sparc/kernel/of_device_common.c.

This fix takes the same approach as 0bce04b that solved the equivalent problem
for of_address_to_resource.
