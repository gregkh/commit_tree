xHCI: add cmd_ring_state

Adding cmd_ring_state for command ring. It helps to verify
the current command ring state for controlling the command
ring operations.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0.  The commit
7ed603ecf8b68ab81f4c83097d3063d43ec73bb8 "xhci: Add an assertion to
check for virt_dev=0 bug." papers over the NULL pointer dereference that
I now believe is related to a timed out Set Address command.  This (and
the four patches that follow it) contain the real fix that also allows
VIA USB 3.0 hubs to consistently re-enumerate during the plug/unplug
stress tests.
