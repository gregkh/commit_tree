i2c: omap: simplify num_bytes handling

trivial patch, no functional changes

If the fifo is disabled or fifo_size is 0 the num_bytes
is set to 1. Else it is set to fifo_size or in case of a
draining interrupt the remaining bytes in the buff stat.
So the zero check is redundant and can be safely optimised.
