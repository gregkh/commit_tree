xHCI: cancel command after command timeout

The patch is used to cancel command when the command isn't
acknowledged and a timeout occurs.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contain
the commit 7ed603ecf8b68ab81f4c83097d3063d43ec73bb8 "xhci: Add an
assertion to check for virt_dev=0 bug." That commit papers over a NULL
pointer dereference, and this patch fixes the underlying issue that
caused the NULL pointer dereference.
