crypto: cleanup - remove unneeded crypto_alg.cra_list initializations

Initialization of cra_list is currently mixed, most ciphers initialize this
field and most shashes do not. Initialization however is not needed at all
since cra_list is initialized/overwritten in __crypto_register_alg() with
list_add(). Therefore perform cleanup to remove all unneeded initializations
of this field in 'crypto/'.
