ARM: Add fixed PCI i/o mapping

This adds a fixed virtual mapping for PCI i/o addresses. The mapping is
located at the last 2MB of vmalloc region (0xfee00000-0xff000000). 2MB
is used to align with PMD size, but IO_SPACE_LIMIT is 1MB. The space
is reserved after .map_io and can be mapped at any time later with
pci_ioremap_io. Platforms which need early i/o mapping (e.g. for vga
console) can call pci_map_io_early in their .map_io function.

This has changed completely from the 1st implementation which only
supported creating the static mapping at .map_io.
