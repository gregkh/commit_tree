cxgb4: Fix initialization of SGE_CONTROL register

INGPADBOUNDARY_MASK is already shifted. No need to shift it again. On reloading
a driver it was resulting in a bad SGE FL MTU sizes [1536, 9088] error. This
only causes an issue on systems that have L1 cache size of 32B, 128B, 512B,
2048B or 4096B.
