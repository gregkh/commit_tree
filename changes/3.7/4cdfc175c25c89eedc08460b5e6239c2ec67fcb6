rcu: Move quiescent-state forcing into kthread

As the first step towards allowing quiescent-state forcing to be
preemptible, this commit moves RCU quiescent-state forcing into the
same kthread that is now used to initialize and clean up after grace
periods.  This is yet another step towards keeping scheduling
latency down to a dull roar.

Updated to change from raw_spin_lock_irqsave() to raw_spin_lock_irq()
and to remove the now-unused rcu_state structure fields as suggested by
Peter Zijlstra.
