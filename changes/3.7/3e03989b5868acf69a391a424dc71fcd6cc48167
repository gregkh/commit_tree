target: Avoid integer overflow in se_dev_align_max_sectors()

The expression (max_sectors * block_size) might overflow a u32
(indeed, since iblock sets max_hw_sectors to UINT_MAX, it is
guaranteed to overflow and end up with a much-too-small result in many
common cases).  Fix this by doing an equivalent calculation that
doesn't require multiplication.

While we're touching this code, avoid splitting a printk format across
two lines and use pr_info(...) instead of printk(KERN_INFO ...).
