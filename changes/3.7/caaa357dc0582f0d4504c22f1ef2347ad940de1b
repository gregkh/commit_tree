Input: Add KD[GS]KBDIACRUC ioctls to the compatible list

Allow handling of Unicode compose sequences by 32-bit apps on a 64-bit
system.  The issue has been reported in <http://bugs.debian.org/540534>
and <http://lists.altlinux.org/pipermail/kbd/2009-December/000235.html>.

A formal check of the two affected ioctls in drivers/char/vt_ioctl.c
(introduced in 04c71976) and a test using x86 kbd 1.15.1 on a so patched
x86_64 kernel both confirm that KD[GS]KBDIACRUC are ioctl32()
compatible.
