mm rmap: remove vma_address check for address inside vma

In file and anon rmap, we use interval trees to find potentially relevant
vmas and then call vma_address() to find the virtual address the given
page might be found at in these vmas.  vma_address() used to include a
check that the returned address falls within the limits of the vma, but
this check isn't necessary now that we always use interval trees in rmap:
the interval tree just doesn't return any vmas which this check would find
to be irrelevant.  As a result, we can replace the use of -EFAULT error
code (which then needed to be checked in every call site) with a
VM_BUG_ON().
