thp: merge page pre-alloc in khugepaged_loop into khugepaged_do_scan

There are two pre-alloc operations in these two function, the different is:
- it allows to sleep if page alloc fail in khugepaged_loop
- it exits immediately if page alloc fail in khugepaged_do_scan

Actually, in khugepaged_do_scan, we can allow the pre-alloc to sleep on
the first failure, then the operation in khugepaged_loop can be removed
