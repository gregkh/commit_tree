drm/i915: Remove __GFP_NO_KSWAPD

When I pulled-in today's drm-intel-next into linux-next (next-20120824)
I saw this build-breakage:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c: In function 'i915_gem_object_get_pages_gtt':
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:1778:40: error: '__GFP_NO_KSWAPD' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem.c:1778:40: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in

This is caused by commit ba099ef165f8 ("mm: remove __GFP_NO_KSWAPD")
and commit b6beae2c2014 ("mm: remove __GFP_NO_KSWAPD fixes") in
linux-next (next-20120824).

Fix this by removing __GFP_NO_KSWAPD from drm/i915 driver.
