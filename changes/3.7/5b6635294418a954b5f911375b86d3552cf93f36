powerpc/eeh: Trace EEH state based on PE

Since we've introduced dedicated struct to trace individual PEs,
it's reasonable to trace its state through the dedicated struct
instead of using "eeh_dev" any more.

The patches implements the state tracing based on PE. It's notable
that the PE state will be applied to the specified PE as well as
its child PEs. That complies with the rule that problematic parent
PE will prevent those child PEs from working properly.
