ASoC: omap-pcm: Prepare to configure the DMA data_type based on stream properties

Based on the format of the stream the omap-pcm can decide alone what data
type should be used with by the sDMA.
Keep the possibility for OMAP dai drivers to tell omap-pcm if they want to
use different data type. This is needed for the omap-hdmi for example which
needs 32bit data type even if the stream format is S16_LE.

The check if (dma_data->data_type) is safe at the moment since omap-pcm
does not support 8bit samples (OMAP_DMA_DATA_TYPE_S8 == 0x00).

The next step is to redefine the meaning of dma_data->data_type to unblock
this limitation.
