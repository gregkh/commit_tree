Documentation: Remove 3 byte redundant code at the head of the Documentation/zh_CN/arm/booting

Remove 3 byte redundant code at the head of
the Documentation/zh_CN/arm/booting

When I see the file Documentation/zh_CN/arm/booting using
Bless(binary Viewer),I find 3 byte redundant in it. So I
make a patch to correcting that error made by me.
