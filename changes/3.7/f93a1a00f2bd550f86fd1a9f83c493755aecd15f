MIPS: Fix crash that occurs when function tracing is enabled

A recent patch changed some irq routines from inlines to functions.
These routines are called by the tracer code. Now that they're functions,
if they are compiled for function tracing they will call the tracer
and crash the system due to infinite recursion. The fix disables
tracing in these functions by using "notrace" in the function
definition.
