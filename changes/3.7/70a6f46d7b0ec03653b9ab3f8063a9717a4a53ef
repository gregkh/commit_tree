pstore: Fix NULL pointer dereference in console writes

Passing a NULL id causes a NULL pointer deference in writers such as
erst_writer and efi_pstore_write because they expect to update this id.
Pass a dummy id instead.

This avoids a cascade of oopses caused when the initial
pstore_console_write passes a null which in turn causes writes to the
console causing further oopses in subsequent pstore_console_write calls.
