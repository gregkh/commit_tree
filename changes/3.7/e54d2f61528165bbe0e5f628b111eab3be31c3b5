xen/arm: sync_bitops

sync_bitops functions are equivalent to the SMP implementation of the
original functions, independently from CONFIG_SMP being defined.

We need them because _set_bit etc are not SMP safe if !CONFIG_SMP. But
under Xen you might be communicating with a completely external entity
who might be on another CPU (e.g. two uniprocessor guests communicating
via event channels and grant tables). So we need a variant of the bit
ops which are SMP safe even on a UP kernel.
