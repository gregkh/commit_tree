GFS2: rbm code cleanup

This patch fixes a few small rbm related things. First, it fixes
a corner case where the rbm needs to switch bitmaps and wasn't
adjusting its buffer pointer. Second, there's a white space issue
fixed. Third, the logic in function gfs2_rbm_from_block was optimized
a bit. Lastly, a check for goal block overflows was added to function
gfs2_alloc_blocks.
