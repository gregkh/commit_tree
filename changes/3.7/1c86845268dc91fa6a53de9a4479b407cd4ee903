ALSA: hda - Add 3stack-automute model to AD1882 codec

Added a simple support of automute for the front HP jack to AD1882
stack model.  Such an addition is basically an exception -- we really
want to avoid the static quirk codes, but AD1882 parser isn't still
ready for moving to the BIOS auto-parser yet.  So, as a quick fix, I
merged it for now.

In near future, we really need the big clean up of patch_analog.c to
move on to the auto-parser...
