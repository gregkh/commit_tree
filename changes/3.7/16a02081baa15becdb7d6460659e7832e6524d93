TTY: move allocations to tty_alloc_driver

So now, that we have flags and know everything needed, keep a promise
and move all the tables and ports allocation from tty_register_driver
to tty_alloc_driver.

Not only that it makes sense, but we need this for
tty_port_link_device which needs tty_driver->ports but is to be called
before tty_register_driver.
