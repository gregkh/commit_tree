ARM: 7538/1: delay: add registration mechanism for delay timer sources

The current timer-based delay loop relies on the architected timer to
initiate the switch away from the polling-based implementation. This is
unfortunate for platforms without the architected timers but with a
suitable delay source (that is, constant frequency, always powered-up
and ticking as long as the CPUs are online).

This patch introduces a registration mechanism for the delay timer
(which provides an unconditional read_current_timer implementation) and
updates the architected timer code to use the new interface.
