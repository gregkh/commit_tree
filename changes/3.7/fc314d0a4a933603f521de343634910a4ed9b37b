tools/testing/selftests/epoll/test_epoll.c: fix build

Latest Linus head run of "make selftests" in the tools directory failed
with references to undefined variables.  Reference was to
'write_thread_data' which is the name of a struct that is being used, not
the variable itself.  Change reference so it points to the variable.
