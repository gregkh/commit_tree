Bluetooth: mgmt: Implement support for passkey notification

This patch adds support for Secure Simple Pairing with devices that have
KeyboardOnly as their IO capability. Such devices will cause a passkey
notification on our side and optionally also keypress notifications.
Without this patch some keyboards cannot be paired using the mgmt
interface.
