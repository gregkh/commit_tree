rbd: support data returned from OSD methods

An OSD object method call can be made using rbd_req_sync_exec().
Until now this has only been used for creating a new RBD snapshot,
and that has only required sending data out, not receiving anything
back from the OSD.

We will now need to get data back from an OSD on a method call, so
add parameters to rbd_req_sync_exec() that allow a buffer into which
returned data should be placed to be specified, along with its size.

Previously, rbd_req_sync_exec() passed a null pointer and zero
size to rbd_req_sync_op(); change this so the new inbound buffer
information is provided instead.

Rename the "buf" and "len" parameters in rbd_req_sync_op() to
make it more obvious they are describing inbound data.
