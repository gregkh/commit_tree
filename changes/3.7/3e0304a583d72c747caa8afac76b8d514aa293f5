netfilter: ipset: Support to match elements marked with "nomatch"

Exceptions can now be matched and we can branch according to the
possible cases:

a. match in the set if the element is not flagged as "nomatch"
b. match in the set if the element is flagged with "nomatch"
c. no match

i.e.

iptables ... -m set --match-set ... -j ...
iptables ... -m set --match-set ... --nomatch-entries -j ...
...
