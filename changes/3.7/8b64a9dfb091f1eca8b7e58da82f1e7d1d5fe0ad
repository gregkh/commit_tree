powerpc/booke64: Use SPRG0/3 scratch for bolted TLB miss & crit int

Embedded.Hypervisor category defines GSPRG0..3 physical registers for guests.
Avoid SPRG4-7 usage as scratch in host exception handlers, otherwise guest
SPRG4-7 registers will be clobbered.
For bolted TLB miss exception handlers, which is the version currently
supported by KVM, use SPRN_SPRG_GEN_SCRATCH aka SPRG0 instead of
SPRN_SPRG_TLB_SCRATCH aka SPRG6. Keep using TLB PACA slots to fit in one
64-byte cache line.
For critical exception handlers use SPRG3 instead of SPRG7. Provide a routine
to store and restore user-visible SPRGs. This will be subsequently used
to restore VDSO information in SPRG3. Add EX_R13 to paca slots to free up
SPRG3 and change the critical exception epilog to use it.
