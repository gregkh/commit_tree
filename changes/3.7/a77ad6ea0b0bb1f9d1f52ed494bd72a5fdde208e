X.509: Implement simple static OID registry

Implement a simple static OID registry that allows the mapping of an encoded
OID to an enum value for ease of use.

The OID registry index enum appears in the:

	linux/oid_registry.h

header file.  A script generates the registry from lines in the header file
that look like:

	<sp*>OID_foo,<sp*>/*<sp*>1.2.3.4<sp*>*/

The actual OID is taken to be represented by the numbers with interpolated
dots in the comment.

All other lines in the header are ignored.

The registry is queries by calling:

	OID look_up_oid(const void *data, size_t datasize);

This returns a number from the registry enum representing the OID if found or
OID__NR if not.
