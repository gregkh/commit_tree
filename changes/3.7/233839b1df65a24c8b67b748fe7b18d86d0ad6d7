CIFS: Fix fast lease break after open problem

Now we walk though cifsFileInfo's list for every incoming lease
break and look for an equivalent there. That approach misses lease
breaks that come just after an open response - we don't have time
to populate new cifsFileInfo structure to the list. Fix this by
adding new list of pending opens and look for a lease there if we
didn't find it in the list of cifsFileInfo structures.
