GFS2: Fix infinite loop in rbm_find

This patch fixes an infinite loop in gfs2_rbm_find that was introduced
by the previous patch. The problem occurred when the length was less
than 3 but the rbm block was byte-aligned, causing it to improperly
return a extent length of zero, which caused it to spin.
