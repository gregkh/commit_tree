powerpc/crypto: add 842 crypto driver

This patch add the 842 cryptographic API driver that
submits compression requests to the 842 hardware compression
accelerator driver (nx-compress).

If the hardware accelerator goes offline for any reason
(dynamic disable, migration, etc...), this driver will use LZO
as a software failover for all future compression requests.
For decompression requests, the 842 hardware driver contains
a software implementation of the 842 decompressor to support
the decompression of data that was compressed before the accelerator
went offline.
