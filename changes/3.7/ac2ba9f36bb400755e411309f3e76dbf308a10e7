perf tools: Catch event names from command line

Use command line string provided by the -e option to name events. This
way we get unique events names that also support pmu event syntax
(<pmu_name>/<config>/<modifier>). No need to reconstruct the name
anymore from its attributes. We use the event_desc of the header to
store the name in the perf.data header. Thus it is also available for
perf report.

Implemented by putting the parser in different states to parse events or
configs.

And since event names are now generated from the command line
specification.  Update event names in test cases accordingly.
