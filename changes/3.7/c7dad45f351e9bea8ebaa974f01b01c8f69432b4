ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: Add debugss HWMOD data

To enable PMU with runtime PM support on OMAP3 devices we need to be able to
dynamically enable and disable the debug sub-system at runtime. By adding HWMOD
data for the debug sub-system for OMAP3, we can build the PMU device using the
debug sub-system HWMOD and control this power domain using runtime PM.
