KVM: VMX: Use kvm_segment to save protected-mode segments when entering realmode

Instead of using struct kvm_save_segment, use struct kvm_segment, which is what
the other APIs use.  This leads to some simplification.

We replace save_rmode_seg() with a call to vmx_save_segment().  Since this depends
on rmode.vm86_active, we move the call to before setting the flag.
