Btrfs: use a slab for ordered extents allocation

The ordered extent allocation is in the fast path of the IO, so use a slab
to improve the speed of the allocation.

 "Size of the struct is 280, so this will fall into the size-512 bucket,
  giving 8 objects per page, while own slab will pack 14 objects into a page.

  Another benefit I see is to check for leaked objects when the module is
  removed (and the cache destroy takes place)."
