timekeeping: Add suspend and resume of clock event devices

Some clock event devices, for example such that belong to PM domains,
need to be handled in a spcial way during the timekeeping suspend
and resume (which takes place in the system core, or "syscore",
stages of system power transitions) in analogy with clock sources.

Introduce .suspend() and .resume() callbacks for clock event devices
that will be executed by timekeeping_suspend/_resume(), respectively,
next the the clock sources' .suspend() and .resume() callbacks.
