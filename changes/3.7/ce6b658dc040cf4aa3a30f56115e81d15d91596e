gpio: davinci: preparation for switch to common clock framework

As a first step towards migrating davinci platforms to use common clock
framework, replace all instances of clk_enable() with clk_prepare_enable()
and clk_disable() with clk_disable_unprepare(). Until the platform is
switched to use the CONFIG_HAVE_CLK_PREPARE Kconfig variable, this just
adds a might_sleep() call and would work without any issues.

This will make it easy later to switch to common clk based implementation
of clk driver from DaVinci specific driver.
