MIPS: perf: Change the "mips_perf_event" table unsupported indicator.

Change the indicator from 0xffffffff in the "event_id" member to
zero in the "cntr_mask" member. This removes the need to initialize
entries that are unsupported. This also solves a problem where the
number of entries in the table was increased based on a globel enum
used for all platforms, but the new unsupported entries were not added
for mips. This was leaving new table entries of all zeros that we not
marked UNSUPPORTED.
