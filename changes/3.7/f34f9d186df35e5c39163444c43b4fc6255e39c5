coredump: prevent double-free on an error path in core dumper

In !CORE_DUMP_USE_REGSET case, if elf_note_info_init fails to allocate
memory for info->fields, it frees already allocated stuff and returns
error to its caller, fill_note_info.  Which in turn returns error to its
caller, elf_core_dump.  Which jumps to cleanup label and calls
free_note_info, which will happily try to free all info->fields again.
BOOM.

This is the fix.
