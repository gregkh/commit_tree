pstore/ram: Mark ramoops_pstore_write_buf() as notrace

write_buf() should be marked as notrace, otherwise it is prone to
recursion.

Though, yet the issue is never triggered in real life, because we run
inside the function tracer, where ftrace does its own recurse protection.

But it's still no good, plus soon we might switch to our own tracer ops,
and then the issue will be fatal. So, let's fix it.
