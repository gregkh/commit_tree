dm thin: support discard with non power of two block size

Support discards when the pool's block size is not a power of 2.
The block layer assumes discard_granularity is a power of 2 (in
blkdev_issue_discard), so we set this to the largest power of 2 that is
a divides into the number of sectors in each block, but never less than
DATA_DEV_BLOCK_SIZE_MIN_SECTORS.

This patch eliminates the "Discard support must be disabled when the
block size is not a power of 2" constraint that was imposed in commit
55f2b8b ("dm thin: support for non power of 2 pool blocksize").  That
commit was incomplete: using a block size that is not a power of 2
shouldn't mean disabling discard support on the device completely.
