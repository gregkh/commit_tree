vfs: move ima_file_free before releasing the file

ima_file_free(), called on __fput(), currently flags files that have
changed, so that the file is re-measured.  For appraising a files's
integrity, the file's hash must be re-calculated and stored in the
'security.ima' xattr to reflect any changes.

This patch moves the ima_file_free() call to before releasing the file
in preparation of ima-appraisal measuring the file and updating the
'security.ima' xattr.
