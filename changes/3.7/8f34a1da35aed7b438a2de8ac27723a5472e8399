arm64: ptrace: use HW_BREAKPOINT_EMPTY type for disabled breakpoints

If a debugger tries to zero a hardware debug control register, the
kernel will try to infer both the type and length of the breakpoint
in order to sanity-check against the requested regset type. This will
fail because the encoding will appear as a zero-length breakpoint.

This patch changes the control register setting so that disabled
breakpoints are treated as HW_BREAKPOINT_EMPTY and no further
sanity-checking is required.
