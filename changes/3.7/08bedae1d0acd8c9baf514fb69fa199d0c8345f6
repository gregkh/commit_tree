sched: Fix load avg vs. cpu-hotplug

Commit f319da0c68 ("sched: Fix load avg vs cpu-hotplug") was an
incomplete fix:

In particular, the problem is that at the point it calls
calc_load_migrate() nr_running := 1 (the stopper thread), so move the
call to CPU_DEAD where we're sure that nr_running := 0.

Also note that we can call calc_load_migrate() without serialization, we
know the state of rq is stable since its cpu is dead, and we modify the
global state using appropriate atomic ops.
