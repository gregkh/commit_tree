[media] rtl28xxu: correct usb_clear_halt() usage

It is not allowed to call usb_clear_halt() after urbs are submitted.
That causes oops sometimes. Move whole streaming_ctrl() logic to
power_ctrl() in order to avoid wrong usb_clear_halt() use. Also,
configuring streaming endpoint in streaming_ctrl() sounds like a
little bit wrong as it is aimed for control stream gate.
