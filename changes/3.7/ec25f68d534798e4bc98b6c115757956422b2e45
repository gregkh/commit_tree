[media] media: coda: allocate internal framebuffers separately from v4l2 buffers

Some codecs running on CODA need internal framebuffers for reference and
reconstructed frames. Allocate them separately, and do not use the input
vb2_buffers: those will be handed off to userspace regularly, and there
is no way to signal to the CODA which of the registered framebuffers are
off limits. As a consequence, userspace is now free to choose the number
of v4l2 buffers.
This patch also includes the code to set up the parameter buffer for
CODA7 and above with 64-bit AXI bus width.
