xen/arm: Fix compile errors when drivers are compiled as modules (export more).

The commit 911dec0db4de6ccc544178a8ddaf9cec0a11d533
"xen/arm: Fix compile errors when drivers are compiled as modules." exports
the neccessary functions. But to guard ourselves against out-of-tree modules
and future drivers hitting this, lets export all of the relevant
hypercalls.
