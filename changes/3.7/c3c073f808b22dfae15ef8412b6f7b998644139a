new helper: iterate_fd()

iterates through the opened files in given descriptor table,
calling a supplied function; we stop once non-zero is returned.
Callback gets struct file *, descriptor number and const void *
argument passed to iterator.  It is called with files->file_lock
held, so it is not allowed to block.

tty_io, netprio_cgroup and selinux flush_unauthorized_files()
converted to its use.
