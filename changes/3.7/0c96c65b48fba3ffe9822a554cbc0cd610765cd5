    drm/i915/dp: Dither down to 6bpc if it makes the mode fit

stores the INTEL_MODE_DP_FORCE_6BPC flag in the private_flags of the
adjusted mode, while i9xx_crtc_mode_set() and ironlake_crtc_mode_set() use
the original mode, without the flag, so it would never have any
effect. However, the BPC was clamped by VBT settings, making things work by
coincidence, until that part was removed in

Use adjusted_mode instead of mode when checking for
INTEL_MODE_DP_FORCE_6BPC to make the flag have effect.

v2: Don't forget to fix this in i9xx_crtc_mode_set() also, pointed out by
Daniel both before and after sending the first patch.
