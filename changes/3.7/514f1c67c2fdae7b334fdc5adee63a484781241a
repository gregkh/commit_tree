perf trace: New tool

Initially should look loosely like the venerable 'strace' tool, but
using the infrastructure in the perf tools to allow tracing extra
targets:

  [acme@sandy linux]$ perf trace --hell
  Error: unknown option `hell'

   usage: perf trace <PID>

      -p, --pid <pid>       trace events on existing process id
          --tid <tid>       trace events on existing thread id
          --all-cpus        system-wide collection from all CPUs
          --cpu <cpu>       list of cpus to monitor
          --no-inherit      child tasks do not inherit counters
          --mmap-pages <n>  number of mmap data pages
          --uid <user>      user to profile

  [acme@sandy linux]$

Those should have the same semantics as when using with 'perf record'.

It gets stuck sometimes, but hey, it works sometimes too!

In time it should support perf.data based workloads, i.e. it should have
a:
	-o filename

Command line option that will produce a perf.data file that can then be
used with 'perf trace' or any of the other perf tools (script, report,
etc).

It will also eventually have the set of functionalities described in the
previous 'trace' prototype by Thomas Gleixner:

   "Announcing a new utility: 'trace'"

Also planned is to have some of the features suggested in the comments
of that LWN article.
