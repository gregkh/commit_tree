workqueue: use mod_delayed_work() instead of __cancel + queue

Now that mod_delayed_work() is safe to call from IRQ handlers,
__cancel_delayed_work() followed by queue_delayed_work() can be
replaced with mod_delayed_work().

Most conversions are straight-forward except for the following.

* net/core/link_watch.c: linkwatch_schedule_work() was doing a quite
  elaborate dancing around its delayed_work.  Collapse it such that
  linkwatch_work is queued for immediate execution if LW_URGENT and
  existing timer is kept otherwise.
