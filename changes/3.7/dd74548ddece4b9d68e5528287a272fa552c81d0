i2c: omap: resize fifos before each message

This patch will try to avoid the usage of
draining feature by reconfiguring the FIFO
the start condition of each message based
on the message's size.

By doing that, we will be better utilizing
the FIFO when doing big transfers.

While at that also drop the now unneeded
check for dev->buf_len as we always know
the amount of data to be transmitted.
