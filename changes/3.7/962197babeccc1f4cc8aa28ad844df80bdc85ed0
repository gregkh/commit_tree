Btrfs: fix unnecessary warning when the fragments make the space alloc fail

When we wrote some data by compress mode into a btrfs filesystem which was full
of the fragments, the kernel will report:
	BTRFS warning (device xxx): Aborting unused transaction.

The reason is:
We can not find a long enough free space to store the compressed data because
of the fragmentary free space, and the compressed data can not be splited,
so the kernel outputed the above message.

In fact, btrfs can deal with this problem very well: it fall back to
uncompressed IO, split the uncompressed data into small ones, and then
store them into to the fragmentary free space. So we shouldn't output the
above warning message.
