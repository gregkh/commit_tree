drm/i915: add tons of modeset state checks

... let's see whether this catches anything earlier and I can track
down a few bugs.

v2: Add more checks and also add DRM_DEBUG_KMS output so that it's
clear which connector/encoder/crtc is being checked atm. Which proved
rather useful for debugging ...

v3: Add a WARN in the common encoder dpms function, now that also
modeset changes properly update the dpms state ...

v4: Properly add a short explanation for each WARN, to avoid the need
to correlate dmesg lines with source lines accurately. Suggested by
Chris Wilson.

v5: Also dump (expected, found) for state checks (or wherever it's not
apparent from the test what exactly mismatches with expectations).
Again suggested by Chris Wilson.

v6: Due to an issue reported by Paulo Zanoni I've noticed that the
encoder checking is by far not as strict as it could and should be.
Improve this.
