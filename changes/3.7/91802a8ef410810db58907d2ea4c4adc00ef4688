ARM: pass -marm to gcc by default for both C and assembler

The Linaro cross toolchain and probably others nowadays default to
building in THUMB2 mode. When building a kernel for a CPU that does
not support THUMB2, the compiler complains about incorrect flags.
We can work around this by setting -marm for all non-T2 builds.

-marm was passed unconditionally for C files previously, but nothing was
passed to the gcc frontend when processing .S files, resulting in a
warning.  The assembler never defaults to ARM unless -Wa,-mthumb is
supplied explicitly, so the files were still assembled correctly.

This patch makes sure that -marm is passed for .S files too, and also
avoids the redundant gcc -marm -mthumb in Thumb kernels.

Without this patch, building assabet_defconfig results in:

usr/initramfs_data.S:1:0: warning: target CPU does not support THUMB instructions [enabled by default]
arch/arm/nwfpe/entry.S:1:0: warning: target CPU does not support THUMB instructions [enabled by default]
firmware/cis/PCMLM28.cis.gen.S:1:0: warning: target CPU does not support THUMB instructions [enabled by default]
(and many more)
