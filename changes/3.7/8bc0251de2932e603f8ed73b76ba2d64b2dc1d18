PM / Domains: Add power-on function using names to identify domains

It sometimes is necessary to turn on a given PM domain when only
the name of it is known and the domain pointer is not readily
available.  For this reason, add a new helper function,
pm_genpd_name_poweron(), allowing the caller to turn on a PM domain
using its name for identification.  To avoid code duplication,
move the domain lookup code to a separate function.
