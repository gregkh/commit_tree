firmware loader: cancel uncache work before caching firmware

Under 'Opportunistic sleep' situation, system sleep might be
triggered very frequently, so the uncahce work may not be completed
before caching firmware during next suspend.

This patch cancels the uncache work before caching firmware to
fix the problem above.

Also this patch optimizes the cacheing firmware mechanism a bit by
only storing one firmware cache entry for one firmware image.

So if the firmware is still cached during suspend, it doesn't need
to be loaded from user space any more.
