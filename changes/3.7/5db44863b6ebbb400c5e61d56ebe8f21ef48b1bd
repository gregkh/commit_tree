[SCSI] sd: Implement support for WRITE SAME

Implement support for WRITE SAME(10) and WRITE SAME(16) in the SCSI disk
driver.

 - We set the default maximum to 0xFFFF because there are several
   devices out there that only support two-byte block counts even with
   WRITE SAME(16). We only enable transfers bigger than 0xFFFF if the
   device explicitly reports MAXIMUM WRITE SAME LENGTH in the BLOCK
   LIMITS VPD.

 - max_write_same_blocks can be overriden per-device basis in sysfs.

 - The UNMAP discovery heuristics remain unchanged but the discard
   limits are tweaked to match the "real" WRITE SAME commands.

 - In the error handling logic we now distinguish between WRITE SAME
   with and without UNMAP set.

The discovery process heuristics are:

 - If the device reports a SCSI level of SPC-3 or greater we'll issue
   READ SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES to find out whether WRITE SAME(16) is
   supported. If that's the case we will use it.

 - If the device supports the block limits VPD and reports a MAXIMUM
   WRITE SAME LENGTH bigger than 0xFFFF we will use WRITE SAME(16).

 - Otherwise we will use WRITE SAME(10) unless the target LBA is beyond
   0xFFFFFFFF or the block count exceeds 0xFFFF.

 - no_write_same is set for ATA, FireWire and USB.
