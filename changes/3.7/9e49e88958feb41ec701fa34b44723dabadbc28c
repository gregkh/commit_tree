filter: add XOR instruction for use with X/K

SKF_AD_ALU_XOR_X has been added a while ago, but as an 'ancillary'
operation that is invoked through a negative offset in K within BPF
load operations. Since BPF_MOD has recently been added, BPF_XOR should
also be part of the common ALU operations. Removing SKF_AD_ALU_XOR_X
might not be an option since this is exposed to user space.
