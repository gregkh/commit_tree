tracing: Add an option for disabling markers

In our application, we have trace markers spread through user-space.
We have markers in GL, X, etc. These are super handy for Chrome's
about:tracing feature (Chrome + system + kernel trace view), but
can be very distracting when you're trying to debug a kernel issue.

I normally, use "grep -v tracing_mark_write" but it would be nice
if I could just temporarily disable markers all together.
