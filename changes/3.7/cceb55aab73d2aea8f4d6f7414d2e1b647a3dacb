uprobes: Introduce copy_opcode(), kill read_opcode()

No functional changes, preparations.

1. Extract the kmap-and-memcpy code from read_opcode() into the
   new trivial helper, copy_opcode(). The next patch will add
   another user.

2. read_opcode() becomes really trivial, fold it into its single
   caller, is_swbp_at_addr().

3. Remove "auprobe" argument from write_opcode(), it is not used
   since f403072c6.
