dmaengine: omap: Add support for pause/resume in cyclic dma mode

The audio stack used omap_stop_dma/omap_start_dma to pause/resume the DMA.
This method has been used for years on OMAP based products.
We only allow pause/resume when the DMA has been configured in cyclic mode
which is used by the audio stack.
