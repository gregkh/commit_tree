ALSA: hda - Remove ignore_misc_bit

The purpose of this flag is unclear. If the problem is that some machines
have broken misc/NO_PRESENCE bits, they should be fixed by pin fixups.

In addition, this causes jack detection functionality to be flawed on
the M31EI, where there are two jacks without jack detection (which is
properly marked as NO_PRESENCE), but due to ignore_misc_bit, these
jacks are instead being reported as being present but always unplugged.
