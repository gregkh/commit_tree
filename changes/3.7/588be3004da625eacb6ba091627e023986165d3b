UAPI: Make arch/sh/include/uapi/asm/hw_breakpoint.h non-empty

arch/sh/include/uapi/asm/hw_breakpoint.h was emitted by the UAPI disintegration
script as an empty file because the parent file had no UAPI stuff in it,
despite being marked with "header-y".

Unfortunately, the patch program deletes resultant empty files when applying a
kernel patch.

So just stick a comment in there as a placeholder.
