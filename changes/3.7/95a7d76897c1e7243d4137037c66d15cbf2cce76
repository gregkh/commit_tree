xen/mmu: Use Xen specific TLB flush instead of the generic one.

As Mukesh explained it, the MMUEXT_TLB_FLUSH_ALL allows the
hypervisor to do a TLB flush on all active vCPUs. If instead
we were using the generic one (which ends up being xen_flush_tlb)
we end up making the MMUEXT_TLB_FLUSH_LOCAL hypercall. But
before we make that hypercall the kernel will IPI all of the
vCPUs (even those that were asleep from the hypervisor
perspective). The end result is that we needlessly wake them
up and do a TLB flush when we can just let the hypervisor
do it correctly.

This patch gives around 50% speed improvement when migrating
idle guest's from one host to another.
