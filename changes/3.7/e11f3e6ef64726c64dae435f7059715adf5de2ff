[media] media: coda: keep track of active instances

Determining the next free instance just by incrementing and decrementing
an instance counter does not work: if there are two instances opened,
0 and 1, and instance 0 is released, the next call to coda_open will
create a new instance with index 1, but instance 1 is already in use.
Instead, scan a bitfield of active instances to determine the first
free instance index.
