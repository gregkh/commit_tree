ARM: dts: AM33XX: Specify reg and interrupt property for all nodes

The device/node resources (like, IORESOURCE_MEM and IORESOURCE_IRQ)
are overwritten by hwmod resources, due to all known reasons but
that should not be the reason for not providing all the information
in the DTS blob. Ideally we should use DTS resource and use HWMOD
framework wherever required and for only specific things.

Newer platforms like, OMAP5 and AM33XX, we only support DT boot mode,
so this patch is preparation for the future where we supposed to get
rid of hwmod dependency anyway.
