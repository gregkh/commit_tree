drm/i915: Replace the pending_gpu_write flag with an explicit seqno

As we always flush the GPU cache prior to emitting the breadcrumb, we no
longer have to worry about the deferred flush causing the
pending_gpu_write to be delayed. So we can instead utilize the known
last_write_seqno to hopefully minimise the wait times.
