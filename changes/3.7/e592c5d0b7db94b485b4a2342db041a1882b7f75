Revert "USB/host: Cleanup unneccessary irq disable code"

This reverts commit 73d4066055e0e2830533041f4b91df8e6e5976ff.

Martin Steigerwald reported that this change caused a hard lockup when
using USB if threadirqs are enabled.  Thomas pointed out that this patch
is incorrect, and can cause problems.  So revert it to get the
previously working functionality back.
