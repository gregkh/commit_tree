ARM: OMAP: convert I2C driver to PM QoS for MPU latency constraints

Convert the driver from the outdated omap_pm_set_max_mpu_wakeup_lat
API to the new PM QoS API.
Since the constraint is on the MPU subsystem, use the PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY
class of PM QoS. The resulting MPU constraints are used by cpuidle to
decide the next power state of the MPU subsystem.

The I2C device latency timing is derived from the FIFO size and the
clock speed and so is applicable to all OMAP SoCs.
