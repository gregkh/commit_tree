x86, suspend: Correct the restore of CR4, EFER; skip computing EFLAGS.ID

The patch:

    73201dbe x86, suspend: On wakeup always initialize cr4 and EFER

... was incorrectly committed in an intermediate (unfinished) form.

- We need to test CF, not ZF, for a bit test with btl.
- We don't actually need to compute the existence of EFLAGS.ID,
  since we set a flag at suspend time if CR4 should be restored.
