ext4: fix online resizing when the # of block groups is constant

Commit 1c6bd7173d66b3 introduced a regression where an online resize
operation which did not change the number of block groups would fail,
i.e:

	mke2fs -t /dev/vdc 60000
	mount /dev/vdc
	resize2fs /dev/vdc 60001

This was due to a bug in the logic regarding when to try converting
the filesystem to use meta_bg.

Also fix up a number of other minor issues with the online resizing
code: (a) Fix a sparse warning; (b) only check to make sure the device
is large enough once, instead of multiple times through the resize
loop.
