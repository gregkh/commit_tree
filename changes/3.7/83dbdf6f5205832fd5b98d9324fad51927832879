[SCSI] qla4xxx: Set IDC version in correct way

Issue:
   Device can go to READY state from COLD and skip INITIALIZATION,
   In this case driver will never set IDC version from function
   qla4_8xxx_device_bootstrap().

Fix:
1. Set IDC version at start of function qla4_82xx_need_reset_handler().
2. Set IDC version only if we are 1st driver to load.
3. Added new function qla4_8xxx_update_idc_reg() to set all idc reg at one
   place.
