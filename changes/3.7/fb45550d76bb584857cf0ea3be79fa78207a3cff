make sure that kernel_thread() callbacks call do_exit() themselves

Most of them never returned anyway - only two functions had to be
changed.  That allows to simplify their callers a whole lot.

Note that this does *not* apply to kthread_run() callbacks - all of
those had been called from the same kernel_thread() callback, which
did do_exit() already.  This is strictly about very few low-level
kernel_thread() callbacks (there are only 6 of those, mostly as part
of kthread.h and kmod.h exported mechanisms, plus kernel_init()
itself).
