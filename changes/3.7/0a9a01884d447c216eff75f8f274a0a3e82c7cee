mlx4: MAD_IFC paravirtualization

The MAD_IFC firmware command fulfills two functions.

First, it is used in the QP0/QP1 MAD-handling flow to obtain
information from the FW (for answering queries), and for setting
variables in the HCA (MAD SET packets).

For this, MAD_IFC should provide the FW (physical) view of the data.
This is the view that OpenSM needs.  We call this the "network view".

In the second case, MAD_IFC is used by various verbs to obtain data
regarding the local HCA (e.g., ib_query_device()).  We call this the
"host view".

This data needs to be paravirtualized.

MAD_IFC therefore needs a wrapper function, and also needs another
flag indicating whether it should provide the network view (when it is
called by ib_process_mad in special-qp packet handling), or the host
view (when it is called while implementing a verb).

There are currently 2 flag parameters in mlx4_MAD_IFC already:
ignore_bkey and ignore_mkey.  These two parameters are replaced by a
single "mad_ifc_flags" parameter, with different bits set for each
flag.  A third flag is added: "network-view/host-view".
