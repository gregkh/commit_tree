ipv6: release reference of ip6_null_entry's dst entry in __ip6_del_rt

as we hold dst_entry before we call __ip6_del_rt,
so we should alse call dst_release not only return
-ENOENT when the rt6_info is ip6_null_entry.

and we already hold the dst entry, so I think it's
safe to call dst_release out of the write-read lock.
