thp: remove assumptions on pgtable_t type

The thp page table pre-allocation code currently assumes that pgtable_t is
of type "struct page *".  This may not be true for all architectures, so
this patch removes that assumption by replacing the functions
prepare_pmd_huge_pte() and get_pmd_huge_pte() with two new functions that
can be defined architecture-specific.

It also removes two VM_BUG_ON checks for page_count() and page_mapcount()
operating on a pgtable_t.  Apart from the VM_BUG_ON removal, there will be
no functional change introduced by this patch.
