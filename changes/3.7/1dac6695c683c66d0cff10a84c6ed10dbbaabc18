ALSA: hda - Allow to pass position_fix=0 explicitly

Set the default value of position_fix -1, and allow user passing
position_fix=0 explicitly to set the "auto" position-fix mode.
Otherwise the auto mode may be switched to others like COMBO of
VIACOMBO when the controller prefers it, thus user can't set the auto
mode any longer.

Also updated the documentation appropriately, too.
