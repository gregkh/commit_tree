rtc: kconfig: fix RTC_INTF defaults connected to RTC_CLASS

Commit 6b8029fab641 ("rtc: kconfig: remove unnecessary dependencies")
removed various 'depends on RTC_CLASS' dependencies but also removed a
few 'default RTC_CLASS' statements, which actually changed default
behavior.

This resulted in the various RTC interfaces (sysfs, proc, dev) all being
disabled by default, even when RTC_CLASS is enabled:

   # CONFIG_RTC_INTF_SYSFS is not set
   # CONFIG_RTC_INTF_PROC is not set
   # CONFIG_RTC_INTF_DEV is not set

which is different from previous behavior (all of these where enabled.)

To fix, add back the 'default RTC_CLASS' statments to each of the
RTC_INTF_* options.

I noticed this because some RTC tests started failing on my TI OMAP
platforms because /dev/rtc0 was not present anymore, even though the
driver was present and RTC_CLASS was enabled.
