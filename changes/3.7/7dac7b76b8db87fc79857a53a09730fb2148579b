batman-adv: Fix potential broadcast BLA-duplicate-check race condition

Threads in the bottom half of batadv_bla_check_bcast_duplist() might
otherwise for instance overwrite variables which other threads might
be using/reading at the same time in the top half, potentially
leading to messing up the bcast_duplist, possibly resulting in false
bridge loop avoidance duplicate check decisions.
