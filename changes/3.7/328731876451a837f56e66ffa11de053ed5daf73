xen/mmu: If the revector fails, don't attempt to revector anything else.

If the P2M revectoring would fail, we would try to continue on by
cleaning the PMD for L1 (PTE) page-tables. The xen_cleanhighmap
is greedy and erases the PMD on both boundaries. Since the P2M
array can share the PMD, we would wipe out part of the __ka
that is still used in the P2M tree to point to P2M leafs.

This fixes it by bypassing the revectoring and continuing on.
If the revector fails, a nice WARN is printed so we can still
troubleshoot this.
