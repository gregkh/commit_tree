aoe: support more AoE addresses with dynamic block device minor numbers

The ATA over Ethernet protocol uses a major (shelf) and minor (slot)
address to identify a particular storage target.  These changes remove an
artificial limitation the aoe driver imposes on the use of AoE addresses.
For example, without these changes, the slot address has a maximum of 15,
but users commonly use slot numbers much greater than that.

The AoE shelf and slot address space is often used sparsely.  Instead of
using a static mapping between AoE addresses and the block device minor
number, the block device minor numbers are now allocated on demand.
