ARM: imx_v6_v7_defconfig: Enable CONFIG_GPIO_MC9S08DZ60

On mx35pdk board there is an 8-bit microcontroller that controls several IOs, such
as backlight enable pin, USB host VBUS, etc.

Let it build by default.

mx35pdk also needs CONFIG_LCD_PLATFORM to be selected to activate the display,
so also make this the default.
