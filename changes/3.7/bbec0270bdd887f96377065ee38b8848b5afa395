blkdev_max_block: make private to fs/buffer.c

We really don't want to look at the block size for the raw block device
accesses in fs/block-dev.c, because it may be changing from under us.
So get rid of the max_block logic entirely, since the caller should
already have done it anyway.

That leaves the only user of this function in fs/buffer.c, so move the
whole function there and make it static.
