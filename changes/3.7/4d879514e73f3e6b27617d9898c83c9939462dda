regmap: Don't lock in regmap_reinit_cache()

When bus->fast_io is set, the locking here is done with spinlocks.
This is currently true for the regmap-mmio bus implementation.

While holding a spinlock we can't go to sleep, various operations
like removing the debugfs entries or re-initializing the cache will
sleep, therefore, shift the locking up to the user.
