delete seven tty headers

Commit 51c9d654c2def97827395a7fbfd0c6f865c26544 ("Staging: delete tty
drivers") left seven headers unused: nothing in the tree includes them
anymore. Two of those headers were still exported, but since nothing in
the kernel actually uses the things those two headers provide, that
seems pointless. Delete these seven tty headers too.
