Yama: handle 32-bit userspace prctl

When running a 64-bit kernel and receiving prctls from a 32-bit
userspace, the "-1" used as an unsigned long will end up being
misdetected. The kernel is looking for 0xffffffffffffffff instead of
0xffffffff. Since prctl lacks a distinct compat interface, Yama needs
to handle this translation itself. As such, support either value as
meaning PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY, to avoid breaking the ABI for 64-bit.
