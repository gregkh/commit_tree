usb: musb: Fix bad call to kfree() in musb_free

Commit 622859634a663c5e55d0e2a2cdbb55ac058d97b3 (usb: musb: drop a
gigantic amount of ifdeferry) included this change:

    @@ -1901,11 +1844,7 @@ static void musb_free(struct musb *musb)
                    dma_controller_destroy(c);

     }

     /*

Since musb comes from struct usb_hcd's hcd_priv, which is allocated on
the end of that struct, kfree'ing it is not going to work.  Replace
kfree(musb) with usb_put_hcd(musb_to_hcd(musb)), which appears to be
the right thing to do here.
