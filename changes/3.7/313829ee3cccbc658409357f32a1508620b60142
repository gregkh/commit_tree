hwmon: (sch56xx-common) Fix build warnings

Fix:
warning: 'address' may be used uninitialized in this function
warning: 'name' may be used uninitialized in this function

While those are false warnings, the patch reduces module size on x86_64 by
approximately 110 bytes, so it is still worth the effort.
