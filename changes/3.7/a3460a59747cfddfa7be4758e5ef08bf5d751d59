new helper: current_pt_regs()

Normally (and that's the default) it's just task_pt_regs(current).
However, if an architecture can optimize that, it can do so by
making a macro of its own available from asm/ptrace.h.  More
importantly, some architectures have task_pt_regs() working only
for traced tasks blocked on signal delivery.  current_pt_regs()
needs to work for *all* processes, so before those architectures
start using stuff relying on current_pt_regs() they'll need a
properly working variant.
