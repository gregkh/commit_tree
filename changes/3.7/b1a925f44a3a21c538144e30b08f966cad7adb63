tty vt: Fix a regression in command line edition

The commit 81732c3b2fede049a692e58a7ceabb6d18ffb18c
("Fix line garbage in virtual console on command line edition")
made a regression with some machines: some characters were not erased
after line edition.

This patch adjusts the number of moved characters and the size of the
region to be updated.
