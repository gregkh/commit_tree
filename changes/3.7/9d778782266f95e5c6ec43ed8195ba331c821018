uprobes: Introduce arch_uprobe_enable/disable_step()

As Oleg pointed out in [0] uprobe should not use the ptrace interface
for enabling/disabling single stepping.

Add the new "__weak arch" helpers which simply call user_*_single_step()
as a preparation. This is only needed to not break the powerpc port, we
will fold this logic into arch_uprobe_pre/post_xol() hooks later.

We should also change handle_singlestep(), _disable_step(&uprobe->arch)
should be called before put_uprobe().
