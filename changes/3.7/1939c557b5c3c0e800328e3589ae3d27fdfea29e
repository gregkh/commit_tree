memcg: trivial fixes for Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt

While reading through Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt, I found a number
of minor wordos and typos.  The patch below is a conservative handling of
some of these: it provides just a number of "obviously correct" fixes to
the English that improve the readability of the document somewhat.
Obviously some more significant fixes need to be made to the document, but
some of those may not be in the "obvious correct" category.
