nbd: add set flags ioctl

Add a set-flags ioctl, allowing various option flags to be set on an nbd
device.  This allows the nbd-client to set the device flags (to enable
read-only mode, or enable discard support, etc.).

Flags are typically specified by the nbd-server.  During the negotiation
phase of the nbd connection, the server sends its flags to the client.
The client then uses NBD_SET_FLAGS to inform the kernel of the options.

Also included is a one-line fix to debug output for the set-timeout ioctl.
