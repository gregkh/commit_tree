HID: remove Paul Walmsley's copyright from places where it shouldn't be

Paul Walmsley has implemented dynamic quirk handling back in 2007 through
commits:

2eb5dc30eb ("USB HID: encapsulate quirk handling into hid-quirks.c")
8222fbe67c ("USB HID: clarify static quirk handling as squirks")
8cef908235 ("USB HID: add support for dynamically-created quirks")
876b9276b9 ("USB HID: add 'quirks' module parameter")

and as such, his copyright rightly belongs to
drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-quirks.c file.

However when generic HID code has been converted to bus and individual
quirks separated out to individual drivers on the bus, the copyright has
been blindly transfered into all the tiny drivers, which actually don't
contain any of Pauls' copyrighted code.

Remove the copyright from those sub-drivers.
