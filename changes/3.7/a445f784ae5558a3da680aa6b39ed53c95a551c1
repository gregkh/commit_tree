JFFS2: fix unmount regression

This patch fixes regression introduced by
"8bdc81c jffs2: get rid of jffs2_sync_super". We submit a delayed work in order
to make sure the write-buffer is synchronized at some point. But we do not
flush it when we unmount, which causes an oops when we unmount the file-system
and then the delayed work is executed.

This patch fixes the issue by adding a "cancel_delayed_work_sync()" infocation
in the '->sync_fs()' handler. This will make sure the delayed work is canceled
on sync, unmount and re-mount. And because VFS always callse 'sync_fs()' before
unmounting or remounting, this fixes the issue.
