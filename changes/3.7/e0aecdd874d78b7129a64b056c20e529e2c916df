workqueue: use irqsafe timer for delayed_work

Up to now, for delayed_works, try_to_grab_pending() couldn't be used
from IRQ handlers because IRQs may happen while
delayed_work_timer_fn() is in progress leading to indefinite -EAGAIN.

This patch makes delayed_work use the new TIMER_IRQSAFE flag for
delayed_work->timer.  This makes try_to_grab_pending() and thus
mod_delayed_work_on() safe to call from IRQ handlers.
