ALSA: usb-audio: Fix mutex deadlock at disconnection

The recent change for USB-audio disconnection race fixes introduced a
mutex deadlock again.  There is a circular dependency between
chip->shutdown_rwsem and pcm->open_mutex, depicted like below, when a
device is opened during the disconnection operation:

A. snd_usb_audio_disconnect() ->
     card.c::register_mutex ->
       chip->shutdown_rwsem (write) ->
         snd_card_disconnect() ->
           pcm.c::register_mutex ->
             pcm->open_mutex

B. snd_pcm_open() ->
     pcm->open_mutex ->
       snd_usb_pcm_open() ->
         chip->shutdown_rwsem (read)

Since the chip->shutdown_rwsem protection in the case A is required
only for turning on the chip->shutdown flag and it doesn't have to be
taken for the whole operation, we can reduce its window in
snd_usb_audio_disconnect().
