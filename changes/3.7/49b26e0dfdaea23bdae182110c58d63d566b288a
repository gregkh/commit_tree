ARM: msm: Remove call to missing FPGA init on 8660

A previous patch[1] added code to initialize an FPGA register on the
8660 "SURF" development platform.  Since this development platform is
not widely available, and there is now a more available device "the
Dragonboard" based on the same core SOC, this change was dropped.

However, the DT code kept a lingering call to this FPGA init function.
Remove it.
