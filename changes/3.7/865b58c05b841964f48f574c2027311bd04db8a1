[SCSI] virtio-scsi: support online resizing of disks

Support the LUN parameter change event.  Currently, the host fires this event
when the capacity of a disk is changed from the virtual machine monitor.
The resize then appears in the kernel log like this:

  sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] 46137344 512-byte logical blocks: (23.6 GB/22.0 GIb)
  sda: detected capacity change from 22548578304 to 23622320128
