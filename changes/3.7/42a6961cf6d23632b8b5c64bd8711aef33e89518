OMAPDSS: Improve fifo management code

OMAP4+ allows assigning the overlay FIFOs freely, but that is not
supported by omapdss yet. This patch takes a step forward by improving
the fifo management to be more flexible.

dispc.c is changed to keep track of the sizes of each fifo, and also the
overlay using each fifo.
