qlogicpti: Fix build warning.

The build warns:

drivers/scsi/qlogicpti.c: In function 'qpti_sbus_probe':
drivers/scsi/qlogicpti.c:1316:45: warning: passing argument 1 of 'scsi_host_alloc' discards 'const' qualifier from pointer target type [enabled by default]
include/scsi/scsi_host.h:778:26: note: expected 'struct scsi_host_template *' but argument is of type 'const struct scsi_host_template *'

The problem is that of_device_id->data is a const void pointer.

This is pretty silly in this specific instance, because for all
matched device IDs we set match->data to the same value,
&qpti_template.

So just use that directly instead of the unnecessary and improperly
typed abstraction.
