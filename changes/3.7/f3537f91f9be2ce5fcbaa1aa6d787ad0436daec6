ASN.1: Fix an indefinite length skip error

Fix an error in asn1_find_indefinite_length() whereby small definite length
elements of size 0x7f are incorrecly classified as non-small.  Without this
fix, an error will be given as the length of the length will be perceived as
being very much greater than the maximum supported size.
