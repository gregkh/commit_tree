x86, cpu: Fixup tlb_flushall_shift formatting

The TLB characteristics appeared like this in dmesg:

[    0.065817] Last level iTLB entries: 4KB 512, 2MB 1024, 4MB 512
[    0.065817] Last level dTLB entries: 4KB 1024, 2MB 1024, 4MB 512
[    0.065817] tlb_flushall_shift is 0xffffffff

where tlb_flushall_shift is actually -1 but dumped as a hex number.
However, the Kconfig option CONFIG_DEBUG_TLBFLUSH and the rest of the
code treats this as a signed decimal and states "If you set it to -1,
the code flushes the whole TLB unconditionally."

So, fix its formatting in accordance with the other references to it.
