Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _stConvergenceSLTypes and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _stConvergenceSLTypes,
changes the name of the struct to
bcm_convergence_types, and updates the
comments appropriately. In addition, any
calls to typedefs "stConvergenceSLTypes,
CConvergenceSLTypes, and *pstConvergenceSLTypes"
are changed to call the struct directly.
