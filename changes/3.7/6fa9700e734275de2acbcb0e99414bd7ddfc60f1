Btrfs: fix error path in create_pending_snapshot()

This patch fixes the following problem:
- If we failed to deal with the delayed dir items, we should abort transaction,
  just as its comment said. Fix it.
- If root reference or root back reference insertion failed, we should
  abort transaction. Fix it.
- Fix the double free problem of pending->inherit.
- Do not restore the trans->rsv if we doesn't change it.
- make the error path more clearly.
