sparc64: Fix build with mix of modular vs. non-modular crypto drivers.

We tried linking in a single built object to hold the device table,
but only works if all of the sparc64 crypto modules get built the same
way (modular vs. non-modular).

Just include the device ID stub into each driver source file so that
the table gets compiled into the correct result in all cases.
