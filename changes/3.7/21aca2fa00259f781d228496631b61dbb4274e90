TTY: pty, switch to tty_alloc_driver

Switch to the new driver allocation interface, as this is one of the
special call-sites. Here, we need TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_ALLOC to not
allocate tty_driver->ports, cdevs and potentially other structures
because we reserve too many lines in pty. Instead, it provides the
tty_port<->tty_struct link in tty->ops->install already.
