PM / Domains: Move syscore flag from subsys data to struct device

The syscore device PM flag is used to mark the devices (belonging to
a PM domain) that should never be turned off, except for the system
core (syscore) suspend/hibernation and resume stages.  That flag is
stored in the device's struct pm_subsys_data object whose address is
available from struct device.  However, in some situations it may be
convenient to set that flag before the device is added to a PM
domain, so it is better to move it directly to the "power" member of
struct device.  Then, it can be checked by the routines in
drivers/base/power/runtime.c and drivers/base/power/main.c, which is
more straightforward.

This also reduces the number of dev_gpd_data() invocations in the
generic PM domains framework, so the overhead related to the syscore
flag is slightly smaller.
