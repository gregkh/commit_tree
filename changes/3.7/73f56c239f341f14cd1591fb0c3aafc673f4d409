[media] ARM: samsung: Remove unused fields from FIMC and CSIS platform data

The MIPI-CSI2 bus data alignment is now being derived from the media
bus pixel code, the drivers don't use the corresponding structure
fields, so remove them. Also remove the s5p_csis_phy_enable callback
which is now used directly by s5p-csis driver.
