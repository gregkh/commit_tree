unexport sock_map_fd(), switch to sock_alloc_file()

Both modular callers of sock_map_fd() had been buggy; sctp one leaks
descriptor and file if copy_to_user() fails, 9p one shouldn't be
exposing file in the descriptor table at all.

Switch both to sock_alloc_file(), export it, unexport sock_map_fd() and
make it static.
