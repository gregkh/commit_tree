scatterlist: atomic sg_mapping_iter() no longer needs disabled IRQs

SG mapping iterator w/ SG_MITER_ATOMIC set required IRQ disabled because
it originally used KM_BIO_SRC_IRQ to allow use from IRQ handlers.
kmap_atomic() has long been updated to handle stacking atomic mapping
requests on per-cpu basis and only requires not sleeping while mapped.

Update sg_mapping_iter such that atomic iterators only require disabling
preemption instead of disabling IRQ.

While at it, convert wte weird @ARG@ notations to @ARG in the comment of
sg_miter_start().
