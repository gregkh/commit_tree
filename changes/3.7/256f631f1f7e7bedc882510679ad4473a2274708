xen/arm: Introduce xen_ulong_t for unsigned long

All the original Xen headers have xen_ulong_t as unsigned long type, however
when they have been imported in Linux, xen_ulong_t has been replaced with
unsigned long. That might work for x86 and ia64 but it does not for arm.
Bring back xen_ulong_t and let each architecture define xen_ulong_t as they
see fit.

Also explicitly size pointers (__DEFINE_GUEST_HANDLE) to 64 bit.


Changes in v3:

- remove the incorrect changes to multicall_entry;
- remove the change to apic_physbase.
