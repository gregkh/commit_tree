ARM: perf: prepare for moving CPU PMU code into separate file

The CPU PMU code is tightly coupled with generic ARM PMU handling code.
This makes it cumbersome when trying to add support for other ARM PMUs
(e.g. interconnect, L2 cache controller, bus) as the generic parts of
the code are not readily reusable.

This patch cleans up perf_event.c so that reusable code is exposed via
header files to other potential PMU drivers. The CPU code is
consistently named to identify it as such and also to prepare for moving
it into a separate file.
