PCI: Use dev->irq instead of dev->pin to enable non MSI/INTx interrupt

On some platforms, root port has neither MSI/MSI-X nor INTx interrupt
generated in RC mode. In this case, we have to use other interrupt, e.g.,
system shared interrupt, for port service IRQ to have AER, Hot-plug, etc.,
services work.
