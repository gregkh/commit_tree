acpi-cpufreq: Add compatibility for legacy AMD cpb sysfs knob

The powernow-k8 driver supported a sysfs knob called "cpb", which was
instantiated per CPU, but actually acted globally for the whole
system. To keep some compatibility with this feature, we re-introduce
this behavior here, but:
a) only enable it on AMD CPUs and
b) protect it with a Kconfig switch

I'd like to consider this feature obsolete. Lets keep it around for
some kernel versions and then phase it out.
