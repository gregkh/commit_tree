powerpc: Rework set_dabr so it can take a DABRX value as well

Rework set_dabr to take a DABRX value as well.

Both the pseries and PS3 hypervisors do some checks on the DABRX
values that are passed in the hcall.  This patch stops bogus values
from being passed to hypervisor.  Also, in the case where we are
clearing the breakpoint, where DABR and DABRX are zero, we modify the
DABRX value to make it valid so that the hcall won't fail.
