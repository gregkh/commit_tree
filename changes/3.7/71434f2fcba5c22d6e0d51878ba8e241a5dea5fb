uprobes: Fix the racy uprobe->flags manipulation

Multiple threads can manipulate uprobe->flags, this is obviously
unsafe. For example mmap can set UPROBE_COPY_INSN while register
tries to set UPROBE_RUN_HANDLER, the latter can also race with
can_skip_sstep() which clears UPROBE_SKIP_SSTEP.

Change this code to use bitops.
