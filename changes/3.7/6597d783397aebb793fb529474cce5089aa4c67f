mm/mmap.c: replace find_vma_prepare() with clearer find_vma_links()

People get confused by find_vma_prepare(), because it doesn't care about
what it returns in its output args, when its callers won't be interested.

Clarify by passing in end-of-range address too, and returning failure if
any existing vma overlaps the new range: instead of returning an ambiguous
vma which most callers then must check.  find_vma_links() is a clearer
name.

This does revert 2.6.27's dfe195fb79e88 ("mm: fix uninitialized variables
for find_vma_prepare callers"), but it looks like gcc 4.3.0 was one of
those releases too eager to shout about uninitialized variables: only
copy_vma() warns with 4.5.1 and 4.7.1, which a BUG on error silences.
