can: sja1000: fix/add miniPCIe/cPCI PC/104Plus PCI/104e PEAK-System boards

This patch adds the support for 4 new PCI boards based on the SJA1000 CAN
controller, from PEAK-System Technik:

. PCAN-miniPCIe (PCI-Express Mini slots, available as single or dual-channel)
. PCAN-cPCI (CompactPCI format, available as single or dual-channel)
. PCAN-PC/104-Plus (PC/104-Plus system, av. as 1, 2 or 4 channels)
. PCAN-PCI/104-Express (PCI/104-Express system, av. as 1 or 2 channels)

This patch also fixes a typo in existing "PEAK_MPCI_DEVICE_ID" identifier
(missing "e" for Express). Finally, it also changes the author as well as it
updates the module supported devices list.
