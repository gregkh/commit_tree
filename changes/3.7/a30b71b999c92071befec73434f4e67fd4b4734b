rbd: lay out header probe infrastructure

This defines a new function rbd_dev_probe() as a top-level
function for populating detailed information about an rbd device.

It first checks for the existence of a format 2 rbd image id object.
If it exists, the image is assumed to be a format 2 rbd image, and
another function rbd_dev_v2() is called to finish populating
header data for that image.  If it does not exist, it is assumed to
be an old (format 1) rbd image, and calls a similar function
rbd_dev_v1() to populate its header information.

A new field, rbd_dev->format, is defined to record which version
of the rbd image format the device represents.  For a valid mapped
rbd device it will have one of two values, 1 or 2.

So far, the format 2 images are not really supported; this is
laying out the infrastructure for fleshing out that support.
