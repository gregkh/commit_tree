s390/sclp: fix addressing mode clobber

The early mini sclp driver may be called in zArch mode either in
31 or 64 bit addressing mode.
If called in 31 bit addressing mode the new external interrupt psw
however would switch to 64 bit addressing mode. This would cause an
addressing exception within the interrupt handler, since the code
didn't expect the zArch/31 bit addressing mode combination.

Fix this by setting the new psw addressing mode bits so they fit
the current addressing mode.
