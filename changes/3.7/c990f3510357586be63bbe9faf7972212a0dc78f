serial: omap: define and use to_uart_omap_port()

current code only works because struct uart_port
is the first member on the uart_omap_port structure.

If, for whatever reason, someone puts another
member as the first of the structure, that cast
won't work anymore. In order to be safe, let's use
a container_of() which, for now, gets optimized into
a cast anyway.
