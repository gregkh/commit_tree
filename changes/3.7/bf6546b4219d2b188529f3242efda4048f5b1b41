drm/nouveau/fan: rewrite the fan tachometer driver to get more precision, faster

The previous driver waited for 250ms to accumulate data. This version times a
complete fan rotation and extrapolates to RPM.

The fan rotational speed should now be read in less than 250ms (worst case)
and usually in less 50ms.
