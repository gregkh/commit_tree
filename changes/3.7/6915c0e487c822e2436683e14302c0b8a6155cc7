tty: uartclk value from serial_core exposed to sysfs

Added file /sys/devices/.../tty/ttySX/uartclk to allow reading
uartclk value in struct uart_port in serial_core via sysfs.

tty_register_device() has been generalized and refactored in order
to add support for setting drvdata and attribute_group to the device.
