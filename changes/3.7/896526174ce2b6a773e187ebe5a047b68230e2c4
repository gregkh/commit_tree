NFS: Introduce "migration" mount option

Currently, the Linux client uses a unique nfs_client_id4.id string
when identifying itself to distinct NFS servers.

To support transparent state migration, the Linux client will have to
use the same nfs_client_id4 string for all servers it communicates
with (also known as the "uniform client string" approach).  Otherwise
NFS servers can not recognize that open and lock state need to be
merged after a file system transition.

Unfortunately, there are some NFSv4.0 servers currently in the field
that do not tolerate the uniform client string approach.

Thus, by default, our NFSv4.0 mounts will continue to use the current
approach, and we introduce a mount option that switches them to use
the uniform model.  Client administrators must identify which servers
can be mounted with this option.  Eventually most NFSv4.0 servers will
be able to handle the uniform approach, and we can change the default.

The first mount of a server controls the behavior for all subsequent
mounts for the lifetime of that set of mounts of that server.  After
the last mount of that server is gone, the client erases the data
structure that tracks the lease.  A subsequent lease may then honor
a different "migration" setting.

This patch adds only the infrastructure for parsing the new mount
option.  Support for uniform client strings is added in a subsequent
patch.
