powerpc/eeh: Remove EEH PE for normal PCI hotplug

Function eeh_rmv_from_parent_pe() could be called by the path of
either normal PCI hotplug, or EEH recovery. For the former case,
we need purge the corresponding PE on removal of the associated
PE bus.

The patch tries to cover that by passing more information to function
pcibios_remove_pci_devices() so that we know if the corresponding PE
needs to be purged or be marked as "invalid".
