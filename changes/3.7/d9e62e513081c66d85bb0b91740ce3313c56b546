[SCSI] qla4xxx: Clear interrupt while unloading driver.

while processing the stop firmware mailbox command on driver unload,
a interrupt is processed which causes kernel panic as the response
queue is not valid.

Fix is to clear the interrupt in free_adapter call just after
disabling the interrupts.
