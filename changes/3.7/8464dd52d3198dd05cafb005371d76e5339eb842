mmc: sh-mmcif: avoid oops on spurious interrupts

On some systems, e.g., kzm9g, MMCIF interfaces can produce spurious
interrupts without any active request. To prevent the Oops, that results
in such cases, don't dereference the mmc request pointer until we make
sure, that we are indeed processing such a request.
