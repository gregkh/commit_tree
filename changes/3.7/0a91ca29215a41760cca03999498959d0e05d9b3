drm/i915: check connector hw/sw state

Atm we can only check the connector state after a dpms call - while
doing modeset with the copy&pasted crtc helper code things are too
ill-defined for proper checking. But the idea is very much to call
this check from the modeset code, too.

v2: Fix dpms check and don't presume that if the hw isn't on that it
must not be linked up with an encoder (it could simply be switched off
with the dpms state).
