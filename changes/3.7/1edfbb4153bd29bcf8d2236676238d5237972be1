x86/64: Adjust types of temporaries used by ffs()/fls()/fls64()

The 64-bit special cases of the former two (the thrird one is
64-bit only anyway) don't need to use "long" temporaries, as the
result will always fit in a 32-bit variable, and the functions
return plain "int". This avoids a few REX prefixes, i.e.
minimally reduces code size.
