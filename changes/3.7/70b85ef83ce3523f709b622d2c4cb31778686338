remoteproc: add actual recovery implementation

Add rproc_trigger_recovery() which takes care of the recovery itself,
by removing, and re-adding, all of the remoteproc's virtio devices.

This resets all virtio users of the remote processor, during which
the remote processor is powered off and on again.
