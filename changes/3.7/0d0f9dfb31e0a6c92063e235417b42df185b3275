target: Don't return success from module_init() if setup fails

If the call to core_dev_release_virtual_lun0() fails, then nothing
sets ret to anything other than 0, so even though everything is
torn down and freed, target_core_init_configfs() will seem to succeed
and the module will be loaded.  Fix this by passing the return value
on up the chain.
