s390/mm: fix pmd_huge() usage for kernel mapping

pmd_huge() will always return 0 on !HUGETLBFS, however we use that helper
function when walking the kernel page tables to decide if we have a
1MB page frame or not.
Since we create 1MB frames for the kernel 1:1 mapping independently of
HUGETLBFS this can lead to incorrect storage accesses since the code
can assume that we have a pointer to a page table instead of a pointer
to a 1MB frame.

Fix this by adding a pmd_large() primitive like other architectures have
it already and remove all references to HUGETLBFS/HUGETLBPAGE from the
code that walks kernel page tables.
