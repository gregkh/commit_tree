target: Simplify fabric sense data length handling

Every fabric driver has to supply a se_tfo->set_fabric_sense_len()
method, just so iSCSI can return an offset of 2.  However, every fabric
driver is already allocating a sense buffer and passing it into the
target core, either via transport_init_se_cmd() or target_submit_cmd().

So instead of having iSCSI pass the start of its sense buffer into the
core and then later tell the core to skip the first 2 bytes, it seems
easier for iSCSI just to do the offset of 2 when it passes the sense
buffer into the core.  Then we can drop the se_tfo->set_fabric_sense_len()
everywhere, and just add a couple of lines of code to iSCSI to set the
sense data length to the beginning of the buffer right before it sends
it over the network.

(nab: Remove .set_fabric_sense_len usage from tcm_qla2xxx_npiv_ops +
      change transport_get_sense_buffer to follow v3.6-rc6 code w/o
      ->set_fabric_sense_len usage)
