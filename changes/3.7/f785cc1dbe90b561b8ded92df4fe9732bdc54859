rbd: kill incore snap_names_len

The only thing the on-disk snap_names_len field is needed is to
size the buffer allocated to hold a copy of the snapshot names
for an rbd image.

So don't bother saving it in the in-core rbd_image_header structure.
Just use a local variable to hold the required buffer size while
it's needed.

Move the code that actually copies the snapshot names up closer
to where the required length is saved.
