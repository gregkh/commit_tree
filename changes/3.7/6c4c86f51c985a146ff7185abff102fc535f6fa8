    drm/i915: implement new set_mode code flow

I've noticed this because some Xorg versions seem to set up a new mode
with every crtc at (0,0) and then pan to the right multi-monitor
setup. And since some hacks of mine added more calls to mode_set using
the stored crtc->x/y my multi-screen setup blew up.
