mtd: check for max_bitflips in mtd_read_oob()

mtd_read_oob() has some unexpected similarities to mtd_read(). For
instance, when ops->datbuf != NULL, nand_base.c might return max_bitflips;
however, when ops->datbuf == NULL, nand_base's code potentially could
return -EUCLEAN (no in-tree drivers do this yet). In any case where the
driver might return max_bitflips, we should translate this into an
appropriate return code using the bitflip_threshold.

Essentially, mtd_read_oob() duplicates the logic from mtd_read().

This prevents users of mtd_read_oob() from receiving a positive return
value (i.e., from max_bitflips) and interpreting it as an unknown error.

Artem: amend comments.
