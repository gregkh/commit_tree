MODSIGN: Don't use enum-type bitfields in module signature info block

Don't use enum-type bitfields in the module signature info block as we can't be
certain how the compiler will handle them.  As I understand it, it is arch
dependent, and it is possible for the compiler to rearrange them based on
endianness and to insert a byte of padding to pad the three enums out to four
bytes.

Instead use u8 fields for these, which the compiler should emit in the right
order without padding.
