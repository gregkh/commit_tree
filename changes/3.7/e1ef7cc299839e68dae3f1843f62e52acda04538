drm/i915: Macro to determine DPF support

Originally I had a macro specifically for DPF support, and Daniel, with
good reason asked me to change it to this. It's not the way I would have
gone (and indeed I didn't), but for now there is no distinction as all
platforms with L3 also have DPF.

Note: The good reasons are that dpf is a l3$ feature (at least on
currrent hw), hence I don't expect one to go without the other.
