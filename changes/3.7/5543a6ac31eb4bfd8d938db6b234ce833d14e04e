virtio: don't crash when device is buggy

Because of a sanity check in virtio_dev_remove, a buggy device can crash
kernel.  And in case of rproc it's userspace so it's not a good idea.
We are unloading a driver so how bad can it be?
Be less aggressive in handling this error: if it's a driver bug,
warning once should be enough.
