ALSA: Define more channel map positions

For following the standard, define more channel map positions and
shuffle the items a bit:

- As both PulseAudio and gstreamer define MONO channel position
  explicitly, we should follow that, too.  The mono streams point to
  this channel position unless they are explicitly assigned to certain
  channel positions.

- Top-front-* and Top-rear-* positions are added, carried from
  PulseAudio's definitions.

- Move NA and MONO definitions at the top of table right after
  UNKNOWN, since these are more abstract in comparison with other
  practical positions.
