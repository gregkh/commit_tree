Make most arch asm/module.h files use asm-generic/module.h

Use the mapping of Elf_[SPE]hdr, Elf_Addr, Elf_Sym, Elf_Dyn, Elf_Rel/Rela,
ELF_R_TYPE() and ELF_R_SYM() to either the 32-bit version or the 64-bit version
into asm-generic/module.h for all arches bar MIPS.

Also, use the generic definition mod_arch_specific where possible.

To this end, I've defined three new config bools:

 (*) HAVE_MOD_ARCH_SPECIFIC

     Arches define this if they don't want to use the empty generic
     mod_arch_specific struct.

 (*) MODULES_USE_ELF_RELA

     Arches define this if their modules can contain RELA records.  This causes
     the Elf_Rela mapping to be emitted and allows apply_relocate_add() to be
     defined by the arch rather than have the core emit an error message.

 (*) MODULES_USE_ELF_REL

     Arches define this if their modules can contain REL records.  This causes
     the Elf_Rel mapping to be emitted and allows apply_relocate() to be
     defined by the arch rather than have the core emit an error message.

Note that it is possible to allow both REL and RELA records: m68k and mips are
two arches that do this.

With this, some arch asm/module.h files can be deleted entirely and replaced
with a generic-y marker in the arch Kbuild file.

Additionally, I have removed the bits from m32r and score that handle the
unsupported type of relocation record as that's now handled centrally.
