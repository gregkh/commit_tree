n_gsm: uplink SKBs accumulate on list

gsm_dlci_data_kick will not call any output function if tx_bytes > THRESH_LO
furthermore it will call the output function only once if tx_bytes == 0
If the size of the IP writes are on the order of THRESH_LO
we can get into a situation where skbs accumulate on the outbound list
being starved for events to call the output function.

gsm_dlci_data_kick now calls the sweep function when tx_bytes==0
