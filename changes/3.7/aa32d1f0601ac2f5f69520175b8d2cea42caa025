mtd: sh_flctl: Use different OOB layout

The flctl hardware has changed and a new OOB layout must be adapted for
2KiB page size NAND chips when using hardware ECC.
The related bit fields ECCPOS[0-2] are gone â€” the bits are marked as
reserved now in the datasheet. As there are no official users of the
hardware ECC so far, they are completely removed.
