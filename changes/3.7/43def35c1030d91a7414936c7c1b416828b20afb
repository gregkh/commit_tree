net/9p: Check errno validity

While working on a modified server I had the Linux clients crash
a few times. This lead me to find this:

Some error codes are directly extracted from the server replies.
A malformed server reply could contain an invalid error code, with a
very large value. If this value is then passed to ERR_PTR() it will
not be properly detected as an error code by IS_ERR() and as a result
the kernel will dereference an invalid pointer.

This patch tries to avoid this.
