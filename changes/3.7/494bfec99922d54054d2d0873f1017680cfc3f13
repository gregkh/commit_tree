clk: add of_clk_src_onecell_get() support

For those SoCs that have hundreds of clock outputs, their clock
DT bindings could reasonably define #clock-cells as 1 and require
the client device specify the index of the clock it consumes in the
cell of its "clocks" phandle.

Add a generic of_clk_src_onecell_get() function for this purpose.
