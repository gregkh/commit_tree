rbd: do some header initialization earlier

Move some of the code that initializes an rbd header out of
rbd_init_disk() and into its caller.

Move the code at the end of rbd_init_disk() that sets the device
capacity and activates the Linux device out of that function and
into the caller, ensuring we still have the disk size available
where we need it.

Update rbd_free_disk() so it still aligns well as an inverse of
rbd_init_disk(), moving the rbd_header_free() call out to its
caller.
