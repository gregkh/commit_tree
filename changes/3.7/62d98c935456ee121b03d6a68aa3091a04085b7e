NFS4: avoid underflow when converting error to pointer.

In nfs4_create_sec_client, 'flavor' can hold a negative error
code (returned from nfs4_negotiate_security), even though it
is an 'enum' and hence unsigned.

The code is careful to cast it to an (int) before testing if it
is negative, however it doesn't cast to an (int) before calling
ERR_PTR.

On a machine where "void*" is larger than "int", this results in
the unsigned equivalent of -1 (e.g. 0xffffffff) being converted
to a pointer.  Subsequent code determines that this is not
negative, and so  dereferences it with predictable results.

So: cast 'flavor' to a (signed) int before passing to ERR_PTR.
