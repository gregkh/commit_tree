firewire: addendum to address handler RCU conversion

Follow up on commit c285f6ff6787 "firewire: remove global lock around
address handlers, convert to RCU":

  - address_handler_lock no longer serializes the address handler, only
    its function to serialize updates to the list of handlers remains.
    Rename the lock to address_handler_list_lock.

  - Callers of fw_core_remove_address_handler() must be able to sleep.
    Comment on this in the API documentation.

  - The counterpart fw_core_add_address_handler() is by nature something
    which is used in process context.  Replace spin_lock_bh() by
    spin_lock() in fw_core_add_address_handler() and in
    fw_core_remove_address_handler(), and document that process context
    is now required for fw_core_add_address_handler().

  - Extend the documentation of fw_address_callback_t.
