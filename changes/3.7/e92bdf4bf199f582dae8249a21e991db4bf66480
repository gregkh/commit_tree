of/mdio-gpio: Simplify the way device tree support is implemented.

This patch cleans up the way device tree support is added in mdio-gpio
driver. I found lot of code duplication which is not necessary.
Also strangely a new platform driver was also introduced for device tree
support. All this forced me to do this cleanup patch.
After this patch, the driver probe checks the of_node pointer to get the
data from device tree.
