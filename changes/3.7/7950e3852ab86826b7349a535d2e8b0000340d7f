vfs: embed struct filename inside of names_cache allocation if possible

In the common case where a name is much smaller than PATH_MAX, an extra
allocation for struct filename is unnecessary. Before allocating a
separate one, try to embed the struct filename inside the buffer first. If
it turns out that that's not long enough, then fall back to allocating a
separate struct filename and redoing the copy.
