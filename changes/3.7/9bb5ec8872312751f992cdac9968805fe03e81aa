sh: CMT: Introduce clocksource/clock events suspend/resume routines

Introduce suspend/resume routines for SH CMT clock event devices and
modify the suspend/resume routines for SH CMT clock sources such that
if those devices belong to a PM domain, the generic PM domains
framework will be notified that the given domain may be turned off
(during system suspend) or that it has to be turned on (during system
resume).
