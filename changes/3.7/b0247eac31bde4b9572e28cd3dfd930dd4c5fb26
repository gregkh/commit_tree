ARM: nomadik: remove NAND_NO_READRDY use

The nhk8815 board files uses NAND_NO_READRDY in its platform data, but
this macro is getting removed because it was not being used anywhere.

Without this patch, building nhk8815_defconfig results in:

arch/arm/mach-nomadik/board-nhk8815.c:118:6: error: 'NAND_NO_READRDY' undeclared here (not in a function)
