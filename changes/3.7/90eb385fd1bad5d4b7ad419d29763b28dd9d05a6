ARM: msm: io: Change the default static iomappings to be shared

With 3.4 kernel the static iomappings can be shared with the ioremap
mappings. If ioremap is called with an address for which a static
mapping already exists, then that mapping should be used instead
of creating a new one.

However, the MT_DEVICE_NONSHARED flag prevents this. Hence, get rid
of this flag. Some targets (7X00) that require the static iomappings
to be NONSHARED use the MSM_DEVICE_TYPE and MSM_CHIP_DEVICE_TYPE macros.
