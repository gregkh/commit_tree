block: Add bio_reset()

Reusing bios is something that's been highly frowned upon in the past,
but driver code keeps doing it anyways. If it's going to happen anyways,
we should provide a generic method.

This'll help with getting rid of bi_destructor - drivers/block/pktcdvd.c
was open coding it, by doing a bio_init() and resetting bi_destructor.

This required reordering struct bio, but the block layer is not yet
nearly fast enough for any cacheline effects to matter here.

v5: Add a define BIO_RESET_BITS, to be very explicit about what parts of
bio->bi_flags are saved.
v6: Further commenting verbosity, per Tejun
v9: Add a function comment
