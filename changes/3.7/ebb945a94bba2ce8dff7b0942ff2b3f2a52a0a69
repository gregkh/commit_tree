drm/nouveau: port all engines to new engine module format

This is a HUGE commit, but it's not nearly as bad as it looks - any problems
can be isolated to a particular chipset and engine combination.  It was
simply too difficult to port each one at a time, the compat layers are
*already* ridiculous.

Most of the changes here are simply to the glue, the process for each of the
engine modules was to start with a standard skeleton and copy+paste the old
code into the appropriate places, fixing up variable names etc as needed.

v2: Marcin Slusarz <marcin.slusarz@gmail.com>
- fix find/replace bug in license header

v3: Ben Skeggs <bskeggs@redhat.com>
- bump indirect pushbuf size to 8KiB, 4KiB barely enough for userspace and
  left no space for kernel's requirements during GEM pushbuf submission.
- fix duplicate assignments noticed by clang

v4: Marcin Slusarz <marcin.slusarz@gmail.com>
- add sparse annotations to nv04_fifo_pause/nv04_fifo_start
- use ioread32_native/iowrite32_native for fifo control registers

v5: Ben Skeggs <bskeggs@redhat.com>
- rebase on v3.6-rc4, modified to keep copy engine fix intact
- nv10/fence: unmap fence bo before destroying
