powerpc/perf: Sample only if SIAR-Valid bit is set in P7+

powerpc/perf: Sample only if SIAR-Valid bit is set in P7+

On POWER7+ two new bits (mmcra[35] and mmcra[36]) indicate whether the
contents of SIAR and SDAR are valid.

For marked instructions on P7+, we must save the contents of SIAR and
SDAR registers only if these new bits are set.

This code/check for the SIAR-Valid bit is specific to P7+, so rather than
waste a CPU-feature bit use the PVR flag.

Note that Carl Love proposed a similar change for oprofile:
