Input: Improve the events-per-packet estimate

The events-per-packet estimate has so far been used by MT devices
only. This patch adjusts the packet buffer size to also accomodate the
KEY and MSC events.  Keyboards normally send one or two keys at a
time. MT devices normally send a number of button keys along with the
MT information.  The buffer size chosen here covers those cases, and
matches the default buffer size in evdev. Since the input estimate is
now preferred, remove the special input-mt estimate.
