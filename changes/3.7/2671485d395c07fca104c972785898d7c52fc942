Btrfs: remove unused hint byte argument for btrfs_drop_extents

I audited all users of btrfs_drop_extents and found that nobody actually uses
the hint_byte argument.  I'm sure it was used for something at some point but
it's not used now, and the way the pinning works the disk bytenr would never be
immediately useful anyway so lets just remove it.  Thanks,
