ext4: don't call update_backups() multiple times for the same bg

When performing an online resize, we add a bunch of groups at one time
in ext4_flex_group_add, so in most cases a lot of group descriptors
will be in the same group block. But in the end of this function,
update_backups will be called for every group descriptor and the same
block will be copied and journalled again and again.  It is really a
waste.

Fix things so we only update a particular bg descriptor block once and
skip subsequent updates of the same block.
