[SCSI] libsas, ipr: cleanup ata_host flags initialization via ata_host_init

libsas and ipr pass flags to ata_host_init that are meant for the port.

ata_host flags:
	ATA_HOST_SIMPLEX	= (1 << 0),	/* Host is simplex, one DMA channel per host only */
	ATA_HOST_STARTED	= (1 << 1),	/* Host started */
	ATA_HOST_PARALLEL_SCAN	= (1 << 2),	/* Ports on this host can be scanned in parallel */
	ATA_HOST_IGNORE_ATA	= (1 << 3),	/* Ignore ATA devices on this host. */

flags passed by libsas:
	ATA_FLAG_SATA		= (1 << 1),
	ATA_FLAG_PIO_DMA	= (1 << 7), /* PIO cmds via DMA */
	ATA_FLAG_NCQ		= (1 << 10), /* host supports NCQ */

The only one that aliases is ATA_HOST_STARTED which is a 'don't care' in
the libsas and ipr cases since ata_hosts from these sources are not
registered with libata.
