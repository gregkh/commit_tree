arm64: fix alignment padding in assembly code

An interesting effect of using the generic version of linkage.h
is that the padding is defined in terms of x86 NOPs, which can have
even more interesting effects when the assembly code looks like this:

ENTRY(func1)
	mov	x0, xzr
ENDPROC(func1)
	// fall through
ENTRY(func2)
	mov	x0, #1
	ret
ENDPROC(func2)

Admittedly, the code is not very nice. But having code from another
architecture doesn't look completely sane either.

The fix is to add arm64's version of linkage.h, which causes the insertion
of proper AArch64 NOPs.
