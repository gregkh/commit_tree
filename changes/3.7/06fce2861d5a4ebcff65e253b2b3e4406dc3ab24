[media] DocBook: Mark CROPCAP as optional instead of as compulsory

While the documentation says that VIDIOC_CROPCAP is compulsory for
all video capture and output devices, in practice VIDIOC_CROPCAP is
only implemented for devices that can do cropping and/or scaling.
Update the documentation to no longer require VIDIOC_CROPCAP if the
driver does not support cropping or scaling or non-square pixels.
