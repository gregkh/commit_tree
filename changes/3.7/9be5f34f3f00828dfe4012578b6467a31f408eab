s390/mm: let kernel text section always begin at 1MB

Let the kernel text section always begin at 1MB. This allows to always have
a large frame in the identity mapping of the kernel image for beginning of
the text section, if the machine has EDAT1 support.
Moving the beginning from 64K to 1MB doesn't cost any memory, since we make
the memory between 64K and 1MB available for the page allocator.
