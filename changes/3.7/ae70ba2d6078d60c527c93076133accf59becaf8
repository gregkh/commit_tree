mtd: gpmi: do not get the clock frequency in gpmi_begin()

The current code will gets the clock frequency which is used by
gpmi_nfc_compute_hardware_timing(). It makes the code a little mess.

So move the `get clock frequency` code to the
gpmi_nfc_compute_hardware_timing() itself. This makes the code tidy
and clean.

This patch also uses the macro NSEC_PER_SEC to replace the `1000000000`.
