usb/acpi: Bind ACPI node to USB port, not usb_device.

In the ACPI DSDT table, only usb root hub and usb ports are ACPI device
nodes.  Originally, we bound the usb port's ACPI node to the usb device
attached to the port.  However, we want to access those ACPI port
methods when the port is empty, and there's no usb_device associated
with that port.

Now that the usb port is a real device, we can bind the port's ACPI node
to struct usb_port instead.
