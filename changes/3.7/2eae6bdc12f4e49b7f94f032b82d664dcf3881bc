Staging: add ced1401 USB driver

This was imported from the
http://pub.ist.ac.at/~schloegl/src/ced1401/.git git repo at the request
of Alois.  The driver originally came from Cambridge Electronic Design
Ltd and was authored by Greg P Smith and others, but Alois did the
maintance work to get it into a semi-building state and pushed to get it
into the main kernel tree here.
