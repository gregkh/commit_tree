video: exynos_dp: adjust voltage swing and pre-emphasis during Link Training

This patch adds adjustement for voltage swing and pre-emphasis during
Link Training procedure. According to the DP specification, unless all
the LANEx_CR_DONE bits are set, the transmitter must read
the ADJUST_REQUEST_LANEx_x, increase the voltage swing according to
the request, and update the TRAINING_LANEx_SET bytes to match the new
voltage swing setting.

Refer to the DP specification v1.1a, Section 3.5.1.3 Link Training.
