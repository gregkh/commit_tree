xen/xen_initial_domain: check that xen_start_info is initialized

Since commit commit 4c071ee5268f7234c3d084b6093bebccc28cdcba ("arm:
initial Xen support") PV on HVM guests can be xen_initial_domain.
However PV on HVM guests might have an unitialized xen_start_info, so
check before accessing its fields.
