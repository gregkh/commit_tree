ixgbevf: Add support for VF API negotiation

This change makes it so that the VF can support the PF/VF API negotiation
protocol.  Specifically in this case we are adding support for API 1.0
which will mean that the VF is capable of cleaning up buffers that span
multiple descriptors without triggering an error.
