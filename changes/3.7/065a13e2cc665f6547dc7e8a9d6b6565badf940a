Bluetooth: SMP: Fix setting unknown auth_req bits

When sending a pairing request or response we should not just blindly
copy the value that the remote device sent. Instead we should at least
make sure to mask out any unknown bits. This is particularly critical
from the upcoming LE Secure Connections feature perspective as
incorrectly indicating support for it (by copying the remote value)
would cause a failure to pair with devices that support it.
