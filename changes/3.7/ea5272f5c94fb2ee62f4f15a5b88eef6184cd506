rbtree: fix incorrect rbtree node insertion in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c

The recently added code to use rbtrees in sysctl did not follow the proper
rbtree interface on insertion - it was calling rb_link_node() which
inserts a new node into the binary tree, but missed the call to
rb_insert_color() which properly balances the rbtree and establishes all
expected rbtree invariants.

I found out about this only because faulty commit also used
rb_init_node(), which I am removing within this patchset.  But I think
it's an easy mistake to make, and it makes me wonder if we should change
the rbtree API so that insertions would be done with a single rb_insert()
call (even if its implementation could still inline the rb_link_node()
part and call a private __rb_insert_color function to do the rebalancing).
