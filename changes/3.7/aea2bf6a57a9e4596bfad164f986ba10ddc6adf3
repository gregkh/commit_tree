Input: wacom - handle split-sensor devices with internal hubs

Like our other pen-and-touch products, the Cintiq 24HD touch needs data
to be shared between its two sensors to facilitate proximity-based palm
rejection.

Unlike other tablets that report sensor data through separate interfaces
of the same USB device, the Cintiq 24HD touch has separate USB devices
that are connected to an internal USB hub.

This patch makes it possible to designate the USB VID/PID of the other
device so that the two may share data.  To ensure we don't accidentally
link to a sensor from a physically separate device (if several have been
plugged in), we limit the search to siblings (i.e., devices directly
connected to the same hub).
