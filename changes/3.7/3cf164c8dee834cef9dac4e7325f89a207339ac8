mlx4_core: Remove annoying debug messages from SR-IOV flow

These debug prints left behind by commits c82e9aa0a8bc ("mlx4_core:
resource tracking for HCA resources used by guests"), 54679e148287
("mlx4: Implement QP paravirtualization and maintain phys_pkey_cache
for smp_snoop") and 993c401e2079 ("mlx4_core: Add IB port-state
machine and port mgmt event propagation") make it pretty hard to
actually use the mlx4_core debug messages when running in SRIOV/IB
mode -- for example, the module load sequence of a device with one VF
yielded 631 debug prints, with 408 of them being from this set.  Let's
just remove them.
