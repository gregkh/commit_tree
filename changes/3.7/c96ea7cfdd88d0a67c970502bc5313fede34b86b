rcu: Avoid spurious RCU CPU stall warnings

If a given CPU avoids the idle loop but also avoids starting a new
RCU grace period for a full minute, RCU can issue spurious RCU CPU
stall warnings.  This commit fixes this issue by adding a check for
ongoing grace period to avoid these spurious stall warnings.
