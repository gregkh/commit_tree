spi/mpc512x-psc: Avoid access to freed memory in device remove function

The call to spi_unregister_master() in the device remove function frees device
memory, and with it any device local data. However, device local data is still
accessed after the call to spi_unregister_master().

Acquire a reference to the SPI master device and release it after cleanup is
complete to solve the problem.
