s390/mm: rename addressing_mode to s390_user_mode

Renaming the globally visible variable "user_mode" to "addressing_mode" in
order to fix a name clash was not a good idea. (Commit 37fe1d73 "s390/mm:
rename user_mode variable to addressing_mode")
Looking at the code after a couple of weeks one thinks: addressing mode of
what?
So rename the variable again. This time to s390_user_mode. Which hopefully
makes more sense.
