Staging: ipack/bridges/tpci200: RCU protect slot_irq pointers.

In tpci200_request_irq as well as tpci200_free_irq we set and unset the
pointer to struct slot_irq.  This pointer is accessed in
tpci200_interrupt.  To ensure that the pointer is not freed after it has
been fetched in tpci200_interrupt() it is now protected through RCU.
