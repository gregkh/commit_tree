ima: add support for different security.ima data types

IMA-appraisal currently verifies the integrity of a file based on a
known 'good' measurement value.  This patch reserves the first byte
of 'security.ima' as a place holder for the type of method used for
verifying file data integrity.

Changelog v1:
- Use the newly defined 'struct evm_ima_xattr_data'
