thp: remove some code depend on CONFIG_NUMA

If NUMA is disabled, hpage is used as page pre-alloc, so there are two
cases for hpage:

- it is !NULL, means the page is not consumed otherwise,
- the page has been consumed

If NUMA is enabled, hpage is just used as alloc-fail indicator which is
not a real page, NULL means not fail triggered.

So, we can release the page only if !IS_ERR_OR_NULL
