openrisc: delay: fix loops calculation for __const_udelay

The openrisc implementation of __const_udelay casts the result of a
32-bit multiplication to 64 bits and passes the top 32 bits to __delay.
Since there are no casts on the arguments, this results in a __delay of
zero, regardless of the xloops parameter.

This patch fixes the problem by casting xloops to (unsigned long long),
ensuring that the multiplication is not truncated.
