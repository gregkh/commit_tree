ALSA: hda - Avoid BDL position workaround when no_period_wakeup is set

Originally the bogus period at BDL head was introduced as a workaround
for the mismatching position update at the period boundary, typically
seen on dmix.  However, for applications like PulseAudio that don't
require period wake ups, this workaround is just superfluous.  Thus
better to disable it when no_period_wakeup is given in hw_params.
