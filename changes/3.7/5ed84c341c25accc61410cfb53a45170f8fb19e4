HID: picoLCD: bounds check in dump_buff_as_hex()

Make sure we keep enough space for terminating NUL character after last
newline. If we have too much data, replace last byte with '.'s to
make overflow visible.

Using hex_dump_to_buffer() is not interesting as it adds more overhead
and does not append the trailing linefeed.
