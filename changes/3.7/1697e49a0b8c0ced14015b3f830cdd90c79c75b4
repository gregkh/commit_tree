[media] omap3isp: video: Split format info bpp field into width and bpp

The bpp field currently stores the sample width and is aligned to the
next multiple of 8 bits when computing data size in memory. This won't
work anymore for YUYV8_2X8 formats. Split the bpp field into a sample
width and a bytes per pixel value.
