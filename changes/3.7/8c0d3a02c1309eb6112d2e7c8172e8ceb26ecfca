PCI: Add accessors for PCI Express Capability

The PCI Express Capability (PCIe spec r3.0, sec 7.8) comes in two
versions, v1 and v2.  In v1 Capability structures (PCIe spec r1.0 and
r1.1), some fields are optional, so the structure size depends on the
device type.

This patch adds functions to access this capability so drivers don't
have to be aware of the differences between v1 and v2.  Note that these
new functions apply only to the "PCI Express Capability," not to any of
the other "PCI Express Extended Capabilities" (AER, VC, ACS, MFVC, etc.)

Function pcie_capability_read_word/dword() reads the PCIe Capabilities
register and returns the value in the reference parameter "val".  If
the PCIe Capabilities register is not implemented on the PCIe device,
"val" is set to 0.

Function pcie_capability_write_word/dword() writes the value to the
specified PCIe Capability register.

Function pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word/dword() sets and/or clears bits
of a PCIe Capability register.
