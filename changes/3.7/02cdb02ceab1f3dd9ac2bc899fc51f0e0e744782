rbd: kill create_snap sysfs entry

Josh proposed the following change, and I don't think I could
explain it any better than he did:

    From: Josh Durgin <josh.durgin@inktank.com>
    Date: Tue, 24 Jul 2012 14:22:11 -0700
    To: ceph-devel <ceph-devel@vger.kernel.org>
    Message-ID: <500F1203.9050605@inktank.com>

    Right now the kernel still has one piece of rbd management
    duplicated from the rbd command line tool: snapshot creation.
    There's nothing special about snapshot creation that makes it
    advantageous to do from the kernel, so I'd like to remove the
    create_snap sysfs interface.  That is,
	/sys/bus/rbd/devices/<id>/create_snap
    would be removed.

    Does anyone rely on the sysfs interface for creating rbd
    snapshots?  If so, how hard would it be to replace with:

	rbd snap create pool/image@snap

    Is there any benefit to the sysfs interface that I'm missing?

    Josh

This patch implements this proposal, removing the code that
implements the "snap_create" sysfs interface for rbd images.
As a result, quite a lot of other supporting code goes away.
