arm64: CPU support

This patch adds AArch64 CPU specific functionality. It assumes that the
implementation is generic to AArch64 and does not require specific
identification. Different CPU implementations may require the setting of
various ACTLR_EL1 bits but such information is not currently available
and it should ideally be pushed to firmware.
