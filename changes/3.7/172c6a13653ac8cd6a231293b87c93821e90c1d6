gpio: samsung: add devicetree init for s3c24xx arches

Until now the EXYNOS-SoC was the only Samsung-SoC supporting the GPIOs
via the device tree. This patch implements dt-support for the
s3c24xx arches.

The controllers contain only 3 cells, as the underlying gpio controller
does not support controlling the drive strength on a gpio level.

Tested with the gpio-keys driver on a s3c2416 based machine.
