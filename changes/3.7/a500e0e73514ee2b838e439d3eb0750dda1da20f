Drivers: hv: kvp: Copy the address family information

This is part of the IP injection protocol in that the host expects this field
to reflect what addresses (address families) are currently bound to the
interface. The KVP daemon is currently collecting this information and sending
it to the kernel component. I had overlooked copying this and sending it
back to the host. This patch addresses this issue.
