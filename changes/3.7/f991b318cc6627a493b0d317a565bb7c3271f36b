workqueue: clean up delayed_work initializers and add missing one

Reimplement delayed_work initializers using new timer initializers
which take timer flags.  This reduces code duplications and will ease
further initializer changes.  This patch also adds a missing
initializer - INIT_DEFERRABLE_WORK_ONSTACK().
