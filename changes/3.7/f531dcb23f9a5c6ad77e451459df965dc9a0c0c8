    drm/i915: properly guard ilk ips state

The core functions were annotated with their locking requirements, but
we overlooked that they were exported, without any control over the
locking, to debugfs. So in order to enable debugfs to read the registers
without triggering sanity checks, we change the exported entry points to
properly take the required locks before calling the core routines.
