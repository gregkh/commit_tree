drm/i915: Lazily apply the SNB+ seqno w/a

Avoid the forcewake overhead when simply retiring requests, as often the
last seen seqno is good enough to satisfy the retirment process and will
be promptly re-run in any case. Only ensure that we force the coherent
seqno read when we are explicitly waiting upon a completion event to be
sure that none go missing, and also for when we are reporting seqno
values in case of error or debugging.

This greatly reduces the load for userspace using the busy-ioctl to
track active buffers, for instance halving the CPU used by X in pushing
the pixels from a software render (flash). The effect will be even more
magnified with userptr and so providing a zero-copy upload path in that
instance, or in similar instances where X is simply compositing DRI
buffers.

v2: Reverse the polarity of the tachyon stream. Daniel suggested that
'force' was too generic for the parameter name and that 'lazy_coherency'
better encapsulated the semantics of it being an optimization and its
purpose. Also notice that gen6_get_seqno() is only used by gen6/7
chipsets and so the test for IS_GEN6 || IS_GEN7 is redundant in that
function.
