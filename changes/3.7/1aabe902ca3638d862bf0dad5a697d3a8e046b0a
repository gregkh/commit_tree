workqueue: introduce system_highpri_wq

Commit 3270476a6c0ce322354df8679652f060d66526dc ('workqueue: reimplement
WQ_HIGHPRI using a separate worker_pool') introduce separate worker pool
for HIGHPRI. When we handle busyworkers for gcwq, it can be normal worker
or highpri worker. But, we don't consider this difference in rebind_workers(),
we use just system_wq for highpri worker. It makes mismatch between
cwq->pool and worker->pool.

It doesn't make error in current implementation, but possible in the future.
Now, we introduce system_highpri_wq to use proper cwq for highpri workers
in rebind_workers(). Following patch fix this issue properly.

tj: Even apart from rebinding, having system_highpri_wq generally
    makes sense.
