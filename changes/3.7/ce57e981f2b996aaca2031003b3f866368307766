firmware: use 'kernel_read()' to read firmware into kernel buffer

Fengguang correctly points out that the firmware reading should not use
vfs_read(), since the buffer is in kernel space.

The vfs_read() just happened to work for kernel threads, but sparse
warns about the incorrect address spaces, and it's definitely incorrect
and could fail for other users of the firmware loading.
