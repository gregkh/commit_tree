ALSA: hda - Call snd_hda_jack_report_sync() generically in hda_codec.c

Instead of calling the jack sync in the init callback of each codec,
call it generically at initialization and resume.  By calling it at
the last of resume sequence, a possible race between the jack sync and
the unsol event enablement in the current code will be closed, too.
