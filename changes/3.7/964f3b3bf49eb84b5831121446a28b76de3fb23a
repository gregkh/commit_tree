KEYS: Implement asymmetric key type

Create a key type that can be used to represent an asymmetric key type for use
in appropriate cryptographic operations, such as encryption, decryption,
signature generation and signature verification.

The key type is "asymmetric" and can provide access to a variety of
cryptographic algorithms.

Possibly, this would be better as "public_key" - but that has the disadvantage
that "public key" is an overloaded term.
