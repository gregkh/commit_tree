cpufreq: OMAP: fix clock usage to be SoC independent, remove plat/ includes

OMAP core code now has SoC-independent clock alias for the scalable
CPU clock.  Using it means driver is SoC independent and will work for
AM3xxx SoCs as well as OMAP1/3/4.

While here, remove some unnecessary plat/ includes that are
interfering with multi-subarch ARM kernels.
