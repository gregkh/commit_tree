mm: remain migratetype in freed page

The page allocator caches the pageblock information in page->private while
it is in the PCP freelists but this is overwritten with the order of the
page when freed to the buddy allocator.  This patch stores the migratetype
of the page in the page->index field so that it is available at all times
when the page remain in free_list.

This patch adds a new call site in __free_pages_ok so it might be overhead
a bit but it's for high order allocation.  So I believe damage isn't hurt.
