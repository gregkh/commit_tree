workqueue: WORKER_REBIND is no longer necessary for idle rebinding

Now both worker destruction and idle rebinding remove the worker from
idle list while it's still idle, so list_empty(&worker->entry) can be
used to test whether either is pending and WORKER_DIE to distinguish
between the two instead making WORKER_REBIND unnecessary.

Use list_empty(&worker->entry) to determine whether destruction or
rebinding is pending.  This simplifies worker state transitions.

WORKER_REBIND is not needed anymore.  Remove it.
