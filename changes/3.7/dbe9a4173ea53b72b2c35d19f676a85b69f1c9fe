scm: Don't use struct ucred in NETLINK_CB and struct scm_cookie.

Passing uids and gids on NETLINK_CB from a process in one user
namespace to a process in another user namespace can result in the
wrong uid or gid being presented to userspace.  Avoid that problem by
passing kuids and kgids instead.

- define struct scm_creds for use in scm_cookie and netlink_skb_parms
  that holds uid and gid information in kuid_t and kgid_t.

- Modify scm_set_cred to fill out scm_creds by heand instead of using
  cred_to_ucred to fill out struct ucred.  This conversion ensures
  userspace does not get incorrect uid or gid values to look at.

- Modify scm_recv to convert from struct scm_creds to struct ucred
  before copying credential values to userspace.

- Modify __scm_send to populate struct scm_creds on in the scm_cookie,
  instead of just copying struct ucred from userspace.

- Modify netlink_sendmsg to copy scm_creds instead of struct ucred
  into the NETLINK_CB.
