[SCSI] zfcp: Adapt to new FC_PORTSPEED semantics

Commit a9277e7783651d4e0a849f7988340b1c1cf748a4
"[SCSI] scsi_transport_fc: Getting FC Port Speed in sync with FC-GS"
changed the semantics of FC_PORTSPEED defines to
FDMI port attributes of FC-HBA/SM-HBA
which is different from the previous bit reversed
Report Port Speed Capabilities (RPSC) ELS of FC-GS/FC-LS.

Zfcp showed "10 Gbit" instead of "4 Gbit" for supported_speeds.
It now uses explicit bit conversion as the other LLDs already
do, in order to be independent of the kernel bit semantics.
