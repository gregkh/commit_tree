MPILIB: Provide count_leading/trailing_zeros() based on arch functions

Provide count_leading/trailing_zeros() macros based on extant arch bit scanning
functions rather than reimplementing from scratch in MPILIB.

Whilst we're at it, turn count_foo_zeros(n, x) into n = count_foo_zeros(x).

Also move the definition to asm-generic as other people may be interested in
using it.
