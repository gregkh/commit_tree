ia64/PCI: Use hotplug-safe pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot()

Following code has a race window between pci_find_bus() and pci_get_slot()
if PCI hotplug operation happens between them which removes the pci_bus.
So use PCI hotplug safe interface pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() instead,
which also reduces code complexity.

    struct pci_bus *pci_bus = pci_find_bus(domain, busno);
    struct pci_dev *pci_dev = pci_get_slot(pci_bus, devfn);
