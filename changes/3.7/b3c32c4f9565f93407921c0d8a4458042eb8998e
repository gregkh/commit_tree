PCI/PM: Fix proc config reg access for D3cold and bridge suspending

In https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48981
Peter reported that /proc/bus/pci/??/??.? does not work for 3.6.
This is because the device configuration space registers are
not accessible if the corresponding parent bridge is suspended or
the device is put into D3cold state.

This is the same as /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:??:??.?/config access
issue.  So the function used to solve sysfs issue is used to solve
this issue.

This patch moves pci_config_pm_runtime_get()/_put() from pci/pci-sysfs.c
to pci/pci.c and makes them extern so they can be used by both the
sysfs and proc paths.
