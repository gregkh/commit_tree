of/address: sparc: Declare of_address_to_resource() as an extern function for sparc again

This bug-fix makes sure that of_address_to_resource is defined extern for sparc
so that the sparc-specific implementation of of_address_to_resource() is once
again used when including include/linux/of_address.h in a sparc context. A
number of drivers in mainline relies on this function working for sparc.

The bug was introduced in a850a7554442f08d3e910c6eeb4ee216868dda1e, "of/address:
add empty static inlines for !CONFIG_OF". Contrary to that commit title, the
static inlines are added for !CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS, and CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS is never
defined for sparc. This is good behavior for the other functions in
include/linux/of_address.h, as the extern functions defined in
drivers/of/address.c only gets linked when OF_ADDRESS is configured. However,
for of_address_to_resource there exists a sparc-specific implementation in
arch/sparc/arch/sparc/kernel/of_device_common.c
