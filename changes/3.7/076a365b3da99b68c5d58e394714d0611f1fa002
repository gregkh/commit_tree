uprobes: Do not delete uprobe if uprobe_unregister() fails

delete_uprobe() must not be called if register_for_each_vma(false)
fails to remove all breakpoints, __uprobe_unregister() is correct.
The problem is that register_for_each_vma(false) always returns 0
and thus this logic does not work.

1. Change verify_opcode() to return 0 rather than -EINVAL when
   unregister detects the !is_swbp insn, we can treat this case
   as success and currently unregister paths ignore the error
   code anyway.

2. Change remove_breakpoint() to propagate the error code from
   write_opcode().

3. Change register_for_each_vma(is_register => false) to remove
   as much breakpoints as possible but return non-zero if
   remove_breakpoint() fails at least once.
