staging: comedi: adl_pci6208: use the 'board_name' for the resource name

Use the 'dev->board_name' instead of the 'dev->driver->driver_name'
as the resource name used when requesing the pci regions in
comedi_pci_enable(). The board_name has a closer affinity to the
card.

Also, remove the dev_err() message when comedi_pci_enable() fails.
It's just noise and doesn't actually tell the real reason why the
call failed. It could have failed either the pci_enable_device()
or the pci_request_regions().
