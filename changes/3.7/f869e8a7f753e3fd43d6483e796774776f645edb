expose a low-level variant of fd_install() for binder

Similar situation to that of __alloc_fd(); do not use unless you
really have to.  You should not touch any descriptor table other
than your own; it's a sure sign of a really bad API design.

As with __alloc_fd(), you *must* use a first-class reference to
struct files_struct; something obtained by get_files_struct(some task)
(let alone direct task->files) will not do.  It must be either
current->files, or obtained by get_files_struct(current) by the
owner of that sucker and given to you.
