mm, slob: Add support for kmalloc_track_caller()

Currently slob falls back to regular kmalloc for this case.
With this patch kmalloc_track_caller() is correctly implemented,
thus tracing the specified caller.

This is important to trace accurately allocations performed by
krealloc, kstrdup, kmemdup, etc.
