mm: compaction: abort compaction loop if lock is contended or run too long

isolate_migratepages_range() might isolate no pages if for example when
zone->lru_lock is contended and running asynchronous compaction. In this
case, we should abort compaction, otherwise, compact_zone will run a
useless loop and make zone->lru_lock is even contended.

An additional check is added to ensure that cc.migratepages and
cc.freepages get properly drained whan compaction is aborted.
