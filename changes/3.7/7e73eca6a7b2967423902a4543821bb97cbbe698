TTY: move cdev_add to tty_register_device

We need the /dev/ node not to be available before we call
tty_register_device. Otherwise we might race with open and
tty_struct->port might not be available at that time.

This is not an issue now, but would be a problem after "TTY: use
tty_port_register_device" is applied.
