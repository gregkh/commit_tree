mtd: nand: split BB marker options decoding into its own function

When detecting NAND parameters, the code gets a little ugly so that the
logic is obscured. Try to remedy that by moving code to separate functions
that have well-defined purposes.

This patch splits the bad block marker options detection into its own function,
away from the other parameters (e.g., chip size, page size, etc.).
