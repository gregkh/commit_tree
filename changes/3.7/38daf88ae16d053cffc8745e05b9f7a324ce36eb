mxser: allow overlapping vector

For many cards, this saves some IO space because interrupt status port
has precedence over the rest of ports on the card. Hence it can be
mapped to a hole in I/O ports.

Here we add a kernel parameter which allows that if a user wants to.
But they need to explicitly enable it by a module parameter.
