ARM: Add irqtime accounting support

Add support for irq time accounting.  This commit prepares ARM by adding
the call to enable_sched_clock_irqtime() in sched_clock().  We introduce
a new kernel parameter - irqtime - which takes an integer.  -1 for auto,
0 for disabled, and 1 for enabled.  Auto mode selects IRQ accounting if
we have a sched_clock() tick rate greater than 1MHz.

Frederic Weisbecker is working on a patch set which moves the
IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING into arch/, so that part is not incorporated into
this patch; this facility becomes available on ARM only when both this
patch and Frederic's patches are merged.
