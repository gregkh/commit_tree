mtd: nand: split simple ID decode into its own function

When detecting NAND parameters, the code gets a little ugly so that the
logic is obscured. Try to remedy that by moving code to separate functions
that have well-defined purposes.

This patch splits out the simple ID decode functionality, where all the
information regarding NAND size/blocksize/pagesize/oobsize/busw is encoded in
the first two bytes of the ID string.
