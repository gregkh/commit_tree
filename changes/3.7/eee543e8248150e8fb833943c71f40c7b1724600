i2c-mux: Add support for device auto-detection

Let I2C bus segments behind multiplexers have a class. This allows for
device auto-detection on these segments. As long as parent segments
don't share the same class, it should be fine.

I implemented support in drivers i2c-mux-gpio and i2c-mux-pca954x. I
left i2c-mux-pca9541 and i2c-mux-pinctrl alone for the moment as I
don't know if this feature makes sense for the use cases of these
drivers.
