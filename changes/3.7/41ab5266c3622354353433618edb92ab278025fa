powerpc: Add trap_nr to thread_struct

Add thread_struct.trap_nr and use it to store the last exception
the thread experienced. In this patch, we populate the field at
various places where we force_sig_info() to the process.

This is also used in uprobes to determine if the probed instruction
caused an exception.
