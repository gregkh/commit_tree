x86: Fix __user annotations in asm/sys_ia32.h

Fix the following sparse warnings:

  sys_ia32.c:293:38: warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces)
  sys_ia32.c:293:38:    expected unsigned int [noderef] [usertype] <asn:1>*stat_addr
  sys_ia32.c:293:38:    got unsigned int *stat_addr

Ironically, sys_ia32.h was introduced to fix sparse warnings but
missed that one.
