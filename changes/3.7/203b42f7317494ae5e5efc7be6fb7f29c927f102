workqueue: make deferrable delayed_work initializer names consistent

Initalizers for deferrable delayed_work are confused.

* __DEFERRED_WORK_INITIALIZER()
* DECLARE_DEFERRED_WORK()
* INIT_DELAYED_WORK_DEFERRABLE()

Rename them to

* __DEFERRABLE_WORK_INITIALIZER()
* DECLARE_DEFERRABLE_WORK()
* INIT_DEFERRABLE_WORK()

This patch doesn't cause any functional changes.
