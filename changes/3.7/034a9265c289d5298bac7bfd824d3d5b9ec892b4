perf report: Enable integrated annotation only if possible

The integrated annotation feature is supported only in TUI mode.  Also
it should be enabled with 'symbol' sort key otherwise resulting hist
entry doesn't need to have same symbol as of a sample so that it can
fail on hist_entry__inc_addr_samples with -ERANGE.

You can easily see it when start perf report TUI without symbol* sort
key.  This patch fixes the problem.
