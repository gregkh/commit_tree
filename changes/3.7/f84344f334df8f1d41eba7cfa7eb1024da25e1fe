rbd: separate mapping info in rbd_dev

Several fields in a struct rbd_dev are related to what is mapped, as
opposed to the actual base rbd image.  If the base image is mapped
these are almost unneeded, but if a snapshot is mapped they describe
information about that snapshot.

In some contexts this can be a little bit confusing.  So group these
mapping-related field into a structure to make it clear what they
are describing.

This also includes a minor change that rearranges the fields in the
in-core image header structure so that invariant fields are at the
top, followed by those that change.
