timer: Generalize timer->base flags handling

To prepare for addition of another flag, generalize timer->base flags
handling.

* Rename from TBASE_*_FLAG to TIMER_* and make them LU constants.

* Define and use TIMER_FLAG_MASK for flags masking so that multiple
  flags can be handled correctly.

* Don't dereference timer->base directly even if
  !tbase_get_deferrable().  All two such places are already passed in
  @base, so use it instead.

* Make sure tvec_base's alignment is large enough for timer->base
  flags using BUILD_BUG_ON().
