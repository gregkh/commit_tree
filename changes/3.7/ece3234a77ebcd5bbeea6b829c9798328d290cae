x86: dt: Use linear irq domain for ioapic(s)

The former conversion to irq_domain_add_legacy() did not fully work
since we miss the irq decs for NR_IRQS_LEGACY+.

Ideally we could use irq_domain_add_simple() or the no-map variant (and
program the virq <-> line mapping directly into ioapic) but this would
require a different irq lookup in "do_IRQ()" and won't work with ACPI
without changes. So this is probably easiest for everyone.
