gma500/cdv: Add eDP support

Introduce the eDP support into the driver.

This has been reworked a bit because kernel driver proper uses encoder/connectors
while the legacy Intel driver uses the old output stuff.

It also diverges on the backlight handling. The legacy Intel driver adds a panel
abstraction based upon the i915 one. It's only really used for backlight bits
and we have a perfectly good backlight abstraction which can extend instead.
