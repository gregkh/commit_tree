be2net: create RSS rings even in multi-channel configs

Changes from commit df505e were incorrectly over-written by commit 10ef9ab.
Fixing the same.

Change log of the original fix:
    Currently RSS rings are not created in a multi-channel config.
    RSS rings can be created on one (out of four) interfaces per port in a
    multi-channel config. Doing this insulates the driver from a FW bug wherin
    multi-channel config is wrongly reported even when not enabled. This also
    helps performance in a multi-channel config, as one interface per port gets
    RSS rings.
