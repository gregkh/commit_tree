PCI/PM: Resume device before shutdown

Some actions during shutdown need device to be in D0 state, such as
MSI shutdown etc, so resume device before shutdown.

Without this patch, a device may not be enumerated after a kexec
because the corresponding bridge is not in D0, so that
configuration space of the device is not accessible.
