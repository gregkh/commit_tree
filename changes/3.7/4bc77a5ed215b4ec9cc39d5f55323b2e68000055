powerpc: Export memory limit via device tree

The powerpc kernel doesn't export the memory limit enforced by 'mem='
kernel parameter. This is required for building the ELF header in
kexec-tools to limit the vmcore to capture only the used memory. On
powerpc the kexec-tools depends on the device-tree for memory related
information, unlike /proc/iomem on the x86.

Without this information, the kexec-tools assumes the entire System
RAM and vmcore creates an unnecessarily larger dump.

This patch exports the memory limit, if present, via
chosen/linux,memory-limit
property, so that the vmcore can be limited to the memory limit.

The prom_init seems to export this value in the same node. But doesn't
really
appear there.  Also the memory_limit gets adjusted with the processing of
crashkernel= parameter. This patch makes sure we get the actual limit.

The kexec-tools will use the value to limit the 'end' of the memory
regions.

Tested this patch on ppc64 and ppc32(ppc440) with a kexec-tools
patch by Mahesh.
