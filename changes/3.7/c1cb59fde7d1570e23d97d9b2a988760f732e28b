ARM: at91: set i2c_board_info.type to "ds1339" directly

The single element of the cpu9krea_i2c_devices array (of type struct
i2c_board_info) has its "type" member set twice. First to "rtc-ds1307"
(through the I2C_BOARD_INFO macro) and then directly to "ds1339". Just
set it (once and) directly to "ds1339" instead.
