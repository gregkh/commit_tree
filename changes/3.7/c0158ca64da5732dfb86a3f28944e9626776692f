workqueue: cancel_delayed_work() should return %false if work item is idle

57b30ae77b ("workqueue: reimplement cancel_delayed_work() using
try_to_grab_pending()") made cancel_delayed_work() always return %true
unless someone else is also trying to cancel the work item, which is
broken - if the target work item is idle, the return value should be
%false.

try_to_grab_pending() indicates that the target work item was idle by
zero return value.  Use it for return.  Note that this brings
cancel_delayed_work() in line with __cancel_work_timer() in return
value handling.
