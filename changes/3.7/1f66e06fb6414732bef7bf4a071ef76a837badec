ARM: 7524/1: support syscall tracing

As specified by ftrace-design.txt, TIF_SYSCALL_TRACEPOINT was
added, as well as NR_syscalls in asm/unistd.h.  Additionally,
__sys_trace was modified to call trace_sys_enter and
trace_sys_exit when appropriate.

Tests #2 - #4 of "perf test" now complete successfully.
