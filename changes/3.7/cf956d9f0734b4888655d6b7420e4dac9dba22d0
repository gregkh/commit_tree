ARM: OMAP3: fix workaround for EMU clockdomain

Commit b71c721 (ARM: OMAP2+: clockdomain/hwmod: add workaround for EMU
clockdomain idle problems) added a workaround for the EMU clock domain on
OMAP3/4 devices to prevent the clock domain for transitioning while it is
in use.

In the proposed patch [1] code was added to the omap3xxx_clkdm_clk_enable()
and omap3xxx_clkdm_clk_disable() functions to check for the flag
CLKDM_MISSING_IDLE_REPORTING and perform the appropriate action. However, in the
merged patch it appears that this code was added to the omap2_clkdm_clk_enable()
and omap2_clkdm_clk_disable() functions by mistake.
