staging: tidspbridge: ioremap dsp sync addr

Change the type of sync_addr to 'void __iomem *' and ioremap the
physical address in the shared memory so we can access it using
_raw_*. While at it, drop 'dw_' prefix.

Fix the warning associated with dsp's sync_addr:

warning: passing argument 2 of '__raw_writel' makes pointer from integer without a cast
../io.h:88: note: expected 'volatile void *' but argument is of type 'u32'
