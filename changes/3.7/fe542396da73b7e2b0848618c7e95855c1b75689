[SCSI] sd: Ensure we correctly disable devices with unknown protection type

We set the capacity to zero when we discovered a device formatted with
an unknown DIF protection type. However, the read_capacity code would
override the capacity and cause the device to be enabled regardless.

Make sd_read_protection_type() return an error if the protection type is
unknown. Also prevent duplicate printk lines when the device is being
revalidated.
