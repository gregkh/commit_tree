md/raid1: Don't release reference to device while handling read error.

When we get a read error, we arrange for raid1d to handle it.
Currently we release the reference on the device.  This can result
in
   conf->mirrors[read_disk].rdev
being NULL in fix_read_error, if the device happens to get removed
before the read error is handled.

So instead keep the reference until the read error has been fully
handled.
