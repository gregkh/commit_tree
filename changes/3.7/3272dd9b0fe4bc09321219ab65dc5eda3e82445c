of/net/mdio-gpio: Fix pdev->id issue when using devicetrees.

When the mdio-gpio driver is probed via device trees, the platform
device id is set as -1, However the pdev->id is re-used as bus-id for
while creating mdio gpio bus.
So
For device tree case the mdio-gpio bus name appears as "gpio-ffffffff"
where as
for non-device tree case the bus name appears as "gpio-<bus-num>"

Which means the bus_id is fixed in device tree case, so we can't have
two mdio gpio buses via device trees. Assigning a logical bus number
via device tree solves the problem and the bus name is much consistent
with non-device tree bus name.

Without this patch
1. we can't support two mdio-gpio buses via device trees.
2. we should always pass gpio-ffffffff as bus name to phy_connect, very
different to non-device tree bus name.

So, setting up the bus_id via aliases from device tree is the right
solution and other drivers do similar thing.
