userns: Convert struct dquot dq_id to be a struct kqid

Change struct dquot dq_id to a struct kqid and remove the now
unecessary dq_type.

Make minimal changes to dquot, quota_tree, quota_v1, quota_v2, ext3,
ext4, and ocfs2 to deal with the change in quota structures and
signatures.  The ocfs2 changes are larger than most because of the
extensive tracing throughout the ocfs2 quota code that prints out
dq_id.

quota_tree.c:get_index is modified to take a struct kqid instead of a
qid_t because all of it's callers pass in dquot->dq_id and it allows
me to introduce only a single conversion.

The rest of the changes are either just replacing dq_type with dq_id.type,
adding conversions to deal with the change in type and occassionally
adding qid_eq to allow quota id comparisons in a user namespace safe way.
