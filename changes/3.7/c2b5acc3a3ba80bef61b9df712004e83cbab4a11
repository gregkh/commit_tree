PCI: Remove the fakephp driver

The fakephp driver was scheduled for removal in 2011.

Fakephp presented /sys/bus/pci/slots/.../power files for every PCI
function.  Writing "0" to one of these files logically removed the device
from the system.  The PCI core now provides the same functionality with
/sys/bus/pci/devices/.../remove.
