kernel/sys.c: call disable_nonboot_cpus() in kernel_restart()

As kernel_power_off() calls disable_nonboot_cpus(), we may also want to
have kernel_restart() call disable_nonboot_cpus().  Doing so can help
machines that require boot cpu be the last alive cpu during reboot to
survive with kernel restart.

This fixes one reboot issue seen on imx6q (Cortex-A9 Quad).  The machine
requires that the restart routine be run on the primary cpu rather than
secondary ones.  Otherwise, the secondary core running the restart
routine will fail to come to online after reboot.
