[media] s5p-fimc: fimc-lite: Propagate frame format on the subdev

When setting image format on subdev's sink pad there was no
propagation to the source pad. This resulted in wrong reported
format on the source pad and wrong device configuration when
used from subdev interace level only. Correct this by propagating
format from the sink to the source pad.
