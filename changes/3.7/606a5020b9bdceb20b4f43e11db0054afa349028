workqueue: gut flush[_delayed]_work_sync()

Now that all workqueues are non-reentrant, flush[_delayed]_work_sync()
are equivalent to flush[_delayed]_work().  Drop the separate
implementation and make them thin wrappers around
flush[_delayed]_work().

* start_flush_work() no longer takes @wait_executing as the only left
  user - flush_work() - always sets it to %true.

* __cancel_work_timer() uses flush_work() instead of wait_on_work().
