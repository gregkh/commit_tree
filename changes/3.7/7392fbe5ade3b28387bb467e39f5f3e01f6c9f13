aoe: update internal version number to 49

The internal version number of the aoe driver appears in a console message
when the driver loads and is usually obtained by the user with the
userland aoe-version tool, part of the aoetools.[1]

Although this patchset includes bugfixes backported from higher-numbered
versions published on the coraid.com website, it is a form of version 49.
