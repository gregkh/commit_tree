x86/reboot: Remove quirk entry for SBC FITPC

Remove the quirk for the SBC FITPC. It seems ot have been
required when the default was kbd reboot, but no longer required
now that the default is acpi reboot. Furthermore, BIOS reboot no
longer works for this board as of 2.6.39 or any of the 3.x
kernels.
