JFFS2: don't fail on bitflips in OOB

JFFS2 was designed without thought for OOB bitflips, it seems, but they
can occur and will be reported to JFFS2 via mtd_read_oob()[1]. We don't
want to fail on these transactions, since the data was corrected.

[1] Few drivers report bitflips for OOB-only transactions. With such
    drivers, this patch should have no effect.
