KVM: x86 emulator: access GPRs on demand

Instead of populating the entire register file, read in registers
as they are accessed, and write back only the modified ones.  This
saves a VMREAD and VMWRITE on Intel (for rsp, since it is not usually
used during emulation), and a two 128-byte copies for the registers.
