rbtree: move augmented rbtree functionality to rbtree_augmented.h

Provide rb_insert_augmented() and rb_erase_augmented() through a new
rbtree_augmented.h include file.  rb_erase_augmented() is defined there as
an __always_inline function, in order to allow inlining of augmented
rbtree callbacks into it.  Since this generates a relatively large
function, each augmented rbtree user should make sure to have a single
call site.
