HID: hidraw: put old deallocation mechanism in place

This basically reverts commit 4fe9f8e203fda. It causes multiple problems,
namely:

- after rmmod/modprobe cycle of bus driver, the input is not claimed any
  more. This is likely because of misplaced hid_hw_close()
- it causes memory corruption on hidraw_list

As original patch author is not responding to requests to fix his patch,
and the original deallocation mechanism is not exposing any problems, I
am reverting back to it.
