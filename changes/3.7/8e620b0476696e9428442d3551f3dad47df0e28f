arm64: Distinguish between user and kernel XN bits

On AArch64, the meaning of the XN bit has changed to UXN (user). The PXN
(privileged) bit must be set to prevent kernel execution. Without the
PXN bit set, the CPU may speculatively access device memory. This patch
ensures that all the mappings that the kernel must not execute from
(including user mappings) have the PXN bit set.
