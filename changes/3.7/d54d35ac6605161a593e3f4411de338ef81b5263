aoe: failover remote interface based on aoe_deadsecs parameter

The aoe_deadsecs module parameter allows the user to specify a hard limit
on the number of seconds an AoE command can be retransmitted before the
AoE block device is considered to have failed.

Using aoe_deadsecs to determine the time we try using a different remote
interface helps to ensure that the hard limit is not reached before we've
tried to recover by sending to a different remote port.

As a data storage target, the AoE target is unambiguously identified by
its {major, minor} AoE address tuple, and an AoE target can have multiple
MAC addresses.  However, note that "target" in the driver code and
comments means a {major, minor, MAC address} tuple, as in "somewhere to
send packets".
