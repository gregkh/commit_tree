USB: ark3116: fix NULL-pointer dereference

Fix NULL-pointer dereference at release by replacing attach and release
with port_probe and port_remove.

Since commit 0998d0631001288 (device-core: Ensure drvdata = NULL when no
driver is bound) the port private data is NULL when release is called.

Compile-only tested.
