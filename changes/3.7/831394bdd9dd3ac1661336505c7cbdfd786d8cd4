perf header: Prepare tracepoint events regardless of name

Current perf_evlist__set_tracepoint_names is a misnomer because it finds
and sets correspoding event_format in addition to the name.  So skipping
it when a event has set name already caused a trouble.

Rename it and set name only a event doesn't have one.
