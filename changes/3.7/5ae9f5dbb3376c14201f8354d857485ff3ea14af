arm: mach-mv78xx0: use plus instead of or for address definitions

Since we are going to use IOMEM() to define many base virtual
addresses, we can no longer use binary or to define the individual
register addresses ("binary or" arithmetic on pointers is not
allowed). Instead, use the more conventional plus operator to do so.

The binary or operators were actually not useful because the low-order
bits of the base address were always zero, so the usage of the binary
or operators was effectively identical to a plus operator.
