mfd: max8925: Remove array in regulator platform data

Remove array in parent's platform data. Use struct regulator_init_data
as regulator device's platform data directly. So a lot of pdata are
added into parent's platform data. And voltage out register offset
is used as IORESOURCE_REG to distinguish different regualtor devices.
