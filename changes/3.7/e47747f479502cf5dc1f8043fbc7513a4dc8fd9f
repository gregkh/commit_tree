powerpc/powernv: Fix overrunning segment tracing array

There're 2 arrays introduced to trace which PE has occupied the
corresponding resource (I/O or MMIO) segment. However, we didn't
allocate enough memory for them and that possiblly leads to PE
descriptor corruption.

The patch fixes that by allocating enough memory for those 2 arrays.
