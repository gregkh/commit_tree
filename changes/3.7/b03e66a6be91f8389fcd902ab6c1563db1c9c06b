sata_svw: check DMA start bit before reset

If kdump is triggered with pending IO, controller may not respond causing
kdump to fail.

http://marc.info/?l=linux-ide&m=133032255424658&w=2

During error recovery ata_do_dev_read_id never completes due hang
in mmio_insw.

ata_do_dev_read_id
 ata_sff_data_xfer
  ioread16_rep
   mmio_insw

if DMA start bit is cleared before reset, PIO command is successful
and kdump succeeds.
