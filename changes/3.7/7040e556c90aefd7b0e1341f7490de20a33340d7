staging: add Silicom Bypass driver

The Silicom Bypass Network Interface Cards (NICs) are network cards with
paired ports (2 or 4).  The pairs either act as a "wire" allowing the
network packets to pass or insert the device in between the two ports.
When paired with the on-board hardware watchdog or other failsafe, they
provide high availability for the network in the face of software
outages or maintenance.
