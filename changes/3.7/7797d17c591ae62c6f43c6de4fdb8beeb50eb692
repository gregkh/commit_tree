arm64: ptrace: make structure padding explicit for debug registers

The user_hwdebug_state structure contains implicit padding to conform to
the alignment requirements of the AArch64 ABI (namely that aggregates
must be aligned to their most aligned member).

This patch fixes the ptrace functions operating on struct
user_hwdebug_state so that the padding is handled correctly.
