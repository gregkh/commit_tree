Input: wacom - report correct touch contact size for I5/Bamboo

This changes how the touch packets for Intuos5 and 3rd-gen Bamboo
are interpreted, so that proper values for the MAJOR and MINOR
axes are reported. Instead of using the amplitude field (data[6]),
we use the size field (data[5]) and do some calculation to
transform it from a scaled-down area into axis lengths.

Note that even though we assume a circular contact, both MAJOR and
MINOR are reported since the resolution of the X and Y axes differ.
