s390: add support for transactional memory

Allow user-space processes to use transactional execution (TX).
If the TX facility is available user space programs can use
transactions for fine-grained serialization based on the data
objects that are referenced during a transaction. This is
useful for lockless data structures and speculative compiler
optimizations.
