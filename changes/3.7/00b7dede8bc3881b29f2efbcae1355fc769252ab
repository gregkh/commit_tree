ARM: drop experimental status for hotplug and Thumb2

Both these features have been around for a long time now, and haven't
had any recent issues brought up.  So lets drop their experimental
status.

In any case, hotplugis  selected by other non-experimental options
which then cause a Kconfig warning.
