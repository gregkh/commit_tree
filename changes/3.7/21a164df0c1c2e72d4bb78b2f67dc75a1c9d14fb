ALSA: hdspm - Report external rate in slave mode on PCI MADI

As a follow-up to a97bda7d29d02a2e9c6609d0947b15e55f5200e5, report the
external sample rate as system_sample_rate when in slave mode.

For PCIe MADI cards, the DDS value automatically contains the external
sample rate, but the PCI version needs this manual workaround.
