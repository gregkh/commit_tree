Bluetooth: Remove unneeded code

This patch removes some unneeded code from hci_cs_le_create_conn.

If the hci_conn is not found, it means this LE connection attempt
was triggered by a thrid-party tool (e.g. hcitool). We should not
create this new hci_conn in LE Create Connection command status
event since it is already properly handled in LE Connection
Complete event.
