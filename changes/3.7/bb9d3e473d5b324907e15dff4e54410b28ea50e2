x86, microcode: Drop uci->mc check on resume path

Remove the uci->mc check on the cpu resume path because the low-level
drivers do that anyway.

More importantly, though, this fixes a contrived and obscure but still
important case. Imagine the following:

* boot machine, no new microcode in /lib/firmware

* a subset of the CPUs is offlined

* in the meantime, user puts new fresh microcode container into
/lib/firmware and reloads it by doing
$ echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload

* offlined cores come back online and they don't get the newer microcode
applied due to this check.

Later patches take care of the issue on AMD.

While at it, cleanup code around it.
