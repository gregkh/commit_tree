ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: add sad2d hwmod

SAD2D stands for the die to die interface, and is used for communicating
with the optional stacked modem. This hwmod is added in preparation for
the d2d_idle move from pm34xx.c to hwmod data.

[paul@pwsan.com: SAD2D presumably doesn't exist on non-OMAP34xx/OMAP36xx,
 so only add it to the OMAP34xx/OMAP36xx lists]
