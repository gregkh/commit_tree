rcu: Prevent initialization race in rcutorture kthreads

When you do something like "t = kthread_run(...)", it is possible that
the kthread will start running before the assignment to "t" happens.
If the child kthread expects to find a pointer to its task_struct in "t",
it will then be fatally disappointed.  This commit therefore switches
such cases to kthread_create() followed by wake_up_process(), guaranteeing
that the assignment happens before the child kthread starts running.
