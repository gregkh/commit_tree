serial: omap: unlock the port lock

This patch unlocks the port lock before calling a serial_core API
and re-acquires the port lock after calling it.
This patch fixes a system freeze issue seen when the serial_core
API uart_write_wakeup() eventually attempts to acquire the port lock
already acquired by omap serial interrupt handler.
