workqueue: use system_highpri_wq for unbind_work

To speed cpu down processing up, use system_highpri_wq.
As scheduling priority of workers on it is higher than system_wq and
it is not contended by other normal works on this cpu, work on it
is processed faster than system_wq.

tj: CPU up/downs care quite a bit about latency these days.  This
    shouldn't hurt anything and makes sense.
