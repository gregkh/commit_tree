ARM: dt: tegra: cardhu: split dts file for support multiple board versions

There is multiple version of cardhu starting from A01 to A07.
Cardhu A01 and A03 are not supported. Cardhu A02 will have
different sets of GPIOs for fixed regulator compare to
cardhu A04. The Cardhu A05, A06, A07 are compatibe with A04.
Based on cardhu version, the related dts file need to be chosen
like for cardhu A02, use tegra30-cardhu-a02.dts, cardhu A04 and
more, use tegra30-cardhu-a04.dts.
This patch create the DTS file A02 and A04 and convert tegra30-cardhu.dts
as dts include file.
