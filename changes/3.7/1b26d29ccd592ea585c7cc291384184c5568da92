[libata] scsi: implement MODE SELECT command

The cache_type file in sysfs lets users configure the disk cache in
write-through or write-back modes.  However, ata disks do not support
writing to the file because they do not implement the MODE SELECT
command.

This patch adds a translation from MODE SELECT (for the caching page
only) to the ATA SET FEATURES command.  The set of changeable parameters
answered by MODE SENSE is also adjusted accordingly.
