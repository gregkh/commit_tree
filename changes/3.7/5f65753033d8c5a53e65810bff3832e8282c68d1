NFSv4 set open access operation call flag in nfs4_init_opendata_res

nfs4_open_recover_helper zeros the nfs4_opendata result structures, removing
the result access_request information which leads to an XDR decode error.

Move the setting of the result access_request field to nfs4_init_opendata_res
which sets all the other required nfs4_opendata result fields and is shared
between the open and recover open paths.
