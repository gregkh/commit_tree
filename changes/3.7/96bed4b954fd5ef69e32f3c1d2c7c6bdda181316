bnx2x,cnic: use FW 7.8.2

This patch moves the bnx2x and cnic drivers into using FW 7.8.2
which was recently submitted into the linux-firmware tree.

A short summary of minor bugs fixed by this FW:
 1. In switch dependent mode, fix several issues regarding inner vlan
    vs. DCB priorities.
 2. iSCSI - not all packets were completed on a forward channel.
 3. DCB - fixed for 4-port devices.
 4. Fixed false parity reported in CAM memories when operating near -5%
    on the 1.0V core supply.
 5. ETS default settings are set to fairness between traffic classes
    (rather than strict priority), and uses the same chip receive buffer
    configuration for both PFC and pause.

For a complete list of fixes made by this FW, see commit 236367db
in the linux-firmware git repository.
