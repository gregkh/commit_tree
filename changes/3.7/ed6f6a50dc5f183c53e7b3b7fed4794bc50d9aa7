uprobes: Kill set_orig_insn()->is_swbp_at_addr()

Unlike set_swbp(), set_orig_insn()->is_swbp_at_addr() makes sense,
although it can't prevent all confusions.

But the usage of is_swbp_at_addr() is equally confusing, and it adds
the extra get_user_pages() we can avoid.

This patch removes set_orig_insn()->is_swbp_at_addr() but changes
write_opcode() to do the necessary checks before replace_page().

Perhaps it also makes sense to ensure PAGE_MAPPING_ANON in unregister
case.

find_active_uprobe() becomes the only user of is_swbp_at_addr(),
we can change its semantics.
