staging:iio:dummy: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

If the config contains CONFIG_IIO_BUFFER=y and CONFIG_IIO_SIMPLE_DUMMY_BUFFER=n
iio_simple_dummy_configure_buffer() is stubbed out and iio_buffer_register() is
not. As a result we try to register a buffer which has not been configured.
This will causes a NULL pointer deref in iio_buffer_register. To solve this
issue move the iio_buffer_register() call to iio_simple_dummy_configure_buffer(),
so it will only be called if iio_simple_dummy_configure_buffer() has been called.
