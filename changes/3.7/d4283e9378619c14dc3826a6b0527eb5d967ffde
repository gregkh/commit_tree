workqueue: make queueing functions return bool

All queueing functions return 1 on success, 0 if the work item was
already pending.  Update them to return bool instead.  This signifies
better that they don't return 0 / -errno.

This is cleanup and doesn't cause any functional difference.

While at it, fix comment opening for schedule_work_on().
