perf symbols: Convert dso__load_syms to take 2 symsrc's

To properly handle platforms with an opd section, both a runtime image
(which contains the opd section but possibly lacks symbols) and a symbol
image (which probably lacks an opd section but has symbols).

The next patch ("perf symbol: use both runtime and debug images")
adjusts the callsite in dso__load() to take advantage of being able to
pass both runtime & debug images.

Assumptions made here:

 - The opd section, if it exists in the runtime image, has headers in
   both the runtime image and the debug/syms image.

 - The index of the opd section (again, only if it exists in the runtime
   image) is the same in both the runtime and debug/symbols image.

Both of these are true on RHEL, but it is unclear how accurate they are
in general (on platforms with function descriptors in opd sections).
