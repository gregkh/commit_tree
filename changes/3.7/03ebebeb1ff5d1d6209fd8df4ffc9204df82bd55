KVM: x86 emulator: Leave segment limit and attributs alone in real mode

When loading a segment in real mode, only the base and selector must
be modified.  The limit needs to be left alone, otherwise big real mode
users will hit a #GP due to limit checking (currently this is suppressed
because we don't check limits in real mode).
