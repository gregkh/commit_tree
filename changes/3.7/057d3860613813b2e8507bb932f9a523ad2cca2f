drm/i915: Change forcewake timeout to 2ms

A designer familiar with the hardware has stated that the forcewake
timeout can theoretically be as high as a little over 1ms. Therefore we
modify our code to use 2ms (appropriate fudge and because we don't want
to round down).

Hopefully this can't prevent spurious timeouts.
