pch_gbe: Fix build error by selecting all the possible dependencies.

Fengguang reported a kernel build failure as following:
drivers/built-in.o: In function `pch_gbe_ioctl':
pch_gbe_main.c:(.text+0x510370): undefined reference to `pch_ch_control_write'
pch_gbe_main.c:(.text+0x510393): undefined reference to `pch_ch_control_write'
pch_gbe_main.c:(.text+0x5103b3): undefined reference to `pch_ch_control_write'
...

It's a regression by commit da1586461. The root cause is that
the CONFIG_PPS is not set there, consequently CONFIG_PTP_1588_CLOCK
can not be set anyway, which finally causes ptp_pch and pch_gbe_main
build failures.

As David prefers to use *select* to fix such module co-dependency issues,
this patch explicitly selects all the possible dependencies of PCH_PTP.
