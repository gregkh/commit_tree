ASoC/ARM: Davinci: McASP: split asp header into platform and audio specific

Davinci McASP header & driver are shared by few OMAP platforms (like
TI81xx, AM335x). Splitting asp header into Davinci platform specific
header and Audio specific header helps to share them across platforms.

Audio specific defines is moved to to common
<linux/platform_data/davinci_asp.h> so that the header can be
accessed by all related platforms.

While here, correct the header usage (remove multiple header
re-definitions and unused headers) and remove platform names from
structures comments and enum. Also some some coding style errors.
