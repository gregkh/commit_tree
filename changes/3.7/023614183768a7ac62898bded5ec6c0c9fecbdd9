thermal: add generic cpufreq cooling implementation

This patchset introduces a new generic cooling device based on cpufreq
that can be used on non-ACPI platforms.  As a proof of concept, we have
drivers for the following platforms using this mechanism now:

 * Samsung Exynos (Exynos4 and Exynos5) in the current patchset.
 * Freescale i.MX (git://git.linaro.org/people/amitdanielk/linux.git imx6q_thermal)

There is a small change in cpufreq cooling registration APIs, so a minor
change is needed for Freescale platforms.

Brief Description:

1) The generic cooling devices code is placed inside driver/thermal/*
   as placing inside acpi folder will need un-necessary enabling of acpi
   code.  This code is architecture independent.

2) This patchset adds generic cpu cooling low level implementation
   through frequency clipping.  In future, other cpu related cooling
   devices may be added here.  An ACPI version of this already exists
   (drivers/acpi/processor_thermal.c) .But this will be useful for
   platforms like ARM using the generic thermal interface along with the
   generic cpu cooling devices.  The cooling device registration API's
   return cooling device pointers which can be easily binded with the
   thermal zone trip points.  The important APIs exposed are,

   a) struct thermal_cooling_device *cpufreq_cooling_register(
        struct cpumask *clip_cpus)
   b) void cpufreq_cooling_unregister(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev)

3) Samsung exynos platform thermal implementation is done using the
   generic cpu cooling APIs and the new trip type.  The temperature sensor
   driver present in the hwmon folder(registered as hwmon driver) is moved
   to thermal folder and registered as a thermal driver.

A simple data/control flow diagrams is shown below,

Core Linux thermal <----->  Exynos thermal interface <----- Temperature Sensor
          |                             |
         \|/                            |
  Cpufreq cooling device <---------------

TODO:
*Will send the DT enablement patches later after the driver is merged.

This patch:

Add support for generic cpu thermal cooling low level implementations
using frequency scaling up/down based on the registration parameters.
Different cpu related cooling devices can be registered by the user and
the binding of these cooling devices to the corresponding trip points can
be easily done as the registration APIs return the cooling device pointer.
The user of these APIs are responsible for passing clipping frequency .
The drivers can also register to recieve notification about any cooling
action called.
