Staging: ipack/bridges/tpci200: Use the TPCI200 in big endian mode.

During initialization we configure the TPCI200 so it does not swap data
lanes on IndustryPack module access.  The read and write functions are
changed accordingly.

We are taking this approach in the hope that all IP Carriers are able to
present the Module memory layout unchanged.  We can thus directly access
the memory and registers of IP Modules without having to rely on the
read and write wrappers currently exposed in ipack_bus_opts.  A later
patch will convert the existing driver and remove the wrappers.
