ext4: add online resizing support for meta_bg and 64-bit file systems

This patch adds support for resizing file systems with the meta_bg and
64bit features.

[ Added a fix by tytso to fix a divide by zero when resizing a
  filesystem from 14 TB to 18TB.  Also fixed overhead accounting for
  meta_bg file systems.]
