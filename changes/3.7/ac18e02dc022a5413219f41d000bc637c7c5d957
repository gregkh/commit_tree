ARM: shmobile: Rework adding devices to PM domains on Mackerel

On SH7372 and Mackerel devices are added to PM domains through a
series of rmobile_add_device_to_domain_td() calls where the last
argument is always the same.  This is quite inefficient, so add
a common function for adding devices to PM domains that reads the
domain-device pairs information from a table and use it during SH7372
and Mackerel initialization.
