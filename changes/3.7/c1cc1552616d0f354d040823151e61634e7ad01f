arm64: MMU initialisation

This patch contains the initialisation of the memory blocks, MMU
attributes and the memory map. Only five memory types are defined:
Device nGnRnE (equivalent to Strongly Ordered), Device nGnRE (classic
Device memory), Device GRE, Normal Non-cacheable and Normal Cacheable.
Cache policies are supported via the memory attributes register
(MAIR_EL1) and only affect the Normal Cacheable mappings.

This patch also adds the SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP initialisation.
