Btrfs: do not allocate chunks as agressively

Swinging this pendulum back the other way.  We've been allocating chunks up
to 2% of the disk no matter how much we actually have allocated.  So instead
fix this calculation to only allocate chunks if we have more than 80% of the
space available allocated.  Please test this as it will likely cause all
sorts of ENOSPC problems to pop up suddenly.  Thanks,
