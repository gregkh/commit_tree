ipv4: avoid passing NULL to inet_putpeer() in icmpv4_xrlim_allow()

inet_getpeer_v4() can return NULL under OOM conditions, and while
inet_peer_xrlim_allow() is OK with a NULL peer, inet_putpeer() will
crash.

This code path now uses the same idiom as the others from:
1d861aa4b3fb08822055345f480850205ffe6170 ("inet: Minimize use of
cached route inetpeer.").
