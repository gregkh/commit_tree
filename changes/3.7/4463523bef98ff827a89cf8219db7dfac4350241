NFC: LLCP raw socket support

This adds support for socket of type SOCK_RAW to LLCP.
sk_buff are copied and sent to raw sockets with a 2 bytes extra header:
The first byte header contains the nfc adapter index.
The second one contains flags:
- 0x01 - Direction (0=RX, 1=TX)
- 0x02-0x80 - Reserved
A raw socket has to be explicitly bound to a nfc adapter. This is achieved
by specifying the adapter index to be bound to in the dev_idx field of the
sockaddr_nfc_llcp struct passed to bind().
