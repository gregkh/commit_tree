staging: comedi: new adl_pci7x3x driver

Currently the ADLink PCI-7230 and PCI-7432 Isolated Digital
I/O Boards are supported using two drivers (adl_pci7230 and
adl_pci7432). These drivers are very similar and only differ
in the total number of di/do channels provided.

This driver combines the support for both boards into one
common driver. In addition, it adds PCI PnP support for the
other boards in the ADLink PCI-723x and PCI-743x series.

This driver only supports the comedi PCI auto config attach
mechanism. The legacy attach using the comedi_config utility
is not supported or required by this driver.
