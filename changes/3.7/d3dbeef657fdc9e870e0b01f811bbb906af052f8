powerpc: Rename 64-bit PVR constants to PVR_foo

We have an old FIXME in reg.h which points out that we should standardise
on PVR_foo for our PVR #defines. Currently we use PVR_ on 32-bit and PV_
on 64-bit.

So do that rename and remove the FIXME.

Seeing as we're touching all but one usage of __is_processor(), rename it
to something less ugly and more indicative of what it does, which is
simply to check the PVR version.
