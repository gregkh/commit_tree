mdio: translation of MMD EEE registers to/from ethtool settings

The helper functions which translate IEEE MDIO Manageable Device (MMD)
Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE) registers 3.20, 7.60 and 7.61 to and from
the comparable ethtool supported/advertised settings will be needed by
drivers other than those in PHYLIB (e.g. e1000e in a follow-on patch).

In the same fashion as similar translation functions in linux/mii.h, move
these functions from the PHYLIB core to the linux/mdio.h header file so the
code will not have to be duplicated in each driver needing MMD-to-ethtool
(and vice-versa) translations.  The function and some variable names have
been renamed to be more descriptive.

Not tested on the only hardware that currently calls the related functions,
stmmac, because I don't have access to any.  Has been compile tested and
the translations have been tested on a locally modified version of e1000e.
