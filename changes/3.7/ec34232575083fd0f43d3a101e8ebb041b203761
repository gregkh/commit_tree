tcp: fix retransmission in repair mode

Currently if a socket was repaired with a few packet in a write queue,
a kernel bug may be triggered:

kernel BUG at net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:2330!
RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff8155784f>] tcp_retransmit_skb+0x5ff/0x610

According to the initial realization v3.4-rc2-963-gc0e88ff,
all skb-s should look like already posted. This patch fixes code
according with this sentence.

Here are three points, which were not done in the initial patch:
1. A tcp send head should not be changed
2. Initialize TSO state of a skb
3. Reset the retransmission time

This patch moves logic from tcp_sendmsg to tcp_write_xmit. A packet
passes the ussual way, but isn't sent to network. This patch solves
all described problems and handles tcp_sendpages.
