mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: disable CMD23 for some Freescale SoCs

CMD23 causes lots of errors in kernel on some freescale SoCs
(P1020, P1021, P1022, P1024, P1025 and P4080) when MMC card used,
which is because these controllers does not support CMD23,
even on the SoCs which declares CMD23 is supported.
Therefore, we'll not use CMD23.
