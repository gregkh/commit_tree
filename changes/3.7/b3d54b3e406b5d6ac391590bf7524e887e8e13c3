netfilter: combine ipt_NETMAP and ip6t_NETMAP

Combine more modules since the actual code is so small anyway that the
kmod metadata and the module in its loaded state totally outweighs the
combined actual code size.

IP_NF_TARGET_NETMAP becomes a compat option; IP6_NF_TARGET_NETMAP
is completely eliminated since it has not see a release yet.
