ext4: don't copy non-existent gdt blocks when resizing

The resize code was copying blocks at the beginning of each block
group in order to copy the superblock and block group descriptor table
(gdt) blocks.  This was, unfortunately, being done even for block
groups that did not have super blocks or gdt blocks.  This is a
complete waste of perfectly good I/O bandwidth, to skip writing those
blocks for sparse bg's.
