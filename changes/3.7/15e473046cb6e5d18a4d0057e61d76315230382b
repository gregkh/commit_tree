netlink: Rename pid to portid to avoid confusion

It is a frequent mistake to confuse the netlink port identifier with a
process identifier.  Try to reduce this confusion by renaming fields
that hold port identifiers portid instead of pid.

I have carefully avoided changing the structures exported to
userspace to avoid changing the userspace API.

I have successfully built an allyesconfig kernel with this change.
