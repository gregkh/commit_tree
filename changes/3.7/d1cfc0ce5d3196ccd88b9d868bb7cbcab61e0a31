hvc_vio: Improve registration of udbg backend

The pseries hvterm driver only registers a udbg backend (for xmon and
other low level debugging mechanisms) when hvc0 is recognized as the
firmware console at boot time, not if it's detected later on, for
example because the firmware is using a graphics card.

This can make debugging challenging especially under X11, and there's
really no good reason for that limitation, so let's hookup udbg
whenever hvc0 is detected instead.
