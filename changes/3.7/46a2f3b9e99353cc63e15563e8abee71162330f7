Smack: setprocattr memory leak fix

The data structure allocations being done in prepare_creds
are duplicated in smack_setprocattr. This results in the
structure allocated in prepare_creds being orphaned and
never freed. The duplicate code is removed from
smack_setprocattr.

Targeted for git://git.gitorious.org/smack-next/kernel.git
