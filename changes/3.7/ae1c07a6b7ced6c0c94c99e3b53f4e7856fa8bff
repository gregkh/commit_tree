igb: Remove artificial restriction on RQDPC stat reading

For some reason the reading of the RQDPC register was being artificially
limited to 4K.  Instead of limiting the value we should read the value and
add the full amount.  Otherwise this can lead to a misleading number of
dropped packets when the actual value is in fact much higher.
