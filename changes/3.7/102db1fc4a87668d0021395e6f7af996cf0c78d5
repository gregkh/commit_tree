staging:wlan-ng: cleanup prism2sta_commsqual_defer and hfa384x_drvr_getconfig

the function prism2sta_commsqual_defer defines a goto done lable, which just
jumps to end of function, which we can achieve with out it

the hfa384x_drvr_getconfig doesn't need the result variable, we can
remove and just return the function
