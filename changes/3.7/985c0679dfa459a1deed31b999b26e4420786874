arm64: Generic timers support

This patch adds support for the ARM generic timers with A64 instructions
for accessing the timer registers. It uses the physical counter as the
clock source and the virtual counter as sched_clock.

The timer frequency can be specified via DT or read from the CNTFRQ_EL0
register. The physical counter is also accessible from user space
allowing fast gettimeofday() implementation.
