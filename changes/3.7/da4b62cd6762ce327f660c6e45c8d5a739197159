MIPS: perf: Add cpu feature bit for PCI (performance counter interrupt)

The PCI (Program Counter Interrupt) bit in the "cause" register
is mandatory for MIPS32R2 cores, but has also been added to some R1
cores (BMIPS5000). This change adds a cpu feature bit to make it
easier to check for and use this feature.
