tty: of_serial: add no-loopback-test property

The loopback test mode is not implemented in all
NS16550 compatible UARTs. The 8250 driver uses the
UPF_SKIP_TEST flag to indicate this, however it is
not possible to set this flag via device-tree.

Add a new 'no-loopback-test' property, and modify
the of_serial driver to set the UPF_SKIP_TEST flag
if the property is present.
