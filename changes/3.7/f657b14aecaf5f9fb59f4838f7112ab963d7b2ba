staging: comedi: daqboard2000: remove struct daqboard2000_hw

In this driver the PCI bar 2 resource is being ioremap'ed to a
void * in the private data. This void * is then being cast to a
struct daqboard2000_hw * that defines all the registers used by
the driver.

This is causing a number of sparse warnings similar to:

  warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address space)
     expected void const volatile [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
     got void *

Change the type in the private data to void __iomem * to correctly
store the ioremap'ed address.

Remove struct daqboard2000_hw and change the contents to #define's
for the register memory map.
