net: remove delay at device dismantle

I noticed extra one second delay in device dismantle, tracked down to
a call to dst_dev_event() while some call_rcu() are still in RCU queues.

These call_rcu() were posted by rt_free(struct rtable *rt) calls.

We then wait a little (but one second) in netdev_wait_allrefs() before
kicking again NETDEV_UNREGISTER.

As the call_rcu() are now completed, dst_dev_event() can do the needed
device swap on busy dst.

To solve this problem, add a new NETDEV_UNREGISTER_FINAL, called
after a rcu_barrier(), but outside of RTNL lock.

Use NETDEV_UNREGISTER_FINAL with care !

Change dst_dev_event() handler to react to NETDEV_UNREGISTER_FINAL

Also remove NETDEV_UNREGISTER_BATCH, as its not used anymore after
IP cache removal.
