drm/i915: Set guardband clipping workaround bit in the right register.

A previous patch, namely:

    drm/i915: implement w/a for incorrect guarband clipping

accidentally set bit 5 in 3D_CHICKEN, which has nothing to do with
clipping.  This patch changes it to be set in 3D_CHICKEN3, where it
belongs.

The game "Dante" demonstrates random clipping issues when guardband
clipping is enabled and bit 5 of 3D_CHICKEN3 isn't set.  So the
workaround is actually necessary.
