packet: Report fanout status via diag engine

Reported value is the same reported by the FANOUT getsockoption, but
unlike it, the absent fanout setup results in absent nlattr, rather
than in nlattr with zero value. This is done so, since zero fanout
report may mean both -- no fanout, and fanout with both id and type zero.
