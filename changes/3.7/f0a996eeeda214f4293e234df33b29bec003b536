mips,kgdb: fix recursive page fault with CONFIG_KPROBES

This fault was detected using the kgdb test suite on boot and it
crashes recursively due to the fact that CONFIG_KPROBES on mips adds
an extra die notifier in the page fault handler.  The crash signature
looks like this:

kgdbts:RUN bad memory access test
KGDB: re-enter exception: ALL breakpoints killed
Call Trace:
[<807b7548>] dump_stack+0x20/0x54
[<807b7548>] dump_stack+0x20/0x54

The fix for now is to have kgdb return immediately if the fault type
is DIE_PAGE_FAULT and allow the kprobe code to decide what is supposed
to happen.
