rcu: Adjust for unconditional ->completed assignment

Now that the rcu_node structures' ->completed fields are unconditionally
assigned at grace-period cleanup time, they should already have the
correct value for the new grace period at grace-period initialization
time.  This commit therefore inserts a WARN_ON_ONCE() to verify this
invariant.
