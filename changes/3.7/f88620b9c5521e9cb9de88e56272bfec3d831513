sparc64: Fix deficiencies in sun4v error reporting.

Missing error types, attributes, and report fields.  Pad out
to 64-bytes.

Make string reporting cleaner and easier to extend in the future using
"const char *" arrays that index by either bit position, or absolute
field value.

Report the raw 64-byte error report as a sequence of u64s before the
annotated version.

Only report fields which are valid, given the context and the
attribute bits which are set.

For shutdown requests, use the local copy of the error report not the
one we just freed up back to the queue.  Also, use orderly_poweroff()
just like the Domain Services shutdown request code does.

If the real-address reported is "-1" (unknown) try to disassemble the
instruction to report the effective address of the access.  Only do
this in privileged mode.
