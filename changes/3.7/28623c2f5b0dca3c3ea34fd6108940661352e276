ext4: grow the s_group_info array as needed

Previously we allocated the s_group_info array with enough space for
any future possible growth of the file system via online resize.  This
is unfortunate because it wastes memory, and it doesn't work for the
meta_bg scheme, since there is no limit based on the number of
reserved gdt blocks.  So add the code to grow the s_group_info array
as needed.
