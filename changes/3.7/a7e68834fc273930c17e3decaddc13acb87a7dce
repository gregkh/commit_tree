mtd: nand: use ECC, if present, when scanning OOB

scan_read_raw_oob() is used in only in places where the MTD_OPS_PLACE_OOB mode
is preferable to MTD_OPS_RAW mode, so use MTD_OPS_PLACE_OOB instead.
MTD_OPS_PLACE_OOB provides the same functionality with the potential[1] added
bonus of error correction.

This brings scan_block_full() in line with scan_block_fast() so that they
both read bad block markers with MTD_OPS_PLACE_OOB. This can help in
preventing 0xff markers (in good blocks) from being interpreted as bad
block indicators in the presence of a single bitflip.

Note that ECC error codes (EUCLEAN or EBADMSG) are already silently
ignored in all users of scan_read_raw_oob().

[1] Few  drivers perform proper error correction on OOB data. In those
    cases, the use of MTD_OPS_RAW vs. MTD_OPS_PLACE_OOB is not
    significant.
