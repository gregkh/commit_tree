aoe: become I/O request queue handler for increased user control

To allow users to choose an elevator algorithm for their particular
workloads, change from a make_request-style driver to an
I/O-request-queue-handler-style driver.

We have to do a couple of things that might be surprising.  We manipulate
the page _count directly on the assumption that we still have no guarantee
that users of the block layer are prohibited from submitting bios
containing pages with zero reference counts.[1] If such a prohibition now
exists, I can get rid of the _count manipulation.

Just as before this patch, we still keep track of the sk_buffs that the
network layer still hasn't finished yet and cap the resources we use with
a "pool" of skbs.[2]

Now that the block layer maintains the disk stats, the aoe driver's
diskstats function can go away.
