sparc64: Fix bit twiddling in sparc_pmu_enable_event().

There was a serious disconnect in the logic happening in
sparc_pmu_disable_event() vs. sparc_pmu_enable_event().

Event disable is implemented by programming a NOP event into the PCR.

However, event enable was not reversing this operation.  Instead, it
was setting the User/Priv/Hypervisor trace enable bits.

That's not sparc_pmu_enable_event()'s job, that's what
sparc_pmu_enable() and sparc_pmu_disable() do .

The intent of sparc_pmu_enable_event() is clear, since it first clear
out the event type encoding field.  So fix this by OR'ing in the event
encoding rather than the trace enable bits.
