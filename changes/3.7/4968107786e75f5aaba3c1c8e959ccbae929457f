ASoC: add definations for compressed operations

Here we update the asoc structures to add compress stream definations
First the struct snd_soc_dai_driver adds a new member to indicate if the dai is
compressed or pcm. Next we add a new structre the struct snd_soc_compr_ops in
the struct snd_soc_dai_link. This is to be used for machine driver to perform
any opertaions required for setting up compressed audio streams

next is the compressed data operations, they are added using struct
snd_compr_ops in the struct snd_soc_platform_driver.
