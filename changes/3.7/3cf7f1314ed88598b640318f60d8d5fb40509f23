mtd: bcm47part driver for BCM47XX chipsets

This driver provides parser detecting partitions on BCM47XX flash
memories. It has many differences in comparison to BCM63XX, like:
1) Different CFE with no more trivial MAGICs
2) More partitions types (board_data, ML, POT)
3) Supporting more than 1 flash on a device
which resulted in decision of writing new parser.

It uses generic mtd interface and was successfully tested with Netgear
WNDR4500 router which has 2 flash memories: serial one and NAND one.
