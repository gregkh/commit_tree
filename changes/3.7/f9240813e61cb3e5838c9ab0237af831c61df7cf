tools/power/turbostat: add option to count SMIs, re-name some options

Counting SMIs is popular, so add a dedicated "-s" option to do it,
and juggle some of the other option letters.

-S is now system summary (was -s)
-c is 32 bit counter (was -d)
-C is 64-bit counter (was -D)
-p is 1st thread in core (was -c)
-P is 1st thread in package (was -p)

bump the minor version number
