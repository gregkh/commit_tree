usb/core: use bin2bcd() for bcdDevice in RH

The kernel's version number is used as decimal in the bcdDevice field of
the RH descriptor. For kernel version v3.12 we would see 3.0c in lsusb.
I am not sure how important it is to stick with bcd values since this is
this way since we started git history and nobody complained (however back
then we reported only 2.6).
