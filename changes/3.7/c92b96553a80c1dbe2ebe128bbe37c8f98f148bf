ipv4: Add FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH

Add flag to request that output route should be
returned with known rt_gateway, in case we want to use
it as nexthop for neighbour resolving.

	The returned route can be cached as follows:

- in NH exception: because the cached routes are not shared
	with other destinations
- in FIB NH: when using gateway because all destinations for
	NH share same gateway

	As last option, to return rt_gateway!=0 we have to
set DST_NOCACHE.
