rcu: Fix obsolete rcu_initiate_boost() header comment

Commit 1217ed1b (rcu: permit rcu_read_unlock() to be called while holding
runqueue locks) made rcu_initiate_boost() restore irq state when releasing
the rcu_node structure's ->lock, but failed to update the header comment
accordingly.  This commit therefore brings the header comment up to date.
