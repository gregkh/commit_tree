DM RAID: Fix comparison of index and quantity for "rebuild" parameter

DM RAID: Fix comparison of index and quantity for "rebuild" parameter

The "rebuild" parameter takes an index argument that starts counting from
zero.  The conditional used to validate the index was using '>' rather than
'>=', leaving the door open for an index value that would be 1 too large.
