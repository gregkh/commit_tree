workqueue: rename manager_mutex to assoc_mutex

Now that manager_mutex's role has changed from synchronizing manager
role to excluding hotplug against manager, the name is misleading.

As it is protecting the CPU-association of the gcwq now, rename it to
assoc_mutex.

This patch is pure rename and doesn't introduce any functional change.
