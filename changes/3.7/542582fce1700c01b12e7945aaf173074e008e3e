rbd: bio_chain_clone() cleanups

In bio_chain_clone(), at the end of the function the bi_next field
of the tail of the new bio chain is nulled.  This isn't necessary,
because if "tail" is non-null, its value will be the last bio
structure allocated at the top of the while loop in that function.
And before that structure is added to the end of the new chain, its
bi_next pointer is always made null.

While touching that function, clean a few other things:
    - define each local variable on its own line
    - move the definition of "tmp" to an inner scope
    - move the modification of gfpmask closer to where it's used
    - rearrange the logic that sets the chain's tail pointer
