Makefile: Documentation for external tool should be correct

If one includes documentation for an external tool, it should be
correct.  This is not:

1. Overriding the input to rngd should typically be neither
   necessary nor desired.  This is especially so since newer
   versions of rngd support a number of different *types* of sources.
2. The default kernel-exported device is called /dev/hwrng not
   /dev/hwrandom nor /dev/hw_random (both of which were used in the
   past; however, kernel and udev seem to have converged on
   /dev/hwrng.)

Overall it is better if the documentation for rngd is kept with rngd
rather than in a kernel Makefile.
