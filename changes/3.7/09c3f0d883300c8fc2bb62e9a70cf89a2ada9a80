x86, microcode: Cleanup cpu hotplug notifier callback

Mask out CPU_TASKS_FROZEN bit so that all _FROZEN cases can be dropped.
Also, add some more comments as to why CPU_ONLINE falls through to
CPU_DOWN_FAILED (no break), and for the CPU_DEAD case. Realign debug
printks better.

Idea blatantly stolen from a tglx patch:
