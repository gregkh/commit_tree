s390/sysinfo,stsi: change return code handling

Change return code handling of the stsi() function:

In case function code 0 was specified the return value is the
current configuration level (already shifted). That way all
the code that actually copied the stsi_0() function can go
away.

Otherwise the return value is 0 (success) or negative to
indicate an error (currently only -EOPNOTSUPP).

Also stsi() is no longer an inline function. The function is
not performance critical, but every caller would generate an
exception table entry for this function.
