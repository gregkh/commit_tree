firmware loader: introduce cache_firmware and uncache_firmware

This patches introduce two kernel APIs of cache_firmware and
uncache_firmware, both of which take the firmware file name
as the only parameter.

So any drivers can call cache_firmware to cache the specified
firmware file into kernel memory, and can use the cached firmware
in situations which can't request firmware from user space.
