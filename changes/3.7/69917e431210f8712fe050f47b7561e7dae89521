Btrfs: fix a bug in parsing return value in logical resolve

In logical resolve, we parse extent_from_logical()'s 'ret' as a kind of flag.

It is possible to lose our errors because
(-EXXXX & BTRFS_EXTENT_FLAG_TREE_BLOCK) is true.

I'm not sure if it is on purpose, it just looks too hacky if it is.
I'd rather use a real flag and a 'ret' to catch errors.
