xen pv-on-hvm: add pfn_is_ram helper for kdump

Register pfn_is_ram helper speed up reading /proc/vmcore in the kdump
kernel. See commit message of 997c136f518c ("fs/proc/vmcore.c: add hook
to read_from_oldmem() to check for non-ram pages") for details.

It makes use of a new hvmop HVMOP_get_mem_type which was introduced in
xen 4.2 (23298:26413986e6e0) and backported to 4.1.1.

The new function is currently only enabled for reading /proc/vmcore.
Later it will be used also for the kexec kernel. Since that requires
more changes in the generic kernel make it static for the time being.
