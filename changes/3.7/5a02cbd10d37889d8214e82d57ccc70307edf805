ixgbe: Roll RSC code into non-EOP code

This change moves the RSC code into the non-EOP descriptor handling
function. The main motivation behind this change is to help reduce the
overhead in the non-RSC case. Previously the non-RSC path code would
always be checking for append count even if RSC had been disabled. Now
this code is completely skipped in a single conditional check instead of
having to make two separate checks.
