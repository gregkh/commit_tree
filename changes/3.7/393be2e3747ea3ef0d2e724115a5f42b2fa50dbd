perf symbols: Support minimal build without libelf

Now we have isolated all ELF-specific stuff, it's possible to build
without libelf. The output binary can do most of jobs but lacks (user
level) symbol information - kernel symbols are still accessable thanks
to the kallsyms.

To build perf without libelf (elfutils), give NO_LIBELF=1 to make.

For now, only 'perf probe' command is removed since it depends on
libelf/libdw heavily.
