userns: Convert quota netlink aka quota_send_warning

Modify quota_send_warning to take struct kqid instead a type and
identifier pair.

When sending netlink broadcasts always convert uids and quota
identifiers into the intial user namespace.  There is as yet no way to
send a netlink broadcast message with different contents to receivers
in different namespaces, so for the time being just map all of the
identifiers into the initial user namespace which preserves the
current behavior.

Change the callers of quota_send_warning in gfs2, xfs and dquot
to generate a struct kqid to pass to quota send warning.  When
all of the user namespaces convesions are complete a struct kqid
values will be availbe without need for conversion, but a conversion
is needed now to avoid needing to convert everything at once.
