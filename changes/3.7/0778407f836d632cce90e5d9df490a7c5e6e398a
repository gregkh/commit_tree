powerpc/booke: Separate out restore_e5500/setup_e5500 routines.

For the 64 bit case separate out e5500 cpu_setup and cpu_restore functions.
The cpu_setup function (for the primary core) is passed the cpu_spec
pointer, which is not there in case of the cpu_restore function. Also, in
our case we will have to manipulate the CPU_FTR_EMB_HV flag on the primary
core.
