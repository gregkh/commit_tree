tty/serial/amba-pl011: Quiesce interrupts in poll_get_char

We need to quiesce interrupts in the poll_get_char routine, otherwise,
if used with KGDB NMI debugger, we'll keep reentering the NMI.

Quiescing interrupts is pretty straightforward, except for TXIM
interrupt. The interrupt has "ready to transmit" meaning, so it's
almost always raised, and the only way to silence it is to mask it. But
that's OK, ops->start_tx will unmask it.
