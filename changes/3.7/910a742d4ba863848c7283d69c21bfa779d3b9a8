rbtree: performance and correctness test

This small module helps measure the performance of rbtree insert and
erase.

Additionally, we run a few correctness tests to check that the rbtrees
have all desired properties:

- contains the right number of nodes in the order desired,
- never two consecutive red nodes on any path,
- all paths to leaf nodes have the same number of black nodes,
- root node is black
