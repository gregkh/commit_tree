[SCSI] mpt2sas: Provide sysfs attribute to report Backup Rail Monitor Status

A new sysfs shost attribute called "BMR_status" is implemented to
report Backup Rail Monitor status.

This attribute is located in the path
        /sys/class/scsi_host/host#/BMR_status

when reading this adapter attribute, then driver will output the state
of GPIO[24]. It returns "0" if BMR is healthy and it returns "1" for failure.

if it returns an empty string then it means that there was an error while
obtaining the BMR status. Then check dmesg for what error has occured.
