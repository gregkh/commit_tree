m68k: always set stack frame format for ColdFire on thread start

The stack frame "format" field needs to be explicitly set on thread creation
on ColdFire. For a normal long word aligned user stack pointer the frame
format is 0x4.

We were doing this for non-MMU ColdFire, but not for the case with MMU enabled.
So fix it so we always do it if targeting ColdFire.

The old code happend to rely on the stack frame format being inhereted from
the process calling exec. Furture changes means that may not always work,
so we really do want to set it explicitly.
