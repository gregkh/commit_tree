x86, boot: Explicitly include autoconf.h for hostprogs

The hostprogs need access to the CONFIG_* symbols found in
include/generated/autoconf.h.  But commit abbf1590de22 ("UAPI: Partition
the header include path sets and add uapi/ header directories") replaced
$(LINUXINCLUDE) with $(USERINCLUDE) which doesn't contain the necessary
include paths.

This has the undesirable effect of breaking the EFI boot stub because
the #ifdef CONFIG_EFI_STUB code in arch/x86/boot/tools/build.c is
never compiled.

It should also be noted that because $(USERINCLUDE) isn't exported by
the top-level Makefile it's actually empty in arch/x86/boot/Makefile.
