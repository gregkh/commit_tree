pda_power: Remove ac_draw_failed goto and label

A previous patch added the ac_draw_failed goto and label to
pda_power_probe(). The goto would be invoked after a failed call to
regulator_get().

However the way ac_draw is used - always after a check for NULL - suggests
that a failed call to regulator_get() was not fatal.

This patch removes the ac_draw_failed goto and label, partly reverting the
previous patch.

This patch also removes the assignment of an error code to ret after a
failed call to regulator_get(), since the error code is now never used.
