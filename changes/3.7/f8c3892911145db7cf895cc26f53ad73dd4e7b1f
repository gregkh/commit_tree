rbd: move rbd_opts to struct rbd_device

The rbd options don't really apply to the ceph client.  So don't
store a pointer to it in the ceph_client structure, and put them
(a struct, not a pointer) into the rbd_dev structure proper.

Pass the rbd device structure to rbd_client_create() so it can
assign rbd_dev->rbdc if successful, and have it return an error code
instead of the rbd client pointer.
