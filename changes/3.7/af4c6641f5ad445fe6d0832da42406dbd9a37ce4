net sched: Pass the skb into change so it can access NETLINK_CB

cls_flow.c plays with uids and gids.  Unless I misread that
code it is possible for classifiers to depend on the specific uid and
gid values.  Therefore I need to know the user namespace of the
netlink socket that is installing the packet classifiers.  Pass
in the rtnetlink skb so I can access the NETLINK_CB of the passed
packet.  In particular I want access to sk_user_ns(NETLINK_CB(in_skb).ssk).

Pass in not the user namespace but the incomming rtnetlink skb into
the the classifier change routines as that is generally the more useful
parameter.
