Powerpc 8xx CPM_UART setting MAXIDL register proportionaly to baud rate

MAXIDL is the timeout after which a receive buffer is closed when not full if
no more characters are received. We calculate it from the baudrate so that the
duration is always the same at standard rates: about 4ms. At 9600 bauds it gives
a timeout of 4 characters, which is the timeout on the 8250 UART.
