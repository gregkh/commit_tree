drm/i915: robustify edp_pll_on/off

With the previous patch to clean up where exactly these two functions
are getting called, this patch can tackle the enable/disable code
itself:

- WARN if the port enable bit is in the wrong state or if the edp pll
  bit is in the wrong state, just for paranoia's sake.
- Don't disable the edp pll harder in the modeset functions just for
  fun.
- Don't set the edp pll enable flag in intel_dp->DP in modeset, do
  that while changing the actual hw state. We do the same with the
  actual port enable bit, so this is a bit more consistent.
- Track the current DP register value when setting things up and add
  some comments how intel_dp->DP is used in the disable code.

v2: Be more careful with resetting intel_dp->DP - otherwise dpms
off->on will fail spectacularly, becuase we enable the eDP port when
we should only enable the eDP pll.
