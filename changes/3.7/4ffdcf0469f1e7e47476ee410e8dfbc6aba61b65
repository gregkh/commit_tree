mmc: bfin_sdh: Add support for new RSI controller in bf60x

In BF60x RSI controller:
1) MMR read/write width differs.
2) PWR and CTL MMRs are merged to together.
3) ROD and PD_DAT3 bit masks are obsolete.
4) New RSI block size MMR is defined.
5) The definition of DMA descriptor set size is changed.
6) set_ios should powers up controller in 2 steps.

In addition, this patch cleans up the spin locks.
