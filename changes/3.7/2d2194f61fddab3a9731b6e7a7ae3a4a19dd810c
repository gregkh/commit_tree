xfs: reduce code duplication handling inode32/64 options

Add xfs_set_inode32() to be used to enable inode32 allocation mode. this
will reduce the amount of duplicated code needed to mount/remount a
filesystem with inode32 option.  This patch also changes
xfs_set_inode64() to return the maximum AG number that inodes can be
allocated instead of set mp->m_maxagi by itself, so that the behaviour
is the same as xfs_set_inode32().  This simplifies code that calls these
functions and needs to know the maximum AG that inodes can be allocated
in.
