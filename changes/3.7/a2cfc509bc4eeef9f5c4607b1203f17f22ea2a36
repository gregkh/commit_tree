ARM: OMAP3+: hwmod: Add AM33XX HWMOD data

This patch adds HWMOD data for all the peripherals of
AM335X device and also hooks up to the existing OMAP framework.

hwmod data has been already been cleaned up for the recent
changes in clocktree, where all leaf nodes have been removed,
since with modulemode based control, both clock and hwmod
interface does same thing. This reduces the code size to large
extent and also avoids duplication of same control.
So instead of specifying module's leaf node as a main_clk,
now we are relying on parent clock of module's functional clock.

[paul@pwsan.com: removed period in hwmod device names; changed mmc2 main_clk
 to mmc_clk at Vaibhav's request; added trailing commas to structure
 records at Tony's request to deal with some rmk parsing issues; added
 OMAP_INTC_START to facilitate sparse-IRQ conversion]
