PM / Domains: Add power off/on function for system core suspend stage

Introduce function pm_genpd_syscore_switch() and two wrappers around
it, pm_genpd_syscore_poweroff() and pm_genpd_syscore_poweron(),
allowing the callers to let the generic PM domains framework know
that the given device is not necessary any more and its PM domain
can be turned off (the former) or that the given device will be
required immediately, so its PM domain has to be turned on (the
latter) during the system core (syscore) stage of system suspend
(or hibernation) and resume.

These functions will be used for handling devices registered as
clock sources and clock event devices that belong to PM domains.
