s390/mm,vmem: fix vmem_add_mem()/vmem_remove_range()

vmem_add_mem() should only then insert a large page if pmd_none() is true
for the specific entry. We might have a leftover from a previous mapping.
In addition make vmem_remove_range()'s page table walk code more complete
and fix a couple of potential endless loops (which can never happen :).
