powerpc: Change memory_limit from phys_addr_t to unsigned long long

There are some device-tree nodes, whose values are of type phys_addr_t.
The phys_addr_t is variable sized based on the CONFIG_PHSY_T_64BIT.

Change these to a fixed unsigned long long for consistency.

This patch does the change only for memory_limit.

The following is a list of such variables which need the change:

 1) kernel_end, crashk_size - in arch/powerpc/kernel/machine_kexec.c

 2) (struct resource *)crashk_res.start - We could export a local static
    variable from machine_kexec.c.

Changing the above values might break the kexec-tools. So, I will
fix kexec-tools first to handle the different sized values and then change
 the above.
