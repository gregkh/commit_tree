ASoC: Ux500: Enable ux500 MSP driver for Device Tree

Register both parts of the MSP driver from Device Tree so that they
are probed when Device Tree is enabled. Also, as there is platform
data involved, we ensure that there is allocated memory to place the
configuration into and that the correct information is extracted from
the DT binary.
