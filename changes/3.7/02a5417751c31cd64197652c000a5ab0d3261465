MIPS: tlbex: Deal with re-definition of label

The microassembler used in tlbex.c does not notice if a label is redefined
resulting in relocations against such labels silently missrelocated.
The issues exists since commit add6eb04776db4189ea89f596cbcde31b899be9d
[Synthesize TLB exception handlers at runtime.] in 2.6.10 and went unnoticed
for so long because the relocations for the affected branches got computed
to do something *almost* sensible.

The issue affects R4000, R4400, QED/IDT RM5230, RM5231, RM5260, RM5261,
RM5270 and RM5271 processors.
