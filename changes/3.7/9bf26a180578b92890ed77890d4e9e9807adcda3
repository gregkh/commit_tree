ARM: 7514/1: integrator: call common init function from machine

There is currently a common integrator_init() function set up
to be called from an arch_initcall(). The problem is that it is
using machine_is_integrator() which is not working with device
tree, let's call this from respective machine initilization
function and add a parameter to tell whether it's the
Integrator/AP or Integrator/CP instead.

There are still machine_is*() calls in the Integrator
machines directory, but this one needs to be fixed lest we
don't even get a UART console on the Integrator/AP after a
Device Tree boot.
