l2tp: fix oops in l2tp_eth_create() error path

When creating an L2TPv3 Ethernet session, if register_netdev() should fail for
any reason (for example, automatic naming for "l2tpeth%d" interfaces hits the
32k-interface limit), the netdev is freed in the error path.  However, the
l2tp_eth_sess structure's dev pointer is left uncleared, and this results in
l2tp_eth_delete() then attempting to unregister the same netdev later in the
session teardown.  This results in an oops.

To avoid this, clear the session dev pointer in the error path.
