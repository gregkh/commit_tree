mtd: nand: fix Samsung SLC NAND identification regression

A combination of the following two commits caused a regression in 3.7-rc1
when identifying some Samsung NAND, so that some previously working NAND
were no longer detected properly:

    commit e3b88bd604283ef83ae6e8f53622d5b1ffe9d43a
    mtd: nand: add generic READ ID length calculation functions

    commit e2d3a35ee427aaba99b6c68a56609ce276c51270
    mtd: nand: detect Samsung K9GBG08U0A, K9GAG08U0F ID

Particularly, a regression was seen on Samsung K9F2G08U0B, with the
following full 8-byte READ ID string:

    ec da 10 95 44 00 ec da

The basic problem is that Samsung manufactures both SLC and MLC NAND
that use a non-standard decoding table for deriving information from
their IDs. I have heuristically determined that all the chips that use
the new table have ID strings which wrap around after the 6th byte.
Unfortunately, I overlooked the fact that some older Samsung SLC (which
use a different decoding table) have "5 byte ID strings" which also wrap
around after the 6th byte.

This patch re-introduces a distinction between these old and new Samsung
NAND by checking that the 6th byte is non-zero, allowing both old and
new Samsung NAND to be detected properly.
