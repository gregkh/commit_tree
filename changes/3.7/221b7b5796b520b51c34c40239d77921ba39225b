pcmcia: synclink_cs: fix potential tty NULL dereference

tty_port_tty_get() can return NULL after port hangup that may happen anytime.
The patch adds checks that tty_port_tty_get() returns nonNULL around places
where tty is actually used.

I have no actual hardware to test the patch, so I have updated rx side
processing from common sense only.

v2: rx handling updated according Alan Cox feedback.
