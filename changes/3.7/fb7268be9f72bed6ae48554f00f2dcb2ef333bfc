PM / Domains: Make it possible to use names when adding subdomains

Add a new helper function, pm_genpd_add_subdomain_names(), allowing
the caller to add a subdomain to a generic PM domain using names for
domain identification (both domains have to be initialized before).

This function is useful for adding subdomains to PM domains whose
representations are stored in tables, when the caller doesn't know
the indices of the domain to add the subdomain to and of the
subdomain itself, but it knows the domains' names.
