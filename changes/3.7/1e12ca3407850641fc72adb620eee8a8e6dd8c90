staging: comedi: me_daq: use request_firmware()

This driver requires loading a firmware file for the fpga. This
is currently being done by passing the firmware data using the
COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl through the attach() hook in the driver.
This does not work for auto-configured PCI devices due to the
firmware loading options not being set in the comedi_devconfig
parameter passed to the driver.

Change the driver so it gets the firmware using request_firmware()
and ignore any firmware options passed in the comedi_devconfig.
