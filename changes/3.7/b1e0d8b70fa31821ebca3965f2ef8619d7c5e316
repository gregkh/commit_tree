kbuild: Fix gcc -x syntax

The correct syntax for gcc -x is "gcc -x assembler", not
"gcc -xassembler". Even though the latter happens to work, the former
is what is documented in the manual page and thus what gcc wrappers
such as icecream do expect.

This isn't a cosmetic change. The missing space prevents icecream from
recognizing compilation tasks it can't handle, leading to silent kernel
miscompilations.

Besides me, credits go to Michael Matz and Dirk Mueller for
investigating the miscompilation issue and tracking it down to this
incorrect -x parameter syntax.
