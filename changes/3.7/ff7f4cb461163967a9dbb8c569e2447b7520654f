GFS2: Consolidate free block searching functions

With the recently added block reservation code, an additional function
was added to search for free blocks. This had a restriction of only being
able to search for aligned extents of free blocks. As a result the
allocation patterns when reserving blocks were suboptimal when the
existing allocation of blocks for an inode was not aligned to the same
boundary.

This patch resolves that problem by adding the ability for gfs2_rbm_find
to search for extents of a particular minimum size. We can then use
gfs2_rbm_find for both looking for reservations, and also looking for
free blocks on an individual basis when we actually come to do the
allocation later on. As a result we only need a single set of code
to deal with both situations.

The function gfs2_rbm_from_block() is moved up rgrp.c so that it
occurs before all of its callers.

Many thanks are due to Bob for helping track down the final issue in
this patch. That fix to the rb_tree traversal and to not share
block reservations from a dirctory to its children is included here.
