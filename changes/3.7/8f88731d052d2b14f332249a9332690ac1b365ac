led-triggers: create a trigger for CPU activity

Attempting to consolidate the ARM LED code, this removes the
custom RealView LED trigger code to turn LEDs on and off in
response to CPU activity and replace it with a standard trigger.

(bryan.wu@canonical.com:
It introduces several syscore stubs into this trigger.
It also provides ledtrig_cpu trigger event stub in <linux/leds.h>.
Although it was inspired by ARM work, it can be used in other arch.)
