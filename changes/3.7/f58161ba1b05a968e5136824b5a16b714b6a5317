ALSA: usb-audio: Fix crash at re-preparing the PCM stream

There are bug reports of a crash with USB-audio devices when PCM
prepare is performed immediately after the stream is stopped via
trigger callback.  It turned out that the problem is that we don't
wait until all URBs are killed.

This patch adds a new function to synchronize the pending stop
operation on an endpoint, and calls in the prepare callback for
avoiding the crash above.
