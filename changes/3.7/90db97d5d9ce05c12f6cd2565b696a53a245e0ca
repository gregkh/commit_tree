staging: comedi: comedi_bond: remove boardinfo

The only field in the boardinfo for this driver is a pointer to the
board 'name'. This field is used by the comedi core to match against
the driver when doing a legacy attach. If a driver does not have any
boardinfo, the comedi core matches against the driver name.

Since the boardinfo name and driver name are identical we can simplify
this driver a bit bu just removing the boardinfo completely.
