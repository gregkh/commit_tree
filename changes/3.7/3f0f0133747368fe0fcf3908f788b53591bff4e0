aoe: use packets that work with the smallest-MTU local interface

Users with several network interfaces dedicated to AoE generally do not
configure them to support different-sized AoE data payloads on purpose.

For a given AoE target, there will be a set of local network interfaces
that can reach it.  Using only the payload that will fit in the
smallest-sized MTU of all those local interfaces greatly simplifies the
driver, especially in failure scenarios.
