drivers/misc/lis3lv02d: add generic DT matching code

Adds logic to parse lis3 properties from a device tree node and store them
in a freshly allocated lis3lv02d_platform_data.

Note that the actual match tables are left out here.  This part should
happen in the drivers that bind to the individual busses (SPI/I2C/PCI).

Also adds some DT bindinds documentation.
