arm64: Ignore memory blocks below PHYS_OFFSET

According to Documentation/arm64/booting.txt, the kernel image must be
loaded at a pre-defined offset from the start of RAM so that the kernel
can calculate PHYS_OFFSET based on this address. If the DT contains
memory blocks below this PHYS_OFFSET, report them and ignore the
corresponding memory range.
