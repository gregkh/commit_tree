PM / Domains: Operations related to cpuidle using domain names

Make it possible to use domain names in operations connecting cpuidle
to and disconnecting it from a PM domain.  This is useful on
platforms where PM domain objects are organized in such a way that
the names of the domains are easier to use than the addresses of
those objects.
