bas_gigaset: fix pre_reset handling

The delayed work function int_in_work() may call usb_reset_device()
and thus, indirectly, the driver's pre_reset method. Trying to
cancel the work synchronously in that situation would deadlock.
Fix by avoiding cancel_work_sync() in the pre_reset method.

If the reset was NOT initiated by int_in_work() this might cause
int_in_work() to run after the post_reset method, with urb_int_in
already resubmitted, so handle that case gracefully.
