Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _stServiceFlowParamSI and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _stServiceFlowParamSI,
changes the name of the struct to
bcm_connect_mgr_params, and updates the
comments appropriately. In addition, any
calls to typedefs "stServiceFlowParamSI,
*pstServiceFlowParamSI, and CServiceFlowParamSI"
are changed to call the struct directly.
