epoll: support for disabling items, and a self-test app

Enhanced epoll_ctl to support EPOLL_CTL_DISABLE, which disables an epoll
item.  If epoll_ctl doesn't return -EBUSY in this case, it is then safe to
delete the epoll item in a multi-threaded environment.  Also added a new
test_epoll self- test app to both demonstrate the need for this feature
and test it.
