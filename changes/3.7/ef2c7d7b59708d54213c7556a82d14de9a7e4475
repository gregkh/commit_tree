ipv6: fix handling of blackhole and prohibit routes

When adding a blackhole or a prohibit route, they were handling like classic
routes. Moreover, it was only possible to add this kind of routes by specifying
an interface.

Bug already reported here:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=498498

Before the patch:
  $ ip route add blackhole 2001::1/128
  RTNETLINK answers: No such device
  $ ip route add blackhole 2001::1/128 dev eth0
  $ ip -6 route | grep 2001
  2001::1 dev eth0  metric 1024

After:
  $ ip route add blackhole 2001::1/128
  $ ip -6 route | grep 2001
  blackhole 2001::1 dev lo  metric 1024  error -22

v2: wrong patch
v3: add a field fc_type in struct fib6_config to store RTN_* type
