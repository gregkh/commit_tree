serial: New serial driver MAX310X

This driver is a replacement for a MAX3107 driver with a lot of
improvements and new features.
The main differences from the old version:
- Using the regmap.
- Using devm_XXX-related functions.
- The use of threaded IRQ with IRQF_ONESHOT flag allows the driver to
  the hardware that supports only level IRQ.
- Improved error handling of serial port, improved FIFO handling,
  improved hardware & software flow control.
- Advanced flags allows turn on RS-485 mode (Auto direction control).
- Ability to load multiple instances of drivers.
- Added support for MAX3108.
- GPIO support.
- Driver is quite ready for adding I2C support and support other ICs
  with compatible registers set (MAX3109, MAX14830).
