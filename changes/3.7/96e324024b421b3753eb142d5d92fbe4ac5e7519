NFC: xmit from hci ops must return 0 or negative

xmit callback provided by a driver encapsulates upper layers
data and sends it to the hardware. So, HCI does not know the
exact amount of data being sent and thus can't handle partially
sent frames properly.

Therefore, the driver must return 0 for completely sent frame or
negative for failure.
