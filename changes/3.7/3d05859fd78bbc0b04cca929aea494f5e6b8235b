drm/exynos: make sure that hardware overlay for hdmi is disabled

the values set to registers will be updated into real registers
at vsync so dma operation could be malfunctioned when accessed
to memory after gem buffer was released. this patch makes sure
that hw overlay is disabled before the gem buffer is released.
