powerpc/eeh: Cleanup on EEH PCI address cache

The patch does cleanup on EEH PCI address cache based on the fact
EEH core is the only user of the component.

        * Cleanup on function names so that they all have prefix
          "eeh" and looks more short.
        * Function printk() has been replaced with pr_debug() or
          pr_warning() accordingly.
