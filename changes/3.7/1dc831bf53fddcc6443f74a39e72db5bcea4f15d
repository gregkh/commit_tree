ARM: Kirkwood: Update PCI-E fixup

- The code relies on rc_pci_fixup being called, which only happens
  when CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS is enabled, so add that to Kconfig. Omitting
  this causes a booting failure with a non-obvious cause.
- Update rc_pci_fixup to set the class properly, copying the
  more modern style from other places
- Correct the rc_pci_fixup comment
