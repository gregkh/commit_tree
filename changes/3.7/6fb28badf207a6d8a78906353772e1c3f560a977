PM / Domains: Rename the always_on device flag to syscore

The always_on device flag is used to mark the devices (belonging to
a PM domain) that should never be turned off, except for the system
core (syscore) suspend/hibernation and resume stages.  Change name
of that flag to "syscore" to better reflect its purpose.
