Btrfs: pass lockdep rwsem metadata to async commit transaction

The freeze rwsem is taken by sb_start_intwrite() and dropped during the
commit_ or end_transaction().  In the async case, that happens in a worker
thread.  Tell lockdep the calling thread is releasing ownership of the
rwsem and the async thread is picking it up.

XFS plays the same trick in fs/xfs/xfs_aops.c.
