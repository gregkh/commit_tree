regulator: add MAX8907 driver

The MAX8907 is an I2C-based power-management IC containing voltage
regulators, a reset controller, a real-time clock, and a touch-screen
controller.

The original driver was written by:
* Gyungoh Yoo <jack.yoo@maxim-ic.com>

Various fixes and enhancements by:
* Jin Park <jinyoungp@nvidia.com>
* Tom Cherry <tcherry@nvidia.com>
* Prashant Gaikwad <pgaikwad@nvidia.com>
* Dan Willemsen <dwillemsen@nvidia.com>
* Laxman Dewangan <ldewangan@nvidia.com>

During upstreaming, I (swarren):
* Converted to regmap.
* Allowed probing from device tree.
* Reworked the regulator driver to be represented as a single device that
  provides multiple regulators, rather than as a device per regulator.
* Replaced many regulator ops with standard functions.
* Added ability to specify supplies for each regulator.
* Removed the WLED regulator. If/when we expose this in the driver, it
  should be a backlight object not a regulator object.
* Renamed from max8907c->max8907, since the driver covers at least the
  C and B revisions.
* General cleanup.
