Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _stLocalSFAddIndication and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _stLocalSFAddIndication,
and changes the name of the struct to
bcm_add_indication. In addition, any
calls to typedefs "stLocalSFAddIndication,
*pstLocalSFAddIndication, stLocalSFChangeRequest,
*pstLocalSFChangeRequest, stLocalSFChangeIndication,
or *pstLocalSFChangeIndication " are changed to
call the struct directly.
