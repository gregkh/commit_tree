ARM: OMAP4: add _dev_attr_ to ocp2scp for representing usb_phy

In order to reflect devices(usb_phy) attached to ocp2scp bus, ocp2scp
is assigned a device attribute to represent the attached devices.

This is needed to fix MUSB regression caused by commit c9e4412a
(arm: omap: phy: remove unused functions from omap-phy-internal.c)
