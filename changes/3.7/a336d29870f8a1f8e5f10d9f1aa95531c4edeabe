nbd: handle discard requests

Add discard support to nbd.  If the nbd-server supports discard, it will
send NBD_FLAG_SEND_TRIM to the client.  The client will then set the flag
in the kernel via NBD_SET_FLAGS, which tells the kernel to enable discards
for the device (QUEUE_FLAG_DISCARD).

If discard support is enabled, then when the nbd client system receives a
discard request, this will be passed along to the nbd-server.  When the
discard request is received by the nbd-server, it will perform:

	fallocate(.. FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE ..)

To punch a hole in the backend storage, which is no longer needed.
