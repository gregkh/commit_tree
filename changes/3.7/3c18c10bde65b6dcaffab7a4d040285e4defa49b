tracing: Fix wakeup_rt self test on virtual machines

The warkeup_rt self test used msleep() calls to wait for real time
tasks to wake up and run. On bare-metal hardware, this was enough as
the scheduler should let the RT task run way before the non-RT task
wakes up from the msleep(). If it did not, then that would mean the
scheduler was broken.

But when dealing with virtual machines, this is a different story.
If the RT task wakes up on a VCPU, it's up to the host to decide when
that task gets to schedule, which can be far behind the time that the
non-RT task wakes up. In this case, the test would fail incorrectly.

As we are not testing the scheduler, but instead the wake up tracing,
we can use completions to wait and not depend on scheduler timings
to see if events happen on time.
