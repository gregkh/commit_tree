x86: Remove the useless branch in c_start()

Since 'cpu == -1' in cpumask_next() is legal, no need to handle
'*pos == 0' specially.

About the comments:

	/* just in case, cpu 0 is not the first */

A test with a cpumask in which cpu 0 is not the first has been
done, and it works well.

This patch will remove that useless branch to clean the code.
