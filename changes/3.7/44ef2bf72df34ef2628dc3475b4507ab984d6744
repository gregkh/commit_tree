[SCSI] isci: Fix interrupt coalescing assumption of active TCs

We always assign a dummy task context to a port in order to address a
silicon issue. We have 4 ports per controller. So when idle, there are always
exactly 4 TCs "active". The adaptive interrupt coalescing code uses number of
active TCs to figure out the coalescing values. However, we never hit "0" TCs
because of the 4 dummy TCs. Putting in fix so that we calculate this correctly.
