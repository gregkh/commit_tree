packet: Diag core and basic socket info dumping

The diag module can be built independently from the af_packet.ko one,
just like it's done in unix sockets.

The core dumping message carries the info available at socket creation
time, i.e. family, type and protocol (in the same byte order as shown in
the proc file).

The socket inode number and cookie is reserved for future per-socket info
retrieving. The per-protocol filtering is also reserved for future by
requiring the sdiag_protocol to be zero.
