PCI: Add weak pcibios_window_alignment() interface

This patch implements a weak function to return the default I/O or memory
window alignment for a P2P bridge.  By default, I/O windows are aligned to
4KiB or 1KiB and memory windows are aligned to 4MiB.  Some platforms, e.g.,
powernv, have special alignment requirements and can override
pcibios_window_alignment().
