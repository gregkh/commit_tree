procfs: Convert /proc/pid/fdinfo/ handling routines to seq-file v2

This patch converts /proc/pid/fdinfo/ handling routines to seq-file which
is needed to extend seq operations and plug in auxiliary fdinfo provides
from subsystems like eventfd/eventpoll/fsnotify.

Note the proc_fd_link no longer call for proc_fd_info, simply because
the guts of proc_fd_info() got merged into ->show() of that seq_file
