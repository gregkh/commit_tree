powerpc/pseries: Round up MSI-X requests

The pseries firmware currently refuses any non power of two MSI-X
request. Unfortunately most network drivers end up asking for that
because they want a power of two for RX queues and one or two extra
for everything else.

This patch rounds up the firmware request to the next power of two
if the quota allows it. If this fails we fall back to using the
original request size.
