xen-pciback: properly clean up after calling pcistub_device_find()

As the function calls pcistub_device_get() before returning non-NULL,
its callers need to take care of calling pcistub_device_put() on
(mostly, but not exclusively) error paths.

Otoh, the function already guarantees that the 'dev' member is non-NULL
upon successful return, so callers do not need to check for this a
second time.
