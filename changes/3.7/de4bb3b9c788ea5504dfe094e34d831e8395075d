samples/seccomp: fix endianness bug in LO_ARG define

The LO_ARG define needs to consider endianness also for 32 bit builds.

The "bpf_fancy" test case didn't work on s390 in 32 bit and compat mode
because the LO_ARG define resulted in a BPF program which read the upper
halve of the 64 bit system call arguments instead of the lower halves.
