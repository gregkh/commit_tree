audit: Use current instead of NETLINK_CREDS() in audit_filter

Get caller process uid and gid and pid values from the current task
instead of the NETLINK_CB.  This is simpler than passing NETLINK_CREDS
from from audit_receive_msg to audit_filter_user_rules and avoid the
chance of being hit by the occassional bugs in netlink uid/gid
credential passing.  This is a safe changes because all netlink
requests are processed in the task of the sending process.
