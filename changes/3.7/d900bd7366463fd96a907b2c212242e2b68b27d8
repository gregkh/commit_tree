powerpc/iommu: Fix multiple issues with IOMMU pools code

There are a number of issues in the recent IOMMU pools code:

- On a preempt kernel we might switch CPUs in the middle of building
  a scatter gather list. When this happens the handle hint passed in
  no longer falls within the local CPU's pool. Check for this and
  fall back to the pool hint.

- We were missing a spin_unlock/spin_lock in one spot where we
  switch pools.

- We need to provide locking around dart_tlb_invalidate_all and
  dart_tlb_invalidate_one now that the global lock is gone.
