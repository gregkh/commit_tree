Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _stCPacketClassificationRuleSI and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for
_stCPacketClassificationRuleSI, changes the
name of the struct to bcm_packet_class_rules,
and updates the comments appropriately . In
addition, any calls to typedefs
"CCPacketClassificationRuleSI,
stCPacketClassificationRuleSI,
or *pstCPacketClassificationRuleSI" are changed
to call the struct directly.
