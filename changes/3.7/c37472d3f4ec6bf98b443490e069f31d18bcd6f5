sata_highbank: mark ahci_highbank_probe as __devinit

The ahci_highbank_probe function is incorrectly marked as __init,
which means it can get discarded at boot time, which might be
a problem if for some reason the device only becomes operational
after loading another module.

Using __devinit instead avoids seeing this warning for every build:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.data+0xf7b0): Section mismatch in reference from the
variable ahci_highbank_driver to the function .init.text:ahci_highbank_probe()
The variable ahci_highbank_driver references
the function __init ahci_highbank_probe()
If the reference is valid then annotate the
variable with __init* or __refdata (see linux/init.h) or name the variable:
*_template, *_timer, *_sht, *_ops, *_probe, *_probe_one, *_console
