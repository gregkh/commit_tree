arm64: System calls handling

This patch adds support for system calls coming from 64-bit
applications. It uses the asm-generic/unistd.h definitions with the
canonical set of system calls. The private system calls are only used
for 32-bit (compat) applications as 64-bit ones can set the TLS and
flush the caches entirely from user space.

The sys_call_table is just an array defined in a C file and it contains
pointers to the syscall functions. The array is 4KB aligned to allow the
use of the ADRP instruction (longer range ADR) in entry.S.
