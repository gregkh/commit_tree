staging: comedi: daqboard2000: use attach_pci callback

Convert this PCI driver to use the comedi PCI auto config attach
mechanism by adding an 'attach_pci' callback function. Since the
driver does not require any external configuration options. and
the legacy 'attach' callback is now optional, remove it.
