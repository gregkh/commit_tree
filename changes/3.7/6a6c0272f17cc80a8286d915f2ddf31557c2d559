alpha: Fix preemption handling in idle loop

cpu_idle() is called on the boot CPU by the init code with
preemption disabled. But the cpu_idle() function in alpha
doesn't handle this when it calls schedule() directly.

Fix it by converting it into schedule_preempt_disabled().

Also disable preemption before calling cpu_idle() from
secondary CPU entry code to stay consistent with this
state.
