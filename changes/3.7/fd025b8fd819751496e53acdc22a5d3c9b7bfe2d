staging: drm/omap: remove reclaim_buffers callback

The reclaim_buffers callback has already been removed by Daniel Vetter
<daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch> with his patch "drm: kill reclaim_buffers callback"
(b0071efe82). As a result the kernel compilation fails with omapdrm support
and so the callback for reclaim_buffers is being removed from omapdrm.
