PM / Domains: Introduce simplified power on routine for system resume

Introduce function pm_genpd_sync_poweron() for restoring domain power
during resume from system suspend and hibernation.  It can be much
simpler than pm_genpd_poweron(), because it doesn't have to care
about locking and it can skip many checks done by the latter.

Modify pm_genpd_resume_noirq() and pm_genpd_restore_noirq() to use
the new function.
