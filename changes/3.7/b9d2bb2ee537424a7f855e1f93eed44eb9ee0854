Revert "SUNRPC: Ensure we close the socket on EPIPE errors too..."

This reverts commit 55420c24a0d4d1fce70ca713f84aa00b6b74a70e.
Now that we clear the connected flag when entering TCP_CLOSE_WAIT,
the deadlock described in this commit is no longer possible.
Instead, the resulting call to xs_tcp_shutdown() can interfere
with pending reconnection attempts.
