arm: mvebu: add basic address decoding support to Armada 370/XP

This commit adds basic support for address decoding configuration for
the Armada 370 and Armada XP SoCs, re-using the infrastructure
provided in plat-orion.

For now, only a BootROM window is configured on Armada XP, which is
needed to get the non-boot CPUs started and is therefore a requirement
for SMP support.
