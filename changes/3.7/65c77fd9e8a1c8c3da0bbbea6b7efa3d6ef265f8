blkcg: stop iteration early if root_rl is the only request list

__blk_queue_next_rl() finds next request list based on blkg_list
while skipping root_blkg in the list.
OTOH, root_rl is special as it may exist even without root_blkg.

Though the later part of the function handles such a case correctly,
exiting early is good for readability of the code.
