KVM: MMU: Optimize pte permission checks

walk_addr_generic() permission checks are a maze of branchy code, which is
performed four times per lookup.  It depends on the type of access, efer.nxe,
cr0.wp, cr4.smep, and in the near future, cr4.smap.

Optimize this away by precalculating all variants and storing them in a
bitmap.  The bitmap is recalculated when rarely-changing variables change
(cr0, cr4) and is indexed by the often-changing variables (page fault error
code, pte access permissions).

The permission check is moved to the end of the loop, otherwise an SMEP
fault could be reported as a false positive, when PDE.U=1 but PTE.U=0.

The result is short, branch-free code.
