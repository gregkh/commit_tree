percpu-rw-semaphores: use light/heavy barriers

This patch introduces new barrier pair light_mb() and heavy_mb() for
percpu rw semaphores.

This patch fixes a bug in percpu-rw-semaphores where a barrier was
missing in percpu_up_write.

This patch improves performance on the read path of
percpu-rw-semaphores: on non-x86 cpus, there was a smp_mb() in
percpu_up_read. This patch changes it to a compiler barrier and removes
the "#if defined(X86) ..." condition.
