Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _stLocalSFAddRequest and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _stLocalSFAddRequest,
and changes the name of the struct to
bcm_add_request. In addition, any
calls to typedefs "stLocalSFAddRequest or
*pstLocalSFAddRequest" are changed to
call the struct directly.
