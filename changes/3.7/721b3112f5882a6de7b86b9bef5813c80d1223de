perf hists browser: Fix output for 100.00%

Current hpp format functions assume that the output will fit to 6
character including % sign (XX.YY%) so used "%5.2f%%" as a format
string.  However it might be the case if collapsing resulted in a single
entry which has 100.00% (7 character) of period. In this case the output
will be shifted by 1 character.
