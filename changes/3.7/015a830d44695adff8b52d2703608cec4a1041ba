time/jiffies: bring back unconditional LATCH definition

Patch a7ea3bbf5d "time/jiffies: Allow CLOCK_TICK_RATE to be undefined"
breaks the compilation of targets that rely on the LATCH definition,
because of recursive header file inclusion not defining CLOCK_TICK_RATE
before it is checked here.

This fixes the problem by moving LATCH back to where it was, but it
seems that there are still cases where SHIFTED_HZ is defined incorrectly
because of the same problem. Need to investigate further.

Without this patch, building h7201_defconfig results in:

arch/arm/mach-h720x/common.c: In function 'h720x_gettimeoffset':
arch/arm/mach-h720x/common.c:50:73: error: 'LATCH' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/arm/mach-h720x/common.c:50:73: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
arch/arm/mach-h720x/common.c:51:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
