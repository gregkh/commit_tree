netfilter: xt_TEE: don't use destination address found in header

Torsten Luettgert bisected TEE regression starting with commit
f8126f1d5136be1 (ipv4: Adjust semantics of rt->rt_gateway.)

The problem is that it tries to ARP-lookup the original destination
address of the forwarded packet, not the address of the gateway.

Fix this using FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH Julian added in commit
c92b96553a80c1 (ipv4: Add FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH), so that known
nexthop (info->gw.ip) has preference on resolving.
