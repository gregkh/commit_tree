USB: chipidea: add imx usbmisc support

i.MX usb controllers share non-core registers, which may include
SoC specific controls. We turn it into a usbmisc device and usbmisc
driver set operations needed by ci13xxx_imx driver.

For example, Sabrelite board has bad over-current design, we can
usbmisc to disable over-current detection.
