xen-pciback: support wild cards in slot specifications

Particularly for hiding sets of SR-IOV devices, specifying them all
individually is rather cumbersome. Therefore, allow function and slot
numbers to be replaced by a wildcard character ('*').

Unfortunately this gets complicated by the in-kernel sscanf()
implementation not being really standard conformant - matching of
plain text tails cannot be checked by the caller (a patch to overcome
this will be sent shortly, and a follow-up patch for simplifying the
code is planned to be sent when that fixed went upstream).
