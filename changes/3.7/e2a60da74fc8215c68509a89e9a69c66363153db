block: Clean up special command handling logic

Remove special-casing of non-rw fs style requests (discard). The nomerge
flags are consolidated in blk_types.h, and rq_mergeable() and
bio_mergeable() have been modified to use them.

bio_is_rw() is used in place of bio_has_data() a few places. This is
done to to distinguish true reads and writes from other fs type requests
that carry a payload (e.g. write same).
