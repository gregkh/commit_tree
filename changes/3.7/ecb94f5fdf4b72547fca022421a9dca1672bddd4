ext4: collapse a single extent tree block into the inode if possible

If an inode has more than 4 extents, but then later some of the
extents are merged together, we can optimize the file system by moving
the extents up into the inode, and discarding the extent tree block.
This is important, because if there are a large number of inodes with
an external extent tree blocks where the contents could fit in the
inode, this can significantly increase the fsck time of the file
system.
