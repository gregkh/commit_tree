direct-io: don't read inode->i_blkbits multiple times

Since directio can work on a raw block device, and the block size of the
device can change under it, we need to do the same thing that
fs/buffer.c now does: read the block size a single time, using
ACCESS_ONCE().

Reading it multiple times can get different results, which will then
confuse the code because it actually encodes the i_blksize in
relationship to the underlying logical blocksize.
