xHCI: add aborting command ring function

Software have to abort command ring and cancel command
when a command is failed or hang. Otherwise, the command
ring will hang up and can't handle the others. An example
of a command that may hang is the Address Device Command,
because waiting for a SET_ADDRESS request to be acknowledged
by a USB device is outside of the xHC's ability to control.

To cancel a command, software will initialize a command
descriptor for the cancel command, and add it into a
cancel_cmd_list of xhci.

Sarah: Fixed missing newline on "Have the command ring been stopped?"
debugging statement.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contain
the commit 7ed603ecf8b68ab81f4c83097d3063d43ec73bb8 "xhci: Add an
assertion to check for virt_dev=0 bug." That commit papers over a NULL
pointer dereference, and this patch fixes the underlying issue that
caused the NULL pointer dereference.
