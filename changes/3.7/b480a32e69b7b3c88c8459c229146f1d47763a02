[SCSI] bfa: Fix few attributes in the RHBA CT passthru command

- Made changes to set the RHBA command max payload based on
  the port configured frame size.
- Made changes to fix the driver/fw version size in FMDI structure.
- Fix to pass the fw version for FDMI attribute type
  FDMI_HBA_ATTRIB_FW_VERSION rather than driver version.
