ARM: OMAP4460/4470: PMU: Enable PMU for OMAP4460/70

OMAP4460 and OMAP4470 devices have dedicated PMU interrupts and so add these
interrupts to the MPU HWMOD so we can use these for PMU events on these
devices. The PMU interrupts need to be the first interrupts in the array of
interrupts as the ARM PMU driver assumes this.

By using these dedicated interrupts we only need to enable the MPU and DEBUG
sub-systems for PMU to work. This is different to OMAP4430 that did not have
dedicated interrupts and required other power domains in addition to the DEBUG
sub-system to be enabled so we could route the PMU events to the CTI interrupts.
Hence, OMAP4460 and OMAP4470 devices can use the same list of HWMODs to create
the PMU device that is using by OMAP3.
