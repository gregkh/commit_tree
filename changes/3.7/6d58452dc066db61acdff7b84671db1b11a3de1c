rbtree: adjust root color in rb_insert_color() only when necessary

The root node of an rbtree must always be black.  However,
rb_insert_color() only needs to maintain this invariant when it has been
broken - that is, when it exits the loop due to the current (red) node
being the root.  In all other cases (exiting after tree rotations, or
exiting due to an existing black parent) the invariant is already
satisfied, so there is no need to adjust the root node color.
