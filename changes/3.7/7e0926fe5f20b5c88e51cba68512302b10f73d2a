Btrfs: fix use of radix_tree for name_cache in send/receive

We can't easily use the index of the radix tree for inums as the
radix tree uses 32bit indexes on 32bit kernels. For 32bit kernels,
we now use the lower 32bit of the inum as index and an additional
list to store multiple entries per radix tree entry.
