x86/smp: Don't ever patch back to UP if we unplug cpus

We still patch SMP instructions to UP variants if we boot with a
single CPU, but not at any other time.  In particular, not if we
unplug CPUs to return to a single cpu.

Paul McKenney points out:

 mean offline overhead is 6251/48=130.2 milliseconds.

 If I remove the alternatives_smp_switch() from the offline
 path [...] the mean offline overhead is 550/42=13.1 milliseconds

Basically, we're never going to get those 120ms back, and the
code is pretty messy.

We get rid of:

 1) The "smp-alt-once" boot option. It's actually "smp-alt-boot", the
    documentation is wrong. It's now the default.

 2) The skip_smp_alternatives flag used by suspend.

 3) arch_disable_nonboot_cpus_begin() and arch_disable_nonboot_cpus_end()
    which were only used to set this one flag.
