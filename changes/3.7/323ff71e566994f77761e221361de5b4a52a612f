be2net: cleanup code related to be_link_status_query()

1) link_status_query() is always called to query the link-speed (speed
after applying qos). When there is no qos setting, link-speed is derived from
port-speed. Do all this inside this routine and hide this from the callers.

2) adpater->phy.forced_port_speed is not being set anywhere after being
initialized. Get rid of this variable.

3) Ignore async link_speed notifications till the initial value has been
fetched from FW.
