gpio: introduce gpio-mvebu driver for Marvell SoCs

This driver aims at replacing the arch/arm/plat-orion/gpio.c driver,
and is designed to be compatible with all Marvell EBU SoCs: Orion,
Kirkwood, Dove, Armada 370/XP and Discovery.

It has been successfully tested on Dove and Armada XP at the moment.

Compared to the plat-orion driver, this new driver has the following
added benefits:

 *) Support for Armada 370 and Armada XP
 *) It is integrated with the mvebu pinctrl driver so that GPIO pins
    are properly muxed, and the GPIO driver knows which GPIO pins are
    output-only or input-only.
 *) Properly placed in drivers/gpio
 *) More extensible mechanism to support platform differences. The
    plat-orion driver uses a simple mask-offset DT property, which
    works fine for Discovery MV78200 but not for Armada XP. The new
    driver uses different compatible strings to identify the different
    variants of the GPIO controllers.
