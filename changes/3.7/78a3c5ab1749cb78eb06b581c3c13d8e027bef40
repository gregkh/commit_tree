mfd: twl-core: Fix chip ID for the twl6030-pwm module

The correct chip id is 1 since the PWM module is on address 0x49. With the
current TWL6030_MODULE_ID1 the kernel will crash early since we have:

 #define TWL6030_MODULE_ID1 0x0E
and
 static struct twl_client twl_modules[4];

Down in the stack we try to get the module by:
struct twl_client	*twl = &twl_modules[chip];

Which is obviously going to do nasty things.
