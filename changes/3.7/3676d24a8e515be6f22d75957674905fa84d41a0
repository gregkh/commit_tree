microblaze: clinkage.h

Nothing includes <asm/clinkage.h>. It has actually never been included
since it was added to the tree in commit
9981cd94d526a300dbef58048b1d281386b7289c ("microblaze_v8: clinkage.h
linkage.h sections.h kmap_types.h"). That's not surprising, since
including it is indistinguishable from including <linux/linkage.h>. It
can safely be removed.
