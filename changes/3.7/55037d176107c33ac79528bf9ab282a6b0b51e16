powerpc/eeh: Create PEs for PHBs

For one particular PE, it's only meaningful in the ancestor PHB
domain. Therefore, each PHB should have its own PE hierarchy tree
to trace those PEs created against the PHB.

The patch creates PEs for the PHBs and put those PEs into the
global link list traced by "eeh_phb_pe". The link list of PEs
would be first level of overall PE hierarchy tree across the
system.
