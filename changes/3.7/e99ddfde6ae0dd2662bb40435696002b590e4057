ALSA: ua101, usx2y: fix broken MIDI output

Commit 88a8516a2128 (ALSA: usbaudio: implement USB autosuspend) added
autosuspend code to all files making up the snd-usb-audio driver.
However, midi.c is part of snd-usb-lib and is also used by other
drivers, not all of which support autosuspend.  Thus, calls to
usb_autopm_get_interface() could fail, and this unexpected error would
result in the MIDI output being completely unusable.

Make it work by ignoring the error that is expected with drivers that do
not support autosuspend.
