PCI/ACPI: Use DEVICE_ACPI_HANDLE rather than searching acpi_pci_roots

When we bind a device to an ACPI handle, the handle is stored in
dev->archdata.acpi_handle.  For such devices, there's no need to
search the acpi_pci_roots list with acpi_get_pci_rootbridge_handle();
we can just use DEVICE_ACPI_HANDLE(dev) directly.
