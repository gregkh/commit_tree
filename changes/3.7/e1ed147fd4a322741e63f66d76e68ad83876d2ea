mtd: spear_smi: use devm_ functions consistently

Use devm_kzalloc for all calls to kzalloc and not just the first.  Use devm
functions for other allocations as well.

Move the call to platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_MEM, 0) closer to
where its result is passed to devm_request_and_ioremap to make the lack of
need for a NULL test more evident.

The semantic match that finds the inconsistency is as follows:
