drm/i915: paper over a pipe-enable vs pageflip race

I've discovered this on my ivb machine while stress-testing the new
flip_tests. Only harmful effect observed is that the timestamp is a
bit bogus.

Note that this is empirical duct-tape: I've noticed that we seem to
only ever miss the very first vblank irq right after enabling the
pipe. And with this hack applied I couldn't reproduce the failure case
anywhere else any more.
