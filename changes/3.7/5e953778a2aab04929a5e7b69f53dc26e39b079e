ipconfig: add nameserver IPs to kernel-parameter ip=

On small systems (e.g. embedded ones) IP addresses are often configured
by bootloaders and get assigned to kernel via parameter "ip=".  If set to
"ip=dhcp", even nameserver entries from DHCP daemons are handled. These
entries exported in /proc/net/pnp are commonly linked by /etc/resolv.conf.

To configure nameservers for networks without DHCP, this patch adds option
<dns0-ip> and <dns1-ip> to kernel-parameter 'ip='.
