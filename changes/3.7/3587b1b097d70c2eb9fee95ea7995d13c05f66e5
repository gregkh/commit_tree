fanotify: fix FAN_Q_OVERFLOW case of fanotify_read()

If the FAN_Q_OVERFLOW bit set in event->mask, the fanotify event
metadata will not contain a valid file descriptor, but
copy_event_to_user() didn't check for that, and unconditionally does a
fd_install() on the file descriptor.

Which in turn will cause a BUG_ON() in __fd_install().

Introduced by commit 352e3b249284 ("fanotify: sanitize failure exits in
copy_event_to_user()")

Mea culpa - missed that path ;-/
