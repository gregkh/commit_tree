NFSv4.1: Get rid of pNFS layout state "NFS_LAYOUT_INVALID"

In all cases where we set NFS_LAYOUT_INVALID, we also set NFS_LAYOUT_DESTROYED.
Furthermore, in all cases where we test for NFS_LAYOUT_INVALID, we should
also be testing for NFS_LAYOUT_DESTROYED, since the latter means that
we hold no valid layout segments.
Ergo the two are redundant.
