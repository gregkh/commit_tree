USB: Enable LPM after a failed probe.

Before a driver is probed, we want to disable USB 3.0 Link Power
Management (LPM), in case the driver needs hub-initiated LPM disabled.
After the probe finishes, we want to attempt to re-enable LPM, order to
balance the LPM ref count.

When a probe fails (such as when libusual doesn't want to bind to a USB
3.0 mass storage device), make sure to balance the LPM ref counts by
re-enabling LPM.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.5, that contain
the commit 8306095fd2c1100e8244c09bf560f97aca5a311d "USB: Disable USB
3.0 LPM in critical sections."
