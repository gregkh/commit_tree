sparc64: Improvde documentation and readability of atomic backoff code.

Document what's going on in asm/backoff.h with a large and descriptive
comment.  Refer to it above the cpu_relax() definition in
asm/processor_64.h

Rename the pause patching section to have "3insn" in it's name like
the other patching sections do.

Based upon feedback from Sam Ravnborg.
