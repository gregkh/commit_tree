uprobes: Introduce MMF_HAS_UPROBES

Add the new MMF_HAS_UPROBES flag. It is set by install_breakpoint()
and it is copied by dup_mmap(), uprobe_pre_sstep_notifier() checks
it to avoid the slow path if the task was never probed. Perhaps it
makes sense to check it in valid_vma(is_register => false) as well.

This needs the new dup_mmap()->uprobe_dup_mmap() hook. We can't use
uprobe_reset_state() or put MMF_HAS_UPROBES into MMF_INIT_MASK, we
need oldmm->mmap_sem to avoid the race with uprobe_register() or
mmap() from another thread.

Currently we never clear this bit, it can be false-positive after
uprobe_unregister() or uprobe_munmap() or if dup_mmap() hits the
probed VM_DONTCOPY vma. But this is fine correctness-wise and has
no effect unless the task hits the non-uprobe breakpoint.
