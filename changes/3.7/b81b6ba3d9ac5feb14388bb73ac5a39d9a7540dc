Thermal: rename structure thermal_cooling_device_instance to thermal_instance

This struct is used to describe the behavior for a thermal
cooling device on a certain trip point for a certain thremal zone.

thermal_cooling_device_instance is not accurate, as a cooling device
can be used for more than one trip point in one thermal zone device.
