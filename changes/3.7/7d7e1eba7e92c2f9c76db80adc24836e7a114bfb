ARM: OMAP2+: Prepare for irqs.h removal

As the interrupts should only be defined in the platform_data, and
eventually coming from device tree, there's no need to define them
in header files.

Let's remove the hardcoded references to irqs.h and fix up the includes
so we don't rely on headers included in irqs.h. Note that we're
defining OMAP_INTC_START as 0 to the interrupts. This will be needed
when we enable SPARSE_IRQ. For some drivers we need to add
#include <plat/cpu.h> for now until these drivers are fixed to
remove cpu_is_omapxxxx() usage.

While at it, sort som of the includes the standard way, and add
the trailing commas where they are missing in the related data
structures.

Note that for drivers/staging/tidspbridge we just define things
locally.
