NFS: add nfs_sb_deactive_async to avoid deadlock

Use nfs_sb_deactive_async instead of nfs_sb_deactive when in a workqueue
context.  This avoids a deadlock where rpc_shutdown_client loops forever
in a workqueue kworker context, trying to kill all RPC tasks associated with
the client, while one or more of these tasks have already been assigned to the
same kworker (and will never run rpc_exit_task).

This approach is needed because RPC tasks that have already been assigned
to a kworker by queue_work cannot be canceled, as explained in the comment
for workqueue.c:insert_wq_barrier.
