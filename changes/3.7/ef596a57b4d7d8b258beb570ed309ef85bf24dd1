ALSA: hda - Add support for MacBook Pro 10,1

MacBook Pro 10,1 needs a few adjustments to make it working:
- more COEF verbs
- some pin config overrides to disable the unused pin (0x0d, 0x12),
  and fix the internal mic (0x0e)

In addition, it uses GPIO 1 and 3 like other MacBooks.

The internal digital mic on the machine is still problematic: it seems
that only the right channel is used and the left is always static.
This looks like a hardware design, so we need to cope in the software
side somehow...

The primary information and test were brought from Daniel J Blueman.
