ARM: perf: move irq registration into pmu implementation

This patch moves the CPU-specific IRQ registration and parsing code into
the CPU PMU backend. This is required because a PMU may have more than
one interrupt, which in turn can be either PPI (per-cpu) or SPI
(requiring strict affinity setting at the interrupt distributor).
