mac80211: validate skb->dev in the tx status path

skb->dev might contain a stale reference to a device that was already
deleted, and using it unchecked can lead to invalid pointer accesses.
Since this is only used for nl80211 tx, iterate over active interfaces
to find a match for skb->dev, and discard the tx status if the device
is gone.
