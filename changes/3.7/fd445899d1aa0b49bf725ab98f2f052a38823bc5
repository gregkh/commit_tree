staging: comedi: addi_amcc_S5920.[ch]: remove unnecessary files

The addi_amcc_S5920.c file only has the function i_AddiHeaderRW_ReadEeprom()
in it. The addi_amcc_S5920.h file has a prototype for this function and a
couple defines for the magic numbers used when accessing the eeprom.

The .c file is not actually built by any .config selection, or by an

The .h file is only #include'd by the hwdrv_apci3200.c file. That file
actually has a local version of the i_AddiHeaderRW_ReadEeprom() function
that is identical to the one in the .c file.

Just move the #define's from the .h file into hwdrv_apci3200.c and remove
the addi_amcc_S5920.[ch] files.
