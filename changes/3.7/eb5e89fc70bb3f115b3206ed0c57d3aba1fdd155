virtio/console: Add splice_write support

Enable to use splice_write from pipe to virtio-console port.
This steals pages from pipe and directly send it to host.

Note that this may accelerate only the guest to host path.

Changes in v2:
 - Use GFP_KERNEL instead of GFP_ATOMIC in syscall context function.
