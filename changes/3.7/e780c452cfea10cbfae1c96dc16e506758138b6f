ARM: 7494/1: use generic termios.h

As pointed out by Arnd Bergmann, this fixes a couple of issues but will
increase code size:

The original macro user_termio_to_kernel_termios was not endian safe. It
used an unsigned short ptr to access the low bits in a 32-bit word.

Both user_termio_to_kernel_termios and kernel_termios_to_user_termio are
missing error checking on put_user/get_user and copy_to/from_user.
