ASoC: kirkwood-dma: fix use of virt_to_phys()

This is part of a patch found in Rabeeh Khoury's git tree for the
cubox.

You can not use virt_to_phys() on the address returned from
dma_alloc_coherent(); it may not be part of the kernel direct-mapped
memory.  Fix this to use the DMA address instead.
