batman-adv: Fix broadcast packet CRC calculation

So far the crc16 checksum for a batman-adv broadcast data packet, received
on a batman-adv hard interface, was calculated over zero bytes of its
content leading to many incoming broadcast data packets wrongly being
dropped (60-80% packet loss).

This patch fixes this issue by calculating the crc16 over the actual,
complete broadcast payload.

The issue is a regression introduced by
("batman-adv: add broadcast duplicate check").
