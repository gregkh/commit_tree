drm/i915: Segregate memory domains in the GTT using coloring

Several functions of the GPU have the restriction that differing memory
domains cannot be placed next to each other (as the GPU may prefetch
beyond the end of one domain and hang as it crosses into the other
domain). We use the facility of the drm_mm to mark ranges with a
particular color that corresponds to the cache attributes of those pages
in order to prevent allocating adjacent blocks of differing memory
types.

v2: Rebase ontop of drm_mm coloring v2.
v3: Fix rebinding existing gtt_space and add a verification routine.
