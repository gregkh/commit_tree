arch/tile: avoid generating .eh_frame information in modules

The tile tool chain uses the .eh_frame information for backtracing.
The vmlinux build drops any .eh_frame sections at link time, but when
present in kernel modules, it causes a module load failure due to the
presence of unsupported pc-relative relocations.  When compiling to
use compiler feedback support, the compiler by default omits .eh_frame
information, so we don't see this problem.  But when not using feedback,
we need to explicitly suppress the .eh_frame.
