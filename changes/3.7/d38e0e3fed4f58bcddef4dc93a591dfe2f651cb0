Revert "Staging: Android alarm: IOCTL command encoding fix"

Commit 6bd4a5d96c08dc2380f8053b1bd4f879f55cd3c9 changed the
ANDROID_ALARM_GET_TIME ioctls from IOW to IOR.  While technically
correct, the _IOC_DIR bits are ignored by alarm_ioctl, so the
commit breaks a userspace ABI used by all existing Android devices
for a purely cosmetic reason.  Revert it.
