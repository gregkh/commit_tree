staging:iio: Fix adis16209 channel offsets and scales

Most of the channel offsets and scales in the adis16209 are incorrect:
	* Temperature scale is of by a factor of 1000
	* Voltage scale is of by a factor of 1000
	* Temperature offset is completely wrong
	* Rotational position scale is missing

This patch fixes these issues. Also use the IIO_G_TO_M_S_2 macro for the
acceleration scale since this makes it much easier to compare it with the value
given in the datasheet.
