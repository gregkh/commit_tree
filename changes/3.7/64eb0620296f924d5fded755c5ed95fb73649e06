KVM: correctly detect APIC SW state in kvm_apic_post_state_restore()

For apic_set_spiv() to track APIC SW state correctly it needs to see
previous and next values of the spurious vector register, but currently
memset() overwrite the old value before apic_set_spiv() get a chance to
do tracking. Fix it by calling apic_set_spiv() before overwriting old
value.
