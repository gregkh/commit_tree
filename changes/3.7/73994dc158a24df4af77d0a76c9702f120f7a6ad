perf script: Replace "struct thread" with "struct addr_location" as a parameter for "process_event()"

Both perl and python script start processing events other than trace
points, and it's useful to pass the resolved symbol and the dso info to
the event handler in script for better analysis and statistics.

Struct thread is already a member of struct addr_location, using
addr_location will keep the thread info, while providing additional
symbol and dso info if exist, so that the script itself doesn't need to
bother to do the symbol resolving and dso searching work.
