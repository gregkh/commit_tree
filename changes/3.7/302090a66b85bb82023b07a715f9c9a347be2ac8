ARM: at91/i2c: change id to let i2c-at91 work

The i2c core driver will turn the platform device ID to busnum
When using platfrom device ID as -1, it means dynamically assigned
the busnum. When writing code, we need to make sure the busnum,
and call i2c_register_board_info(int busnum, ...) to register device
if using -1, we do not know the value of busnum

In order to solve this issue, set the platform device ID as a fix number
Here using 0 to match the busnum used in i2c_regsiter_board_info()
