brcmfmac: add e-scan support.

This patch adds e-scan support (currently i-scan is in use). E-scan
is a more powerful and memory efficient method for scanning. E-scan
will be the default scan method and eventually, i-scan support will
be removed. The scan methods do not make any difference to the end-user.
