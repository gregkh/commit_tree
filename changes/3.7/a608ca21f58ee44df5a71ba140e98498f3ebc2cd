vfs: allocate page instead of names_cache buffer in mount_block_root

First, it's incorrect to call putname() after __getname_gfp() since the
bare __getname_gfp() call skips the auditing code, while putname()
doesn't.

mount_block_root allocates a PATH_MAX buffer via __getname_gfp, and then
calls get_fs_names to fill the buffer. That function can call
get_filesystem_list which assumes that that buffer is a full page in
size. On arches where PAGE_SIZE != 4k, then this could potentially
overrun.

In practice, it's hard to imagine the list of filesystem names even
approaching 4k, but it's best to be safe. Just allocate a page for this
purpose instead.

With this, we can also remove the __getname_gfp() definition since there
are no more callers.
