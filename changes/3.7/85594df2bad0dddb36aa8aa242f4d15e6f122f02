ARM: dtb: move all dtb targets to common Makefile

Since the dtb targets have moved to arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile, sweep
the platforms that have had new targets added recently and move them over.

While I was at it, I also made the dtb generation more generic, i.e. if
the platform is enabled then all dtbs for that platform will be created.
