MTD: pxa3xx-nand: add devicetree bindings

This patch contains a hack to get the DMA resources of the device when
probed from a devicetree node. This can be removed once a generic DMA
controller framework lands.

A mtd_part_parser_data is passed mtd_device_parse_register which
contains a reference to the device node, so MTD partitions can be
added as children.
