staging:iio: Fix adis16201 channel offsets and scales

Most of the channel offsets and scales in the adis16201 are incorrect:
	* Temperature scale is off by a factor of 1000
	* Voltage scale is off by a factor of 1000
	* Acceleration scale is in g instead of m/(s**2)
	* Temperature offset is completely wrong

This patch fixes these issues.
