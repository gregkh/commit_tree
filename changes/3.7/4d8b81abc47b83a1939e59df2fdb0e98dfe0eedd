KVM: introduce readonly memslot

In current code, if we map a readonly memory space from host to guest
and the page is not currently mapped in the host, we will get a fault
pfn and async is not allowed, then the vm will crash

We introduce readonly memory region to map ROM/ROMD to the guest, read access
is happy for readonly memslot, write access on readonly memslot will cause
KVM_EXIT_MMIO exit
