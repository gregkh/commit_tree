usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix dwc3_stop_active_transfer for synchronization delay

dwc3_stop_active_transfer has been called from two places. After each
calling of this function , we should allow 100 us delay to synchronize
with interconnect.

It would be better if we put this delay in that function only, rather
than into calling routine of this function.
