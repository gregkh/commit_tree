usb: gadget: remove global variable composite in composite.c

This patch removes the global variable composite in composite.c.
The private data which was saved there is now passed via an additional
argument to the bind() function in struct usb_gadget_driver.

Only the "old-style" UDC drivers have to be touched here, new style are
doing it right because this change is made in udc-core.
