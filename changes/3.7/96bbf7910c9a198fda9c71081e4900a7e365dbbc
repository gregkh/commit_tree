ARM: ux500: Pass PMU platform data due for Perf though AUXDATA

When booting with Device Tree we need a way to call-back to the
DB8500 PMU IRQ handler. This is necessary because the two CPU
IRQ lines are muxed together on the DB8500 chip. The DB8500
PMU IRQ handler contains logic to pass over to the other core
in the case of IRQ_NONE. This patch allows the DB8500 PMU IRQ
handler to be passed to Perf through platform data.
