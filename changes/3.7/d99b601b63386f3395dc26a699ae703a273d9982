[SCSI] zfcp: restore refcount check on port_remove

Upstream commit f3450c7b917201bb49d67032e9f60d5125675d6a
"[SCSI] zfcp: Replace local reference counting with common kref"
accidentally dropped a reference count check before tearing down
zfcp_ports that are potentially in use by zfcp_units.
Even remote ports in use can be removed causing
unreachable garbage objects zfcp_ports with zfcp_units.
Thus units won't come back even after a manual port_rescan.
The kref of zfcp_port->dev.kobj is already used by the driver core.
We cannot re-use it to track the number of zfcp_units.
Re-introduce our own counter for units per port
and check on port_remove.
