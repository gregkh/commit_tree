cifs: change cifs_call_async to use smb_rqst structs

For now, none of the callers populate rq_pages. That will be done for
writes in a later patch. While we're at it, change the prototype of
setup_async_request not to need a return pointer argument. Just
return the pointer to the mid_q_entry or an ERR_PTR.
