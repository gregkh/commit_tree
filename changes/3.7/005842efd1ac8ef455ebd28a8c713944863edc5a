rapidio: run discovery as an asynchronous process

Modify mport initialization routine to run the RapidIO discovery process
asynchronously.  This allows to have an arbitrary order of enumerating and
discovering ports in systems with multiple RapidIO controllers without
creating a deadlock situation if enumerator port is registered after a
discovering one.

Making netID matching to mportID ensures consistent net ID assignment in
multiport RapidIO systems with asynchronous discovery process (global
counter implementation is affected by race between threads).
