wlcore: Allow memory access when the FW crashes

When the no_recovery flag is used, the recovery work will not restart
the FW and the state will not be set to 'on'. To enable post-mortem
analysis, allow memory access in the 'restarting' state.

Also, since the FW might not be operational, don't fail the read/write
operations if elp_wakeup fails.
