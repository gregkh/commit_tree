virtio: add help to CONFIG_VIRTIO option.

Trying to enable a virtio driver (eg CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK) is painful
because it depends on CONFIG_VIRTIO.  CONFIG_VIRTIO doesn't tell you
how to turn it on (it's selected from anything which provides a virtio
bus).

This patch at least adds some documentation, visible in menuconfig, as
a hint.
