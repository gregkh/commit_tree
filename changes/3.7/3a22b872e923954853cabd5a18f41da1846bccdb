usb: Fail a get config when the port is powered off.

Alan Stern pointed out that a USB port could potentially get powered off
when the attached USB device is in the middle of enumerating, due to
race conditions:

If that happens, we need to ensure the enumeration fails.  If a call to
usb_get_descriptor() fails for a reason other than a Stall, return an
error.  That should handle the case where the port is powered off.
