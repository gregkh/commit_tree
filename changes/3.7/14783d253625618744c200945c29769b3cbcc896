[media] s5p-fimc: Add support for V4L2_PIX_FMT_S5C_UYVY_JPG fourcc

The V4L2_PIX_FMT_S5C_YUYV_JPG image formats consists of 2 planes, the
first containing interleaved JPEG/YUYV data and the second containing
meta data describing the interleaving method.
The image data is transferred with MIPI-CSI "User Defined Byte-Based
Data 1" type and is captured to memory by FIMC DMA engine.
The meta data is transferred using MIPI-CSI2 "Embedded 8-bit non Image
Data" and it is captured in the MIPI-CSI slave device and copied to
the bridge provided buffer.
To make sure the size of allocated buffers is correct for the subdevs
configuration when VIDIOC_STREAMON ioctl is invoked, an additional
check is added at the video pipeline validation function.
Flag FMT_FLAGS_COMPRESSED indicates the buffer size must be retrieved
from a sensor subdev.
