ALSA: snd-usb: Add quirks for Playback Designs devices

Playback Designs' USB devices have some hardware limitations on their
USB interface. In particular:

 - They need a 20ms delay after each class compliant request as the
   hardware ACKs the USB packets before the device is actually ready
   for the next command. Sending data immediately will result in buffer
   overflows in the hardware.
 - The devices send bogus feedback data at the start of each stream
   which confuse the feedback format auto-detection.

This patch introduces a new quirks hook that is called after each
control packet and which adds a delay for all devices that match
Playback Designs' USB VID for now.

In addition, it adds a counter to snd_usb_endpoint to drop received
packets on the floor. Another new quirks function that is called once
an endpoint is started initializes that counter for these devices on
their sync endpoint.
