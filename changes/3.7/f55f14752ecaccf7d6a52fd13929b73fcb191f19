ASoC: mxs-saif: Fix channel swap for 24-bit format

Playing 24-bit format file leads to channel swap on mx28 and the reason is that
the current driver performs one write/read to/from the SAIF_DATA register to
trigger the transfer.

This approach works fine for S16_LE case because SAIF_DATA is a 32-bit register
and thus is capable of storing the 16-bit left and right channels, but for the
S24_LE case it can only store one channel, so in order to not lose the FIFO sync
an extra read/write is needed.
