usb : Add sysfs files to control port power.

This patch adds two sysfs files for each usb hub port to allow userspace
to control the port power policy.

For an upcoming Intel xHCI roothub, this will translate into ACPI calls
to completely power off or power on the port.  As a reminder, when these
ports are completely powered off, the USB host and device will see a
physical disconnect.  All future USB device connections will be lost,
and the device will not be able to signal a remote wakeup.

The control sysfs file can be written to with two options:
"on" - port power must be on.
"off" - port must be off.

The state sysfs file reports usb port's power state:
"on" - powered on
"off" - powered off
"error" - can't get power state

For now, let userspace dictate the port power off policy.  Future
patches may add an in-kernel policy.
