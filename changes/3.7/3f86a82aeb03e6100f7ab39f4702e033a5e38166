block: Consolidate bio_alloc_bioset(), bio_kmalloc()

Previously, bio_kmalloc() and bio_alloc_bioset() behaved slightly
different because there was some almost-duplicated code - this fixes
some of that.

The important change is that previously bio_kmalloc() always set
bi_io_vec = bi_inline_vecs, even if nr_iovecs == 0 - unlike
bio_alloc_bioset(). This would cause bio_has_data() to return true; I
don't know if this resulted in any actual bugs but it was certainly
wrong.

bio_kmalloc() and bio_alloc_bioset() also have different arbitrary
limits on nr_iovecs - 1024 (UIO_MAXIOV) for bio_kmalloc(), 256
(BIO_MAX_PAGES) for bio_alloc_bioset(). This patch doesn't fix that, but
at least they're enforced closer together and hopefully they will be
fixed in a later patch.

This'll also help with some future cleanups - there are a fair number of
functions that allocate bios (e.g. bio_clone()), and now they don't have
to be duplicated for bio_alloc(), bio_alloc_bioset(), and bio_kmalloc().
