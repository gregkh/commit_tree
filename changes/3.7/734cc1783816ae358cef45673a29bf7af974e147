TTY: use tty_port_register_device

Currently we have no way to assign tty->port while performing tty
installation. There are two ways to provide the link tty_struct =>
tty_port. Either by calling tty_port_install from tty->ops->install or
tty_port_register_device called instead of tty_register_device when
the device is being set up after connected.

In this patch we modify most of the drivers to do the latter. When the
drivers use tty_register_device and we have tty_port already, we
switch to tty_port_register_device. So we have the tty_struct =>
tty_port link for free for those.
