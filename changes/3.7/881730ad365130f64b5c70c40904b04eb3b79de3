s390/cache: expose cpu cache topology via sysfs

Expose cpu cache topology via sysfs.
The created sysfs directory structure is compatible to what x86, ia64
and powerpc have.
On s390 we expose only information about cpu caches which are private
to a cpu via sysfs . Caches which are shared between cpus do not have
a sysfs representation.
The reason for that is that the file "shared_cpu_map" is mandatory
and only if running under LPAR it is possible to tell which cpus
share which cache. Second level hypervisors however do not and cannot
expose that information to guests.
In order to have a consistent view we made the choice to always only
expose information about private cpu caches via sysfs.

Example for a z196 cpu (cpu1 in /sys/devices/cpu):

cpu1/cache/index0/size -- 64K
cpu1/cache/index0/type -- Data
cpu1/cache/index0/level -- 1
cpu1/cache/index0/number_of_sets -- 64
cpu1/cache/index0/shared_cpu_map -- 00000000,00000002
cpu1/cache/index0/shared_cpu_list -- 1
cpu1/cache/index0/coherency_line_size -- 256
cpu1/cache/index0/ways_of_associativity -- 4
cpu1/cache/index1/size -- 128K
cpu1/cache/index1/type -- Instruction
cpu1/cache/index1/level -- 1
cpu1/cache/index1/number_of_sets -- 64
cpu1/cache/index1/shared_cpu_map -- 00000000,00000002
cpu1/cache/index1/shared_cpu_list -- 1
cpu1/cache/index1/coherency_line_size -- 256
cpu1/cache/index1/ways_of_associativity -- 8
cpu1/cache/index2/size -- 1536K
cpu1/cache/index2/type -- Unified
cpu1/cache/index2/level -- 2
cpu1/cache/index2/number_of_sets -- 512
cpu1/cache/index2/shared_cpu_map -- 00000000,00000002
cpu1/cache/index2/shared_cpu_list -- 1
cpu1/cache/index2/coherency_line_size -- 256
cpu1/cache/index2/ways_of_associativity -- 12
