ASoC: Avoid recalculating the bitmask for SOC_ENUM controls

For ENUM controls the bitmask is calculated based on the number of items.
Currently this is done each time the control is accessed. And while the
performance impact of this should be negligible we can easily do better. The
roundup_pow_of_two macro performs the same calculation which is currently done
manually, but it is also possible to use this macro with compile time constants
and so it can be used to initialize static data. So we can use it to initialize
the mask field of a ENUM control during its declaration.
