workqueue: convert BUG_ON()s in __queue_delayed_work() to WARN_ON_ONCE()s

8852aac25e ("workqueue: mod_delayed_work_on() shouldn't queue timer on
0 delay") unexpectedly uncovered a very nasty abuse of delayed_work in
megaraid - it allocated work_struct, casted it to delayed_work and
then pass that into queue_delayed_work().

Previously, this was okay because 0 @delay short-circuited to
queue_work() before doing anything with delayed_work.  8852aac25e
moved 0 @delay test into __queue_delayed_work() after sanity check on
delayed_work making megaraid trigger BUG_ON().

Although megaraid is already fixed by c1d390d8e6 ("megaraid: fix
BUG_ON() from incorrect use of delayed work"), this patch converts
BUG_ON()s in __queue_delayed_work() to WARN_ON_ONCE()s so that such
abusers, if there are more, trigger warning but don't crash the
machine.
