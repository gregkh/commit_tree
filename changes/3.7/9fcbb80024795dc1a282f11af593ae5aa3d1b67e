rbd: rename __rbd_init_snaps_header()

The name __rbd_init_snaps_header() doesn't really convey what that
function does very well.  Its purpose is to scan a new snapshot
context and either create or destroy snapshot device entries so
that local host's view is consistent with the reality maintained
on the OSDs.  This patch just changes the name of this function,
to be rbd_dev_snap_devs_update().  Still not perfect, but I think
better.

Also add some dynamic debug statements to this function.
