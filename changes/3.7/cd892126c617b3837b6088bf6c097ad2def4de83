rbd: encapsulate code that gets snapshot info

Create a function that encapsulates looking up the name, size and
features related to a given snapshot, which is indicated by its
index in an rbd device's snapshot context array of snapshot ids.

This interface will be used to hide differences between the format 1
and format 2 images.

At the moment this (looking up the name anyway) is slightly less
efficient than what's done currently, but we may be able to optimize
this a bit later on by cacheing the last lookup if it proves to be a
problem.
