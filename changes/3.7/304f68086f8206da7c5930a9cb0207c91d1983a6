rbd: defer registering snapshot devices

When a new snapshot is found in an rbd device's updated snapshot
context, __rbd_add_snap_dev() is called to create and insert an
entry in the rbd devices list of snapshots.  In addition, a Linux
device is registered to represent the snapshot.

For version 2 rbd images, it will be undesirable to initialize the
device right away.  So in anticipation of that, this patch separates
the insertion of a snapshot entry in the snaps list from the
creation of devices for those snapshots.

To do this, create a new function rbd_dev_snaps_register() which
traverses the list of snapshots and calls rbd_register_snap_dev()
on any that have not yet been registered.

Rename rbd_dev_snap_devs_update() to be rbd_dev_snaps_update()
to better reflect that only the entry in the snaps list and not
the snapshot's device is affected by the function.

For now, call rbd_dev_snaps_register() immediately after each
call to rbd_dev_snaps_update().
