audit: Don't pass pid or uid to audit_log_common_recv_msg

The only place we use the uid and the pid that we calculate in
audit_receive_msg is in audit_log_common_recv_msg so move the
calculation of these values into the audit_log_common_recv_msg.

Simplify the calcuation of the current pid and uid by
reading them from current instead of reading them from
NETLINK_CREDS.
