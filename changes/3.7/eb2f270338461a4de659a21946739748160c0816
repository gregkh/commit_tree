perf test: Add test to check we correctly parse and match syscall open parms

It will set up a syscall open tracepoint event, generate an open with
invalid flags, then check those flags were the ones reported in the
tracepoint fired.

For the filename we need vfs:getname, but that will go thru some more
iterations as the vfs getname codebase is going thru changes lately.

When that is in I'll just check that the perf_evsel__newtp constructor
is not bailing out and then add it to the evlist, catch the event and
check the filename against the one used in the 'open' call used to
trigger the event.
