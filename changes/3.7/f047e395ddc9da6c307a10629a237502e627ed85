drm/i915: Avoid concurrent access when marking the device as idle/busy

As suggested by Daniel, rip out the independent timers for device and
crtc busyness and integrate the manual powermanagement of the display
engine into the GEM core and its request tracking. The benefits are that
the code is a lot smaller, fewer moving parts and should fit more neatly
into the overall activity tracking of the driver.

v2: Complete overhaul and removal of the racy timers and workers.
