ext4: re-enable -o discard functionality in no-journal mode

This is a revert of commit b56ff9d397ce, which removed the call to
ext4_issue_discard() to fix a BUG reported because
ext4_issue_discard() was being called from inside a block group
spinlock.  As it turns out this bug had already been fixed by Lukas
Czerner in commit 53fdcf992d61 by the simple expedient of moving when
we call ext4_issue_discard() outside the spinlock.

So it should be safe to re-enable this functionality, which I tested
by putting an BUG_ON(in_atomic) just after the restored callsite to
ext4_issue_discard().
