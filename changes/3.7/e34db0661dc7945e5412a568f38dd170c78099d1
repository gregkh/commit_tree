[media] media: coda: set up buffers to be sized as negotiated with s_fmt

This fixes a failure in vb2_qbuf in user pointer mode where
__qbuf_userptr checks if the buffer queued by userspace is large
enough. The failure would happen if coda_queue_setup was called
with empty fmt (and thus set the expected buffer size to the maximum
resolution), and userspace queues buffers of smaller size -
corresponding to the negotiated dimensions - were queued.
Explicitly setting sizeimage to the value negotiated via s_fmt
fixes the issue.
