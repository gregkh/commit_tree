xen/apic/xenbus/swiotlb/pcifront/grant/tmem: Make functions or variables static.

There is no need for those functions/variables to be visible. Make them
static and also fix the compile warnings of this sort:

drivers/xen/<some file>.c: warning: symbol '<blah>' was not declared. Should it be static?

Some of them just require including the header file that
declares the functions.
