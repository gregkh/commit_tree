firmware loader: simplify pages ownership transfer

This patch doesn't transfer ownership of pages' buffer to the
instance of firmware until the firmware loading is completed,
which will simplify firmware_loading_store a lot, so help
to introduce the following cache_firmware and uncache_firmware
mechanism during system suspend-resume cycle.

In fact, this patch fixes one bug: if writing data into
firmware loader device is bypassed between writting 1 and 0 to
'loading', OOPS will be triggered without the patch.

Also handle the vmap failure case, and add some comments to make
code more readable.
