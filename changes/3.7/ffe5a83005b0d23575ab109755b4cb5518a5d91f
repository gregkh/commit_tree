NFS: Slow down state manager after an unhandled error

If the state manager thread is not actually able to fully recover from
some situation, it wakes up waiters, who kick off a new state manager
thread.  Quite often the fresh invocation of the state manager is just
as successful.

This results in a livelock as the client dumps thousands of NFS
requests a second on the network in a vain attempt to recover.  Not
very friendly.

To mitigate this situation, add a delay in the state manager after
an unhandled error, so that the client sends just a few requests
every second in this case.
