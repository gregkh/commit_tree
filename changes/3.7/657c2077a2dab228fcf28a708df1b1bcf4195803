PCI: Don't export stop_bus_device and remove_bus_device interfaces

The acpiphp hotplug driver was the only user of pci_stop_bus_device() and
__pci_remove_bus_device(), and it now uses pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device()
instead, so stop exposing these interfaces.

This removes these exported symbols:

    __pci_remove_bus_device
    pci_stop_bus_device
