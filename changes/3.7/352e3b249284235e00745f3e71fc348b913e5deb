fanotify: sanitize failure exits in copy_event_to_user()

* do copy_to_user() before prepare_for_access_response(); that kills
the need in remove_access_response().
* don't do fd_install() until we are past the last possible failure
exit.  Don't use sys_close() on cleanup side - just put_unused_fd()
and fput().  Less racy that way...
