workqueue: use enum value to set array size of pools in gcwq

Commit 3270476a6c0ce322354df8679652f060d66526dc ('workqueue: reimplement
WQ_HIGHPRI using a separate worker_pool') introduce separate worker_pool
for HIGHPRI. Although there is NR_WORKER_POOLS enum value which represent
size of pools, definition of worker_pool in gcwq doesn't use it.
Using it makes code robust and prevent future mistakes.
So change code to use this enum value.
