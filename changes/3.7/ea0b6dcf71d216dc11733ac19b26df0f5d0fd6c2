MODSIGN: Provide Kconfig options

Provide kernel configuration options for module signing.

The following configuration options are added:

     CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA1
     CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA224
     CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA256
     CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA384
     CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA512

These select the cryptographic hash used to digest the data prior to signing.
Additionally, the crypto module selected will be built into the kernel as it
won't be possible to load it as a module without incurring a circular
dependency when the kernel tries to check its signature.
