kpageflags: fix wrong KPF_THP on non-huge compound pages

KPF_THP can be set on non-huge compound pages (like slab pages or pages
allocated by drivers with __GFP_COMP) because PageTransCompound only
checks PG_head and PG_tail.  Obviously this is a bug and breaks user space
applications which look for thp via /proc/kpageflags.

This patch rules out setting KPF_THP wrongly by additionally checking
PageLRU on the head pages.
