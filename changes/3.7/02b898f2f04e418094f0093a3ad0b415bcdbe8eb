md/raid1: Fix assembling of arrays containing Replacements.

setup_conf in raid1.c uses conf->raid_disks before assigning
a value.  It is used when including 'Replacement' devices.

The consequence is that assembling an array which contains a
replacement will misbehave and either not include the replacement, or
not include the device being replaced.

Though this doesn't lead directly to data corruption, it could lead to
reduced data safety.

So use mddev->raid_disks, which is initialised, instead.

Bug was introduced by commit c19d57980b38a5bb613a898937a1cf85f422fb9b
      md/raid1: recognise replacements when assembling arrays.

in 3.3, so fix is suitable for 3.3.y thru 3.6.y.
