IB/ipoib: Add rtnl_link_ops support

Add rtnl_link_ops to IPoIB, with the first usage being child device
create/delete through them. Childs devices are now either legacy ones,
created/deleted through the ipoib sysfs entries, or RTNL ones.

Adding support for RTNL childs involved refactoring of ipoib_vlan_add
which is now used by both the sysfs and the link_ops code.

Also, added ndo_uninit entry to support calling unregister_netdevice_queue
from the rtnl dellink entry. This required removal of calls to
ipoib_dev_cleanup from the driver in flows which use unregister_netdevice,
since the networking core will invoke ipoib_uninit which does exactly that.
