Staging: ipack: implement ipack device table.

The modaliases look like ipack:fXvNdM, where X is the format version (8
bit) and N and M are the vendor and device ID represented as 32 bit
hexadecimal numbers each. Using 32 bits allows us to define IPACK_ANY_ID
as (~0) without interfering with the valid ids.

The resulting modalias string for ipoctal.ko looks like this (once
ipoctal provides a device table):
alias:          ipack:f01v000000F0d00000048*
alias:          ipack:f01v000000F0d0000002A*
alias:          ipack:f01v000000F0d00000022*
(output from modinfo)
