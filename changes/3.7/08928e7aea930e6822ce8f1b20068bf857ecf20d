ARM: 7495/1: mutex: use generic atomic_dec-based implementation for ARMv6+

Commit a76d7bd96d65 ("ARM: 7467/1: mutex: use generic xchg-based
implementation for ARMv6+") removed the barrier-less, ARM-specific
mutex implementation in favour of the generic xchg-based code.

Since then, a bug was uncovered in the xchg code when running on SMP
platforms, due to interactions between the locking paths and the
MUTEX_SPIN_ON_OWNER code. This was fixed in 0bce9c46bf3b ("mutex: place
lock in contended state after fastpath_lock failure"), however, the
atomic_dec-based mutex algorithm is now marginally more efficient for
ARM (~0.5% improvement in hackbench scores on dual A15).

This patch moves ARMv6+ platforms to the atomic_dec-based mutex code.
