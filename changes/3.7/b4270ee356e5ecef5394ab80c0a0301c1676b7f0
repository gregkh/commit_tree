rcu: Permit RCU_NONIDLE() to be used from interrupt context

There is a need to use RCU from interrupt context, but either before
rcu_irq_enter() is called or after rcu_irq_exit() is called.  If the
interrupt occurs from idle, then lockdep-RCU will complain about such
uses, as they appear to be illegal uses of RCU from the idle loop.
In other environments, RCU_NONIDLE() could be used to properly protect
the use of RCU, but RCU_NONIDLE() currently cannot be invoked except
from process context.

This commit therefore modifies RCU_NONIDLE() to permit its use more
globally.
