arm: optimized current_pt_regs()

... no need to read current_thread_info()->task only to
feed it to task_thread_page() immediately afterwards.
Moreover, not using current_thread_info() at all ends
up with better assembler - we need a location very close
to the top of kernel stack page and it's actually better
to do or with 0x1fff, followed be subtracting a small
constant than and with ~0x1fff, followed by adding a large
one.  Both & and | would be a couple of insns (mvn lsr/mvn lsl
for |, a pair of bic for &), but the following addition
would cost a pair of add while the subtraction ends up
as a single sub.
