fat (exportfs): fix dentry reconnection

Maintain an index of directory inodes by starting cluster, so that
fat_get_parent() can return the proper cached inode rather than inventing
one that cannot be traced back to the filesystem root.

Add a new msdos/vfat binary mount option "nfs" so that FAT filesystems
that are _not_ exported via NFS are not saddled with maintenance of an
index they will never use.

Finally, simplify NFS file handle generation and lookups.  An
ext2-congruent implementation is adequate for FAT needs.
