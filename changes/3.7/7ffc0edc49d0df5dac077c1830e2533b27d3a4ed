memcg: move mem_cgroup_is_root upwards

kmem code uses this function and it is better to not use forward
declarations for static inline functions as some (older) compilers don't
like it:

gcc version 4.3.4 [gcc-4_3-branch revision 152973] (SUSE Linux)

  mm/memcontrol.c:421: warning: `mem_cgroup_is_root' declared inline after being called
  mm/memcontrol.c:421: warning: previous declaration of `mem_cgroup_is_root' was here
