[SCSI] ibmvfc: Fix double completion on abort timeout

If an abort request times out to the virtual fibre channel adapter,
the ibmvfc driver will kick off a reset of the adapter. This
patch ensures we wait for the both the abort request and the
request being aborted to be completed prior to exiting the
eh_abort handler. This fixes a bug where the ibmvfc driver
was erroneously returning success to the eh_abort handler
then later sending back a response to the same command.
