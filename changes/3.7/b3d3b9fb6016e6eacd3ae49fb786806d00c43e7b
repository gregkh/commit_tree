PM / Domains: Fix compilation warning related to genpd_start_dev_no_timing()

Function genpd_start_dev_no_timing was accessed inside CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME
macro but defined outside it. When the above macro was not defined the
compiler gave the following warning:

drivers/base/power/domain.c:96:12: warning:
‘genpd_start_dev_no_timing’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
