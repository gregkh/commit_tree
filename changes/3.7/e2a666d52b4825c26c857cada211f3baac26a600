kbuild: sign the modules at install time

Linus deleted the old code and put signing on the install command,
I fixed it to extract the keyid and signer-name within sign-file
and cleaned up that script now it always signs in-place.

Some enthusiast should convert sign-key to perl and pull
x509keyid into it.
