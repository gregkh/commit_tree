[media] af9033: prevent unintended underflow

As spotted by Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com> (thanks!), we have
improperly used an unsigned variable in a calculation that may result in a
negative number. This may cause an unintended underflow if the interface
frequency of the tuner is > approx. 40MHz.
This patch should resolve the issue, following an approach similar to what is
used in af9013.c.
