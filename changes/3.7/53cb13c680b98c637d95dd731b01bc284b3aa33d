sfc: Replace tso_state::full_packet_space with ip_base_len

We only use tso_state::full_packet_space to calculate the IPv4 tot_len
or IPv6 payload_len, not to set tso_state::packet_space.  Replace it
with an ip_base_len field holding the value of tot_len or payload_len
before including the TCP payload, which is much more useful when
constructing the new headers.
