spi/topcliff-pch: Fix device remove function

The call sequence spi_alloc_master/spi_register_master/spi_unregister_master
is complete; it reduces the device reference count to zero, which results in
device memory being freed. An extra call to spi_master_put is unnecessary
and results in an access to free memory. Drop it.

Also, the device subsystem resets device driver data to NULL after the call to
the remove function returns, so there is no need to do it here.
