powerpc/eeh: Remove PE at appropriate time

During PCI hotplug and EEH recovery, the PE hierarchy tree might be
changed due to the PCI topology changes. At later point when the
PCI device is added, the PE will be created dynamically again.

The patch introduces new function to remove EEH devices from the
associated PE. That also can cause that the parent PE is removed
from the PE tree if the parent PE doesn't include valid EEH devices
and child PEs.
