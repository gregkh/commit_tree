mm: fix potential anon_vma locking issue in mprotect()

Fix an anon_vma locking issue in the following situation:

- vma has no anon_vma
- next has an anon_vma
- vma is being shrunk / next is being expanded, due to an mprotect call

We need to take next's anon_vma lock to avoid races with rmap users (such
as page migration) while next is being expanded.
