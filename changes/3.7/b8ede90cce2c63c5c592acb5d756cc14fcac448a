m32r_sio: remove dependency on struct serial_uart_config

The struct serial_uart_config is hardly used at all, and the
use case like this one are somewhat needless.  Remove the
trivial usage so that we can remove serial_uart_config.

Since the type field isn't really used at all, we also delete
the initialization and references of it here as well.
