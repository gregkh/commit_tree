staging: comedi: s526: don't dereference insn->data pointer

The comedi_insn 'data' pointer is a __user pointer that is
passed into the kernel using an ioctl. The comedi core copies
this data to kernel space in do_insnlist_ioctl() and then
passes that kernel data to the drivers as a separate parameter.
The drivers never need to access the data through the insn->data
pointer.

This fixes a number of sparse warnings about:

  warning: dereference of noderef expression
