ixgbe: Make allocating skb and placing data in it a separate function

This patch creates a function named ixgbe_fetch_rx_buffer. The sole
purpose of this function is to retrieve a single buffer off of the ring and
to place it in an skb.

The advantage to doing this is that it helps improve the readability since
I can decrease the indentation and for the code in this section.
