perf symbols: Introduce symsrc structure.

Factors opening of certain sections & tracking certain elf info into an
external structure.

The goal here is to keep multiple elfs (and their looked up
sections/indexes) around during the symbol generation process (in
dso__load()).

We need this to properly resolve symbols on PPC due to the use of
function descriptors & the .opd section (ie: symbols which are functions
don't point to their actual location, they point to their function
descriptor in .opd which contains their actual location.

It would be possible to just keep the (Elf *) around, but then we'd end
up with duplicate code for looking up the same sections and checking for
the existence of an important section wouldn't be as clean (and we need
to keep the Elf stuff confined to symtab-elf.c).

Utilized by the later patch
"perf symbols: Use both runtime and debug images"
