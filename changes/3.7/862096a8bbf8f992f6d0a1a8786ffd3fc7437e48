IB/ipoib: Add more rtnl_link_ops callbacks

Add the rtnl_link_ops changelink and fill_info callbacks, through
which the admin can now set/get the driver mode, etc policies.
Maintain the proprietary sysfs entries only for legacy childs.

For child devices, set dev->iflink to point to the parent
device ifindex, such that user space tools can now correctly
show the uplink relation as done for vlan, macvlan, etc
devices. Pointed out by Patrick McHardy <kaber@trash.net>
