powerpc/mm: Match variable types to API

sys_subpage_prot() takes an unsigned long for 'addr' then does some stuff
with it and the result is stored in a signed int, i, which is eventually
used as the size parameter in a copy_from_user call.  Update 'i' to be an
unsigned long as well and since 'nw' is used in a size_t context which,
depending on whether this is 32- or 64-bit may be unsigned int or unsigned
long, switch that to a size_t and always be right.

Finally, since we're in the neighbourhood, make the same changes to
subpage_prot_clear().
