gen_init_cpio: avoid stack overflow when expanding

Fix possible overflow of the buffer used for expanding environment
variables when building file list.

In the extremely unlikely case of an attacker having control over the
environment variables visible to gen_init_cpio, control over the
contents of the file gen_init_cpio parses, and gen_init_cpio was built
without compiler hardening, the attacker can gain arbitrary execution
control via a stack buffer overflow.

  $ cat usr/crash.list
  file foo ${BIG}${BIG}${BIG}${BIG}${BIG}${BIG} 0755 0 0
  $ BIG=$(perl -e 'print "A" x 4096;') ./usr/gen_init_cpio usr/crash.list
  *** buffer overflow detected ***: ./usr/gen_init_cpio terminated

This also replaces the space-indenting with tabs.

Patch based on existing fix extracted from grsecurity.
