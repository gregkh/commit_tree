ASoC: jack: Always update jack state even for noop changes

Now that DAPM is very cheap for most updates we've no need to avoid trying
to run it so always notify even if we don't think there are any changes.
This avoids potential issues with bootstrapping state like the pin state
or other notifiers when there's nothing in the jack.
