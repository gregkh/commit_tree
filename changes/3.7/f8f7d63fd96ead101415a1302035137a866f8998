powerpc/eeh: Trace eeh device from I/O cache

The idea comes from Benjamin Herrenschmidt. The eeh cache helps
fetching the pci device according to the given I/O address. Since
the eeh cache is serving for eeh, it's reasonable for eeh cache
to trace eeh device except pci device.

The patch make eeh cache to trace eeh device. Also, the major
eeh entry function eeh_dn_check_failure has been renamed to
eeh_dev_check_failure since it will take eeh device as input
parameter.
