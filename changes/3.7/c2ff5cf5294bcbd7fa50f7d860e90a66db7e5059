iommu/amd: Work around wrong IOAPIC device-id in IVRS table

On some systems the BIOS puts the wrong device-id for the
IO-APIC into the IVRS table. The result is that interrupt
remapping is not working for the IO-APIC irqs. This usually
means a kernel panic at boot because the timer is not
working.
Fix this kernel panic by disabling interrupt remapping if
this problem is discovered in the IVRS table.
