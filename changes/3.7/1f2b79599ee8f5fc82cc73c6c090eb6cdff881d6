firmware loader: always let firmware_buf own the pages buffer

This patch always let firmware_buf own the pages buffer allocated
inside firmware_data_write, and add all instances of firmware_buf
into the firmware cache global list. Also introduce one private field
in 'struct firmware', so release_firmware will see the instance of
firmware_buf associated with the current firmware instance, then just
'free' the instance of firmware_buf.

The firmware_buf instance represents one pages buffer for one
firmware image, so lots of firmware loading requests can share
the same firmware_buf instance if they request the same firmware
image file.

This patch will make implementation of the following cache_firmware/
uncache_firmware very easy and simple.

In fact, the patch improves request_formware/release_firmware:

        - only request userspace to write firmware image once if
	several devices share one same firmware image and its drivers
	call request_firmware concurrently.
