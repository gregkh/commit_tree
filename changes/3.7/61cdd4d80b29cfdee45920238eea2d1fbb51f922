tipc: add __read_mostly annotations to several global variables

Added to the following:

 - tipc_random
 - tipc_own_addr
 - tipc_max_ports
 - tipc_net_id
 - tipc_remote_management
 - handler_enabled

The above global variables are read often, but written rarely. Use
__read_mostly to prevent them being on the same cacheline as another
variable which is written to often, which would cause cacheline
bouncing.
