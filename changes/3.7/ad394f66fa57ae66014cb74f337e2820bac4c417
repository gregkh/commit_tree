kdb: Implement disable_nmi command

This command disables NMI-entry. If NMI source has been previously shared
with a serial console ("debug port"), this effectively releases the port
from KDB exclusive use, and makes the console available for normal use.

Of course, NMI can be reenabled, enable_nmi modparam is used for that:

	echo 1 > /sys/module/kdb/parameters/enable_nmi
