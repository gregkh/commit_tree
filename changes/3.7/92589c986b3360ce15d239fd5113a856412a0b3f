rtc-proc: permit the /proc/driver/rtc device to use other devices

To get time information via /proc/driver/rtc, only the first device (rtc0)
is used.  If the rtcN (eg.  rtc1 or rtc2) is used for the system clock,
there is no way to get information of rtcN via /proc/driver/rtc.  With
this patch, the time data can be retrieved from the system clock RTC.

If the RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE is not defined, then rtc0 is used by default.
