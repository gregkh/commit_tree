uprobes: Kill UTASK_BP_HIT state

Kill UTASK_BP_HIT state, it buys nothing but complicates the code.
It is only used in uprobe_notify_resume() to decide who should be
called, we can check utask->active_uprobe != NULL instead. And this
allows us to simplify handle_swbp(), no need to clear utask->state.

Likewise we could kill UTASK_SSTEP, but UTASK_BP_HIT is worse and
imho should die. The problem is, it creates the special case when
task->utask is NULL, we can't distinguish RUNNING and BP_HIT. With
this patch utask == NULL always means RUNNING.
