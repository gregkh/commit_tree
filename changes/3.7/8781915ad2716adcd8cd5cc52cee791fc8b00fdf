trace: Move trace event enable from fs_initcall to core_initcall

This patch splits trace event initialization in two stages:
 * ftrace enable
 * sysfs event entry creation

This allows to capture trace events from an earlier point
by using 'trace_event' kernel parameter and is important
to trace boot-up allocations.

Note that, in order to enable events at core_initcall,
it's necessary to move init_ftrace_syscalls() from
core_initcall to early_initcall.
