USB: whiteheat: fix port-data memory leak

Fix port-data memory leak by moving port data allocation and
deallocation to port_probe and port_remove.

Since commit 0998d0631001288 (device-core: Ensure drvdata = NULL when no
driver is bound) the port private data is no longer freed at release as
it is no longer accessible.

Note that the fifth port (command port) is never registered as a
port device and thus should be handled in attach and release.

Compile-only tested.
