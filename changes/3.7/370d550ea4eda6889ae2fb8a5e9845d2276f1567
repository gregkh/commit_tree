[SCSI] qla2xxx: Fix for continuous rescan attempts in arbitrated loop topology.

Stale information in the temporary fcport created in
qla2x00_configure_local_loop() causes qla2x00_get_port_database() call
to fail. This reschedules scan, which gets stuck continuously in the
rescheduling-of-scan loop due to the failure.
