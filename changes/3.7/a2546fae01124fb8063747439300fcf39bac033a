ftrace: Add -mfentry to Makefile on function tracer

Thanks to Andi Kleen, gcc 4.6.0 now supports -mfentry for x86
(and hopefully soon for other archs). What this does is to have
the function profiler start at the beginning of the function
instead of after the stack is set up. As plain -pg (mcount) is
called after the stack is set up, and in some cases can have issues
with the function graph tracer. It also requires frame pointers to
be enabled.

The -mfentry now calls __fentry__ at the beginning of the function.
This allows for compiling without frame pointers and even has the
ability to access parameters if needed.

If the architecture and the compiler both support -mfentry then
use that instead.
