hv: vmbus_drv: detect hyperv through x86_hyper

There are two reasons we need to use x86_hyper instead of
query_hypervisor_presence():

- Not only hyperv but also other hypervisors such as kvm would set
  X86_FEATURE_HYTPERVISOR, so query_hypervisor_presence() will return true even
  in kvm. This may cause extra delay of 5 seconds before failing the probing in
  kvm guest.
- The hypervisor has been detected in init_hypervisor(), so no need to do the
  work again.
