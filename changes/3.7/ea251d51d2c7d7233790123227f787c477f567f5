perf hists: Introduce perf_hpp for hist period printing

Current hist print functions are messy because it has to consider many
of command line options and the code doing that is scattered around to
places. So when someone wants to add an option to manipulate the hist
output it'd very easy to miss to update all of them in sync. And things
getting worse as more options/features are added continuously.

So I'd like to refactor them using hpp formats and move common code to
ui/hist.c in order to make it easy to maintain and to add new features.
