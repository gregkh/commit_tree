Return the right error value when dup[23]() newfd argument is too large

Jack Lin reports that the error return from dup3() for the RLIMIT_NOFILE
case changed incorrectly after 3.6.

The culprit is commit f33ff9927f42 ("take rlimit check to callers of
expand_files()") which when it moved the "return -EMFILE" out to the
caller, didn't notice that the dup3() had special code to turn the
EMFILE return into EBADF.

The replace_fd() helper that got added later then inherited the bug too.
