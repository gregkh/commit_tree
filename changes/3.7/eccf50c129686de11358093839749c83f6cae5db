nfsd: remove unused listener-removal interfaces

You can use nfsd/portlist to give nfsd additional sockets to listen on.
In theory you can also remove listening sockets this way.  But nobody's
ever done that as far as I can tell.

Also this was partially broken in 2.6.25, by
a217813f9067b785241cb7f31956e51d2071703a "knfsd: Support adding
transports by writing portlist file".

(Note that we decide whether to take the "delfd" case by checking for a
digit--but what's actually expected in that case is something made by
svc_one_sock_name(), which won't begin with a digit.)

So, let's just rip out this stuff.
