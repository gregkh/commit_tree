IB/mlx4: Add iov directory in sysfs under the ib device

This directory is added only for the master -- slaves do not have it.

The sysfs iov directory is used to manage and examine the port P_Key
and guid paravirtualization.

Under iov/ports, the administrator may examine the gid and P_Key tables
as they are present in the device (and as are seen in the "network
view" presented to the SM).

Under the iov/<pci slot number> directories, the admin may map the
index numbers in the physical tables (as under iov/ports) to the
paravirtualized index numbers that guests see.

For example, if the administrator, for port 1 on guest 2 maps physical
pkey index 10 to virtual index 1, then that guest, whenever it uses
its pkey index 1, will actually be using the real pkey index 10.
