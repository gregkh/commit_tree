SUNRPC: Get rid of the xs_error_report socket callback

Chris Perl reports that we're seeing races between the wakeup call in
xs_error_report and the connect attempts. Basically, Chris has shown
that in certain circumstances, the call to xs_error_report causes the
rpc_task that is responsible for reconnecting to wake up early, thus
triggering a disconnect and retry.

Since the sk->sk_error_report() calls in the socket layer are always
followed by a tcp_done() in the cases where we care about waking up
the rpc_tasks, just let the state_change callbacks take responsibility
for those wake ups.
