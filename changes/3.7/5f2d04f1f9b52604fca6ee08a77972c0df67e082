ipv4: fix path MTU discovery with connection tracking

IPv4 conntrack defragments incoming packet at the PRE_ROUTING hook and
(in case of forwarded packets) refragments them at POST_ROUTING
independent of the IP_DF flag. Refragmentation uses the dst_mtu() of
the local route without caring about the original fragment sizes,
thereby breaking PMTUD.

This patch fixes this by keeping track of the largest received fragment
with IP_DF set and generates an ICMP fragmentation required error during
refragmentation if that size exceeds the MTU.
