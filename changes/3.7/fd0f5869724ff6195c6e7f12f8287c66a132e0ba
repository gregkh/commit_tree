x86: Distinguish TLB shootdown interrupts from other functions call interrupts

As TLB shootdown requests to other CPU cores are now using function call
interrupts, TLB shootdowns entry in /proc/interrupts is always shown as 0.

This behavior change was introduced by commit 52aec3308db8 ("x86/tlb:
replace INVALIDATE_TLB_VECTOR by CALL_FUNCTION_VECTOR").

This patch reverts TLB shootdowns entry in /proc/interrupts to count TLB
shootdowns separately from the other function call interrupts.
