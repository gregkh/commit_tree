[media] dvb_usb_v2: pass device name too using (struct usb_device_id)

Pass all the needed data to the DVB USB core using
(struct usb_device_id) .driver_info. That simplifies
old code a lot and saves memory	as all device IDs and
names are not defined inside (struct dvb_usb_device_properties)
as earlier.
