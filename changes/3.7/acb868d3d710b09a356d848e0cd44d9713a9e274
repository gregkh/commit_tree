drm/i915: Disallow preallocation of requests

The intention was to allow the caller to avoid a failure to queue a
request having already written commands to the ring. However, this is a
moot point as the i915_add_request() can fail for other reasons than a
mere allocation failure and those failure cases are more likely than
ENOMEM. So the overlay code already had to handle i915_add_request()
failures, and due to

    drm/i915: Allow late allocation of request for i915_add_request()

the error handling code in intel_overlay.c was subject to causing
double-frees, as found by coverity.

Rather than further complicate i915_add_request() and callers, realise
the battle is lost and adapt intel_overlay.c to take advantage of the
late allocation of requests.

v2: Handle callers passing in a NULL seqno.
v3: Ditto. This time for sure.
