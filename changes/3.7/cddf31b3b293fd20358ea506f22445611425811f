Thermal: Rename thermal_instance.node to thermal_instance.tz_node.

thermal_instance should be referenced by both thermal zone devices
and thermal cooling devices.

Rename thermal_instance.node to thermal_instance.tz_node in this patch
and thermal_instanace.cdev_node will be introduced in next patch.
