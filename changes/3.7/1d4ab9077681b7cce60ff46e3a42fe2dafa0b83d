[CIFS] Fix indentation of fs/cifs/Kconfig entries

make menuconfig for cifs shows multiple entries toward

(probably a bug in Kconfig parsing of items
that are dependant on the module (cifs=m instead of
just CONFIG_CIFS).  This patch fixes the indentation
of all but the last entry (CIFS_ACL) which I don't
know how to fix. It also clarifies wording in
two places
