pwm: pwm-tiehrpwm: Add support for configuring polarity of PWM

EHRPWM hardware supports polarity configuration of PWM output. However
configuration of polarity done in hardware only in .enable() to ensure
PWM output present only after enabling PWM. This commit adds support for
polarity configuration for EHRPWM.
When being here, remove configuring of polarity during .config() and do
it explicitly from .set_polarity().
