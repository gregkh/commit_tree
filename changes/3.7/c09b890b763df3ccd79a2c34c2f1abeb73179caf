spi/imx: set the inactive state of the clock according to the clock polarity

There are SPI devices which need a SPI clock with active low polarity and
high inactive state.

Add the setting of the inactive state ECSPIx_CONFIGREG:SCLK CTL
according to the clock polarity ECSPIx_CONFIGREG:SCLK POL:

DT without "spi-cpol" = 0 = clock active high polarity = inactive state low
DT with    "spi-cpol" = 1 = clock active low  polarity = inactive state high
