powerpc/eeh: Trace error based on PE from beginning

There're 2 conditions to trigger EEH error detection: invalid value
returned from reading I/O or config space. On each case, the function
eeh_dn_check_failure will be called to initialize EEH event and put
it into the poll for further processing.

The patch changes the function for a little bit so that the EEH error
will be traced based on PE instead of EEH device any more. Also, the
function eeh_find_device_pe() has been removed since the eeh device
is tracing the PE by struct eeh_dev::pe.
