gpio: gpio-ich: Share ownership of GPIO groups

The ICH chips have their GPIO pins organized in 2 or 3 independent
groups of 32 GPIO pins. It can happen that the ACPI BIOS wants to make
use of pins in one group, preventing the OS to access these. This does
not prevent the OS from accessing the other group(s).

This is the case for example on my Asus Z8NA-D6 board. The ACPI BIOS
wants to control GPIO 18 (group 1), while I (the OS) need to control
GPIO 52 and 53 (group 2) for SMBus multiplexing.

So instead of checking for ACPI resource conflict on the whole I/O
range, check on a per-group basis, and consider it a success if at
least one of the groups is available for the OS to use.
