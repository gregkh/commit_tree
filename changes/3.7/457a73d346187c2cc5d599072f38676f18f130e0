usb: host: xhci: Fix Null pointer dereferencing with 71c731a for non-x86 systems

In 71c731a: usb: host: xhci: Fix Compliance Mode on SN65LVPE502CP Hardware
when extracting DMI strings (vendor or product_name) to mark them as quirk
we may get NULL pointer in case of non-x86 systems which won't define
CONFIG_DMI. Hence susbsequent strstr() calls crash while driver probing.

So, returning 'false' here in case we get a NULL vendor or product_name.

This is tested with ARM (exynos) system.

This patch should be backported to stable kernels as old as 3.6, that
contain the commit 71c731a296f1b08a3724bd1b514b64f1bda87a23 "usb: host:
xhci: Fix Compliance Mode on SN65LVPE502CP Hardware"
