staging: comedi: adl_pci9111: analog input subdevice is fixed

The analog input subdevice is the same for all boards supported by
this driver. Remove the boardinfo just open-code the values in the
attach function.

Note: the only other board that could be supported by this driver is
the ADLink PCI-9111DG board. This board has 12-bit analog inputs
instead of the 16-bit inputs of the PCI-9111HR board. Unfortunately
these boards share the same PCI vendor/device id.
