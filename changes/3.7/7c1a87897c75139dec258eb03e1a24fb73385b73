Input: MT - Add in-kernel tracking

With the INPUT_MT_TRACK flag set, the function input_mt_assign_slots()
can be used to match a new set of contacts against the currently used
slots. The algorithm used is based on Lagrange relaxation, and performs
very well in practice; slower than mtdev for a few corner cases, but
faster in most commonly occuring cases.
