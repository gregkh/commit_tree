firmware loader: fix device lifetime

Callers of request_firmware* must hold the reference count of
@device, otherwise it is easy to trigger oops since the firmware
loader device is the child of @device.

This patch adds comments about the usage. In fact, most of drivers
call request_firmware* in its probe() or open(), so the constraint
should be reasonable and can be satisfied.

Also this patch holds the reference count of @device before
schedule_work() in request_firmware_nowait() to avoid that
the @device is released after request_firmware_nowait returns
and before the worker function is scheduled.
