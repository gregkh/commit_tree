wlcore: Don't recover during boot

While recursive recovery is avoided during shutdown, a new recovery may
be queued when the FW boots. The recovery work will then try to stop an
already stopped hardware, which will most likely result in a kernel
panic.

Fix this by verifying that wl->state is on before queueing a new
recovery.
