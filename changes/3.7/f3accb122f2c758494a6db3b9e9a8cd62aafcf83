ARM: export default read_current_timer

read_current_timer is used by get_cycles since "ARM: 7538/1: delay:
add registration mechanism for delay timer sources", and get_cycles
can be used by device drivers in loadable modules, so it has to
be exported.

Without this patch, building imote2_defconfig fails with

ERROR: "read_current_timer" [crypto/tcrypt.ko] undefined!
