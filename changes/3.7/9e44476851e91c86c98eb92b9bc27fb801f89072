MD: raid5 avoid unnecessary zero page for trim

We want to avoid zero discarded dev page, because it's useless for discard.
But if we don't zero it, another read/write hit such page in the cache and will
get inconsistent data.

To avoid zero the page, we don't set R5_UPTODATE flag after construction is
done. In this way, discard write request is still issued and finished, but read
will not hit the page. If the stripe gets accessed soon, we need reread the
stripe, but since the chance is low, the reread isn't a big deal.
