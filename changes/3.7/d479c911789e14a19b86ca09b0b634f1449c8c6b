USB: ehci-fsl: Return valid error in ehci_fsl_setup_phy

ehci_fsl_setup_phy is supposed to return an int, but had a void return
value in the case of controller_ver being invalid.

Introduced by commit 3735ba8db8e6 ("powerpc/usb: fix bug of CPU hang
when missing USB PHY clock"), which missed one return.
