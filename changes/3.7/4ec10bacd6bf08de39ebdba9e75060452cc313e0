[media] soc-camera: Add and use soc_camera_power_[on|off]() helper functions

Instead of forcing all soc-camera drivers to go through the mid-layer to
handle power management, create soc_camera_power_[on|off]() functions
that can be called from the subdev .s_power() operation to manage
regulators and platform-specific power handling. This allows non
soc-camera hosts to use soc-camera-aware clients.
