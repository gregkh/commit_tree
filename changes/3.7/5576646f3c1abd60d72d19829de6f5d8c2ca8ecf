revert "mm: fix-up zone present pages"

Revert commit 7f1290f2f2a4 ("mm: fix-up zone present pages")

That patch tried to fix a issue when calculating zone->present_pages,
but it caused a regression on 32bit systems with HIGHMEM.  With that
change, reset_zone_present_pages() resets all zone->present_pages to
zero, and fixup_zone_present_pages() is called to recalculate
zone->present_pages when the boot allocator frees core memory pages into
buddy allocator.  Because highmem pages are not freed by bootmem
allocator, all highmem zones' present_pages becomes zero.

Various options for improving the situation are being discussed but for
now, let's return to the 3.6 code.
