usb: renesas_usbhs: fixup __usbhs_for_each_pipe 1st pos

__usbhs_for_each_pipe() is the macro which moves around each pipe,
but it has a bug which didn't care about 1st pipe's position.
Because of this bug, it moves around
pipe0, pipe2, pipe3 ... even though it requested pipe1, pipe2, pipe3...
This patch modifies it.
