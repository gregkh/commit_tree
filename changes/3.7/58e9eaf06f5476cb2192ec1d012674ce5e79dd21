perf/x86: Remove P6 cpuc->enabled check

Between 2.6.33 and 2.6.34 the PMU code was made modular.

The x86_pmu_enable() call was extended to disable cpuc->enabled
and iterate the counters, enabling one at a time, before calling
enable_all() at the end, followed by re-enabling cpuc->enabled.

Since cpuc->enabled was set to 0, that change effectively caused
the "val |= ARCH_PERFMON_EVENTSEL_ENABLE;" code in p6_pmu_enable_event()
and p6_pmu_disable_event() to be dead code that was never called.

This change removes this code (which was confusing) and adds some
extra commentary to make it more clear what is going on.
