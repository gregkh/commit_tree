virtio_mmio: Don't attempt to create empty virtqueues

If a virtio device reports a QueueNumMax of 0, vring_new_virtqueue()
doesn't check this, and thanks to an unsigned (i < num - 1) loop
guard, scribbles over memory when initialising the free list.

Avoid by not trying to create zero-descriptor queues, as there's no
way to do any I/O with one.
