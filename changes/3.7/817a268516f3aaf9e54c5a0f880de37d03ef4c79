PCI: Use correct type when freeing bus resource list

Should use struct pci_bus_resource instead of struct pci_host_bridge_window

Commit 45ca9e9730 ("PCI: add helpers for building PCI bus resource lists")
added pci_free_resource_list() and used it in pci_bus_remove_resources().
Later it was also used for host bridge aperture lists, which was fine until
commit 0efd5aab41 ("PCI: add struct pci_host_bridge_window with CPU/bus
address offset").  That commit added offset information, so we needed a
struct pci_host_bridge_window that was separate from struct
pci_bus_resource.

Commit 0efd5aab41 should have split the host bridge aperture users of
pci_free_resource_list() from the pci_bus_resource user
(pci_bus_remove_resources()), but it did not.
