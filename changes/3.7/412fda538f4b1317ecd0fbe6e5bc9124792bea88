NFC: Changed HCI and PN544 HCI driver to use the new HCI LLC Core

The previous shdlc HCI driver and its header are removed from the tree.
PN544 now registers directly with HCI and passes the name of the llc it
requires (shdlc).
HCI instantiation now allocates the required llc instance. The llc is
started when the HCI device is brought up.
