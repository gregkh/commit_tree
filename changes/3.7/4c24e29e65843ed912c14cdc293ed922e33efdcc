rtc_sysfs_show_hctosys(): display 0 if resume failed

Without this patch /sys/class/rtc/$CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE/hctosys
contains a 1 (meaning "This rtc was used to initialize the system
clock") even if setting the time by do_settimeofday() at bootup failed.
The RTC can also be used to set the clock on resume, if it did 1,
otherwise 0.  Previously there was no indication if the RTC was used
to set the clock in resume.

This uses only CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE for conditional compilation
instead of it and CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS to be more consistent.
rtc_hctosys_ret was moved to class.c so class.c no longer depends on
hctosys.c.
