perf, powerpc: Fix hw breakpoints returning -ENOSPC

I've been trying to get hardware breakpoints with perf to work
on POWER7 but I'm getting the following:

  % perf record -e mem:0x10000000 true

    Error: sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 28 (No space left on device).  /bin/dmesg may provide additional information.

    Fatal: No CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y kernel support configured?

  true: Terminated

(FWIW adding -a and it works fine)

Debugging it seems that __reserve_bp_slot() is returning ENOSPC
because it thinks there are no free breakpoint slots on this
CPU.

I have a 2 CPUs, so perf userspace is doing two perf_event_open
syscalls to add a counter to each CPU [1].  The first syscall
succeeds but the second is failing.

On this second syscall, fetch_bp_busy_slots() sets slots.pinned
to be 1, despite there being no breakpoint on this CPU.  This is
because the call the task_bp_pinned, checks all CPUs, rather
than just the current CPU. POWER7 only has one hardware
breakpoint per CPU (ie. HBP_NUM=1), so we return ENOSPC.

The following patch fixes this by checking the associated CPU
for each breakpoint in task_bp_pinned.  I'm not familiar with
this code, so it's provided as a reference to the above issue.
