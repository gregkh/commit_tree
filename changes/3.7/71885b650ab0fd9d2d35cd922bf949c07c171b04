mtd: mxc_nand: swap iomem resource order

The i.MX v3 nand controller (i.MX5) needs two memory resources.
Traditionally we have the AXI resource first. For sorting in this
driver into the devicetree it feels much more natural to have the
IP resource first. This patch swaps the ordering of these two
resources.
