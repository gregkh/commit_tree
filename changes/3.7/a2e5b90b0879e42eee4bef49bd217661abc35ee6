   ARM: OMAP2+: gpmc: minimal driver support

It now requests a clock with con-id "fck" otherwise the probe will fails.

[    0.342010] omap-gpmc omap-gpmc: error: clk_get
[    0.346771] omap-gpmc: probe of omap-gpmc failed with error -2

Add the "omap-gmpc" dev-id and fck con-id to the already existing
gmpc-fck dummy clock.
