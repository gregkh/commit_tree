ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: add support for lostcontext_mask

Currently hwmod only provides the offset for the context lose
register, and if we attempt to share the same register between two or
more hwmods, the resulting context loss counts get wrong. Thus, we
need a way to specify which bits are used for the context loss
information for each.  This is accomplished by adding a new field to
the omap4 prcm struct, 'lostcontext_mask', which specifies a bit-mask
to use for filtering the register.

Mark the affected hwmods appropriately.  'l4_abe' hwmod uses the
LOSTMEM_AESSMEM bit of RM_ABE_AESS_CONTEXT register, as l4_abe doesn't
have its own dedicated register for this purpose. This register is
shared with 'aess' hwmod, thus both hwmods must also specify which
bits of the register are used for them.

This patch only adds the hwmod data, but a future patch should add
code support such that only the specified bits are read and cleared by
the context lose counter update code. If a hwmod doesn't specify
'lostcontext_mask' (default behavior), the whole contents of the
context register should be used without any filtering.
