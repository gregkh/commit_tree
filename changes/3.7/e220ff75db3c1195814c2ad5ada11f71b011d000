staging: ccg: include all sourced files

This Android gadget includes a bunch of .c files. Fixing normal gadgets
is not the real problem but this gadget is not always fixable since the
problem here are fundumential / design.

*I* wanted to get this removed but other people want to keep it even
though there were reports that Android itself is not using it. Some
poeple think that it is better to have this instead of nothing and other
argue that they need sdb and mass storage gadget. The sdb function is
not provided by ccg so I don't see the point of this. I don't see any
logical reasoning behind it and I decided that it is time for retreat.

This patch brings all dependencies of ccg into staging so I can do
whatever I want in drivers/usb/gadget without breaking ccg.
