Input: fix use-after-free introduced with dynamic minor changes

Commit 7f8d4cad1e4e ("Input: extend the number of event (and other)
devices") made evdev, joydev and mousedev to embed struct cdev into
their respective structures representing input devices.

Unfortunately character device structure may outlive the parent
structure unless we do not set it up as parent of character device so
that it will stay pinned until character device is freed.

Also, now that parent structure is pinned while character device exists
we do not need to pin and unpin it every time user opens or closes it.
