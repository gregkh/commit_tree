tpm: fix double write race and tpm_release free issue

Moved the atomic_set of the data_pending variable until after the
tpm_read has completed processing. The existing code had a window of
time where a second write to the driver could clobber the tpm command
buffer.

Also fixed an issue where if close was called on the tpm device before a
read completed, the tpm command buffer would be returned to the OS,
which could contain sensitive information.
