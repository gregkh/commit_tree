Subject: [PATCH] dup3: Return an error when oldfd == newfd.

The following commit:

  commit fe17f22d7fd0e344ef6447238f799bb49f670c6f
  Author: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

    take purely descriptor-related stuff from fcntl.c to file.c

was supposed to be just code motion, but it dropped the following two
lines:

  if (unlikely(oldfd == newfd))
          return -EINVAL;

from the dup3 system call.  dup3 is not specified by POSIX, so Linux
can do what it likes.  However the POSIX proposal for dup3 [1] states
that it should return an error if oldfd == newfd.
