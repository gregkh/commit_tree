[SCSI] bfa: Firmware image naming convention update

- Modified the firmware naming convention to contain the
  firmware image version (3.1.0.0).
- The new convention is <firmware-image>-<firmware-version>.bin
- The change will enforce loading only compatible firmware with this driver
  and also avoid over-writing the old firmware image in-order to load new
  version driver as the firmware names used to be the same.
