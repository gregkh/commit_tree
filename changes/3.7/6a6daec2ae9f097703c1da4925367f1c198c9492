perf script: Add general python handler to process non-tracepoint events

This patch just follows Robert Richter's idea and the commit 37a058ea0
	"perf script: Add generic perl handler to process events"
to similarly add a python handler for general events other than tracepoints.

For non-tracepoint events, this patch will try to find a function named
"process_event" in the python script, and pass the event attribute,
perf_sample, raw_data in format of raw string. And the python script can
use "struct" module's unpack function to disasemble the needed info and process.
