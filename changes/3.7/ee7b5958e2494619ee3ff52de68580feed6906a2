xen: arm: make p2m operations NOPs

This makes common code less ifdef-y and is consistent with PVHVM on
x86.

Also note that phys_to_machine_mapping_valid should take a pfn
argument and make it do so.

Add __set_phys_to_machine, make set_phys_to_machine a simple wrapper
(on systems with non-nop implementations the outer one can allocate
new p2m pages).

Make __set_phys_to_machine check for identity mapping or invalid only.
