xtensa: reset windowbase/windowstart when cloning the VM

When we copy a user thread with CLONE_VM, we also have to reset
windowbase and windowstart to start a pristine stack frame. Otherwise,
overflows can happen using the address 0 as the stack pointer.
Also add a special case for vfork, which continues on the
parent stack until it calls execve. Because this could be a call8, we
need to spill the stack pointer of the previus frame (if still 'live' in
the register file).
