ASoC: omap-abe-twl6040: Add device tree support

When the board boots with device tree the driver will receive the name of the
card, DAPM routing map, phandle for the audio components described in the dts
file, mclk speed, and the possibility of detecting the jack detection.

The card will be set up based on this information.
Since the routing is provided via DT we can mark the card fully routed so
core can take care of disconnecting the unused pins.
