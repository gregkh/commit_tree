powerpc: Remove tlb batching hack for nighthawk

In hpte_init_native() we call tlb_batching_enabled() to decide if we
should setup ppc_md.flush_hash_range.

tlb_batching_enabled() checks the _unflattened_ device tree, to see
if we are running on a nighthawk.

Since commit a223535 ("dont allow pSeries_probe to succeed without
initialising MMU", Dec 2006), hpte_init_native() has been called from
pSeries_probe() - at which point we have not yet unflattened the
device tree.

This means tlb_batching_enabled() will always return true, so the hack
has effectively been disabled since Dec 2006. Ergo, I think we can
drop it.
