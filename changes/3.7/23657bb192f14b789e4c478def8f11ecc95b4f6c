workqueue: add missing wmb() in clear_work_data()

Any operation which clears PENDING should be preceded by a wmb to
guarantee that the next PENDING owner sees all the changes made before
PENDING release.

There are only two places where PENDING is cleared -
set_work_cpu_and_clear_pending() and clear_work_data().  The caller of
the former already does smp_wmb() but the latter doesn't have any.

Move the wmb above set_work_cpu_and_clear_pending() into it and add
one to clear_work_data().

There hasn't been any report related to this issue, and, given how
clear_work_data() is used, it is extremely unlikely to have caused any
actual problems on any architecture.
