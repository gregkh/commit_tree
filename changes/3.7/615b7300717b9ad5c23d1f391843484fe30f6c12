acpi-cpufreq: Add support for disabling dynamic overclocking

One feature present in powernow-k8 that isn't present in acpi-cpufreq
is support for enabling or disabling AMD's core performance boost
technology. This patch adds support to acpi-cpufreq, but also
includes support for Intel's dynamic acceleration.

The original boost disabling sysfs file was per CPU, but acted
globally. Also the naming (cpb) was at least not intuitive.
So lets introduce a single file simply called "boost", which sits
once in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq.
This should be the only way of using this feature, so add
documentation about the rationale and the usage.

A following patch will re-introduce the cpb knob for compatibility
reasons on AMD CPUs.

Per-CPU boost switching is possible, but not trivial and is thus
postponed to a later patch series.
