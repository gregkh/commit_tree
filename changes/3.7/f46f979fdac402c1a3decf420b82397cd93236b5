arm64: perf: use architected event for CPU cycle counter

We currently use a fake event encoding (0xFF) to indicate CPU cycles so
that we don't waste an event counter and can target the hardware cycle
counter instead.

The problem with this approach is that the event space defined by the
architecture permits an implementation to allocate 0xFF for some other
event.

This patch uses the architected cycle counter encoding (0x11) so that
we avoid potentially clashing with event encodings on future CPU
implementations.
