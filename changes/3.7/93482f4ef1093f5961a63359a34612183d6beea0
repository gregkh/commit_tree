ia64: Add missing RCU idle APIs on idle loop

Traditionally, the entire idle task served as an RCU quiescent state.
But when RCU read side critical sections started appearing within the
idle loop, this traditional strategy became untenable.  The fix was to
create new RCU APIs named rcu_idle_enter() and rcu_idle_exit(), which
must be called by each architecture's idle loop so that RCU can tell
when it is safe to ignore a given idle CPU.

Unfortunately, this fix was never applied to ia64, a shortcoming remedied
by this commit.
