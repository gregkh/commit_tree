    af_packet: don't emit packet on orig fanout group

This buggy patch was a feature fix and has reached most stable
branches.

When skb->sk is NULL and when packet fanout is used, there is a
crash in match_fanout_group where skb->sk is accessed.
This patch fixes the issue by returning false as soon as the
socket is NULL: this correspond to the wanted behavior because
the kernel as to resend the skb to all the listening socket in
this case.
