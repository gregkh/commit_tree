Input: extend the number of event (and other) devices

Extend the amount of character devices, such as eventX, mouseX and jsX,
from a hard limit of 32 per input handler to about 1024 shared across
all handlers.

To be compatible with legacy installations input handlers will start
creating char devices with minors in their legacy range, however once
legacy range is exhausted they will start allocating minors from the
dynamic range 256-1024.
