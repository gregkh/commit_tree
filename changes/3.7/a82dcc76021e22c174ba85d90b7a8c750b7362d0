rcu: Make offline-CPU checking allow for indefinite delays

The rcu_implicit_offline_qs() function implicitly assumed that execution
would progress predictably when interrupts are disabled, which is of course
not guaranteed when running on a hypervisor.  Furthermore, this function
is short, and is called from one place only in a short function.

This commit therefore ensures that the timing is checked before
checking the condition, which guarantees correct behavior even given
indefinite delays.  It also inlines rcu_implicit_offline_qs() into
rcu_implicit_dynticks_qs().
