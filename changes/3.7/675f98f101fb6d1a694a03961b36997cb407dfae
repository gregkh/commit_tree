staging: comedi: s526: remove struct s526GPCTConfig

The enum in this struct is used by the driver to know how the
gpct channels have been configured. Instead of using the private
enum S526_GPCT_APP_CLASS, we can just use the INSN_CONFIG_* value
that was passed in data[0] to the s526_gpct_insn_config().

The data array in this struct in never used. It actually could
cause a BUG since it assumes that the data pointer passed to
s526_gpct_insn_config() always has 6 values but the comments
indicate that there are really only 4 or 5.

Remove the s526GPCTConfig struct and associated S526_GPCT_APP_CLASS
enum and just use and unsigned int array in the private data to
hold the gpct configuration.
