HID: Remove duplicate ID for QUANTA 3001 touchscreen

For some reason, we had two IDs for the QUANTA 3001 touchscreen controller,
one USB_DEVICE_ID_QUANTA_OPTICAL_TOUCH_3001 and one
USB_DEVICE_ID_PIXART_IMAGING_INC_OPTICAL_TOUCH_SCREEN. As this has caused
confusion, remove USB_DEVICE_ID_PIXART_IMAGING_INC_OPTICAL_TOUCH_SCREEN
completely, and fix places where it was used to refer to
USB_DEVICE_ID_QUANTA_OPTICAL_TOUCH_3001.
