ext4: fix fdatasync() for files with only i_size changes

Code tracking when transaction needs to be committed on fdatasync(2) forgets
to handle a situation when only inode's i_size is changed. Thus in such
situations fdatasync(2) doesn't force transaction with new i_size to disk
and that can result in wrong i_size after a crash.

Fix the issue by updating inode's i_datasync_tid whenever its size is
updated.
