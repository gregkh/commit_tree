rcu: Allow RCU quiescent-state forcing to be preempted

RCU quiescent-state forcing is currently carried out without preemption
points, which can result in excessive latency spikes on large systems
(many hundreds or thousands of CPUs).  This patch therefore inserts
a voluntary preemption point into force_qs_rnp(), which should greatly
reduce the magnitude of these spikes.
