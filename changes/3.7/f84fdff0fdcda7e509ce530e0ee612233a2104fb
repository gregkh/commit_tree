driver: add PPI support in tpm driver

The Physical Presence Interface enables the OS and the BIOS to cooperate and
provides a simple and straightforward platform user experience for
administering the TPM without sacrificing security.

V2: separate the patch out in a separate source file,
    add #ifdef CONFIG_ACPI so it compiles out on ppc,
    use standard error instead of ACPI error as return code of show/store fns.
V3: move #ifdef CONFIG_ACPI from .c file to .h file.
V4: move tpm_ppi code from tpm module to tpm_bios module.
V5: modify sys_add_ppi() so that ppi_attr_grp doesn't need to be exported
