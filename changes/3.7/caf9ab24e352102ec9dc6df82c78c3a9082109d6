drm/i915/dp: Be smarter about connection sense for branch devices

If there's no downstream device, DPCD success is good enough.  If
there's a hotplug-capable downstream device, count the number of
connected sinks in DP_SINK_STATUS and return success if it's non-zero.
Otherwise, probe DDC and report appropriately.

v2: Check DP_SINK_STATUS instead of something unrelated to sink status.
