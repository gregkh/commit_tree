md: writing to sync_action should clear the read-auto state.

In some cases array are started in 'read-auto' state where in
nothing gets written to any device until the array is written
to.  The purpose of this is to make accidental auto-assembly
of the wrong arrays less of a risk, and to allow arrays to be
started to read suspend-to-disk images without actually changing
anything (as might happen if the array were dirty and a
resync seemed necessary).

Explicitly writing the 'sync_action' for a read-auto array currently
doesn't clear the read-auto state, so the sync action doesn't
happen, which can be confusing.

So allow any successful write to sync_action to clear any read-auto
state.
