staging: comedi: dnya_pci10xx: move boardinfo values into subdevice setup

There is only one "boardtype" actually supported by this driver.
The second entry in the boardinfo is a dummy entry that would
result in an unusable device.

Remove the boardinfo fields and just use the open coded values
in the subdevice setup.
