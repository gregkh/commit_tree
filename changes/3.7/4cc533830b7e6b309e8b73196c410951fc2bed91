wlcore: Prevent interaction with HW after recovery is queued

When a function requests to recover, it would normally abort and will
not send any additional commands to the HW. However, other threads may
not be aware of the failure and could try to communicate with the HW
after a recovery was queued, but before the recovery work began.

Fix this by introducing an intermediate state which is set when recovery
is queued, and modify all state checks accordingly.
