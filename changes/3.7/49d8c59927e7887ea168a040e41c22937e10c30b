regulator: Fairchild fan53555 support

This driver supports Fairchild FAN53555 Digitally Programmable
TinyBuck Regulator. The FAN53555 is a step-down switching voltage
regulator that delivers a digitally programmable output from an
input voltage supply of 2.5V to 5.5V. The output voltage is
programmed through an I2C interface.
