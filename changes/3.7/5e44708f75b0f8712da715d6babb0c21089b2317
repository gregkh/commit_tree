n_gsm: added interlocking for gsm_data_lock for certain code paths

There were some locking holes in the management of the MUX's
message queue for 2 code paths:
1) gsmld_write_wakeup
2) receipt of CMD_FCON flow-control message
In both cases gsm_data_kick is called w/o locking so it can collide
with other other instances of gsm_data_kick (pulling messages tx_tail)
or potentially other instances of __gsm_data_queu (adding messages to tx_head)

Changed to take the tx_lock in these 2 cases
