inet_diag: validate byte code to prevent oops in inet_diag_bc_run()

Add logic to validate INET_DIAG_BC_S_COND and INET_DIAG_BC_D_COND
operations.

Previously we did not validate the inet_diag_hostcond, address family,
address length, and prefix length. So a malicious user could make the
kernel read beyond the end of the bytecode array by claiming to have a
whole inet_diag_hostcond when the bytecode was not long enough to
contain a whole inet_diag_hostcond of the given address family. Or
they could make the kernel read up to about 27 bytes beyond the end of
a connection address by passing a prefix length that exceeded the
length of addresses of the given family.
