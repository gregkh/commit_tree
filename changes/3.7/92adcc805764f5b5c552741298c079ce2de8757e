staging: slicoss: remove default case after we done with request_firmware

we are returning -ENOENT when there is no firmware file for a matching
device id. then we start calling request_firmware,
after this we do checks on the firmware length of corresponding
device id, since the default case is handled in the begining itself
there is no need of a default case at the firmware length checks
