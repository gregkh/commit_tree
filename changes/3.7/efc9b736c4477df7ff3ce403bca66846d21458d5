mmc/omap_hsmmc: add a const qualifier

This prepares *of_device_id.data becoming const. Without this change
the following warning would occur:

	drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.c: In function 'omap_hsmmc_probe':
	drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.c:1808: warning: initialization discards qualifiers from pointer target type
