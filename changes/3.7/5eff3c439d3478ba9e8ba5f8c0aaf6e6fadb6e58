md: make sure everything is freed when dm-raid stops an array.

md_stop() would stop an array, but not free various attached
data structures.
For internal arrays, these are freed later in do_md_stop() or
mddev_put(), but they don't apply for dm-raid arrays.
So get md_stop() to free them, and only all it from dm-raid.
For internal arrays we now call __md_stop.
