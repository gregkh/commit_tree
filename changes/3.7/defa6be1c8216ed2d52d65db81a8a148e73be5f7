mfd: Fix compile for twl-core.c by removing cpu_is_omap usage

Commit 7d7e1eba (ARM: OMAP2+: Prepare for irqs.h removal) broke
compile for non-omap as include plat/cpu.h was added. This header
was indirectly included earlier when SPARSE_IRQ was not set, but
does not exist on most platforms.

Fix the problem by removing the cpu_is_omap usage that should
not exist in drivers at all. We can do this by adding proper
clock aliases for the twl-core.c drivers, and drop separate
handling for cases when clock framework is not available as
the behaviour will stay the same.

Note that we need to add a platform device to avoid using the
i2c provided names that may be different on various omaps.
