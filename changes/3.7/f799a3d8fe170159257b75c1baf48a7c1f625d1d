Input: omap-keypad: Remove dependencies to mach includes

Remove support for omap2+ as it's no longer needed since
it's using matrix-keypad. This way we can remove depency
to plat and mach headers which is needed for ARM common
zImage support.

Also remove INT_KEYBOARD by using omap_kp->irq.

Note that this patch depends on an earlier patch
"ARM: OMAP: Move gpio.h to include/linux/platform_data".
