s390/sysinfo: convert /proc/sysinfo to seqfile

The current proc implementation of the /proc/sysinfo file writes all
informations contained in all system information blocks to a single
page.
This is done by calling sprintf all the time in the expectation that
everything will fit into a single page. This however is not necessarily
true if the configuration of a machine is very large.
So convert /proc/sysinfo to avoid writing into random memory regions.

For readability reasons a couple of lines are longer than 80 characters.
