ALSA: hda - Yet another fix for D3 stop-clock refcounting

The call of pm_notify callback in snd_hda_codec_free() should be with
the check of the current state whether pm_notify(false) is called or
not, instead of codec->power_on check.

For improving the code readability and fixing this inconsistency,
codec->d3_stop_clk_ok is renamed to codec->pm_down_notified, and this
flag is set only when runtime PM down is called.  The new name reflects
to a more direct purpose of the flag.
