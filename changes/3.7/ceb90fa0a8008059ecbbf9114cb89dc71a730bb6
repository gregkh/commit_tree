xen/privcmd: add PRIVCMD_MMAPBATCH_V2 ioctl

PRIVCMD_MMAPBATCH_V2 extends PRIVCMD_MMAPBATCH with an additional
field for reporting the error code for every frame that could not be
mapped.  libxc prefers PRIVCMD_MMAPBATCH_V2 over PRIVCMD_MMAPBATCH.

Also expand PRIVCMD_MMAPBATCH to return appropriate error-encoding top nibble
in the mfn array.
