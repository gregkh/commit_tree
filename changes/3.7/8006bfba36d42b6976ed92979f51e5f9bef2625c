NFSv4.1: Get rid of the NFS_LAYOUT_DESTROYED state

We already have a mechanism for blocking LAYOUTGET by means of the
plh_block_lgets counter. The only "service" that NFS_LAYOUT_DESTROYED
provides at this point is to block layoutget once the layout segment
list is empty, which basically means that you have to wait until
the pnfs_layout_hdr is destroyed before you can do pNFS on that file
again.

This patch enables the reuse of the pnfs_layout_hdr if the layout
segment list is empty.
