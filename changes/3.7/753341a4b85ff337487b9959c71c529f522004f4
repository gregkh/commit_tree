revert "mm: have order > 0 compaction start off where it left"

This reverts commit 7db8889ab05b ("mm: have order > 0 compaction start
off where it left") and commit de74f1cc ("mm: have order > 0 compaction
start near a pageblock with free pages").  These patches were a good
idea and tests confirmed that they massively reduced the amount of
scanning but the implementation is complex and tricky to understand.  A
later patch will cache what pageblocks should be skipped and
reimplements the concept of compact_cached_free_pfn on top for both
migration and free scanners.
