workqueue: reorganize try_to_grab_pending() and __cancel_timer_work()

* Use bool @is_dwork instead of @timer and let try_to_grab_pending()
  use to_delayed_work() to determine the delayed_work address.

* Move timer handling from __cancel_work_timer() to
  try_to_grab_pending().

* Make try_to_grab_pending() use -EAGAIN instead of -1 for
  busy-looping and drop the ret local variable.

* Add proper function comment to try_to_grab_pending().

This makes the code a bit easier to understand and will ease further
changes.  This patch doesn't make any functional change.

v2: Use @is_dwork instead of @timer.
