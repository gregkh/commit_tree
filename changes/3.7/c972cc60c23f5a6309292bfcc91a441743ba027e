s390/vmalloc: have separate modules area

Add a special module area on top of the vmalloc area, which may be only
used for modules and bpf jit generated code.
This makes sure that inter module branches will always happen without a
trampoline and in addition having all the code within a 2GB frame is
branch prediction unit friendly.
