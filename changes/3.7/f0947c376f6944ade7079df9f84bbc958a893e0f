drm/i915: Add interfaces to read out encoder/connector hw state

It is all glorious if we try really hard to only enable/disable an
entire display pipe to ensure that everyting happens in the right
order. But if we don't know the output configuration when the driver
takes over, this will all be for vain because we'll make the hw angry
right on the first modeset - we don't know what outputs/ports are
enabled and hence have to disable everything in a rather ad-hoc way.

Hence we need to be able to read out the current hw state, so that we
can properly tear down the current hw state on the first modeset.
Obviously this is also a nice preparation for the fastboot work, where
we try to avoid the modeset on driver load if it matches what the hw
is currently using.

Furthermore we'll be using these functions to cross-check the actual
hw state with what we think it should be, to ensure that the modeset
state machine actually works as advertised.

This patch only contains the interface definitions and a little helper
for the simple case where we have a 1:1 encoder to connector mapping.
