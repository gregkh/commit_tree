mm: bugfix: set current->reclaim_state to NULL while returning from kswapd()

In kswapd(), set current->reclaim_state to NULL before returning, as
current->reclaim_state holds reference to variable on kswapd()'s stack.

In rare cases, while returning from kswapd() during memory offlining,
__free_slab() and freepages() can access the dangling pointer of
current->reclaim_state.
