ALSA: usb-audio: Move configuration to prepare.

Move interface and endpoint configuration from hw_params to prepare
callback.  During system suspend/resume when the USB device power isn't
cycled the interface and endpoint configuration need to be set before
audio playback can continue.  Resume involves another call to prepare
but not to hw_params, moving it here allows a playing stream to continue
after resume.
