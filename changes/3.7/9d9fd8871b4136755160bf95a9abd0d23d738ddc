powerpc/mpc52xx_lpbfifo: optionally defer fifo transfer start

Currently fifo transfer is started when submitting a transfer
request. Add posibility to defer the fifo transfer and start it
later by calling additional function. This change is backward
compatible, the behaviour of mpc52xx_lpbfifo_submit() is the same
for previous driver users, so there is no need to adapt them.
