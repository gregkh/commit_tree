tpm: Move tpm_get_random api into the TPM device driver

Move the tpm_get_random api from the trusted keys code into the TPM
device driver itself so that other callers can make use of it. Also,
change the api slightly so that the number of bytes read is returned in
the call, since the TPM command can potentially return fewer bytes than
requested.
