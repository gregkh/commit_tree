Btrfs: fix punch hole when no extent exists

I saw the warning in btrfs_drop_extent_cache where our end is less than our
start while running xfstests 68 in a loop.  This is because we
unconditionally do drop_end = min(end, extent_end) in
__btrfs_drop_extents(), even though we may not have found an extent in the
range we were looking to drop.  So keep track of wether or not we found
something, and if we didn't just use our end.  Thanks,
