rbtree: reference Documentation/rbtree.txt for usage instructions

I recently started looking at the rbtree code (with an eye towards
improving the augmented rbtree support, but I haven't gotten there yet).
I noticed a lot of possible speed improvements, which I am now proposing
in this patch set.

Patches 1-4 are preparatory: remove internal functions from rbtree.h so
that users won't be tempted to use them instead of the documented APIs,
clean up some incorrect usages I've noticed (in particular, with the
recently added fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c rbtree usage), reference the
documentation so that people have one less excuse to miss it, etc.

Patch 5 is a small module I wrote to check the rbtree performance.  It
creates 100 nodes with random keys and repeatedly inserts and erases them
from an rbtree.  Additionally, it has code to check for rbtree invariants
after each insert or erase operation.

Patches 6-12 is where the rbtree optimizations are done, and they touch
only that one file, lib/rbtree.c .  I am getting good results out of these
- in my small benchmark doing rbtree insertion (including search) and
erase, I'm seeing a 30% runtime reduction on Sandybridge E5, which is more
than I initially thought would be possible.  (the results aren't as
impressive on my two other test hosts though, AMD barcelona and Intel
Westmere, where I am seeing 14% runtime reduction only).  The code size -
both source (ommiting comments) and compiled - is also shorter after these
changes.  However, I do admit that the updated code is more arduous to
read - one big reason for that is the removal of the tree rotation
helpers, which added some overhead but also made it easier to reason about
things locally.  Overall, I believe this is an acceptable compromise,
given that this code doesn't get modified very often, and that I have good
tests for it.

Upon Peter's suggestion, I added comments showing the rtree configuration
before every rotation.  I think they help; however it's still best to have
a copy of the cormen/leiserson/rivest book when digging into this code.

This patch: reference Documentation/rbtree.txt for usage instructions

include/linux/rbtree.h included some basic usage instructions, while
Documentation/rbtree.txt had some more complete and easier to follow
instructions.  Replacing the former with a reference to the latter.
