mm: mmu_notifier: have mmu_notifiers use a global SRCU so they may safely schedule

With an RCU based mmu_notifier implementation, any callout to
mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_{start,end}() or
mmu_notifier_invalidate_page() would not be allowed to call schedule()
as that could potentially allow a modification to the mmu_notifier
structure while it is currently being used.

Since srcu allocs 4 machine words per instance per cpu, we may end up
with memory exhaustion if we use srcu per mm.  So all mms share a global
srcu.  Note that during large mmu_notifier activity exit & unregister
paths might hang for longer periods, but it is tolerable for current
mmu_notifier clients.
