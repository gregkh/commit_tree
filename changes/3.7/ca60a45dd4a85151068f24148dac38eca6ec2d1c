[media] xc5000: show debug version fields in decimal instead of hex

The driver prints out a dotted version number but it's in hex.  As a
result, the version doesn't visibly match the filename for the firmware,
and it caused a bunch of confusion while discussing different versions
with the chip manufacturer.

Change the firmware printout to be in decimal.
