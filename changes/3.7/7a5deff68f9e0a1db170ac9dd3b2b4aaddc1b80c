ARM: LPC32xx: Remove board specific GPIO init

This patch removes a board specific GPIO initialization (for MMC power) from
the platform initialization. On the reference boards (PHY3250 and EA3250), this
separate initialization is not necessary, now reducing board specific
initialization in the platform init of phy3250.c.
