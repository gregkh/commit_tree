ALSA: remove the main version information

Remove the main ALSA version number from the kernel ALSA driver.
The ALSA driver package release diverges from the upstream. This may
confuse users to see the same ALSA version for many kernel releases
and this version lost it's original purpose and connection.

The "ioctl" APIs have own version numbers, so the user space may check
for specific API changes only.
