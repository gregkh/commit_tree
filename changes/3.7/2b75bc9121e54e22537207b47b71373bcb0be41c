dlm: check the maximum size of a request from user

device_write only checks whether the request size is big enough, but it doesn't
check if the size is too big.

At that point, it also tries to allocate as much memory as the user has requested
even if it's too much. This can lead to OOM killer kicking in, or memory corruption
if (count + 1) overflows.
