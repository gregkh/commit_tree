rbd: read the header before registering device

Read the rbd header information and call rbd_dev_set_mapping()
earlier--before registering the block device or setting up the sysfs
entries for the image.  The sysfs entries provide users access to
some information that's only available after doing the rbd header
initialization, so this will make sure it's valid right away.
