ftrace: Pass ftrace_ops as third parameter to function trace callback

Currently the function trace callback receives only the ip and parent_ip
of the function that it traced. It would be more powerful to also return
the ops that registered the function as well. This allows the same function
to act differently depending on what ftrace_ops registered it.
