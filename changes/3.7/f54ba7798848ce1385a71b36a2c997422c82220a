pkt_sched: Fix warning false positives.

GCC refuses to recognize that all error control flows do in fact
set err to something.

Add an explicit initialization to shut it up.

net/sched/sch_drr.c: In function ‘drr_enqueue’:
net/sched/sch_drr.c:359:11: warning: ‘err’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
net/sched/sch_qfq.c: In function ‘qfq_enqueue’:
net/sched/sch_qfq.c:885:11: warning: ‘err’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
