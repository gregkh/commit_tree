ARM: bcm2835: add system timer

The System Timer peripheral provides four 32-bit timer channels and a
single 64-bit free running counter. Each channel has an output compare
register, which is compared against the 32 least significant bits of the
free running counter values, and generates an interrupt.

Timer 3 is used as the Linux timer.

The BCM2835 also contains an SP804-based timer module. However, it
apparently has significant differences from the standard SP804 IP block,
and Broadcom's documentation recommends using the system timer instead.

This patch was extracted from git://github.com/lp0/linux.git branch
rpi-split as of 2012/09/08, and modified as follows:

* s/bcm2708/bcm2835/.
* Modified device tree vendor prefix.
* Moved to drivers/clocksource/. This looks like the desired location for
  such code now.
* Added DT binding docs.
* Moved struct sys_timer bcm2835_timer into time.c to encapsulate it more.
* Simplified bcm2835_time_init() to find one matching node and operate on
  it, rather than looping over all matching nodes. This seems more
  consistent with other clocksource code.
* Simplified bcm2835_time_init() using of_iomap().
* Renamed struct bcm2835_timer.index to match_mask to better represent its
  purpose.
* s/printk(PR_INFO/pr_info(/
