ARM: pxa: remove sharpsl_fatal_check function

The sharpsl_fatal_check has not been used since Pavel Machek removed
the caller in 99f329a2b "pxa/sharpsl_pm: zaurus c3000 aka spitz: fix
resume". Nobody has complained since 2009, so it's safe to assume we
can just remove the function.

Without this patch, building corgi_defconfig results in:

/home/arnd/linux-arm/arch/arm/mach-pxa/sharpsl_pm.c:693:12: warning: 'sharpsl_fatal_check' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
