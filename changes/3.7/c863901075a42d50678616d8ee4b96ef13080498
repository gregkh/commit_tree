KVM: x86: Fix guest debug across vcpu INIT reset

If we reset a vcpu on INIT, we so far overwrote dr7 as provided by
KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG, and we also cleared switch_db_regs unconditionally.

Fix this by saving the dr7 used for guest debugging and calculating the
effective register value as well as switch_db_regs on any potential
change. This will change to focus of the set_guest_debug vendor op to
update_dp_bp_intercept.

Found while trying to stop on start_secondary.
