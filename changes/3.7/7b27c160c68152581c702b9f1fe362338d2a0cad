pwm: i.MX: fix clock lookup

The i.MX PWM core has two clocks: The ipg clock and the ipg highfreq
(peripheral) clock. The ipg clock has to be enabled for this hardware
to work. The actual PWM output can either be driven by the ipg clock
or the ipg highfreq. The ipg highfreq has the advantage that it runs
even when the SoC is in low power modes.
This patch requests both clocks and enables the ipg clock for accessing
registers and the peripheral clock to actually turn on the PWM.
