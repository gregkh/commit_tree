ALSA: hda - fix control names for multiple speaker out on IDT/STAC

For multiple speaker outs, the names were previously
"Speaker,0", "Speaker,1", "Center"/"LFE", "Speaker,3". This is
inconsistent, confusing, and is not picked up correctly by PulseAudio.
Instead use "Front", "Surround", "Center"/"LFE", "Side" which
is more standard.
