drm/udl: Add missing static storage class specifiers in udl_fb.c

Fixes the following sparse warnings:
drivers/gpu/drm/udl/udl_fb.c:360:6: warning:
symbol 'udl_crtc_fb_gamma_set' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/gpu/drm/udl/udl_fb.c:365:6: warning:
symbol 'udl_crtc_fb_gamma_get' was not declared. Should it be static?
