ARM: msm: Allow timer.c to compile on multiple targets

The timer code relies on #defines from mach/iomap.h, cpu_is_*()
checks, and a global irq #define. All this makes this file
impossible to compile in a mult-target build. Therefore, make a
sys_timer struct for each SoC so that machine descriptors can
reference the correct timer. Then go through and replace all the
defines with raw values that are passed to a common
initialization function.

This paves the way to adding DT support to this code as well as
allows us to compile this file on multiple targets at the same
time.
