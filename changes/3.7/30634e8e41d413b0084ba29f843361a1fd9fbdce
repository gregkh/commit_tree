[media] sliced vbi: subdevs shouldn't clear the full v4l2_sliced_vbi_format struct

Various subdevs cleared the full v4l2_sliced_vbi_format struct, when
only the service_set/lines fields should have been cleared.
Due to this the io_size field was wrongly cleared to 0, causing a
v4l2-compliance error.
