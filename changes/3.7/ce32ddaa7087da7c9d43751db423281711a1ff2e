ARM: tegra: cpu-tegra: explicitly manage re-parenting

When changing a PLL's rate, it must have no active children. The CPU
clock cannot be stopped, and CPU clock's divider is not used. The old
clock driver used to handle this by internally reparenting the CPU clock
onto a different PLL when changing the CPU clock rate. However, the new
common-clock based clock driver does not do this, and probably cannot do
this due to the locking issues it would cause.

To solve this, have the Tegra cpufreq driver explicitly perform the
reparenting operations itself. This is probably reasonable anyway,
since such reparenting is somewhat a matter of policy (e.g. which
alternate clock source to use, whether to leave the CPU clock a child
of the alternate clock source if it's running at the desired rate),
and hence is something more appropriate for the cpufreq driver than
the core clock driver anyway.
