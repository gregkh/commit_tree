drm: edid: add support for E-DDC

The current logic for probing ddc is limited to
2 blocks (256 bytes), this patch adds support
for the 4 block (512) data.

To do this, a single 8-bit segment index is
passed to the display via the I2C address 30h.
Data from the selected segment is then immediately
read via the regular DDC2 address using a repeated
I2C 'START' signal.
