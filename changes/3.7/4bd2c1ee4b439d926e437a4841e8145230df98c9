memcg: cleanup kmem tcp ifdefs

TCP kmem accounting is currently guarded by CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM ifdefs but
the code is not used if !CONFIG_INET so we should rather test for both.
The same applies to net/sock.h, net/ip.h and net/tcp_memcontrol.h but
let's keep those outside of any ifdefs because it is considered safer wrt.
 future maintainability.

Tested with
- CONFIG_INET && CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM
- !CONFIG_INET && CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM
- CONFIG_INET && !CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM
- !CONFIG_INET && !CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM
