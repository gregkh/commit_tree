xtensa: allow multi-inclusion for uapi/unistd.h

Xtensa implements a method that allows to generate a arbitrary output
for each system call by defining the __SYSCALL(number, function, num_args).
This usually requires to include uapi/unistd.h twice. Instead of removing
the guard agains multiple inclusion entirely, allow to include unistd.h again
only if __SYSCALL is defined. Note that __SYSCALL gets always undefined at
the end of the file.
