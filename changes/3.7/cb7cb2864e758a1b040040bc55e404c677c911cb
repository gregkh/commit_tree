x86, kvm: Remove incorrect redundant assembly constraint

In __emulate_1op_rax_rdx, we use "+a" and "+d" which are input/output
constraints, and *then* use "a" and "d" as input constraints.  This is
incorrect, but happens to work on some versions of gcc.

However, it breaks gcc with -O0 and icc, and may break on future
versions of gcc.
