powerpc/eeh: Move EEH initialization around

Currently, we have 3 phases for EEH initialization on pSeries platform.
All of them are done through builtin functions: platform initialization,
EEH device creation, and EEH subsystem enablement. All of them are done
no later than ppc_md.setup_arch. That means that the slab/slub isn't ready
yet, so we have to allocate memory chunks on basis of PAGE_SIZE for those
dynamically created EEH devices. That's pretty expensive.

In order to utilize slab/slub for memory allocation, we have to move the EEH
initialization functions around, but all of them should be called after slab
is ready.
