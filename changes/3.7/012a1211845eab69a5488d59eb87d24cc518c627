viafb: don't touch clock state on OLPC XO-1.5

As detailed in the thread titled "viafb PLL/clock tweaking causes XO-1.5
instability," enabling or disabling the IGA1/IGA2 clocks causes occasional
stability problems during suspend/resume cycles on this platform.

This is rather odd, as the documentation suggests that clocks have two
states (on/off) and the default (stable) configuration is configured to
enable the clock only when it is needed. However, explicitly enabling *or*
disabling the clock triggers this system instability, suggesting that there
is a 3rd state at play here.

Leaving the clock enable/disable registers alone solves this problem.
This fixes spurious reboots during suspend/resume behaviour introduced by
commit b692a63a.
