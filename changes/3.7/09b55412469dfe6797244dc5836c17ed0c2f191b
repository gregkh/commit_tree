arm64: DMA mapping API

This patch adds support for the DMA mapping API. It uses dma_map_ops for
flexibility and it currently supports swiotlb. This patch could be
simplified further if the DMA accesses are coherent (not mandated by the
architecture) or if corresponding hooks are placed in the generic
swiotlb code to deal with cache maintenance.
