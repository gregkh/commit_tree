workqueue: use system_highpri_wq for highpri workers in rebind_workers()

In rebind_workers(), we do inserting a work to rebind to cpu for busy workers.
Currently, in this case, we use only system_wq. This makes a possible
error situation as there is mismatch between cwq->pool and worker->pool.

To prevent this, we should use system_highpri_wq for highpri worker
to match theses. This implements it.

tj: Rephrased comment a bit.
