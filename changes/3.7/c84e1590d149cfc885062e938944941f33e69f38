bonding: fix second off-by-one error

Fix off-by-one error because IFNAMSIZ == 16 and when this
code gets executed we stick a NULL byte where we should not.

How to reproduce:
 with CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR=y (otherwise it may pass by silently)
 modprobe bonding; echo 1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/mode;
 echo "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/active_slave;

Note: Sorry for the second patch but I missed this one while checking
      the file. You can squash them into one patch.
