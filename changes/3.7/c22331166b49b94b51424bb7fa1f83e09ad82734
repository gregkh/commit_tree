mm: avoid section mismatch warning for memblock_type_name

Following section mismatch warning is thrown during build;

    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x32408f): Section mismatch in reference from the function memblock_type_name() to the variable .meminit.data:memblock
    The function memblock_type_name() references
    the variable __meminitdata memblock.
    This is often because memblock_type_name lacks a __meminitdata
    annotation or the annotation of memblock is wrong.

This is because memblock_type_name makes reference to memblock variable
with attribute __meminitdata.  Hence, the warning (even if the function is
inline).
