ALSA: hda - force use of SSYNC bits

SSYNC bits are typically used to start multiple
streams synchronously. It makes sense to use them
for a single stream for a more predictable startup
sequence. The transfers only start once the DMA and
FIFOs are ready. This results in a better correlation
between timestamps and number of samples played.

Credits to Kar Leong Wang for suggesting this
improvement.
