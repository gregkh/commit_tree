KVM: Choose better candidate for directed yield

Currently, on a large vcpu guests, there is a high probability of
yielding to the same vcpu who had recently done a pause-loop exit or
cpu relax intercepted. Such a yield can lead to the vcpu spinning
again and hence degrade the performance.

The patchset keeps track of the pause loop exit/cpu relax interception
and gives chance to a vcpu which:
 (a) Has not done pause loop exit or cpu relax intercepted at all
     (probably he is preempted lock-holder)
 (b) Was skipped in last iteration because it did pause loop exit or
     cpu relax intercepted, and probably has become eligible now
     (next eligible lock holder)
