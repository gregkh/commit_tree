[SCSI] zfcp: Bounds checking for deferred error trace

The pl vector has scount elements, i.e. pl[scount-1] is the last valid
element. For maximum sized requests, payload->counter == scount after
the last loop iteration. Therefore, do bounds checking first (with
boolean shortcut) to not access the invalid element pl[scount].

Do not trust the maximum sbale->scount value from the HBA
but ensure we won't access the pl vector out of our allocated bounds.
While at it, clean up scoping and prevent unnecessary memset.
