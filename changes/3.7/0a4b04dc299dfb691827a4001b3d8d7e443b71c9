ARM: shmobile: use __iomem pointers for MMIO

ARM is moving to stricter checks on readl/write functions,
so we need to use the correct types everywhere.

This patch is a bit ugly for shmobile, which is the only platform
that just uses integer literals all over the place, but I can't
see a better way to do this.
