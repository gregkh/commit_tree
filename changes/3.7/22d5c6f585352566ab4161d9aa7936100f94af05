[media] xc5000: add support for firmware load check and init status

The xc5000c and newer versions of the xc5000a firmware need minor revisions
to their initialization process.  Add support for validating the firmware
was properly loaded, as well as checking the init status after initialization.

Based on advice from CrestaTech support as well as xc5000 datasheet v2.3.
