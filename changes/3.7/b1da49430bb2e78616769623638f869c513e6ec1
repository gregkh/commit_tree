staging: comedi: comedi_test: remove boardinfo

This boardinfo for this driver is unneccesary. This driver is only
for testing the comedi subsystem. It defines two dummy subdevices,
an 8 channel analog input subdevice and an 8 channel analog output
subdevice. There is no "board" associated with it.

Remove the boardinfo to keep the driver simple.
