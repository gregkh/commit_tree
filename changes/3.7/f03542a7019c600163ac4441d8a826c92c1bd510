sched: recover SD_WAKE_AFFINE in select_task_rq_fair and code clean up

Since power saving code was removed from sched now, the implement
code is out of service in this function, and even pollute other logical.
like, 'want_sd' never has chance to be set '0', that remove the effect
of SD_WAKE_AFFINE here.

So, clean up the obsolete code, includes SD_PREFER_LOCAL.
