autofs4 - fix reset pending flag on mount fail

In autofs4_d_automount(), if a mount fail occurs the AUTOFS_INF_PENDING
mount pending flag is not cleared.

One effect of this is when using the "browse" option, directory entry
attributes show up with all "?"s due to the incorrect callback and
subsequent failure return (when in fact no callback should be made).
