ALSA: hda - Fix recursive suspend/resume call

When the bus reset is performed during the suspend/resume (including
the power-saving too), it calls snd_hda_suspend() and
snd_hda_resume() again, and deadlocks eventually.

For avoiding the recursive call, add a new flag indicating that the PM
is being performed, and don't go to the bus reset mode when it's on.
