ext4: reimplement uninit extent optimization for move_extent_per_page()

Uninitialized extent may became initialized(parallel writeback task)
at any moment after we drop i_data_sem, so we have to recheck extent's
state after we hold page's lock and i_data_sem.

If we about to change page's mapping we must hold page's lock in order to
serialize other users.
