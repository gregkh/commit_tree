coredump: make core dump functionality optional

Adds an expert Kconfig option, CONFIG_COREDUMP, which allows disabling of
core dump.  This saves approximately 2.6k in the compiled kernel, and
complements CONFIG_ELF_CORE, which now depends on it.

CONFIG_COREDUMP also disables coredump-related sysctls, except for
suid_dumpable and related functions, which are necessary for ptrace.
