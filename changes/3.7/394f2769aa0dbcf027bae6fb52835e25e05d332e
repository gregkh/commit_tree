rcu: Prevent force_quiescent_state() memory contention

Large systems running RCU_FAST_NO_HZ kernels see extreme memory
contention on the rcu_state structure's ->fqslock field.  This
can be avoided by disabling RCU_FAST_NO_HZ, either at compile time
or at boot time (via the nohz kernel boot parameter), but large
systems will no doubt become sensitive to energy consumption.
This commit therefore uses a combining-tree approach to spread the
memory contention across new cache lines in the leaf rcu_node structures.
This can be thought of as a tournament lock that has only a try-lock
acquisition primitive.

The effect on small systems is minimal, because such systems have
an rcu_node "tree" consisting of a single node.  In addition, this
functionality is not used on fastpaths.
