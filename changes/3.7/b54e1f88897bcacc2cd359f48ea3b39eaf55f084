floppy: don't call alloc_ordered_workqueue inside the alloc_disk loop

Since commit 070ad7e ("floppy: convert to delayed work and single-thread
wq"), we end up calling alloc_ordered_workqueue multiple times inside
the loop, which shouldn't be intended. Besides the leak, other side
effect in the current code is if blk_init_queue fails, we would end up
calling unregister_blkdev even if we didn't call yet register_blkdev.

Just moved the allocation of floppy_wq before the loop, and adjusted the
code accordingly.
