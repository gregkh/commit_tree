ixgbe: Fix VF rate limiting to correctly account for more queues per VF

This change fixes the assumptions of the rate limiting code that previously
assumed that each VF would only ever have 2 queues.  This update makes it
so that we now use a queues per pool value that is determined based on the
VMDq feature mask.
