mfd: lpc_ich: Fix a 3.5 kernel regression for iTCO_wdt driver

There are many reports (including 2 of my machines) that iTCO_wdt watchdog
driver fails to be initialized in 3.5 kernel with error message like:

[    5.265175] ACPI Warning: 0x00001060-0x0000107f SystemIO conflicts with Region \_SB_.PCI0.LPCB.TCOI 1 (20120320/utaddress-251)
[    5.265192] ACPI: If an ACPI driver is available for this device, you should use it instead of the native driver
[    5.265206] lpc_ich: Resource conflict(s) found affecting iTCO_wdt

The root cause the iTCO_wdt driver in 3.4 probes the HW IO resource from
LPC's PCI config space, while in 3.5 kernel it relies on lpc_ich driver
for the probe, which adds a new acpi_check_resource_conflict() check, and
give up the probe if there is any conflict with ACPI.

Fix it by removing all the checks for iTCO_wdt to keep the same behavior as
3.4 kernel.

Actually the same check could be removed for the gpio-ich in lpc_ich.c,
but I'm not sure if it will cause problems.
