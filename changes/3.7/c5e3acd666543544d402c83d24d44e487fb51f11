s390/smp: avoid concurrent write to sigp status field

When a sigp instruction is issued it may store a status. This status is
currently stored in a per cpu field of the target cpu.
If multiple cpus issue a sigp instruction with the same target cpu
and a status is stored the result is not necessarily as expected.

Currently this is not an issue:
- on cpu hotplug no sigps, except "restart" and "sense" are sent to the
  target cpu.
- on external call we don't look at the status if it is stored
- on sense running the condition code "status stored" is sufficient to
  tell if a cpu is running or not
