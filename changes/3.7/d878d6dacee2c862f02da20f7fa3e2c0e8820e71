m68k: switch to generic sys_execve()/kernel_execve()

The tricky part here is that task_pt_regs() on m68k works *only* for
process inside do_signal().  However, we need something much simpler -
pt_regs of a process inside do_signal() may be at different offsets
from the stack bottom, depending on the way we'd entered the kernel,
but for a task inside sys_execve() it *is* at constant offset.
Moreover, for a kernel thread about to become a userland process the
same location is also fine - setting sp to that will leave the kernel
stack pointer at the very bottom of the kernel stack when we finally
switch to userland.
