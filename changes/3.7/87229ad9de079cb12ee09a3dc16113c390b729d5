drm: micro optimise cache flushing

We hit this a lot with i915 and although we'd like to engineer things to hit
it a lot less, this commit at least makes it consume a few less cycles.

from something containing
movzwl 0x0(%rip),%r10d
to
add    %r8,%rdx

I only noticed it while using perf to profile something else.
