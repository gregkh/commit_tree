Bluetooth: Fix error status when pairing fails

When pairing fails due to wrong confirm value, the management layer
doesn't report a proper error status. It sends
MGMT_STATUS_CONNECT_FAILED instead of MGMT_STATUS_AUTH_FAILED.

Most of management functions that receive a status as a parameter
expects for it to be encoded as a HCI status. But when a SMP pairing
fails, the SMP layer sends the SMP reason as the error status to the
management layer.

This commit maps all SMP reasons to HCI_ERROR_AUTH_FAILURE, which will
be converted to MGMT_STATUS_AUTH_FAILED in the management layer.
