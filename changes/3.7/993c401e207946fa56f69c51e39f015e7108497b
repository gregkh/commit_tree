mlx4_core: Add IB port-state machine and port mgmt event propagation

For an IB port, a slave should not show port active until that slave
has a valid alias-guid (provided by the subnet manager).  Therefore
the port-up event should be passed to a slave only after both the port
is up, and the slave's alias-guid has been set.

Also, provide the infrastructure for propagating port-management
events (client-reregister, etc) to slaves.
