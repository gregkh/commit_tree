ALSA: PCM: channel mapping API implementation

This patch implements the basic data types for the standard channel
mapping API handling.

- The definitions of the channel positions and the new TLV types are
  added in sound/asound.h and sound/tlv.h, so that they can be
  referred from user-space.

- Introduced a new helper function snd_pcm_add_chmap_ctls() to create
  control elements representing the channel maps for each PCM
  (sub)stream.

- Some standard pre-defined channel maps are provided for
  convenience.
