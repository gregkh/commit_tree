acpi-cpufreq: Add quirk to disable _PSD usage on all AMD CPUs

To workaround some Windows specific behavior, the ACPI _PSD table
on AMD desktop boards advertises all cores as dependent, meaning
that they all can only use the same P-state. acpi-cpufreq strictly
obeys this description, instantiating one CPU only and symlinking
the others. But the hardware can have distinct frequencies for each
core and powernow-k8 did it that way.
So, in order to use the hardware to its full potential and keep the
original powernow-k8 behavior, lets override the _PSD table setting
on AMD hardware.
We use the siblings table, as it matches the current hardware
behavior.
