batman-adv: don't add TEMP clients belonging to other backbone nodes

The "early client detection" mechanism must not add clients belonging
to other backbone nodes. Such clients must be reached by directly
using the LAN instead of the mesh.

This was introduced by 30cfd02b60e1cb16f5effb0a01f826c5bb7e4c59
("batman-adv: detect not yet announced clients")
