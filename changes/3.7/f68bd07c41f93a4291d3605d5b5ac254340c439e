qeth: fix possible memory leak in qeth_l3_add_[vipa|rxip]()

ipaddr has been allocated in function qeth_l3_add_vipa() but
does not free before leaving from the error handling cases. The
same problem also exists in function qeth_l3_add_rxip().

spatch with a semantic match is used to found this problem.
