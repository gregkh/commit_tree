ath9k: fix stale pointers potentially causing access to free'd skbs

bf->bf_next is only while buffers are chained as part of an A-MPDU
in the tx queue. When a tid queue is flushed (e.g. on tearing down
an aggregation session), frames can be enqueued again as normal
transmission, without bf_next being cleared. This can lead to the
old pointer being dereferenced again later.

This patch might fix crashes and "Failed to stop TX DMA!" messages.
