USB: sierra: fix port-data memory leak

Fix port-data memory leak by moving port data allocation and
deallocation to port_probe and port_remove.

Since commit 0998d0631001288 (device-core: Ensure drvdata = NULL when no
driver is bound) the port private data is no longer freed at release as
it is no longer accessible.

Note also that urb-count for multi-port interfaces has not been changed
even though the usb-serial port number is now determined from the port
and interface minor numbers.

Compile-only tested.
