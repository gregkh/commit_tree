[SCSI] Shorten the path length of scsi_cmd_to_driver()

This patch tries to shorten the path length of scsi_cmd_to_driver(). As only
REQ_TYPE_BLOCK_PC commands can be submitted without a driver, so we could
avoid the related NULL checking, as long as we make sure we don't use it for
REQ_TYPE_BLOCK_PC type commands. Plus, this fixes a bug where you get
different behaviors from REQ_TYPE_BLOCK_PC commands when a driver is and isn't
attached.
