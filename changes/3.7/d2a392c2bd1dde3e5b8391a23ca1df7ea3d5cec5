Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _stPhsRuleSI and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _stPhsRuleSI,
changes the name of the struct to
bcm_phs_rules, and updates the comments
appropriately. In addition, any
calls to typedefs "stPhsRuleSI,
*pstPhsRuleSI, or CPhsRuleSI" are
changed to call the struct directly.
