drxk: allow loading firmware synchrousnously

Due to udev-182, the firmware load was changed to be async, as
otherwise udev would give up of loading a firmware.

Add an option to return to the previous behaviour, async firmware
loads cause failures with the tda18271 driver.

Antti tested it with the following hardware:
        Hauppauge WinTV HVR 930C
        MaxMedia UB425-TC
        PCTV QuatroStick nano (520e)
