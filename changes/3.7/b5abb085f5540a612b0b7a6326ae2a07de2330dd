PM / Domains: Make it possible to use domain names when adding devices

Add a new helper function __pm_genpd_name_add_device() allowing
a device to be added to a (registered) generic PM domain identified
by name.  Add a wrapper around it, pm_genpd_name_add_device(),
passing NULL as the last argument and reorganize pm_domains.h for the
new functions to be defined consistently with the existing ones.

These functions are useful for adding devices to PM domains whose
representations are stored in tables, when the caller doesn't know
the index of the domain to add the device to, but it knows the
domain's name.
