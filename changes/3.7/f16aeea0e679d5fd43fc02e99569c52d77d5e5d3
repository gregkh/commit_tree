sfc: Change state names to be clearer, and comment them

STATE_INIT and STATE_FINI are equivalent and represent incompletely
initialised states; combine them as STATE_UNINIT.

Rename STATE_RUNNING to STATE_READY, to avoid confusion with
netif_running() and IFF_RUNNING.

The comments do not quite match current usage, but this will be
corrected in subsequent fixes.
