compat: move compat_siginfo_t definition to asm/compat.h

This is a preparatory patch for the introduction of NT_SIGINFO elf note.

Make the location of compat_siginfo_t uniform across eight architectures
which have it.  Now it can be pulled in by including asm/compat.h or
linux/compat.h.

Most of the copies are verbatim.  compat_uid[32]_t had to be replaced by
__compat_uid[32]_t.  compat_uptr_t had to be moved up before
compat_siginfo_t in asm/compat.h on a several architectures (tile already
had it moved up).  compat_sigval_t had to be relocated from linux/compat.h
to asm/compat.h.
