powerpc/85xx: Add support for P5040DS board

Add support for the Freescale P5040DS Reference Board ("Superhydra"), which
is similar to the P5020DS.  Features of the P5040 are listed below, but
not all of these features (e.g. DPAA networking) are currently supported.

Four P5040 single-threaded e5500 cores built
    Up to 2.4 GHz with 64-bit ISA support
    Three levels of instruction: user, supervisor, hypervisor
CoreNet platform cache (CPC)
    2.0 MB configures as dual 1 MB blocks hierarchical interconnect fabric
Two 64-bit DDR3/3L SDRAM memory controllers with ECC and interleaving
 support Up to 1600MT/s
    Memory pre-fetch engine
DPAA incorporating acceleration for the following functions
    Packet parsing, classification, and distribution (FMAN)
    Queue management for scheduling, packet sequencing and
	congestion management (QMAN)
    Hardware buffer management for buffer allocation and
	de-allocation (BMAN)
    Cryptography acceleration (SEC 5.0) at up to 40 Gbps SerDes
    20 lanes at up to 5 Gbps
    Supports SGMII, XAUI, PCIe rev1.1/2.0, SATA Ethernet interfaces
    Two 10 Gbps Ethernet MACs
    Ten 1 Gbps Ethernet MACs
High-speed peripheral interfaces
    Two PCI Express 2.0/3.0 controllers
Additional peripheral interfaces
    Two serial ATA (SATA 2.0) controllers
    Two high-speed USB 2.0 controllers with integrated PHY
    Enhanced secure digital host controller (SD/MMC/eMMC)
    Enhanced serial peripheral interface (eSPI)
    Two I2C controllers
    Four UARTs
    Integrated flash controller supporting NAND and NOR flash
DMA
    Dual four channel
Support for hardware virtualization and partitioning enforcement
    Extra privileged level for hypervisor support
QorIQ Trust Architecture 1.1
    Secure boot, secure debug, tamper detection, volatile key storage
