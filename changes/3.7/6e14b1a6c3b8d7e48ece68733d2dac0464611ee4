rbd: update remaining header fields for v2

There are three fields that are not yet updated for format 2 rbd
image headers:  the version of the header object; the encryption
type; and the compression type.  There is no interface defined for
fetching the latter two, so just initialize them explicitly to 0 for
now.

Change rbd_dev_v2_snap_context() so the caller can be supplied the
version for the header object.
