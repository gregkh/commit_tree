[SCSI] be2iscsi: Added Logging mechanism for the driver.

Added new log level mechanism for different events. These
log levels can be set at driver load time/run time. The
log level is set for each Scsi_host.

Fixed few multi-line print warning to get over the new checkpatch.pl
warnings on multi-line strings.
