timers: Fix endless looping between cascade() and internal_add_timer()

Adding two (or more) timers with large values for "expires" (they have
to reside within tv5 in the same list) leads to endless looping
between cascade() and internal_add_timer() in case CONFIG_BASE_SMALL
is one and jiffies are crossing the value 1 << 18. The bug was
introduced between 2.6.11 and 2.6.12 (and survived for quite some
time).

This patch ensures that when cascade() is called timers within tv5 are
not added endlessly to their own list again, instead they are added to
the next lower tv level tv4 (as expected).
