ARM: dt: tegra: cardhu: add entry for PMIC TPS65911.

Tegra30 based platform "cardhu" have the power management
IC TPS65911 for the regulator.
Adding DT entry for this device.
Data are chosen from downstream kernel and making the
voltage output as require by default for device to
operate.
The default interrupt line is HIGH from PMIC device and so
inverting the interrupt detection line of PMU interrupt
through configuring PMC.
In this patch, do not registering LDO5 because the input
supply for this rail is different for different version of
cardhu i..e A02 and A04. The registration will be done once
the dts file for cardhu A02 and A04 are added in follow on
patches.
