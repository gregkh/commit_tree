ext4: fix unwritten counter leakage

ext4_set_io_unwritten_flag() will increment i_unwritten counter, so
once we mark end_io with EXT4_END_IO_UNWRITTEN we have to revert it back
on error path.

 - add missed error checks to prevent counter leakage
 - ext4_end_io_nolock() will clear EXT4_END_IO_UNWRITTEN flag to signal
   that conversion finished.
 - add BUG_ON to ext4_free_end_io() to prevent similar leakage in future.

Visible effect of this bug is that unaligned aio_stress may deadlock
