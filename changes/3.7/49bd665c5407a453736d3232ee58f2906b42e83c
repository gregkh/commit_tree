[SCSI] isci: copy fis 0x34 response into proper buffer

SATA MICROCODE DOWNALOAD fails on isci driver. After receiving Register
Device to Host (FIS 0x34) frame Initiator resets phy.
In the frame handler routine response (FIS 0x34) was copied into wrong
buffer and upper layer did not receive any answer which resulted in
timeout and reset.
This patch corrects this bug.
