lib: vsprintf: optimize put_dec_trunc8()

If you're going to have a conditional branch after each 32x32->64-bit
multiply, might as well shrink the code and make it a loop.

This also avoids using the long multiply for small integers.

(This leaves the comments in a confusing state, but that's a separate
patch to make review easier.)
