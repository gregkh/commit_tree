drm/i915: Try harder to allocate an mmap_offset

Given the persistence of an offset for the lifetime of an object, itis
easy to contemplate how the mmap space becomes badly fragmented to the
point that further allocations fail with ENOSPC. Our only recourse at
this point is to try to purge the objects to release some space and
reattempt the allocation.
