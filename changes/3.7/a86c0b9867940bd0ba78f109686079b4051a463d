ARM: AM33XX: cm: Add bit-field width values

The new common clk framework includes basic definitions for mux and
divider clocks.  These definitions depend on shift and width values
instead of the pre-computed masks that the OMAP/AM33XX clk framework
has traditionally used when accessing the register to control the
mux or divisor.

To ease this transition the masks are left intact and
the width field is simply added alongside the shift and mask data.
