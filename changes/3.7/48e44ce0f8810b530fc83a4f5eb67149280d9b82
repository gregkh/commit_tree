iio:inkern: Add function to read the processed value

Add a function to read a processed value from a channel. The function will first
attempt to read the IIO_CHAN_INFO_PROCESSED attribute. If that fails it will
read the IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW attribute and convert the result from a raw value to
a processed value.

The patch also introduces a function to convert raw value to a processed value
and exports it, in case a user needs or wants to do the conversion by itself.
