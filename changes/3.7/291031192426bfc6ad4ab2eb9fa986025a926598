[media] V4L: Add [get/set]_frame_desc subdev callbacks

Add subdev callbacks for setting up parameters of the frame on media bus
that are not exposed to user space directly. This is just an initial,
mostly stub implementation. struct v4l2_mbus_frame_desc is intended
to be extended with sub-structures specific to a particular hardware media
bus. For now these new callbacks are used only to query or specify maximum
size of a compressed or hybrid (container) media bus frame in octets.
