mtd: nand: split extended ID decoding into its own function

When detecting NAND parameters, the code gets a little ugly so that the
logic is obscured. Try to remedy that by moving code to separate functions
that have well-defined purposes.

This patch splits out the extended ID decode functionality, which handles
decoding the 3rd-8th ID bytes to determine NAND device parameters.
