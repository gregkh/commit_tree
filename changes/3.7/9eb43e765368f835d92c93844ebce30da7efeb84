ipv4: Introduce IN_DEV_NET_ROUTE_LOCALNET

performance profiles show a high cost in the IN_DEV_ROUTE_LOCALNET()
call done in ip_route_input_slow(), because of multiple dereferences,
even if cache lines are clean and available in cpu caches.

Since we already have the 'net' pointer, introduce
IN_DEV_NET_ROUTE_LOCALNET() macro avoiding two dereferences
(dev_net(in_dev->dev))

Also change the tests to use IN_DEV_NET_ROUTE_LOCALNET() only if saddr
or/and daddr are loopback addresse.
