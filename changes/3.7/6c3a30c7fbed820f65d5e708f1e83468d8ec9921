serial: omap: don't save IRQ flags on hardirq

When we're running our hardirq handler, there's
not need to disable IRQs with spin_lock_irqsave()
because IRQs are already disabled. It also makes
no difference if we save or not IRQ flags.

Switch over to simple spin_lock/spin_unlock and
drop the "flags" variable.
