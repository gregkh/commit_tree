TTY: add support for unnumbered device nodes

This allows drivers like ttyprintk to avoid hacks to create an
unnumbered node in /dev. It used to set TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV in
flags and call device_create on its own. That is incorrect, because
TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV may be set only if tty_register_device is
called explicitly.
