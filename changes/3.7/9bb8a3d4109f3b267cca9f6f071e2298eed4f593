TTY: centralize fail paths in tty_register_driver

Currently, some failures are handled in if's false branches, some at
the end of tty_register_driver via goto-labels. Let us handle the
failures at the end of the functions to have the failure handling at
a single place. The only thing needed is to label the lines properly
and jump there.
