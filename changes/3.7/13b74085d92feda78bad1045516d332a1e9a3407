sata_mv: Fix warnings when no PCI

Dove can be configured without PCI. We then get a number of warnings:

warning: 'msi' defined but not used
warning: 'mv5_sht' defined but not used
warning: 'mv_dump_pci_cfg' defined but not used.

Move around variables and add #ifdef as necassary to fix the warnings.
