userns: Convert jffs2 to use kuid and kgid where appropriate

- General routine uid/gid conversion work
- When storing posix acls treat ACL_USER and ACL_GROUP separately
  so I can call from_kuid or from_kgid as appropriate.
- When reading posix acls treat ACL_USER and ACL_GROUP separately
  so I can call make_kuid or make_kgid as appropriate.
