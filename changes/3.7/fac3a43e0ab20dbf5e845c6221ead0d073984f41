usb: gadget: move bind callback into driver struct usb_composite_driver

It was moved to be an argument in 07a18bd716ed5 ("usb gadget: don't
save bind callback in struct usb_composite_driver"). The reason was to
avoid the section missmatch. The warning was shown because ->bind is
marked as __init becuase it is a one time init. The warning can be also
suppresed by whitelisting the variable i.e. rename it to lets say _probe.
