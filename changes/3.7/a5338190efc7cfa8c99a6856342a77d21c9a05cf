[media] v4l2-core: tvnorms may be 0 for a given input, handle that case

Currently the core code looks at tvnorms to see whether ENUMSTD
or G_PARM should be enabled. This is not a good check for drivers
that support the STD API on one input and the DV Timings API on another.
In that case tvnorms may be 0.
Instead check whether s_std is present (for ENUMSTD) or whether g_std or
current_norm is present for g_parm.
Also, in the enumstd core function return ENODATA if tvnorms is 0,
because in that case the current input does not support the STD API
and ENUMSTD should return ENODATA for that.
