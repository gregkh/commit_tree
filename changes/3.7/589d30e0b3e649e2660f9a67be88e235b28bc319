rbd: define rbd_dev_image_id()

New format 2 rbd images are permanently identified by a unique image
id.  Each rbd image also has a name, but the name can be changed.
A format 2 rbd image will have an object--whose name is based on the
image name--which maps an image's name to its image id.

Create a new function rbd_dev_image_id() that checks for the
existence of the image id object, and if it's found, records the
image id in the rbd_device structure.

Create a new rbd device attribute (/sys/bus/rbd/<num>/image_id) that
makes this information available.
