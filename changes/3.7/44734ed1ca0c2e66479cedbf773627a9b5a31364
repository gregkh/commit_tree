Btrfs: don't commit instead of overcommitting

I don't think we have the same problem that this was supposed to fix
originally since we can allocate chunks in the enospc path now.  This code
is causing us to constantly commit the transaction as we get close to using
all of our available space in our currently allocated chunks, instead of
allocating another chunk and carrying on with life, which is not nice for
performance.  Thanks,
