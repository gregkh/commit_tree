rbd: handle locking inside __rbd_client_find()

There is only caller of __rbd_client_find(), and it somewhat
clumsily gets the appropriate lock and gets a reference to the
existing ceph_client structure if it's found.

Instead, have that function handle its own locking, and acquire the
reference if found while it holds the lock.  Drop the underscores
from the name because there's no need to signify anything special
about this function.
