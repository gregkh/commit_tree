target/file: Re-enable optional fd_buffered_io=1 operation

This patch re-adds the ability to optionally run in buffered FILEIO mode
(eg: w/o O_DSYNC) for device backends in order to once again use the
Linux buffered cache as a write-back storage mechanism.

This logic was originally dropped with mainline v3.5-rc commit:

commit a4dff3043c231d57f982af635c9d2192ee40e5ae
Author: Nicholas Bellinger <nab@linux-iscsi.org>
Date:   Wed May 30 16:25:41 2012 -0700

    target/file: Use O_DSYNC by default for FILEIO backends

This difference with this patch is that fd_create_virtdevice() now
forces the explicit setting of emulate_write_cache=1 when buffered FILEIO
operation has been enabled.

(v2: Switch to FDBD_HAS_BUFFERED_IO_WCE + add more detailed
     comment as requested by hch)
