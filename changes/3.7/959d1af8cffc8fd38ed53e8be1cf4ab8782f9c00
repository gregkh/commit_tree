workqueue: add missing smp_wmb() in process_one_work()

WORK_STRUCT_PENDING is used to claim ownership of a work item and
process_one_work() releases it before starting execution.  When
someone else grabs PENDING, all pre-release updates to the work item
should be visible and all updates made by the new owner should happen
afterwards.

Grabbing PENDING uses test_and_set_bit() and thus has a full barrier;
however, clearing doesn't have a matching wmb.  Given the preceding
spin_unlock and use of clear_bit, I don't believe this can be a
problem on an actual machine and there hasn't been any related report
but it still is theretically possible for clear_pending to permeate
upwards and happen before work->entry update.

Add an explicit smp_wmb() before work_clear_pending().
