ARM: Xen: fix initial build problems

* The XEN_BALLOON code requires the balloon infrastructure that is not
  getting built on ARM.

* The tmem hypercall is not available on ARM

* ARMv6 does not support cmpxchg on 16-bit words that are used in the
  Xen grant table code, so we must ensure that Xen support is only
  built on ARMv7-only kernels not combined ARMv6/v7 kernels.

* sys-hypervisor.c needs to include linux/err.h in order to use the
  IS_ERR/PTR_ERR/ERR_PTR family of functions.
