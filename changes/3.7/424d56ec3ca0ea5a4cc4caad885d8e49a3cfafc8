staging: tidspbridge: fix uuid strings

Commit 8cb05f4b54535cb91d7a5f9f8eb230bd4fa86e4e (staging:
tidspbridge: eliminate uuid_uuid_to_string), not only broke
compilation but also functionality for tidspbridge driver.

So:
- Replace remaining instances of uuid_uuid_to_string with snprintf
  to fix compilation.
- Fix the format from %pU to %pUL.
- Since these UUIDs are used in the firmware to reference section
  names, the firmware doesn't follow the standard uuid delimiter '-'
  it uses '_' instead. The driver can follow the standard convention
  however for dsp sections we must transform the uuid to what is
  expected by the firmware. E.g.:

  tidspbridge sees: 24BC8D90-BB45-11D4-B756-006008BDB66F
  firmware expects: .24BC8D90_BB45_11D4_B756_006008BDB66F
