FRV: Fix the preemption handling

Fix the preemption handling in FRV code where the PREEMPT_ACTIVE value is
incorrectly loaded into the threadinfo flags rather than the threadinfo
preemption count.

Unfortunately, the code cannot be simply converted to use
preempt_schedule_irq() as is because FRV uses virtual interrupt disablement to
cut down on the cost of actually disabling interrupts and thus
local_irq_enable() doesn't actually enable interrupts.
