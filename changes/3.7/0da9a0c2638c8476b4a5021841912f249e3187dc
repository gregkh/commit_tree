sctp: fix /proc/net/sctp/ memory leak

Commit 13d782f ("sctp: Make the proc files per network namespace.")
changed the /proc/net/sctp/ struct file_operations opener functions to
use single_open_net() and seq_open_net().

Avoid leaking memory by using single_release_net() and seq_release_net()
as the release functions.

Discovered with Trinity (the syscall fuzzer).
