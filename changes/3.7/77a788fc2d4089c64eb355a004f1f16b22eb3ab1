[media] s5p-mfc: Prepare driver for callback based re-architecture

The patch renames hardware specific opr and cmd files to
opr_v5 and cmd_v5 respectively. This is done for accomodating
firmware v6. Also the shared memory management files are removed
and the functionality is added to the opr_v5 file.
