ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod data: Fix PMU interrupt definitions

Commit 7d7e1eb (ARM: OMAP2+: Prepare for irqs.h removal) and commit ec2c082
(ARM: OMAP2+: Remove hardcoded IRQs and enable SPARSE_IRQ) updated the way
interrupts for OMAP2/3 devices are defined in the HWMOD data structures to
being an index plus a fixed offset (defined by OMAP_INTC_START). The definition
of the PMU interrupts on OMAP2/3 devices is missing the OMAP_INTC_START offset
and so this is causing the allocation of PMU interrupts to fail on OMAP2/3
devices. So add the offset to fix this.

This is patch is based upon Tony's master branch for OMAP.
