lib/Makefile: Fix oid_registry build dependency

It is $(obj)/oid_registry.o that is dependent on $(obj)/oid_registry_data.c.
The object file cannot be built until $(obj)/oid_registry_data.c has been
generated.

A periodic and hard to reproduce parallel build failure is due to
this incorrect lib/Makefile dependency. The compile error is completely
disingenuous.
