spi/imx: make spi_imx_data.devtype_data member point to const data

This prepares *of_device_id.data becoming const. Without this change the
following warning would occur:

	drivers/spi/spi-imx.c: In function spi_imx_probe:
	drivers/spi/spi-imx.c:814:24: warning: assignment discards const qualifier from pointer target type [enabled by default]
