Thermal: Introduce .get_trend() callback.

According to ACPI spec, tc1 and tc2 are used by OSPM
to anticipate the temperature trends.
We introduced the same concept to the generic thermal layer
for passive cooling, but now it seems that these values
are hard to be used on other platforms.

So We introduce .get_trend() as a more general solution.

For the platform thermal drivers that have their own way to
anticipate the temperature trends, they should provide
their own .get_trend() callback.
Or else, we will calculate the temperature trends by simply
comparing the current temperature and the cached previous
temperature reading.
