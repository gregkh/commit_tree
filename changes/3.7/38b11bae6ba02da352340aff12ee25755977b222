iscsi-target: Add explicit set of cache_dynamic_acls=1 for TPG demo-mode

We've had reports in the past about this specific case, so it's time to
go ahead and explicitly set cache_dynamic_acls=1 for generate_node_acls=1
(TPG demo-mode) operation.

During normal generate_node_acls=0 operation with explicit NodeACLs ->
se_node_acl memory is persistent to the configfs group located at
/sys/kernel/config/target/$TARGETNAME/$TPGT/acls/$INITIATORNAME, so in
the generate_node_acls=1 case we want the reservation logic to reference
existing per initiator IQN se_node_acl memory (not to generate a new
se_node_acl), so go ahead and always set cache_dynamic_acls=1 when
TPG demo-mode is enabled.
