staging: comedi: me4000: remove me4000.h

Move the remaining defines in this header to the c file. Nothing
in the header is needed by any other file.

While moving the defines, reorder them so that the bit defines
are associated with the register they go with. Also, convert the
bit defines to bit shifts to make them a bit clearer.
