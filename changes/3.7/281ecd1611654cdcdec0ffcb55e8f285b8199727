ASoC: twl4030: Move hs_extmute GPIO handling to driver

The external mute (if it is in use) is handled by a GPIO line. Prepare to
remove the set_hs_extmute callback and replace it with:
hs_extmute_gpio: the GPIO number to use for external mute

When the users of set_hs_extmute has been converted the callback can be removed.
