X86: Improve GOP detection in the EFI boot stub

We currently use the PCI IO protocol as a proxy for a functional GOP. This
is less than ideal, since some platforms will put the GOP on output devices
rather than the GPU itself. Move to using the conout protocol. This is not
guaranteed per-spec, but is part of the consplitter implementation that
causes this problem in the first place and so should be reliable.
