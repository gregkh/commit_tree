ixgbe: Fix ordering of things so that PF correctly configures its VLANs

The PF was not correctly registering any of its VLANs.  As a result any
VLAN tagged traffic from the VF would not be delivered to the PF because
the VLAN was never assigned to the PF pool.

In addition the VF was not allowed to receive traffic from VLAN 0 if it was
allowed to receive untagged frames.  This change corrects that so that it
will correctly receive traffic from VLAN 0.
