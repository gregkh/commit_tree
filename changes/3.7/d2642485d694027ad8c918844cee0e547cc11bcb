[media] V4L: Add V4L2_MBUS_FMT_S5C_UYVY_JPEG_1X8 media bus format

This patch adds media bus pixel code for the interleaved JPEG/UYVY
image format used by S5C73MX Samsung cameras. This interleaved image
data is transferred on MIPI-CSI2 bus as User Defined Byte-based Data.
It also defines an experimental vendor and device specific media bus
formats section and adds related DocBook documentation.
