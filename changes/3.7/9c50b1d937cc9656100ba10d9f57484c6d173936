DRM/Radeon: Fix primary DAC Load Detection for RV100 chips.

For Radeon 7500 ATI recommends a DAC_FORCE value of 0x1ac. This value
works better on ES1000 (RV100) chips, too, as it doesn't produce any false
positives on any cards I have tested. Therefore let's assume that this
value is good for all RV100 and RV200 chipset generations.
