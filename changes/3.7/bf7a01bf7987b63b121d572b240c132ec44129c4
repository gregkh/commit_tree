mtd: nand: allow NAND_NO_SUBPAGE_WRITE to be set from driver

The NAND_CHIPOPTIONS_MSK has limited utility and is causing real bugs. It
silently masks off at least one flag that might be set by the driver
(NAND_NO_SUBPAGE_WRITE). This breaks the GPMI NAND driver and possibly
others.

Really, as long as driver writers exercise a small amount of care with
NAND_* options, this mask is not necessary at all; it was only here to
prevent certain options from accidentally being set by the driver. But the
original thought turns out to be a bad idea occasionally. Thus, kill it.

Note, this patch fixes some major gpmi-nand breakage.
