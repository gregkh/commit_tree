md/raid5: make sure to_read and to_write never go negative.

to_read and to_write are part of the result of analysing
a stripe before handling it.
Their use is to avoid some loops and tests if the values are
known to be zero.  Thus it is not a problem if they are a
little bit larger than they should be.

So decrementing them in handle_failed_stripe serves little value, and
due to races it could cause some loops to be skipped incorrectly.

So remove those decrements.
