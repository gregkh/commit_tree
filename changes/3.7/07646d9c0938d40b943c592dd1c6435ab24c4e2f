firmware loader: cache devices firmware during suspend/resume cycle

This patch implements caching devices' firmware automatically
during system syspend/resume cycle, so any device drivers can
call request_firmware or request_firmware_nowait inside resume
path to get the cached firmware if they have loaded firmwares
successfully at least once before entering suspend.
