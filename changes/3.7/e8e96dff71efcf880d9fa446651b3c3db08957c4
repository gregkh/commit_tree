ARM: OMAP: hwmod: revise deassert sequence

For a reset sequence to complete cleanly, a module needs its
associated clocks to be enabled, otherwise the timeout check
in prcm code can print a false failure (failed to hardreset)
that occurs because the clocks aren't powered ON and the status
bit checked can't transition without them.
