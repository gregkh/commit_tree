serial: omap: move THRE check to transmit_chars()

since all other IRQ types now do all necessary
checks inside their handlers, transmit_chars()
was the only one left expecting serial_omap_irq()
to check THRE for it. We can move THRE check to
transmit_chars() in order to make serial_omap_irq()
more uniform.
