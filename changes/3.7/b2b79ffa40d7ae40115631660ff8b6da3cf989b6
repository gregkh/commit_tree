iio: inkern: add error case in iio_channel_get()

 The datasheet name is defined in the IIO driver.
 On the other hand, the adc_channel_label is configured in
 the platform side.
 If the datasheet name is not matched with any adc_channel_label,
 the iio_channel_get() should be returned as error for preventing
 invalid channel data access.

 This can be handled either way.
 (a) checking null data when using it : in the xxx_read_raw()
 or
 (b) error returns when the channel is requested : this patch

 The IIO consumer can't use the channel with invalid channel spec.
 Therefore case (b) is more reasonable.
