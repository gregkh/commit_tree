x86, EFI: Calculate the EFI framebuffer size instead of trusting the firmware

Seth Forshee reported that his system was reporting that the EFI framebuffer
stretched from 0x90010000-0xb0010000 despite the GPU's BAR only covering
0x90000000-0x9ffffff. It's safer to calculate this value from the pixel
stride and screen height (values we already depend on) rather than face
potential problems with resource allocation later on.
