xen/mm: return more precise error from xen_remap_domain_range()

Callers of xen_remap_domain_range() need to know if the remap failed
because frame is currently paged out.  So they can retry the remap
later on.  Return -ENOENT in this case.

This assumes that the error codes returned by Xen are a subset of
those used by the kernel.  It is unclear if this is defined as part of
the hypercall ABI.
