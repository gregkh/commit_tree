NFSv4.1: pNFS data servers may be temporarily offline

In cases where the pNFS data server is just temporarily out of service,
we want to mark it as such, and then try again later. Typically that will
be in cases of network connection errors etc.
This patch allows us to mark the devices as being "unavailable" for such
transient errors, and will make them available for retries after a
2 minute timeout period.
