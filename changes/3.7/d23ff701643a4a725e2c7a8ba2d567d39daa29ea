tcp: add generic netlink support for tcp_metrics

Add support for genl "tcp_metrics". No locking
is changed, only that now we can unlink and delete
entries after grace period. We implement get/del for
single entry and dump to support show/flush filtering
in user space. Del without address attribute causes
flush for all addresses, sadly under genl_mutex.

v2:
- remove rcu_assign_pointer as suggested by Eric Dumazet,
it is not needed because there are no other writes under lock
- move the flushing code in tcp_metrics_flush_all

v3:
- remove synchronize_rcu on flush as suggested by Eric Dumazet
