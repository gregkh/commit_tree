xen/pv-on-hvm kexec: add quirk for Xen 3.4 and shutdown watches.

The commit 254d1a3f02ebc10ccc6e4903394d8d3f484f715e, titled
"xen/pv-on-hvm kexec: shutdown watches from old kernel" assumes that the
XenBus backend can deal with reading of values from:
 "control/platform-feature-xs_reset_watches":

    ... a patch for xenstored is required so that it
    accepts the XS_RESET_WATCHES request from a client (see changeset
    23839:42a45baf037d in xen-unstable.hg). Without the patch for xenstored
    the registration of watches will fail and some features of a PVonHVM
    guest are not available. The guest is still able to boot, but repeated
    kexec boots will fail."

Sadly this is not true when using a Xen 3.4 hypervisor and booting a PVHVM
guest. We end up hanging at:

  err = xenbus_scanf(XBT_NIL, "control",
                        "platform-feature-xs_reset_watches", "%d", &supported);

This can easily be seen with guests hanging at xenbus_init:

NX (Execute Disable) protection: active
SMBIOS 2.4 present.
DMI: Xen HVM domU, BIOS 3.4.0 05/13/2011
Hypervisor detected: Xen HVM
Xen version 3.4.
Xen Platform PCI: I/O protocol version 1
... snip ..
calling  xenbus_init+0x0/0x27e @ 1

Reverting the commit or using the attached patch fixes the issue. This fix
checks whether the hypervisor is older than 4.0 and if so does not try to
perform the read.
