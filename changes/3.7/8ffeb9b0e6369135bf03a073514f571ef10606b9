watchdog: using u64 in get_sample_period()

In get_sample_period(), unsigned long is not enough:

  watchdog_thresh * 2 * (NSEC_PER_SEC / 5)

case1:
  watchdog_thresh is 10 by default, the sample value will be: 0xEE6B2800

case2:
 set watchdog_thresh is 20, the sample value will be: 0x1 DCD6 5000

In case2, we need use u64 to express the sample period.  Otherwise,
changing the threshold thru proc often can not be successful.
