ARM: kernel: update __cpu_disable to use cache LoUIS maintenance API

When a CPU is hotplugged out caches that reside in its power domain
lose their contents and so must be cleaned to the next memory level.

Currently, __cpu_disable calls flush_cache_all() that for new generation
processor like A15/A7 ends up cleaning and invalidating all cache levels
up to Level of Coherency, which includes the unified L2.

This ends up being a waste of cycles since the L2 cache contents are not
lost on power down.

This patch updates __cpu_disable to use the new LoUIS API cache operations.
