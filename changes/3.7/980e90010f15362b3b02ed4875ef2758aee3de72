mlx4_core: INIT/CLOSE port logic for IB ports in SR-IOV mode

Normally, INIT_PORT and CLOSE_PORT are invoked when special QP0
transitions to RTR, or transitions to ERR/RESET respectively.

In SR-IOV mode, however, the master is also paravirtualized.  This in
turn requires that we not do INIT_PORT until the entire QP0 path (real
QP0 and proxy QP0) is ready to receive.  When the real QP0 goes down,
we should indicate that the port is not active.
