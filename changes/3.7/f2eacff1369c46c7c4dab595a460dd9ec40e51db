staging: comedi: dnya_pci10xx: cleanup the analog output range

The analog output channels on this board only support a single
range, 0-10V unipolar. This range is available as an exported
symbol from the comedi core and "range_unipolar10". Use that
instead of duplicating the range in this driver and remove
the information from the boardinfo.
