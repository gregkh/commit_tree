drm/i915: Support for ns2501-DVO

This patch adds support for the ns2501 DVO, found in some older Fujitsu/Siemens Labtops.
It is in the state of "works for me".
Includes now proper DPMS support. Includes switching between resolutions -
from 640x480 to 1024x768.
Currently assumes that the native display resolution is 1024x768.

The ns2501 seems to be rather critical - if the output PLL is not
running, the chip doesn't seem to be clocked and then doesn't react
on i2c messages. Thus, a quick'n-dirty trick ensures that the DVO
is active before submitting any i2c messages to it. This is
probably to be reviewed.
