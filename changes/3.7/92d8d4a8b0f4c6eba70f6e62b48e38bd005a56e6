tracing/filter: Add missing initialization

Add missing initialization for ret variable. Its initialization
is based on the re_cnt variable, which is being set deep down
in the ftrace_function_filter_re function.

I'm not sure compilers would be smart enough to see this in near
future, so killing the warning this way.
