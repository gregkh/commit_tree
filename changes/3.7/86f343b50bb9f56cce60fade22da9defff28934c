rcu: Fix CONFIG_RCU_FAST_NO_HZ stall warning message

The print_cpu_stall_fast_no_hz() function attempts to print -1 when
the ->idle_gp_timer is not pending, but unsigned arithmetic causes it
to instead print ULONG_MAX, which is 4294967295 on 32-bit systems and
18446744073709551615 on 64-bit systems.  Neither of these are the most
reader-friendly values, so this commit instead causes "timer not pending"
to be printed when ->idle_gp_timer is not pending.
