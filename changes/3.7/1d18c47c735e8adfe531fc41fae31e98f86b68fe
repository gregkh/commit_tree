arm64: MMU fault handling and page table management

This patch adds support for the handling of the MMU faults (exception
entry code introduced by a previous patch) and page table management.

The user translation table is pointed to by TTBR0 and the kernel one
(swapper_pg_dir) by TTBR1. There is no translation information shared or
address space overlapping between user and kernel page tables.
