bnx2x: fix ring size for 10G functions

Commit d760fc37b0f74502b3f748951f22c6683b079a8e caused
1G functions to allocate rx rings which were 1/10 of the
size of 10G functions' rx rings.

However, it also caused 10G functions on 5771x boards to
allocate small rings, which limits their possible (default)
rx throughput. This patch causes all 10G functions to use
rings of intended length by default.
