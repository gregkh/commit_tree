drm: refcnt drm_framebuffer (v4.1)

This simplifies drm fb lifetime, and if the crtc/plane needs to hold
a ref to the fb when disabling a pipe until the next vblank, this
avoids the need to make disabling an overlay synchronous.  This is a
problem that shows up when userspace is using a drm plane to
implement a hw cursor.. making overlay disable synchronous causes
a performance problem when x11 is rapidly enabling/disabling the
hw cursor.  But not making it synchronous opens up a race condition
for crashing if userspace turns around and immediately deletes the
fb.  Refcnt'ing the fb makes it possible to solve this problem.

v1: original
v2: add drm_framebuffer_remove() which is called in all paths where
    fb->funcs->destroy() was directly called before.  This cleans
    up the CRTCs/planes that the fb was attached to.  You should
    only directly use drm_framebuffer_unreference() if you are also
    using drm_framebuffer_reference() to keep a ref to the fb.
v3: add comment explaining the fb refcount
v4: remove duplicate 'list_del(&fb->filp_head)'
