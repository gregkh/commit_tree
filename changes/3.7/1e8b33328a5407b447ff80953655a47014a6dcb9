blockdev: remove bd_block_size_semaphore again

This reverts the block-device direct access code to the previous
unlocked code, now that fs/buffer.c no longer needs external locking.

With this, fs/block_dev.c is back to the original version, apart from a
whitespace cleanup that I didn't want to revert.
