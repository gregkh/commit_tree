x86, mm: Correct vmflag test for checking VM_HUGETLB

commit 611ae8e3f5204f7480b3b405993b3352cfa16662('enable tlb flush range
support for x86') change flush_tlb_mm_range() considerably. After this,
we test whether vmflag equal to VM_HUGETLB and it may be always failed,
because vmflag usually has other flags simultaneously.
Our intention is to check whether this vma is for hughtlb, so correct it
according to this purpose.
