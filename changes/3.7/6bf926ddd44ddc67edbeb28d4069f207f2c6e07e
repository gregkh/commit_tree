xen/generic: Disable fallback build on ARM.

As there is no need for it (the fallback code is for older
hypervisors and they only run under x86), and also b/c
we get:

drivers/xen/fallback.c: In function 'xen_event_channel_op_compat':
drivers/xen/fallback.c:10:19: error: storage size of 'op' isn't known
drivers/xen/fallback.c:15:2: error: implicit declaration of function '_hypercall1' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/xen/fallback.c:15:19: error: expected expression before 'int'
drivers/xen/fallback.c:18:7: error: 'EVTCHNOP_close' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/xen/fallback.c:18:7: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
.. and more

[v1: Moved the enablement to be covered by CONFIG_X86 per Ian's suggestion]
