mm: remove vma arg from page_evictable

page_evictable(page, vma) is an irritant: almost all its callers pass
NULL for vma.  Remove the vma arg and use mlocked_vma_newpage(vma, page)
explicitly in the couple of places it's needed.  But in those places we
don't even need page_evictable() itself!  They're dealing with a freshly
allocated anonymous page, which has no "mapping" and cannot be mlocked yet.
