rbd: call set_snap() before snap_devs_update()

rbd_header_set_snap() is a simple initialization routine for an rbd
device's mapping.  It has to be called after the snapshot context
for the rbd_dev has been updated, but can be done before snapshot
devices have been registered.

Change the name to rbd_dev_set_mapping() to better reflect its
purpose, and call it a little sooner, before registering snapshot
devices.
