Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _stLocalSFDeleteRequest and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _stLocalSFDeleteRequest,
and changes the name of the struct to
bcm_del_request. In addition, any
calls to typedefs "stLocalSFDeleteRequest or
*pstLocalSFDeleteRequest" are
changed to call the struct directly.
