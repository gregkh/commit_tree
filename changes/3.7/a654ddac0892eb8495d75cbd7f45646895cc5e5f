drivers/video/msm/mddi_client_nt35399.c: use devm_ functions

The various devm_ functions allocate memory that is released when a driver
detaches. This patch replaces the use of kzalloc by devm_kzalloc.

Additionally, this patch fixes a memory leak: some memory was allocated for
'panel' but not released when the subsequent call to setup_vsync fails.
