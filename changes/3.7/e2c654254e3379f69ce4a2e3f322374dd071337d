serial: sunsu.c - don't explicitly tie array size to dynamic entity

The addition of 8250-like entities continues to grow, while this
driver has a snapshot of a select few common 8250 UARTs.  So it
has no need to grow with the new additions, since it calls out
its own (largely historic) static list which does not grow.
