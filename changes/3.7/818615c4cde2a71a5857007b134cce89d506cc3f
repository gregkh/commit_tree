rcu: Pull TINY_RCU dyntick-idle tracing into non-idle region

Because TINY_RCU's idle detection keys directly off of the nesting
level, rather than from a separate variable as in TREE_RCU, the
TINY_RCU dyntick-idle tracing on transition to idle must happen
before the change to the nesting level.  This commit therefore makes
this change by passing the desired new value (rather than the old value)
of the nesting level in to rcu_idle_enter_common().
