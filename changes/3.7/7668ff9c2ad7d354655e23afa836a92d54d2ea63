sfc: Refactor struct efx_tx_buffer to use a flags field

Add a flags field to struct efx_tx_buffer, replacing the
continuation and map_single booleans.

Since a single descriptor cannot be both a TSO header and the last
descriptor for an skb, unionise efx_tx_buffer::{skb,tsoh} and add
flags for validity of these fields.

Clear all flags in free buffers (whereas previously the continuation
flag would be set).
