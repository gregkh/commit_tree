ARM: bcm2835: instantiate console UART

This patch was extracted from git://github.com/lp0/linux.git branch
rpi-split as of 2012/09/08, and modified as follows:

* s/bcm2708/bcm2835/.
* Modified device tree vendor prefix.
* Modified UART DT node to use a unit-address to create unique UART node
  names, rather than using non-type names "uart0" and "uart1".
  Note that UART 1 (the Broadcom "mini UART") is not yet present, but
  I'm naming the DT node in anticipation that it will be added.
