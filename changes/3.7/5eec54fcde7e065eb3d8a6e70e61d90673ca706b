UDF: Add support for O_DIRECT

Add support for the O_DIRECT flag.  There are two cases to deal with:

1. Small files stored in the ICB (inode control block?): just return 0
from the new udf_adinicb_direct_IO() handler to fall back to buffered
I/O.

2. Larger files, not stored in the ICB: nothing special here.  Just call
blockdev_direct_IO() from our new udf_direct_IO() handler and tidy up
any blocks instantiated outside i_size on error.  This is pretty
standard.  Factor error handling code out of udf_write_begin() into new
function udf_write_failed() so it can also be called by udf_direct_IO().

Also change the whitespace in udf_aops to make it a bit neater.
