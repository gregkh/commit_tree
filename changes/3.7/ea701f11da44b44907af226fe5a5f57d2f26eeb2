ftrace: Add selftest to test function trace recursion protection

Add selftests to test the function tracing recursion protection actually
does work. It also tests if a ftrace_ops states it will perform its own
protection. Although, even if the ftrace_ops states it will protect itself,
the ftrace infrastructure may still provide protection if the arch does
not support all features or another ftrace_ops is registered.
