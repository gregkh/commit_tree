checkpatch: check networking specific block comment style

In an effort to get fewer checkpatch reviewer corrections, add a
networking specific style test for the preferred networking comment style.

	/* The preferred style for block comments in
	 * drivers/net/... and net/... is like this
	 */

These tests are only used in net/ and drivers/net/

Tested with:

$ cat drivers/net/t.c

/* foo */

/*
 * foo
 */

/* foo
 */

/* foo
 * bar */
$ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f drivers/net/t.c
WARNING: networking block comments don't use an empty /* line, use /* Comment...
#4: FILE: net/t.c:4:
+
+/*

WARNING: networking block comments put the trailing */ on a separate line
#12: FILE: net/t.c:12:
+ * bar */

total: 0 errors, 2 warnings, 12 lines checked
