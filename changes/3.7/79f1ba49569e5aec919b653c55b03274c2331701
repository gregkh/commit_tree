ext4: Checksum the block bitmap properly with bigalloc enabled

In mke2fs, we only checksum the whole bitmap block and it is right.
While in the kernel, we use EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP to indicate the
size of the checksumed bitmap which is wrong when we enable bigalloc.
The right size should be EXT4_CLUSTERS_PER_GROUP and this patch fixes
it.

Also as every caller of ext4_block_bitmap_csum_set and
ext4_block_bitmap_csum_verify pass in EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb)/8,
we'd better removes this parameter and sets it in the function itself.
