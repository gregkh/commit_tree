RDMA/cma: Use consistent component mask for IPoIB port space multicast joins

CMA multicast joins for the IPoIB port space need to use the same
component mask used by the ipoib driver.  Otherwise, it's possible for
the CMA to create a group to which a join made by ipoib will fail, or
vise-versa.  Some of the component mask fields set by ipoib weren't
set by the CMA, fix that.
