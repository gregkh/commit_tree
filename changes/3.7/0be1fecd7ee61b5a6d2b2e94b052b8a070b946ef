md faulty: use disk_stack_limits()

in:
fe86cdce block: do not artificially constrain max_sectors for stacking drivers

max_sectors defaults to UINT_MAX.  md faulty wasn't using
disk_stack_limits(), so inherited this large value as well.
This triggered a bug in XFS when stressed over md_faulty, when
a very large bio_alloc() failed.

That was on an older kernel, and I can't reproduce exactly the
same thing upstream, but I think the fix is appropriate in any
case.

Thanks to Mike Snitzer for pointing out the problem.
