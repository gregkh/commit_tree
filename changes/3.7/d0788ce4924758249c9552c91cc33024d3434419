mtd: physmap_of: Add "no-unaligned-direct-access" DT property

On some platforms (e.g. MPC5200) a direct 1:1 mapping may cause
problems with JFFS2 usage, as the local bus (LPB) doesn't support
unaligned accesses as implemented in the JFFS2 code via memcpy().
By defining "no-unaligned-direct-access", the flash will not be
exposed directly to the MTD users (e.g. JFFS2) any more.
