powerpc: Add denormalisation exception handling for POWER6/7

On POWER6 and POWER7 if the input operand to an instruction is a
denormalised single precision binary floating point value we can take
a denormalisation exception where it's expected that the hypervisor
(HV=1) will fix up the inputs before the instruction is run.

This adds code to handle this denormalisation exception for POWER6 and
POWER7.

It also add a CONFIG_PPC_DENORMALISATION option and sets it in
pseries/ppc64_defconfig.

This is useful on bare metal systems only.  Based on patch from Milton
Miller.
