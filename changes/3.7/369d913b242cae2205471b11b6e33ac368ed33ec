ACPI: Harden acpi_table_parse_entries() against BIOS bug

Parsing acpi table entries may fall into an infinite loop on a buggy BIOS
which has entry length=0 in acpi table.

Instead of kernel hang with few failure clue which leads to heavy lifting debug
effort, this patch hardens kernel boot by booting into non NUMA mode. The debug
info left in log buffer helps people identify the issue.
