SUNRPC: Prevent races in xs_abort_connection()

The call to xprt_disconnect_done() that is triggered by a successful
connection reset will trigger another automatic wakeup of all tasks
on the xprt->pending rpc_wait_queue. In particular it will cause an
early wake up of the task that called xprt_connect().

All we really want to do here is clear all the socket-specific state
flags, so we split that functionality out of xs_sock_mark_closed()
into a helper that can be called by xs_abort_connection()
