TTY: add tty_port_link_device

This is for those drivers which do not have dynamic device creation
(do not call tty_port_register_device) and do not want to implement
tty->ops->install (will not call tty_port_install). They still have to
provide the link somehow though.

And this newly added function is exactly to serve that purpose.
