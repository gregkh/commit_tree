rbtree: handle 1-child recoloring in rb_erase() instead of rb_erase_color()

An interesting observation for rb_erase() is that when a node has
exactly one child, the node must be black and the child must be red.
An interesting consequence is that removing such a node can be done by
simply replacing it with its child and making the child black,
which we can do efficiently in rb_erase(). __rb_erase_color() then
only needs to handle the no-childs case and can be modified accordingly.
