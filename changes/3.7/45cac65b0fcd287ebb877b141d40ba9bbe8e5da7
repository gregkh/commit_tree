readahead: fault retry breaks mmap file read random detection

.fault now can retry.  The retry can break state machine of .fault.  In
filemap_fault, if page is miss, ra->mmap_miss is increased.  In the second
try, since the page is in page cache now, ra->mmap_miss is decreased.  And
these are done in one fault, so we can't detect random mmap file access.

Add a new flag to indicate .fault is tried once.  In the second try, skip
ra->mmap_miss decreasing.  The filemap_fault state machine is ok with it.

I only tested x86, didn't test other archs, but looks the change for other
archs is obvious, but who knows :)
