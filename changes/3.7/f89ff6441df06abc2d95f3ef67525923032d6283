b43: Fix oops on unload when firmware not found

When b43 fails to find firmware when loaded, a subsequent unload will
oops due to calling ieee80211_unregister_hw() when the corresponding
register call was never made.

Commit 2d838bb608e2d1f6cb4280e76748cb812dc822e7 fixed the same problem
for b43legacy.
