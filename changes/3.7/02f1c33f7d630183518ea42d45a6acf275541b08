perf scripts python: Add a python library EventClass.py

This library defines several class types for perf events which could
help to better analyze the event samples. Currently there are just a few
classes, PerfEvent is the base class for all perf events,  PebsEvent is
a HW base Intel x86 PEBS event, and user could add more SW/HW event
classes based on requriements.
