localmodconfig: Set default value for ksource in streamline_config.pl

Running streamline_config.pl as it's shown it in the comment header,
you will get a warning about $ksource being uninitialized.  This is
because $ksource is set to ARGV[0], but the examples don't require any
arguments.  Fix by setting ksource to . if no ARGV[0] is given.
