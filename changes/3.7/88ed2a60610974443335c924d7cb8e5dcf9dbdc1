n_gsm: memory leak in uplink error path

Uplink (TX) network data will go through gsm_dlci_data_output_framed
there is a bug where if memory allocation fails, the skb which
has already been pulled off the list will be lost.

In addition TX skbs were being processed in LIFO order

Fixed the memory leak, and changed to FIFO order processing
