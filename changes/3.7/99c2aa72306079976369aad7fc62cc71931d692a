firmware loader: fix creation failure of fw loader device

If one device driver calls request_firmware_nowait() to request
several different firmwares' loading, device_add() will return
failure since all firmware loader device use same name of the
device who is requesting firmware.

This patch always use the name of firmware image as the firmware
loader device name to fix the problem since the following patches
for caching firmware will make sure only one loading for same
firmware is alllowd at the same time.
