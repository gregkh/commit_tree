rbd: don't register snapshots in bus_add_dev()

When rbd_bus_add_dev() is called (one spot--in rbd_add()), the rbd
image header has not even been read yet.  This means that the list
of snapshots will be empty at the time of the call.  As a result,
there is no need for the code that calls rbd_register_snap_dev()
for each entry in that list--so get rid of it.

Once the header has been read (just after returning), a call will
be made to rbd_dev_snap_devs_update(), which will then find every
snapshot in the context to be new and will therefore call
rbd_register_snap_dev() via __rbd_add_snap_dev() accomplishing
the same thing.
