mm/slab: restructure kmem_cache_create() debug checks

kmem_cache_create() does cache integrity checks when CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is
defined.  These checks interspersed with the regular code path has lead
to compile time warnings when compiled without CONFIG_DEBUG_VM defined.
Restructuring the code to move the integrity checks in to a new function
would eliminate the current compile warning problem and also will allow
for future changes to the debug only code to evolve without introducing
new warnings in the regular path.

This restructuring work is based on the discussion in the following
thread:
