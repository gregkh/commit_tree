[media] au8522: Fix off-by-one in SNR table for QAM256

The table of valid SNR values for QAM 256 is off by one, and as a result
if the SNR is oscillating between 40.0 and 39.9 dB, tools like azap show
it going back and forth between 40.0 and 0 (misleading some people,
including myself, to think signal lock is being lost or there is a
problem with register reads).

Fix the table so that 40.0 dB is properly represented.
