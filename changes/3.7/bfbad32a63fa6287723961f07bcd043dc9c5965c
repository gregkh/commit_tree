ARM: pxa: armcore: fix PCI PIO warnings

The it8152 PCI host used on the pxa/cm_x2xx machines
uses the old-style I/O window registration. This should
eventually get converted to pci_ioremap_io() but for
now, let's cast the IT8152_IO_BASE constant to an integer
type to get rid of the warnings.

Without this patch, building cm_x2xx_defconfig results in:

arch/arm/common/it8152.c: In function 'it8152_pci_setup':
arch/arm/common/it8152.c:287:18: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast [enabled by default]
arch/arm/common/it8152.c:288:16: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast [enabled by default]
arch/arm/common/it8152.c:291:17: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast [enabled by default]
