ARM: config: sort select statements alphanumerically

As suggested by Andrew Morton:

  This is a pet peeve of mine.  Any time there's a long list of items
  (header file inclusions, kconfig entries, array initalisers, etc) and
  someone wants to add a new item, they *always* go and stick it at the
  end of the list.

  Guys, don't do this.  Either put the new item into a randomly-chosen
  position or, probably better, alphanumerically sort the list.

lets sort all our select statements alphanumerically.  This commit was
created by the following perl:

while (<>) {
	while (/\\\s*$/) {
		$_ .= <>;
	}
	undef %selects if /^\s*config\s+/;
	if (/^\s+select\s+(\w+).*/) {
		if (defined($selects{$1})) {
			if ($selects{$1} eq $_) {
				print STDERR "Warning: removing duplicated $1 entry\n";
			} else {
				print STDERR "Error: $1 differently selected\n".
					"\tOld: $selects{$1}\n".
					"\tNew: $_\n";
				exit 1;
			}
		}
		$selects{$1} = $_;
		next;
	}
	if (%selects and (/^\s*$/ or /^\s+help/ or /^\s+---help---/ or
			  /^endif/ or /^endchoice/)) {
		foreach $k (sort (keys %selects)) {
			print "$selects{$k}";
		}
		undef %selects;
	}
	print;
}
if (%selects) {
	foreach $k (sort (keys %selects)) {
		print "$selects{$k}";
	}
}

It found two duplicates:

Warning: removing duplicated S5P_SETUP_MIPIPHY entry
Warning: removing duplicated HARDIRQS_SW_RESEND entry

and they are identical duplicates, hence the shrinkage in the diffstat
of two lines.

We have four testers reporting success of this change (Tony, Stephen,
Linus and Sekhar.)
