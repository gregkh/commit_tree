Btrfs: fix our overcommit math

I noticed I was seeing large lags when running my torrent test in a vm on my
laptop.  While trying to make it lag less I noticed that our overcommit math
was taking into account the number of bytes we wanted to reclaim, not the
number of bytes we actually wanted to allocate, which means we wouldn't
overcommit as often.  This patch fixes the overcommit math and makes
shrink_delalloc() use that logic so that it will stop looping faster.  We
still have pretty high spikes of latency, but the test now takes 3 minutes
less time (about 5% faster).  Thanks,
