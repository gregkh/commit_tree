IB/core: Reserve bits in enum ib_qp_create_flags for low-level driver use

Reserve bits 26-31 for internal use by low-level drivers. Two such
bits are used in the mlx4_b driver SR-IOV implementation.

These enum additions guarantee that the core layer will never use
these bits, so that low level drivers may safely make use of them.
