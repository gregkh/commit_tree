KVM: introduce gfn_to_hva_read/kvm_read_hva/kvm_read_hva_atomic

This set of functions is only used to read data from host space, in the
later patch, we will only get a readonly hva in gfn_to_hva_read, and
the function name is a good hint to let gfn_to_hva_read to pair with
kvm_read_hva()/kvm_read_hva_atomic()
