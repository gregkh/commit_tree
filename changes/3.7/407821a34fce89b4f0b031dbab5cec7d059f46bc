powerpc: Initialise paca.data_offset with poison

It's possible for the cpu_possible_mask to change between the time we
initialise the pacas and the time we setup per_cpu areas.

Obviously impossible cpus shouldn't ever be running, but stranger things
have happened. So be paranoid and initialise data_offset with a poison
value in case we don't set it up later.

Based on a patch from Anton Blanchard.
