ASoC: kirkwood-i2s: fix DCO lock detection

This is part of a patch found in Rabeeh Khoury's git tree for the
cubox, which is further attributed to Sebastian Hesselbrath.

Rather than masking the KIRKWOOD_DCO_SPCR_STATUS register contents
against the registers virtual address, let's actually use the bit
definition for the locked status, as required in the documentation.
