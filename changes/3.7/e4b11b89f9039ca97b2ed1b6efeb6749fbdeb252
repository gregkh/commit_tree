qla2xxx: Fix endianness of task management response code

The qla2xxx firmware actually expects the task management response
code in a CTIO IOCB with SCSI status mode 1 to be in little-endian
byte order, ie the response code should be the first byte in the
sense_data[] array.  The old code erroneously byte-swapped the
response code, which puts it in the wrong place on the wire and leads
to initiators thinking every task management request succeeds (since
they see 0 in the byte where they look for the response code).
