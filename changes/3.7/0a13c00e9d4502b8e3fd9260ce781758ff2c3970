workqueue: reorder queueing functions so that _on() variants are on top

Currently, queue/schedule[_delayed]_work_on() are located below the
counterpart without the _on postifx even though the latter is usually
implemented using the former.  Swap them.

This is cleanup and doesn't cause any functional difference.
