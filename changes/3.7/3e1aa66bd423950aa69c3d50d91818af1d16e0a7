lib/kasprintf.c: use kmalloc_track_caller() to get accurate traces for kvasprintf

Previously kvasprintf() allocation was being done through kmalloc(),
thus producing an inaccurate trace report.

This is a common problem: in order to get accurate callsite tracing, a
lib/utils function shouldn't allocate kmalloc but instead use
kmalloc_track_caller.
