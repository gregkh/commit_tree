virtio_mmio: fix off by one error allocating queue

vm_setup_vq fails to allow VirtQueues needing only 2 pages of
storage, as it should. Found with a kernel using 64kB pages, but
can be provoked if a virtio device reports QueueNumMax where the
descriptor table and available ring fit in one page, and the used
ring on the second (<= 227 descriptors with 4kB pages and <= 3640
with 64kB pages.)
