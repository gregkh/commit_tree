kernel/resource.c: fix stack overflow in __reserve_region_with_split()

Using a recursive call add a non-conflicting region in
__reserve_region_with_split() could result in a stack overflow in the case
that the recursive calls are too deep.  Convert the recursive calls to an
iterative loop to avoid the problem.

Tested on a machine containing 135 regions.  The kernel no longer panicked
with stack overflow.

Also tested with code arbitrarily adding regions with no conflict,
embedding two consecutive conflicts and embedding two non-consecutive
conflicts.
