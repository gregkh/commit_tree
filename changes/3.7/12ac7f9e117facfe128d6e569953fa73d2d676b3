ARM: AM33XX: Fix configuration of dmtimer parent clock by dmtimer driverDate:Wed, 17 Oct 2012 13:55:55 -0500

Add dmtimer clock aliases for AM33XX devices so that the parent clock for
the dmtimer can be set correctly by the dmtimer driver. Without these clock
aliases the dmtimer driver will fail to find the parent clocks for the dmtimer.

Verified that DMTIMERs can be successfully requested on AM335x beagle bone.

Original patch was provided by Vaibhav Hiremath [1]. Changelog and
additional verification performed by Jon Hunter.
