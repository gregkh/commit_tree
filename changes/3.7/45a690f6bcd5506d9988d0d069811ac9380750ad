ASoC: wm8994: Add bytes controls for DRC

If DRC coefficients are not configured via platform data then add bytes
controls for them instead so they can be configured by applications. This
is the normal means of controlling things like this for newer systems, we
maintain compatibility with platform data to avoid disruption to existing
systems.
