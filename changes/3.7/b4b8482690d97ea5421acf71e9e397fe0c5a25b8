spi/pl022: Fix chipselects pointer computation

The new chip select handling via GPIO introduced a pointer computation bug:

	(int *) pl022 + sizeof(struct pl022)

doesn't point to the data immediately after the actual struct pl022 (as was
intended) but to a multiple of bytes after it because of the (int *) type.

Replacing the kludgy pointer arithmetic with managed memory allocation for the
chip selects.
