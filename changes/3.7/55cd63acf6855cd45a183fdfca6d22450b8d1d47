OMAPDSS: DSI: Update manager timings on a manual update

During a command mode update using DISPC video port, we may need to swap the
connected overlay manager's width and height when 90 or 270 degree rotation is
done via the panel by changing it's address mode.

Call dss_mgr_set_timings() in update_screen_dispc() before starting the manager
update. The new manager size is updated in the 'timings' field of DSI driver's
private data via omapdss_dsi_set_size(). A panel driver is expected to call this
when performing rotation.
