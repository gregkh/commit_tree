ring-buffer: Check for uninitialized cpu buffer before resizing

With a system where, num_present_cpus < num_possible_cpus, even if all
CPUs are online, non-present CPUs don't have per_cpu buffers allocated.
If per_cpu/<cpu>/buffer_size_kb is modified for such a CPU, it can cause
a panic due to NULL dereference in ring_buffer_resize().

To fix this, resize operation is allowed only if the per-cpu buffer has
been initialized.
