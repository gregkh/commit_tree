igb: Use dma_unmap_addr and dma_unmap_len defines

This change is meant to improve performance on systems that do not require
the DMA unmap calls.  On those systems we do not need to make use of the
unmap address for Tx or the unmap length so we can drop both thereby
reducing the size of the Tx buffer info structure.

In addition I have changed the logic to check for unmap length instead of
unmap address when checking to see if a buffer needs to be unmapped from
DMA use.  The reasons for this change is that on some platforms it is
possible to receive a valid DMA address of 0 from an IOMMU.
