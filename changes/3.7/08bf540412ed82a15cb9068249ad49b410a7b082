xfs: make inode64 as the default allocation mode

since 64-bit inodes can be accessed while using inode32, and these can
also be used on 32-bit kernels, there is no reason to still keep inode32
as the default mount option.  If the filesystem cannot handle 64bit
inode numbers (i.e CONFIG_LBDAF is not enabled and BITS_PER_LONG == 32),
XFS_MOUNT_SMALL_INUMS will still be set by default, so inode64 is not an
unconditional default value.
