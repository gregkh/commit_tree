firmware loader: fix compile warning when CONFIG_PM=n

This patch replaces the previous macro of CONFIG_PM with
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP becasue firmware cache is only used in
system sleep situations.

Also this patch fixes the below compile warning when
CONFIG_PM=n:

	drivers/base/firmware_class.c:1147: warning: 'device_cache_fw_images'
	defined but not used
	drivers/base/firmware_class.c:1212: warning:
	'device_uncache_fw_images_delay' defined but not used
