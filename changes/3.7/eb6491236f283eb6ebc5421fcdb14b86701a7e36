DM RAID: Move 'rebuild' checking code to its own function

DM RAID:  Move chunk of code to it's own function

The code that checks whether device replacements/rebuilds are possible given
a specific RAID type is moved to it's own function.  It will further expand
when the code to check RAID10 is added.  A separate function makes it easier
to read.
