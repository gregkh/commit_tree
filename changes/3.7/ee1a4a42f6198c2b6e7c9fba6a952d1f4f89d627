[SCSI] bfa: FCS remote port enhancements.

- Introduced rport qualifier structure and modified design to
  export remote ports with valid pid or valid pwwn to the user space.
- Introduced old_pid field in the rport structure and made changes to
  prevent re-creating a new remote port for an already existing rport
  that is transitioning to a delete state. (Happens if we receive a RSCN
  on the existing remote port that is getting deleted).
