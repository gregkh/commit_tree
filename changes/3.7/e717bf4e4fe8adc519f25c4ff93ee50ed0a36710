perf/x86: Add support for Intel Xeon-Phi Knights Corner PMU

The following patch adds perf_event support for the Xeon-Phi
PMU, as documented in the "Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor (codename:
Knights Corner) Performance Monitoring Units" manual.

Even though it is a co-processor, a Phi runs a full Linux
environment and can support performance counters.

This is just barebones support, it does not add support for
interesting new features such as the SPFLT intruction that
allows starting/stopping events without entering the kernel.

The PMU internally is just like that of an original Pentium, but
a "P6-like" MSR interface is provided.  The interface is
different enough from a real P6 that it's not easy (or
practical) to re-use the code in  perf_event_p6.c
