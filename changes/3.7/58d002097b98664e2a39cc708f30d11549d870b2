mm: compaction: fix return value of capture_free_page()

Commit ef6c5be658f6 ("fix incorrect NR_FREE_PAGES accounting (appears
like memory leak)") fixes a NR_FREE_PAGE accounting leak but missed the
return value which was also missed by this reviewer until today.

That return value is used by compaction when adding pages to a list of
isolated free pages and without this follow-up fix, there is a risk of
free list corruption.
