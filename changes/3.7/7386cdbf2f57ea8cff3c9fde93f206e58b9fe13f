nohz: Fix idle ticks in cpu summary line of /proc/stat

Git commit 09a1d34f8535ecf9 "nohz: Make idle/iowait counter update
conditional" introduced a bug in regard to cpu hotplug. The effect is
that the number of idle ticks in the cpu summary line in /proc/stat is
still counting ticks for offline cpus.

Reproduction is easy, just start a workload that keeps all cpus busy,
switch off one or more cpus and then watch the idle field in top.
On a dual-core with one cpu 100% busy and one offline cpu you will get
something like this:

%Cpu(s): 48.7 us,  1.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 50.0 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,
%0.0 st

The problem is that an offline cpu still has ts->idle_active == 1.
To fix this we should make sure that the cpu is online when calling
get_cpu_idle_time_us and get_cpu_iowait_time_us.
