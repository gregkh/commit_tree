ALSA: hda - Fix hang caused by race during suspend.

There was a race condition when the system suspends while hda_power_work
is running in the work queue.  If system suspend (snd_hda_suspend)
happens after the work queue releases power_lock but before it calls
hda_call_codec_suspend,  codec_suspend runs with power_on=0, causing the
codec to power up for register reads, and hanging when it calls
cancel_delayed_work_sync from the running work queue.

The call chain from the work queue will look like this:
hda_power_work <<- power_on = 1, unlock, then power_on cleard by suspend
  hda_call_codec_suspend
    hda_set_power_state
      snd_hda_codec_read
        codec_exec_verb
          snd_hda_power_up
	    snd_hda_power_save
	      __snd_hda_power_up
	        cancel_delayed_work_sync <<-- cancelling executing wq

Fix this by waiting for the work queue to finish before starting suspend
if suspend is not happening on the work queue.
