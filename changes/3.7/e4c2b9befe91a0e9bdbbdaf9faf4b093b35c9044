m68knommu: modify ColdFire 532x GPIO register definitions to be consistent

The ColdFire 532x CPU register definitions for the multi-function setup
pins are inconsistently defined compared with other ColdFire parts. Modify
the register defintions to be just the addresses, not pointers. This also
fixes the erroneous use in one case of using these values in the UART setup
code for the 532x.
