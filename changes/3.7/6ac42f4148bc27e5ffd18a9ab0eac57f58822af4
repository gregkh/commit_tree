drm/i915: Replace the complex flushing logic with simple invalidate/flush all

Now that we unconditionally flush and invalidate between every batch
buffer, we no longer need the complex logic to decide which domains
require flushing. Remove it and rejoice.

v2 (danvet): Keep around the flip waiting logic. It's gross and
broken, I know, but we can't just kill that thing ... even if we just
keep it around as a reminder that things are broken.
