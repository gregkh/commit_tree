mmc: mxs-mmc: Fix merge issue causing build error

The following error appeared due to a merge problem; the patches:

fc108d24 "mmc: mxs-mmc: fix deadlock caused by recursion loop"
829c1bf4 "mmc: spi: Pull out parts shared between MMC and SPI"

came in through separate branches and cause this build error when
combined.

drivers/mmc/host/mxs-mmc.c: In function 'mxs_mmc_enable_sdio_irq':
drivers/mmc/host/mxs-mmc.c:527:3: error: 'struct mxs_mmc_host' has no member named 'base'
drivers/mmc/host/mxs-mmc.c:527:3: error: 'struct mxs_mmc_host' has no member named 'devid'
make[3]: *** [drivers/mmc/host/mxs-mmc.o] Error 1

This patch corrects the issue.
