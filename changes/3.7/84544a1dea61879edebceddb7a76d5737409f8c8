PCI: Fix default vga ref_count

when __ARCH_HAS_VGA_DEFAULT_DEVICE is not defined, aka EFIFB is not used,
for static path, vga_default setting is through vga_arbiter_add_pci_device.
and later x86 pci_fixup_video, will skip setting again.
- subsys_initcall(vga_arb_device_init) come first to call
vga_arbiter_add_pci_device. It will call pci_get_dev to hold one reference.

for hotplug add path, even vga_arbiter_add_pci_device is called via
notifier, but it will check VGA_RSRC_LEGACY_MASK that is not set for
hotplug path.  So x86 pci_fixup_video will take over to call
vga_set_default_device().  It will not hold one refrence.

Later for hotplug remove path, vga_arbiter_del_pci_device that does not
check VGA_RSRC_LEGACY_MASK will call put_device and it will cause ref_count
to decrease extra. that will have that pci device get deleted early
wrongly.

Need to make get/put balance for both cases.
