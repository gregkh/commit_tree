This turns out to be correct and we need to pay attention to the pgoff as
well as the address when creating the virtual address for the area.
Fortunately, the bug is rarely triggered as most applications which use pgoff
tend to use large values (git being the primary one, and it uses pgoff in
multiples of 16MB) which are larger than our cache coherency modulus, so the
problem isn't often seen in practise.
