ARM: 7539/1: kexec: scan for dtb magic in segments

This patch allows a dtb to be passed to a new kernel using the kexec
mechinism.

When loading segments from userspace, scan each segment's first four
bytes for the dtb magic. If this is found set the kexec_boot_atags
parameter to the relocate_kernel code to the phyical address of this
segment.
