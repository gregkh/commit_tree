rcu: Reduce synchronize_rcu_expedited() latency

The synchronize_rcu_expedited() function disables interrupts across a
scan of all leaf rcu_node structures, which is not good for real-time
scheduling latency on large systems (hundreds or especially thousands
of CPUs).  This commit therefore holds off CPU-hotplug operations using
get_online_cpus(), and removes the prior acquisiion of the ->onofflock
(which required disabling interrupts).
