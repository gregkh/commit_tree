mmc: dw_mmc: add quirk to indicate missing write protect line

If the write protect pad of the controller is not connected to the write
protect pin of the slot, the driver should be notified of this condition
so that incorrect check for write protection by reading the WRTORT
register can avoided. The get_ro platform callback can be used for in
such cases, but with device tree support enabled, such platform callbacks
cannot be supported.

Add a new quirk for notifying the driver about the missing write protect
line so the driver can assume that the card write protection is disabled.
