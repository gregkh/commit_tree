tmpfs: fix shmem_getpage_gfp() VM_BUG_ON

Fuzzing with trinity hit the "impossible" VM_BUG_ON(error) (which Fedora
has converted to WARNING) in shmem_getpage_gfp():

  WARNING: at mm/shmem.c:1151 shmem_getpage_gfp+0xa5c/0xa70()

Thanks to Johannes for pointing to truncation: free_swap_and_cache()
only does a trylock on the page, so the page lock we've held since
before confirming swap is not enough to protect against truncation.

What cleanup is needed in this case? Just delete_from_swap_cache(),
which takes care of the memcg uncharge.
