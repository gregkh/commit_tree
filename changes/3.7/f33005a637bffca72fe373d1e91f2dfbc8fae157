igb: Remove logic that was doing NUMA pseudo-aware allocations

This change removes the code that was doing the NUMA allocations for the
q_vectors, rings, and ring resources.  The problem is the logic used assumed
that the NUMA nodes were always interleved and that is not always the case.

At some point I hope to add this functionality back in a more controlled
manner in the future.
