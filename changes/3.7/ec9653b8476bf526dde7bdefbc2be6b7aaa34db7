ARM: add infra-structure for BCM2835 and Raspberry Pi

The BCM2835 is an ARM SoC from Broadcom. This patch adds very basic
support for this SoC.

Note that the documentation in the latter .pdf assumes the MMU setup
that's used on the "VideoCore" companion processor, and does not document
physical peripheral addresses. Subtract 0x5e000000 to obtain the physical
addresses. This is accounted for by the ranges property in the /soc node
in the device tree.

The BCM2835 SoC is used in the Raspberry Pi. This patch also adds a
minimal device tree for this board; enough to see some very early kernel
boot messages through earlyprintk. However, this patch does not yet
provide a useful booting system.

This patch was extracted from git://github.com/lp0/linux.git branch
rpi-split from 3-4 months ago, and significantly stripped down and
modified since.
