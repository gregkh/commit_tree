ARM: LPC32xx: Platform update for devicetree completion of spi-pl022

spi-pl022 got a further update to its devicetree support, completing properties
such that no platform data is necessary anymore. This patch adjusts phy3250.c
accordingly: The supplied platform data is deleted. However, OF_DEV_AUXDATA()
are still necessary due to device naming ("dev:ssp0").
