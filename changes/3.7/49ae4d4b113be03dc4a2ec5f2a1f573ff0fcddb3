coredump: add a new elf note with siginfo of the signal

Existing PRSTATUS note contains only si_signo, si_code, si_errno fields
from the siginfo of the signal which caused core to be dumped.

There are tools which try to analyze crashes for possible security
implications, and they want to use, among other data, si_addr field from
the SIGSEGV.

This patch adds a new elf note, NT_SIGINFO, which contains the complete
siginfo_t of the signal which killed the process.
