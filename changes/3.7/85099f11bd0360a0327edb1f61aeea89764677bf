Revert "OMAPDSS: APPLY: add fifo merge support funcs"

This reverts commit fb0119742291b6f30cd97026ee137b2d3d1f4de8.

Adding fifo merge feature as an omapdss internal configuration was a
mistake. We cannot hide from the users of omapdss the complexities of
fifo merge.

The previous commit removed fifo merge itself, and this removes the
remaining fifo merge support functions.
