MIPS: Align swapper_pg_dir to 64K for better TLB Refill code.

We can save an instruction in the TLB Refill path for kernel mappings
by aligning swapper_pg_dir on a 64K boundary.  The address of
swapper_pg_dir can be generated with a single LUI instead of
LUI/{D}ADDUI.

The alignment of __init_end is bumped up to 64K so there are no holes
between it and swapper_pg_dir, which is placed at the very beginning
of .bss.

The alignment of invalid_pmd_table and invalid_pte_table can be
relaxed to PAGE_SIZE.  We do this by using __page_aligned_bss, which
has the added benefit of eliminating alignment holes in .bss.
