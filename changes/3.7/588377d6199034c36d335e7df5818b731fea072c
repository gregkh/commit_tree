rbd: reset BACKOFF if unable to re-queue

If ceph_fault() is unable to queue work after a delay, it sets the
BACKOFF connection flag so con_work() will attempt to do so.

In con_work(), when BACKOFF is set, if queue_delayed_work() doesn't
result in newly-queued work, it simply ignores this condition and
proceeds as if no backoff delay were desired.  There are two
problems with this--one of which is a bug.

The first problem is simply that the intended behavior is to back
off, and if we aren't able queue the work item to run after a delay
we're not doing that.

The only reason queue_delayed_work() won't queue work is if the
provided work item is already queued.  In the messenger, this
means that con_work() is already scheduled to be run again.  So
if we simply set the BACKOFF flag again when this occurs, we know
the next con_work() call will again attempt to hold off activity
on the connection until after the delay.

The second problem--the bug--is a leak of a reference count.  If
queue_delayed_work() returns 0 in con_work(), con->ops->put() drops
the connection reference held on entry to con_work().  However,
processing is (was) allowed to continue, and at the end of the
function a second con->ops->put() is called.

This patch fixes both problems.
