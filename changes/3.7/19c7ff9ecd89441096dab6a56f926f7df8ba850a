slub: Take node lock during object free checks

Only applies to scenarios where debugging is on:

Validation of slabs can currently occur while debugging
information is updated from the fast paths of the allocator.
This results in various races where we get false reports about
slab metadata not being in order.

This patch makes the fast paths take the node lock so that
serialization with slab validation will occur. Causes additional
slowdown in debug scenarios.
