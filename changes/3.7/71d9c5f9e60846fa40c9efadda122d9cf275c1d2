IPoIB: Fix build with CONFIG_INFINIBAND_IPOIB_CM=n

With the new netlink support in commit 862096a8bbf8 ("IB/ipoib: Add more
rtnl_link_ops callbacks") we need ipoib_set_mode() to be available even
if connected mode isn't built.  Move the function from ipoib_cm.c to
ipoib_main.c (and make a few CM-related macros available unconditonally).

This fixes the build error

    drivers/built-in.o: In function 'ipoib_changelink':
    ipoib_netlink.c:(.text+0x6a5fc9): undefined reference to 'ipoib_set_mode'
    ipoib_netlink.c:(.text+0x6a5fe3): undefined reference to 'ipoib_set_mode'

when CONFIG_INFINIBAND_IPOIB_CM isn't set.
