kprobes: Inverse taking of module_mutex with kprobe_mutex

Currently module_mutex is taken before kprobe_mutex, but this
can cause issues when we have kprobes register ftrace, as the ftrace
mutex is taken before enabling a tracepoint, which currently takes
the module mutex.

If module_mutex is taken before kprobe_mutex, then we can not
have kprobes use the ftrace infrastructure.

There seems to be no reason that the kprobe_mutex can't be taken
before the module_mutex. Running lockdep shows that it is safe
among the kernels I've run.
