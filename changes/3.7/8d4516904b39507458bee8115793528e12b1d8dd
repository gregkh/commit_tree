watchdog: Fix CPU hotplug regression

Norbert reported:
"3.7-rc6 booted with nmi_watchdog=0 fails to suspend to RAM or
 offline CPUs. It's reproducable with a KVM guest and physical
 system."

The reason is that commit bcd951cf(watchdog: Use hotplug thread
infrastructure) missed to take this into account. So the cpu offline
code gets stuck in the teardown function because it accesses non
initialized data structures.

Add a check for watchdog_enabled into that path to cure the issue.
