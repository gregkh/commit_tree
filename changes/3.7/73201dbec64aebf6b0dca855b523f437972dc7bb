x86, suspend: On wakeup always initialize cr4 and EFER

We already have a flag word to indicate the existence of MISC_ENABLES,
so use the same flag word to indicate existence of cr4 and EFER, and
always restore them if they exist.  That way if something passes a
nonzero value when the value *should* be zero, we will still
initialize it.
