workqueue: use cwq_set_max_active() helper for workqueue_set_max_active()

workqueue_set_max_active() may increase ->max_active without
activating delayed works and may make the activation order differ from
the queueing order.  Both aren't strictly bugs but the resulting
behavior could be a bit odd.

To make things more consistent, use cwq_set_max_active() helper which
immediately makes use of the newly increased max_mactive if there are
delayed work items and also keeps the activation order.

tj: Slight update to description.
