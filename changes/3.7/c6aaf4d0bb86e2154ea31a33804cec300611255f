kprobes/x86: Fix to support jprobes on ftrace-based kprobe

Fix kprobes/x86 to support jprobes on ftrace-based kprobes.
Because of -mfentry support of ftrace, ftrace is now put
on the beginning of function where jprobes are put.

Originally ftrace-based kprobes doesn't support jprobe
because it will change regs->ip and ftrace doesn't support
changing IP and ftrace itself doesn't conflict jprobe.
However, ftrace -mfentry support moves mcount call on the
top of functions where jprobes are put. This means that
jprobe always conflicts with ftrace-based kprobe and fails.

This patch allows ftrace-based kprobes to support jprobes
by allowing to modify regs->ip and kprobes breakpoint
handler also allows to skip singlestepping because there
is a ftrace call (not an original instruction).
