[media] Kconfig: Fix dependencies for driver autoselect options

This option is a merge of both analog TV and DVB CUSTOMISE.

At the merge, the dependencies were not done right: the menu
currently appears only for analog TV. It should also be opened
for digital TV. As there are other I2C devices there (flash
devices, etc) that aren't related to either one, it is better
to make it generic enough to open for all media devices with
video.
