staging: comedi: ni_daq_700: fix dio subdevice regression

Here is a small patch to fix a problem caused by a previous patch that
removed the  callback function.  The callback remove patch:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=1de02225358988e8fd48d1dc3fd12336bbae258a

I finally booted my dev machine on the latest kernel (running Debian
here so it's still on 3.2 normally) to test the ni_daq_700 driver with
my test program and noticed this bug.

Shift the DIO_R read result to bits 8..15 Digital direction
configuration: channels 0-7 output, 8-15 input (8225 device emu as port
A output, port B input, port C N/A).
