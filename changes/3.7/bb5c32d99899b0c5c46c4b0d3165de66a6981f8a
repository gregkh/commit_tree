HID: picoLCD: drop version check during probe

Commit 4ea5454203d991ec85264f64f89ca8855fce69b0
[HID: Fix race condition between driver core and ll-driver] introduced
new locking around probe/remove functions that prevents any report/reply
from hardware to reach driver until it returned from probe.

As such, the ask-reply way to checking picoLCD firmware version during
probe is bound to timeout and let probe fail.

Drop the check to let driver successfully probe again (until locking issues
are resolved allowing to reinstate the check).
