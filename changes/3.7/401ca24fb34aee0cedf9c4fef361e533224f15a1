HID: sensors: introduce sensor framework

Adding processing for HID Sensor usage table as defined by
HID 1.12, Request #: HUTRR39, dated 05 May, 2011.
This driver uses HID driver framework to register, send and
receive events.
This uses MFD framework, so that actual processing for a
specific usage id can be done in a different driver. For
example an accelerometer driver can be a separate driver and
use the interface provided by this driver to register for
events.
