Revert "mm: avoid waking kswapd for THP allocations when compaction is deferred or contended"

This reverts commit 782fd30406ecb9d9b082816abe0c6008fc72a7b0.

We are going to reinstate the __GFP_NO_KSWAPD flag that has been
removed, the removal reverted, and then removed again.  Making this
commit a pointless fixup for a problem that was caused by the removal of
__GFP_NO_KSWAPD flag.

The thing is, we really don't want to wake up kswapd for THP allocations
(because they fail quite commonly under any kind of memory pressure,
including when there is tons of memory free), and these patches were
just trying to fix up the underlying bug: the original removal of
__GFP_NO_KSWAPD in commit c654345924f7 ("mm: remove __GFP_NO_KSWAPD")
was simply bogus.
