ARM: add coherent dma ops

arch_is_coherent is problematic as it is a global symbol. This
doesn't work for multi-platform kernels or platforms which can support
per device coherent DMA.

This adds arm_coherent_dma_ops to be used for devices which connected
coherently (i.e. to the ACP port on Cortex-A9 or A15). The arm_dma_ops
are modified at boot when arch_is_coherent is true.
