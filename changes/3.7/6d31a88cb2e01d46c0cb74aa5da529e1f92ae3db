tty: revert incorrectly applied lock patch

I sent GregKH this after the pre-requisites. He dropped the pre-requesites
for good reason and unfortunately then applied this patch. Without this
reverted you get random kernel memory corruption which will make bisecting
anything between it and the properly applied patches a complete sod.
