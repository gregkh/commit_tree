arm64: Process management

The patch adds support for thread creation and context switching. The
context switching CPU specific code is introduced with the CPU support
patch (part of the arch/arm64/mm/proc.S file). AArch64 supports
ASID-tagged TLBs and the ASID can be either 8 or 16-bit wide (detectable
via the ID_AA64AFR0_EL1 register).
