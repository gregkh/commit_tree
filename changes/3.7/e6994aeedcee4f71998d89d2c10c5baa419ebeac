drm/i915: Export ability of changing cache levels to userspace

By selecting the cache level (essentially whether or not the CPU snoops
any updates to the bo, and on more recent machines whether it resides
inside the CPU's last-level-cache) a userspace driver is able to then
manage all of its memory within buffer objects, if it so desires. This
enables the userspace driver to accelerate uploads and more importantly
downloads from the GPU and to able to mix CPU and GPU rendering/activity
efficiently.

specific cacheing control bits in the ioctl struct.]
