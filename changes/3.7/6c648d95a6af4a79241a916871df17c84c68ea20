[SCSI] st: get rid of scsi_tapes array

st currently allocates an array to store pointers to all of the
scsi_tape objects. It's used to discover available indexes to use as the
base for the minor number selection and later to look up scsi_tape
devices for character devices.

We switch to using an IDR for minor selection and a pointer from
st_modedef back to scsi_tape for the lookups.
