xen/swiotlb: Use the swiotlb_late_init_with_tbl to init Xen-SWIOTLB late when PV PCI is used.

With this patch we provide the functionality to initialize the
Xen-SWIOTLB late in the bootup cycle - specifically for
Xen PCI-frontend. We still will work if the user had
supplied 'iommu=soft' on the Linux command line.

Note: We cannot depend on after_bootmem to automatically
determine whether this is early or not. This is because
when PCI IOMMUs are initialized it is after after_bootmem but
before a lot of "other" subsystems are initialized.
