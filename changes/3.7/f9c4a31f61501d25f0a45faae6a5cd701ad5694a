gpiolib: Use seq_file's iterator interface

When dumping a collection of items via seq_file, it is recommended to
use the iterator interface. For the gpiolib debugfs interface this can
be done to dump each GPIO chip in turn.

Note that for gpiolib this is a little cumbersome because it does not
provide a list of registered GPIO chips and the only way to iterate is
over each GPIO individually. Once a chip is found, the number of GPIOs
it provides can be skipped as a small optimization.
