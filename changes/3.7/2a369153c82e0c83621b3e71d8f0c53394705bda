NFS: Clean up helper function nfs4_select_rw_stateid()

We want to be able to pass on the information that the page was not
dirtied under a lock. Instead of adding a flag parameter, do this
by passing a pointer to a 'struct nfs_lock_owner' that may be NULL.

Also reuse this structure in struct nfs_lock_context to carry the
fl_owner_t and pid_t.
