cifs: Do not lookup hashed negative dentry in cifs_atomic_open

We do not need to lookup a hashed negative directory since we have
already revalidated it before and have found it to be fine.

This also prevents a crash in cifs_lookup() when it attempts to rehash
the already hashed negative lookup dentry.

The patch has been tested using the reproducer at
