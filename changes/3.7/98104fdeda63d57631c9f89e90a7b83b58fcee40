cfg80211: add P2P Device abstraction

In order to support using a different MAC address
for the P2P Device address we must first have a
P2P Device abstraction that can be assigned a MAC
address.

This abstraction will also be useful to support
offloading P2P operations to the device, e.g.
periodic listen for discoverability.

Currently, the driver is responsible for assigning
a MAC address to the P2P Device, but this could be
changed by allowing a MAC address to be given to
the NEW_INTERFACE command.

As it has no associated netdev, a P2P Device can
only be identified by its wdev identifier but the
previous patches allowed using the wdev identifier
in various APIs, e.g. remain-on-channel.
