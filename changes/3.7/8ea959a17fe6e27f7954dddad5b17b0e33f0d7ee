cpuidle/powerpc: Fix smt_snooze_delay functionality.

smt_snooze_delay was designed to  delay idle loop's nap entry
in the native idle code before it got  ported over to use as part of
the cpuidle framework.

A -ve value  assigned to smt_snooze_delay should result in
busy looping, in other words disabling the entry to nap state.

This particular functionality can be achieved currently by
echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/state1/disable
but it is broken when one assigns -ve value to  the smt_snooze_delay
variable either via sysfs entry or ppc64_cpu util.

This patch aims to fix this, by disabling nap state when smt_snooze_delay
variable is set to -ve value.
