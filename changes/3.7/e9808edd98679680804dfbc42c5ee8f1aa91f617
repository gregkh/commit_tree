drm/i915: Return a mask of the active rings in the high word of busy_ioctl

The intention is to help select which engine to use for copies with
interoperating clients - such as a GL client making a request to the X
server to perform a SwapBuffers, which may require copying from the
active GL back buffer to the X front buffer.

We choose to report a mask of the active rings to future proof the
interface against any changes which may allow for the object to reside
upon multiple rings.

[danvet: bikeshed away the write ring mask and add the explanation
Chris sent in a follow-up mail why we decided to use masks.]
