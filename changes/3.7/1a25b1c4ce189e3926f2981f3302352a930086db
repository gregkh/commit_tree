Lock splice_read and splice_write functions

Functions generic_file_splice_read and generic_file_splice_write access
the pagecache directly. For block devices these functions must be locked
so that block size is not changed while they are in progress.

This patch is an additional fix for commit b87570f5d349 ("Fix a crash
when block device is read and block size is changed at the same time")
that locked aio_read, aio_write and mmap against block size change.
