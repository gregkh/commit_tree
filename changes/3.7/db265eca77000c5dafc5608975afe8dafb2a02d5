mm/sl[aou]b: Move duping of slab name to slab_common.c

Duping of the slabname has to be done by each slab. Moving this code to
slab_common avoids duplicate implementations.

With this patch we have common string handling for all slab allocators.
Strings passed to kmem_cache_create() are copied internally. Subsystems
can create temporary strings to create slab caches.

Slabs allocated in early states of bootstrap will never be freed (and
those can never be freed since they are essential to slab allocator
operations).  During bootstrap we therefore do not have to worry about
duping names.
