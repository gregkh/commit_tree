ipv4: Minor logic clean-up in ipv4_mtu

In ipv4_mtu there is some logic where we are testing for a non-zero value
and a timer expiration, then setting the value to zero, and then testing if
the value is zero we set it to a value based on the dst.  Instead of
bothering with the extra steps it is easier to just cleanup the logic so
that we set it to the dst based value if it is zero or if the timer has
expired.
