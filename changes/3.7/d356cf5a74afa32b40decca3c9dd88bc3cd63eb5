Dove: Fix irq_to_pmu()

PMU interrupts start at IRQ_DOVE_PMU_START, not IRQ_DOVE_PMU_START + 1.
Fix the condition.  (It may have been less likely to occur had the code
been written "if (irq >= IRQ_DOVE_PMU_START" which imho is the easier
to understand notation, and matches the normal way of thinking about
these things.)
