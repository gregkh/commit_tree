NFS: fix bug in legacy DNS resolver.

The DNS resolver's use of the sunrpc cache involves a 'ttl' number
(relative) rather that a timeout (absolute).  This confused me when
I wrote
  commit c5b29f885afe890f953f7f23424045cdad31d3e4
     "sunrpc: use seconds since boot in expiry cache"

and I managed to break it.  The effect is that any TTL is interpreted
as 0, and nothing useful gets into the cache.

This patch removes the use of get_expiry() - which really expects an
expiry time - and uses get_uint() instead, treating the int correctly
as a ttl.

This fixes a regression that has been present since 2.6.37, causing
certain NFS accesses in certain environments to incorrectly fail.
