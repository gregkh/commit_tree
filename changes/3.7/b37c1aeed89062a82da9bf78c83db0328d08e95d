staging: comedi: 8255_pci: move ni_pcidio 8255 board support

The 8255 based boards in the ni_pcidio driver are all simple
memory mapped 8255 boards that don't require the dma support
provided by the mite driver.

Move the support for these boards from the ni_pcidio driver to
the generic 8255_pci driver.
