spi/pl022: Revert recent runtime PM changes

[Originally sent by Ulf as two changes, squashed down into one with a
redone changelog, thanks to Russell King for analysis. -- broonie]

This reverts commit 688723 (spi/pl022: enable runtime PM) and commit
2fb30d (spi/pl022: fix spi-pl022 pm enable at probe).

Commit "spi/pl022: enable runtime PM" introduced runtime PM issues as it
interacted badly with the work Russell King had done to move core
runtime PM handling into the bus.  Due to that commit, "spi/pl022: fix
spi-pl022 pm enable at probe" was merged to fix part of those issues.

Instead of adding another fix, let's clean up and revert everything
back to when it was already fine.
