iommu/amd: Split device table initialization into irq and dma part

When the IOMMU is enabled very early (as with irq-remapping)
some devices are still in BIOS hand. When dma is blocked
early this can cause lots of IO_PAGE_FAULTs. So delay the
DMA initialization and do it right before the dma_ops are
initialized.
To be secure, block all interrupts by default when irq-remapping is
enabled in the system. They will be reenabled on demand
later. Without blocking interrupts by default devices can
issue arbitrary interrupts by sending special DMA packets to
the CPU that look like MSI messages. This is especially
dangerous when a device is assigned to a KVM guest because
the guest can then DoS the host.
