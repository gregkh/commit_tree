wlcore: configure wowlan regardless of wakeup conditions

wowlan filters should be configured in any case in suspend/resume.
This shouldn't be dependent on whether wakeup conditions are the
same for suspend and resume states. Only the FW command to
reconfigure wakeup conditions should be avoided in such a case.
