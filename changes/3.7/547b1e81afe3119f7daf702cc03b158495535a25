Fix staging driver use of VM_RESERVED

The VM_RESERVED flag was killed off in commit 314e51b9851b ("mm: kill
vma flag VM_RESERVED and mm->reserved_vm counter"), and replaced by the
proper semantic flags (eg "don't core-dump" etc).  But there was a new
use of VM_RESERVED that got missed by the merge.

Fix the remaining use of VM_RESERVED in the vfio_pci driver, replacing
the VM_RESERVED flag with VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP.
