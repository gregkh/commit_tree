usb: move children deallocation after quiescing the hub

Commit ff823c79a5c33194c2e5594f7c4686ea3547910c ("usb: move children
to struct usb_port") forgot to consider the hub_disconnect sequence,
which releases ports before quiescing the hub, which will lead to a
use-after-free, since hub_quiesce() will try to disconnect ports'
children, which are already deallocated. Simple modprobe dummy_hcd &&
rmmod dummy_hcd will illustrate the problem.

This patch moves deallocation of hub's ports after hub_quiesce() call
in hub_disconnect().
