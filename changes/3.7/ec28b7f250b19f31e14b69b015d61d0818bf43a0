UAPI: x86: Differentiate the generated UAPI and internal headers

Differentiate the generated UAPI and internal headers during generation such
that the UAPI headers can be installed elsewhere.

A later patch will use this to move the UAPI headers to:

	arch/x86/include/generated/uapi/asm/

to make them easier to handle.

A previous patch added a -I for this path.
