drm: support for rotated scanout

For drivers that can support rotated scanout, the extra parameter
checking in drm-core, while nice, tends to get confused.  To solve
this drivers can set the crtc or plane invert_dimensions field so
that the dimension checking takes into account the rotation that
the driver is performing.

v1: original
v2: remove invert_dimensions from plane, at Ville's suggestion.
    Userspace can give rotated src coordinates, so invert_dimensions
    is not required for planes.
