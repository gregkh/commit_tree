ftrace: Do not test frame pointers if -mfentry is used

The function graph has a test to check if the frame pointer is
corrupted, which can happen with various options of gcc with mcount.
But this is not an issue with -mfentry as -mfentry does not need nor use
frame pointers for function graph tracing.
