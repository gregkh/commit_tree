drm/i915/sdvo: clean up connectors on intel_sdvo_init() failures

Any failures in intel_sdvo_init() after the intel_sdvo_setup_output() call
left behind ghost connectors, attached (with a dangling pointer) to the
sdvo that has been cleaned up and freed. Properly destroy any connectors
attached to the encoder.

[danvet: added a comment to explain why we need to clean up connectors
even when sdvo_output_setup fails.]
