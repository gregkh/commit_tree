rbd: separate reading header from decoding it

Right now rbd_read_header() both reads the header object for an rbd
image and decodes its contents.  It does this repeatedly if needed,
in order to ensure a complete and intact header is obtained.

Separate this process into two steps--reading of the raw header
data (in new function, rbd_dev_v1_header_read()) and separately
decoding its contents (in rbd_header_from_disk()).  As a result,
the latter function no longer requires its allocated_snaps argument.
