wireless: ath9k-htc: only load firmware in need

It is not necessary to hold the firmware memory during the whole
driver lifetime, and obviously it does waste memory. Suppose there
are 4 ath9k-htc usb dongles working, kernel has to consume about
4*50KBytes RAM to cache firmware for all dongles. After applying the
patch, kernel only caches one single firmware image in RAM for
all ath9k-htc devices just during system suspend/resume cycle.

When system is ready for loading firmware, ath9k-htc can request
the loading from usersapce. During system resume, ath9k-htc still
can load the firmware which was cached in kernel memory before
system suspend.
