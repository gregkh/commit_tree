drm/i915: properly guard ilk ips state

The update_gfx_val function called from mark_busy wasn't taking the
mchdev_lock, as it should have. Also sprinkle a few spinlock asserts
over the code to document things better.

Things are still rather confusing, especially since a few variables
in dev_priv are used by both the gen6+ rps code and the ilk ips code.
But protected by totally different locks. Follow-on patches will clean
that up.

v2: Don't add a deadlock ... hence split up update_gfx_val into a
wrapper that grabs the lock and an internal __ variant for callsites
within intel_pm.c that already have taken the lock.

v3: Mark the internal helper as static, noticed by Ben Widawsky.

v4: Damien Lespiau had questions about the safety of the ips setup
sequence, explain in a comment why it works.
