drivers/dma/dw_dmac: make driver's endianness configurable

The dw_dmac driver was originally developed for avr32 to be used with the
Synopsys DesignWare AHB DMA controller.  Starting from 2.6.38, access to
the device's i/o memory was done with the little-endian readl/writel
functions(1)

This broke the driver for the avr32 platform, because it needs big
(native) endian accessors.  This patch makes the endianness configurable
using 'DW_DMAC_BIG_ENDIAN_IO', which will default be true for AVR32

I submitted this patch before(2) but then waited for Andy to finish other
changes to the same module(3).
