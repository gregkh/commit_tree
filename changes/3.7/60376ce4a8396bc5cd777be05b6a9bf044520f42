Btrfs: fix race in sync and freeze again

I screwed this up, there is a race between checking if there is a running
transaction and actually starting a transaction in sync where we could race
with a freezer and get ourselves into trouble.  To fix this we need to make
a new join type to only do the try lock on the freeze stuff.  If it fails
we'll return EPERM and just return from sync.  This fixes a hang Liu Bo
reported when running xfstest 68 in a loop.  Thanks,
