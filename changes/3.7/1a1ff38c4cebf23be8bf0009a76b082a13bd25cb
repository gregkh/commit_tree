target: reintroduce some obsolete SCSI-2 commands

With kernel 3.6 some obsolete SCSI-2 commands including SEEK_10 have
have been removed by commit 1fd032ee10d2816c947f5d5b9abda95e728f0a8f
"target: move code for CDB emulation".

There are still clients out there which use these old SCSI-2 commands.
This mainly happens when running VMs with legacy guest systems,
connected via SCSI command pass-through to iSCSI targets. Make them
happy and return status GOOD.

Many real SCSI disks or external iSCSI storage devices still support
these old commands. So let's make LIO backward compatible as well.

This patch adds support for the previously removed SEEK_10 and
additionally the SEEK_6 and REZERO_UNIT commands.
