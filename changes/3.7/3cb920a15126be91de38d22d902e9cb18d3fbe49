ARM: ux500: Apply tc3589x's GPIO/IRQ properties to HREF's DT

This patch ensures the tc3589x and tc3598x-gpio devices are
rightfully given interrupt controller status. We also describe
the tc3598x-gpio GPIO expander in full and specify it as a GPIO
controller. Finally we reference that the external MMC slot's
Card Detection GPIO on the HREF is located on the tc3598x-gpio
expander.
