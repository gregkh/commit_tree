tcp: TCP Fast Open Server - take SYNACK RTT after completing 3WHS

When taking SYNACK RTT samples for servers using TCP Fast Open, fix
the code to ensure that we only call tcp_valid_rtt_meas() after we
receive the ACK that completes the 3-way handshake.

Previously we were always taking an RTT sample in
tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock(). However, for TCP Fast Open connections
tcp_v4_conn_req_fastopen() calls tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock() at the time we
receive the SYN. So for TFO we must wait until tcp_rcv_state_process()
to take the RTT sample.

To fix this, we wait until after TFO calls tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock()
before we set the snt_synack timestamp, since tcp_synack_rtt_meas()
already ensures that we only take a SYNACK RTT sample if snt_synack is
non-zero. To be careful, we only take a snt_synack timestamp when
a SYNACK transmit or retransmit succeeds.
