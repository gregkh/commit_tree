HID: microsoft: fix invalid rdesc for 3k kbd

Microsoft Digital Media Keyboard 3000 has two interfaces, and the
second one has a report descriptor with a bug. The second collection
says:
05 01 -- global; usage page -- 01 -- Generic Desktop Controls
09 80 -- local; usage -- 80 -- System Control
a1 01 -- main; collection -- 01 -- application

85 03 -- global; report ID -- 03
19 00 -- local; Usage Minimum -- 00
29 ff -- local; Usage Maximum -- ff
15 00 -- global; Logical Minimum -- 0
26 ff 00 -- global; Logical Maximum -- ff
81 00 -- main; input

c0 -- main; End Collection

I.e. it makes us think that there are all kinds of usages of system
control. That the keyboard is a not only a keyboard, but also a
joystick, mouse, gamepad, keypad, etc. The same as for the Wireless
Desktop Receiver, this should be Physical Min/Max. So fix that
appropriately.
