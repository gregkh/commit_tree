cxgb4/cxgb4vf: Code cleanup to enable T4 Configuration File support

This patch adds new enums and macros to enable T4 configuration file support. It
also removes duplicate macro definitions.

It fixes the build failure in cxgb4vf driver introduced because of old macro
definition removal.

It also performs SGE initialization based on T4 configuration file is provided
or not. If it is provided then it uses the parameters provided in it otherwise
it uses hard coded values.
