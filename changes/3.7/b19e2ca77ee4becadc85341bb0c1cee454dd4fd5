TTY: use tty_port_link_device

So now for those drivers that can use neither tty_port_install nor
tty_port_register_driver but still have tty_port available before
tty_register_driver we use newly added tty_port_link_device.

The rest of the drivers that still do not provide tty_struct <->
tty_port link will have to be converted to implement
tty->ops->install.
