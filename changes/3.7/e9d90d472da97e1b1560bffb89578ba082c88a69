KVM: Remove internal timer abstraction

kvm_timer_fn(), the sole inhabitant of timer.c, is only used by lapic.c. Move
it there to make it easier to hack on it.

struct kvm_timer is a thin wrapper around hrtimer, and only adds obfuscation.
Move near its two users (with different names) to prepare for simplification.
