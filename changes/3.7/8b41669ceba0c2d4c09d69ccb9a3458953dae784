mfd: twl4030: Fix chained irq handling on resume from suspend

The irqs are enabled one-by-one in pm core resume_noirq phase.
This leads to situation where the twl4030 primary interrupt
handler (PIH) is enabled before the chained secondary handlers
(SIH). As the PIH cannot clear the pending interrupt, and
SIHs have not been enabled yet, a flood of interrupts hangs
the device.

Fixed the issue by setting the SIH irqs with IRQF_EARLY_RESUME
flags, so they get enabled before the PIH.
