drm/i915: use cpu_relax() in wait_for_atomic

As part of the advice given to us from the hardware designers regarding
the maximum wait time on the forcewake handshake we need to move from us

noticed that wait_for_us was properly converted to use cpu_relax(), but
wait_for was not.

The issue has existed since the introduction of the macro:
