mmc: omap_hsmmc: Handle failure of regulator_get better.

1/ If regulator_get fails, return an error.  This is important if
   it failed with EPROBE_DEFER, as the probe needs to be deferred.

2/ Don't set .set_power until the regulator has been found, or
   the deferred probe will not bother calling omap_hsmmc_reg_get().
