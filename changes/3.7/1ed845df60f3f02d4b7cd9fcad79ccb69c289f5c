xfs: kill struct declarations in xfs_mount.h

I noticed that "struct xfs_mount_args" was still declared in
"fs/xfs/xfs_mount.h".  That struct doesn't even exist any more (and
is obviously not referenced elsewhere in that header file).  While
in there, delete four other unneeded struct declarations in that
file.

Doing so highlights that "fs/xfs/xfs_trace.h" was relying indirectly
on "xfs_mount.h" to be #included in order to declare "struct
xfs_bmbt_irec", so add that declaration to resolve that issue.
