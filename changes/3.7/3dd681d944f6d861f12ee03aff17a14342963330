arm64: 32-bit (compat) applications support

This patch adds support for 32-bit applications. The vectors page is a
binary blob mapped into the application user space at 0xffff0000 (the
AArch64 toolchain does not support compilation of AArch32 code). Full
compatibility with ARMv7 user space is supported. The use of deprecated
ARMv7 functionality (SWP, CP15 barriers) has been disabled by default on
AArch64 kernels and unaligned LDM/STM is not supported.

Please note that only the ARM 32-bit EABI is supported, so no OABI
compatibility.
