i2c: omap: sanitize exit path

move the goto out label one line down, so that
it can be used when stat is read as zero. All
other exits, can be done with a break statement.

While at that, also break out as soon as we
complete draining IRQ, since at that time
we know we transferred everything there was
to be transferred.
