aoe: disallow unsupported AoE minor addresses

A guard is inserted to prevent AoE minor addresses (slot addresses) higher
than 15 to be used, as they are not yet supported by the driver.

There is a change coming that will allow the aoe driver to overcome this
limit by using system device minor numbers dynamically, but until then,
this guard prevents unexpected targets from being used by the driver when
AoE targets with high minor numbers are on the AoE network.
