x86/ce4100: Fix PCI configuration register access for devices without interrupts

Some CE4100 devices such as the:

 - DFX module (01:0b.7)
 - entertainment encryption device (01:10.0)
 - multimedia controller (01:12.0)

do not have a device interrupt at all.

This patch fixes the PCI controller code to declare the missing
PCI configuration register space, as well as a fixup method for
forcing the interrupt pin to be 0 for these devices. This is
required to ensure that pci drivers matching on these devices
will be able to honor the various PCI subsystem calls touching
the configuration space.
