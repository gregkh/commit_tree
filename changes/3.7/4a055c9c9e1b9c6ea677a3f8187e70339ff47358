Delete generic_serial.h

Commit bb2a97e9ccd525dd9c3326988e8c676d15d3e12a ("Staging: delete
generic_serial drivers") left generic_serial.h unused: nothing in the
tree includes it anymore. It is still exported, but since nothing in the
kernel uses the named constants this header provides, that seems
pointless. Delete this header too.
