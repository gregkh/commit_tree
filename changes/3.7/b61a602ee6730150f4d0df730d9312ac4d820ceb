ipvs: initialize returned data in do_ip_vs_get_ctl

As reported by a gcc warning, the do_ip_vs_get_ctl does not initalize
all the members of the ip_vs_timeout_user structure it returns if
at least one of the TCP or UDP protocols is disabled for ipvs.

This makes sure that the data is always initialized, before it is
returned as a response to IPVS_CMD_GET_CONFIG or printed as a
debug message in IPVS_CMD_SET_CONFIG.

Without this patch, building ARM ixp4xx_defconfig results in:
