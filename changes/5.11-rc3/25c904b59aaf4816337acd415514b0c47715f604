net/mlx5: E-Switch, fix changing vf VLANID

Adding vf VLANID for the first time, or after having cleared previously
defined VLANID works fine, however, attempting to change an existing vf
VLANID clears the rules on the firmware, but does not add new rules for
the new vf VLANID.

Fix this by changing the logic in function esw_acl_egress_lgcy_setup()
so that it will always configure egress rules.
