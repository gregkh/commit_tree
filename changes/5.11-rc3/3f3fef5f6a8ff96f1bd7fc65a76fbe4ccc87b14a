rtw88: coex: fixed some wrong register definition and setting

Some register definition and bit definition were incorrect.
e.g. REG_BT_COEX_V2 should be word alignment to meet the coding style.
e.g. set REG_BT_TDMA_TIME[5:0]=0x5,
But the original is to set REG_BT_TDMA_TIME[7:0]=0x5.
This will cause unexpected hardware behavior.
