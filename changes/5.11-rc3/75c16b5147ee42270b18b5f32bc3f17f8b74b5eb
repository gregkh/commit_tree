ALSA: usb-audio: Always set up the parameters after resume

The commit 92adc96f8eec ("ALSA: usb-audio: set the interface format
after resume on Dell WD19") introduced the workaround for the broken
setup after the resume specifically on a Dell dock model.  However,
the full setup should have been performed after the resume on all
devices, as we can't guarantee the same state.  So this patch removes
the conditional check and applies the workaround always.
