kernel/power: allow hibernation with page_poison sanity checking

Page poisoning used to be incompatible with hibernation, as the state of
poisoned pages was lost after resume, thus enabling CONFIG_HIBERNATION
forces CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_NO_SANITY.  For the same reason, the
poisoning with zeroes variant CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_ZERO used to disable
hibernation.  The latter restriction was removed by commit 1ad1410f632d
("PM / Hibernate: allow hibernation with PAGE_POISONING_ZERO") and
similarly for init_on_free by commit 18451f9f9e58 ("PM: hibernate: fix
crashes with init_on_free=1") by making sure free pages are cleared after
resume.

We can use the same mechanism to instead poison free pages with
PAGE_POISON after resume.  This covers both zero and 0xAA patterns.  Thus
we can remove the Kconfig restriction that disables page poison sanity
checking when hibernation is enabled.
