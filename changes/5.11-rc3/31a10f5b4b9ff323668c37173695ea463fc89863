dt-bindings: input: tm2-touchkey: convert to yaml

Convert the device tree bindings for tm2-touchkey to the YAML format.

While we're at it, clarify the descriptions a bit to make it clear that
this driver can be used for many different MCUs that all implement
a similar I2C protocol. Depending on the MCU the voltage requirements
may be different, on some devices the controller uses 2.2V, 2.8V or
even 3.3V for vcc-supply instead of 1.8V.
