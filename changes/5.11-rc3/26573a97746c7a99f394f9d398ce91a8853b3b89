x86/apic: Fix x2apic enablement without interrupt remapping

Currently, Linux as a hypervisor guest will enable x2apic only if there are
no CPUs present at boot time with an APIC ID above 255.

Hotplugging a CPU later with a higher APIC ID would result in a CPU which
cannot be targeted by external interrupts.

Add a filter in x2apic_apic_id_valid() which can be used to prevent such
CPUs from coming online, and allow x2apic to be enabled even if they are
present at boot time.
