entry: Add support for TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL

Add TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL handling in the generic entry code, which if set,
will return true if signal_pending() is used in a wait loop. That causes an
exit of the loop so that notify_signal tracehooks can be run. If the wait
loop is currently inside a system call, the system call is restarted once
task_work has been processed.

In preparation for only having arch_do_signal() handle syscall restarts if
_TIF_SIGPENDING isn't set, rename it to arch_do_signal_or_restart().  Pass
in a boolean that tells the architecture specific signal handler if it
should attempt to get a signal, or just process a potential syscall
restart.

For !CONFIG_GENERIC_ENTRY archs, add the TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL handling to
get_signal(). This is done to minimize the needed architecture changes to
support this feature.
