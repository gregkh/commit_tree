crypto: qat - add support for capability detection

Add logic to detect device capabilities for c62x, c3xxx and dh895xcc.

Read fuses, straps and legfuses CSRs and build the device capabilities
mask. This will be used to understand if a certain service is supported
by a device.

This patch is based on earlier work done by Conor McLoughlin.
