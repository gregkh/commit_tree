efi/x86: Only copy the compressed kernel image in efi_relocate_kernel()

The image_size argument to efi_relocate_kernel() is currently specified
as init_size, but this is unnecessarily large. The compressed kernel is
much smaller, in fact, its image only extends up to the start of _bss,
since at this point, the .bss section is still uninitialized.

Depending on compression level, this can reduce the amount of data
copied by 4-5x.
