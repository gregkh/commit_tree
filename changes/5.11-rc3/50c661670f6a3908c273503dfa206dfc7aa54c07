net: fix pmtu check in nopmtudisc mode

For some reason ip_tunnel insist on setting the DF bit anyway when the
inner header has the DF bit set, EVEN if the tunnel was configured with
'nopmtudisc'.

This means that the script added in the previous commit
cannot be made to work by adding the 'nopmtudisc' flag to the
ip tunnel configuration. Doing so breaks connectivity even for the
without-conntrack/netfilter scenario.

When nopmtudisc is set, the tunnel will skip the mtu check, so no
icmp error is sent to client. Then, because inner header has DF set,
the outer header gets added with DF bit set as well.

IP stack then sends an error to itself because the packet exceeds
the device MTU.
