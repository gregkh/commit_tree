net/smc: improve return codes for SMC-Dv2

To allow better problem diagnosis the return codes for SMC-Dv2 are
improved by this patch. A few more CLC DECLINE codes are defined and
sent to the peer when an SMC connection cannot be established.
There are now multiple SMC variations that are offered by the client and
the server may encounter problems to initialize all of them.
Because only one diagnosis code can be sent to the client the decision
was made to send the first code that was encountered. Because the server
tries the variations in the order of importance (SMC-Dv2, SMC-D, SMC-R)
this makes sure that the diagnosis code of the most important variation
is sent.

v2: initialize rc in smc_listen_v2_check().
