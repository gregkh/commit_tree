memory: renesas-rpc-if: Return correct value to the caller of rpcif_manual_xfer()

In the error path of rpcif_manual_xfer() the value of ret is overwritten
by value returned by reset_control_reset() function and thus returning
incorrect value to the caller.

This patch makes sure the correct value is returned to the caller of
rpcif_manual_xfer() by dropping the overwrite of ret in error path.
Also now we ignore the value returned by reset_control_reset() in the
error path and instead print a error message when it fails.
