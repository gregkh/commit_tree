net: ipa: only enable GSI general IRQs when needed

Most GSI general errors are unrecoverable without a full reset.
Despite that, we want to receive these errors so we can at least
report what happened before whatever undefined behavior ensues.

Explicitly disable all such interrupts in gsi_irq_setup(), then
enable those we want in gsi_irq_enable().  List the interrupt types
we are interested in (everything but breakpoint) explicitly rather
than using GSI_CNTXT_GSI_IRQ_ALL, and remove that symbol's
definition.
