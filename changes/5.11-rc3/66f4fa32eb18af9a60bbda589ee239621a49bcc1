resource: Simplify region_intersects() by reducing conditionals

Now we have for 'other' and 'type' variables

other	type	return
  0	  0	REGION_DISJOINT
  0	  x	REGION_INTERSECTS
  x	  0	REGION_DISJOINT
  x	  x	REGION_MIXED

Obviously it's easier to check 'type' for 0 first instead of
currently checked 'other'.
