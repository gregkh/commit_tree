bpf: Return -ENOTSUPP when attaching to non-kernel BTF

Return -ENOTSUPP if tracing BPF program is attempted to be attached with
specified attach_btf_obj_fd pointing to non-kernel (neither vmlinux nor
module) BTF object. This scenario might be supported in the future and isn't
outright invalid, so -EINVAL isn't the most appropriate error code.
