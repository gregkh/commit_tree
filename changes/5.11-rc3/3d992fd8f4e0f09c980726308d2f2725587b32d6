ARM: dts: exynos: fix USB 3.0 VBUS control and over-current pins on Exynos5410

The VBUS control (PWREN) and over-current pins of USB 3.0 DWC3
controllers are on Exynos5410 regular GPIOs.  This is different than for
example on Exynos5422 where these are special ETC pins with proper reset
values (pulls, functions).

Therefore these pins should be configured to enable proper USB 3.0
peripheral and host modes.  This also fixes over-current warning:

    [    6.024658] usb usb4-port1: over-current condition
    [    6.028271] usb usb3-port1: over-current condition
