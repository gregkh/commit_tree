selftests: set conf.all.rp_filter=0 in bareudp.sh

When working on the rp_filter problem, I didn't realise that disabling
it on the network devices didn't cover all cases: rp_filter could also
be enabled globally in the namespace, in which case it would drop
packets, even if the net device has rp_filter=0.

Fixes: bbbc7aa45eef ("selftests: add test script for bareudp tunnels")
