kselftest: Extend vdso correctness test to clock_gettime64

With the release of Linux 5.1 has been added a new syscall,
clock_gettime64, that provided a 64 bit time value for a specified
clock_ID to make the kernel Y2038 safe on 32 bit architectures.

Extend the vdso correctness test to cover the newly exposed vdso
function.
