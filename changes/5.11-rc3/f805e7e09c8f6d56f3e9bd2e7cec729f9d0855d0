ASoC: SOF: nocodec: modify DAI link definitions

The ignore_machine field in the component driver is used to
ignore the FE DAI links defined in the machine driver,
override BE fixups and set the stream names for the
DAI links defined in the machine driver. This is required
to make SOF compatible with the legacy machine drivers.

In the case of the nocodec machine driver in SOF, there is
no need to rely upon this ignore_machine logic in the core.
Modify the machine driver to set DAI link stream names and the
BE hw_params_fixup callback appropriately.
