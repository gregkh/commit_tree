KVM: arm64: Bootstrap PSCI SMC handler in nVHE EL2

Add a handler of PSCI SMCs in nVHE hyp code. The handler is initialized
with the version used by the host's PSCI driver and the function IDs it
was configured with. If the SMC function ID matches one of the
configured PSCI calls (for v0.1) or falls into the PSCI function ID
range (for v0.2+), the SMC is handled by the PSCI handler. For now, all
SMCs return PSCI_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED.
