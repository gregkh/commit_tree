kasan: add and integrate kasan boot parameters

Hardware tag-based KASAN mode is intended to eventually be used in
production as a security mitigation. Therefore there's a need for finer
control over KASAN features and for an existence of a kill switch.

This change adds a few boot parameters for hardware tag-based KASAN that
allow to disable or otherwise control particular KASAN features.

The features that can be controlled are:

1. Whether KASAN is enabled at all.
2. Whether KASAN collects and saves alloc/free stacks.
3. Whether KASAN panics on a detected bug or not.

With this change a new boot parameter kasan.mode allows to choose one of
three main modes:

- kasan.mode=off - KASAN is disabled, no tag checks are performed
- kasan.mode=prod - only essential production features are enabled
- kasan.mode=full - all KASAN features are enabled

The chosen mode provides default control values for the features mentioned
above. However it's also possible to override the default values by
providing:

- kasan.stacktrace=off/on - enable alloc/free stack collection
                            (default: on for mode=full, otherwise off)
- kasan.fault=report/panic - only report tag fault or also panic
                             (default: report)

If kasan.mode parameter is not provided, it defaults to full when
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL is enabled, and to prod otherwise.

It is essential that switching between these modes doesn't require
rebuilding the kernel with different configs, as this is required by
the Android GKI (Generic Kernel Image) initiative [1].
