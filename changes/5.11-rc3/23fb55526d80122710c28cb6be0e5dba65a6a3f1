selftests: mlxsw: Test RIF's reference count when joining a LAG

Test that the reference count of a router interface (RIF) configured for
a LAG is incremented / decremented when ports join / leave the LAG. Use
the offload indication on routes configured on the RIF to understand if
it was created / destroyed.

The test fails without the previous patch.
