drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Make polling a busy loop

There's no reason we need to wait here to poll a register over i2c. The
i2c bus is inherently slow and delays are practically part of the
protocol because we have to wait for the device to respond to any
request for a register. Let's rely on the sleeping of the i2c controller
instead of adding any sort of delay here in the bridge driver.
