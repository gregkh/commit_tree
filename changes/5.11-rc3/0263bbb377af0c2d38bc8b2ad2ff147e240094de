powerpc/perf: Fix the PMU group constraints for threshold events in power10

The PMU group constraints mask for threshold events covers
all thresholding bits which includes threshold control value
(start/stop), select value as well as thresh_cmp value (MMCRA[9:18].
In power9, thresh_cmp bits were part of the event code. But in case
of power10, thresh_cmp bits are not part of event code due to
inclusion of MMCR3 bits. Hence thresh_cmp is not valid for
group constraints for power10.

Fix the PMU group constraints checking for threshold events in
power10 by using constraint mask and value for only threshold control
and select bits.
