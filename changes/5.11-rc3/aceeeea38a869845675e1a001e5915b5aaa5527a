drm/amd/display: fix cursor calculation for 1xnY rotated display groups

[Why]
Cursor is missing on displays 2 and up when doing rotated
 display groups in 1xnY setup.  Calculation puts cursor
 out of bounds so it is not enabled.

[How]
In dcn10_set_cursor_position(), add in viewport.y into cursor
 calculations for 1xnY rotated display groups.
For pipe split, check viewport.y for both pipes and use lower one
 to normalize cursor position before calculations.
Add odm 2:1 support ( using same calculations as pipe split ).
