gpiolib: cdev: allow edge event timestamps to be configured as REALTIME

Using CLOCK_REALTIME as the source for event timestamps is crucial for
some specific applications, particularly those requiring timetamps
relative to a PTP clock, so provide an option to switch the event
timestamp source from the default CLOCK_MONOTONIC to CLOCK_REALTIME.

Note that CLOCK_REALTIME was the default source clock for GPIO until
Linux 5.7 when it was changed to CLOCK_MONOTONIC due to issues with the
shifting of the realtime clock.
Providing this option maintains the CLOCK_MONOTONIC as the default,
while also providing a path forward for those dependent on the pre-5.7
behaviour.
