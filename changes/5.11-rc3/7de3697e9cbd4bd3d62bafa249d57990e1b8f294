Add auxiliary bus support

Add support for the Auxiliary Bus, auxiliary_device and auxiliary_driver.
It enables drivers to create an auxiliary_device and bind an
auxiliary_driver to it.

The bus supports probe/remove shutdown and suspend/resume callbacks.
Each auxiliary_device has a unique string based id; driver binds to
an auxiliary_device based on this id through the bus.
