btrfs: cleanup extent buffer readahead

We're going to pass around more information when we allocate extent
buffers, in order to make that cleaner how we do readahead.  Most of the
callers have the parent node that we're getting our blockptr from, with
the sole exception of relocation which simply has the bytenr it wants to
read.

Add a helper that takes the current arguments that we need (bytenr and
gen), and add another helper for simply reading the slot out of a node.
In followup patches the helper that takes all the extra arguments will
be expanded, and the simpler helper won't need to have it's arguments
adjusted.
