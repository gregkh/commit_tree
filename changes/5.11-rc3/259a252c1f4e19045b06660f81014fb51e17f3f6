console: Delete dummy con_font_set() and con_font_default() callback implementations

.con_font_set and .con_font_default callbacks should not pass `struct
console_font *` as a parameter, since `struct console_font` is a UAPI
structure.

We are trying to let them use our new kernel font descriptor, `struct
font_desc` instead. To make that work slightly easier, first delete all of
their no-op implementations used by dummy consoles.

This will make KD_FONT_OP_SET and KD_FONT_OP_SET_DEFAULT ioctl() requests
on dummy consoles start to fail and return `-ENOSYS`, which is intended,
since no user should ever expect such operations to succeed on dummy
consoles.
