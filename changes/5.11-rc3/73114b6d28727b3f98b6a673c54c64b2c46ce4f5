f2fs: remove f2fs_dir_open()

Since encrypted directories can be opened and searched without their key
being available, and each readdir and ->lookup() tries to set up the
key, trying to set up the key in ->open() too isn't really useful.

Just remove it so that directories don't need an ->open() method
anymore, and so that we eliminate a use of fscrypt_get_encryption_info()
(which I'd like to stop exporting to filesystems).
