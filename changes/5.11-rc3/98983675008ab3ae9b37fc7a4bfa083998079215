KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Show detailed configuration in debug output

This is useful to track allocation of the HW resources on per guest
basis. Making sure IPIs are local to the chip of the vCPUs reduces
rerouting between interrupt controllers and gives better performance
in case of pinning. Checking the distribution of VP structures on the
chips also helps in reducing PowerBUS traffic.
