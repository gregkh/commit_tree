mptcp: be careful on MPTCP-level ack.

We can enter the main mptcp_recvmsg() loop even when
no subflows are connected. As note by Eric, that would
result in a divide by zero oops on ack generation.

Address the issue by checking the subflow status before
sending the ack.

Additionally protect mptcp_recvmsg() against invocation
with weird socket states.

v1 -> v2:
 - removed unneeded inline keyword - Jakub
