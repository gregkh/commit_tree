block/rnbd: fix a null pointer dereference on dev->blk_symlink_name

Currently in the case where dev->blk_symlink_name fails to be allocates
the error return path attempts to set an end-of-string character to
the unallocated dev->blk_symlink_name causing a null pointer dereference
error. Fix this by returning with an explicity ENOMEM error (which also
is missing in the original code as was not initialized).
