arm64: zynqmp: Move gic node to axi bus

The reason for this change is that after change from amba to axi U-Boot
started to show error like:
Unable to update property /axi/ethernet@ff0e0000:mac-address, err=FDT_ERR_NOTFOUND
Unable to update property /axi/ethernet@ff0e0000:local-mac-address, err=FDT_ERR_NOTFOUND

The reason is implementation in fdt_nodename_eq_() which is taken from dtc
to the kernel and to the U-Boot. Especially DTC commit d2a9da045897 ("libfdt:
Make unit address optional for finding nodes") which is in DTC from 2007.

The part of commit description is
"   This is contrary to traditional OF-like finddevice() behaviour, which
    allows the unit address to be omitted (which is useful when the device
    name is unambiguous without the address)."

The kernel commit dfff9066e60e ("arm64: dts: zynqmp: Rename buses to be
align with simple-bus yaml") changed amba-apu/amba to axi@0/axi but
fdt_nodename_eq_() detects /axi/ as match for /axi@0/ because of commit
above.

That's why it easier to fix one DT inside the kernel by moving GIC node
from own bus to generic axi bus as is done by others SoCs. This will avoid
incorrect match because the unit address is omitted.
