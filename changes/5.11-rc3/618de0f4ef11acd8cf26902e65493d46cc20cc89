ALSA: pcm: Clear the full allocated memory at hw_params

The PCM hw_params core function tries to clear up the PCM buffer
before actually using for avoiding the information leak from the
previous usages or the usage before a new allocation.  It performs the
memset() with runtime->dma_bytes, but this might still leave some
remaining bytes untouched; namely, the PCM buffer size is aligned in
page size for mmap, hence runtime->dma_bytes doesn't necessarily cover
all PCM buffer pages, and the remaining bytes are exposed via mmap.

This patch changes the memory clearance to cover the all buffer pages
if the stream is supposed to be mmap-ready (that guarantees that the
buffer size is aligned in page size).
