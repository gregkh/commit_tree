RDMA/hns: Support owner mode doorbell

The doorbell needs to store PI information into QPC, so the RoCEE should
wait for the results of storing, that is, it needs two bus operations to
complete a doorbell. When ROCEE is in SDI mode, multiple doorbells may be
interlocked because the RoCEE can only handle bus operations serially. So a
flag to mark if HIP09 is working in SDI mode is added. When the SDI flag is
set, the ROCEE will ignore the PI information of the doorbell, continue to
fetch wqe and verify its validity by it's owner_bit.
