ALSA: usb-audio: Use atomic_t for endpoint use_count

The endpoint objects may be started/stopped concurrently by different
substreams in the case of implicit feedback mode, while the current
code handles the reference counter without any protection.

This patch changes the refcount to atomic_t for avoiding the
inconsistency.  We need no reference_t here as the refcount goes only
up to 2.

Also the name "use_count" is renamed to "running" since this is about
actually the running status, not the open refcount.
