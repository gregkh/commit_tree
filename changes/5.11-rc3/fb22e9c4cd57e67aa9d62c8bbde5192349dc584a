btrfs: use detach_page_private() in alloc_extent_buffer()

In alloc_extent_buffer(), after we got a page from btree inode, we check
if that page has private pointer attached.

If attached, we check if the existing extent buffer has proper refs.
If not (the eb is being freed), we will detach that private eb pointer.

The point here is, we are detaching that eb pointer by calling:
- ClearPagePrivate()
- put_page()

The put_page() here is especially confusing, as it's decreasing the ref
from attach_page_private().  Without knowing that, it looks like the
put_page() is for the find_or_create_page() call, confusing the reader.

Since we're always modifying page private with attach_page_private() and
detach_page_private(), the only open-coded detach_page_private() here is
really confusing.

Fix it by calling detach_page_private().
