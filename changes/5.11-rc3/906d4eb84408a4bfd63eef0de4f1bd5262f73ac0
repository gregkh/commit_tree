iwlwifi: support firmware reset handshake

There are some races in the hardware that can possibly lead to
a bus lockup later during a restart when we manage to kill the
firmware at a bad time (while it's accessing the bus).

To work around this, add support for a new handshake between
firmware and driver to ensure that the firmware is in a well-
known state before we kill it.
