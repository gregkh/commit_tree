dt-bindings: interconnect: sdm845: Add IDs for the QUP ports

The QUP ports exist in the topology, but are not exposed as an
endpoints in DT. Fix this by creating IDs and attach them to their
NoCs, so that the various QUP drivers (i2c/spi/uart etc.) are able
to request their interconnect paths and scale their bandwidth.
