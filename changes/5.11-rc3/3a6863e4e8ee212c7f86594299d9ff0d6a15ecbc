net: hns3: add support for pf querying new interrupt resources

For HNAE3_DEVICE_VERSION_V3, a maximum of 1281 interrupt
resources are supported. To utilize these new resources,
extend the corresponding field or variable to 16bit type,
and remove the restriction of NIC client that only use a
maximum of 65 interrupt vectors. In addition, the I/O address
of the extended interrupt resources are different, so an extra
handler is needed.

Currently, the total number of interrupts is the sum of RoCE's
number and RoCE's offset (RoCE is in front of NIC), since
the number of both NIC and RoCE are same. For readability,
rewrite the corresponding field of the command, rename the
RoCE's offset field as the number of NIC interrupts, then
the total number of interrupts is sum of the number of RoCE
and NIC, and replace vport->back with hdev in
hclge_init_roce_base_info() for simplifying the code.
