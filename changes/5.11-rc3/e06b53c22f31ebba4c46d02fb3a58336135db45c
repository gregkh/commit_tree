file: In f_dupfd read RLIMIT_NOFILE once.

Simplify the code, and remove the chance of races by reading
RLIMIT_NOFILE only once in f_dupfd.

Pass the read value of RLIMIT_NOFILE into alloc_fd which is the other
location the rlimit was read in f_dupfd.  As f_dupfd is the only
caller of alloc_fd this changing alloc_fd is trivially safe.

Further this causes alloc_fd to take all of the same arguments as
__alloc_fd except for the files_struct argument.
