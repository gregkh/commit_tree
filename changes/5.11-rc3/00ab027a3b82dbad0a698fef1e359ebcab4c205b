RISC-V: Add kernel image sections to the resource tree

This patch (previously part of my kexec/kdump series) populates
/proc/iomem with the various sections of the kernel image. We need
this for kexec-tools to be able to prepare the crashkernel image
for kdump to work. Since resource tree initialization is not
related to memory initialization I added the code to kernel/setup.c
and removed the original code (derived from the arm64 tree) from
mm/init.c.
