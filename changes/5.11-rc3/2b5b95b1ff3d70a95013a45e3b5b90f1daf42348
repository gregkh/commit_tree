mm: introduce vma_set_file function v4

Add the new vma_set_file() function to allow changing
vma->vm_file with the necessary refcount dance.

v2: add more users of this.
v3: add missing EXPORT_SYMBOL, rebase on mmap cleanup,
    add comments why we drop the reference on two occasions.
v4: make it clear that changing an anonymous vma is illegal.
