ALSA: hda/via: Fix runtime PM for Clevo W35xSS

Clevo W35xSS_370SS with VIA codec has had the runtime PM problem that
looses the power state of some nodes after the runtime resume.  This
was worked around by disabling the default runtime PM via a denylist
entry.  Since 5.10.x made the runtime PM applied (casually) even
though it's disabled in the denylist, this problem was revisited.  The
result was that disabling power_save_node feature suffices for the
runtime PM problem.

This patch implements the disablement of power_save_node feature in
VIA codec for the device.  It also drops the former denylist entry,
too, as the runtime PM should work in the codec side properly now.
