gpiolib: irq hooks: fix recursion in gpiochip_irq_unmask

irqchip shared with multiple gpiochips, leads to recursive call of
gpiochip_irq_mask/gpiochip_irq_unmask which was assigned to
rqchip->irq_mask/irqchip->irq_unmask, these happens becouse of
only irqchip->irq_enable == gpiochip_irq_enable is checked.

Let's add an additional check to make sure shared irqchip is detected
even if irqchip->irq_enable wasn't defined.
