x86/traps: Attempt to fixup exceptions in vDSO before signaling

vDSO functions can now leverage an exception fixup mechanism similar to
kernel exception fixup.  For vDSO exception fixup, the initial user is
Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which will wrap the low-level
transitions to/from the enclave, i.e. EENTER and ERESUME instructions,
in a vDSO function and leverage fixup to intercept exceptions that would
otherwise generate a signal.  This allows the vDSO wrapper to return the
fault information directly to its caller, obviating the need for SGX
applications and libraries to juggle signal handlers.

Attempt to fixup vDSO exceptions immediately prior to populating and
sending signal information.  Except for the delivery mechanism, an
exception in a vDSO function should be treated like any other exception
in userspace, e.g. any fault that is successfully handled by the kernel
should not be directly visible to userspace.

Although it's debatable whether or not all exceptions are of interest to
enclaves, defer to the vDSO fixup to decide whether to do fixup or
generate a signal.  Future users of vDSO fixup, if there ever are any,
will undoubtedly have different requirements than SGX enclaves, e.g. the
fixup vs. signal logic can be made function specific if/when necessary.
