um: allocate a guard page to helper threads

We've been running into stack overflows in helper threads
corrupting memory (e.g. because somebody put printf() or
os_info() there), so to avoid those causing hard-to-debug
issues later on, allocate a guard page for helper thread
stacks and mark it read-only.

Unfortunately, the crash dump at that point is useless as
the stack tracer will try to backtrace the *kernel* thread,
not the helper thread, but at least we don't survive to a
random issue caused by corruption.
