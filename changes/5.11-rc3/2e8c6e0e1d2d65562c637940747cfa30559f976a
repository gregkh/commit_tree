null_blk: Improve implicit zone close

When open zone resource management is enabled, that is, when a null_blk
zoned device is created with zone_max_open different than 0, implicitly
or explicitly opening a zone may require implicitly closing a zone
that is already implicitly open. This operation is done using the
function null_close_first_imp_zone(), which search for an implicitly
open zone to close starting from the first sequential zone. This
implementation is simple but may result in the same being constantly
implicitly closed and then implicitly reopened on write, namely, the
lowest numbered zone that is being written.

Avoid this by starting the search for an implicitly open zone starting
from the zone following the last zone that was implicitly closed. The
function null_close_first_imp_zone() is renamed
null_close_imp_open_zone().
