vxlan: avoid double unlikely() notation when using IS_ERR()

The definition of IS_ERR() already applies the unlikely() notation
when checking the error status of the passed pointer. For this
reason there is no need to have the same notation outside of
IS_ERR() itself.

Clean up code by removing redundant notation.
