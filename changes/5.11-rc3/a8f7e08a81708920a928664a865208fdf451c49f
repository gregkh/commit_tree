x86/sev-es: Fix SEV-ES OUT/IN immediate opcode vc handling

The IN and OUT instructions with port address as an immediate operand
only use an 8-bit immediate (imm8). The current VC handler uses the
entire 32-bit immediate value but these instructions only set the first
bytes.

Cast the operand to an u8 for that.
