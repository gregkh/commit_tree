mm: cleanup: remove unused tsk arg from __access_remote_vm

Despite a comment that said that page fault accounting would be charged to
whatever task_struct* was passed into __access_remote_vm(), the tsk
argument was actually unused.

Making page fault accounting actually use this task struct is quite a
project, so there is no point in keeping the tsk argument.

Delete both the comment, and the argument.
