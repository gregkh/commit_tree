KVM: arm64: Allocate hyp vectors statically

The EL2 vectors installed when a guest is running point at one of the
following configurations for a given CPU:

  - Straight at __kvm_hyp_vector
  - A trampoline containing an SMC sequence to mitigate Spectre-v2 and
    then a direct branch to __kvm_hyp_vector
  - A dynamically-allocated trampoline which has an indirect branch to
    __kvm_hyp_vector
  - A dynamically-allocated trampoline containing an SMC sequence to
    mitigate Spectre-v2 and then an indirect branch to __kvm_hyp_vector

The indirect branches mean that VA randomization at EL2 isn't trivially
bypassable using Spectre-v3a (where the vector base is readable by the
guest).

Rather than populate these vectors dynamically, configure everything
statically and use an enumerated type to identify the vector "slot"
corresponding to one of the configurations above. This both simplifies
the code, but also makes it much easier to implement at EL2 later on.
