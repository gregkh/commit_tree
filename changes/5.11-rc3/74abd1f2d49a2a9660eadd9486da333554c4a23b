bus: fsl-mc: make sure MC firmware is up and running

Some bootloaders might pause the MC firmware before starting the
kernel to ensure that MC will not cause faults as soon as SMMU
probes due to no configuration being in place for the firmware.
Make sure that MC is resumed at probe time as its SMMU setup should
be done by now.
Also included, a comment fix on how PL and BMT bits are packed in
the StreamID.
