m68k: deprecate DISCONTIGMEM

DISCONTIGMEM was intended to provide more efficient support for systems
with holes in their physical address space that FLATMEM did.

Yet, it's overhead in terms of the memory consumption seems to
overweight the savings on the unused memory map.

For a ARAnyM system with 16 MBytes of FastRAM configured, the memory
usage reported after page allocator initialization is

  Memory: 23828K/30720K available (3206K kernel code, 535K rwdata, 936K rodata, 768K init, 193K bss, 6892K reserved, 0K cma-reserved)

and with DISCONTIGMEM disabled and with relatively large hole in the memory
map it is:

  Memory: 23864K/30720K available (3197K kernel code, 516K rwdata, 936K rodata, 764K init, 179K bss, 6856K reserved, 0K cma-reserved)

Moreover, since m68k already has custom pfn_valid() it is possible to
define HAVE_ARCH_PFN_VALID to enable freeing of unused memory map.  The
minimal size of a hole that can be freed should not be less than
MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES so to achieve more substantial memory savings let
m68k also define custom FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER.

With FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER set to 9 memory usage becomes:

  Memory: 23880K/30720K available (3197K kernel code, 516K rwdata, 936K rodata, 764K init, 179K bss, 6840K reserved, 0K cma-reserved)
