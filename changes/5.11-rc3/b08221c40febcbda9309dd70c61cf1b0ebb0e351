ACPI: PNP: compare the string length in the matching_id()

Recently we met a touchscreen problem on some Thinkpad machines, the
touchscreen driver (i2c-hid) is not loaded and the touchscreen can't
work.

An i2c ACPI device with the name WACF2200 is defined in the BIOS, with
the current rule in matching_id(), this device will be regarded as
a PNP device since there is WACFXXX in the acpi_pnp_device_ids[] and
this PNP device is attached to the acpi device as the 1st
physical_node, this will make the i2c bus match fail when i2c bus
calls acpi_companion_match() to match the acpi_id_table in the i2c-hid
driver.

WACF2200 is an i2c device instead of a PNP device, after adding the
string length comparing, the matching_id() will return false when
matching WACF2200 and WACFXXX, and it is reasonable to compare the
string length when matching two IDs.
