net/smc: Add diagnostic information to link structure

During link creation add net-device ifindex and ib-device
name to link structure. This is needed for diagnostic purposes.

When diagnostic information is gathered, we need to traverse
device, linkgroup and link structures, to be able to do that
we need to hold a spinlock for the linkgroup list, without this
diagnostic information in link structure, another device list
mutex holding would be necessary to dereference the device
pointer in the link structure which would be impossible when
holding a spinlock already.
