iio: hrtimer-trigger: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard interrupt context

On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels unmarked hrtimers are moved into soft
interrupt expiry mode by default.

The IIO hrtimer-trigger needs to run in hard interrupt context since it
will end up calling generic_handle_irq() which has the requirement to run
in hard interrupt context.

Explicitly specify that the timer needs to run in hard interrupt context by
using the HRTIMER_MODE_REL_HARD flag.
