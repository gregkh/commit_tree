tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Read TRL from mailbox

When SST-PP feature is not present, the TRL (Turbo Ratio Limits)
is read from MSRs. This is done as the mailbox command will fail
on Skylake-X based platform. But for IceLake servers, mailbox
commands can still be used. So add a check to allow for non Skylake
based platforms to read from mail box commands.
