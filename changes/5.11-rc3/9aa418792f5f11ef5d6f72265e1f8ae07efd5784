KVM: x86/mmu: Optimize not-present/MMIO SPTE check in get_mmio_spte()

Check only the terminal leaf for a "!PRESENT || MMIO" SPTE when looking
for reserved bits on valid, non-MMIO SPTEs.  The get_walk() helpers
terminate their walks if a not-present or MMIO SPTE is encountered, i.e.
the non-terminal SPTEs have already been verified to be regular SPTEs.
This eliminates an extra check-and-branch in a relatively hot loop.
