platform/chrome: cros_ec: Import Type C host commands

Import the EC_CMD_TYPEC_STATUS and EC_CMD_TYPEC_DISCOVERY Chrome OS EC
host commands from the EC code base [1].

These commands can be used by the application processor to query Power
Delivery (PD) discovery information concerning connected Type C
peripherals.

Also add the EC_FEATURE_TYPEC_CMD feature flag, which is used to
determine whether these commands are supported by the EC.
