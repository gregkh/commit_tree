can: replace can_dlc as variable/element for payload length

The naming of can_dlc as element of struct can_frame and also as variable
name is misleading as it claims to be a 'data length CODE' but in reality
it always was a plain data length.

With the indroduction of a new 'len' element in struct can_frame we can now
remove can_dlc as name and make clear which of the former uses was a plain
length (-> 'len') or a data length code (-> 'dlc') value.
