gpio: Retire the explicit gpio irqchip code

Now that all gpiolib irqchip users have been over to use
the irqchip template, we can finally retire the old code
path and leave just one way in to the irqchip: set up the
template when registering the gpio_chip. For a while
we had two code paths for this which was a bit confusing.

This brings this work to a conclusion, there is now one
way of doing this.
