scsi: pm80xx: Make mpi_build_cmd locking consistent

Driver submits all internal requests (like abort_task, event acknowledgment
etc.) through inbound queue 0. While submitting those, driver does not
acquire any lock and this may lead to a race when there is an I/O request
coming in on CPU0 and submitted through inbound queue 0.  To avoid this,
lock acquisition has been moved to pm8001_mpi_build_cmd().  All command
submission will go through this path.
