ARM: 9032/1: arm/mm: Convert PUD level pgtable helper macros into functions

Macros used as functions can be problematic from the compiler perspective.
There was a build failure report caused primarily because of non reference
of an argument variable. Hence convert PUD level pgtable helper macros into
functions in order to avoid such problems in the future. In the process, it

fixes the argument variables sequence in set_pud() which probably remained
hidden for being a macro.
