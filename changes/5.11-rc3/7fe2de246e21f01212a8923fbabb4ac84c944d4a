powerpc/vdso: Stripped VDSO is not needed, don't build it

Since commit 24b659a13866 ("powerpc: Use unstripped VDSO image for
more accurate profiling data"), only the unstripped VDSO image
has been used.

Partially revert commit 8150caad0226 ("[POWERPC] powerpc vDSO: install
unstripped copies on disk") to avoid building the stripped version.

And the unstripped version in $(MODLIB)/vdso/ is not required
anymore as it is the one embedded in the kernel image.
