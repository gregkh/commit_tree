docs: networking: packet_mmap: fix old config reference

Before commit 889b8f964f2f ("packet: Kill CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP.") there
used to be a CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP config symbol that depended on
CONFIG_PACKET. The text still implies that PACKET_MMAP can be disabled.
Remove that from the text, as well as reference to old kernel versions.

Also, drop reference to broken link to information for pre 2.6.5
kernels.

Make a slight working improvement (s/In/On/) while at it.
