net: neighbor: fix a crash caused by mod zero

pneigh_enqueue() tries to obtain a random delay by mod
NEIGH_VAR(p, PROXY_DELAY). However, NEIGH_VAR(p, PROXY_DELAY)
migth be zero at that point because someone could write zero
to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/[device]/proxy_delay after the
callers check it.

This patch uses prandom_u32_max() to get a random delay instead
which avoids potential division by zero.
