net/sched: act_ct: enable stats for HW offloaded entries

By setting NF_FLOWTABLE_COUNTER. Otherwise, the updates added by
commit ef803b3cf96a ("netfilter: flowtable: add counter support in HW
offload") are not effective when using act_ct.

While at it, now that we have the flag set, protect the call to
nf_ct_acct_update() by commit beb97d3a3192 ("net/sched: act_ct: update
nf_conn_acct for act_ct SW offload in flowtable") with the check on
NF_FLOWTABLE_COUNTER, as also done on other places.

Note that this shouldn't impact performance as these stats are only
enabled when net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct is enabled.
