ARM: head.S: use PC-relative insn sequence for secondary_data

Replace the open coded PC relative offset calculations with adr_l
and ldr_l invocations. This removes some open coded arithmetic
involving virtual addresses, avoids literal pools on v7+, and slightly
reduces the footprint of the code.

Note that it also removes a stale comment about the contents of r6.
