drm/amd/display: Add pipe_state tracepoint

This commit introduces a trace mechanism for struct pipe_ctx by adding a
middle layer struct in the amdgpu_dm_trace.h for capturing the most
important data from struct pipe_ctx and showing its data via tracepoint.
This tracepoint was added to dc.c and dcn10_hw_sequencer, however, it
can be added to other DCN architecture.
