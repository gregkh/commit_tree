scsi: zfcp: Handle event-lost notification for Version Change events

As recovery for a lost Version Change event, trigger an Exchange Config
Data cmd to retrieve the current FW version.

Doing so requires process context (as eg. zfcp_qdio_sbal_get() might need
to sleep), so defer from tasklet context into a work item.
