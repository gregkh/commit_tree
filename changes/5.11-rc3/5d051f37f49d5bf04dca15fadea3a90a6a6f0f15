dmaengine: ti: drop of_match_ptr and mark of_device_id table as maybe unused

The driver can match only via the DT table so the main table should be
always used and the of_match_ptr does not have any sense (this also
allows ACPI matching via PRP0001, even though it is not relevant here).

The secondary match of_device_id tables (passed to of_match_node) should
be marked as maybe unused to fix compile testing (!CONFIG_OF on x86_64)
