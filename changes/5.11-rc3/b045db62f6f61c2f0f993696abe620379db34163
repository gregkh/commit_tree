RDMA/mlx5: Use ib_umem_find_best_pgoff() for SRQ

SRQ uses a quantized and scaled page_offset, which is another variation of
ib_umem_find_best_pgsz(). Add mlx5_umem_find_best_quantized_pgoff() to
perform this calculation for each mailbox. A macro shows how the
calculation is directly connected to the mailbox format.

This new routine replaces the limited mlx5_ib_cont_pages() and
mlx5_ib_get_buf_offset() pairing which would reject valid configurations
rather than adjust the page_size to make it work.

In turn this is much more aggressive about choosing large page sizes for
these objects and when THP is enabled it will now often find a single page
solution.
