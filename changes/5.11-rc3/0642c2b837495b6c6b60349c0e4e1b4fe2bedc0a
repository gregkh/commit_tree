drm/i915/dg1: Don't program PHY_MISC for PHY-C and PHY-D

The only bit we use in PHY_MISC is DE_IO_COMP_PWR_DOWN, and the bspec
details for that bit tell us that it need only be set for PHY-A and
PHY-B.  It also turns out that there isn't even an instance of the
PHY_MISC register for PHY-D on this platform.  Let's extend the EHL/RKL
logic that conditionally skips PHY_MISC usage to DG1 as well.
