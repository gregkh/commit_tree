ASoC: pcm512x: Rearrange operations in `hw_params()`

This commit is a preparation for the next patch in the series.
It's goal is to make format check easy-to-move-out. Theoretically, more
butifications are possile in `hw_params()` func, but my intention in this
commit is to keep behaviour unchanged.
