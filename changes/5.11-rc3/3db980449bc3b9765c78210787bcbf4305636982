selftests/bpf: Update ima_setup.sh for busybox

losetup on busybox does not output the name of loop device on using
-f with --show. It also doesn't support -j to find the loop devices
for a given backing file. losetup is updated to use "-a" which is
available on busybox.

blkid does not support options (-s and -o) to only display the uuid, so
parse the output instead.

Not all environments have mkfs.ext4, the test requires a loop device
with a backing image file which could formatted with any filesystem.
Update to using mkfs.ext2 which is available on busybox.
