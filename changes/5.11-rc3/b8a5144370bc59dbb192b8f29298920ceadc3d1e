scsi: message: fusion: Remove in_interrupt() usage in mpt_config()

in_interrupt() is referenced all over the place in these drivers. Most of
these references are comments which are outdated and wrong.

Aside of that in_interrupt() is deprecated as it does not provide what the
name suggests. It covers more than hard/soft interrupt servicing context
and is semantically ill defined.

>From reading the mpt_config() code and the history this is clearly a debug
mechanism and should probably be replaced by might_sleep() or completely
removed because such checks are already in the subsequent functions.

Remove the in_interrupt() references and replace the usage in mpt_config()
with might_sleep().
