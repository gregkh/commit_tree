gfs2: Remove sb_start_write from gfs2_statfs_sync

Before this patch, function gfs2_statfs_sync called sb_start_write and
sb_end_write. This is completely unnecessary because, aside from grabbing
glocks, gfs2_statfs_sync does all its updates to statfs with a transaction:
gfs2_trans_begin and _end. And transactions always do sb_start_intwrite in
gfs2_trans_begin and sb_end_intwrite in gfs2_trans_end.

This patch simply removes the call to sb_start_write.
