net: phy: don't duplicate driver name in phy_attached_print

Currently we print the driver name twice in phy_attached_print():
- phy_dev_info() prints it as part of the device info
- and we print it as part of the info string

This is a little bit ugly, it makes the info harder to read,
especially if the driver name is a little bit longer.
Therefore omit the driver name (if set) in the info string.

Example from r8169 that uses phylib:

old: Generic FE-GE Realtek PHY r8169-300:00: attached PHY driver \
   [Generic FE-GE Realtek PHY] (mii_bus:phy_addr=r8169-300:00, irq=IGNORE)
new: Generic FE-GE Realtek PHY r8169-300:00: attached PHY driver \
   (mii_bus:phy_addr=r8169-300:00, irq=IGNORE)
