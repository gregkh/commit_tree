spi: fix resource leak for drivers without .remove callback

Consider an spi driver with a .probe but without a .remove callback (e.g.
rtc-ds1347). The function spi_drv_probe() is called to bind a device and
so dev_pm_domain_attach() is called. As there is no remove callback
spi_drv_remove() isn't called at unbind time however and so calling
dev_pm_domain_detach() is missed and the pm domain keeps active.

To fix this always use both spi_drv_probe() and spi_drv_remove() and
make them handle the respective callback not being set. This has the
side effect that for a (hypothetical) driver that has neither .probe nor
remove the clk and pm domain setup is done.
