s390/kasan: remove 3-level paging support

Compiling the kernel with Kasan disables automatic 3-level vs 4-level
kernel space paging selection, because the shadow memory offset has
to be known at compile time and there is no such offset which would be
acceptable for both 3 and 4-level paging. Instead S390_4_LEVEL_PAGING
option was introduced which allowed to pick how many paging levels to
use under Kasan.

With the introduction of protected virtualization, kernel memory layout
may be affected due to ultravisor secure storage limit. This adds
additional complexity into how memory layout would look like in
combination with Kasan predefined shadow memory offsets. To simplify
this make Kasan 4-level paging default and remove Kasan 3-level paging
support.
