block/rnbd: Set write-back cache and fua same to the target device

The rnbd-client always sets the write-back cache and fua attributes
of the rnbd device queue regardless of the target device on the server.
That generates IO hang issue when the target device does not
support both of write-back cacne and fua.

This patch adds more fields for the cache policy and fua into the
device opening message. The rnbd-server sends the information
if the target device supports the write-back cache and fua
and rnbd-client recevives it and set the device queue accordingly.
