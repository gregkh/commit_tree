fs/ext2: Use ext2_put_page

There are 3 places in namei.c where the equivalent of ext2_put_page() is
open coded on a page which was returned from the ext2_get_page() call
[through the use of ext2_find_entry() and ext2_dotdot()].

Move ext2_put_page() to ext2.h and use it in namei.c

Also add a comment regarding the proper way to release the page returned
from ext2_find_entry() and ext2_dotdot().
