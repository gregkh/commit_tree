ftrace: Move the recursion testing into global headers

Currently, if a callback is registered to a ftrace function and its
ftrace_ops does not have the RECURSION flag set, it is encapsulated in a
helper function that does the recursion for it.

Really, all the callbacks should have their own recursion protection for
performance reasons. But they should not all implement their own. Move the
recursion helpers to global headers, so that all callbacks can use them.
