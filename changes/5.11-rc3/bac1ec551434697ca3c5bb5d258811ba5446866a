usb: xhci: Set quirk for XHCI_SG_TRB_CACHE_SIZE_QUIRK

This commit uses the private data passed by parent device
to set the quirk for Synopsys xHC. This patch fixes the
SNPS xHC hang issue when the data is scattered across
small buffers which does not make atleast MPS size for
given TRB cache size of SNPS xHC.
