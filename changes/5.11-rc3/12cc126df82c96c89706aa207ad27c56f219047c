bpf: Fix bpf_put_raw_tracepoint()'s use of __module_address()

__module_address() needs to be called with preemption disabled or with
module_mutex taken. preempt_disable() is enough for read-only uses, which is
what this fix does. Also, module_put() does internal check for NULL, so drop
it as well.
