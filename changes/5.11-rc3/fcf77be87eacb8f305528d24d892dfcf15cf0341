clk: fsl-flexspi: new driver

Add support for the FlexSPI clock on Freescale Layerscape SoCs. The
clock is a simple divider based one and is located inside the device
configuration space (DCFG).

This will allow switching the SCK frequencies for the FlexSPI interface
on the LS1028A and the LX2160A.
