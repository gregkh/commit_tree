x86/sgx: Return -EINVAL on a zero length buffer in sgx_ioc_enclave_add_pages()

The sgx_enclave_add_pages.length field is documented as

 * @length:     length of the data (multiple of the page size)

Fail with -EINVAL, when the caller gives a zero length buffer of data
to be added as pages to an enclave. Right now 'ret' is returned as
uninitialized in that case.
