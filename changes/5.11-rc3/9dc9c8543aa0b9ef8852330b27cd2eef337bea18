USB: core: return -EREMOTEIO on short usb_control_msg_recv()

Return -EREMOTEIO instead of -EINVAL on short control transfers when
using the new usb_control_msg_recv() helper.

EINVAL is used to report invalid arguments (e.g. to the helper) and
should not be used for unrelated errors.

Many driver currently return -EIO on short control transfers but since
host-controller drivers already use -EREMOTEIO for short transfers
whenever the URB_SHORT_NOT_OK flag is set, let's use that here as well.

This also allows usb_control_msg_recv() to eventually use
URB_SHORT_NOT_OK without changing the return value again.
