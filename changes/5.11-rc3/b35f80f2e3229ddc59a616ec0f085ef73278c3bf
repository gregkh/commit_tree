ARM: dts: exynos: Remove interrupts from DMC controller in Exynos5422

The interrupts in Dynamic Memory Controller in Exynos5422 and Odroid
XU3-family boards are no longer needed. They have been used in order
to workaround some issues in scheduled work in devfreq. Now when the
devfreq framework design is improved, remove the interrupt driven
approach and rely on devfreq monitoring mechanism with fixed intervals.
