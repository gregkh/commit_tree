s390/mm: add support to allocate gigantic hugepages using CMA

Commit cf11e85fc08c ("mm: hugetlb: optionally allocate gigantic hugepages
using cma") added support for allocating gigantic hugepages using CMA,
by specifying the hugetlb_cma= kernel parameter, which will disable any
boot-time allocation of gigantic hugepages.

This patch enables that option also for s390.
