ceph: set osdmap epoch for setxattr

When setting the file/dir layout, it may need data pool info. So
in mds server, it needs to check the osdmap. At present, if mds
doesn't find the data pool specified, it will try to get the latest
osdmap. Now if pass the osd epoch for setxattr, the mds server can
only check this epoch of osdmap.
