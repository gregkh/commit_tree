arm64: head.S: rename el2_setup -> init_kernel_el

For a while now el2_setup has performed some basic initialization of EL1
even when the kernel is booted at EL1, so the name is a little
misleading. Further, some comments are stale as with VHE it doesn't drop
the CPU to EL1.

To clarify things, rename el2_setup to init_kernel_el, and update
comments to be clearer as to the function's purpose.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
