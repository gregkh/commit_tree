scftorture: Add an alternative IPI vector

The scftorture tests currently use only smp_call_function() and
friends, which means that these tests cannot locate bugs caused by
interactions between different IPI vectors.  This commit therefore adds
the rescheduling IPI to the mix.

Note that this commit permits resched_cpus() only when scftorture is
built in.  This is a workaround.  Longer term, this will use real wakeups
rather than resched_cpu().
