ASoC: mmp-sspa: set phase two word length register

If hw params enables dual phase transmission, then the word length for
the second phase should be set to match the sample format instead of
remaining at the reset default.  This matches the configuration already
being done for the first phase.

This driver already sets the phase two sample size, so this should complete
the phase two configuration.
