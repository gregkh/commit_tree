ASoC: sun8i-codec: Round up the LRCK divisor

The codec supports only power-of-two BCLK/LRCK divisors. If either the
slot width or the number of slots is not a power of two, the LRCK
divisor must be rounded up to provide enough space. To do that, use
order_base_2 (instead of ilog2, which rounds down).

Since the rounded divisor is also needed for setting the SYSCLK/BCLK
divisor, return the order base 2 instead of fully calculating the
hardware register encoding.
