PCI/PM: Rename pci_wakeup_bus() to pci_resume_bus()

A "wakeup" is a signal from a device telling the system that the device or
the whole system should be awakened and made active.  PCI devices are made
active by "resuming" them.

pci_wakeup_bus() is not involved with the wakeup signal; it *resumes*
devices on a bus (possibly in response to a wakeup signal, but that's at a
higher level).

Rename pci_wakeup_bus() to pci_resume_bus() to better reflect what it does.
No functional change intended.
