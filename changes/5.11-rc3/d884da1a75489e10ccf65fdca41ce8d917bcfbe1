iio:light:tsl2563 use generic fw accessors

Replace of_property_read_u32() with device_property_read_u32(),
when reading the amstaos,cover-comp-gain.This opens up the
possibility of passing the properties during platform instantiation
of the device by a suitable populated struct property_entry.
Additionally, a minor change in logic is added to remove the
of_node present check.
