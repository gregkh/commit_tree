ALSA: usb-audio: Fix MOTU M-Series quirks

Now that the usb audio driver correctly finds implicit feedback endpoints,
the implicit feedback quirk for the MOTU M-Series is no longer required.

This also removes some unnecessary vendor specific messages from the MOTU
M-Series boot quirk. The removed vendor specific messages turned on vendor
specific interrupts to the host every 32 samples. The only thing the boot
quirk needs to do is wait for 2 seconds.
