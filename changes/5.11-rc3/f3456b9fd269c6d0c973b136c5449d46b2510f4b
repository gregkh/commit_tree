crypto: arm/aes-ce - work around Cortex-A57/A72 silion errata

ARM Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A72 cores running in 32-bit mode are affected
by silicon errata #1742098 and #1655431, respectively, where the second
instruction of a AES instruction pair may execute twice if an interrupt
is taken right after the first instruction consumes an input register of
which a single 32-bit lane has been updated the last time it was modified.

This is not such a rare occurrence as it may seem: in counter mode, only
the least significant 32-bit word is incremented in the absence of a
carry, which makes our counter mode implementation susceptible to these
errata.

So let's shuffle the counter assignments around a bit so that the most
recent updates when the AES instruction pair executes are 128-bit wide.
