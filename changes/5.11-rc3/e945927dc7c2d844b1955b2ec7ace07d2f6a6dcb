firmware: arm_scmi: Remove residual _le structs naming

For sake of consistency, remove any residual naming based on _le
suffixes in SCMI sensors protocol, since little endianness is already
assumed across all of SCMI implementation and, as such, all currently
existent names do not explicitly state their endianness.

No functional change.
