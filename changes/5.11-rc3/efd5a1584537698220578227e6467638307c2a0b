net: hns3: fix expression that is currently always true

The ||  condition in hdev->fd_active_type != HCLGE_FD_ARFS_ACTIVE ||
hdev->fd_active_type != HCLGE_FD_RULE_NONE will always be true because
hdev->fd_active_type cannot be equal to two different values at the same
time. The expression is always true which is not correct. Fix this by
replacing || with && to correct the logic in the expression.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Constant expression result")
