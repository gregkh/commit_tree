mtd: spinand: Move ECC related definitions earlier in the driver

Prepare the creation of a SPI-NAND on-die ECC engine by gathering the
ECC-related code earlier enough in the core to avoid the need for
forward declarations.

The next step is to actually create that engine by implementing the
generic ECC interface.
