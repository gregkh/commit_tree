drm/panel/samsung-sofef00: Add panel for OnePlus 6/T devices

The OnePlus 6/T devices use different panels however they are
functionally identical with the only differences being the resolution.
The panels also don't seem to be used by any other devices, just combine
them into one driver.

The panels are: samsung,sofef00
and             samsung,s6e3fc2x01
