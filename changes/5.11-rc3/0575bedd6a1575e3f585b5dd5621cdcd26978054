drivers: net: sky2: Fix -Wstringop-truncation with W=1

In function ‘strncpy’,
    inlined from ‘sky2_name’ at drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/sky2.c:4903:3,
    inlined from ‘sky2_probe’ at drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/sky2.c:5049:2:
./include/linux/string.h:297:30: warning: ‘__builtin_strncpy’ specified bound 16 equals destination size [-Wstringop-truncation]

None of the device names are 16 characters long, so it was never an
issue. But replace the strncpy with an snprintf() to prevent the
theoretical overflow.
