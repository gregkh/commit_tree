auxdisplay: Change gotoxy calling interface

Change the calling interface for gotoxy from supplying the x and y
coordinates in the charlcd struct to explicitly supplying x and y in
the function arguments. This is more intuitive and allows for moving
the cursor to positions independent from the position saved in the
charlcd struct.
