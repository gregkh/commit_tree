ALSA: usb-audio: Avoid doubly initialization for implicit fb

The implicit feedback mode initializes both the main data stream and
the sync data stream.  When a sync stream was already opened, this
would result in the doubly initialization and might screw up things.

Add the check of already opened sync streams and skip the unnecessary
initialization.
