drm/msm/dp: skip checking LINK_STATUS_UPDATED bit

Some dongle will not clear LINK_STATUS_UPDATED bit after
DPCD read which cause link training failed. This patch
just read 6 bytes of DPCD link status from sink and return
without checking LINK_STATUS_UPDATED bit.
Only 8 bits are used to represent link rate at sinker DPCD.
The really link rate is 2.7Mb times the 8 bits value.
For example, 0x0A at DPCD is equal to 2.7Gb (10 * 2.7Mb).
This patch also convert 8 bits value of DPCD to really link
rate to fix worng link rate error during phy compliance test.
