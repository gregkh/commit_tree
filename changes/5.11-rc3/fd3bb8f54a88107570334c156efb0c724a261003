nvmem: core: Add support for keepout regions

Introduce support into the nvmem core for arrays of register ranges
that should not result in actual device access. For these regions a
constant byte (repeated) is returned instead on read, and writes are
quietly ignored and returned as successful.

This is useful for instance if certain efuse regions are protected
from access by Linux because they contain secret info to another part
of the system (like an integrated modem).
