arm64: mm: extend linear region for 52-bit VA configurations

For historical reasons, the arm64 kernel VA space is configured as two
equally sized halves, i.e., on a 48-bit VA build, the VA space is split
into a 47-bit vmalloc region and a 47-bit linear region.

When support for 52-bit virtual addressing was added, this equal split
was kept, resulting in a substantial waste of virtual address space in
the linear region:

As illustrated above, the 52-bit VA kernel uses 47 bits for the vmalloc
space (as before), to ensure that a single 64k granule kernel image can
support any 64k granule capable system, regardless of whether it supports
the 52-bit virtual addressing extension. However, due to the fact that
the VA space is still split in equal halves, the linear region is only
2^51 bytes in size, wasting almost half of the 52-bit VA space.

Let's fix this, by abandoning the equal split, and simply assigning all
VA space outside of the vmalloc region to the linear region.

The KASAN shadow region is reconfigured so that it ends at the start of
the vmalloc region, and grows downwards. That way, the arrangement of
the vmalloc space (which contains kernel mappings, modules, BPF region,
the vmemmap array etc) is identical between non-KASAN and KASAN builds,
which aids debugging.
