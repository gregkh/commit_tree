ext4: fix a memory leak of ext4_free_data

When freeing metadata, we will create an ext4_free_data and
insert it into the pending free list.  After the current
transaction is committed, the object will be freed.

ext4_mb_free_metadata() will check whether the area to be freed
overlaps with the pending free list. If true, return directly. At this
time, ext4_free_data is leaked.  Fortunately, the probability of this
problem is small, since it only occurs if the file system is corrupted
such that a block is claimed by more one inode and those inodes are
deleted within a single jbd2 transaction.
