checkpatch: avoid COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE warning for signature tags

Currently checkpatch warns us for long lines in commits even for signature
tag lines.

Generally these lines exceed the 75-character limit because of:

 1) long names and long email address

 2) some comments on scoped review and acknowledgement, i.e., for a
    dedicated pointer on what was reported by the identity in
    'Reported-by'

 3) some additional comments on CC: stable@vger.org tags

Exclude signature tag lines from this class of warning.

There were 1896 COMMIT_LOG_LONG_LINE warnings in v5.6..v5.8 before this
patch application and 1879 afterwards.

A quick manual check found all the dropped warnings related to signature
tags.
