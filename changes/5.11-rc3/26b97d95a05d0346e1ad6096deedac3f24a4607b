ASoC: pcm512x: Move format check into `set_fmt()`

I would like to describe the reasoning by quoting Peter Ujfalusi
<peter.ujfalusi@ti.com> from his review of this patch series v1 [1]:

> When you bind a link you will use set_fmt for the two sides to see if
> they can agree, that both can support what has been asked.
>
> The pcm512x driver just saves the fmt and say back to that card:
> whatever, I'm fine with it. But runtime during hw_params it can fail due
> to unsupported bus format, which it actually acked to be ok.
>
> This is the difference.
>
> Sure, some device have constraint based on the fmt towards the hw_params
> and it is perfectly OK to do such a checks and rejections or build
> rules/constraints based on fmt, but failing hw_params just because
> set_fmt did not checked that the bus format is not even supported is not
> a nice thing to do.
