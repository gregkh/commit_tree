Bluetooth: hci_qca: Wait for timeout during suspend

Currently qca_suspend() is relied on IBS mechanism. During
FW download and memory dump collections, IBS will be disabled.
In those cases, driver will allow suspend and still uses the
serdev port, which results to errors. Now added a wait timeout
if suspend is triggered during FW download and memory collections.
