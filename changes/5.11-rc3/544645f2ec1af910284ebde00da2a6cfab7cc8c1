drm/fourcc: add table describing AMD modifiers bit layout

The table describes how each bit in the u64 value is used. Explicitly
state which values a field can take if we have defines for them. Also
add a note when a field isn't always populated.

Forcing people to update the table when changing the bit layout should
make it more obvious when there's a mistake, I hope.

If we get to the point where the bit layout gets more complicated, it
might be worth it to split the table into multiple tables (e.g. one for
GFX8, one for GFX9+, and so on).
