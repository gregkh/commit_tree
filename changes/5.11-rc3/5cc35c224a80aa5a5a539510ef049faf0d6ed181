usb: gadget: Fix spinlock lockup on usb_function_deactivate

There is a spinlock lockup as part of composite_disconnect
when it tries to acquire cdev->lock as part of usb_gadget_deactivate.
This is because the usb_gadget_deactivate is called from
usb_function_deactivate with the same spinlock held.

This would result in the below call stack and leads to stall.

Fix this by doing an unlock on cdev->lock before the usb_gadget_deactivate
call from usb_function_deactivate.

The same lockup can happen in the usb_gadget_activate path. Fix that path
as well.
