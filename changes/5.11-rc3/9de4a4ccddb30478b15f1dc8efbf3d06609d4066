net: ipa: use version in gsi_channel_reset()

A quirk of IPA v3.5.1 requires a channel reset on an RX channel to
be performed twice.  Use the IPA version in gsi_channel_reset()
rather than the passed-in legacy flag to determine that.

This is actually a bug fix, because this double reset is supposed
to occur independent of whether we're enabling the doorbell engine.
Now they will be independent.
