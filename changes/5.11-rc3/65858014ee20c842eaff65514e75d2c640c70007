scsi: ufs: Introduce device parameter initialization function

Nowadays many vendors initialize their device parameters in their own
vendor drivers. The initialization code is almost the same as well as the
pre-defined definitions. Introduce a common device parameter initialization
function which assign the most common initial values. With this function,
we could remove those duplicated codes in vendor drivers.
