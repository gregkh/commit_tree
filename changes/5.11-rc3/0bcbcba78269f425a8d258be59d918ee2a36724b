drm/i915/display: Program PSR2 selective fetch registers

Another step towards PSR2 selective fetch, here programming plane
selective fetch registers and MAN_TRK_CTL enabling selective fetch but
for now it is fetching the whole area of the planes.
The damaged area calculation will come as next and final step.

v2:
- removed warn on when no plane is visible in state
- removed calculations using plane damaged area in
intel_psr2_program_plane_sel_fetch()

v3:
- do not shift 16 positions the plane dst coordinates, only src is
shifted

v4:
- only setting PLANE_SEL_FETCH_CTL_ENABLE and MCURSOR_MODE in
PLANE_SEL_FETCH_CTL

v5:
- not masking bits for cursor
