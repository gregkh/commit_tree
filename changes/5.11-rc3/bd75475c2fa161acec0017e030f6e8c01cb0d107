NFSv4.2: Fix 5 seconds delay when doing inter server copy

Since commit b4868b44c5628 ("NFSv4: Wait for stateid updates after
CLOSE/OPEN_DOWNGRADE"), every inter server copy operation suffers 5
seconds delay regardless of the size of the copy. The delay is from
nfs_set_open_stateid_locked when the check by nfs_stateid_is_sequential
fails because the seqid in both nfs4_state and nfs4_stateid are 0.

Fix __nfs42_ssc_open to delay setting of NFS_OPEN_STATE in nfs4_state,
until after the call to update_open_stateid, to indicate this is the 1st
open. This fix is part of a 2 patches, the other patch is the fix in the
source server to return the stateid for COPY_NOTIFY request with seqid 1
instead of 0.
