drm/mcde: Fix RGB/BGR bug

I was confused when the graphics came out with blue
penguins on the DPI panel.

It turns out that the so-called "packed RGB666" mode
on the DSI formatter is incorrect: this mode is the
actual RGB888 mode, and the mode called RGB888 is
BGR888.

The claims that the MCDE had inverse RGB/BGR buffer
formats was wrong, so correct this and the buggy
register and everything is much more consistent, and
graphics look good on all targets, both DPI and
DSI.
