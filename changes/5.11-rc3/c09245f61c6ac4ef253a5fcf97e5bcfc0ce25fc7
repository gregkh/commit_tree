blk-iocost: Move the usage ratio calculation to the correct place

We only use the hweight based usage ratio to calculate the new
hweight_inuse of the iocg to decide if this iocg can donate some
surplus vtime.

Thus move the usage ratio calculation to the correct place to
avoid unnecessary calculation for some vtime shortage iocgs.
