btrfs: don't miss async discards after scheduled work override

If btrfs_discard_schedule_work() is called with override=true, it sets
delay anew regardless how much time is left until the timer should have
fired. If delays are long (that can happen, for example, with low
kbps_limit), they might get constantly overridden without having a
chance to run the discard work.
