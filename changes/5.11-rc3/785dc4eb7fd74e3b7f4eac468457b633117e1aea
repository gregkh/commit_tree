audit: Migrate to use SYSCALL_WORK flag

On architectures using the generic syscall entry code the architecture
independent syscall work is moved to flags in thread_info::syscall_work.
This removes architecture dependencies and frees up TIF bits.

Define SYSCALL_WORK_SYSCALL_AUDIT, use it in the generic entry code and
convert the code which uses the TIF specific helper functions to use the
new *_syscall_work() helpers which either resolve to the new mode for users
of the generic entry code or to the TIF based functions for the other
architectures.
