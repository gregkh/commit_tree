arm64: uaccess: move uao_* alternatives to asm-uaccess.h

The uao_* alternative asm macros are only used by the uaccess assembly
routines in arch/arm64/lib/, where they are included indirectly via
asm-uaccess.h. Since they're specific to the uaccess assembly (and will
lose the alternatives in subsequent patches), let's move them into
asm-uaccess.h.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
