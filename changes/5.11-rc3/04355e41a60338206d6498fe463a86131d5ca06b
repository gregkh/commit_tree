KVM: arm64: Set ID_AA64DFR0_EL1.PMUVer to 0 when no PMU support

We always expose the HW view of PMU in ID_AA64FDR0_EL1.PMUver,
even when the PMU feature is disabled, while the architecture
says that FEAT_PMUv3 not being implemented should result in this
field being zero.

Let's follow the architecture's guidance.
