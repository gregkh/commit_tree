samples: bpf: Refactor test_cgrp2_sock2 program with libbpf

This commit refactors the existing cgroup program with libbpf bpf
loader. The original test_cgrp2_sock2 has keeped the bpf program
attached to the cgroup hierarchy even after the exit of user program.
To implement the same functionality with libbpf, this commit uses the
BPF_LINK_PINNING to pin the link attachment even after it is closed.

Since this uses LINK instead of ATTACH, detach of bpf program from
cgroup with 'test_cgrp2_sock' is not used anymore.

The code to mount the bpf was added to the .sh file in case the bpff
was not mounted on /sys/fs/bpf. Additionally, to fix the problem that
shell script cannot find the binary object from the current path,
relative path './' has been added in front of binary.
