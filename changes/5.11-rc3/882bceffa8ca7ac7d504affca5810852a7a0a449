drm/tilcdc: Remove tilcdc_crtc_max_width(), use private data

We already have a private data member for maximum display width so
let's use it and get rid of the redundant tilcdc_crtc_max_width().

The LCDC version probing is moved to before reading the device tree
properties so that the version information is available when private
data maximum width is initialized, if "max-width" property is not
found.
