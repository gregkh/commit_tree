perf/x86: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix a warning
by explicitly adding a fallthrough pseudo-keyword as a replacement for
a /* fall through */ comment, instead of letting the code fall through
to the next case.

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* fall through */ comments as
implicit fall-through markings.
