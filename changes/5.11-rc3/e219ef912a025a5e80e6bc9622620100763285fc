drm/i915: Wait for eDP panel power cycle delay on reboot on all platforms

Extend the eDP panel power cycle delay wait on reboot handling
to cover all platforms. No reason to think that VLV/CHV are
in any way special since the documentation states that the
hardware power cycle delay goes back to its default value on
reset, and that may not be enough for all panels.
