dma-buf: Clarify that dma-buf sg lists are page aligned

The dma-buf API have been used under the assumption that the sg lists
returned from dma_buf_map_attachment() are fully page aligned. Lots of
stuff can break otherwise all over the place. Clarify this in the
documentation and add a check when DMA API debug is enabled.
