arm64: dts: sdm845: Add iommus property to qup

The SMMU that sits in front of the QUP needs to be programmed properly
so that the i2c geni driver can allocate DMA descriptors. Failure to do
this leads to faults when using devices such as an i2c touchscreen where
the transaction is larger than 32 bytes and we use a DMA buffer.

arm-smmu 15000000.iommu: Unexpected global fault, this could be serious
arm-smmu 15000000.iommu:         GFSR 0x00000002, GFSYNR0 0x00000002, GFSYNR1 0x000006c0, GFSYNR2 0x00000000

Add the right SID and mask so this works.
