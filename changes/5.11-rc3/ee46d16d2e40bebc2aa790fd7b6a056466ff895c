drm: mxsfb: Silence -EPROBE_DEFER while waiting for bridge

It can take multiple iterations until all components for an attached DSI
bridge are up leading to several:

[    3.796425] mxsfb 30320000.lcd-controller: Cannot connect bridge: -517
[    3.816952] mxsfb 30320000.lcd-controller: [drm:mxsfb_probe [mxsfb]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge: -517

Silence this by checking for -EPROBE_DEFER and using dev_err_probe() so
we set a deferred reason in case a dependency fails to probe (which
quickly happens on small config/DT changes due to the rather long probe
chain which can include bridges, phys, panels, backights, leds, etc.).

This also removes the only DRM_DEV_ERROR() usage, the rest of the driver
uses dev_err().
