powerpc/pseries/hibernation: switch to rtas_ibm_suspend_me()

rtas_suspend_last_cpu() and related code perform a lot of work that
isn't relevant to the hibernation workflow. All other CPUs are offline
when called so there is no need to place them in H_JOIN or prod them
on resume, nor is there need for retries or operations on shared
state.

Call the rtas_ibm_suspend_me() wrapper function directly from
pseries_suspend_enter() instead of using rtas_suspend_last_cpu().
