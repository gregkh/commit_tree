powerpc/ptrace: Consolidate reg index calculation

Today we have:

	#ifdef CONFIG_PPC32
		index = addr >> 2;
		if ((addr & 3) || child->thread.regs == NULL)
	#else
		index = addr >> 3;
		if ((addr & 7))
	#endif

sizeof(long) has value 4 for PPC32 and value 8 for PPC64.

Dividing by 4 is equivalent to >> 2 and dividing by 8 is equivalent
to >> 3.

And 3 and 7 are respectively (sizeof(long) - 1).

Use sizeof(long) to get rid of the #ifdef CONFIG_PPC32 and consolidate
the calculation and checking.

thread.regs have to be not NULL on both PPC32 and PPC64 so adding
that test on PPC64 is harmless.
