net: macb: Correct usage of MACB_CAPS_CLK_HW_CHG flag

A new flag MACB_CAPS_CLK_HW_CHG was added and all callers of
macb_set_tx_clk were gated on the presence of this flag.

-   if (!clk)
+ if (!bp->tx_clk || !(bp->caps & MACB_CAPS_CLK_HW_CHG))

However the flag was not added to anything other than the new
sama7g5_gem, turning that function call into a no op for all other
systems. This breaks the networking on Zynq.

The commit message adding this states: a new capability so that
macb_set_tx_clock() to not be called for IPs having this
capability

This strongly implies that present of the flag was intended to skip
the function not absence of the flag. Update the if statement to
this effect, which repairs the existing users.
