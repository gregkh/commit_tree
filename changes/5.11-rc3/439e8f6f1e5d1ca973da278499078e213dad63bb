w1: w1_therm: Rename conflicting sysfs attribute 'eeprom' to 'eeprom_cmd'

Duplicate attribute 'eeprom' is defined in:
1) Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-driver-w1_therm
2) Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-driver-w1_ds28e04

Both drivers define an attribute: /sys/bus/w1/devices/.../eeprom
with conflicting behavior.

Fix by renaming the newer one in w1_therm.c to 'eeprom_cmd'.
