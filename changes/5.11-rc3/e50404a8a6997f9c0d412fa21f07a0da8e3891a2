btrfs: discard: speed up async discard up to iops_limit

Instead of using iops_limit only for cutting off extremes, calculate the
discard delay directly from it, so it closely follows iops_limit and
doesn't under-discard even though quotas are not saturated.

The iops limit could be hit more often in some cases and could increase
the discard rate.
