mfd: ab8500-debugfs: Remove extraneous seq_putc

Commit c9a3c4e637ac ("mfd: ab8500-debugfs: Remove extraneous curly
brace") removed a left-over curly brace that caused build failures, but
Joe Perches points out that the subsequent 'seq_putc()' should also be
removed, because the commit that caused all these problems already added
the final '\n' to the seq_printf() above it.
