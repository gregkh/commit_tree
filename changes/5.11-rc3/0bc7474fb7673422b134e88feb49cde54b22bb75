psci: Split functions to v0.1 and v0.2+ variants

Refactor implementation of v0.1+ functions (CPU_SUSPEND, CPU_OFF,
CPU_ON, MIGRATE) to have two functions psci_0_1_foo / psci_0_2_foo that
select the function ID and call a common helper __psci_foo.

This is a small cleanup so that the function ID array is only used for
v0.1 configurations.
