iwlwifi: dvm: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix multiple
warnings by explicitly using the fallthrough pseudo-keyword as a
replacement for a number of "fall through" markings.

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize "fall through" comments as
implicit fall-through.
