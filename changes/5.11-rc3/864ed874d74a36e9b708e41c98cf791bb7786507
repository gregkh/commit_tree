media: camss: ispif: Correctly reset based on the VFE ID

Resetting the ISPIF VFE0 context is wrong if we are using the VFE1
for dual-camera or simply because a secondary camera is connected
to it: in this case the reset will always happen on the VFE0 ctx
of the ISPIF, which is .. useless.

Fix this usecase by adding the ISPIF_RST_CMD_1 address and choose
where to do the (or what to) reset based on the VFE line id.
