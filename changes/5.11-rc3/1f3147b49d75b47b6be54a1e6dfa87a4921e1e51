mm: slub: call account_slab_page() after slab page initialization

It's convenient to have page->objects initialized before calling into
account_slab_page().  In particular, this information can be used to
pre-alloc the obj_cgroup vector.

Let's call account_slab_page() a bit later, after the initialization of
page->objects.

This commit doesn't bring any functional change, but is required for
further optimizations.
