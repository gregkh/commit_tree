media: dt-bindings: mipi-ccs: Add bus-type for C-PHY support

The bus-type property is required for C-PHY support. Add it, including
values for CCP2 and CSI-2 D-PHY.

Also require the bus-type property. Effectively all new sensors are MIPI
D-PHY or C-PHY that cannot be told apart without the bus-type property.
