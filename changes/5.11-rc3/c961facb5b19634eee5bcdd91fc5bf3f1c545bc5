HID: ite: Add support for Acer S1002 keyboard-dock

Make the hid-ite driver handle the Acer S1002 keyboard-dock, this
leads to 2 improvements:

1. The non working wifi-toggle hotkey now works.
2. Toggling the touchpad on of with the hotkey will no show OSD
notifications in e.g. GNOME3. The actual toggling is handled inside
the keyboard, this adds support for notifying evdev listeners about this.
