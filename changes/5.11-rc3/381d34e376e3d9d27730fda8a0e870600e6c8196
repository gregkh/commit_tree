scsi: megaraid_sas: Check user-provided offsets

It sounds unwise to let user space pass an unchecked 32-bit offset into a
kernel structure in an ioctl. This is an unsigned variable, so checking the
upper bound for the size of the structure it points into is sufficient to
avoid data corruption, but as the pointer might also be unaligned, it has
to be written carefully as well.

While I stumbled over this problem by reading the code, I did not continue
checking the function for further problems like it.
