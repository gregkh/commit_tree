tools: selftests: add test for changing routes with PTMU exceptions

Adds new 2 new tests to the PTMU script: pmtu_ipv4/6_route_change.

These tests explicitly test for a recently discovered problem in the
IPv6 routing framework where PMTU exceptions were not properly released
when replacing a route via "ip route change ...".

After creating PMTU exceptions, the route from the device A to R1 will be
replaced with a new route, then device A will be deleted. If the PMTU
exceptions were properly cleaned up by the kernel, this device deletion
will succeed. Otherwise, the unregistration of the device will stall, and
messages such as the following will be logged in dmesg:

unregister_netdevice: waiting for veth_A-R1 to become free. Usage count = 4
