bpf: Implement task local storage

Similar to bpf_local_storage for sockets and inodes add local storage
for task_struct.

The life-cycle of storage is managed with the life-cycle of the
task_struct.  i.e. the storage is destroyed along with the owning task
with a callback to the bpf_task_storage_free from the task_free LSM
hook.

The BPF LSM allocates an __rcu pointer to the bpf_local_storage in
the security blob which are now stackable and can co-exist with other
LSMs.

The userspace map operations can be done by using a pid fd as a key
passed to the lookup, update and delete operations.
