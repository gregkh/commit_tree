mm: move lruvec stats update functions to vmstat.h

Patch series "memcg: add pagetable comsumption to memory.stat", v2.

Many workloads consumes significant amount of memory in pagetables.  One
specific use-case is the user space network driver which mmaps the
application memory to provide zero copy transfer.  This driver can consume
a large amount memory in page tables.  This patch series exposes the
pagetable comsumption for each memory cgroup.

This patch (of 2):

This does not change any functionality and only move the functions which
update the lruvec stats to vmstat.h from memcontrol.h.  The main reason
for this patch is to be able to use these functions in the page table
contructor function which is defined in mm.h and we can not include the
memcontrol.h in that file.  Also this is a better place for this interface
in general.  The lruvec abstraction, while invented for memcg, isn't
specific to memcg at all.
