epoll: convert internal api to timespec64

Patch series "add epoll_pwait2 syscall", v4.

Enable nanosecond timeouts for epoll.

Analogous to pselect and ppoll, introduce an epoll_wait syscall
variant that takes a struct timespec instead of int timeout.

This patch (of 4):

Make epoll more consistent with select/poll: pass along the timeout as
timespec64 pointer.

In anticipation of additional changes affecting all three polling
mechanisms:

- add epoll_pwait2 syscall with timespec semantics,
  and share poll_select_set_timeout implementation.
- compute slack before conversion to absolute time,
  to save one ktime_get_ts64 call.
