iommu/arm-smmu: Add a way for implementations to influence SCTLR

For the Adreno GPU's SMMU, we want SCTLR.HUPCF set to ensure that
pending translations are not terminated on iova fault.  Otherwise
a terminated CP read could hang the GPU by returning invalid
command-stream data. Add a hook to for the implementation to modify
the sctlr value if it wishes.
