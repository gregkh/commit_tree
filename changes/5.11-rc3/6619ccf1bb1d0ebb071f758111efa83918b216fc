dma-buf: Use struct dma_buf_map in dma_buf_vmap() interfaces

This patch updates dma_buf_vmap() and dma-buf's vmap callback to use
struct dma_buf_map.

The interfaces used to return a buffer address. This address now gets
stored in an instance of the structure that is given as an additional
argument. The functions return an errno code on errors.

Users of the functions are updated accordingly. This is only an interface
change. It is currently expected that dma-buf memory can be accessed with
system memory load/store operations.

v3:
	* update fastrpc driver (kernel test robot)
v2:
	* always clear map parameter in dma_buf_vmap() (Daniel)
	* include dma-buf-heaps and i915 selftests (kernel test robot)
