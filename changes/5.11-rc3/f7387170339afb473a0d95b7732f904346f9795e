writeback: don't warn on an unregistered BDI in __mark_inode_dirty

BDIs get unregistered during device removal, and this WARN can be
trivially triggered by hot-removing a NVMe device while running fsx
It is otherwise harmless as we still hold a BDI reference, and the
writeback has been shut down already.
