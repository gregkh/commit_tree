KVM: selftests: Verify supported CR4 bits can be set before KVM_SET_CPUID2

Extend the KVM_SET_SREGS test to verify that all supported CR4 bits, as
enumerated by KVM, can be set before KVM_SET_CPUID2, i.e. without first
defining the vCPU model.  KVM is supposed to skip guest CPUID checks
when host userspace is stuffing guest state.

Check the inverse as well, i.e. that KVM rejects KVM_SET_REGS if CR4
has one or more unsupported bits set.
