drm/meson: dw-hdmi: Enable the iahb clock early enough

Instead of moving meson_dw_hdmi_init() around which breaks existing
platform, let's enable the clock meson_dw_hdmi_init() depends on.
This means we don't have to worry about this clock being enabled or
not, depending on the boot-loader features.
