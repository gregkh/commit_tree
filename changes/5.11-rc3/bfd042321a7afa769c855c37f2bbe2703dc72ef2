bridge: mrp: Implement LC mode for MRP

Extend MRP to support LC mode(link check) for the interconnect port.
This applies only to the interconnect ring.

Opposite to RC mode(ring check) the LC mode is using CFM frames to
detect when the link goes up or down and based on that the userspace
will need to react.
One advantage of the LC mode over RC mode is that there will be fewer
frames in the normal rings. Because RC mode generates InTest on all
ports while LC mode sends CFM frame only on the interconnect port.

All 4 nodes part of the interconnect ring needs to have the same mode.
And it is not possible to have running LC and RC mode at the same time
on a node.

Whenever the MIM starts it needs to detect the status of the other 3
nodes in the interconnect ring so it would send a frame called
InLinkStatus, on which the clients needs to reply with their link
status.

This patch adds InLinkStatus frame type and extends existing rules on
how to forward this frame.
