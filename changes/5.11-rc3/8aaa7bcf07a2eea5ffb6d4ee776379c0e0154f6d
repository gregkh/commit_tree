scsi: lpfc: Add FDMI Vendor MIB support

Created new attribute lpfc_enable_mi, which by default is enabled.

Add command definition bits for SLI-4 parameters that recognize whether the
adapter has MIB information support and what revision of MIB data.  Using
the adapter information, register vendor-specific MIB support with FDMI.
The registration will be done every link up.

During FDMI registration, encountered a couple of errors when reverting to
FDMI rev1. Code needed to exist once reverting. Fixed these.
