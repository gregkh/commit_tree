scsi: target: Fix LUN ref count handling

Fix two bugs in the LUN refcounting:

 1. For the TCM_WRITE_PROTECTED case we were returning an error after
    taking a ref to the LUN, but never dropping it (caller just send status
    and drops cmd ref).

 2. We still need to do a percpu_ref_tryget_live for the virt LUN 0 like we
    do for other LUNs, because the TPG code does the refcount/wait process
    like it does with other LUNs.
