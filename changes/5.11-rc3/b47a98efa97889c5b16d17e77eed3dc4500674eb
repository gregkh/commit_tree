RDMA/core: Track device memory MRs

Device memory (DM) are registered as MR during initialization flow, these
MRs were not tracked by resource tracker and had res->valid set as a
false. Update the code to manage them too.

Before this change:
$ ibv_rc_pingpong -j &
$ rdma res show mr <-- shows nothing

After this change:
$ ibv_rc_pingpong -j &
$ rdma res show mr
dev ibp0s9 mrn 0 mrlen 4096 pdn 3 pid 734 comm ibv_rc_pingpong
