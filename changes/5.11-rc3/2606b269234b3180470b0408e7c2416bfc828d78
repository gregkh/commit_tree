drm/i915/dg1: Define MOCS table for DG1

DG1 has a new MOCS table. We still use the old definition of the table,
but as for any dgfx card it doesn't contain the control_value values
(these values don't matter as we won't program them).

Bspec: 45101

v2: Reword the comment to state that the last few entries are reserved
    instead of "the last two". DG1 reserves four instead of two from
    previous platforms (from Matt Roper)
