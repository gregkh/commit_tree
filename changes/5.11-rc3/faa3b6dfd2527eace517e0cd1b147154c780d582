ARM: dts: imx6q-icore-ofcap10: Use 10.1" Ampire panel compatible

Adding display timings directly on device tree files make it difficult
to maintain as a same copy of timings may exist on different files or
panel-simple driver.

We have a panel-simple driver for this particular usage so supporting
on this driver will help to use the same timings on any device tree
files if the board mounted on a similar vendor display.

Engicam C.TOUCH OF 10.1" LCD board uses Ampire 10.1" TFT LCD and
it has supported by panel-simple already, so simply use that binding.
