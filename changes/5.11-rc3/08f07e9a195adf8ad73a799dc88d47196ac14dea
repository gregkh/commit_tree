ARM: dts: stm32: update sdmmc IP version for STM32MP15

Update the IP version to v2.0, which supports linked lists in internal DMA,
and is present in STM32MP1 SoCs.

The mmci driver supports the v2.0 periph id since 7a2a98be672b ("mmc: mmci:
Add support for sdmmc variant revision 2.0"), so it's now Ok to add it into
the SoC device tree to benefit from the improved DMA support.
