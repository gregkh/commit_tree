USB: serial: cp210x: set terminal settings on open

Unlike other drivers cp210x have been retrieving the current terminal
settings from the device on open and reflecting those in termios.

Due to how set_termios() used to be implemented, this saved a few
control requests on open but has instead caused problems like broken
flow control and has required adding workarounds for swapped
line-control in cp2108 and line-speed initialisation on cp2104.

This unusual implementation also complicates adding new features for no
good reason.

Rip out the corresponding code and the above mentioned workarounds and
instead initialise the terminal settings unconditionally on open.
