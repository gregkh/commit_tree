mac80211: assure that certain drivers adhere to DONT_REORDER flag

Some drivers use skb->priority to determine on which queue to send
a frame. An example is mt76x2u (this was tested on an AWUS036ACM).
This means these drivers currently do not adhere to the DONT_REORDER
flag. To fix this, we do not set skb->priority based on the QoS TID
of injected frames when the DONT_REORDER flag is set.
