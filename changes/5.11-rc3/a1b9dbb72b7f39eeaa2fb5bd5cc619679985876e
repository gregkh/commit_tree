docs: RCU: Requirements.rst: Fix a list block

As warned by Sphinx:
	.../Documentation/RCU/Design/Requirements/Requirements.rst:1959: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.

The list block is missing a space before it, making Sphinx to get
it wrong.  This commit therefore adds the missing space characters.
