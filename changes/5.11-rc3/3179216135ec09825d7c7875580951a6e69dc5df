fuse: setattr should set FATTR_KILL_SUIDGID

If fc->handle_killpriv_v2 is enabled, we expect file server to clear
suid/sgid/security.capbility upon chown/truncate/write as appropriate.

Upon truncate (ATTR_SIZE), suid/sgid are cleared only if caller does not
have CAP_FSETID.  File server does not know whether caller has CAP_FSETID
or not.  Hence set FATTR_KILL_SUIDGID upon truncate to let file server know
that caller does not have CAP_FSETID and it should kill suid/sgid as
appropriate.

On chown (ATTR_UID/ATTR_GID) suid/sgid need to be cleared irrespective of
capabilities of calling process, so set FATTR_KILL_SUIDGID unconditionally
in that case.
