xprtrdma: Trace unmap_sync calls

->buf_free is called nearly once per RPC. Only rarely does
xprt_rdma_free() have to do anything, thus tracing every one of
these calls seems unnecessary. Instead, just throw a trace event
when that one occasional RPC still has MRs that need to be
released.

xprt_rdma_free() is further micro-optimized to reduce the amount of
work done in the common case.
