KVM: arm64: Add AArch32 mapping annotation

In order to deal with the few AArch32 system registers that map to
only a particular half of their AArch64 counterpart (such as DFAR
and IFAR being colocated in FAR_EL1), let's add an optional annotation
to the sysreg descriptor structure, indicating whether a register
maps to the upper or lower 32bits of a register.

Nothing is using these annotation yet.
