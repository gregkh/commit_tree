drm/atomic: document and enforce rules around "spurious" EBUSY

When doing an atomic modeset with ALLOW_MODESET drivers are allowed to
pull in arbitrary other resources, including CRTCs (e.g. when
reconfiguring global resources).

But in nonblocking mode userspace has then no idea this happened,
which can lead to spurious EBUSY calls, both:
- when that other CRTC is currently busy doing a page_flip the
  ALLOW_MODESET commit can fail with an EBUSY
- on the other CRTC a normal atomic flip can fail with EBUSY because
  of the additional commit inserted by the kernel without userspace's
  knowledge

For blocking commits this isn't a problem, because everyone else will
just block until all the CRTC are reconfigured. Only thing userspace
can notice is the dropped frames without any reason for why frames got
dropped.

Consensus is that we need new uapi to handle this properly, but no one
has any idea what exactly the new uapi should look like. Since this
has been shipping for years already compositors need to deal no matter
what, so as a first step just try to enforce this across drivers
better with some checks.

v2: Add comments and a WARN_ON to enforce this only when allowed - we
don't want to silently convert page flips into blocking plane updates
just because the driver is buggy.

v3: Fix inverted WARN_ON (Pekka).

v4: Drop the uapi changes, only add a WARN_ON for now to enforce some
rules for drivers.

v5: Make the WARNING more informative (Daniel)

v6: Add unconditional debug output for compositor hackers to figure
out what's going on when they get an EBUSY (Daniel)

v7: Fix up old/new_crtc_state confusion for real (Pekka/Ville)
