drm/amd/display: Add BLNDGAM memory shutdown support

[Why]
The BLNDGAM memory blocks should be powered down when they're not in
use. This will reduce power consumption.

[How]
1. Write to BLNDGAM_MEM_PWR_FORCE to put memory to shutdown when BLNDGAM
   is not used.
2. Added a debug option to allow this behaviour to be turned off
