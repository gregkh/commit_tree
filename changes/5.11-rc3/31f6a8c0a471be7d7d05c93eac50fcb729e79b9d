sched/topology,schedutil: Wrap sched domains rebuild

Add the rebuild_sched_domains_energy() function to wrap the functionality
that rebuilds the scheduling domains if any of the Energy Aware Scheduling
(EAS) initialisation conditions change. This functionality is used when
schedutil is added or removed or when EAS is enabled or disabled
through the sched_energy_aware sysctl.

Therefore, create a single function that is used in both these cases and
that can be later reused.
