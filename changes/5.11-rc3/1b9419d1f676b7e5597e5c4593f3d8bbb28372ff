staging: trivial: hikey9xx: fix be32<->u32 casting warnings

This patch fixes the following warnings reported by sparse, by adding
missing __force annotations.

drivers/staging/hikey9xx/hisi-spmi-controller.c:164:24: warning: cast to restricted __be32
drivers/staging/hikey9xx/hisi-spmi-controller.c:164:24: warning: cast to restricted __be32

drivers/staging/hikey9xx/hisi-spmi-controller.c:164:24: warning: cast to restricted __be32

drivers/staging/hikey9xx/hisi-spmi-controller.c:239:25: warning: cast from restricted __be32

Rationale for #164:
data is declared as u32, and it is read and then converted by means of
be32_to_cpu(). Said function expects a __be32 but data is u32, therefore
there's a type missmatch here.

Rationale for #239:
Is the dual of #164. This time data going to be  written so it
needs to be converted from cpu to __be32, but writel() expects u32 and the
output of cpu_to_be32 returns a __be32.
