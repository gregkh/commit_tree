mm: cma: improve pr_debug log in cma_release()

It is required to print 'count' of pages, along with the pages, passed to
cma_release to debug the cases of mismatched count value passed between
cma_alloc() and cma_release() from a code path.

As an example, consider the below scenario:

1) CMA pool size is 4MB and

2) User doing the erroneous step of allocating 2 pages but freeing 1
   page in a loop from this CMA pool.  The step 2 causes cma_alloc() to
   return NULL at one point of time because of -ENOMEM condition.

And the current pr_debug logs is not giving the info about these types of
allocation patterns because of count value not being printed in
cma_release().

We are printing the count value in the trace logs, just extend the same to
pr_debug logs too.
