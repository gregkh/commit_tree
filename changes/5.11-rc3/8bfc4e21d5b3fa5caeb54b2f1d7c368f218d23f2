net: ipa: add support to code for IPA v4.5

Update the IPA code to make use of the updated IPA v4.5 register
definitions.  Generally what this patch does is, if IPA v4.5
hardware is in use:
  - Ensure new registers or fields in IPA v4.5 are updated where
    required
  - Ensure registers or fields not supported in IPA v4.5 are not
    examined when read, or are set to 0 when written
It does this while preserving the existing functionality for IPA
versions lower than v4.5.

The values to program for QSB_MAX_READS and QSB_MAX_WRITES and the
source and destination resource counts are updated to be correct for
all versions through v4.5 as well.

Note that IPA_RESOURCE_GROUP_SRC_MAX and IPA_RESOURCE_GROUP_DST_MAX
already reflect that 5 is an acceptable number of resources (which
IPA v4.5 implements).
