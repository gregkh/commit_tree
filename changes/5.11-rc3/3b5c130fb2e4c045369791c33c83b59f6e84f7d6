crypto: qat - fix status check in qat_hal_put_rel_rd_xfer()

The return value of qat_hal_rd_ae_csr() is always a CSR value and never
a status and should not be stored in the status variable of
qat_hal_put_rel_rd_xfer().

This removes the assignment as qat_hal_rd_ae_csr() is not expected to
fail.
A more comprehensive handling of the theoretical corner case which could
result in a fail will be submitted in a separate patch.
