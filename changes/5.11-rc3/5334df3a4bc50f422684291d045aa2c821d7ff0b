ARM: dts: exynos: Add interconnect properties to Exynos4412 bus nodes

This patch adds the following properties for Exynos4412 interconnect
bus nodes:
 - interconnects: to declare connections between nodes in order to
   guarantee PM QoS requirements between nodes,
 - #interconnect-cells: required by the interconnect framework,
 - samsung,data-clk-ratio: which allows to specify minimum data clock
   frequency corresponding to requested bandwidth for each bus.

Note that #interconnect-cells is always zero and node IDs are not
hardcoded anywhere.
