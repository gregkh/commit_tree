Revert "Revert "scsi: megaraid_sas: Added support for shared host tagset for cpuhotplug""

This reverts commit 1a0e1943d8798cb3241fb5edb9a836af1611b60a.

Commit b3c6a5997541 ("block: Fix a lockdep complaint triggered by
request queue flushing") has been reverted and commit fb01a2932e81 has
been introduced in its place. Consequently, it is now safe to
reinstate the megaraid_sas tagset changes that led to boot problems in
5.10.
