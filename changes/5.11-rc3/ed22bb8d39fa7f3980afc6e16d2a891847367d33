powerpc/pseries/hibernation: remove pseries_suspend_cpu()

Since commit 48f6e7f6d948 ("powerpc/pseries: remove cede offline state
for CPUs"), ppc_md.suspend_disable_cpu() is no longer used and all
CPUs (save one) are placed into true offline state as opposed to
H_JOIN. So pseries_suspend_cpu() is effectively unused; remove it.
