drm/vram-helper: Set object function iff they are not provided by driver

Don't override the GEM object functions unconditionally. If the driver
sets the GEM functions, VRAM helpers will not set them. The idea has been
taken from SHMEM helpers.

v2:
	* updated the commit message (Sam)
	* document the new feature for drm_gem_vram_create()
