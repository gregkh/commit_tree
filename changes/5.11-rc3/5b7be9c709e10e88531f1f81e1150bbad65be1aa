ring-buffer: Add test to validate the time stamp deltas

While debugging a situation where a delta for an event was calucalted wrong,
I realize there was nothing making sure that the delta of events are
correct. If a single event has an incorrect delta, then all events after it
will also have one. If the discrepency gets large enough, it could cause
the time stamps to go backwards when crossing sub buffers, that record a
full 64 bit time stamp, and the new deltas are added to that.

Add a way to validate the events at most events and when crossing a buffer
page. This will help make sure that the deltas are always correct. This test
will detect if they are ever corrupted.

The test adds a high overhead to the ring buffer recording, as it does the
audit for almost every event, and should only be used for testing the ring
buffer.

This will catch the bug that is fixed by commit 55ea4cf40380 ("ring-buffer:
Update write stamp with the correct ts"), which is not applied when this
commit is applied.
