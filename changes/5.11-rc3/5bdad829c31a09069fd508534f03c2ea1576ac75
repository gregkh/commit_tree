crypto: crypto4xx - Replace bitwise OR with logical OR in crypto4xx_build_pd

It looks like this should have been a logical OR so that
PD_CTL_HASH_FINAL gets added to the w bitmask if crypto_tfm_alg_type
is either CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AHASH or CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_AEAD. Change the
operator so that everything works properly.
