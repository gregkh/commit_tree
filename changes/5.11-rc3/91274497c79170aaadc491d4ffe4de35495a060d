clk: at91: sama7g5: fix compilation error

pmc_data_allocate() has been changed. pmc_data_free() was removed.
Adapt the code taking this into consideration. With this the programmable
clocks were also saved in sama7g5_pmc so that they could be later
referenced.

Fixes: cb783bbbcf54 ("clk: at91: sama7g5: add clock support for sama7g5")
