selftests/vm: 2x speedup for run_vmtests.sh

Each invocation of userfaultfd for "anon" and "shmem" was taking about
6.5 sec to run, contributing to an overall run time of about 22 sec for
run_vmtests.sh.

Reduce the size and bounce input values to the userfaultfd invocation
within run_vmtests.sh, enough to get each invocation down to about 1.0
sec. This should still provide a reasonable smoke test, while staying
within a nominal time budget of around 1 second or so per test. And this
brings the overall running time of run_vmtests.sh down to 11 second.
