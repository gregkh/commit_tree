ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix speaker volume control on Lenovo C940

Cannot adjust speaker's volume on Lenovo C940.
Applying the alc298_fixup_speaker_volume function can fix the issue.

[ Additional note: C940 has I2S amp for the speaker and this needs the
  same initialization as Dell machines.
  The patch was slightly modified so that the quirk entry is moved
  next to the corresponding Dell quirk entry. -- tiwai ]
