media: staging: rkisp1: remove unecessary clocks

aclk_isp_wrap is a child of aclk_isp, and hclk_isp_wrap is a child of
hclk_isp, thus we can remove parents from the list.

Also, for the isp0, we only need the ISP clock, ACLK and HCLK.
In the future we'll need a pixel clock for RK3288 and RK3399, and a JPEG
clock for RK3288.

So with the goal to cleanup the dt-bindings and remove it from staging,
simplify clock names to isp, aclk and hclk.

Assigned clocks are meant to refer to the full path in the clock tree,
i.e. the leaf in the tree.
For instance, in RK3399, the clock responsible for ACLK (ISP AXI CLOCK)
is aclk_isp0_wrapper.

For reference, this is the isp clock topology on RK3399:

 xin24m
    pll_npll
       npll
          clk_isp1
          clk_isp0
    pll_cpll
       cpll
          aclk_isp1
             aclk_isp1_noc
             hclk_isp1
                aclk_isp1_wrapper
                hclk_isp1_noc
          aclk_isp0
             hclk_isp1_wrapper
             aclk_isp0_wrapper
             aclk_isp0_noc
             hclk_isp0
                hclk_isp0_wrapper
                hclk_isp0_noc
 pclkin_isp1_wrapper
