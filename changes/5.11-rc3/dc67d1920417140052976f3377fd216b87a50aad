perf test: Make sample-parsing test aware of PERF_SAMPLE_{CODE,DATA}_PAGE_SIZE

To fix this:

  $ perf test -v 27
  27: Sample parsing                                                  :
  --- start ---
  test child forked, pid 586013
  sample format has changed, some new PERF_SAMPLE_ bit was introduced - test needs updating
  test child finished with -1
  ---- end ----
  Sample parsing: FAILED!
  $

This patchset is still not completely merged, so when adding the
PERF_SAMPLE_CODE_PAGE_SIZE to 'struct perf_sample' we need to add the
bits added in this patch for 'perf_sample.data_page_size'.
