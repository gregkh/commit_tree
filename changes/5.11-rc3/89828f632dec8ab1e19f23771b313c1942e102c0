bus: mhi: core: Fix error handling in mhi_register_controller()

There are a few problems with the error handling in this function.  They
mostly center around the alloc_ordered_workqueue() allocation.
1) If that allocation fails or if the kcalloc() prior to it fails then
it leads to a NULL dereference when we call
destroy_workqueue(mhi_cntrl->hiprio_wq).
2) The error code is not set.
3) The "mhi_cntrl->mhi_cmd" allocation is not freed.

The error handling was slightly confusing and I re-ordered it to be in
the exact mirror/reverse order of how things were allocated.  I changed
the label names to say what the goto does instead of describing where
the goto comes from.
