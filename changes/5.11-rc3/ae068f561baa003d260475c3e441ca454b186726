net: qrtr: Fix port ID for control messages

The port ID for control messages was uncorrectly set with broadcast
node ID value, causing message to be dropped on remote side since
not passing packet filtering (cb->dst_port != QRTR_PORT_CTRL).

Fixes: d27e77a3de28 ("net: qrtr: Reset the node and port ID of broadcast messages")
