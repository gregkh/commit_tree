i40e: Use batched xsk Tx interfaces to increase performance

Use the new batched xsk interfaces for the Tx path in the i40e driver
to improve performance. On my machine, this yields a throughput
increase of 4% for the l2fwd sample app in xdpsock. If we instead just
look at the Tx part, this patch set increases throughput with above
20% for Tx.

Note that I had to explicitly loop unroll the inner loop to get to
this performance level, by using a pragma. It is honored by both clang
and gcc and should be ignored by versions that do not support
it. Using the -funroll-loops compiler command line switch on the
source file resulted in a loop unrolling on a higher level that
lead to a performance decrease instead of an increase.
