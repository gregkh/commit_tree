watchdog: qcom_wdt: set WDOG_HW_RUNNING bit when appropriate

If the watchdog hardware is enabled/running during boot, e.g.
due to a boot loader configuring it, we must tell the
watchdog framework about this fact so that it can ping the
watchdog until userspace opens the device and takes over
control.

Do so using the WDOG_HW_RUNNING flag that exists for exactly
that use-case.
