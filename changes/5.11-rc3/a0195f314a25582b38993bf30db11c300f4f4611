x86/resctrl: Don't move a task to the same resource group

Shakeel Butt reported in [1] that a user can request a task to be moved
to a resource group even if the task is already in the group. It just
wastes time to do the move operation which could be costly to send IPI
to a different CPU.

Add a sanity check to ensure that the move operation only happens when
the task is not already in the resource group.
