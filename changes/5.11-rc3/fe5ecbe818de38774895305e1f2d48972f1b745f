btrfs: precalculate checksums per leaf once

btrfs_csum_bytes_to_leaves shows up in system profiles, which makes it a
candidate for optimizations. After the 64bit division has been replaced
by shift, there's still a calculation done each time the function is
called: checksums per leaf.

As this is a constant value for the entire filesystem lifetime, we
can calculate it once at mount time and reuse. This also allows to
reduce the division to 64bit/32bit as we know the constant will always
fit the 32bit type.

Replace the open-coded rounding up with a macro that internally handles
the 64bit division and as it's now a short function, make it static
inline (slight code increase, slight stack usage reduction).
