ovl: document lower modification caveats

Some overlayfs optional features are incompatible with offline changes to
the lower tree and may result in -EXDEV, -EIO, or other errors.  Such
modification is not supported and the error behavior is intentionally not
specified.

Update the "Changes to underlying filesystems" section to note this
restriction.  Move the paragraph describing the offline behavior below the
online behavior so it is adjacent to the following 3 paragraphs describing
the NFS export offline modification behavior.
