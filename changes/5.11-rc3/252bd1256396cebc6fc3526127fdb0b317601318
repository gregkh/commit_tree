dm verity: skip verity work if I/O error when system is shutting down

If emergency system shutdown is called, like by thermal shutdown,
a dm device could be alive when the block device couldn't process
I/O requests anymore. In this state, the handling of I/O errors
by new dm I/O requests or by those already in-flight can lead to
a verity corruption state, which is a misjudgment.

So, skip verity work in response to I/O error when system is shutting
down.
