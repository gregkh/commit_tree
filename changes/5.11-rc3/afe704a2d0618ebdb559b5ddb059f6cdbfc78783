thunderbolt: Add support for end-to-end flow control

USB4 spec defines end-to-end (E2E) flow control that can be used between
hosts to prevent overflow of a RX ring. We previously had this partially
implemented but that code was removed with commit 53f13319d131
("thunderbolt: Get rid of E2E workaround") with the idea that we add it
back properly if there ever is need. Now that we are going to add DMA
traffic test driver (in subsequent patches) this can be useful.

For this reason we modify tb_ring_alloc_rx/tx() so that they accept
RING_FLAG_E2E and configure the hardware ring accordingly. The RX side
also requires passing TX HopID (e2e_tx_hop) used in the credit grant
packets.
