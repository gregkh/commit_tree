ALSA: hda: Fix regressions on clear and reconfig sysfs

It seems that the HD-audio clear and reconfig sysfs don't work any
longer after the recent driver core change.  There are multiple issues
around that: the linked list corruption and the dead device handling.
The former issue is fixed by another patch for the driver core itself,
while the latter patch needs to be addressed in HD-audio side.

This patch corresponds to the latter, it recovers those broken
functions by replacing the device detach and attach actions with the
standard core API functions, which are almost equivalent with unbind
and bind actions.
