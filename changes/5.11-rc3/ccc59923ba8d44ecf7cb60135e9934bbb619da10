scsi: mpt3sas: Handling HBA vSES device

Each direct attached device will have a unique Port ID, but with an
exception. HBA vSES may use the same Port ID of another direct attached
device Port's ID. As a result, special handling is needed for vSES.

Create a virtual_phy object when a new HBA vSES device is detected and add
this virtual_phy object to vphys_list of port ID's hba_port object.  When
the HBA vSES device is removed then remove the corresponding virtual_phy
object from its parent's hba_port's vphy_list and free this virtual_vphy
object.

In hba_port object add vphy_mask field to hold the list of HBA phy bits
which are assigned to vSES devices. Also add vphy_list list to hold list of
virtual_phy objects which holds the same portID of current hba_port's
portID.

Also, add a hba_vphy field in _sas_phy object to determine whether this
_sas_phy object belongs to vSES device or not.

 - Allocate a virtual_phy object whenever a virtual phy is detected while
   processing the SASIOUnitPage0's phy data. And this allocated virtual_phy
   object to corresponding PortID's hba_port's vphy_list.

 - When a vSES device is added to the SML then initialize the corresponding
   virtual_phy objects's sas_address field with vSES device's SAS Address.

 - Free this virtual_phy object during driver unload time and when this
   vSES device is removed.
