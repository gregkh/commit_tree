mtd: spi-nor: core: perform a Soft Reset on shutdown

Perform a Soft Reset on shutdown on flashes that support it so that the
flash can be reset to its initial state and any configurations made by
spi-nor (given that they're only done in volatile registers) will be
reset. This will hand back the flash in pristine state for any further
operations on it.
