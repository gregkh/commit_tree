iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Read back stream mappings

The Qualcomm boot loader configures stream mapping for the peripherals
that it accesses and in particular it sets up the stream mapping for the
display controller to be allowed to scan out a splash screen or EFI
framebuffer.

Read back the stream mappings during initialization and make the
arm-smmu driver maintain the streams in bypass mode.
