tools build: Add missing libcap to test-all.bin target

We're missing -lcap in test-all.bin target, so in case it's the only
library missing (if more are missing test-all.bin fails anyway), we will
falsely claim that we detected it and fail build, like:

  $ make
  ...
  Auto-detecting system features:
  ...                         dwarf: [ on  ]
