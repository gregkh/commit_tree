mptcp: plug subflow context memory leak

When a MPTCP listener socket is closed with unaccepted
children pending, the ULP release callback will be invoked,
but nobody will call into __mptcp_close_ssk() on the
corresponding subflow.

As a consequence, at ULP release time, the 'disposable' flag
will be cleared and the subflow context memory will be leaked.

This change addresses the issue always freeing the context if
the subflow is still in the accept queue at ULP release time.

Additionally, this fixes an incorrect code reference in the
related comment.

Note: this fix leverages the changes introduced by the previous
commit.
