aoe: don't call set_capacity from irq context

Updating the block device size from irq context can lead to torn
writes of the 64-bit value, and prevents us from using normal
process context locking primitives to serialize access to the 64-bit
nr_sectors value.  Defer the set_capacity to the already existing
workqueue handler, where it can be merged with the update of the
block device size by using set_capacity_and_notify.  As an extra
bonus this also adds proper uevent notifications for the resize.
