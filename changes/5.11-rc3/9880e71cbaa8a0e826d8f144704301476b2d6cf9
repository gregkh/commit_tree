tools kvm headers: Update KVM headers from the kernel sources

To pick the changes from:

  8d14797b53f044fd ("KVM: arm64: Move 'struct kvm_arch_memory_slot' out of uapi/")

That don't causes any changes in tooling, only addresses this perf build
warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
