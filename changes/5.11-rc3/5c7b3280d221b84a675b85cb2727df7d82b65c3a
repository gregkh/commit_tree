rapidio: remove unused rio_get_asm() and rio_get_device()

The functions rio_get_asm() and rio_get_device() are globally exported
but have almost no users in tree. The only user is rio_init_mports()
which invokes it via rio_init().

rio_init() iterates over every registered device and invokes
rio_fixup_device().  It looks like a fixup function which should perform a
"change" to the device but does nothing.  It has been like this since its
introduction in commit 394b701ce4fbf ("[PATCH] RapidIO support: core
base") which was merged into v2.6.15-rc1.

Remove rio_init() because the performed fixup function
(rio_fixup_device()) does nothing.  Remove rio_get_asm() and
rio_get_device() which have no callers now.
