sched: Add migrate_disable()

Add the base migrate_disable() support (under protest).

While migrate_disable() is (currently) required for PREEMPT_RT, it is
also one of the biggest flaws in the system.

Notably this is just the base implementation, it is broken vs
sched_setaffinity() and hotplug, both solved in additional patches for
ease of review.
