net: hns3: add support for max 512 rss size

Currently, the driver gets the max rss size from configuration
file when initialization. Both the PF and VF share the same
max rss size, and no more than 128.

For DEVICE_VERSION_V3, the max rss size for PF can be up to
512, so there is a new field in configuration file to store it,
the old filed is used for VF.

To be compatible with boards using old configure file, the PF
will use the old filed if the one is zero.

For the rss size may be larger than 256, so the type of
rss_indirection_tbl of struct hclge_vport should be changed to
u16 as well.
