PM: EM: Add a flag indicating units of power values in Energy Model

There are different platforms and devices which might use different scale
for the power values. Kernel sub-systems might need to check if all
Energy Model (EM) devices are using the same scale. Address that issue and
store the information inside EM for each device. Thanks to that they can
be easily compared and proper action triggered.
