powerpc/signal: Don't manage floating point regs when no FPU

There is no point in copying floating point regs when there
is no FPU and MATH_EMULATION is not selected.

Create a new CONFIG_PPC_FPU_REGS bool that is selected by
CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION and CONFIG_PPC_FPU, and use it to
opt out everything related to fp_state in thread_struct.

The asm const used only by fpu.S are opted out with CONFIG_PPC_FPU
as fpu.S build is conditionnal to CONFIG_PPC_FPU.

The following app spends approx 8.1 seconds system time on an 8xx
without the patch, and 7.0 seconds with the patch (13.5% reduction).

On an 832x, it spends approx 2.6 seconds system time without
the patch and 2.1 seconds with the patch (19% reduction).

	void sigusr1(int sig) { }

	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		int i = 100000;

		signal(SIGUSR1, sigusr1);
		for (;i--;)
			raise(SIGUSR1);
		exit(0);
	}
