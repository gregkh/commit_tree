ASoC: AMD Renoir - add DMI table to avoid the ACP mic probe (broken BIOS)

Users reported that some Lenovo AMD platforms do not have ACP microphone,
but the BIOS advertises it via ACPI.

This patch create a simple DMI table, where those machines with the broken
BIOS can be added. The DMI description for Lenovo IdeaPad 5 and
IdeaPad Flex 5 devices are added there.

Also describe the dmic_acpi_check kernel module parameter in a more
understandable way.
