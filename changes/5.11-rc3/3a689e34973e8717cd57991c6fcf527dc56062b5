r8169: remove unneeded memory barrier in rtl_tx

tp->dirty_tx isn't changed outside rtl_tx(). Therefore I see no need
to guarantee a specific order of reading tp->dirty_tx and tp->cur_tx.
Having said that we can remove the memory barrier.
In addition use READ_ONCE() when reading tp->cur_tx because it can
change in parallel to rtl_tx().
