octeontx2-af: Fix return of uninitialized variable err

Currently the variable err may be uninitialized if several of the if
statements are not executed in function nix_tx_vtag_decfg and a garbage
value in err is returned.  Fix this by initialized ret at the start of
the function.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
