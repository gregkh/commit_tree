usb: typec: tcpm: Clear send_discover in tcpm_check_send_discover

tcpm_check_send_discover does not clear the send_discover flag
when any of the following conditions are not met.
1. data_role is TYPEC_HOST
2. link is pd_capable

Discovery indentity would anyways not be attempted during
the current session anymore when the above conditions are not
met. Hence clear the send_discover flag here to prevent
tcpm_enable_frs_work from rescheduling indefinetly.
