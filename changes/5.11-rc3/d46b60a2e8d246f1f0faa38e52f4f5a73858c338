drm/i915: Mark ininitial fb obj as WT on eLLC machines to avoid rcu lockup during fbdev init

Currently we leave the cache_level of the initial fb obj
set to NONE. This means on eLLC machines the first pin_to_display()
will try to switch it to WT which requires a vma unbind+bind.
If that happens during the fbdev initialization rcu does not
seem operational which causes the unbind to get stuck. To
most appearances this looks like a dead machine on boot.

Avoid the unbind by already marking the object cache_level
as WT when creating it. We still do an excplicit ggtt pin
which will rewrite the PTEs anyway, so they will match whatever
cache level we set.
