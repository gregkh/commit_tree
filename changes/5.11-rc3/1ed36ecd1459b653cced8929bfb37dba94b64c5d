media: i2c: imx219: Selection compliance fixes

To comply with the intended usage of the V4L2 selection target when
used to retrieve a sensor image properties, adjust the rectangles
returned by the imx219 driver.

The top/left crop coordinates of the TGT_CROP rectangle were set to
(0, 0) instead of (8, 8) which is the offset from the larger physical
pixel array rectangle. This was also a mismatch with the default values
crop rectangle value, so this is corrected. Found with v4l2-compliance.

While at it, add V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_BOUNDS support: CROP_DEFAULT and
CROP_BOUNDS have the same size as the non-active pixels are not readable
using the selection API. Found with v4l2-compliance.

[reword commit message, use macros for pixel offsets]
