net/mlx5e: ethtool, Fix restriction of autoneg with 56G

Prior to this patch, configuring speed to 50G with autoneg off over
devices supporting 50G per lane failed.
Support for 50G per lane introduced a new set of link-modes, on which
driver always performed a speed validation as if only legacy link-modes
were configured. Fix driver speed validation to force setting autoneg
over 56G only if in legacy link-mode.
