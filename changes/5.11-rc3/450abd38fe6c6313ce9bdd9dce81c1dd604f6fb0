ARM: kernel: use relative references for UP/SMP alternatives

Currently, the .alt.smp.init section contains the virtual addresses
of the patch sites. Since patching may occur both before and after
switching into virtual mode, this requires some manual handling of
the address when applying the UP alternative.

Let's simplify this by using relative offsets in the table entries:
this allows us to simply add each entry's address to its contents,
regardless of whether we are running in virtual mode or not.
