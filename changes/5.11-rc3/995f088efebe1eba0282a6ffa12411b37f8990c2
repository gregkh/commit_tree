perf/core: Add support for PERF_SAMPLE_CODE_PAGE_SIZE

When studying code layout, it is useful to capture the page size of the
sampled code address.

Add a new sample type for code page size.
The new sample type requires collecting the ip. The code page size can
be calculated from the NMI-safe perf_get_page_size().

For large PEBS, it's very unlikely that the mapping is gone for the
earlier PEBS records. Enable the feature for the large PEBS. The worst
case is that page-size '0' is returned.
