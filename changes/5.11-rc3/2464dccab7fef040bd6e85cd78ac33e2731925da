ASoC: sun8i-codec: Require an exact BCLK divisor match

Now that we guarantee that SYSCLK is running at the optimal rate when
hw_params succeeds, and that it will continue running at that rate,
SYSCLK will always be an integer multiple of BCLK. So we can always
pick the exact divider, not just the closest divider.
