iio: adc: at91_adc: rework resolution selection

Move the possible resolution values back to the driver. This removes the
atmel,adc-res and atmel,adc-res-names properties, leaving only
atmel,adc-use-res. As atmel,adc-res-names had to contain "lowres" and
"highres", those where already the only allowed values for
atmel,adc-use-res.

Also introduce a new compatible string for the sama5d3 as this is the only
one with a different resolution. Also it doesn't even have the LOWRES
bit.
