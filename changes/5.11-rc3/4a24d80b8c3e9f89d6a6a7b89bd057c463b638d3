x86/mce, cper: Pass x86 CPER through the MCA handling chain

The kernel uses ACPI Boot Error Record Table (BERT) to report fatal
errors that occurred in a previous boot. The MCA errors in the BERT are
reported using the x86 Processor Error Common Platform Error Record
(CPER) format. Currently, the record prints out the raw MSR values and
AMD relies on the raw record to provide MCA information.

Extract the raw MSR values of MCA registers from the BERT and feed them
into mce_log() to decode them properly.

The implementation is SMCA-specific as the raw MCA register values are
given in the register offset order of the SMCA address space.
