net: evaluate net.ipv4.conf.all.proxy_arp_pvlan

Introduced in 65324144b50b, the "proxy_arp_vlan" sysctl is a
per-interface sysctl to tune proxy ARP support for private VLANs.
While the "all" variant is exposed, it was a noop and never evaluated.
We use the usual "or" logic for this kind of sysctls.
