btrfs: add assertion for empty list of transactions at late stage of umount

Add an assertion to close_ctree(), after destroying all the work queues,
to verify we do not have any transaction still open or committing at that
at that point. If we have any, it means something is seriously wrong and
that can cause memory leaks and use-after-free problems. This is motivated
by the previous patches that fixed bugs where we ended up leaking an open
transaction after unmounting the filesystem.
