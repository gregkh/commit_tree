net: hns3: remove unsupported NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL_CSUM

Currently, device V1 and V2 do not support segmentation
offload for UDP based tunnel packet who needs outer UDP
checksum offload, so there is a workaround in the driver
to set the checksum of the outer UDP checksum as zero. This
is not what the user wants, so remove this feature for
device V1 and V2, add support for it later(when the device
has the ability to do that).
