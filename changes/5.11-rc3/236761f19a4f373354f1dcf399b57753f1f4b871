thermal/drivers/cpufreq_cooling: Update cpufreq_state only if state has changed

If state has not changed successfully and we updated cpufreq_state,
next time when the new state is equal to cpufreq_state (not changed
successfully last time), we will return directly and miss a
freq_qos_update_request() that should have been.
