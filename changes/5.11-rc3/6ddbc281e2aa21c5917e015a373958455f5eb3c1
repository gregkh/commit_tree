KVM: arm64: Move kvm_vcpu_trap_il_is32bit into kvm_skip_instr32()

There is no need to feed the result of kvm_vcpu_trap_il_is32bit()
to kvm_skip_instr(), as only AArch32 has a variable length ISA, and
this helper can equally be called from kvm_skip_instr32(), reducing
the complexity at all the call sites.
