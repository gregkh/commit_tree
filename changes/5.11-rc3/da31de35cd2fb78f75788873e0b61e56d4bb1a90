tty: goldfish: use __raw_writel()/__raw_readl()

gf_early_console_putchar() uses __raw_writel() but the standard driver
uses writel()/readl(). This means we can't use both on the same machine
as the device is either big-endian, little-endian or native-endian.

As android implementation defines the endianness of the device is the one
of the architecture replace all writel()/readl() by
__raw_writel()/__raw_readl()
