scsi: lpfc: Remove ndlp when a PLOGI/ADISC/PRLI/REG_RPI ultimately fails

When a PLOGI/ADISC/PRLI/REG_RPI fails, the node remains in the nodelist in
that state.  Although the driver now frees a node when the ref count goes
to zero, in this case the ref cnt doesn't reach zero because there isn't a
mechanism to release the final reference.  Discovery just stops.

Fix by calling the node discovery state machine DEVICE_RM event whenever
one of these commands fail. This will remove the final reference count and
trigger node release.
