powerpc/32s: Split and inline flush_range()

flush_range() handle both the MMU_FTR_HPTE_TABLE case and
the other case.

The non MMU_FTR_HPTE_TABLE case is trivial as it is only a call
to _tlbie()/_tlbia() which is not worth a dedicated function.

Make flush_range() a hash specific and call it from tlbflush.h based
on mmu_has_feature(MMU_FTR_HPTE_TABLE).
