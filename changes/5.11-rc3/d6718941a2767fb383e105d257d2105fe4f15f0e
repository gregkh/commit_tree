powerpc/powernv/memtrace: Fix crashing the kernel when enabling concurrently

It's very easy to crash the kernel right now by simply trying to
enable memtrace concurrently, hammering on the "enable" interface

loop.sh:
  #!/bin/bash

  dmesg --console-off

  while true; do
          echo 0x40000000 > /sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/memtrace/enable
  done

[root@localhost ~]# loop.sh &
[root@localhost ~]# loop.sh &

Resulting quickly in a kernel crash. Let's properly protect using a
mutex.
