net: hdlc_fr: Do skb_reset_mac_header for skbs received on normal PVC devices

When an skb is received on a normal (non-Ethernet-emulating) PVC device,
call skb_reset_mac_header before we pass it to upper layers.

This is because normal PVC devices don't have header_ops, so any header we
have would not be visible to upper layer code when sending, so the header
shouldn't be visible to upper layer code when receiving, either.
