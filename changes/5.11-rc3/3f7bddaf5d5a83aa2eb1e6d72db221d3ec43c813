device property: add description of fwnode cases

There are only four valid fwnode cases which are
- primary --> secondary --> -ENODEV
- primary --> NULL
- secondary --> -ENODEV
- NULL

dev->fwnode should be converted between the 4 cases above no matter
how/when set_primary_fwnode() and set_secondary_fwnode() are called.
Describe it in the code so people will keep it in mind.
