MAINTAINERS: Cleanup SGI-related entries

UV platforms are the only ones which currently use the XP/XPC/XPNET
driver, so it seems fair HPE should take some responsibility as
maintainers of it; so add Mike Travis and Steve Wahl. Cliff Whickman's
email address is no longer valid, so remove it. Robin Holt was contacted
and wishes to remain as a maintainer.

Update Dimitri Sivanich's email address for the SGI GRU driver.

Add Mike Travis to HPE Superdome Flex (UV) platform.
