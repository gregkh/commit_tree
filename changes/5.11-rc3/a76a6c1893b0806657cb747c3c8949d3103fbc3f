HID: sony: Report more accurate DS4 power status.

This patch moves the power supply status logic to DS3/DS4 parse_report,
to allow for more accurate DS4 status reporting.

The DS4 power status code was actually incorrect, but reported okay'ish
data in most cases. There was a different interpretation of the battery_info
values 0-10 or 0-9 depending on cable state. It added +1 to extend the range
to 0-10. This is actually incorrect, there is no different range. Values
higher than 11 actually indicates 'full' and 14/15 'error' for which we
reported 100% and a valid power state.

Moving the status logic to parse_report avoids having to pass more state
to the generic sony_battery_get_property and simplifies the code.
