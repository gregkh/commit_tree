Input: edt-ft5x06 - consolidate handling of number of electrodes

Instead of special-casing retrieval of number of X/Y electrodes based on
the firmware, let's select default values and mark registers as
non-existent on firmwares that do not support this operation.

Also mark "report rate" register as non-existent for generic firmwares
as having it set to 0 does not make sense.
