tools arch x86: Sync the msr-index.h copy with the kernel sources

To pick up the changes in:

Fixes: 69372cf01290b958 ("x86/cpu: Add VM page flush MSR availablility as a CPUID feature")

That cause these changes in tooling:

The new MSR has a pattern that wasn't matched to avoid a clash with
IA32_UCODE_REV, change the regex to prefer the more relevant AMD_
prefixed ones to catch this new AMD64_VM_PAGE_FLUSH MSR.

Which causes these parts of tools/perf/ to be rebuilt:

  CC       /tmp/build/perf/trace/beauty/tracepoints/x86_msr.o
  LD       /tmp/build/perf/trace/beauty/tracepoints/perf-in.o
  LD       /tmp/build/perf/trace/beauty/perf-in.o
  LD       /tmp/build/perf/perf-in.o
  LINK     /tmp/build/perf/perf

This addresses this perf tools build warning:

  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h
  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h'
