bnxt_en: Check TQM rings for maximum supported value.

TQM rings are hardware resources that require host context memory
managed by the driver.  The driver supports up to 9 TQM rings and
the number of rings to use is requested by firmware during run-time.
Cap this number to the maximum supported to prevent accessing beyond
the array.  Future firmware may request more than 9 TQM rings.  Define
macros to remove the magic number 9 from the C code.

Fixes: ac3158cb0108 ("bnxt_en: Allocate TQM ring context memory according to fw specification.")
