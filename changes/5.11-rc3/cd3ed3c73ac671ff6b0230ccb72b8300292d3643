jffs2: Allow setting rp_size to zero during remounting

Set rp_size to zero will be ignore during remounting.

The method to identify whether we input a remounting option of
rp_size is to check if the rp_size input is zero. It can not work
well if we pass "rp_size=0".

This patch add a bool variable "set_rp_size" to fix this problem.
