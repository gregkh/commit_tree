um: ubd: Set device serial attribute from cmdline

Adds the ability to set the UBD device serial number from the
commandline, disabling the serial number functionality by default.

In some cases it may be useful to set a serial to the UBD device, such
that downstream users (i.e. udev) can use this information to better
describe the hardware to the user from the UML cmdline. In our case we
use this parameter to create some entries under /dev/disk/by-ubd-id/
for each of the UBD devices passed through the UML cmdline.
