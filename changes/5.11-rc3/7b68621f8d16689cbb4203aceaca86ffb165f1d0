ftrace: Clean up the recursion code a bit

In trace_test_and_set_recursion(), current->trace_recursion is placed into a
variable, and that variable should be used for the processing, as there's no
reason to dereference current multiple times.

On trace_clear_recursion(), current->trace_recursion is modified and there's
no reason to copy it over to a variable.
