batman-adv: Prepare infrastructure for newlink settings

The batadv generic netlink family can be used to retrieve the current state
and set various configuration settings. But there are also settings which
must be set before the actual interface is created.

The rtnetlink already uses IFLA_INFO_DATA to allow net_device families to
transfer such configurations. The minimal required functionality for this
is now available for the batadv rtnl_link_ops. Also a new IFLA class of
attributes will be attached to it because rtnetlink only allows 51
different attributes but batadv_nl_attrs already contains 62 attributes.
