KVM: SVM: Remove the call to sev_platform_status() during setup

When both KVM support and the CCP driver are built into the kernel instead
of as modules, KVM initialization can happen before CCP initialization. As
a result, sev_platform_status() will return a failure when it is called
from sev_hardware_setup(), when this isn't really an error condition.

Since sev_platform_status() doesn't need to be called at this time anyway,
remove the invocation from sev_hardware_setup().
