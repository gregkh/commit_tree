kvm/eventfd: Use priority waitqueue to catch events before userspace

As far as I can tell, when we use posted interrupts we silently cut off
the events from userspace, if it's listening on the same eventfd that
feeds the irqfd.

I like that behaviour. Let's do it all the time, even without posted
interrupts. It makes it much easier to handle IRQ remapping invalidation
without having to constantly add/remove the fd from the userspace poll
set. We can just leave userspace polling on it, and the bypass will...
well... bypass it.
