ALSA: usb-audio: Drop unneeded snd_usb_substream fields

Some fields like interface and alt_idx in snd_usb_substream are mostly
useless now as they can be referred via either cur_audiofmt or
data_endpoint assigned to the substream.  Drop those, and also assure
the concurrency about the access of cur_audiofmt field.
