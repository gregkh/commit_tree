irqchip/ocelot: Add support for Luton platforms

This patch extends irqchip driver for oceleot to be used with an other
vcoreiii base platform: Luton.

For this platform there is a few differences:
   - the interrupt must be enabled for the parent controller
   - there is no trigger register needed to be managed
