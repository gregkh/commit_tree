ceph: implement updated ceph_mds_request_head structure

When we added the btime feature in mainline ceph, we had to extend
struct ceph_mds_request_args so that it could be set. Implement the same
in the kernel client.

Rename ceph_mds_request_head with a _old extension, and a union
ceph_mds_request_args_ext to allow for the extended size of the new
header format.

Add the appropriate code to handle both formats in struct
create_request_message and key the behavior on whether the peer supports
CEPH_FEATURE_FS_BTIME.

The gid_list field in the payload is now populated from the saved
credential. For now, we don't add any support for setting the btime via
setattr, but this does enable us to add that in the future.
