mtd: spi-nor: Introduce SNOR_F_IO_MODE_EN_VOLATILE

We don't want to enter a stateful mode, where a X-X-X I/O mode
is entered by setting a non-volatile bit, because in case of a
reset or a crash, once in the non-volatile mode, we may not be able
to recover in bootloaders and we may break the SPI NOR boot.

Forbid by default the I/O modes that are set via a non-volatile bit.

SPI_NOR_IO_MODE_EN_VOLATILE should be set just for the flashes that
don't define the optional SFDP SCCR Map, so that we don't pollute the
flash info flags.
