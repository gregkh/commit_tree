net: forcedeth: Replace context and lock check with a lockdep_assert()

nv_update_stats() triggers a WARN_ON() when invoked from hard interrupt
context because the locks in use are not hard interrupt safe. It also has
an assert_spin_locked() which was the lock check before the lockdep era.

Lockdep has way broader locking correctness checks and covers both issues,
so replace the warning and the lock assert with lockdep_assert_held().
