powerpc/ptrace: Simplify gpr_get()/tm_cgpr_get()

gpr_get() does membuf_write() twice to override pt_regs->msr in
between. We can call membuf_write() once and change ->msr in the
kernel buffer, this simplifies the code and the next fix.

The patch adds a new simple helper, membuf_at(offs), it returns the
new membuf which can be safely used after membuf_write().
