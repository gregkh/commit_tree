scsi: mpt3sas: Add persistent Master trigger page

Trigger Page 1 is used to store information about Master triggers.  Below
are the Master trigger conditions:

  Bit[3]  Trigger condition for Device Removal event
  Bit[2]  Trigger condition for TM command issued by driver
  Bit[1]  Trigger condition for Adapter reset issued by driver
  Bit[0]  Trigger condition for IOC Fault state

During driver load, if Master trigger type bit is enabled in the Persistent
Trigger Page0, then read the Persistent Trigger Page1 and update the IOC
instance's diag_trigger_master.MasterData with Persistent Trigger Page1's
MasterTriggerFlags.
