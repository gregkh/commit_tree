samples: bpf: Refactor task_fd_query program with libbpf

This commit refactors the existing kprobe program with libbpf bpf
loader. To attach bpf program, this uses generic bpf_program__attach()
approach rather than using bpf_load's load_bpf_file().

To attach bpf to perf_event, instead of using previous ioctl method,
this commit uses bpf_program__attach_perf_event since it manages the
enable of perf_event and attach of BPF programs to it, which is much
more intuitive way to achieve.

Also, explicit close(fd) has been removed since event will be closed
inside bpf_link__destroy() automatically.

Furthermore, to prevent conflict of same named uprobe events, O_TRUNC
flag has been used to clear 'uprobe_events' interface.
