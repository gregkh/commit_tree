drm/amdgpu/sdma5.2: soft reset sdma blocks before setup and start sdma

Without doing the soft reset, register mmSDMA0_GFX_RB_WPTR's value could not be
reset to 0 when sdma block resumes. That would cause the ring buffer's read and
write pointers not equal and ring test fail. So add the soft reset step.
