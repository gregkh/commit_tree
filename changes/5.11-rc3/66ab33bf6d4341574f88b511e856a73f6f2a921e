virtiofs fix leak in setup

This can be triggered for example by adding the "-omand" mount option,
which will be rejected and virtio_fs_fill_super() will return an error.

In such a case the allocations for fuse_conn and fuse_mount will leak due
to s_root not yet being set and so ->put_super() not being called.
