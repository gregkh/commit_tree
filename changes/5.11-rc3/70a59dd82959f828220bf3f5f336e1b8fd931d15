drm/<drivers>: Constify struct drm_driver

Only the following drivers aren't converted:
- amdgpu, because of the driver_feature mangling due to virt support.
  Subsequent patch will address this.
- nouveau, because DRIVER_ATOMIC uapi is still not the default on the
  platforms where it's supported (i.e. again driver_feature mangling)
- vc4, again because of driver_feature mangling
- qxl, because the ioctl table is somewhere else and moving that is
  maybe a bit too much, hence the num_ioctls assignment prevents a
  const driver structure.
- arcpgu, because that is stuck behind a pending tiny-fication series
  from me.
- legacy drivers, because legacy requires non-const drm_driver.

Note that for armada I also went ahead and made the ioctl array const.

Only cc'ing the driver people who've not been converted (everyone else
is way too much).

v2: Fix one misplaced const static, should be static const (0day)

v3:
- Improve commit message (Sam)
