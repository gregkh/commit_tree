bpf: Lift hashtab key_size limit

Currently key_size of hashtab is limited to MAX_BPF_STACK.
As the key of hashtab can also be a value from a per cpu map it can be
larger than MAX_BPF_STACK.

The use-case for this patch originates to implement allow/disallow
lists for files and file paths. The maximum length of file paths is
defined by PATH_MAX with 4096 chars including nul.
This limit exceeds MAX_BPF_STACK.

Changelog:

v5:
 - Fix cast overflow

v4:

v3:
