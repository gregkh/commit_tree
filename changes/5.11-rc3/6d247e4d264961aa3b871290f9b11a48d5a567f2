powerpc/ps3: make system bus's remove and shutdown callbacks return void

The driver core ignores the return value of struct device_driver::remove
because there is only little that can be done. For the shutdown callback
it's ps3_system_bus_shutdown() which ignores the return value.

To simplify the quest to make struct device_driver::remove return void,
let struct ps3_system_bus_driver::remove return void, too. All users
already unconditionally return 0, this commit makes it obvious that
returning an error code is a bad idea and ensures future users behave
accordingly.
