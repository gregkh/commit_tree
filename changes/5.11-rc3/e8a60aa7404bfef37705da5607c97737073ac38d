platform/x86: Introduce support for Systems Management Driver over WMI for Dell Systems

The Dell WMI Systems Management Driver provides a sysfs
interface for systems management to enable BIOS configuration
capability on certain Dell Systems.

This driver allows user to configure Dell systems with a
uniform common interface. To facilitate this, the patch
introduces a generic way for driver to be able to create
configurable BIOS Attributes available in Setup (F2) screen.
