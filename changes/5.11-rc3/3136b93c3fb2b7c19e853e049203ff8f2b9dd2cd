entry: Expose helpers to migrate TIF to SYSCALL_WORK flags

With the goal to split the syscall work related flags into a separate
field that is architecture independent, expose transitional helpers that
resolve to either the TIF flags or to the corresponding SYSCALL_WORK
flags.  This will allow architectures to migrate only when they port to
the generic syscall entry code.
