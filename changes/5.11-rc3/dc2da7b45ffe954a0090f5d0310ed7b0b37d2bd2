mm: memmap defer init doesn't work as expected

VMware observed a performance regression during memmap init on their
platform, and bisected to commit 73a6e474cb376 ("mm: memmap_init:
iterate over memblock regions rather that check each PFN") causing it.

Before the commit:

  [0.033176] Normal zone: 1445888 pages used for memmap
  [0.033176] Normal zone: 89391104 pages, LIFO batch:63
  [0.035851] ACPI: PM-Timer IO Port: 0x448

With commit

  [0.026874] Normal zone: 1445888 pages used for memmap
  [0.026875] Normal zone: 89391104 pages, LIFO batch:63
  [2.028450] ACPI: PM-Timer IO Port: 0x448

The root cause is the current memmap defer init doesn't work as expected.

Before, memmap_init_zone() was used to do memmap init of one whole zone,
to initialize all low zones of one numa node, but defer memmap init of
the last zone in that numa node.  However, since commit 73a6e474cb376,
function memmap_init() is adapted to iterater over memblock regions
inside one zone, then call memmap_init_zone() to do memmap init for each
region.

E.g, on VMware's system, the memory layout is as below, there are two
memory regions in node 2.  The current code will mistakenly initialize the
whole 1st region [mem 0xab00000000-0xfcffffffff], then do memmap defer to
iniatialize only one memmory section on the 2nd region [mem
0x10000000000-0x1033fffffff].  In fact, we only expect to see that there's
only one memory section's memmap initialized.  That's why more time is
costed at the time.

[    0.008842] ACPI: SRAT: Node 0 PXM 0 [mem 0x00000000-0x0009ffff]
[    0.008842] ACPI: SRAT: Node 0 PXM 0 [mem 0x00100000-0xbfffffff]
[    0.008843] ACPI: SRAT: Node 0 PXM 0 [mem 0x100000000-0x55ffffffff]
[    0.008844] ACPI: SRAT: Node 1 PXM 1 [mem 0x5600000000-0xaaffffffff]
[    0.008844] ACPI: SRAT: Node 2 PXM 2 [mem 0xab00000000-0xfcffffffff]
[    0.008845] ACPI: SRAT: Node 2 PXM 2 [mem 0x10000000000-0x1033fffffff]

Now, let's add a parameter 'zone_end_pfn' to memmap_init_zone() to pass
down the real zone end pfn so that defer_init() can use it to judge
whether defer need be taken in zone wide.
