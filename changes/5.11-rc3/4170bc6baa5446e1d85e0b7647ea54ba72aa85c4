bpf: Exercise syscall operations for inode and sk storage

Use the check_syscall_operations added for task_local_storage to
exercise syscall operations for other local storage maps:

* Check the absence of an element for the given fd.
* Create a new element, retrieve and compare its value.
* Delete the element and check again for absence.
