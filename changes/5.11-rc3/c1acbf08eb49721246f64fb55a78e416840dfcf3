drm/client: Depend on GEM object kmap ref-counting

DRM client's vmap/vunmap functions don't allow for multiple vmap
operations. Calling drm_client_buffer_vmap() twice returns the same
mapping, then calling drm_client_buffer_vunmap() twice already unmaps
on the first call. This leads to unbalanced vmap refcounts. Fix this
by calling drm_gem_vmap() unconditionally in drm_client_buffer_vmap().

All drivers that support DRM clients have to implement correct ref-
counting for their vmap operations, or not vunmap at all. This is the
case for drivers that use CMA, SHMEM and VRAM helpers, and QXL. Other
drivers are not affected.
