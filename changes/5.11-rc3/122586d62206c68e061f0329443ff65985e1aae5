phy: amlogic: phy-meson-gxl-usb2: keep ID pull-up even in Host mode

In order to keep OTG ID detection even when in Host mode, the ID line of
the PHY (if the current phy is an OTG one) pull-up should be kept
enable in both modes.

This fixes OTG switch on GXL, GXM & AXG platforms, otherwise once switched
to Host, the ID detection doesn't work anymore to switch back to Device.
