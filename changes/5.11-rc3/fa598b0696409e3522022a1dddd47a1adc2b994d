btrfs: remove recalc_thresholds from free space ops

After removing the inode number cache that was using the free space
cache code, we can remove at least the recalc_thresholds callback from
the ops. Both code and tests use the same callback function. It's moved
before its first use.

The use_bitmaps callback is still needed by tests to create some
extents/bitmap setup.
