drivers: net: smc911x: Fix passing wrong number of parameters to DBG() macro

Now that the compiler always sees the parameters passed to the DBG()
macro, it gives an error message about wrong parameters. The comment
says it all:

	/* ndev is not valid yet, so avoid passing it in. */
	DBG(SMC_DEBUG_FUNC, "--> %s\n",  __func__);

You cannot not just pass a parameter!

The DBG does not seem to have any real value, to just remove it.
