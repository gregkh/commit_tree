pinctrl: Remove hole in pinctrl_gpio_range

On 64-bit platforms, pointer size and alignment are 64-bit, hence two
4-byte holes are present before the pins and gc members of the
pinctrl_gpio_range structure.  Get rid of these holes by moving the
pins pointer.

This reduces kernel size of an arm64 Rockchip kernel by ca. 512 bytes.
