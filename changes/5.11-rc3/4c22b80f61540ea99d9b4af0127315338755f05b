ASoC: pcm: DRAIN support reactivation

soc-pcm's dpcm_fe_dai_do_trigger() supported DRAIN commnad up to kernel
v5.4 where explicit switch(cmd) has been introduced which takes into
account all SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_xxx but SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_DRAIN. Update
switch statement to reactive support for it.

As DRAIN is somewhat unique by lacking negative/stop counterpart, bring
behaviour of dpcm_fe_dai_do_trigger() for said command back to its
pre-v5.4 state by adding it to START/RESUME/PAUSE_RELEASE group.
