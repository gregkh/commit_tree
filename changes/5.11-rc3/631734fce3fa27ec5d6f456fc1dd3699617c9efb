ACPI: EC: Untangle error handling in advance_transaction()

Introduce acpi_ec_spurious_interrupt() for recording spurious
interrupts and use it for error handling in advance_transaction(),
drop the (now redundant) original error handling block from there
along with a frew goto statements that are not necessary any more.

No intentional functional impact.
