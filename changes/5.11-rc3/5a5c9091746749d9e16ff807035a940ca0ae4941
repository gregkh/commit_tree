net: hns3: add support for tc mqprio offload

Currently, the HNS3 driver only supports offload for tc number
and prio_tc. This patch adds support for other qopts, including
queues count and offset for each tc.

When enable tc mqprio offload, it's not allowed to change
queue numbers by ethtool. For hardware limitation, the queue
number of each tc should be power of 2.

For the queues is not assigned to each tc by average, so it's
should return vport->alloc_tqps for hclge_get_max_channels().
