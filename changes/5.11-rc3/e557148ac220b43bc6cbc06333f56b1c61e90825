ASoC: sun8i-codec: Enforce symmetric DAI parameters

The AIFs have a single register controlling DAI parameters in both
directions, including BCLK/LRCK divisor and word size. The DAIs produce
only noise or silence if any of these parameters is wrong. Therefore, we
need to enforce symmetry for these parameters, so starting a new
substream will not break an existing substream.
