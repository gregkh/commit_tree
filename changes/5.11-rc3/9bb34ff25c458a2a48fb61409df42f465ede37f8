drm/i915/gt: Clear the buffer pool age before use

If we create a new node, it is possible for the slab allocator to return
us a recently freed node. If that node was just retired, it will retain
the current jiffy as its node->age. There is then a miniscule window,
where as that node is retired, it will appear on the free list with an
incorrect age and be eligible for reuse by one thread, and then by a
second thread as the correct node->age is written.
