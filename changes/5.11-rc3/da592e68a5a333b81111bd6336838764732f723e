KVM: arm64: Re-jig logic when patching hardened hyp vectors

The hardened hyp vectors are not used on systems running with VHE or CPUs
without the ARM64_HARDEN_EL2_VECTORS capability.

Re-jig the checking logic slightly in kvm_patch_vector_branch() so that
it's a bit clearer what we're looking for. This is purely cosmetic.
