zram: support page writeback

There is demand to writeback specific process pages to backing store
instead of all idles pages in the system due to storage wear out concerns
and to launching latency of apps which are most of the time idle but are
critical for resume latency.

This patch extends the writeback knob to support a specific page
writeback.
