ide: switch to __register_blkdev for command set probing

ide is the last user of the blk_register_region framework except for the
tracking of allocated gendisk.  Switch to __register_blkdev, even if that
doesn't allow us to trivially find out which command set to probe for.
That means we now always request all modules when a user tries to access
an unclaimed ide device node, but except for a few potentially loaded
modules for a fringe use case of a deprecated and soon to be removed
driver that doesn't make a difference.
