timekeeping: Remove static functions from kernel-doc markup

Various static functions in the timekeeping code have function comments
which pretend to be kernel-doc, but are incomplete and trigger parser
warnings.

As these functions are local to the timekeeping core code there is no need
to expose them via kernel-doc.

Remove the double star kernel-doc marker and remove excess newlines.
