scsi: lpfc: Remove dead code on second !ndlp check

Currently there is a null check on the pointer ndlp that exits via error
path issue_ct_rsp_exit followed by another null check on the same pointer
that is almost identical to the previous null check stanza and yet can
never can be reached because the previous check exited via
issue_ct_rsp_exit. This is deadcode and can be removed.
