KVM: arm64: Make BP hardening globals static instead

Branch predictor hardening of the hyp vectors is partially driven by a
couple of global variables ('__kvm_bp_vect_base' and
'__kvm_harden_el2_vector_slot'). However, these are only used within a
single compilation unit, so internalise them there instead.
