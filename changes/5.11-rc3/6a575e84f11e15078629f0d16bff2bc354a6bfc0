PM / devfreq: tegra30: Separate configurations per-SoC generation

Previously we were using count-weight of the T124 for T30 in order to
get EMC clock rate that was reasonable for T30. In fact the count-weight
should be x2 times smaller on T30, but then devfreq was producing a bit
too low EMC clock rate for ISO memory clients, like display controller
for example.

Now both Tegra ACTMON and Tegra DRM display drivers support interconnect
framework and display driver tells to ICC what a minimum memory bandwidth
is needed, preventing FIFO underflows. Thus, now we can use a proper
count-weight value for Tegra30 and MC_ALL device config needs a bit more
aggressive boosting.

Add a separate ACTMON driver configuration that is specific to Tegra30.
