virtio-mem: Big Block Mode (BBM) memory hotplug

Currently, we do not support device block sizes that exceed the Linux
memory block size. For example, having a device block size of 1 GiB (e.g.,
gigantic pages in the hypervisor) won't work with 128 MiB Linux memory
blocks.

Let's implement Big Block Mode (BBM), whereby we add/remove at least
one Linux memory block at a time. With a 1 GiB device block size, a Big
Block (BB) will cover 8 Linux memory blocks.

We'll keep registering the online_page_callback machinery, it will be used
for safe memory hotunplug in BBM next.

Note: BBM is properly prepared for variable-sized Linux memory
blocks that we might see in the future. So we won't care how many Linux
memory blocks a big block actually spans, and how the memory notifier is
called.
