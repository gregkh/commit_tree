mptcp: put reference in mptcp timeout timer

On close this timer might be scheduled. mptcp uses sk_reset_timer for
this, so the a reference on the mptcp socket is taken.

This causes a refcount leak which can for example be reproduced
with 'mp_join_server_v4.pkt' from the mptcp-packetdrill repo.

The leak has nothing to do with join requests, v1_mp_capable_bind_no_cs.pkt
works too when replacing the last ack mpcapable to v1 instead of v0.

unreferenced object 0xffff888109bba040 (size 2744):
