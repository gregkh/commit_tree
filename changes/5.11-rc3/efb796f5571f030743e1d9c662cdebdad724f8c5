ethtool: fix string set id check

Syzbot reported a shift of a u32 by more than 31 in strset_parse_request()
which is undefined behavior. This is caused by range check of string set id
using variable ret (which is always 0 at this point) instead of id (string
set id from request).

Fixes: 71921690f974 ("ethtool: provide string sets with STRSET_GET request")
