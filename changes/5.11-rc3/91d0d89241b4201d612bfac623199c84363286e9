ext4: don't call fscrypt_get_encryption_info() from dx_show_leaf()

The call to fscrypt_get_encryption_info() in dx_show_leaf() is too low
in the call tree; fscrypt_get_encryption_info() should have already been
called when starting the directory operation.  And indeed, it already
is.  Moreover, the encryption key is guaranteed to already be available
because dx_show_leaf() is only called when adding a new directory entry.

And even if the key wasn't available, dx_show_leaf() uses
fscrypt_fname_disk_to_usr() which knows how to create a no-key name.

So for the above reasons, and because it would be desirable to stop
exporting fscrypt_get_encryption_info() directly to filesystems, remove
the call to fscrypt_get_encryption_info() from dx_show_leaf().
