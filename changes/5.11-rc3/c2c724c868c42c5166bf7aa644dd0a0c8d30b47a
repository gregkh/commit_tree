driver core: Add fw_devlink_parse_fwtree()

This function is a wrapper around fwnode_operations.add_links().

This function parses each node in a fwnode tree and create fwnode links
for each of those nodes. The information for creating the fwnode links
(the supplier and consumer fwnode) is obtained by parsing the properties
in each of the fwnodes.

This function also ensures that no fwnode is parsed more than once by
marking the fwnodes as parsed.
