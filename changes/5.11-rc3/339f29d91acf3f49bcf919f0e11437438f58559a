checkpatch: update __attribute__((section("name"))) quote removal

commit 33def8498fdd ("treewide: Convert macro and uses of
__section(foo) to __section("foo")") removed the stringification of the
section name and now requires quotes around the named section.

Update checkpatch to not remove any quotes when suggesting conversion
of __attribute__((section("name"))) to __section("name")

Miscellanea:

o Add section to the hash with __section replacement
o Remove separate test for __attribute__((section
o Remove the limitation on converting attributes containing only
  known, possible conversions.  Any unknown attribute types are now
  left as-is and known types are converted and moved before
  __attribute__ and removed from within the __attribute__((list...)).
