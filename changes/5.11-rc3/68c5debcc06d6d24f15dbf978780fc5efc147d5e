arm64: implement CPPC FFH support using AMUs

If Activity Monitors (AMUs) are present, two of the counters can be used
to implement support for CPPC's (Collaborative Processor Performance
Control) delivered and reference performance monitoring functionality
using FFH (Functional Fixed Hardware).

Given that counters for a certain CPU can only be read from that CPU,
while FFH operations can be called from any CPU for any of the CPUs, use
smp_call_function_single() to provide the requested values.

Therefore, depending on the register addresses, the following values
are returned:
 - 0x0 (DeliveredPerformanceCounterRegister): AMU core counter
 - 0x1 (ReferencePerformanceCounterRegister): AMU constant counter

The use of Activity Monitors is hidden behind the generic
cpu_read_{corecnt,constcnt}() functions.

Read functionality for these two registers represents the only current
FFH support for CPPC. Read operations for other register values or write
operation for all registers are unsupported. Therefore, keep CPPC's FFH
unsupported if no CPUs have valid AMU frequency counters. For this
purpose, the get_cpu_with_amu_feat() is introduced.
