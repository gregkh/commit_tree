powerpc: Fix update form addressing in inline assembly

In several places, inline assembly uses the "%Un" modifier
to enable the use of instruction with update form addressing,
but the associated "<>" constraint is missing.

As mentioned in previous patch, this fails with gcc 4.9, so
"<>" can't be used directly.

Use UPD_CONSTR macro everywhere %Un modifier is used.
