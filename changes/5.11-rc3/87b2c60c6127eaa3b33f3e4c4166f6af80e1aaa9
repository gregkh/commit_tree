ovl: do not get metacopy for userxattr

When looking up an inode on the lower layer for which the mounter lacks
read permisison the metacopy check will fail.  This causes the lookup to
fail as well, even though the directory is readable.

So ignore EACCES for the "userxattr" case and assume no metacopy for the
unreadable file.
