libceph, ceph: get and handle cluster maps with addrvecs

In preparation for msgr2, make the cluster send us maps with addrvecs
including both LEGACY and MSGR2 addrs instead of a single LEGACY addr.
This means advertising support for SERVER_NAUTILUS and also some older
features: SERVER_MIMIC, MONENC and MONNAMES.

MONNAMES and MONENC are actually pre-argonaut, we just never updated
ceph_monmap_decode() for them.  Decoding is unconditional, see commit
23c625ce3065 ("libceph: assume argonaut on the server side").

SERVER_MIMIC doesn't bear any meaning for the kernel client.

Since ceph_decode_entity_addrvec() is guarded by encoding version
checks (and in msgr2 case it is guarded implicitly by the fact that
server is speaking msgr2), we assume MSG_ADDR2 for it.
