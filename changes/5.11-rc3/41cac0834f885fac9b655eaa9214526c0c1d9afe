kbuild: doc: merge 'Special Rules' and 'Custom kbuild commands' sections

The two sections "3.10 Special Rules" and "7.8 Custom kbuild commands"
are related because you must understand both of them when you write
custom rules.

Actually I do not understand the policy about what to go into
"3 The kbuild files" and what into "7 Architecture Makefile".

This commit reworks the custom rule explanation as follows:

 - Merged "7.8 Custom kbuild commands" into "3.10 Special Rules".

 - Reword "Special Rules" to "Custom Rules" for consistency.

 - Update the example for kecho because the blackfin Makefile
   does not exist any more.

 - Replace the example for cmd_<command> with a simpler one.
