sbitmap: optimise sbitmap_deferred_clear()

Because of spinlocks and atomics sbitmap_deferred_clear() have to reload
&sb->map[index] on each access even though the map address won't change.
Pass in sbitmap_word instead of {sb, index}, so it's cached in a
variable. It also improves code generation of
sbitmap_find_bit_in_index().
