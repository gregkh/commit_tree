drm/i915: Skip over MI_NOOP when parsing

Though less likely in practice, igt uses MI_NOOP frequently to pad out
its batch buffers. The lookup and valiation of so many MI_NOOP command
descriptions is noticeable, though the side-effect of poisoning the
last-validated-command cache is more likely to impact upon real CS.
