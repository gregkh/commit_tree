rtlwifi: rtl8192de: avoid accessing the data mapped to streaming DMA

In rtl92de_tx_fill_cmddesc(), skb->data is mapped to streaming DMA on
line 667:
  dma_addr_t mapping = dma_map_single(..., skb->data, ...);

On line 669, skb->data is assigned to hdr after cast:
  struct ieee80211_hdr *hdr = (struct ieee80211_hdr *)(skb->data);

Then hdr->frame_control is accessed on line 670:
  __le16 fc = hdr->frame_control;

This DMA access may cause data inconsistency between CPU and hardwre.

To fix this bug, hdr->frame_control is accessed before the DMA mapping.
