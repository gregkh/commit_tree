PCI: tegra: Disable LTSSM during L2 entry

PCIe cards like Marvell SATA controller and some of the Samsung NVMe
drives don't support taking the link to L2 state. When the link doesn't
go to L2 state, Tegra194 requires the LTSSM to be disabled to allow PHY
to start the next link up process cleanly during suspend/resume sequence.
Failing to disable LTSSM results in the PCIe link not coming up in the
next resume cycle.
