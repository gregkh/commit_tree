io_uring: synchronise ev_posted() with waitqueues

waitqueue_active() needs smp_mb() to be in sync with waitqueues
modification, but we miss it in io_cqring_ev_posted*() apart from
cq_wait() case.

Take an smb_mb() out of wq_has_sleeper() making it waitqueue_active(),
and place it a few lines before, so it can synchronise other
waitqueue_active() as well.

The patch doesn't add any additional overhead, so even if there are
no problems currently, it's just safer to have it this way.
