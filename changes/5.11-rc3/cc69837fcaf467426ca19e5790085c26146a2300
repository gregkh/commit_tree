net: don't include ethtool.h from netdevice.h

linux/netdevice.h is included in very many places, touching any
of its dependecies causes large incremental builds.

Drop the linux/ethtool.h include, linux/netdevice.h just needs
a forward declaration of struct ethtool_ops.

Fix all the places which made use of this implicit include.
