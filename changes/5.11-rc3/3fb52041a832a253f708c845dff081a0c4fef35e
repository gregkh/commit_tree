scsi: libfc: Fix enum-conversion warning

gcc -Wextra points out an assignment between two different enum types:

drivers/scsi/libfc/fc_exch.c: In function 'fc_exch_setup_hdr':
../drivers/scsi/libfc/fc_exch.c:275:26: warning: implicit conversion from 'enum fc_class' to 'enum fc_sof' [-Wenum-conversion]

This seems to be intentional, as the same numeric values are used here, so
shut up the warning by adding an explicit cast.
