ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk for RC-505

BOSS RC-505 (shown by lsusb as "Roland Corp. RC-505") does require the
same quirk as these other BOSS devices.

Without this quirk it is neither possible to capture audio from nor to
write audio to the RC-505. Both just result in an empty audio
stream. With these changes both capture and playback seem to work
quite fine. MIDI funtionality was not tested.
