AMD_SFH: Fix for incorrect Sensor index

It appears like the accelerometer/magnetometer and gyroscope indices were
interchanged in the patch series which got into for-5.11/amd-sfh-hid until
Mandoli/Richard reported to us.  Ideally sensor indices should be 0,1,2 for the
accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer respectively, but this interchanged
possibly could be because i was using a test MP2 firmware on my machine.

This patch fixes the earlier commit with the right sensor indices and also
removing unused structures _hid_report_descriptor, _hid_device_descriptor as
reported by Richard.
