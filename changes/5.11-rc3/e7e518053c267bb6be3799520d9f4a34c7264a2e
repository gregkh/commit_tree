bpf: Add schedule point in htab_init_buckets()

We noticed that with a LOCKDEP enabled kernel,
allocating a hash table with 65536 buckets would
use more than 60ms.

htab_init_buckets() runs from process context,
it is safe to schedule to avoid latency spikes.

Fixes: c50eb518e262 ("bpf: Use separate lockdep class for each hashtab")
