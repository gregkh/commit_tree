samples/bpf: Sample application for eBPF load and socket creation split

Introduce a sample program to demonstrate the control and data
plane split. For the control plane part a new program called
xdpsock_ctrl_proc is introduced. For the data plane part, some code
was added to xdpsock_user.c to act as the data plane entity.

Application xdpsock_ctrl_proc works as control entity with sudo
privileges (CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_NET_ADMIN are sufficient) and the
extended xdpsock as data plane entity with CAP_NET_RAW capability
only.

Usage example:

sudo ./samples/bpf/xdpsock_ctrl_proc -i <interface>

sudo ./samples/bpf/xdpsock -i <interface> -q <queue_id>
	-n <interval> -N -l -R
