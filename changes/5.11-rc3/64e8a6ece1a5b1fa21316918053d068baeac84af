block/rnbd-clt: Dynamically alloc buffer for pathname & blk_symlink_name

For every rnbd_clt_dev, we alloc the pathname and blk_symlink_name
statically to NAME_MAX which is 255 bytes. In most of the cases we only
need less than 10 bytes, so 500 bytes per block device are wasted.

This commit dynamically allocates memory buffer for pathname and
blk_symlink_name.
