mlxsw: Add QinQ configuration vetoes

After adding support for QinQ, a.k.a 802.1ad protocol, there are a few
scenarios that should be vetoed.

The vetoes are motivated by various ASIC limitations.
For example, a port that is member in a 802.1ad bridge cannot have 802.1q
uppers as the port needs to be configured to treat 802.1q packets as
untagged packets.

Veto all those unsupported scenarios and return suitable messages.
