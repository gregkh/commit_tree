media: coda: Remove redundant ctx->initialized setting

The ctx->initialized flag is set in __coda_decoder_seq_init,
so it's redundant to set it in coda_dec_seq_init_work.
Remove the redundant set, which allows to simplify the
implementation quite a bit.

This change shouldn't affect functionality as it's just
cosmetics.
