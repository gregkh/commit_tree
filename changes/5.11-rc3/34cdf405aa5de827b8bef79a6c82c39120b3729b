ALSA: hda/realtek: Remove dummy lineout on Acer TravelMate P648/P658

Acer TravelMate laptops P648/P658 series with codec ALC282 only have
one physical jack for headset but there's a confusing lineout pin on
NID 0x1b reported. Audio applications hence misunderstand that there
are a speaker and a lineout, and take the lineout as the default audio
output.

Add a new quirk to remove the useless lineout and enable the pin 0x18
for jack sensing and headset microphone.
