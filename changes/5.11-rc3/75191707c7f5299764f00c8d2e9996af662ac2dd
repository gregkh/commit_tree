can: update documentation for DLC usage in Classical CAN

The extension of struct can_frame with the len8_dlc element and the
can_dlc naming issue required an update of the documentation.

Additionally introduce the term 'Classical CAN' which has been established
by CAN in Automation to separate the original CAN2.0 A/B from CAN FD.

Updated some data structures and flags.
