drm/amd/display: Decouple amdgpu_dm_trace from service

Our DC currently uses some of the tracepoint function inside a DC
header, which means that many other files implicitly include part of the
trace function. This situation limits how we can expand this feature for
other parts of the driver by generating multiple compilation errors when
we try to reuse some of the existing structures. This commit decouples
part of the amdgpu_dm_trace from DC core to simplify the trace
enlargement in future changes.
