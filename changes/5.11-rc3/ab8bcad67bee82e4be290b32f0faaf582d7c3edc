tools/memory-model: Move Documentation description to Documentation/README

This commit moves the descriptions of the files residing in
tools/memory-model/Documentation to a README file in that directory,
leaving behind the description of tools/memory-model/Documentation/README
itself.  After this change, tools/memory-model/Documentation/README
provides a guide to the files in the tools/memory-model/Documentation
directory, guiding people with different skills and needs to the most
appropriate starting point.
