ASoC: sun8i-codec: Program DAI format before clock inversion

The LRCK inversion bit has a different meaning in DSP mode: it selects
between the DSP A and DSP B formats. To support this, we need to know if
the selected format is a DSP format. One easy way to do this is to set
the format field before the clock inversion fields.
