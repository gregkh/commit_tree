interconnect: qcom: sdm845: Add the missing nodes for QUP

The QUP nodes are currently defined just as entries in the topology,
but they are not referenced by any of the NoCs. Let's fix this and
"attach" them to their NoCs, so that the QUP drivers are able to use
them as path endpoints and scale their bandwidth.

This is based on the information from the downstream msm-4.9 kernel.
