io_uring: always batch cancel in *cancel_files()

Instead of iterating over each request and cancelling it individually in
io_uring_cancel_files(), try to cancel all matching requests and use
->inflight_list only to check if there anything left.

In many cases it should be faster, and we can reuse a lot of code from
task cancellation.
