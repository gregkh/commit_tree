ovl: simplify file splice

generic_file_splice_read() and iter_file_splice_write() will call back into
f_op->iter_read() and f_op->iter_write() respectively.  These already do
the real file lookup and cred override.  So the code in ovl_splice_read()
and ovl_splice_write() is redundant.

In addition the ovl_file_accessed() call in ovl_splice_write() is
incorrect, though probably harmless.

Fix by calling generic_file_splice_read() and iter_file_splice_write()
directly.
