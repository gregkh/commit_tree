soc: ti: Fix reference imbalance in knav_dma_probe

The patch fix two reference leak.

  1) pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even it
     failed. Forgetting to call put operation will result in
     reference leak.

  2) The pm_runtime_enable will increase power disable depth. Thus
     a pairing decrement is needed on the error handling path to
     keep it balanced.

We fix it by: 1) adding call pm_runtime_put_noidle or
pm_runtime_put_sync in error handling. 2) adding pm_runtime_disable
in error handling, to keep usage counter and disable depth balanced.
