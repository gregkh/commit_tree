media: camss: csiphy: Set rate on csiX_phy clock on SDM630/660

The SDM630/660 SoCs (and variants) have another clock source
for the PHY, which must be set to a rate that's equal or
greater than the CSI PHY timer clock: failing to do this
will produce PHY overflows when trying to get a stream from
a very high bandwidth camera sensor and outputting no frame
or a partial one.

Since I haven't found any usecase in which the csiX_phy
clock needs to be higher than the csiXphy_timer, let's just
set the same rate on both, which seems to work just perfect.
