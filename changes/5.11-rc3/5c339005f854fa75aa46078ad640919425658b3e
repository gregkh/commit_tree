sched: Avoid unnecessary calculation of load imbalance at clone time

In find_idlest_group(), the load imbalance is only relevant when the group
is either overloaded or fully busy but it is calculated unconditionally.
This patch moves the imbalance calculation to the context it is required.
Technically, it is a micro-optimisation but really the benefit is avoiding
confusing one type of imbalance with another depending on the group_type
in the next patch.

No functional change.
