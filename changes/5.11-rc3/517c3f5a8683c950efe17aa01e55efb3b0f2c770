pinctrl: mtk: Fix low level output voltage issue

This patch is used to fix low level output voltage issue.
A pin is changed from input pull-up to output high.
The Dout value of the pin is default as 0.
If we change the direction of the pin before the dout value of the pin,
It maybe produce a low level output voltage between "input pull-up" and
"output high".
