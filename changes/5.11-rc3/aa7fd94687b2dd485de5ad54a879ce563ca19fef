iwlwifi: pcie: remove MSIX_HW_INT_CAUSES_REG_IML handling

This is actually wrong, the bit used here by the image loader
is BIT(1), not BIT(2). The latter will be reused by the new
reset flow soon.

However, as we never had any complaints about not printing
the IML status or not handling the IML error interrupt (and
I suspect the code handling it was incorrectly anyway) just
remove the code for it.
