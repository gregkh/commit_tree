net/mlx5: Fix compilation warning for 32-bit platform

MLX5_GENERAL_OBJECT_TYPES types bitfield is 64-bit field.

Defining an enum for such bit fields on 32-bit platform results in below
warning.

./include/vdso/bits.h:7:26: warning: left shift count >= width of type [-Wshift-count-overflow]
                         ^
./include/linux/mlx5/mlx5_ifc.h:10716:46: note: in expansion of macro ‘BIT’
 MLX5_HCA_CAP_GENERAL_OBJECT_TYPES_SAMPLER = BIT(0x20),
                                             ^~~

Use 32-bit friendly BIT_ULL macro.
