bpf: Expose bpf_sk_storage_* to iterator programs

Iterators are currently used to expose kernel information to userspace
over fast procfs-like files but iterators could also be used to
manipulate local storage. For example, the task_file iterator could be
used to initialize a socket local storage with associations between
processes and sockets or to selectively delete local storage values.
