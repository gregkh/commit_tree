btrfs: get zone information of zoned block devices

If a zoned block device is found, get its zone information (number of
zones and zone size).  To avoid costly run-time zone report
commands to test the device zones type during block allocation, attach
the seq_zones bitmap to the device structure to indicate if a zone is
sequential or accept random writes. Also it attaches the empty_zones
bitmap to indicate if a zone is empty or not.

This patch also introduces the helper function btrfs_dev_is_sequential()
to test if the zone storing a block is a sequential write required zone
and btrfs_dev_is_empty_zone() to test if the zone is a empty zone.
