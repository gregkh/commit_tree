media: gp8psk: initialize stats at power control logic

As reported on:
	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/20190627222020.45909-1-willemdebruijn.kernel@gmail.com/

if gp8psk_usb_in_op() returns an error, the status var is not
initialized. Yet, this var is used later on, in order to
identify:
	- if the device was already started;
	- if firmware has loaded;
	- if the LNBf was powered on.

Using status = 0 seems to ensure that everything will be
properly powered up.

So, instead of the proposed solution, let's just set
status = 0.
