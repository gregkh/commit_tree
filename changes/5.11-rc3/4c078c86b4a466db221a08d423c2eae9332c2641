powerpc/boot/wrapper: Add "-z notext" flag to disable diagnostic

The "-z notext" flag disables reporting an error if DT_TEXTREL is set.

  ld.lld: error: can't create dynamic relocation R_PPC64_ADDR64 against
    symbol: _start in readonly segment; recompile object files with
    -fPIC or pass '-Wl,-z,notext' to allow text relocations in the
    output
  >>> defined in
  >>> referenced by crt0.o:(.text+0x8) in archive arch/powerpc/boot/wrapper.a

The BFD linker disables this by default (though it's configurable in
current versions). LLD enables this by default. So we add the flag to
keep LLD from emitting the error.
