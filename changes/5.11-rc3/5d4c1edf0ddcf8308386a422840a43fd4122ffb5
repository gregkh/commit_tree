drm/qxl: replace idr_init() by idr_init_base()

idr_init() uses base 0 which is an invalid identifier for this driver.
The idr_alloc for this driver uses 1 as start value for ID range. The
new function idr_init_base allows IDR to set the ID lookup from base 1.
This avoids all lookups that otherwise starts from 0 since 0 is always
unused / available.
