nbd: use set_capacity_and_notify

Use set_capacity_and_notify to update the disk and block device sizes and
send a RESIZE uevent to userspace.  Note that blktests relies on uevents
being sent also for updates that did not change the device size, so the
explicit kobject_uevent remains for that case.
