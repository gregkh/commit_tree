bpf: Implement get_current_task_btf and RET_PTR_TO_BTF_ID

The currently available bpf_get_current_task returns an unsigned integer
which can be used along with BPF_CORE_READ to read data from
the task_struct but still cannot be used as an input argument to a
helper that accepts an ARG_PTR_TO_BTF_ID of type task_struct.

In order to implement this helper a new return type, RET_PTR_TO_BTF_ID,
is added. This is similar to RET_PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL but does not
require checking the nullness of returned pointer.
