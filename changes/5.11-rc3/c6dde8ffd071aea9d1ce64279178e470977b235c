ALSA: usb-audio: Fix control 'access overflow' errors from chmap

The current channel-map control implementation in USB-audio driver may
lead to an error message like
  "control 3:0:0:Playback Channel Map:0: access overflow"
when CONFIG_SND_CTL_VALIDATION is set.  It's because the chmap get
callback clears the whole array no matter which count is set, and
rather the false-positive detection.

This patch fixes the problem by clearing only the needed array range
at usb_chmap_ctl_get().
