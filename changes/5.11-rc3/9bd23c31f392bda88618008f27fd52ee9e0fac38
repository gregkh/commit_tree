jbd2: add a helper to find out number of fast commit blocks

Add a helper to read number of fast commit blocks from jbd2 superblock
and also rename the JBD2_MIN_FC_BLKS to
JBD2_DEFAULT_FAST_COMMIT_BLOCKS since this constant is just the
default number of fast commit blocks to use in case number of fast
commit blocks isn't set in jbd2 superblock.
