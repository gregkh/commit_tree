iommu/vt-d: Fix ineffective devTLB invalidation for subdevices

iommu_flush_dev_iotlb() is called to invalidate caches on a device but
only loops over the devices which are fully-attached to the domain. For
sub-devices, this is ineffective and can result in invalid caching
entries left on the device.

Fix the missing invalidation by adding a loop over the subdevices and
ensuring that 'domain->has_iotlb_device' is updated when attaching to
subdevices.
