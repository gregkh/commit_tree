clk: imx8mm: drop of_match_ptr from of_device_id table

The driver can match only via the DT table so the table should be always
used and the of_match_ptr does not have any sense (this also allows ACPI
matching via PRP0001, even though it might be not relevant here).  This
fixes compile warning (!CONFIG_OF && !CONFIG_MODULES):

    drivers/clk/imx/clk-imx8mm.c:641:34: warning:
        ‘imx8mm_clk_of_match’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
