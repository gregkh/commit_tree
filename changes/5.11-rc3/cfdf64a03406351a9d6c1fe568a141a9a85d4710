seg6: add callbacks for customizing the creation/destruction of a behavior

We introduce two callbacks used for customizing the creation/destruction of
a SRv6 behavior. Such callbacks are defined in the new struct
seg6_local_lwtunnel_ops and hereafter we provide a brief description of
them:

 - build_state(...): used for calling the custom constructor of the
   behavior during its initialization phase and after all the attributes
   have been parsed successfully;

 - destroy_state(...): used for calling the custom destructor of the
   behavior before it is completely destroyed.
