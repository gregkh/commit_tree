ASoC: rt1015p: delay 300ms after SDB pulling high for calibration

RT1015p needs 300ms delay after SDB pulling high for internal
calibration during the power on sequence.

Delays 300ms right before data sends out to avoid data truncated.

Assuming the calibration state gets lost after system suspend.
