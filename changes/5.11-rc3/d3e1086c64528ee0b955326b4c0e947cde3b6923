KVM: arm64: Init MAIR/TCR_EL2 from params struct

MAIR_EL2 and TCR_EL2 are currently initialized from their _EL1 values.
This will not work once KVM starts intercepting PSCI ON/SUSPEND SMCs
and initializing EL2 state before EL1 state.

Obtain the EL1 values during KVM init and store them in the init params
struct. The struct will stay in memory and can be used when booting new
cores.

Take the opportunity to move copying the T0SZ value from idmap_t0sz in
KVM init rather than in .hyp.idmap.text. This avoids the need for the
idmap_t0sz symbol alias.
