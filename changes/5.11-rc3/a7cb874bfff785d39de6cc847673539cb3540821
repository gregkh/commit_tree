mm: memcg: fix obsolete code comments

This patch fixes/removes some obsolete comments in the code related
to the kernel memory accounting:

 - kmem_cache->memcg_params.memcg_caches has been removed by commit
   9855609bde03 ("mm: memcg/slab: use a single set of kmem_caches for
   all accounted allocations")

 - memcg->kmemcg_id is not used as a gate for kmem accounting since
   commit 0b8f73e10428 ("mm: memcontrol: clean up alloc, online,
   offline, free functions")
