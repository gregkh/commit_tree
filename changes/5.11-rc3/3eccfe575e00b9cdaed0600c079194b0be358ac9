dt-bindings:iio:dac:ti,dac5571 yaml conversion.

A few tweaks in this conversion.
* The example didn't have the I2C address of 4C in the node name so
  fixed that.
* The reference voltage in the txt file is an optional binding, but
  the driver is making use of it to provide the scaling of the output
  channels.  As such I have made it required going forwards.
