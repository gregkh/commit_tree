dmaengine: dw-edma: Fix use after free in dw_edma_alloc_chunk()

If the dw_edma_alloc_burst() function fails then we free "chunk" but
it's still on the "desc->chunk->list" list so it will lead to a use
after free.  Also the "->chunks_alloc" count is incremented when it
shouldn't be.

In current kernels small allocations are guaranteed to succeed and
dw_edma_alloc_burst() can't fail so this will not actually affect
runtime.
