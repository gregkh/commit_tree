platform/x86: mlx-platform: Remove PSU EEPROM from default platform configuration

Remove PSU EEPROM configuration for systems class equipped with
Mellanox chip Spectrum and Celeron CPU - system types MSN2700, MSN2100.
Till now all the systems from this class used few types of power units,
all equipped with EEPROM device with address space two bytes. Thus, all
these devices have been handled by EEPROM driver "24c02".

There is a new requirement is to support power unit replacement by "off
the shelf" device, matching electrical required parameters. Such device
can be equipped with different EEPROM type, which could be one byte
address space addressing or even could be not equipped with EEPROM.
In such case "24c02" will not work.

Fixes: ba814fdd0 ("platform/x86: mlx-platform: Use defines for bus assignment")
