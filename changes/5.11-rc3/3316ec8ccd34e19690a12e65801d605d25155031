x86/elf: Use e_machine to check for x32/ia32 in setup_additional_pages()

Since TIF_X32 is going away, avoid using it to find the ELF type when
choosing which additional pages to set up.

According to SysV AMD64 ABI Draft, an AMD64 ELF object using ILP32 must
have ELFCLASS32 with (E_MACHINE == EM_X86_64), so use that ELF field to
differentiate a x32 object from a IA32 object when executing
setup_additional_pages() in compat mode.
