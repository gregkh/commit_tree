drm/amd/display: Don't invoke kgdb_breakpoint() unconditionally

ASSERT_CRITICAL() invokes kgdb_breakpoint() whenever either
CONFIG_KGDB or CONFIG_HAVE_KGDB is set.  This, however, may lead to a
kernel panic when no kdb stuff is attached, since the
kgdb_breakpoint() call issues INT3.  It's nothing but a surprise for
normal end-users.

For avoiding the pitfall, make the kgdb_breakpoint() call only when
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL_DC is set.
