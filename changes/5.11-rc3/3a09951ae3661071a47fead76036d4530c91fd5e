scsi: 3w-9xxx: Drop PCI Wakeup calls from .resume

The driver calls pci_enable_wake(...., false) in twa_resume(), and there is
no corresponding pci_enable_wake(...., true) in twa_suspend().  Either it
should do enable-wake the device in .suspend() or should not invoke
pci_enable_wake() at all.

Concluding that this driver doesn't support enable-wake and PCI core calls
pci_enable_wake(pci_dev, PCI_D0, false) during resume, drop it from
twa_resume().
