habanalabs: add validation cs counter, fix misplaced counters

Up until now validation errors were counted in the parsing field
of the cs_counters struct, so we added a new counter and increased
it when needed.

In addition, there were some locations where only one of the counters
was updated (ctx or aggregate) so add the second one to be updated
as well.
