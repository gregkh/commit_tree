net: warn if gso_type isn't set for a GSO SKB

In bug report [0] a warning in r8169 driver was reported that was
caused by an invalid GSO SKB (gso_type was 0). See [1] for a discussion
about this issue. Still the origin of the invalid GSO SKB isn't clear.

It shouldn't be a network drivers task to check for invalid GSO SKB's.
Also, even if issue [0] can be fixed, we can't be sure that a
similar issue doesn't pop up again at another place.
Therefore let gso_features_check() check for such invalid GSO SKB's.
