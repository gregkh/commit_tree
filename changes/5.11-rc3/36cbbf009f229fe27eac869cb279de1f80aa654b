ASoC: pcm1789: skip of_device_id table when !CONFIG_OF

The driver can match by multiple methods.  Its of_device_id table is
referenced via of_match_ptr() so it will be unused for !CONFIG_OF
builds:

  sound/soc/codecs/pcm1789-i2c.c:36:34: warning: ‘pcm1789_of_match’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
