serial_core: Check for port state when tty is in error state

At the moment opening a serial device node (such as /dev/ttyS3)
succeeds even if there is no actual serial device behind it.
Reading/writing/ioctls fail as expected because the uart port is not
initialized (the type is PORT_UNKNOWN) and the TTY_IO_ERROR error state
bit is set fot the tty.

However setting line discipline does not have these checks
8250_port.c (8250 is the default choice made by univ8250_console_init()).
As the result of PORT_UNKNOWN, uart_port::iobase is NULL which
a platform translates onto some address accessing which produces a crash
like below.

This adds tty_port_initialized() to uart_set_ldisc() to prevent the crash.
