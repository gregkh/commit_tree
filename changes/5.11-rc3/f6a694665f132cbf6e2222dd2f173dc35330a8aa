tracing: Offload eval map updates to a work queue

In order for tracepoints to export their enums to user space, the use of the
TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM() macro is used. On boot up, the strings shown in the
tracefs "print fmt" lines are processed, and all the enums registered by
TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM are replaced with the interger value. This way, userspace
tools that read the raw binary data, knows how to evaluate the raw events.

This is currently done in an initcall, but it has been noticed that slow
embedded boards that have tracing may take a few seconds to process them
all, and a few seconds slow down on an embedded device is detrimental to the
system.

Instead, offload the work to a work queue and make sure that its finished by
destroying the work queue (which flushes all work) in a late initcall. This
will allow the system to continue to boot and run the updates in the
background, and this speeds up the boot time. Note, the strings being
updated are only used by user space, so finishing the process before the
system is fully booted will prevent any race issues.
