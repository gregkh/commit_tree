mmc: tmio: Fix command error processing

If some errors are detected at the same time as the access end
interrupt, the access end interrupt was not cleared. Especially with
DMA, because then the access end interrupt was never enabled and, thus,
never cleared. Clear the interrupt register always when a command error
occurs.
