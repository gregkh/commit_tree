net/packet: make packet_fanout.arr size configurable up to 64K

One use case of PACKET_FANOUT is lockless reception with one socket
per CPU. 256 is a practical limit on increasingly many machines.

Increase PACKET_FANOUT_MAX to 64K. Expand setsockopt PACKET_FANOUT to
take an extra argument max_num_members. Also explicitly define a
fanout_args struct, instead of implicitly casting to an integer. This
documents the API and simplifies the control flow.

If max_num_members is not specified or is set to 0, then 256 is used,
same as before.
