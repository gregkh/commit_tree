iwlwifi: mvm: clean up scan state on failure

We keep the scan status per UID in scan_uid_status field when the
iwl_mvm_build_scan_cmd() function is called. If we error out after
this, e.g. due to FW restart being in progress, we're not cleaning
up properly, and can run into warnings later.

Clean up internal variables when starting fails after calling the
iwl_mvm_build_scan_cmd() function.
