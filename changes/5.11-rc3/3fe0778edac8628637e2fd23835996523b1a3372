x86/sgx: Add an SGX misc driver interface

Intel(R) SGX is a new hardware functionality that can be used by
applications to set aside private regions of code and data called
enclaves. New hardware protects enclave code and data from outside
access and modification.

Add a driver that presents a device file and ioctl API to build and
manage enclaves.
