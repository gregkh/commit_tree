mtd: spi-nor: add support for DTR protocol

Double Transfer Rate (DTR) is SPI protocol in which data is transferred
on each clock edge as opposed to on each clock cycle. Make
framework-level changes to allow supporting flashes in DTR mode.

Right now, mixed DTR modes are not supported. So, for example a mode
like 4S-4D-4D will not work. All phases need to be either DTR or STR.

The xSPI spec says that "The program commands provide SPI backward
compatible commands for programming data...". So 8D-8D-8D page program
opcodes are populated with using 1S-1S-1S opcodes.
