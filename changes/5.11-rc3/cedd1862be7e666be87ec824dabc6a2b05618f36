depmod: handle the case of /sbin/depmod without /sbin in PATH

Commit 436e980e2ed5 ("kbuild: don't hardcode depmod path") stopped
hard-coding the path of depmod, but in the process caused trouble for
distributions that had that /sbin location, but didn't have it in the
PATH (generally because /sbin is limited to the super-user path).

Work around it for now by just adding /sbin to the end of PATH in the
depmod.sh script.
