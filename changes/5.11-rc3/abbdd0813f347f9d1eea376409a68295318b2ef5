bpf: Eliminate rlimit-based memory accounting for bpf ringbuffer

Do not use rlimit-based memory accounting for bpf ringbuffer.
It has been replaced with the memcg-based memory accounting.

bpf_ringbuf_alloc() can't return anything except ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM)
and a valid pointer, so to simplify the code make it return NULL
in the first case. This allows to drop a couple of lines in
ringbuf_map_alloc() and also makes it look similar to other memory
allocating function like kmalloc().
