net: ipa: print channel/event ring number on error

When a GSI command is used to change the state of a channel or event
ring we check the state before and after the command to ensure it is
as expected.  If not, we print an error message, but it does not
include the channel or event ring id, and it easily can.  Add the
channel or event ring id to these error messages.
