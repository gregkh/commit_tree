bpf: In bpf_task_fd_query use fget_task

Use the helper fget_task to simplify bpf_task_fd_query.

As well as simplifying the code this removes one unnecessary increment of
struct files_struct.  This unnecessary increment of files_struct.count can
result in exec unnecessarily unsharing files_struct and breaking posix
locks, and it can result in fget_light having to fallback to fget reducing
performance.

This simplification comes from the observation that none of the
callers of get_files_struct actually need to call get_files_struct
that was made when discussing[1] exec and posix file locks.
