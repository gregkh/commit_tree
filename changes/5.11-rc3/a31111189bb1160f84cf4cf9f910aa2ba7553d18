rtc: ds1307: Remove non-valid ACPI IDs

The commit 9c19b8930d2c ("rtc: ds1307: Add ACPI support") added invalid
ACPI IDs (all of them are abusing ACPI specification). Moreover there is
not even a single evidence that vendor registered any of such devices.

Remove broken ACPI IDs from the driver. For prototyping one may use PRP0001
with device properties adhering to a DT binding. The following patches
will add support of that to the driver.
