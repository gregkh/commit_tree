x86/asm: Drop unused RDPID macro

Drop the GAS-compatible RDPID macro. RDPID is unsafe in the kernel
because KVM loads guest's TSC_AUX on VM-entry and may not restore the
host's value until the CPU returns to userspace.

See

  6a3ea3e68b8a ("x86/entry/64: Do not use RDPID in paranoid entry to accomodate KVM")

for details.

It can always be resurrected from git history, if needed.
