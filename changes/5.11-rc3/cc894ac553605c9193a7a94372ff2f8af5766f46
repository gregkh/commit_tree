HID: sony: support for ghlive ps3/wii u dongles

This commit adds support for the Guitar Hero Live PS3 and Wii U dongles.

These dongles require a "magic" USB control message [1] to be sent
approximately every 10 seconds otherwise the dongle will not report
events where the strumbar is hit while a fret is being held.

Also, inspired by a patch sent on linux-input by Sanjay Govind [2], the
accelerometer is mapped to ABS_RY for tilt.

Interestingly, the Wii U and PS3 dongles share the same VID and PID.
