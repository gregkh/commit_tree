KVM: PPC: BOOK3S: PR: Ignore UAMOR SPR

With power7 and above we expect the cpu to support keys. The
number of keys are firmware controlled based on device tree.
PR KVM do not expose key details via device tree. Hence when running with PR KVM
we do run with MMU_FTR_KEY support disabled. But we can still
get updates on UAMOR. Hence ignore access to them and for mfstpr return
0 indicating no AMR/IAMR update is no allowed.
