ARM: highmem: Fix cache_is_vivt() reference

The reference to cache_is_vivt() was moved into a header file,
which now causes a build failure in rare randconfig builds:

arch/arm/include/asm/highmem.h:52:43: error: implicit declaration of function 'cache_is_vivt' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

Add an explicit include to make it build reliably.
