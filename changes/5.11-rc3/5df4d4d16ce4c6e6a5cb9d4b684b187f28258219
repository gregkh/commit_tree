arm64: dts: rockchip: Enable analog audio on rk3328-roc-cc

Now that driver support for the RK3328's audio codec, and the plumbing
is defined at the SoC level, we can enable analog audio at the board
level.

Enable analog audio by enabling the codec and the I2S interface
connected and the simple-audio-card that binds them together.
