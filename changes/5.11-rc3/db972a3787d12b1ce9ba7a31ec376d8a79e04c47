powerpc/powermac: Fix low_sleep_handler with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK

low_sleep_handler() can't restore the context from standard
stack because the stack can hardly be accessed with MMU OFF.

Store everything in a global storage area instead of storing
a pointer to the stack in that global storage area.

To avoid a complete churn of the function, still use r1 as
the pointer to the storage area during restore.
