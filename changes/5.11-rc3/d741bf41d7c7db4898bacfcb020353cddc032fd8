kprobes: Remove kretprobe hash

The kretprobe hash is mostly superfluous, replace it with a per-task
variable.

This gets rid of the task hash and it's related locking.

Note that this may change the kprobes module-exported API for kretprobe
handlers. If any out-of-tree kretprobe user uses ri->rp, use
get_kretprobe(ri) instead.
