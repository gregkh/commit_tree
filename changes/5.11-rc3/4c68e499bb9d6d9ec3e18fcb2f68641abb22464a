dma-buf: heaps: Skip sync if not mapped

This patch is basically a port of Ørjan Eide's similar patch for ION
 https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200414134629.54567-1-orjan.eide@arm.com/

Only sync the sg-list of dma-buf heap attachment when the attachment
is actually mapped on the device.

dma-bufs may be synced at any time. It can be reached from user space
via DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC, so there are no guarantees from callers on when
syncs may be attempted, and dma_buf_end_cpu_access() and
dma_buf_begin_cpu_access() may not be paired.

Since the sg_list's dma_address isn't set up until the buffer is used
on the device, and dma_map_sg() is called on it, the dma_address will be
NULL if sync is attempted on the dma-buf before it's mapped on a device.

Before v5.0 (commit 55897af63091 ("dma-direct: merge swiotlb_dma_ops
into the dma_direct code")) this was a problem as the dma-api (at least
the swiotlb_dma_ops on arm64) would use the potentially invalid
dma_address. How that failed depended on how the device handled physical
address 0. If 0 was a valid address to physical ram, that page would get
flushed a lot, while the actual pages in the buffer would not get synced
correctly. While if 0 is an invalid physical address it may cause a
fault and trigger a crash.

In v5.0 this was incidentally fixed by commit 55897af63091 ("dma-direct:
merge swiotlb_dma_ops into the dma_direct code"), as this moved the
dma-api to use the page pointer in the sg_list, and (for Ion buffers at
least) this will always be valid if the sg_list exists at all.

But, this issue is re-introduced in v5.3 with
commit 449fa54d6815 ("dma-direct: correct the physical addr in
dma_direct_sync_sg_for_cpu/device") moves the dma-api back to the old
behaviour and picks the dma_address that may be invalid.

dma-buf core doesn't ensure that the buffer is mapped on the device, and
thus have a valid sg_list, before calling the exporter's
begin_cpu_access.
