net: bonding, dummy, ifb, team: advertise NETIF_F_GSO_SOFTWARE

Virtual netdevs should use NETIF_F_GSO_SOFTWARE to forward GSO skbs
as-is and let the final drivers deal with them when supported.
Also remove NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_L4 from bonding and team drivers as it's
now included in the "software" list.
