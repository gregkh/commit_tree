net: ipa: define clock and interconnect data

Define a new type of configuration data, used to initialize the
IPA core clock and interconnects.  This is the first of three
patches, and defines the data types and interface but doesn't
yet use them.

Switch the return value if there is no matching configuration data
to ENODEV instead of ENOTSUPP (to avoid using the nonstandard errno).
