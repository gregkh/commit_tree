x86/mce: Rename kill_it to kill_current_task

Currently, if an MCE happens in user-mode or while the kernel is copying
data from user space, 'kill_it' is used to check if execution of the
interrupted task can be recovered or not; the flag name however is not
very meaningful, hence rename it to match its goal.

 [ bp: Massage commit message, rename the queue_task_work() arg too. ]
