PCI: tegra: Move "dbi" accesses to post common DWC initialization

commit a0fd361db8e5 ("PCI: dwc: Move "dbi", "dbi2", and "addr_space"
resource setup into common code") moved the code that sets up dbi_base
to DWC common code thereby creating a requirement to not access the "dbi"
region before calling common DWC initialization code. But, Tegra194
already had some code that programs some of the "dbi" registers resulting
in system crash. This patch addresses that issue by refactoring the code
to have accesses to the "dbi" region only after common DWC initialization.
