ASoC: SOF: loader: do not warn about unknown firmware headers

The firmware extended data IPC and manifest structures are designed to
be extendable without breaking the driver-firmware ABI. Driver should
not raise a warning in case a new header type is detected at
firmware boot. There are already checks for IPC ABI compatibility in
snd_sof_ipc_valid() and if the versions are deemed compatible, extra
fields in IPC messages should not trigger warnings.
