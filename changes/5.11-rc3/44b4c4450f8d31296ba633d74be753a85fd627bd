powerpc/64s: Mark the kuap/kuep functions non __init

The kernel calls these functions on CPU online and hence they must not
be marked __init.

Otherwise if the memory they occupied has been reused the system can
crash in various ways. Sachin reported it caused his LPAR to
spontaneously restart with no other output. With xmon enabled it may
drop into xmon with a dump like:
