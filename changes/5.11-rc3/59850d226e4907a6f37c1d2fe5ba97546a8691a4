io_uring: fix io_cqring_events()'s noflush

Checking !list_empty(&ctx->cq_overflow_list) around noflush in
io_cqring_events() is racy, because if it fails but a request overflowed
just after that, io_cqring_overflow_flush() still will be called.

Remove the second check, it shouldn't be a problem for performance,
because there is cq_check_overflow bit check just above.
