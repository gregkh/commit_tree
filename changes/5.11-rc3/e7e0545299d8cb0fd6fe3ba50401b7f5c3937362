x86/sgx: Initialize metadata for Enclave Page Cache (EPC) sections

Although carved out of normal DRAM, enclave memory is marked in the
system memory map as reserved and is not managed by the core mm.  There
may be several regions spread across the system.  Each contiguous region
is called an Enclave Page Cache (EPC) section.  EPC sections are
enumerated via CPUID

Enclave pages can only be accessed when they are mapped as part of an
enclave, by a hardware thread running inside the enclave.

Parse CPUID data, create metadata for EPC pages and populate a simple
EPC page allocator.  Although much smaller, ‘struct sgx_epc_page’
metadata is the SGX analog of the core mm ‘struct page’.

Similar to how the core mm’s page->flags encode zone and NUMA
information, embed the EPC section index to the first eight bits of
sgx_epc_page->desc.  This allows a quick reverse lookup from EPC page to
EPC section.  Existing client hardware supports only a single section,
while upcoming server hardware will support at most eight sections.
Thus, eight bits should be enough for long term needs.
