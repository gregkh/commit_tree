remoteproc: qcom: Add capability to collect minidumps

This patch adds support for collecting minidump in the event of remoteproc
crash. Parse the minidump table based on remoteproc's unique minidump-id,
read all memory regions from the remoteproc's minidump table entry and
expose the memory to userspace. The remoteproc platform driver can choose
to collect a full/mini dump by specifying the coredump op.
