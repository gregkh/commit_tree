ASoC: sun8i-codec: Enable all supported clock inversions

When using the I2S, LEFT_J, or RIGHT_J format, the hardware supports
independent BCLK and LRCK inversion control. When using DSP_A or DSP_B,
LRCK inversion is not supported. The register bit is repurposed to
select between DSP_A and DSP_B. Extend the driver to support this.
