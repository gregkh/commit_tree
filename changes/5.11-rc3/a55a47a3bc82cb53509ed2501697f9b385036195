Revert "GFS2: Prevent delete work from occurring on glocks used for create"

Since commit a0e3cc65fa29 ("gfs2: Turn gl_delete into a delayed work"), we're
cancelling any pending delete work of an iopen glock before attaching a new
inode to that glock in gfs2_create_inode.  This means that delete_work_func can
no longer be queued or running when attaching the iopen glock to the new inode,
and we can revert commit a4923865ea07 ("GFS2: Prevent delete work from
occurring on glocks used for create"), which tried to achieve the same but in a
racy way.
