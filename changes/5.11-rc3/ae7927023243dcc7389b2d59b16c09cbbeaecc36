sched: Optimize finish_lock_switch()

The kernel test robot measured a -1.6% performance regression on
will-it-scale/sched_yield due to commit:

  2558aacff858 ("sched/hotplug: Ensure only per-cpu kthreads run during hotplug")

Even though we were careful to replace a single load with another
single load from the same cacheline.

Restore finish_lock_switch() to the exact state before the offending
patch and solve the problem differently.

Fixes: 2558aacff858 ("sched/hotplug: Ensure only per-cpu kthreads run during hotplug")
