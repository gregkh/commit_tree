ALSA: hda/hdmi: always print pin NIDs as hexadecimal

The debug prints from patch_hdmi.c are not aligned with HDA common code
in hda_codec.c nor with other HDA codec drivers.

To align with rest of the codebase, use hexadecimal formatting whenever
printing value of a HDA NID. Also refer to NIDs with capital letters in
traces as is done other modules. This presentation is also aligned with
the formatting used in HDA codec procfs entry.
