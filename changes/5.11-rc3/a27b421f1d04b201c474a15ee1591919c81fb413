ASoC: pcm: call snd_soc_dapm_stream_stop() in soc_pcm_hw_clean

Currently, the SND_SOC_DAPM_STREAM_START event is sent during
pcm_prepare() but the SND_SOC_DAPM_STREAM_STOP event is
sent only in dpcm_fe_dai_shutdown() after soc_pcm_close().
This results in an imbalance between when the DAPM widgets
receive the PRE/POST_PMU/PMD events. So call
snd_soc_dapm_stream_stop() in soc_pcm_hw_clean() before the
snd_soc_pcm_component_hw_free() to keep the stream_stop DAPM
event balanced with the stream_start event in soc_pm_prepare().

Also, in order to prevent duplicate DAPM stream events,
remove the call for DAPM STREAM_START event in dpcm_fe_dai_prepare()
and the call for DAPM STREAM_STOP event in dpcm_fe_dai_shutdown().
