net: dsa: tag_dsa: Allow forwarding of redirected IGMP traffic

When receiving an IGMP/MLD frame with a TO_CPU tag, the switch has not
performed any forwarding of it. This means that we should not set the
offload_fwd_mark on the skb, in case a software bridge wants it
forwarded.

This is a port of:

1ed9ec9b08ad ("dsa: Allow forwarding of redirected IGMP traffic")

Which corrected the issue for chips using EDSA tags, but not for those
using regular DSA tags.
