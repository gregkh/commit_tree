thermal: int340x: processor_thermal: Refactor MMIO interface

The Processor Thermal PCI device supports multiple features. Currently
we export only RAPL. But we need more features from this device exposed
for Tiger Lake and Alder Lake based platforms. So re-structure the
current MMIO interface, so that more features can be added cleanly.

No functional changes are expected with this change.

Changes done in this patch:
- Using PCI_DEVICE_DATA(), hence names of defines changed
- Move RAPL MMIO code to its own module
- Move the RAPL MMIO offsets to RAPL MMIO module
- Adjust Kconfig dependency of PROC_THERMAL_MMIO_RAPL
- Per processor driver data now contains the supported features
- Moved all the common data structures and defines to a common header
  file
- This new header file contains all the processor_thermal_* interfaces
- Based on the features supported the module interface is called
- Each module atleast provides one add and one remove function
