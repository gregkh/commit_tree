lib: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix multiple
warnings by explicitly adding multiple break statements instead of
letting the code fall through to the next case, and by replacing a
number of /* fall through */ comments with the new pseudo-keyword
macro fallthrough.

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* Fall through */ comments as
implicit fall-through markings.
