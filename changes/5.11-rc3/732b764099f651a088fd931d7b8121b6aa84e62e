crypto: sun8i-ce - fix two error path's memory leak

This patch fixes the following smatch warnings:
drivers/crypto/allwinner/sun8i-ce/sun8i-ce-hash.c:412
sun8i_ce_hash_run() warn: possible memory leak of 'result'
Note: "buf" is leaked as well.

Furthermore, in case of ENOMEM, crypto_finalize_hash_request() was not
called which was an error.
