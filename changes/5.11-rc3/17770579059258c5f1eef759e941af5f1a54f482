sched: Add WF_TTWU, WF_EXEC wakeup flags

To remove the sd_flag parameter of select_task_rq(), we need another way of
encoding wakeup types. There already is a WF_FORK flag, add the missing two.

With that said, we still need an easy way to turn WF_foo into
SD_bar (e.g. WF_TTWU into SD_BALANCE_WAKE). As suggested by Peter, let's
make our lives easier and make them match exactly, and throw in some
compile-time checks for good measure.
