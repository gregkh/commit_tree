torture: Periodically pause in stutter_wait()

Running locktorture scenario LOCK05 results in hangs:

tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/bin/kvm.sh --allcpus --torture lock --duration 3 --configs LOCK05

The lock_torture_writer() kthreads set themselves to MAX_NICE while
running SCHED_OTHER.  Other locktorture kthreads run at default niceness,
also SCHED_OTHER.  This results in these other locktorture kthreads
indefinitely preempting the lock_torture_writer() kthreads.  Note that
the cond_resched() in the stutter_wait() function's loop is ineffective
because this scenario is built with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y.

It is not clear that such indefinite preemption is supposed to happen, but
in the meantime this commit prevents kthreads running in stutter_wait()
from being completely CPU-bound, thus allowing the other threads to get
some CPU in a timely fashion.  This commit also uses hrtimers to provide
very short sleeps to avoid degrading the sudden-on testing that stutter
is supposed to provide.
