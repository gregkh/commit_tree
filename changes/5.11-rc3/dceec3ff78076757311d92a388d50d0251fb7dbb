arm64: expose FAR_EL1 tag bits in siginfo

The kernel currently clears the tag bits (i.e. bits 56-63) in the fault
address exposed via siginfo.si_addr and sigcontext.fault_address. However,
the tag bits may be needed by tools in order to accurately diagnose
memory errors, such as HWASan [1] or future tools based on the Memory
Tagging Extension (MTE).

Expose these bits via the arch_untagged_si_addr mechanism, so that
they are only exposed to signal handlers with the SA_EXPOSE_TAGBITS
flag set.
