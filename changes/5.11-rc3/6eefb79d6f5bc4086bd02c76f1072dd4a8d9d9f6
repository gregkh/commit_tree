pwm: sun4i: Remove erroneous else branch

Commit d3817a647059 ("pwm: sun4i: Remove redundant needs_delay") changed
the logic of an else branch so that the PWM_EN and PWM_CLK_GATING bits
are now cleared if the PWM is to be disabled, whereas previously the
condition was always false, and hence the branch never got executed.

This code is reported causing backlight issues on boards based on the
Allwinner A20 SoC. Fix this by removing the else branch, which restores
the behaviour prior to the offending commit.

Note that the PWM_EN and PWM_CLK_GATING bits still get cleared later in
sun4i_pwm_apply() if the PWM is to be disabled.
