net: qrtr: Unprepare MHI channels during remove

Reset MHI device channels when driver remove is called due to
module unload or any crash scenario. This will make sure that
MHI channels no longer remain enabled for transfers since the
MHI stack does not take care of this anymore after the auto-start
channels feature was removed.
