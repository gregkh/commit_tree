ASoC: sun8i-codec: Enable all supported PCM formats

Now that the DAI clock setup is correct for all hardware-supported PCM
formats, we can enable them in the driver. With the appropriate support
in the CPU DAI driver, this allows userspace to access the additional
formats.

Since this codec is connected to the CPU via a DAI, not directly, we do
not care if the CPU DAI is using 3-byte or 4-byte formats, so we can
support them both.
