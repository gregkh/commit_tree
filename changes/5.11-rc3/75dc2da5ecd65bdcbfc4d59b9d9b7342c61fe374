rcu-tasks: Make the units of ->init_fract be jiffies

Currently, the units of ->init_fract are milliseconds while those of
->gp_sleep are jiffies.  For consistency with each other and with the
argument of schedule_timeout_idle(), this commit changes the units of
->init_fract to jiffies.

This change does affect the backoff algorithm, but only on systems where
HZ is not 1000, and even there the change makes more sense, given that the
current setup would "back off" to the same number of jiffies repeatedly.
In contrast, with this change, the number of jiffies waited increases
on each pass through the loop in the rcu_tasks_wait_gp() function.
