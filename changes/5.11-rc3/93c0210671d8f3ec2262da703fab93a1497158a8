ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Fix lrck_period computation for I2S justified mode

Left and Right justified mode are computed using the same formula
as DSP_A and DSP_B mode.
Which is wrong and the user manual explicitly says:

LRCK_PERDIOD:
PCM Mode: Number of BCLKs within (Left + Right) channel width.
I2S/Left-Justified/Right-Justified Mode: Number of BCLKs within each
individual channel width(Left or Right)

Fix this by using the same formula as the I2S mode.
