arm64: Make cpu_logical_map() take unsigned int

CPU index should never be negative. Change the signature of
(set_)cpu_logical_map to take an unsigned int.

This still works even if the users treat the CPU index as an int,
and will allow the hypervisor's implementation to check that the index
is valid with a single upper-bound check.
