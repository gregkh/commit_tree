svcrdma: Use parsed chunk lists to detect reverse direction replies

Refactor: Don't duplicate header decoding smarts here. Instead, use
the new parsed chunk lists.

Note that the XID sanity test is also removed. The XID is already
looked up by the cb handler, and is rejected if it's not recognized.
