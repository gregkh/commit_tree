drm/amd/display: Update connector on DSC property change

[Why]
We want to trigger atomic check on connector when
DSC debugfs properties are changed. The previous
method was reverted because it accessed connector
properties unsafely and would also heavily
impact performance.

[How]
Add a flag for forcing DSC update in CRTC state
and add connector to the state if the flag is set.
