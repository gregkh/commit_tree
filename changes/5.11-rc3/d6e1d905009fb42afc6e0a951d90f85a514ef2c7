drm/radeon: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix multiple
warnings by explicitly adding multiple fallthrough pseudo-keyword macros,
as replacement for /* fall through */ comments.

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* fall through */ comments as
implicit fall-through markings.
