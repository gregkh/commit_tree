rtw88: coex: modified for BT info notify

Add counter to count BT info C2H command for debug usage.
It could present the C2H channel situation.

Fix BT IQK state decision condition for counting.
The original condition is wrong, it would cause coexistence mechanism
going to the wrong strategy.

New format supports getting TDMA parameter from WL firmware, since
coexistence needs current TDMA parameter to decide strategy.

Remove unnecessary operations about scoreboard, it is not a must for
current version.
