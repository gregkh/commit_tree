spmi: get rid of a warning when built with W=1

The SPMI core complaing with this warning when built with W=1:

	drivers/spmi/spmi.c: In function ‘spmi_controller_remove’:
	drivers/spmi/spmi.c:548:6: warning: variable ‘dummy’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
	  548 |  int dummy;
	      |      ^~~~~

As the dummy var isn't needed, remove it.
