ARM: dts: Configure interconnect target module for am3 wkup_m3

We can now probe devices with device tree only configuration using
ti-sysc interconnect target module driver.

Note that we no longer need ti,no-reset-on-init as the rstctrl resets
are properly handled by the reset driver and claimed by the RTC driver.
And we need to squash together the module ranges for driver compability.
