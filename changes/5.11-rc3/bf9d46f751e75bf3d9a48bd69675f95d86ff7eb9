media: platform: sti: c8sectpfe: core: Add of_node_put() at goto

Each iteration of for_each_child_of_node puts the previous node, but in
the case of a goto from the middle of the loop, there is no put, thus
causing a memory leak. Hence add a new label that puts the last used
node, and edit the goto statements in the middle of the loop to first go
to the new label.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
