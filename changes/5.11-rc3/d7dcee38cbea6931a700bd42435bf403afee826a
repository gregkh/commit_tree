staging: mt7621-pci: remove 'offset' with mem and io resource sizes

Offset contains resources size for both io and memory resources.
Those fields are directly initialized to zero and set up using
'pci_add_resource_offset' function. Instead of doing that remove
them and use directly function 'pci_add_resource' where zero is
passed directly to its internal call to 'pci_add_resource_offset'.
