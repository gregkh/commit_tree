fs-verity: rename fsverity_signed_digest to fsverity_formatted_digest

The name "struct fsverity_signed_digest" is causing confusion because it
isn't actually a signed digest, but rather it's the way that the digest
is formatted in order to be signed.  Rename it to
"struct fsverity_formatted_digest" to prevent this confusion.

Also update the struct's comment to clarify that it's specific to the
built-in signature verification support and isn't a requirement for all
fs-verity users.

I'll be renaming this struct in fsverity-utils too.
