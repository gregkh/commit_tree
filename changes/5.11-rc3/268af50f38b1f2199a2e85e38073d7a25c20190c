drm/panfrost: Support cache-coherent integrations

When the GPU's ACE-Lite interface is fully wired up and capable of
snooping CPU caches, it may be described as "dma-coherent" in
devicetree, which will already inform the DMA layer not to perform
unnecessary cache maintenance. However, we still need to ensure that
the GPU uses the appropriate cacheable outer-shareable attributes in
order to generate the requisite snoop signals, and that CPU mappings
don't create a mismatch by using a non-cacheable type either.
