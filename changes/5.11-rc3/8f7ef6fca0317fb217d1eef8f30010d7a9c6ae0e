ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix the condition passed to sof_dev_dbg_or_err

The condition boot_iteration == HDA_FW_BOOT_ATTEMPTS to determine
the log level for the DSP status dump would only work in the case of DSP
init failure after maximum number of attempts to initialize the DSP. If
DSP init succeeds in less than HDA_FW_BOOT_ATTEMPTS attempts and FW
loading fails, the ROM status dump would end up getting logged as debug
instead of an error.

So, add a new flag, SOF_DBG_DUMP_LOG_ERROR, to explicitly specify
the log level for DSP status dump.
