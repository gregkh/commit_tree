usbip: Remove in_interrupt() check

The usage of in_interrupt() in drivers is phased out and Linus clearly
requested that code which changes behaviour depending on context should
either be separated or the context be conveyed in an argument passed by the
caller, which usually knows the context.

usbip_recv() uses in_interrupt() to conditionally print context information
for debugging messages. The value is zero as the function is only called
from various *_rx_loop() kthread functions. Remove it.
