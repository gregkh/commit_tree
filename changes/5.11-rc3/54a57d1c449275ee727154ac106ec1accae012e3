dpaa2-eth: fix the size of the mapped SGT buffer

This patch fixes an error condition triggered when the code path which
transmits a S/G frame descriptor when the skb's headroom is not enough
for DPAA2's needs.

We are greated with a splat like the one below when a SGT structure is
recycled and that is because even though a dma_unmap is performed on the
Tx confirmation path, the unmap is not done with the proper size.

The dpaa2-eth driver uses an area of software annotations to transmit
necessary information from the Tx path to the Tx confirmation one. This
SWA structure has a different layout for each kind of frame that we are
dealing with: linear, S/G or XDP.

The commit referenced was incorrectly setting up the 'sgt_size' field
for the S/G type of SWA even though we are dealing with a linear skb
here.
