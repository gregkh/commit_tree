ide: remove BUG_ON(in_interrupt() || irqs_disabled()) from ide_unregister()

In the discussion about preempt count consistency across kernel
configurations:

 https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200914204209.256266093@linutronix.de/

it was concluded that the usage of in_interrupt() and related context
checks should be removed from non-core code.

Both BUG_ON()s in ide-probe.c were introduced in commit
   4015c949fb465 ("[PATCH] update ide core")

when ide_unregister() was extended with semaphore based locking.  Both
checks won't complain about disabled preemption which is also wrong.

The might_sleep() in today's mutex_lock() will complain about the
missuses.

Remove the BUG_ON() statements.
