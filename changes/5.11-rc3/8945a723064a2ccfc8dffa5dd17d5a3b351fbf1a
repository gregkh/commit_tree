mm/vmalloc: use free_vm_area() if an allocation fails

There is a dedicated and separate function that finds and removes a
continuous kernel virtual area.  As a final step it also releases the
"area", a descriptor of corresponding vm_struct.

Use free_vmap_area() in the __vmalloc_node_range() instead of open coded
steps which are exactly the same, to perform a cleanup.
