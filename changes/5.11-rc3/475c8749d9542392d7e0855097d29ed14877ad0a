powerpc/book3s64/kuap: Improve error reporting with KUAP

This partially reverts commit eb232b162446 ("powerpc/book3s64/kuap: Improve
error reporting with KUAP") and update the fault handler to print

[   55.022514] Kernel attempted to access user page (7e6725b70000) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)
[   55.022528] BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on read at 0x7e6725b70000
[   55.022533] Faulting instruction address: 0xc000000000e8b9bc
[   55.022540] Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]
....

when the kernel access userspace address without unlocking AMR.

bad_kuap_fault() is added as part of commit 5e5be3aed230 ("powerpc/mm: Detect
bad KUAP faults") to catch userspace access incorrectly blocked by AMR. Hence
retain the full stack dump there even with hash translation. Also, add a comment
explaining the difference between hash and radix.
