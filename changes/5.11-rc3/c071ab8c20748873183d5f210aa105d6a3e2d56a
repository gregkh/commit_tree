drm/i915/gem: Avoid synchronous binds deep within locks

On bxt, we require a VT'd w/a to serialise all GGTT updates with memory
transfers, and use stop_machine() for this purpose. stop_machine() is a
global serialisation barrier and so dangerous to use from within
critical sections, as the stop_machine() will wait for all cpus to enter
the stop_machine callback, and those cpus may be waiting for the
critical section already held.
