ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: define parse_platform_ext_manifest op

Define the parse_platform_ext_manifest() op for HDA platforms to parse
the SOF_EXT_MAN_CAVS_CONFIG_CAVS_LPRO config item to determine if the FW
is configured for LPRO. The default clock configuration is assumed to be
HPRO in the absence of this item in the extended manifest.
New member clk_config_lpro is added to struct sof_intel_hda_dev to store
the FW clock config information and that this will be used later to perform
platform-specific operations in the post_fw_run op.
