nexthop: Emit a notification when a nexthop is added

Emit a notification in the nexthop notification chain when a new nexthop
is added (not replaced). The nexthop can either be a new group or a
single nexthop.

The notification is sent after the nexthop is inserted into the
red-black tree, as listeners might need to callback into the nexthop
code with the nexthop ID in order to mark the nexthop as offloaded.

A 'REPLACE' notification is emitted instead of 'ADD' as the distinction
between the two is not important for in-kernel listeners. In case the
listener is not familiar with the encoded nexthop ID, it can simply
treat it as a new one. This is also consistent with the route offload
API.
