scsi: ufs: Allow an error return value from ->device_reset()

It is simpler for drivers to provide a ->device_reset() callback
irrespective of whether the GPIO, or firmware interface necessary to do the
reset, is discovered during probe.

Change ->device_reset() to return an error code.  Drivers that provide the
callback, but do not do the reset operation should return -EOPNOTSUPP.
