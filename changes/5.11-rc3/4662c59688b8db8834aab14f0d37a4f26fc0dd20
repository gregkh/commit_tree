ASoC: soc-pcm: add soc_pcm_hw_clean() and call it from soc_pcm_hw_params/free()

soc_pcm_hw_params() does rollback when failed (A),
but, it is almost same as soc_pcm_hw_free().

	static int soc_pcm_hw_params(xxx)
	{
		...
		if (ret < 0)
			goto xxx_err;
		...
		return ret;

 ^	component_err:
 |		...
 |	interface_err:
(A)		...
 |	codec_err:
 |		...
 v		return ret;
	}

The difference is
soc_pcm_hw_free() is for all dai/component/substream,
rollback          is for succeeded part only.

This kind of duplicated code can be a hotbed of bugs,
thus, we want to share soc_pcm_hw_free() and rollback.

Now, soc_pcm_hw_params/free() are handling
	1) snd_soc_link_hw_params/free()
	2) snd_soc_pcm_component_hw_params/free()
	3) snd_soc_dai_hw_params/free()

Now, 1) to 3) are handled.
This patch adds new soc_pcm_hw_clean() and call it from
soc_pcm_hw_params() as rollback, and from soc_pcm_hw_free() as
normal close handler.

Other difference is that soc_pcm_hw_free() handles digital mute
if it was last user. Rollback also handles it by this patch.
