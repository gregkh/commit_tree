drm/i915: Simplify the link training functions

Split the prepare, link training, fallback-handling steps into their own
functions for clarity and as a preparation for the upcoming LTTPR
changes.

While at it also:
- Unexport and inline intel_dp_set_idle_link_train(), which is used at a
  single place.
- Add some documentation to functions that are exported or that can use
  a better description about which part of the LT sequence they
  implement.

v2: (Ville)
- Unexport/inline intel_dp_set_idle_link_train()
- Make the documentation of
  intel_dp_prepare_link_train()/intel_dp_stop_link_train() more accurate
  wrt. HW specific details.
