um: tty: Fix handling of close in tty lines

Fix a logical error in tty reading. We get 0 and errno == EAGAIN
on the first attempt to read from a closed file descriptor.

Compared to that a true EAGAIN is EAGAIN and -1.

If we check errno for EAGAIN first, before checking the return
value we miss the fact that the descriptor is closed.

This bug is as old as the driver. It was not showing up with
the original POLL based IRQ controller, because it was
producing multiple events. Switching to EPOLL unmasked it.
