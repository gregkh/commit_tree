PCI: Unify ECAM constants in native PCI Express drivers

Add ECAM-related constants to provide a set of standard constants
defining memory address shift values to the byte-level address that can
be used to access the PCI Express Configuration Space, and then move
native PCI Express controller drivers to use the newly introduced
definitions retiring driver-specific ones.

Refactor pci_ecam_map_bus() function to use newly added constants so
that limits to the bus, device function and offset (now limited to 4K as
per the specification) are in place to prevent the defective or
malicious caller from supplying incorrect configuration offset and thus
targeting the wrong device when accessing extended configuration space.

This refactor also allows for the ".bus_shift" initialisers to be
dropped when the user is not using a custom value as a default value
will be used as per the PCI Express Specification.

Thanks to Qian Cai <qcai@redhat.com>, Michael Walle <michael@walle.cc>,
and Vladimir Oltean <olteanv@gmail.com> for reporting a pci_ecam_create()
issue with .bus_shift and to Vladimir for proposing the fix.
