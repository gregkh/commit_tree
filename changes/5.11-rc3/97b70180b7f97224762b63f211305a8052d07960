crypto: aegis128/neon - move final tag check to SIMD domain

Instead of calculating the tag and returning it to the caller on
decryption, use a SIMD compare and min across vector to perform
the comparison. This is slightly more efficient, and removes the
need on the caller's part to wipe the tag from memory if the
decryption failed.

While at it, switch to unsigned int when passing cryptlen and
assoclen - we don't support input sizes where it matters anyway.
