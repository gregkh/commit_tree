selftests/core: fix close_range_test build after XFAIL removal

XFAIL was removed in commit 9847d24af95c ("selftests/harness: Refactor
XFAIL into SKIP") and its use in close_range_test was already replaced
by commit 1d44d0dd61b6 ("selftests: core: use SKIP instead of XFAIL in
close_range_test.c"). However, commit 23afeaeff3d9 ("selftests: core:
add tests for CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC") introduced usage of XFAIL in
TEST(close_range_cloexec). Use SKIP there as well.

Fixes: 23afeaeff3d9 ("selftests: core: add tests for CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC")
