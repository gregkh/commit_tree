Revert "nfsd4: support change_attr_type attribute"

This reverts commit a85857633b04d57f4524cca0a2bfaf87b2543f9f.

We're still factoring ctime into our change attribute even in the
IS_I_VERSION case.  If someone sets the system time backwards, a client
could see the change attribute go backwards.  Maybe we can just say
"well, don't do that", but there's some question whether that's good
enough, or whether we need a better guarantee.

Also, the client still isn't actually using the attribute.

While we're still figuring this out, let's just stop returning this
attribute.
