io_uring: allow non-fixed files with SQPOLL

The restriction of needing fixed files for SQPOLL is problematic, and
prevents/inhibits several valid uses cases. With the referenced
files_struct that we have now, it's trivially supportable.

Treat ->files like we do the mm for the SQPOLL thread - grab a reference
to it (and assign it), and drop it when we're done.

This feature is exposed as IORING_FEAT_SQPOLL_NONFIXED.
