drm/amd/pm: Replace one-element array with flexible-array in struct phm_uvd_clock_voltage_dependency_table

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code according to the use of a flexible-array member in
struct phm_uvd_clock_voltage_dependency_table, instead of a one-element
array, and use the struct_size() helper to calculate the size for the
allocation.

Also, save some heap space as the original code is multiplying
table->numEntries by sizeof(struct phm_uvd_clock_voltage_dependency_table)
when it should have multiplied it by sizeof(phm_uvd_clock_voltage_dependency_record)
instead.
