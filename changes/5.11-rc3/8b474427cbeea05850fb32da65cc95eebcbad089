KVM: x86: use kvm_complete_insn_gp in emulating RDMSR/WRMSR

Simplify the four functions that handle {kernel,user} {rd,wr}msr, there
is still some repetition between the two instances of rdmsr but the
whole business of calling kvm_inject_gp and kvm_skip_emulated_instruction
can be unified nicely.

Because complete_emulated_wrmsr now becomes essentially a call to
kvm_complete_insn_gp, remove complete_emulated_msr.
