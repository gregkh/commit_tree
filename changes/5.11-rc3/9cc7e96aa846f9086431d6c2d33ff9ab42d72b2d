mm/page_owner: record timestamp and pid

Collect the time for each allocation recorded in page owner so that
allocation "surges" can be measured.

Record the pid for each allocation recorded in page owner so that the
source of allocation "surges" can be better identified.

The above is very useful when doing memory analysis.  On a crash for
example, we can get this information from kdump (or ramdump) and parse it
to figure out memory allocation problems.

Please note that on x86_64 this increases the size of struct page_owner
from 16 bytes to 32.

Vlastimil: it's not a functionality intended for production, so unless
somebody says they need to enable page_owner for debugging and this
increase prevents them from fitting into available memory, let's not
complicate things with making this optional.
