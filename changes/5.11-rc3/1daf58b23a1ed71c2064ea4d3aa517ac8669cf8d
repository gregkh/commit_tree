ath11k: Ignore resetting peer auth flag in peer assoc cmd

Incase of hardware encryption, WMI_PEER_AUTH flag will be set by firmware
during install key. Since install key wont be done for software encryption
mode, firmware will not set this flag. Due to this, seeing traffic failure
in software encryption. Hence, avoid resetting peer auth flag if hardware
encryption disabled.
