scsi: ufs: Fix clkgating on/off

The following call stack prevents clk_gating at every I/O completion.  We
can remove the condition, ufshcd_any_tag_in_use(), since clkgating_work
will check it again.

ufshcd_complete_requests(struct ufs_hba *hba)
  ufshcd_transfer_req_compl()
    __ufshcd_transfer_req_compl()
      __ufshcd_release(hba)
        if (ufshcd_any_tag_in_use() == 1)
           return;
  ufshcd_tmc_handler(hba);
    blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter();

Note that this still requires work to deal with a potential race condition
when user sets clkgating.delay_ms to very small value. That can cause
preventing clkgating by the check of ufshcd_any_tag_in_use() in gate_work.
