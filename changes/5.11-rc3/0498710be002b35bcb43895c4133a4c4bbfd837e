platform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: Relocate set_port_params_v*() functions

Move the cros_typec_set_port_params_v0/v1() functions closer to the
place where they are called, cros_typec_port_update().

While we are performing the relocation, also move cros_typec_get_mux_info()
closer to its call-site.

No functional changes are introduced by this commit.
