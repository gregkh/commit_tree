drm: Introduce plane and CRTC scaling filter properties

Introduce per-plane and per-CRTC scaling filter properties to allow
userspace to select the driver's default scaling filter or
Nearest-neighbor(NN) filter for upscaling operations on CRTC and
plane.

Drivers can set up this property for a plane by calling
drm_plane_create_scaling_filter() and for a CRTC by calling
drm_crtc_create_scaling_filter().

NN filter works by filling in the missing color values in the upscaled
image with that of the coordinate-mapped nearest source pixel value.

NN filter for integer multiple scaling can be particularly useful for
for pixel art games that rely on sharp, blocky images to deliver their
distinctive look.
