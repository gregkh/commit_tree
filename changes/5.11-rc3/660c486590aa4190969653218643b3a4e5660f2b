PCI: dwc: Set 32-bit DMA mask for MSI target address allocation

Set DMA mask to 32-bit while allocating the MSI target address so that
the address is usable for both 32-bit and 64-bit MSI capable devices.
Throw a warning if it fails to set the mask to 32-bit to alert that
devices that are only 32-bit MSI capable may not work properly.
