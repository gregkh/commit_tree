drm: document that user-space should avoid parsing EDIDs

User-space should avoid parsing EDIDs for metadata already exposed via
other KMS interfaces and properties. For instance, user-space should not
try to extract a list of modes from the EDID: the kernel might mutate
the mode list (because of link capabilities or quirks for instance).

Other metadata not exposed by KMS can be parsed by user-space. This
includes for instance monitor identification (make/model/serial) and
supported color-spaces.
