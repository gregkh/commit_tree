hwmon: (ina3221) Fix PM usage counter unbalance in ina3221_write_enable

pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter
even it failed. Forgetting to putting operation will
result in reference leak here. We fix it by replacing
it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage counter
balanced. It depends on the mainline commit[PM: runtime:
Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usagecounter].
