pstore: Move kmsg_bytes default into Kconfig

While kmsg_bytes can be set for pstore via mount, if a crash occurs
before the mount only partial console log will be stored as kmsg_bytes
defaults to a potentially different hardcoded value in the kernel
(PSTORE_DEFAULT_KMSG_BYTES). This makes it impossible to analyze valuable
post-mortem data especially on the embedded development or in the process
of bringing up new boards. Change this value to be a Kconfig option
with the default of old PSTORE_DEFAULT_KMSG_BYTES
