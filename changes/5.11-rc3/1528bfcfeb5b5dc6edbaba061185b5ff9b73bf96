drm/vc4: replace idr_init() by idr_init_base()

idr_init() uses base 0 which is an invalid identifier for this driver.
The idr_alloc for this driver uses VC4_PERFMONID_MIN as start value for
ID range and it is #defined to 1. The new function idr_init_base allows
IDR to set the ID lookup from base 1. This avoids all lookups that
otherwise starts from 0 since 0 is always unused / available.
