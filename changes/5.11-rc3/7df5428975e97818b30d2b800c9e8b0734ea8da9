drm/selftests/test-drm_mm: Mark 'hole_end' as always_unused

In the macro drm_mm_for_each_hole() 'hole_end' is provided as a
container for 'hole_start + pos->hole_size', but is not utilised in
this use-case.  We cannot simply delete the variable, so here we tell
the compiler that we're intentionally discarding the read value.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/gpu/drm/selftests/test-drm_mm.c: In function ‘assert_no_holes’:
 drivers/gpu/drm/selftests/test-drm_mm.c:57:18: warning: variable ‘hole_end’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
