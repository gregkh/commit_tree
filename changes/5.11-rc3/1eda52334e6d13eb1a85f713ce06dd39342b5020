hwmon: (pwm-fan) Ensure that calculation doesn't discard big period values

With MAX_PWM being defined to 255 the code

	unsigned long period;
	...
	period = ctx->pwm->args.period;
	state.duty_cycle = DIV_ROUND_UP(pwm * (period - 1), MAX_PWM);

calculates a too small value for duty_cycle if the configured period is
big (either by discarding the 64 bit value ctx->pwm->args.period or by
overflowing the multiplication). As this results in a too slow fan and
so maybe an overheating machine better be safe than sorry and error out
in .probe.
