net: stmmac: Use hrtimer for TX coalescing

This driver uses a normal timer for TX coalescing, which means that the
with the default tx-usecs of 1000 microseconds the cleanups actually
happen 10 ms or more later with HZ=100.  This leads to very low
througput with TCP when bridged to a slow link such as a 4G modem.  Fix
this by using an hrtimer instead.

On my ARM platform with HZ=100 and the default TX coalescing settings
(tx-frames 25 tx-usecs 1000), with "tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem
delay 60ms 40ms rate 50Mbit" run on the server, netperf's TCP_STREAM
improves from ~5.5 Mbps to ~100 Mbps.
