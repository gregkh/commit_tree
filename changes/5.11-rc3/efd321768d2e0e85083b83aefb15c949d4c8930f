scsi: zfcp: Clarify & assert the stat_lock locking in zfcp_qdio_send()

Explain why the plain spin_lock() suffices in current code, even when the
stat_lock is also used by zfcp_qdio_int_req() in tasklet context.

We could also promote the spin_lock() to a spin_lock_irqsave(), but that
would just obfuscate the locking even further.
