KVM: x86: Return bool instead of int for CR4 and SREGS validity checks

Rework the common CR4 and SREGS checks to return a bool instead of an
int, i.e. true/false instead of 0/-EINVAL, and add "is" to the name to
clarify the polarity of the return value (which is effectively inverted
by this change).

No functional changed intended.
