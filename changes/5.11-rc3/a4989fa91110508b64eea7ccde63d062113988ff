net/lapb: support netdev events

This patch allows layer2 (LAPB) to react to netdev events itself and
avoids the detour via layer3 (X.25).

1. Establish layer2 on NETDEV_UP events, if the carrier is already up.

2. Call lapb_disconnect_request() on NETDEV_GOING_DOWN events to signal
   the peer that the connection will go down.
   (Only when the carrier is up.)

3. When a NETDEV_DOWN event occur, clear all queues, enter state
   LAPB_STATE_0 and stop all timers.

4. The NETDEV_CHANGE event makes it possible to handle carrier loss and
   detection.

   In case of Carrier Loss, clear all queues, enter state LAPB_STATE_0
   and stop all timers.

   In case of Carrier Detection, we start timer t1 on a DCE interface,
   and on a DTE interface we change to state LAPB_STATE_1 and start
   sending SABM(E).
