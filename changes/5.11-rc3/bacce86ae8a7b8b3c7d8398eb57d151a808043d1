btrfs: drop unused argument step from btrfs_free_extra_devids

Commit cf89af146b7e ("btrfs: dev-replace: fail mount if we don't have
replace item with target device") dropped the multi stage operation of
btrfs_free_extra_devids() that does not need to check replace target
anymore and we can remove the 'step' argument.
