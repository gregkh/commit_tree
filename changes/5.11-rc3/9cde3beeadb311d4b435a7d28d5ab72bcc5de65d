bpf: Add tests for task_local_storage

The test exercises the syscall based map operations by creating a pidfd
for the current process.

For verifying kernel / LSM functionality, the test implements a simple
MAC policy which denies an executable from unlinking itself. The LSM
program bprm_committed_creds sets a task_local_storage with a pointer to
the inode. This is then used to detect if the task is trying to unlink
itself in the inode_unlink LSM hook.

The test copies /bin/rm to /tmp and executes it in a child thread with
the intention of deleting itself. A successful test should prevent the
the running executable from deleting itself.

The bpf programs are also updated to call bpf_spin_{lock, unlock} to
trigger the verfier checks for spin locks.

The temporary file is cleaned up later in the test.
