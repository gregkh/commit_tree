ice: don't always return an error for Get PHY Abilities AQ command

There are times when the driver shouldn't return an error when the Get
PHY abilities AQ command (0x0600) returns an error. Instead the driver
should log that the error occurred and continue on. This allows the
driver to load even though the AQ command failed. The user can then
later determine the reason for the failure and correct it.
