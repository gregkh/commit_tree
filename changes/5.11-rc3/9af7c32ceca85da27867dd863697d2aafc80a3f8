ath10k: add target IRAM recovery feature support

This target IRAM recovery feature support is to copy target
IRAM contents available at ATH10K_MEM_REGION_TYPE_REG to host
memory for back up after firmware loaded. Target IRAM contents
are copied to wmi memory chunks allocated for the
WMI_IRAM_RECOVERY_HOST_MEM_REQ_ID and provide the wmi chunks
address to the firmware through wmi init command.

If firmware detects andy IRAM corruption through periodic
checksum validation, It will download the IRAM contents back
from the provided wmi memory chunks address using hif_memcpy.

This IRAM recovery feature prevent target assert in case of
unexpected target IRAM corruptions.

This patch also introduce a new feature flag 'iram-recovery' for
backward compatibility.
