gve: Add support for raw addressing in the tx path

During TX, skbs' data addresses are dma_map'ed and passed to the NIC.
This means that the device can perform DMA directly from these addresses
and the driver does not have to copy the buffer content into
pre-allocated buffers/qpls (as in qpl mode).
