net: mlx5: Replace in_irq() usage

mlx5_eq_async_int() uses in_irq() to decide whether eq::lock needs to be
acquired and released with spin_[un]lock() or the irq saving/restoring
variants.

The usage of in_*() in drivers is phased out and Linus clearly requested
that code which changes behaviour depending on context should either be
seperated or the context be conveyed in an argument passed by the caller,
which usually knows the context.

mlx5_eq_async_int() knows the context via the action argument already so
using it for the lock variant decision is a straight forward replacement
for in_irq().
