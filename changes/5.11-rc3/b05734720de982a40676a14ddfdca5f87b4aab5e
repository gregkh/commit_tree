drm/i915/gt: Retire cancelled requests on unload

If we manage to hit the intel_gt_set_wedged_on_fini() while active, i.e.
module unload during a stress test, we may cancel the requests but not
clean up. This leads to a very slow module unload as we wait for
something or other to trigger the retirement flushing, or timeout and
unload with a bunch of warnings. Instead if we explicitly cancel then
cleanup on an active unload, it should be instant and quiet.
