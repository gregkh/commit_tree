Currently we don't have a reproducer yet, but seems that there is a
race in current codes:
=> io_put_sq_data
      ctx_list is empty now.       |
==> kthread_park(sqd->thread);     |
                                   | T1: sq thread is parked now.
==> kthread_stop(sqd->thread);     |
    KTHREAD_SHOULD_STOP is set now.|
===> kthread_unpark(k);            |
                                   | T2: sq thread is now unparkd, run again.
                                   |
                                   | T3: sq thread is now preempted out.
                                   |
===> wake_up_process(k);           |
                                   |
                                   | T4: Since sqd ctx_list is empty, needs_sched will be true,
                                   | then sq thread sets task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE,
                                   | and schedule, now sq thread will never be waken up.
===> wait_for_completion           |

I have artificially used mdelay() to simulate above race, will get same
stack like this syzbot report, but to be honest, I'm not sure this code
race triggers syzbot report.

To fix this possible code race, when sq thread is unparked, need to check
whether sq thread has been stopped.
