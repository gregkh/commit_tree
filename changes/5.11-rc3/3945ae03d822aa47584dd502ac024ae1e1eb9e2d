xfs: move kernel-specific superblock validation out of libxfs

A couple of the superblock validation checks apply only to the kernel,
so move them to xfs_fc_fill_super before we add the needsrepair "feature",
which will prevent the kernel (but not xfsprogs) from mounting the
filesystem.  This also reduces the diff between kernel and userspace
libxfs.
