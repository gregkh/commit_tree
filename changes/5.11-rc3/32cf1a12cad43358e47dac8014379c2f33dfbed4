ACPICA: Interpreter: fix memory leak by using existing buffer

ACPICA commit 52d1da5dcbd79a722b70f02a1a83f04088f51ff6

There was a memory leak that ocurred when a _CID object is defined as
a package containing string objects. When _CID is checked for any
possible repairs, it calls a helper function to repair _HID (because
_CID basically contains multiple _HID entries).

The _HID repair function assumes that string objects are standalone
objects that are not contained inside of any packages. The _HID
repair function replaces the string object with a brand new object
and attempts to delete the old object by decrementing the reference
count of the old object. Strings inside of packages have a reference
count of 2 so the _HID repair function leaves this object in a
dangling state and causes a memory leak.

Instead of allocating a brand new object and removing the old object,
use the existing object when repairing the _HID object.
