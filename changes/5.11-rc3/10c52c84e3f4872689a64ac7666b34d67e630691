fuse: rename FUSE_WRITE_KILL_PRIV to FUSE_WRITE_KILL_SUIDGID

Kernel has:
ATTR_KILL_PRIV -> clear "security.capability"
ATTR_KILL_SUID -> clear S_ISUID
ATTR_KILL_SGID -> clear S_ISGID if executable

Fuse has:
FUSE_WRITE_KILL_PRIV -> clear S_ISUID and S_ISGID if executable

So FUSE_WRITE_KILL_PRIV implies the complement of ATTR_KILL_PRIV, which is
somewhat confusing.  Also PRIV implies all privileges, including
"security.capability".

Change the name to FUSE_WRITE_KILL_SUIDGID and make FUSE_WRITE_KILL_PRIV an
alias to perserve API compatibility
