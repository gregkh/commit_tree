powerpc/mm: sanity_check_fault() should work for all, not only BOOK3S

The verification and message introduced by commit 374f3f5979f9
("powerpc/mm/hash: Handle user access of kernel address gracefully")
applies to all platforms, it should not be limited to BOOK3S.

Make the BOOK3S version of sanity_check_fault() the one for all,
and bail out earlier if not BOOK3S.
