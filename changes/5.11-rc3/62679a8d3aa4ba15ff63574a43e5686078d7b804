net: evaluate net.ipvX.conf.all.disable_policy and disable_xfrm

The disable_policy and disable_xfrm are a per-interface sysctl to
disable IPsec policy or encryption on an interface. However, while a
"all" variant is exposed, it was a noop since it was never evaluated.
We use the usual "or" logic for this kind of sysctls.
