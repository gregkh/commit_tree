lib/stackdepot.c: use flex_array_size() helper in memcpy()

Make use of the flex_array_size() helper to calculate the size of a
flexible array member within an enclosing structure.

This helper offers defense-in-depth against potential integer overflows,
while at the same time makes it explicitly clear that we are dealing with
a flexible array member.
