KVM: arm64: Delay the polling of the GICR_VPENDBASER.Dirty bit

In order to reduce the impact of the VPT parsing happening on the GIC,
we can split the vcpu reseidency in two phases:

- programming GICR_VPENDBASER: this still happens in vcpu_load()
- checking for the VPT parsing to be complete: this can happen
  on vcpu entry (in kvm_vgic_flush_hwstate())

This allows the GIC and the CPU to work in parallel, rewmoving some
of the entry overhead.
