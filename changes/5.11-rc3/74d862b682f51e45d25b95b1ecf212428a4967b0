sched: Make migrate_disable/enable() independent of RT

Now that the scheduler can deal with migrate disable properly, there is no
real compelling reason to make it only available for RT.

There are quite some code pathes which needlessly disable preemption in
order to prevent migration and some constructs like kmap_atomic() enforce
it implicitly.

Making it available independent of RT allows to provide a preemptible
variant of kmap_atomic() and makes the code more consistent in general.
