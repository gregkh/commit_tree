arm64: uaccess: simplify __copy_user_flushcache()

Currently __copy_user_flushcache() open-codes raw_copy_from_user(), and
doesn't use uaccess_mask_ptr() on the user address. Let's have it call
raw_copy_from_user(), which is both a simplification and ensures that
user pointers are masked under speculation.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
