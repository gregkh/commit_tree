thunderbolt: Pass TX and RX data directly to usb4_switch_op()

We are going to make usb4_switch_op() to match better the corresponding
firmware (ICM) USB4 router operation proxy interface, so that we can use
either based on the connection manager implementation.

For this reason rename usb4_switch_op() to __usb4_switch_op() that
provides the most complete interface. Then make usb4_switch_op() and
usb4_switch_op_data() call it with correct set of parameters and update
the callers accordingly.
