s390/trng: set quality to 1024

The s390-trng does provide 100% entropy. The quality value is supported
to be between 1 and 1024 and not 1..1000.  Use 1024 to make this driver
the preferred one. If we ever have a better driver that has the same
quality but is faster we can change this again when merging the new
driver. No need to be conservative.

This makes sure that the hw variant is preferred over things like
virtio-rng, where the hypervisor has a potential to be misconfigured
and thus should have a slightly lower confidence.
