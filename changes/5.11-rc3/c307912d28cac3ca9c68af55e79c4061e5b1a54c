dt-bindings: i3c: MIPI I3C Host Controller Interface

The MIPI I3C HCI (Host Controller Interface) specification defines
a common software driver interface to support compliant MIPI I3C
host controller hardware implementations from multiple vendors.

All that is needed is an I/O area and an interrupt signal;. The hardware
is self-advertising wrt its implementor and implemented capabilities so
there is currently no details that the driver can't figure out on its own.
