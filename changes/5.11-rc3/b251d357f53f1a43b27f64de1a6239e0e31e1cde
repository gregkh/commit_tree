drm/amd/pm: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix a couple
of warnings by explicitly adding a break statement instead of letting
the code fall through to the next case, and a fallthrough pseudo-keyword
as a replacement for a /* fall through */ comment,

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* fall through */ comments as
implicit fall-through markings.
