drm/aspeed: Add sysfs for output settings

These settings are used by an ASPEED BMC to determine when the host is
trying to drive the display over PCIe (vga_pw) and to switch the
output between PCIe and the internal graphics device (dac_mux).

The valid values for the dac mux are:

 00: VGA mode (default, aka PCIe)
 01: Graphics CRT (aka BMC internal graphics, this driver)
 10: Pass through mode from video input port A
 11: Pass through mode from video input port B

Values for the read-only vga password register are:

 1: Host driving the display
 0: Host not driving the display
