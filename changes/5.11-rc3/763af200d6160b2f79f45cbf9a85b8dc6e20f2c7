samples: bpf: Refactor ibumad program with libbpf

This commit refactors the existing ibumad program with libbpf bpf
loader. Attach/detach of Tracepoint bpf programs has been managed
with the generic bpf_program__attach() and bpf_link__destroy() from
the libbpf.

Also, instead of using the previous BPF MAP definition, this commit
refactors ibumad MAP definition with the new BTF-defined MAP format.

To verify that this bpf program works without an infiniband device,
try loading ib_umad kernel module and test the program as follows:

    # modprobe ib_umad
    # ./ibumad

Moreover, TRACE_HELPERS has been removed from the Makefile since it is
not used on this program.
