media: Bulk remove BUG_ON(in_interrupt())

None of these BUG_ON()'s is justified. BUG_ON() should only be used when
there is really no way to survive.

If at all these could be replaced by lockdep_assert_preemption_enabled() to
cover all invalid caller context and not just those covered by
in_interrupt().

But all functions which are invoked from those places contain already debug
mechanisms to catch wrong context, so having these extra checks is not
having any advantage.
