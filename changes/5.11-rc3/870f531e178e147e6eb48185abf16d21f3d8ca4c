r8169: set IRQF_NO_THREAD if MSI(X) is enabled

We had to remove flag IRQF_NO_THREAD because it conflicts with shared
interrupts in case legacy interrupts are used. Following up on the
linked discussion set IRQF_NO_THREAD if MSI or MSI-X is used, because
both guarantee that interrupt won't be shared.
