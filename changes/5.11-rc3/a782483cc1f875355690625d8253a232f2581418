block: remove the nr_sects field in struct hd_struct

Now that the hd_struct always has a block device attached to it, there is
no need for having two size field that just get out of sync.

Additionally the field in hd_struct did not use proper serialization,
possibly allowing for torn writes.  By only using the block_device field
this problem also gets fixed.
