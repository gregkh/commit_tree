drm/i915/gt: Always send a pulse down the engine after disabling heartbeat

Currently, we check we can send a pulse prior to disabling the
heartbeat to verify that we can change the heartbeat, but since we may
re-evaluate execution upon changing the heartbeat interval we need another
pulse afterwards to refresh execution.

v2: Tvrtko asked if we could reduce the double pulse to a single, which
opened up a discussion of how we should handle the pulse-error after
attempting to change the property, and the desire to serialise
adjustment of the property with its validating pulse, and unwind upon
failure.
