usb: gadget: udc: Remove in_interrupt()/in_irq() from comments

The usage of in_irq()/in_interrupt() in drivers is phased out for various
reasons.

The context description for usb_gadget_giveback_request() is misleading as
in_interupt() means: hard interrupt or soft interrupt or bottom half
disabled regions. But it's also invoked from task context when endpoints
are torn down. Remove it as it's more confusing than helpful.

Replace also the in_irq() comment with plain text.
