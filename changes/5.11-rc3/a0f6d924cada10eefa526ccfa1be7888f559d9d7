btrfs: remove stub device info from messages when we have no fs_info

Without a NULL fs_info the helpers will print something like

	BTRFS error (device <unknown>): ...

This can happen in contexts where fs_info is not available at all or
it's potentially unsafe due to object lifetime. The <unknown> stub does
not bring much information and with the prefix makes the message
unnecessarily longer.

Remove it for the NULL fs_info case.

	BTRFS error: ...

Callers can add the device information to the message itself if needed.
