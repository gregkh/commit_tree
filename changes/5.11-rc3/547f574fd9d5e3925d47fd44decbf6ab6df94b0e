docs: Update documentation to reflect what TAINT_CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC means

Here's a patch updating the meaning of TAINT_CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC after
Borislav introduced changes in a7e1f67ed29f and upcoming patches in tip.

TAINT_CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC now means a bit more what it implies as the
flag isn't set just because of a CPU misconfiguration or mismatch.
Historically it was for SMP kernel oops on an officially SMP incapable
processor but now it also covers CPUs whose MSRs have been incorrectly
poked at from userspace, drivers being used on non supported
architectures, broken firmware, mismatched CPUs, ...

Update documentation and script to reflect that.
