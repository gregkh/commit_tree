can: m_can: use struct m_can_classdev as drvdata

The m_can driver's suspend and resume functions (m_can_class_suspend() and
m_can_class_resume()) make use of dev_get_drvdata() and assume that the drvdata
is a pointer to the struct net_device.

With upcoming conversion of the tcan4x5x driver to pm_runtime this assumption
is no longer valid. As the suspend and resume functions actually need a struct
m_can_classdev pointer, change the m_can_platform and the m_can_pci driver to
hold a pointer to struct m_can_classdev instead, as the tcan4x5x driver already
does.
