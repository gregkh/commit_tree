misc: pci_endpoint_test: Remove unnecessary verification

The first condition of the if statement can never be true, because
bar variable is an enum variable type defined between 0 and 5, and
also bar variable acquires the value from arg function parameter which
is an unsigned long variable.

The constant 5 was replaced the the equivalent enum type, in this case
BAR_5.
