mtd: phram: Allow the user to set the erase page size.

Permit the user to specify the erase page size as a parameter.
This solves two problems:

- phram can access images made by mkfs.jffs2.  mkfs.jffs2 won't
create images with erase sizes less than 8KiB; many architectures
define PAGE_SIZE as 4KiB.

- Allows more effective use of small capacity devices.  JFFS2
needs somewhere between 2 and 5 empty pages for garbage collection;
and for an NVRAM part with only 32KiB of space, a smaller erase page
allows much better utilization in applications where garbage collection
is important.
