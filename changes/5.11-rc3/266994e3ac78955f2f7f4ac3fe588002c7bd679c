m68k: mac: Refactor iop_preinit() and iop_init()

The idea behind iop_preinit() was to put the SCC IOP into bypass mode.
However, that remains unimplemented and implementing it would be
difficult. Let the comments and code reflect this. Even if iop_preinit()
worked as described in the comments, it gets called immediately before
iop_init() so it might as well part of iop_init().
