media: i2c: fix an uninitialized error code

Clang points out that the error handling in ov02a10_s_stream() is
broken, and just returns a random error code:

drivers/media/i2c/ov02a10.c:537:6: warning: variable 'ret' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
        if (ov02a10->streaming == on)
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/media/i2c/ov02a10.c:568:9: note: uninitialized use occurs here
        return ret;
               ^~~
drivers/media/i2c/ov02a10.c:537:2: note: remove the 'if' if its condition is always false
        if (ov02a10->streaming == on)
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If streaming is already on, leave it that way and return success.
