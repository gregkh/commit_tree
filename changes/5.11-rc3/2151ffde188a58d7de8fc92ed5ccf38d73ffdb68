ath11k: set credit_update flag for flow controlled ep only

Firmware will check all the pipes before entering WoW mode during suspend. If
ATH11K_HTC_FLAG_NEED_CREDIT_UPDATE is set, firmware treats this pipe needed to
return credit even though it's actually not required. If any pipe needs to
return credit, the suspend_complete message doesn't send to host but is
dropped.  So host gets time out and WoW suspend failed.
