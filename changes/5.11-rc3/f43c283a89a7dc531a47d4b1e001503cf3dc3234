kcmp: In kcmp_epoll_target use fget_task

Use the helper fget_task and simplify the code.

As well as simplifying the code this removes one unnecessary increment of
struct files_struct.  This unnecessary increment of files_struct.count can
result in exec unnecessarily unsharing files_struct and breaking posix
locks, and it can result in fget_light having to fallback to fget reducing
performance.
