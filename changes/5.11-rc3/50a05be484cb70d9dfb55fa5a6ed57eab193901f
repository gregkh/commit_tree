KVM: s390: track synchronous pfault events in kvm_stat

Right now we do count pfault (pseudo page faults aka async page faults
start and completion events). What we do not count is, if an async page
fault would have been possible by the host, but it was disabled by the
guest (e.g. interrupts off, pfault disabled, secure execution....).  Let
us count those as well in the pfault_sync counter.
