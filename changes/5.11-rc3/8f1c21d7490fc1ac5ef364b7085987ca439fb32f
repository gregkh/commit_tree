btrfs: start orphan cleanup on ro->rw remount

When we mount a rw filesystem, we start the orphan cleanup process in
tree root and filesystem tree. However, when we remount a ro file system
rw, we only clean the former. Move the calls to btrfs_orphan_cleanup()
on tree_root and fs_root to the shared rw mount routine to effectively
add them on ro->rw remount.
