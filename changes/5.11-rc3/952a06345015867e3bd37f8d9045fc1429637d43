net: dsa: tag_dsa: let DSA core deal with TX reallocation

Now that we have a central TX reallocation procedure that accounts for
the tagger's needed headroom in a generic way, we can remove the
skb_cow_head call.

Similar to the EtherType DSA tagger, the old Marvell tagger can
transform an 802.1Q header if present into a DSA tag, so there is no
headroom required in that case. But we are ensuring that it exists,
regardless (practically speaking, the headroom must be 4 bytes larger
than it needs to be).
