media: Revert "media: camss: Make use of V4L2_CAP_IO_MC"

This reverts commit c90f1178dcac30dee5ddd29ec0513e7589aa866e.

The assumption of "Each entry in formats[] table has unique mbus_code"
is valid for the RDI entities, but not for the PIX ones.

Reverting this patch and creating a new one which handles the PIX entities
correctly results in smaller and more straightforward patch than doing the
changes on top of the current version.
