proc: fix lookup in /proc/net subdirectories after setns(2)

Commit 1fde6f21d90f ("proc: fix /proc/net/* after setns(2)") only forced
revalidation of regular files under /proc/net/

However, /proc/net/ is unusual in the sense of /proc/net/foo handlers
take netns pointer from parent directory which is old netns.

Steps to reproduce:

	(void)open("/proc/net/sctp/snmp", O_RDONLY);
	unshare(CLONE_NEWNET);

	int fd = open("/proc/net/sctp/snmp", O_RDONLY);
	read(fd, &c, 1);

Read will read wrong data from original netns.

Patch forces lookup on every directory under /proc/net .
