mm/gup_benchmark: rename to mm/gup_test

Patch series "selftests/vm: gup_test, hmm-tests, assorted improvements", v3.

Summary: This series provides two main things, and a number of smaller
supporting goodies.  The two main points are:

1) Add a new sub-test to gup_test, which in turn is a renamed version
   of gup_benchmark.  This sub-test allows nicer testing of dump_pages(),
   at least on user-space pages.

   For quite a while, I was doing a quick hack to gup_test.c whenever I
   wanted to try out changes to dump_page().  Then Matthew Wilcox asked me
   what I meant when I said "I used my dump_page() unit test", and I
   realized that it might be nice to check in a polished up version of
   that.

   Details about how it works and how to use it are in the commit
   description for patch #6 ("selftests/vm: gup_test: introduce the
   dump_pages() sub-test").

2) Fixes a limitation of hmm-tests: these tests are incredibly useful,
   but only if people actually build and run them.  And it turns out that
   libhugetlbfs is a little too effective at throwing a wrench in the
   works, there.  So I've added a little configuration check that removes
   just two of the 21 hmm-tests, if libhugetlbfs is not available.

   Further details in the commit description of patch #8
   ("selftests/vm: hmm-tests: remove the libhugetlbfs dependency").

Other smaller things that this series does:

a) Remove code duplication by creating gup_test.h.

b) Clear up the sub-test organization, and their invocation within
   run_vmtests.sh.

c) Other minor assorted improvements.

This patch (of 9):

Rename nearly every "gup_benchmark" reference and file name to "gup_test".
The one exception is for the actual gup benchmark test itself.

The current code already does a *little* bit more than benchmarking, and
definitely covers more than get_user_pages_fast().  More importantly,
however, subsequent patches are about to add some functionality that is
non-benchmark related.

Closely related changes:

* Kconfig: in addition to renaming the options from GUP_BENCHMARK to
  GUP_TEST, update the help text to reflect that it's no longer a
  benchmark-only test.
