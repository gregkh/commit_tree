rtc: s3c: Remove dead code related to periodic tick handling

Support for periodic tick interrupts has been moved from the RTC class to
the HR-timers long time ago. Then it has been removed from this driver by
commits 80d4bb515b78 ("RTC: Cleanup rtc_class_ops->irq_set_state") and
696160fec162 ("RTC: Cleanup rtc_class_ops->irq_set_freq()"). They however
did not remove all the code related to the tick handling. Do it now then.
