habanalabs: refactor MMU to support dual residency MMU

This commit refactors the MMU code to support PCI MMU page tables
residing on host and DCORE MMU residing on the device DRAM at the
same time.

This is needed for future devices as on GAUDI and GOYA we have
a single MMU where its page tables always reside on DRAM.
