Bluetooth: btusb: Fix detection of some fake CSR controllers with a bcdDevice val of 0x0134

Commit cde1a8a99287 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Fix and detect most of the
Chinese Bluetooth controllers") made the detection of fake controllers
more generic fixing it for much of the newer fakes / clones.

But this does not work for a fake CSR controller with a bcdDevice
value of 0x0134, which was correctly identified as fake before
this change.

Add an extra check for this special case, checking for a combination
of a bcdDevice value of 0x0134, together with a lmp_subver of 0x0c5c
and a hci_ver of BLUETOOTH_VER_2_0.

The chip inside this fake dongle is marked as with "clockwise cw6629d".
