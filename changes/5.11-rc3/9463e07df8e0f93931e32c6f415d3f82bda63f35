media: v4l2-compat-ioctl32.c: add missing #ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIMEs

In two places time32 structures were defined, but they are not
used if CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME is not set. Put these two structs
under #ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME as well to clearly indicate
that they are only used if that config option is set.
