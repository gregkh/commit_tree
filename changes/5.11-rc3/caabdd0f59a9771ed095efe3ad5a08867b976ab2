ctype.h: remove duplicate isdigit() helper

gcc warns a few thousand times about the isdigit() shadow:

include/linux/ctype.h:26:19: warning: declaration of 'isdigit' shadows a built-in function [-Wshadow]

As there is already a compiler builtin, just use that, and make
it clear we do that by defining a macro.  Unfortunately, clang
does not have the isdigit() builtin, so this has to be conditional.
