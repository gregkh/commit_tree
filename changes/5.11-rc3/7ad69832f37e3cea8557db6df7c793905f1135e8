mm/page_alloc: speed up the iteration of max_order

When we free a page whose order is very close to MAX_ORDER and greater
than pageblock_order, it wastes some CPU cycles to increase max_order to
MAX_ORDER one by one and check the pageblock migratetype of that page
repeatedly especially when MAX_ORDER is much larger than pageblock_order.

We also should not be checking migratetype of buddy when "order ==
MAX_ORDER - 1" as the buddy pfn may be invalid, so adjust the condition.
With the new check, we don't need the max_order check anymore, so we
replace it.

Also adjust max_order initialization so that it's lower by one than
previously, which makes the code hopefully more clear.
