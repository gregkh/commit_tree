efi: capsule: clean scatter-gather entries from the D-cache

Scatter-gather lists passed to UpdateCapsule() should be cleaned
from the D-cache to ensure that they are visible to the CPU after a
warm reboot before the MMU is enabled. On ARM and arm64 systems, this
implies a D-cache clean by virtual address to the point of coherency.

However, due to the fact that the firmware itself is not able to map
physical addresses back to virtual addresses when running under the OS,
this must be done by the caller.
