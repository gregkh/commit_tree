net: hns3: fix incorrect handling of sctp6 rss tuple

For DEVICE_VERSION_V2, the hardware only supports src-ip,
dst-ip and verification-tag for rss tuple set of sctp6
packet. For DEVICE_VERSION_V3, the hardware supports
src-port and dst-port as well.

Currently, when user queries the sctp6 rss tuples info,
some unsupported information will be showed on V2. So add
a check for hardware version when initializing and queries
sctp6 rss tuple to fix this issue.
