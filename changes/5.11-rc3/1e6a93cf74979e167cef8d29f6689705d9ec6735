ASoC: soc-dai: add mark for snd_soc_dai_compr_startup/shutdown()

soc_compr_open() does rollback when failed (A),
but, it is almost same as soc_compr_free().

	static int soc_compr_open(xxx)
	{
		...
		if (ret < 0)
			goto xxx_err;
		...
		return 0;

 ^	machine_err:
 |		...
 |	out:
(A)		...
 |	pm_err:
 |		...
 v		return ret;
	}

The difference is
soc_compr_free()  is for all dai/component/substream,
rollback          is for succeeded part only.

This kind of duplicated code can be a hotbed of bugs,
thus, we want to share soc_compr_free() and rollback.
=>	1) snd_soc_dai_compr_startup/shutdown()
	2) snd_soc_component_compr_open/free()
	3) snd_soc_link_compr_startup/shutdown()

This patch is for 1) snd_soc_dai_compr_startup/shutdown(),
and adds new cstream mark.
It will mark cstream when startup() was suceeded.
If rollback happen *after* that, it will check rollback flag
and marked cstream.

It cares *previous* startup() only now,
but we might want to check *whole* marked cstream in the future.
This patch is using macro so that it can be easily adjust to it.
