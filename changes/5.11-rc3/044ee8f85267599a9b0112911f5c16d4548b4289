nvmem: qfprom: Don't touch certain fuses

Some fuse ranges are protected by the XPU such that the AP cannot
access them. Attempting to do so causes an SError. Use the newly
introduced per-soc compatible string, and the newly introduced
nvmem keepout support to attach the set of regions
we should not access.
