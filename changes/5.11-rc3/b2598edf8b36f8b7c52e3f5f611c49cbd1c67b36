btrfs: remove unused argument seed from btrfs_find_device

Commit 343694eee8d8 ("btrfs: switch seed device to list api"), missed to
check if the parameter seed is true in the function btrfs_find_device().
This tells it whether to traverse the seed device list or not.

After this commit, the argument is unused and can be removed.

In device_list_add() it's not necessary because fs_devices always points
to the device's fs_devices. So with the devid+uuid matching, it will
find the right device and return, thus not needing to traverse seed
devices.
