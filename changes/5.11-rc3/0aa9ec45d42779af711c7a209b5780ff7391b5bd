KVM: selftests: Introduce vm_create_[default_]_with_vcpus

Introduce new vm_create variants that also takes a number of vcpus,
an amount of per-vcpu pages, and optionally a list of vcpuids. These
variants will create default VMs with enough additional pages to
cover the vcpu stacks, per-vcpu pages, and pagetable pages for all.
The new 'default' variant uses VM_MODE_DEFAULT, whereas the other
new variant accepts the mode as a parameter.
