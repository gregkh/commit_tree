drm/amdkfd: Put ACPI table after using it

The acpi_get_table() should be coupled with acpi_put_table() if
the mapped table is not used at runtime to release the table
mapping which can prevent the memory leak.

In kfd_create_crat_image_acpi(), crat_table is copied to pcrat_image,
and in kfd_create_vcrat_image_cpu(), the acpi_table is only used to
get the OEM information, so those two table mappings need to be released
after using it.
