ARM: OMAP2+: omap_device: fix idling of devices during probe

On the GTA04A5 od->_driver_status was not set to BUS_NOTIFY_BIND_DRIVER
during probe of the second mmc used for wifi. Therefore
omap_device_late_idle idled the device during probing causing oopses when
accessing the registers.

It was not set because od->_state was set to OMAP_DEVICE_STATE_IDLE
in the notifier callback. Therefore set od->_driver_status also in that
case.

This came apparent after commit 21b2cec61c04 ("mmc: Set
PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS for drivers that existed in v4.4") causing this
oops:
