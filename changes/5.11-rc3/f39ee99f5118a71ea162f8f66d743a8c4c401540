PM: sleep: Print driver flags for all devices during suspend/resume

Currently there are 4 driver flags to control system suspend/resume
behavior: DPM_FLAG_NO_DIRECT_COMPLETE, DPM_FLAG_SMART_PREPARE,
DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND and DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME.

Print these flags during suspend/resume so as to get a brief
understanding of the expected behavior of each device, and to
facilitate suspend/resume debugging/tuning.

To enable this tracing:
echo 'file drivers/base/power/main.c +p' >
/sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
