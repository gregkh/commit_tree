selftests/vm: minor cleanup: Makefile and gup_test.c

A few cleanups that don't deserve separate patches, but that also should
not clutter up other functional changes:

1. Remove an unnecessary #include <prctl.h>

2. Restore the sorted order of TEST_GEN_FILES.

3. Add -lpthread to the common LDLIBS, as it is harmless and several
   tests use it. This gets rid of one special rule already.
