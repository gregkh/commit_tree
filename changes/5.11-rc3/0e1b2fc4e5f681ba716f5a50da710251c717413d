mtd: spi-nor: sfdp: get command opcode extension type from BFPT

Some devices in DTR mode expect an extra command byte called the
extension. The extension can either be same as the opcode, bitwise
inverse of the opcode, or another additional byte forming a 16-byte
opcode. Get the extension type from the BFPT. For now, only flashes with
"repeat" and "inverse" extensions are supported.
