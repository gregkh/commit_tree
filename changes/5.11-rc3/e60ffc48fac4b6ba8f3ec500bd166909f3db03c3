ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_nau8824: Drop compress-cpu-dai bits

When using the snd-soc-sst-acpi driver then the compress-cpu-dai bits are
not used, the cht_bsw_nau8824 machine-driver is the only BYT/CHT driver
defining them.

When using the snd-sof-acpi driver then the presence of the
compress-cpu-dai bits breaks things because the sof topology file for
by/cht devices does not contain routing info for them.

Drop the compress-cpu-dai bits, fixing the snd-sof-acpi driver not
working on devices using the cht_bsw_nau8824 machine-driver.
