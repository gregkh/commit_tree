rds: stop using dmapool

RDMA ULPs should only perform DMA through the ib_dma_* API instead of
using the hidden dma_device directly.  In addition using the dma coherent
API family that dmapool is a part of can be very ineffcient on plaforms
that are not DMA coherent.  Switch to use slab allocations and the
ib_dma_* APIs instead.
