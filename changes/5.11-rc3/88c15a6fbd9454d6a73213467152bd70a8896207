rtw88: coex: fix missing unitialization of variable 'interval'

Currently the variable 'interval' is not initialized and is only set
to 1 when oex_stat->bt_418_hid_existi is true.  Fix this by inintializing
variable interval to 0 (which I'm assuming is the intended default).

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitalized scalar variable")
