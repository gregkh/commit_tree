cpufreq: intel_pstate: Implement the ->adjust_perf() callback

Make intel_pstate expose the ->adjust_perf() callback when it
operates in the passive mode with HWP enabled which causes the
schedutil governor to use that callback instead of ->fast_switch().

The minimum and target performance-level values passed by the
governor to ->adjust_perf() are converted to HWP.REQ.MIN and
HWP.REQ.DESIRED, respectively, which allows the processor to
adjust its configuration to maximize energy-efficiency while
providing sufficient capacity.
