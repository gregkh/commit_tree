gpiolib: cdev: Flag invalid GPIOs as used

When reporting the state of a GPIO to userspace, we never check
for the actual validity of the line, meaning we report invalid
lines as being usable. A subsequent request will fail though,
which is an inconsistent behaviour from a userspace perspective.

Instead, let's check for the validity of the line and report it
as used if it is invalid. This allows a tool such as gpioinfo
to report something sensible:

gpiochip3 - 4 lines:
	line   0:      unnamed       unused   input  active-high
	line   1:      unnamed       kernel   input  active-high [used]
	line   2:      unnamed       kernel   input  active-high [used]
	line   3:      unnamed       unused   input  active-high

In this example, lines 1 and 2 are invalid, and cannot be used by
userspace.
