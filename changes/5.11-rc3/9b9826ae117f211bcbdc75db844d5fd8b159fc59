net: dsa: tag_gswip: let DSA core deal with TX reallocation

Now that we have a central TX reallocation procedure that accounts for
the tagger's needed headroom in a generic way, we can remove the
skb_cow_head call.

This one is interesting, the DSA tag is 8 bytes on RX and 4 bytes on TX.
Because DSA is unaware of asymmetrical tag lengths, the overhead/needed
headroom is declared as 8 bytes and therefore 4 bytes larger than it
needs to be. If this becomes a problem, and the GSWIP driver can't be
converted to a uniform header length, we might need to make DSA aware of
separate RX/TX overhead values.
