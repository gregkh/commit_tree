fs: dlm: add get buffer error handling

This patch adds an error handling to the get buffer functionality if the
user is requesting a buffer length which is more than possible of
the internal buffer allocator. This should never happen because specific
handling decided by compile time, but will warn if somebody forget about
to handle this limitation right.
