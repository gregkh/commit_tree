ASoC: ti: davinci-mcasp: Remove legacy dma_request parsing

The legacy dma_request (which was holding the DMA request number) is no
longer in use for a long time.
All legacy platforms has been converted to dma_slave_map.

Remove it along with the DT parsing to get tx_dma_channel and
rx_dma_channel.
