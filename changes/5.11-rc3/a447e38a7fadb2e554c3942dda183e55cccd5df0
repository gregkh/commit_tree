KVM: VMX: Drop explicit 'nested' check from vmx_set_cr4()

Drop vmx_set_cr4()'s explicit check on the 'nested' module param now
that common x86 handles the check by incorporating VMXE into the CR4
reserved bits, via kvm_cpu_caps.  X86_FEATURE_VMX is set in kvm_cpu_caps
(by vmx_set_cpu_caps()), if and only if 'nested' is true.

No functional change intended.
