drm/gem: Use struct dma_buf_map in GEM vmap ops and convert GEM backends

This patch replaces the vmap/vunmap's use of raw pointers in GEM object
functions with instances of struct dma_buf_map. GEM backends are
converted as well. For most of them, this simply changes the returned type.

TTM-based drivers now return information about the location of the memory,
either system or I/O memory. GEM VRAM helpers and qxl now use ttm_bo_vmap()
et al. Amdgpu, nouveau and radeon use drm_gem_ttm_vmap() et al instead of
implementing their own vmap callbacks.

v7:
	* init QXL cursor to mapped BO buffer (kernel test robot)
v5:
	* update vkms after switch to shmem
v4:
	* use ttm_bo_vmap(), drm_gem_ttm_vmap(), et al. (Daniel, Christian)
	* fix a trailing { in drm_gem_vmap()
	* remove several empty functions instead of converting them (Daniel)
	* comment uses of raw pointers with a TODO (Daniel)
	* TODO list: convert more helpers to use struct dma_buf_map
