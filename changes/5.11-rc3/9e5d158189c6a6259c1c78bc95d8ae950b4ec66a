media: camss: Add support for SDM630/636/660 camera subsystem

Add support for the Qualcomm SDM630/636/660 and SDA variants' camera
subsystem. These SoCs are equipped with:
- 3x CSI PHY 3-Phase v1.0 (downstream csiphy-v3.5)
- 4x CSID v5.0
- 2x ISPIF v3.0
- 2x VFE 4.8
As a note, this camera subsystem is very similar to the one that
is found in the MSM8998/APQ8098 SoCs.
