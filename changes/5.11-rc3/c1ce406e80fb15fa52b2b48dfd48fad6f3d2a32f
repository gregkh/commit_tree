timekeeping: Fix up function documentation for the NMI safe accessors

Alex reported the following warning:

 kernel/time/timekeeping.c:464: warning: Function parameter or member
 'tkf' not described in '__ktime_get_fast_ns'

which is not entirely correct because the documented function is
ktime_get_mono_fast_ns() which does not have a parameter, but the
kernel-doc parser looks at the function declaration which follows the
comment and complains about the missing parameter documentation.

Aside of that the documentation for the rest of the NMI safe accessors is
either incomplete or missing.

  - Move the function documentation to the right place
  - Fixup the references and inconsistencies
  - Add the missing documentation for ktime_get_raw_fast_ns()
