iio: adc: ad7292: remove unneeded spi_set_drvdata()

This seems to have been copied from a driver that calls spi_set_drvdata()
but doesn't call spi_get_drvdata().
Setting a private object on the SPI device's object isn't necessary if it
won't be accessed.
This change removes the spi_set_drvdata() call.
