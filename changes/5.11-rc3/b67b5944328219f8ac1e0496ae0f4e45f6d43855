scsi: lpfc: Reject CT request for MIB commands

Now that MIB support was registered with FDMI, the driver may receive CT
requests for MIB-related commands. At this time, no command is
supported. However, the driver needs to be graceful and reject the CT
request.

This patch adds identification of the requests as well as sending the
reject response.
