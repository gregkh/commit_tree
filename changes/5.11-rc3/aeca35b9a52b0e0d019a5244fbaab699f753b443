powerpc/pseries/mobility: retry partition suspend after error

This is a mitigation for the relatively rare occurrence where a
virtual IOA can be in a transient state that prevents the
suspend/migration from succeeding, resulting in an error from
ibm,suspend-me.

If the join/suspend sequence returns an error, it is acceptable to
retry as long as the VASI suspend session state is still
"Suspending" (i.e. the platform is still waiting for the OS to
suspend).

Retry a few times on suspend failure while this condition holds,
progressively increasing the delay between attempts. We don't want to
retry indefinitey because firmware emits an error log event on each
unsuccessful attempt.
