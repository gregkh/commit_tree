media: meson: Add M2M driver for the Amlogic GE2D Accelerator Unit

The GE2D is a 2D accelerator with various features like configurable
blitter with alpha blending, frame rotation, scaling, format conversion
and colorspace conversion.

The driver implements a Memory2Memory VB2 V4L2 streaming device permitting:
- 0, 90, 180, 270deg rotation
- horizontal/vertical flipping
- source cropping
- destination compositing
- 32bit/24bit/16bit format conversion

This adds the support for the GE2D version found in the AXG SoCs Family.

The missing features are:
- Source scaling
- Colorspace conversion
- Advanced alpha blending & blitting options
