s390: unify identity mapping limits handling

Currently we have to consider too many different values which
in the end only affect identity mapping size. These are:
1. max_physmem_end - end of physical memory online or standby.
   Always <= end of the last online memory block (get_mem_detect_end()).
2. CONFIG_MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS - the maximum size of physical memory the
   kernel is able to support.
3. "mem=" kernel command line option which limits physical memory usage.
4. OLDMEM_BASE which is a kdump memory limit when the kernel is executed as
   crash kernel.
5. "hsa" size which is a memory limit when the kernel is executed during
   zfcp/nvme dump.

Through out kernel startup and run we juggle all those values at once
but that does not bring any amusement, only confusion and complexity.

Unify all those values to a single one we should really care, that is
our identity mapping size.
