checkpatch: prefer static const declarations

There are about 100,000 uses of 'static const <type>' but about 400 uses
of 'static <type> const' in the kernel where type is not a pointer.

The kernel almost always uses "static const" over "const static" as there
is a compiler warning for that declaration style.

But there is no compiler warning for "static <type> const".

So add a checkpatch warning for the atypical declaration uses of.

	const static <type> <foo>
and
	static <type> const <foo>

For example:

  $ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f --emacs --quiet --nosummary -types=static_const arch/arm/crypto/aes-ce-glue.c
  arch/arm/crypto/aes-ce-glue.c:75: WARNING: Move const after static - use 'static const u8'
  #75: FILE: arch/arm/crypto/aes-ce-glue.c:75:
  +	static u8 const rcon[] = {
