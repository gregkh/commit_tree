locktorture: Prevent hangs for invalid arguments

If an locktorture torture-test run is given a bad kvm.sh argument, the
test will complain to the console, which is good.  What is bad is that
from the user's perspective, it will just hang for the time specified
by the --duration argument.  This commit therefore forces an immediate
kernel shutdown if a lock_torture_init()-time error occurs, thus avoiding
the appearance of a hang.  It also forces a console splat in this case
to clearly indicate the presence of an error.
