mmc: tmio: set max_busy_timeout

Set max_busy_timeouts for variants known to support the TOPxx bits in
the SD_OPTION register. The timeout mechanism was running in the
background but not yet properly handled in the driver. So, let the MMC
core know when to not use R1B to avoid unhandled timeouts.

My datasheets for older variants (tmio_mmc.c) suggest that they support
it, too. However, actual bit descriptions are lacking, so I chose an
opt-in approach.
