KVM: arm64: Refuse illegal KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 at reset time

We accept to configure a PMU when a vcpu is created, even if the
HW (or the host) doesn't support it. This results in failures
when attributes get set, which is a bit odd as we should have
failed the vcpu creation the first place.

Move the check to the point where we check the vcpu feature set,
and fail early if we cannot support a PMU. This further simplifies
the attribute handling.
