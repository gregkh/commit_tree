USB: yurex: fix control-URB timeout handling

Make sure to always cancel the control URB in write() so that it can be
reused after a timeout or spurious CMD_ACK.

Currently any further write requests after a timeout would fail after
triggering a WARN() in usb_submit_urb() when attempting to submit the
already active URB.
