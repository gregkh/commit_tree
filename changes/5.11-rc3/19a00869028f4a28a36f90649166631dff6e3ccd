RISC-V: Protect all kernel sections including init early

Currently, .init.text & .init.data are intermixed which makes it impossible
apply different permissions to them. .init.data shouldn't need exec
permissions while .init.text shouldn't have write permission. Moreover,
the strict permission are only enforced /init starts. This leaves the
kernel vulnerable from possible buggy built-in modules.

Keep .init.text & .data in separate sections so that different permissions
are applied to each section. Apply permissions to individual sections as
early as possible. This improves the kernel protection under
CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX. We also need to restore the permissions for the
entire _init section after it is freed so that those pages can be used
for other purpose.
