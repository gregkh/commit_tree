mm/vmalloc.c:__vmalloc_area_node(): avoid 32-bit overflow

With a machine with 3 TB (more than 2 TB memory).  If you use vmalloc to
allocate > 2 TB memory, the array_size below will be overflowed.

The array_size is an unsigned int and can only be used to allocate less
than 2 TB memory.  If you pass 2*1028*1028*1024*1024 = 2 * 2^40 in the
argument of vmalloc.  The array_size will become 2*2^31 = 2^32.  The 2^32
cannot be store with a 32 bit integer.

The fix is to change the type of array_size to unsigned long.
