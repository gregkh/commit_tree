spi: Warn when a driver's remove callback returns an error

The driver core ignores the return value of struct device_driver::remove
(because in general there is nothing that can be done about that). So
add a warning when an spi driver returns an error.

This simplifies the quest to make struct device_driver::remove return void.
A consequent change would be to make struct spi_driver::remove return void,
but I'm keeping this quest for later (or someone else).
