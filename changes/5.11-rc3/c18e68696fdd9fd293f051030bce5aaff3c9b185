net/connector: Add const qualifier to cb_id

The connector driver never modifies any cb_id passed to it, so add a const
qualifier to those arguments so callers can declare their struct cb_id as a
constant object.

Fixes build warnings like these when passing a constant struct cb_id:

  warning: passing argument 1 of ‘cn_add_callback’ discards ‘const’ qualifier from pointer target
