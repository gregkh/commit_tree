drm/vkms: update todo

Drop issues already resolved in vkms:

- CRC API Improvements to [1] add igt test to check extreme alpha values
  and [2] alpha blending;
- [3] prime buffer sharing;
- [4] writeback support;

On the other hand, we also found or thought about other improvements since
the last update of this document:

- better support for IGT tests
- improvements to writeback support
- syzbot report

Finally, we reorder items by the assumed complexity.
