Documentation: doc-guide: fixes to sphinx.rst

Various fixes to sphinx.rst:

- eliminate a double-space between 2 words
- grammar/wording
- punctuation
- call rows in a table 'rows' instead of 'columns' (or does Sphinx
  call everything a column?)
- It seems that "amdfonts" should be "amsfonts". I can't find any
  amdfonts.
