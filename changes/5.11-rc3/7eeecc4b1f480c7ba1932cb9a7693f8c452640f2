net: stmmac: dwmac-sun8i: Fix probe error handling

stmmac_pltfr_remove does three things in one function, making it
inapproprate for unwinding the steps in the probe function. Currently,
a failure before the call to stmmac_dvr_probe would leak OF node
references due to missing a call to stmmac_remove_config_dt. And an
error in stmmac_dvr_probe would cause the driver to attempt to remove a
netdevice that was never added. Fix these by reordering the init and
splitting out the error handling steps.
