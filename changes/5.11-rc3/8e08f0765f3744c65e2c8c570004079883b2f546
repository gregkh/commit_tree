checkpatch: add fix option for LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS

Currently, checkpatch warns if logical continuations are placed at the
start of a line and not at the end of previous line.

E.g., running checkpatch on commit 3485507fc272 ("staging: bcm2835-camera:
Reduce length of enum names") reports:

  CHECK:LOGICAL_CONTINUATIONS: Logical continuations should be on the previous line
  +	if (!ret
  +	    && camera_port ==

Provide a simple fix by inserting logical operator at the last
non-comment, non-whitespace char of the previous line and removing from
current line, if both the lines are additions(ie start with '+')
