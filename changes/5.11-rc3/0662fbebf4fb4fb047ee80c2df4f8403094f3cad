rtw88: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang

In preparation to enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for Clang, fix a
warning by replacing a /* fall through */ comment with the new
pseudo-keyword macro fallthrough; instead of letting the code fall
through to the next case.

Notice that Clang doesn't recognize /* fall through */ comments as
implicit fall-through markings.
