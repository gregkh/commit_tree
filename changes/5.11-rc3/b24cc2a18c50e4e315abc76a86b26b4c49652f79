media: smiapp: Rename as "ccs"

Rename the "smiapp" driver as "ccs". MIPI CCS is the contemporary standard
for raw Bayer camera sensors. The driver retains support for the SMIA++
and SMIA compliant camera sensors. A module alias is added for old user
space using "smiapp" module name.

Add Intel copyright while at it.
