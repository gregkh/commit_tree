jffs2: Fix GC exit abnormally

The log of this problem is:
jffs2: Error garbage collecting node at 0x***!
jffs2: No space for garbage collection. Aborting GC thread

This is because GC believe that it do nothing, so it abort.

After going over the image of jffs2, I find a scene that
can trigger this problem stably.
The scene is: there is a normal dirent node at summary-area,
but abnormal at corresponding not-summary-area with error
name_crc.

The reason that GC exit abnormally is because it find that
abnormal dirent node to GC, but when it goes to function
jffs2_add_fd_to_list, it cannot meet the condition listed
below:

if ((*prev)->nhash == new->nhash && !strcmp((*prev)->name, new->name))

So no node is marked obsolete, statistical information of
erase_block do not change, which cause GC exit abnormally.

The root cause of this problem is: we do not check the
name_crc of the abnormal dirent node with summary is enabled.

Noticed that in function jffs2_scan_dirent_node, we use
function jffs2_scan_dirty_space to deal with the dirent
node with error name_crc. So this patch add a checking
code in function read_direntry to ensure the correctness
of dirent node. If checked failed, the dirent node will
be marked obsolete so GC will pass this node and this
problem will be fixed.
