rxrpc: Don't leak the service-side session key to userspace

Don't let someone reading a service-side rxrpc-type key get access to the
session key that was exchanged with the client.  The server application
will, at some point, need to be able to read the information in the ticket,
but this probably shouldn't include the key material.
