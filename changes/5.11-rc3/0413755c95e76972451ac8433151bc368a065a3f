RDMA/restrack: Store all special QPs in restrack DB

Special QPs (SMI and GSI) have different rules in regards of their QP
numbers. While all other QP numbers are unique per-device, the QP0 and QP1
are created per-port as requested by IBTA.

In multiple port devices, the number of SMI and GSI QPs with be equal to
the number ports.

$ rdma dev
