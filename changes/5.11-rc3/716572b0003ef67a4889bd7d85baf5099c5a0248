selftests/x86/fsgsbase: Fix GS == 1, 2, and 3 tests

Setting GS to 1, 2, or 3 causes a nonsensical part of the IRET microcode
to change GS back to zero on a return from kernel mode to user mode. The
result is that these tests fail randomly depending on when interrupts
happen. Detect when this happens and let the test pass.
