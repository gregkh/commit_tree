scsi: target: Drop sess_cmd_lock from I/O path

Drop the sess_cmd_lock by:

 - Removing the sess_cmd_list use from LIO core, because it's been
   moved to qla2xxx.

 - Removing sess_tearing_down check in the I/O path. Instead of using that
   bit and the sess_cmd_lock, we rely on the cmd_count percpu ref. To do
   this we switch to percpu_ref_kill_and_confirm/percpu_ref_tryget_live.
