habanalabs/gaudi: handle reset when f/w is in preboot

Currently, if the f/w is in preboot/u-boot they don't perform the new
reset mechanism. Therefore, the driver needs to reset the device.
To prevent reset of PCI_IF, the driver needs to first configure the
reset units.

If the security is enabled, the driver can't configure the reset units.
In that situation, don't reset the card.
