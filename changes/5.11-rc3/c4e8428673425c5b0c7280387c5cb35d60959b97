crypto: qat - fix configuration of iov threads

The number of AE2FUNC_MAP registers is different in every QAT device
(c62x, c3xxx and dh895xcc) although the logic and the register offsets
are the same across devices.

This patch separates the logic that configures the iov threads in a
common function that takes as input the number of AE2FUNC_MAP registers
supported by a device. The function is then added to the
adf_hw_device_data structure of each device, and called with the
appropriate parameters.

The configure iov thread logic is added to a new file,
adf_gen2_hw_data.c, that is going to contain code that is shared across
QAT GEN2 devices.
