mips: dts: sead3: Harmonize EHCI/OHCI DT nodes name

In accordance with the Generic EHCI/OHCI bindings the corresponding node
name is suppose to comply with the Generic USB HCD DT schema, which
requires the USB nodes to have the name acceptable by the regexp:
"^usb(@.*)?" . Make sure the "generic-ehci" and "generic-ohci"-compatible
nodes are correctly named.
