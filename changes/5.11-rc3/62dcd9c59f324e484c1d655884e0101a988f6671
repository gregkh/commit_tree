earlycon: simplify earlycon-table implementation

Instead of using the array-of-pointers trick to avoid having gcc mess up
the earlycon array stride, specify type alignment when declaring entries
to prevent gcc from increasing alignment.

This is essentially an alternative (one-line) fix to the problem
addressed by commit dd709e72cb93 ("earlycon: Use a pointer table to fix
__earlycon_table stride").

gcc can increase the alignment of larger objects with static extent as
an optimisation, but this can be suppressed by using the aligned
attribute when declaring variables.

Note that we have been relying on this behaviour for kernel parameters
for 16 years and it indeed hasn't changed since the introduction of the
aligned attribute in gcc-3.1.
