PM / devfreq: Add governor feature flag

The devfreq governor is able to have the specific flag as follows
in order to implement the specific feature. For example, devfreq allows
user to change the governors on runtime via sysfs interface.
But, if devfreq device uses 'passive' governor, don't allow user to change
the governor. For this case, define the DEVFREQ_GOV_FLAG_IMMUTABLE
and set it to flag of passive governor.

[Definition for governor flag]
- DEVFREQ_GOV_FLAG_IMMUTABLE
  : If immutable flag is set, governor is never changeable to other governors.
- DEVFREQ_GOV_FLAG_IRQ_DRIVEN
  : Devfreq core won't schedule polling work for this governor if value is set.
