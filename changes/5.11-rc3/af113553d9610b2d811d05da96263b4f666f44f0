PCI/AER: Add pcie_walk_rcec() to RCEC AER handling

Root Complex Event Collectors (RCEC) appear as peers to Root Ports and also
have the AER capability. In addition, actions need to be taken for
associated RCiEPs. In such cases the RCECs will need to be walked in order
to find and act upon their respective RCiEPs.

Extend the existing ability to link the RCECs with a walking function
pcie_walk_rcec(). Add RCEC support to the current AER service driver and
attach the AER service driver to the RCEC device.
