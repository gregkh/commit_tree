KVM: arm64: Move AArch32 exceptions over to AArch64 sysregs

The use of the AArch32-specific accessors have always been a bit
annoying on 64bit, and it is time for a change.

Let's move the AArch32 exception injection over to the AArch64 encoding,
which requires us to split the two halves of FAR_EL1 into DFAR and IFAR.
This enables us to drop the preempt_disable() games on VHE, and to kill
the last user of the vcpu_cp15() macro.
