libbpf: Unify and speed up BTF string deduplication

Revamp BTF dedup's string deduplication to match the approach of writable BTF
string management. This allows to transfer deduplicated strings index back to
BTF object after deduplication without expensive extra memory copying and hash
map re-construction. It also simplifies the code and speeds it up, because
hashmap-based string deduplication is faster than sort + unique approach.
