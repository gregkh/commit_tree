KVM: x86: ignore SIPIs that are received while not in wait-for-sipi state

In the commit 1c96dcceaeb3
("KVM: x86: fix apic_accept_events vs check_nested_events"),

we accidently started latching SIPIs that are received while the cpu is not
waiting for them.

This causes vCPUs to never enter a halted state.
