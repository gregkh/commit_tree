can: rename CAN FD related can_len2dlc and can_dlc2len helpers

The helper functions can_len2dlc and can_dlc2len are only relevant for
CAN FD data length code (DLC) conversion.

To fit the introduced can_cc_dlc2len for Classical CAN we rename:

can_dlc2len -> can_fd_dlc2len to get the payload length from the DLC
can_len2dlc -> can_fd_len2dlc to get the DLC from the payload length
