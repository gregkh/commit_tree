iommu/vt-d: Move intel_iommu info from struct intel_svm to struct intel_svm_dev

'struct intel_svm' is shared by all devices bound to a give process,
but records only a single pointer to a 'struct intel_iommu'. Consequently,
cache invalidations may only be applied to a single DMAR unit, and are
erroneously skipped for the other devices.

In preparation for fixing this, rework the structures so that the iommu
pointer resides in 'struct intel_svm_dev', allowing 'struct intel_svm'
to track them in its device list.
