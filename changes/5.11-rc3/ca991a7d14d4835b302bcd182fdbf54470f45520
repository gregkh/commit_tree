RDMA/mlx5: Assign dev to DM MR

Currently, DM MR registration flow doesn't set the mlx5_ib_dev pointer and
can cause a NULL pointer dereference if userspace dumps the MR via rdma
tool.

Assign the IB device together with the other fields and remove the
redundant reference of mlx5_ib_dev from mlx5_ib_mr.
