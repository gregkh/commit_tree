drm/bridge: tc358764: restore connector support

This patch restores DRM connector registration in the TC358764 bridge
driver and restores usage of the old drm_panel_* API, thus allows dynamic
panel registration. This fixes panel operation on Exynos5250-based
Arndale board.

This is equivalent to the revert of the following commits:
1644127f83bc "drm/bridge: tc358764: add drm_panel_bridge support"
385ca38da29c "drm/bridge: tc358764: drop drm_connector_(un)register"
and removal of the calls to drm_panel_attach()/drm_panel_detach(), which
were no-ops and has been removed in meanwhile.
