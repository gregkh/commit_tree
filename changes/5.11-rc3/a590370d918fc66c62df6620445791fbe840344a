spi: stm32: FIFO threshold level - fix align packet size

if cur_bpw <= 8 and xfer_len < 4 then the value of fthlv will be 1 and
SPI registers content may have been lost.

* If SPI data register is accessed as a 16-bit register and DSIZE <= 8bit,
  better to select FTHLV = 2, 4, 6 etc

* If SPI data register is accessed as a 32-bit register and DSIZE > 8bit,
  better to select FTHLV = 2, 4, 6 etc, while if DSIZE <= 8bit,
  better to select FTHLV = 4, 8, 12 etc
