powerpc/pseries/mobility: refactor node lookup during DT update

In pseries_devicetree_update(), with each call to ibm,update-nodes the
partition firmware communicates the node to be deleted or updated by
placing its phandle in the work buffer. Each of delete_dt_node(),
update_dt_node(), and add_dt_node() have duplicate lookups using the
phandle value and corresponding refcount management.

Move the lookup and of_node_put() into pseries_devicetree_update(),
and emit a warning on any failed lookups.
