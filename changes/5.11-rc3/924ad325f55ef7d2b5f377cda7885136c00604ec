MAINTAINERS: rectify DELL WMI SYSMAN DRIVERS section

Commit e8a60aa7404b ("platform/x86: Introduce support for Systems
Management Driver over WMI for Dell Systems") added a new section
DELL WMI SYSMAN DRIVERS in MAINTAINERS, but slipped in a typo.

Hence, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains:

  warning: no file matches    F:    drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi-syman/*

Point the file entry to the right location and add an entry for its
Documentation while at it.
