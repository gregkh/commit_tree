iio: proximity: vl53l0x-i2c add i2c_device_id

Add i2c_device_id table for the vl53l0x-i2c driver,
helps in device instantiation using i2c_new_client_device()
or from userspace in cases where device-tree based description
is not possible now, like device(s) on a gbphy i2c adapter
created by greybus.
