perf expr: Force encapsulation on expr_id_data

This patch resolves some undefined behavior where variables in
expr_id_data were accessed (for debugging) without being defined. To
better enforce the tagged union behavior, the struct is moved into
expr.c and accessors provided. Tag values (kinds) are explicitly
identified.
