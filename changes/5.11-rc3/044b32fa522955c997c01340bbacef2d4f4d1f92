dt-bindings:iio:qcom-spmi-vadc drop incorrect io-channel-ranges from example

io-channel-ranges is a property for io-channel consumers. Here
it is in an example of a provider of channels so doesn't do anything
useful.

Recent additions to dt-schema check this property is only provided
alongside io-channels which is not true here and hence an error is
reported.
