arm64: uaccess: remove addr_limit_user_check()

Now that set_fs() is gone, addr_limit_user_check() is redundant. Remove
the checks and associated thread flag.

To ensure that _TIF_WORK_MASK can be used as an immediate value in an
AND instruction (as it is in `ret_to_user`), TIF_MTE_ASYNC_FAULT is
renumbered to keep the constituent bits of _TIF_WORK_MASK contiguous.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
