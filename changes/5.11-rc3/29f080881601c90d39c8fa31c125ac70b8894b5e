kselftest/arm64: check GCR_EL1 after context switch

This test is specific to MTE and verifies that the GCR_EL1 register is
context switched correctly.

It spawns 1024 processes and each process spawns 5 threads.  Each thread
writes a random setting of GCR_EL1 through the prctl() system call and
reads it back verifying that it is the same.  If the values are not the
same it reports a failure.

Note: The test has been extended to verify that even SYNC and ASYNC mode
setting is preserved correctly over context switching.
