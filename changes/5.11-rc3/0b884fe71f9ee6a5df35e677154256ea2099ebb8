i2c: sprd: use a specific timeout to avoid system hang up issue

If the i2c device SCL bus being pulled up due to some exception before
message transfer done, the system cannot receive the completing interrupt
signal any more, it would not exit waiting loop until MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT
jiffies eclipse, that would make the system seemed hang up. To avoid that
happen, this patch adds a specific timeout for message transfer.
