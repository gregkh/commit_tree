cifs: correct four aliased mount parms to allow use of previous names

The updates to the new mount API created aliases for some
mount parms e.g.

   esize, idsfromsid, modefromsid, signloosely
as
   "min_enc_offload", "setuidfromacl", "modesid", "ignore_signature"

but did not add back in the original name expected by test cases
and current users.  It also had incorrect names for a few
less used mount parms.
