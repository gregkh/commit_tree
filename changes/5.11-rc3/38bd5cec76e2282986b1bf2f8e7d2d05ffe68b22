ibmvnic: add some debugs

We sometimes run into situations where a soft/hard reset of the adapter
takes a long time or fails to complete. Having additional messages that
include important adapter state info will hopefully help understand what
is happening, reduce the guess work and minimize requests to reproduce
problems with debug patches.
