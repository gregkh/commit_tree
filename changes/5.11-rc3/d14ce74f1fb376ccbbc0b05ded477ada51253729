irq: Call tick_irq_enter() inside HARDIRQ_OFFSET

Now that account_hardirq_enter() is called after HARDIRQ_OFFSET has
been incremented, there is nothing left that prevents us from also
moving tick_irq_enter() after HARDIRQ_OFFSET is incremented.

The desired outcome is to remove the nasty hack that prevents softirqs
from being raised through ksoftirqd instead of the hardirq bottom half.
Also tick_irq_enter() then becomes appropriately covered by lockdep.
