take the common part of ep_eventpoll_poll() and ep_item_poll() into helper

The only reason why ep_item_poll() can't simply call ep_eventpoll_poll()
(or, better yet, call vfs_poll() in all cases) is that we need to tell
lockdep how deep into the hierarchy of ->mtx we are.  So let's add
a variant of ep_eventpoll_poll() that would take depth explicitly
and turn ep_eventpoll_poll() into wrapper for that.
