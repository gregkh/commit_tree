drm/amd/pm: Replace one-element array with flexible-array member in struct vi_dpm_table

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Use a flexible-array member in struct vi_dpm_table instead of a
one-element array.
