clk: tegra: Fix duplicated SE clock entry

The periph_clks[] array contains duplicated entry for Security Engine
clock which was meant to be defined for T210, but it wasn't added
properly. This patch corrects the T210 SE entry and fixes the following
error message on T114/T124: "Tegra clk 127: register failed with -17".

Fixes: dc37fec48314 ("clk: tegra: periph: Add new periph clks and muxes for Tegra210")
