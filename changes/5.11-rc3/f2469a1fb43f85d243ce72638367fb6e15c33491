sched/core: Wait for tasks being pushed away on hotplug

RT kernels need to ensure that all tasks which are not per CPU kthreads
have left the outgoing CPU to guarantee that no tasks are force migrated
within a migrate disabled section.

There is also some desire to (ab)use fine grained CPU hotplug control to
clear a CPU from active state to force migrate tasks which are not per CPU
kthreads away for power control purposes.

Add a mechanism which waits until all tasks which should leave the CPU
after the CPU active flag is cleared have moved to a different online CPU.
