powerpc/pseries/mobility: signal suspend cancellation to platform

If we're returning an error to user space, use H_VASI_SIGNAL to send a
cancellation request to the platform. This isn't strictly required but
it communicates that Linux will not attempt to complete the suspend,
which allows the various entities involved to promptly end the
operation in progress.
