scsi: lpfc: Convert SCSI I/O completions to SLI-3 and SLI-4 handlers

The current driver implementation uses SLI-4 WQE to iocb conversion before
calling the cmpl callback function.

Rework the FCP I/O completion path to utilize the SLI-4 WQE.

This patch converts the SCSI I/O completion paths from the iocb-centric
interfaces to the routines are native for whether I/Os are iocb-based
(SLI-3) or WQE-based (SLI-4).

Most existing routines were iocb-based, so this creates a lot of SLI-4
specific routines to provide the functionality.
