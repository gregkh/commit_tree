scsi: MAINTAINERS: Make Bodo target_core_user maintainer

Bodo knows the code better than me now, has time to review patches and is
excellent at it, and has lots of ideas for how to make the driver better,
so this patch adds him as the maintainer.

There was no entry in there already. Andy had posted on the list here:

when it got transitioned to me. I added an entry because several companies
used it and I thought it would be easy for them to find Bodo.
