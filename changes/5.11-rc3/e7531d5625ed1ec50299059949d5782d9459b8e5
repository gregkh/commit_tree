media: Fix V4L2_COLORSPACE_470_SYSTEM_BG description

The description of the V4L2_COLORSPACE_470_SYSTEM_BG stated that it was
superseded by SMPTE 170M. That is incorrect. The probably root cause of
this is that the HDMI standard does not support this colorspace and,
unless otherwise signaled, will fall back to SMPTE 170M for SDTV.

However, EBU Tech. 3321 states that sources should signal Rec. 709 as the
colorimetry when using HDMI since the difference between Rec. 709 and
Tech. 3213 are negligible.

Update the text accordingly.

Also drop a spurious " at the end of the Tech 3213 title in the
bibliography.
