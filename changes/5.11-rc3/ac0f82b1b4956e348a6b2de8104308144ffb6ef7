coresight: etm4x: Skip setting LPOVERRIDE bit for qcom, skip-power-up

There is a bug on the systems supporting to skip power up
(qcom,skip-power-up) where setting LPOVERRIDE bit(low-power
state override behaviour) will result in CPU hangs/lockups
even on the implementations which supports it. So skip
setting the LPOVERRIDE bit for such platforms.
