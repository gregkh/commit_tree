drm/amdgpu: switch to use smuio callbacks for AI family

Switch to smuio callbacks: use smuio v9_0 callbacks
for Vega10/12, smuio v11_0 callbacks for Vega20/Arcturus.
APUs don't support enable/disable rom clock gating and
also don't support read bios from rom. So APU flag check
is needed in clock gating callbacks and asic funciton
for read bios from rom to prevent access unknown offset
on APU.
