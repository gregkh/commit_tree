Input: adp5589-keys - do not explicitly control IRQ for wakeup

If device is set up as a wakeup source, I2C core configures the interrupt
line as wake IRQ and PM core automatically configures it for waking up the
system on system suspend transition, so we do not have to explicitly call
enable_irq_wake() and disable_irq_wake() in suspend/resume.
