compat: always include linux/compat.h from net/compat.h

We're about to do reshuffling in networking headers and
eliminate some implicit includes. This results in:

In file included from ../net/ipv4/netfilter/arp_tables.c:26:
include/net/compat.h:60:40: error: unknown type name ‘compat_uptr_t’; did you mean ‘compat_ptr_ioctl’?
    struct sockaddr __user **save_addr, compat_uptr_t *ptr,
                                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                        compat_ptr_ioctl
include/net/compat.h:61:4: error: unknown type name ‘compat_size_t’; did you mean ‘compat_sigset_t’?
    compat_size_t *len);
    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
    compat_sigset_t

Currently net/compat.h depends on linux/compat.h being included
first. After the upcoming changes this would break the 32bit build.
