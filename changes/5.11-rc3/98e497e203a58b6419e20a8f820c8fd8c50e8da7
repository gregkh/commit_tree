drm/i915/dpcd_bl: uncheck PWM_PIN_CAP when detect eDP backlight capabilities

BOE panel with ID 2270 claims both PWM_PIN_CAP and AUX_SET_CAP backlight
control bits, but default chip backlight failed to control brightness.

Check AUX_SET_CAP and proceed to check quirks or VBT backlight type.
DPCD can control the brightness of this pannel.
