arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Set 'polling-delay-passive' for thermal zones back to 250 ms

Commit 22337b91022d ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Changed polling mode
in Thermal-zones node") sets both 'polling-delay' and
'polling-delay-passive' to zero with the rationale that TSENS interrupts
are enabled. A TSENS interrupt fires when the temperature of a thermal
zone reaches a trip point, which makes regular polling below the passive
trip point temperature unnecessary. However the situation is different
when passive cooling is active, regular polling is still needed to
trigger a periodic evaluation of the thermal zone by the thermal governor.

Change 'polling-delay-passive' back to the original value of 250 ms.
Commit 2315ae70af95 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add gpu cooling
support") recently changed the value for the GPU thermal zones from
zero to 100 ms, also set it to 250 ms for uniformity. If some zones
really need different values these can be changed in dedicated patches.
