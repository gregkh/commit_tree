btrfs: remove inode number cache feature

It's been deprecated since commit b547a88ea577 ("btrfs: start
deprecation of mount option inode_cache") which enumerates the reasons.

A filesystem that uses the feature (mount -o inode_cache) tracks the
inode numbers in bitmaps, that data stay on the filesystem after this
patch. The size is roughly 5MiB for 1M inodes [1], which is considered
small enough to be left there. Removal of the change can be implemented
in btrfs-progs if needed.
