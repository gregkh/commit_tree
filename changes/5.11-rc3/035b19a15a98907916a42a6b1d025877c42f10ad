powerpc/32s: Always map kernel text and rodata with BATs

Since commit 2b279c0348af ("powerpc/32s: Allow mapping with BATs with
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC"), there is no real situation where mapping without
BATs is required.

In order to simplify memory handling, always map kernel text
and rodata with BATs even when "nobats" kernel parameter is set.

Also fix the 603 TLB miss exceptions that don't require anymore
kernel page table if DEBUG_PAGEALLOC.
