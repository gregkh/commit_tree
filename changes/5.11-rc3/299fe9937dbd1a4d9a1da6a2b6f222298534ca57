ASoC: meson: fix COMPILE_TEST error

When compiled with CONFIG_HAVE_CLK, the kernel need to get provider for the
clock API. This is usually selected by the platform and the sound drivers
should not really care about this. However COMPILE_TEST is special and the
platform required may not have been selected, leading to this type of
error:

> aiu-encoder-spdif.c:(.text+0x3a0): undefined reference to `clk_set_parent'

Since we need a sane provider of the API with COMPILE_TEST, depends on
COMMON_CLK.
