net/mlx5_core: Clean driver version and name

Remove exposed driver version as it was done in other drivers,
so module version will work correctly by displaying the kernel
version for which it is compiled.

And move mlx5_core module name to general include, so auxiliary drivers
will be able to use it as a basis for a name in their device ID tables.
