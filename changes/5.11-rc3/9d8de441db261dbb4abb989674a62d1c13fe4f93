scsi: lpfc: Correct null ndlp reference on routine exit

smatch correctly called out a logic error with accessing a pointer after
checking it for null:

 drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_els.c:2043 lpfc_cmpl_els_plogi()
 error: we previously assumed 'ndlp' could be null (see line 1942)

Adjust the exit point to avoid the trace printf ndlp reference. A trace
entry was already generated when the ndlp was checked for null.
