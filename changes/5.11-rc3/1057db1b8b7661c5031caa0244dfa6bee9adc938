ath11k: Fix beamformee STS in HE cap

STS Beamformee capability sent from firmware is overwritten as
num_tx_chains - 1.
When num_tx_chains is 2, then STS is set to invalid value 1.
Since STS is not limited by number of TX chain, not overwriting the
capability received from firmware.

Tested on: IPQ6018 WLAN.HK.2.4.0.1-00303-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
