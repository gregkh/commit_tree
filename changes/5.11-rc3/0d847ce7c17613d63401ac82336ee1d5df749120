x86/setup: Remove unused MCA variables

Commit

  bb8187d35f82 ("MCA: delete all remaining traces of microchannel bus support.")

removed the remaining traces of Micro Channel Architecture support but
one trace remained - three variables in setup.c which have been unused
since 2012 at least.

Drop them finally.
