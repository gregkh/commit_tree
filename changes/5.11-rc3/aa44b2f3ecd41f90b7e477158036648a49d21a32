ath11k: start vdev if a bss peer is already created

For QCA6390, bss peer must be created before vdev is to start. This
change is to start vdev if a bss peer is created. Otherwise, ath11k
delays to start vdev.

This fixes an issue in a case where HT/VHT/HE settings change between
authentication and association, e.g., due to the user space request
to disable HT.
