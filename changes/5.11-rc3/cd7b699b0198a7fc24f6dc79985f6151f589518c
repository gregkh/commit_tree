cifs: Tracepoints and logs for tracing credit changes.

There is at least one suspected bug in crediting changes in cifs.ko
which has come up a few times in the discussions and in a customer
case.

This change adds tracepoints to the code which modifies the server
credit values in any way. The goal is to be able to track the changes
to the credit values of the session to be able to catch when there is
a crediting bug.
