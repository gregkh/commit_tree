jffs2: Fix ignoring mounting options problem during remounting

The jffs2 mount options will be ignored when remounting jffs2.
It can be easily reproduced with the steps listed below.
1. mount -t jffs2 -o compr=none /dev/mtdblockx /mnt
2. mount -o remount compr=zlib /mnt

Since ec10a24f10c8, the option parsing happens before fill_super and
then pass fc, which contains the options parsing results, to function
jffs2_reconfigure during remounting. But function jffs2_reconfigure do
not update c->mount_opts.

This patch add a function jffs2_update_mount_opts to fix this problem.

By the way, I notice that tmpfs use the same way to update remounting
options. If it is necessary to unify them?
