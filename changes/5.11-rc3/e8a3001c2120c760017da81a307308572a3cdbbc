sctp: add encap_port for netns sock asoc and transport

encap_port is added as per netns/sock/assoc/transport, and the
latter one's encap_port inherits the former one's by default.
The transport's encap_port value would mostly decide if one
packet should go out with udp encapsulated or not.

This patch also allows users to set netns' encap_port by sysctl.

v1->v2:
  - Change to define encap_port as __be16 for sctp_sock, asoc and
    transport.
v2->v3:
  - No change.
v3->v4:
  - Add 'encap_port' entry in ip-sysctl.rst.
v4->v5:
  - Improve the description of encap_port in ip-sysctl.rst.
