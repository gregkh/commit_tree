media: staging: rkisp1: cap: fix timeout when stopping the stream

The dma engine should be stopped first.
The driver waits for an interrupt to stop the stream in a known state
after a frame.
If rkisp1_cap_stream_disable() is called after stopping the rest of the
pipeline, then most likely the interrupt won't arrive, we'll get a
timeout and debugfs variables mp_stop_timeout or sp_stop_timeout will
be incremented.
