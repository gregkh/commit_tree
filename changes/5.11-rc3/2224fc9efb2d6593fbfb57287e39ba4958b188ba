KVM: x86: Expose AVX512_FP16 for supported CPUID

AVX512_FP16 is supported by Intel processors, like Sapphire Rapids.
It could gain better performance for it's faster compared to FP32
if the precision or magnitude requirements are met. It's availability
is indicated by CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=0):EDX[bit 23].

Expose it in KVM supported CPUID, then guest could make use of it; no
new registers are used, only new instructions.
