x86: Support kmap_local() forced debugging

kmap_local() and related interfaces are NOOPs on 64bit and only create
temporary fixmaps for highmem pages on 32bit. That means the test coverage
for this code is pretty small.

CONFIG_KMAP_LOCAL can be enabled independent from CONFIG_HIGHMEM, which
allows to provide support for enforced kmap_local() debugging even on
64bit.

For 32bit the support is unconditional, for 64bit it's only supported when
CONFIG_NR_CPUS <= 4096 as supporting it for 8192 CPUs would require to set
up yet another fixmap PGT.

If CONFIG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_DEBUG is enabled then kmap_local()/kmap_atomic()
will use the temporary fixmap mapping path.
