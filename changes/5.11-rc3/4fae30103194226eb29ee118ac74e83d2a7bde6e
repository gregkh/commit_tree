mfd: mt6397: Drop of_match_ptr from of_device_id table

The driver can match only via the DT table so the table should be always
used and the of_match_ptr does not have any sense (this also allows ACPI
matching via PRP0001, even though it is not relevant here).  This fixes
compile warning (!CONFIG_OF on x86_64):

  drivers/mfd/mt6397-core.c:214:34: warning: ‘mt6397_of_match’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
