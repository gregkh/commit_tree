drm/virtio: use kvmalloc for large allocations

We observed that some of virtio_gpu_object_shmem_init() allocations
can be rather costly - order 6 - which can be difficult to fulfill
under memory pressure conditions. Switch to kvmalloc_array() in
virtio_gpu_object_shmem_init() and let the kernel vmalloc the entries
array.
