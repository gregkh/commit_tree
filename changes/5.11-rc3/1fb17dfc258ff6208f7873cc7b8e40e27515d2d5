Bluetooth: Fix: LL PRivacy BLE device fails to connect

When adding device to white list the device is added to resolving list
also. It has to be added only when HCI_ENABLE_LL_PRIVACY flag is set.
HCI_ENABLE_LL_PRIVACY flag has to be tested before adding/deleting devices
to resolving list. use_ll_privacy macro is used only to check if controller
supports LL_Privacy.
