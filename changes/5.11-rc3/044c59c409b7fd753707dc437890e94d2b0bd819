KVM: Don't allocate dirty bitmap if dirty ring is enabled

Because kvm dirty rings and kvm dirty log is used in an exclusive way,
Let's avoid creating the dirty_bitmap when kvm dirty ring is enabled.
At the meantime, since the dirty_bitmap will be conditionally created
now, we can't use it as a sign of "whether this memory slot enabled
dirty tracking".  Change users like that to check against the kvm
memory slot flags.

Note that there still can be chances where the kvm memory slot got its
dirty_bitmap allocated, _if_ the memory slots are created before
enabling of the dirty rings and at the same time with the dirty
tracking capability enabled, they'll still with the dirty_bitmap.
However it should not hurt much (e.g., the bitmaps will always be
freed if they are there), and the real users normally won't trigger
this because dirty bit tracking flag should in most cases only be
applied to kvm slots only before migration starts, that should be far
latter than kvm initializes (VM starts).
