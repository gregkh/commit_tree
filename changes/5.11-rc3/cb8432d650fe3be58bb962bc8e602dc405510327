block: allocate struct hd_struct as part of struct bdev_inode

Allocate hd_struct together with struct block_device to pre-load
the lifetime rule changes in preparation of merging the two structures.

Note that part0 was previously embedded into struct gendisk, but is
a separate allocation now, and already points to the block_device instead
of the hd_struct.  The lifetime of struct gendisk is still controlled by
the struct device embedded in the part0 hd_struct.
