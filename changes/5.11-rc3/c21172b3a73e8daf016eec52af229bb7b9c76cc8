watchdog: iTCO_wdt: use dev_*() instead of pr_*() for logging

For device log outputs, it's better to have device name / ID
prefixed in all messages, so use the proper dev_*() functions here.

Explicit message on module load/unload don't seem to be really helpful
(we have other means to check which modules have been loaded), instead
just add noise to the kernel log. So, removing them.
