USB: usblp: fix DMA to stack

Stack-allocated buffers cannot be used for DMA (on all architectures).

Replace the HP-channel macro with a helper function that allocates a
dedicated transfer buffer so that it can continue to be used with
arguments from the stack.

Note that the buffer is cleared on allocation as usblp_ctrl_msg()
returns success also on short transfers (the buffer is only used for
debugging).
