dt-bindings: memory: tegra: Add missing swgroups

According to Tegra X1 TRM, there are missing swgroups in the
tegra210_swgroups list. So this patch adds them in bindings.

Note that the TEGRA_SWGROUP_GPU (in list) should be actually
TEGRA_SWGROUP_GPUB (in TRM), yet TEGRA_SWGROUP_GPU (in TRM)
is not being used -- only TEGRA_SWGROUP_GPUB (in TRM) is. So
this patch does not add TEGRA_SWGROUP_GPU (in TRM) and keeps
TEGRA_SWGROUP_GPU (in list) as it is.
