ARM: OMAP2+: Drop legacy platform data for am4 control module

We can now probe devices with ti-sysc interconnect driver and dts
data. Let's drop the related platform data and custom ti,hwmods
dts property.

To drop the legacy platform data for am3 control module, we need
to configure the missing functional clock and tag the module to
not idle as platform data also had it configured with
HWMOD_INIT_NO_IDLE.
