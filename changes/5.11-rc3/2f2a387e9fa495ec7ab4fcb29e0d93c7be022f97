media: doc: pixfmt-packed-yuv: Express 4:4:4 formats in a more compact way

The 4:4:4 packed YUV formats are documented with a bit-level
representation, which creates a wide table. Switch to a byte-oriented
representation to make it more compact. This prepares for the addition
of formats with more than 8 bits per component, that would make the
table way too wide.
