psci: Replace psci_function_id array with a struct

Small refactor that replaces array of v0.1 function IDs indexed by an
enum of function-name constants with a struct of function IDs "indexed"
by field names. This is done in preparation for exposing the IDs to
other parts of the kernel. Exposing a struct avoids the need for
bounds checking.
