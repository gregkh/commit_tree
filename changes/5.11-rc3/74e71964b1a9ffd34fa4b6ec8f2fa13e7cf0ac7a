uio: uio_hv_generic: use devm_kzalloc() for private data alloc

This is a minor cleanup for the management of the private object of this
driver. The allocation can be tied to the life-time of the hv_device
object.
This cleans up a bit the exit & error paths, since the object doesn't need
to be explicitly free'd anymore.
