spi: atmel-quadspi: Fix AHB memory accesses

Following error was seen when mounting a 16MByte ubifs:
UBIFS error (ubi0:0 pid 1893): check_lpt_type.constprop.6: invalid type (15) in LPT node type

QSPI_IFR.TFRTYP was not set correctly. When data transfer is enabled
and one wants to access the serial memory through AHB in order to:
 - read in the serial memory, but not a memory data, for example
   a JEDEC-ID, QSPI_IFR.TFRTYP must be written to '0' (both sama5d2
   and sam9x60).
 - read in the serial memory, and particularly a memory data,
   TFRTYP must be written to '1' (both sama5d2 and sam9x60).
 - write in the serial memory, but not a memory data, for example
   writing the configuration or the QSPI_SR, TFRTYP must be written
   to '2' for sama5d2 and to '0' for sam9x60.
 - write in the serial memory in particular to program a memory data,
   TFRTYP must be written to '3' for sama5d2 and to '1' for sam9x60.

Fix the setting of the QSPI_IFR.TFRTYP field.
