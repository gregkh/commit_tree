drm: deprecate DRM_FORMAT_MOD_NONE

DRM_FORMAT_MOD_NONE is in the list of vendors, which is pretty
confusing. We already have DRM_FORMAT_MOD_VENDOR_NONE. Move it down in
the list of format modifiers.

DRM_FORMAT_MOD_NONE is an alias for DRM_FORMAT_MOD_LINEAR, however the
name is confusing: NONE doesn't mean that the modifier is implicit,
instead it means that the layout is linear. Deprecate it.
