drm/virtio: implement blob resources: blob display integration

SCANOUT_BLOB forwards the DRM framebuffer metadata to the host. The
modifier is intentionally left out -- it may be possible to query
the host for that.

We also assume one blob resource per DRM framebuffer.  That too is
an intentional simplification.
