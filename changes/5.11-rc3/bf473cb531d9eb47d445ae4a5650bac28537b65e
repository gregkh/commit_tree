drm/i915: Fix cursor src/dst rectangle with bigjoiner

We can't call drm_plane_state_src() this late for the slave plane since
it would consult the wrong uapi state. We've alreayd done the correct
uapi->hw copy earlier, so let's just preserve the unclipped src/dst
rects using a temp copy across the intel_atomic_plane_check_clipping()
call.
