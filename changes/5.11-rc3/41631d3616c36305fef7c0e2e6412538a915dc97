usb: core: Replace in_interrupt() in comments

The usage of in_interrupt() in drivers is phased out for various reasons.

Various comments use !in_interrupt() to describe calling context for
functions which might sleep. That's wrong because the calling context has
to be preemptible task context, which is not what !in_interrupt()
describes.

Replace !in_interrupt() with more accurate plain text descriptions.

The comment for usb_hcd_poll_rh_status() is misleading as this function is
called from all kinds of contexts including preemptible task
context. Remove it as there is obviously no restriction.
