x86/cpufeatures: Add Intel SGX hardware bits

Populate X86_FEATURE_SGX feature from CPUID and tie it to the Kconfig
option with disabled-features.h.

IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL.SGX_ENABLE must be examined in addition to the CPUID
bits to enable full SGX support.  The BIOS must both set this bit and lock
IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL for SGX to be supported (Intel SDM section 36.7.1).
The setting or clearing of this bit has no impact on the CPUID bits above,
which is why it needs to be detected separately.
