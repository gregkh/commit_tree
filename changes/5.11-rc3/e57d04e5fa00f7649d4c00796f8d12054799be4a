x86/apic: Get rid of apic:: Dest_logical

struct apic has two members which store information about the destination
mode: dest_logical and irq_dest_mode.

dest_logical contains a mask which was historically used to set the
destination mode in IPI messages. Over time the usage was reduced and the
logical/physical functions were seperated.

There are only a few places which still use 'dest_logical' but they can
use 'irq_dest_mode' instead.

irq_dest_mode is actually a boolean where 0 means physical destination mode
and 1 means logical destination mode. Of course the name does not reflect
the functionality. This will be cleaned up in a subsequent change.

Remove apic::dest_logical and fixup the remaining users.
