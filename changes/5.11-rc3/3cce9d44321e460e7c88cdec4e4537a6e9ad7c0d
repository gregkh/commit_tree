ARM: 9044/1: vfp: use undef hook for VFP support detection

Commit f77ac2e378be9dd6 ("ARM: 9030/1: entry: omit FP emulation for UND
exceptions taken in kernel mode") failed to take into account that there
is in fact a case where we relied on this code path: during boot, the
VFP detection code issues a read of FPSID, which will trigger an undef
exception on cores that lack VFP support.

So let's reinstate this logic using an undef hook which is registered
only for the duration of the initcall to vpf_init(), and which sets
VFP_arch to a non-zero value - as before - if no VFP support is present.
