rtw88: coex: separate BLE HID profile from BLE profile

BT firmware will report BLE-HID and BLE-RCU in different profile.
We can distinguish the two profile from BT info now.

Add the coexistence for BLE-HID coexistence,
it can make BLE HID work more smoothly.

BLE-HID need to Tx/Rx packet more frequently to respond
user operation, but RCU doesn't.

In the case of RCU coexistence, it will make Wi-Fi have a
higher priority to earn more Wi-Fi throughput.

If BLE-HID go for the same case,
it will make user feel mouse is lagging.

Desired BT firmware BT-COEX version: 0x1c
Desired WL firmware version: 9.9
