mm: fix a race on nr_swap_pages

The scenario on which "Free swap = -4kB" happens in my system, which is caused
by several get_swap_pages racing with each other and show_swap_cache_info
happens simutaniously. No need to add a lock on get_swap_page_of_type as we
remove "Presub/PosAdd" here.

ProcessA			ProcessB			ProcessC
ngoals = 1			ngoals = 1
avail = nr_swap_pages(1)	avail = nr_swap_pages(1)
nr_swap_pages(1) -= ngoals
				nr_swap_pages(0) -= ngoals
								nr_swap_pages = -1
