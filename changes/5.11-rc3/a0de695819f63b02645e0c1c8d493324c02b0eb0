Documentation: gpio: fix typo and unclear legacy API section

The "Interacting With the Legacy GPIO Subsystem" of the documentation
was unclear at best, and even included a sentence that seems to say the
opposite of what it should say about the lifetime of the return value of
the conversion functions.

Try to clarify things a bit and hopefully make that section more
readable.
