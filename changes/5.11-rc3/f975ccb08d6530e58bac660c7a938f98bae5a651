KVM: arm64: Remove PMU RAZ/WI handling

There is no RAZ/WI handling allowed for the PMU registers in the
ARMv8 architecture. Nobody can remember how we cam to the conclusion
that we could do this, but the ARMv8 ARM is pretty clear that we cannot.

Remove the RAZ/WI handling of the PMU system registers when it is
not configured.
