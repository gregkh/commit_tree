ACPI: scan: Add acpi_info_matches_hids() helper

acpi_device_dep_initialize() disergards _DEP "suppliers" with a _HID
of "INT3396" and checks this using an acpi_device_info struct.

Because in general there are other device IDs that need to be treated
in the same way, add acpi_info_matches_hids() which checks a list of
_HIDs for this purpose and switch acpi_device_dep_initialize() over
to using it.
