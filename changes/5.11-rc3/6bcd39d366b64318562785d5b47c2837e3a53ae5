selftests/bpf: Add CO-RE relocs selftest relying on kernel module BTF

Add a self-tests validating libbpf is able to perform CO-RE relocations
against the type defined in kernel module BTF. if bpf_testmod.o is not
supported by the kernel (e.g., due to version mismatch), skip tests, instead
of failing.
