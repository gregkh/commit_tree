ASoC: sun8i-codec: Prepare to extend the DAI driver

In preparation for adding additional DAIs to this component, convert the
DAI driver definition to an array. Since this changes all of the lines
in the definition anyway, let's move it closer to the ops function
definitions, instead of on the far side of the DAPM arrays. And while
moving the DAI driver ops, rename the set_fmt hook to match the usual
naming scheme.

Give the existing DAI an explicit ID and more meaningful stream names,
so it will remain unique as more DAIs are added. The AIF widget streams
must be updated to match.
