mlxsw: reg: Add Switch Port VLAN Classification Register

SPVC configures the port to identify packets as untagged / single tagged /
double tagged packets based on the packet EtherTypes.

It will be used to classify 802.1q packets as untagged and 802.1ad packets
as tagged when received by ports member in a 802.1ad bridge.
