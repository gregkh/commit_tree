virtio-mem: generalize handling when memory is getting onlined deferred

We don't want to add too much memory when it's not getting onlined
immediately, to avoid running OOM. Generalize the handling, to avoid
making use of memory block states. Use a threshold of 1 GiB for now.

Properly adjust the offline size when adding/removing memory. As we are
not always protected by a lock when touching the offline size, use an
atomic64_t. We don't care about races (e.g., someone offlining memory
while we are adding more), only about consistent values.

(1 GiB needs a memmap of ~16MiB - which sounds reasonable even for
 setups with little boot memory and (possibly) one virtio-mem device per
 node)

We don't want to retrigger when onlining is caused immediately by our
action (e.g., adding memory which immediately gets onlined), so use a
flag to indicate if the workqueue is active and use that as an
indicator whether to trigger a retry. This will also be especially relevant
for Big Block Mode (BBM), whereby we might re-online memory in case
offlining of another memory block failed.
