arm64: lto: Strengthen READ_ONCE() to acquire when CONFIG_LTO=y

When building with LTO, there is an increased risk of the compiler
converting an address dependency headed by a READ_ONCE() invocation
into a control dependency and consequently allowing for harmful
reordering by the CPU.

Ensure that such transformations are harmless by overriding the generic
READ_ONCE() definition with one that provides acquire semantics when
building with LTO.
