Input: tm2-touchkey - add vddio regulator

The Samsung touchkey controllers are often used with external pull-up
for the interrupt line and the I2C lines, so we might need to enable
a regulator to bring the lines into usable state. Otherwise, this might
cause spurious interrupts and reading from I2C will fail.

Implement support for a "vddio-supply" that is enabled by the
tm2-touchkey driver so that the regulator gets enabled when needed.
