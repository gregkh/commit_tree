Revert ibmvnic merge do_change_param_reset into do_reset

This reverts commit 16b5f5ce351f8709a6b518cc3cbf240c378305bf
where it restructures do_reset. There are patches being tested that
would require major rework if this is committed first.

We will resend this after the other patches have been applied.
