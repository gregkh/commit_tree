iommu/io-pgtable: Remove tlb_flush_leaf

The only user of tlb_flush_leaf is a particularly hairy corner of the
Arm short-descriptor code, which wants a synchronous invalidation to
minimise the races inherent in trying to split a large page mapping.
This is already far enough into "here be dragons" territory that no
sensible caller should ever hit it, and thus it really doesn't need
optimising. Although using tlb_flush_walk there may technically be
more heavyweight than needed, it does the job and saves everyone else
having to carry around useless baggage.
