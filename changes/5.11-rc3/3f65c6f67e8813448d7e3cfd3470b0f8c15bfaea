media: v4l2: allocate v4l2_clip objects early

The v4l2_format based ioctls can have an indirect pointer to an array
of v4l2_clip structures for overlay mode, depending on the 'type' member.
There are only five drivers that use the overlay mode and copy the
data through the __user pointer.

Change the five drivers to use memcpy() instead, and copy the data
in common code using the check_array_args() helpers. This allows
for a subsequent patch that use the same mechanism for compat
ioctl handlers.

Note that there is another pointer for a 'bitmap' that is only
used in the 'vivid' driver and nowhere else. There is no easy
way to use the same trick without adding complexity to the
common code, so this remains a __user pointer.
