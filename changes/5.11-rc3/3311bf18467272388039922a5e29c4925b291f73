nvmem: imx-ocotp: add support for the unaliged word count

When offset is not 4 bytes aligned, directly shift righty by 2 bits
will cause reading out wrong data. Since imx ocotp only supports
4 bytes reading once, we need handle offset is not 4 bytes aligned
and enlarge the bytes to 4 bytes aligned. After reading finished,
copy the needed data from buffer to caller and free buffer.
