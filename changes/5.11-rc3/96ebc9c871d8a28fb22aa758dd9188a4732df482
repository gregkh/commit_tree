usb: uas: Add PNY USB Portable SSD to unusual_uas

Here's another variant PNY Pro Elite USB 3.1 Gen 2 portable SSD that
hangs and doesn't respond to ATA_1x pass-through commands. If it doesn't
support these commands, it should respond properly to the host. Add it
to the unusual uas list to be able to move forward with other
operations.
