dt-bindings:iio:temperature:maxim_thermocouple.txt to maxim,max31855k.yaml

Given we already have another maxim thermocouple driver that isn't
covered by this binding it seems a better idea to chose to name it
after a specific part.

I added an additional example for the maxim,max6755 to illustrate
the need for spi-cpha for that part.
