powerpc/32s: Cleanup around PTE_FLAGS_OFFSET in hash_low.S

PTE_FLAGS_OFFSET is defined in asm/page_32.h and used only
in hash_low.S

And PTE_FLAGS_OFFSET nullity depends on CONFIG_PTE_64BIT

Instead of tests like #if (PTE_FLAGS_OFFSET != 0), use
CONFIG_PTE_64BIT related code.

Also move the definition of PTE_FLAGS_OFFSET into hash_low.S
directly, that improves readability.
