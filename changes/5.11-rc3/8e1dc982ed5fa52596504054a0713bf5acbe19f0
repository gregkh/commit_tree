btrfs: remove unused parameter phy_offset from btrfs_validate_metadata_buffer

Parameter @phy_offset is the offset against the bio->bi_iter.bi_sector.
@phy_offset is mostly for data io to lookup the csum in btrfs_io_bio.

But for metadata, it's completely useless as metadata stores their own
csum in its header, so we can remove it.

Note: parameters @start and @end, they are not utilized at all for
current sectorsize == PAGE_SIZE case, as we can grab eb directly from
page.

But those two parameters are very important for later subpage support,
thus @start/@len are not touched here.
