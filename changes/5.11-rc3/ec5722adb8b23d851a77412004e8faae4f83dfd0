drm/fourcc: document modifier uniqueness requirements

There have suggestions to bake pitch alignment, address alignment,
contiguous memory or other placement (hidden VRAM, GTT/BAR, etc)
constraints into modifiers. Last time this was brought up it seemed
like the consensus was to not allow this. Document this in drm_fourcc.h.

There are several reasons for this.

- Encoding all of these constraints in the modifiers would explode the
  search space pretty quickly (we only have 64 bits to work with).
- Modifiers need to be unambiguous: a buffer can only have a single
  modifier.
- Modifier users aren't expected to parse modifiers (except drivers).

v2: add paragraph about aliases (Daniel)

v3: fix unrelated changes sent with the patch

v4: disambiguate users between driver and higher-level programs (Brian,
Daniel)

v5: fix AFBC example (Brian, Daniel)

v6: remove duplicated paragraph (Daniel)
