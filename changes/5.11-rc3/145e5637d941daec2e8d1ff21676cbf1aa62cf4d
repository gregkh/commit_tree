net/mlx5e: Add TX PTP port object support

Add TX PTP port object support for better TX timestamping accuracy.
Currently, driver supports CQE based TX port timestamp. Device
also offers TX port timestamp, which has less jitter and better
reflects the actual time of a packet's transmit.

Define new driver layout called ptpsq, on which driver will create
SQs that will support TX port timestamp for their transmitted packets.
Driver to identify PTP TX skbs and steer them to these dedicated SQs
as part of the select queue ndo.

Driver to hold ptpsq per TC and report them at
netif_set_real_num_tx_queues().

Add support for all needed functionality in order to xmit and poll
completions received via ptpsq.

Add ptpsq to the TX reporter recover, diagnose and dump methods.

Creation of ptpsqs is disabled by default, and can be enabled via
tx_port_ts private flag.

This patch steer all timestamp related packets to a ptpsq, but it
does not open the port timestamp support for it. The support will
be added in the following patch.
