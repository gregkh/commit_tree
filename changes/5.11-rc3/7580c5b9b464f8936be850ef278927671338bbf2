checkpatch: add fix option for GERRIT_CHANGE_ID

Currently, whenever a Gerrit Change-Id is present in a commit,
checkpatch.pl warns to remove the Change-Id before submitting the patch.

E.g., running checkpatch on commit adc311a5bbf6 ("iwlwifi: bump FW
API to 53 for 22000 series") reports this error:

  ERROR: Remove Gerrit Change-Id's before submitting upstream
  Change-Id: I5725e46394f3f53c3069723fd513cc53c7df383d

Provide a simple fix option by simply deleting the indicated line.
