SMB3.1.1: do not log warning message if server doesn't populate salt

In the negotiate protocol preauth context, the server is not required
to populate the salt (although it is done by most servers) so do
not warn on mount.

We retain the checks (warn) that the preauth context is the minimum
size and that the salt does not exceed DataLength of the SMB response.
Although we use the defaults in the case that the preauth context
response is invalid, these checks may be useful in the future
as servers add support for additional mechanisms.
