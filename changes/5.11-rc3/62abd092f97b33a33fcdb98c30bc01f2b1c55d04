ALSA: usb-audio: Add implicit_fb module option

A new module option, implicit_fb, is added to specify the driver
looking for the implicit feedback sync.  This can be useful for a
device that could be working better in the implicit feed back mode and
user wants to test it quickly.  When this works, we can add the quirk
entry easily.
