ASoC: topology: Fix wrong size check

Dan reported that smatch reports wrong size check and after analysis it
is confirmed that we are comparing wrong value: pointer size instead of
array size. However the check itself is problematic as in UAPI header
there are two fields:

struct snd_soc_tplg_enum_control {
    (...)
    char texts[SND_SOC_TPLG_NUM_TEXTS][SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_ID_NAME_MAXLEN];
    __le32 values[SND_SOC_TPLG_NUM_TEXTS * SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_ID_NAME_MAXLEN / 4];

the texts field is for names and the values one for values assigned to
those named fields, after analysis it becomes clear that there is quite
a lot overhead values than we may possibly name. So instead of changing
check to ARRAY_SIZE(ec->values), as it was first suggested, use
hardcoded value of SND_SOC_TPLG_NUM_TEXTS.
