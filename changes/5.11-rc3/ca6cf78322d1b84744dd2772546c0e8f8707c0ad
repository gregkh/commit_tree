fbdev: sbuslib: remove compat_alloc_user_space usage

This is one of the last users of compat_alloc_user_space()
and copy_in_user(). The actual handler is implemented in the
same file and could be shared, but as I couldn't test this
properly I leave the native case alone and just make a straight
copy of it for the compat case, with a minimum set of
modifications.
