slimbus: qcom-ngd-ctrl: Constify static structs

qcom_slim_qmi_msg_handlers[] and qcom_slim_ngd_qmi_svc_event_ops are
only used as input arguments to qmi_handle_init() which accepts const
pointers to both qmi_ops and qmi_msg_handler. Make them const to allow
the compiler to put them in read-only memory.
