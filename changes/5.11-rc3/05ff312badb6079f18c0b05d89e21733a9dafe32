ASoC: Intel: byt/cht: set pm ops dynamically

The Atom/SST driver does not rely on ASoC power management, but the
SOF driver does. Rather than using a hard-coded build-time assignment,
we can set this pm_ops dynamically depending on what the parent
is. That will remove the last build-time dependency and allow for
coexistence of both SST and SOF drivers for Baytrail/Cherrytrail.
