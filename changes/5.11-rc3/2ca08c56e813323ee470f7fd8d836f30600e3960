btrfs: explicitly protect ->last_byte_to_unpin in unpin_extent_range

Currently unpin_extent_range happens in the transaction commit context,
so we are protected from ->last_byte_to_unpin changing while we're
unpinning, because any new transactions would have to wait for us to
complete before modifying ->last_byte_to_unpin.

However in the future we may want to change how this works, for instance
with async unpinning or other such TODO items.  To prepare for that
future explicitly protect ->last_byte_to_unpin with the commit_root_sem
so we are sure it won't change while we're doing our work.
