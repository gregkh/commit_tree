null_blk: Fix zone size initialization

For a null_blk device with zoned mode enabled is currently initialized
with a number of zones equal to the device capacity divided by the zone
size, without considering if the device capacity is a multiple of the
zone size. If the zone size is not a divisor of the capacity, the zones
end up not covering the entire capacity, potentially resulting is out
of bounds accesses to the zone array.

Fix this by adding one last smaller zone with a size equal to the
remainder of the disk capacity divided by the zone size if the capacity
is not a multiple of the zone size. For such smaller last zone, the zone
capacity is also checked so that it does not exceed the smaller zone
size.
