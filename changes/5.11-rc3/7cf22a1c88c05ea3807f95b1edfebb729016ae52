selftests/vm: fix building protection keys test

Commit d8cbe8bfa7d ("tools/testing/selftests/vm: fix build error") tried
to include a ARCH check for powerpc, however ARCH is not defined in the
Makefile before including lib.mk.  This makes test building to skip on
both x86 and powerpc.

Fix the arch check by replacing it using machine type as it is already
defined and used in the test.
