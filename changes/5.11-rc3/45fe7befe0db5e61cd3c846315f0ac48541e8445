coresight: remove broken __exit annotations

Functions that are annotated __exit are discarded for built-in drivers,
but the .remove callback in a device driver must still be kept around
to allow bind/unbind operations.

There is now a linker warning for the discarded symbol references:

`tmc_remove' referenced in section `.data' of drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-tmc-core.o: defined in discarded section `.exit.text' of drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-tmc-core.o

Remove all those annotations.
