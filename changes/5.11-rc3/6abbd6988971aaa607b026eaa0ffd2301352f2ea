irqchip/gic, gic-v3: Make SGIs use handle_percpu_devid_irq()

handle_percpu_devid_fasteoi_ipi() states:

 * The biggest difference with the IRQ version is that the interrupt is
 * EOIed early, as the IPI could result in a context switch, and we need to
 * make sure the IPI can fire again

All that can actually happen scheduler-wise within the handling of an IPI
is the raising of TIF_NEED_RESCHED (and / or folding thereof into
preempt_count); see scheduler_ipi() or sched_ttwu_pending() for instance.

Said flag / preempt_count is evaluated some time later before returning to
whatever context was interrupted, and this gates a call to
preempt_schedule_irq() (arm64_preempt_schedule_irq() in arm64).

Per the above, SGI's do not need a different handler than PPI's, so make
them use the same (handle_percpu_devid_irq).
