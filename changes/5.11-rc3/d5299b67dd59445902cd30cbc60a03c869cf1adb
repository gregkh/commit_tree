bpf: Memcg-based memory accounting for bpf maps

This patch enables memcg-based memory accounting for memory allocated
by __bpf_map_area_alloc(), which is used by many types of bpf maps for
large initial memory allocations.

Please note, that __bpf_map_area_alloc() should not be used outside of
map creation paths without setting the active memory cgroup to the
map's memory cgroup.

Following patches in the series will refine the accounting for
some of the map types.
