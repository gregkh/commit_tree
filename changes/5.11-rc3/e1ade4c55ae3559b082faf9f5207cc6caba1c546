ASoc: adi: Kconfig: Remove depends on for ADI reference designs

Audio ADI reference designs are also used on some ZynqMP boards, and can
also be used on Intel FPGA boards and also on some more complex FPGA
combinations (FPGA cards connected through PCIe).

This change removes the dependency on Microblaze and Zynq architectures
to allow the usage of this driver for the systems described above.
