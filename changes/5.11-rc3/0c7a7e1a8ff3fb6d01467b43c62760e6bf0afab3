kunit: kunit_tool: Correctly parse diagnostic messages

Currently, kunit_tool expects all diagnostic lines in test results to
contain ": " somewhere, as both the subtest header and the crash report
do. Fix this to accept any line starting with (minus indent) "# " as
being a valid diagnostic line.

This matches what the TAP spec[1] and the draft KTAP spec[2] are
expecting.
