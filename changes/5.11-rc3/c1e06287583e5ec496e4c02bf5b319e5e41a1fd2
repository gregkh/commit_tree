torture: Force weak-hashed pointers on console log

Although the rcutorture scripting now deals correctly with full-up
security-induced pointer obfuscation, it is still counter-productive for
kernel hackers who are analyzing console output.  This commit therefore
sets the debug_boot_weak_hash kernel boot parameter, which enables
printing of weak-hashed pointers for torture-test runs.

Please note that this change applies only to runs initiated by the
kvm.sh scripting.  If you are instead using modprobe and rmmod, it is
your responsibility to build and boot the underlying kernel to your taste.

Please note further that this change does not result in a security hole
in normal use.  The rcutorture testing runs with a negligible userspace,
no networking, and no user interaction.  Besides which, there is no data
of value that can be extracted from an rcutorture guest OS that could
not also be extracted from the host that this guest is running on.
