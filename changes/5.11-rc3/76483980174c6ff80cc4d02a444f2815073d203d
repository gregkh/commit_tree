octeontx2-af: Fix access of iter->entry after iter object has been kfree'd

The call to pc_delete_flow can kfree the iter object, so the following
dev_err message that accesses iter->entry can accessmemory that has
just been kfree'd.  Fix this by adding a temporary variable 'entry'
that has a copy of iter->entry and also use this when indexing into
the array mcam->entry2target_pffunc[]. Also print the unsigned value
using the %u format specifier rather than %d.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Read from pointer after free")
