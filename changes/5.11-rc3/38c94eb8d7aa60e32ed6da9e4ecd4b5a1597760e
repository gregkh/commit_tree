media: ccs-pll: Check for derating and overrating, support non-derating sensors

Some sensors support derating (VT domain speed faster than OP) or
overrating (VT domain speed slower than OP). While this was supported for
the driver, the hardware support for the feature was never verified. Do
that now, and for those devices without that support, VT and OP speeds
have to match.
