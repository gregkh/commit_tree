file: Merge __fd_install into fd_install

The function __fd_install was added to support binder[1].  With binder
fixed[2] there are no more users.

As fd_install just calls __fd_install with "files=current->files",
merge them together by transforming the files parameter into a
local variable initialized to current->files.
