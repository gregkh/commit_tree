btrfs: introduce ZONED feature flag

This patch introduces the ZONED incompat flag. The flag indicates that
the volume management will satisfy the constraints imposed by
host-managed zoned block devices (aligned chunk allocation, append-only
updates, reset zone after filled).

As the zoned support will happen incrementally due to enhancing some
core infrastructure like super block writes, tree-log, raid support, the
feature will appear in sysfs only on debug builds. It will be enabled
once the support is feature complete and applications can reliably check
whether zoned support is present or not.
