parisc: use legacy_timer_tick

parisc has selected CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS since commit 43b1f6abd590
("parisc: Switch to generic sched_clock implementation"), but does not
appear to actually be using it, and instead calls the low-level
timekeeping functions directly.

Remove the GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS select again, and instead convert to
the newly added legacy_timer_tick() helper.
