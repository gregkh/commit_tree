drm/shmem-helper: Use cached mappings by default

SHMEM-buffer backing storage is allocated from system memory; which is
typically cachable. The default mode for SHMEM objects is writecombine
though.

Unify SHMEM semantics by defaulting to cached mappings. The exception
is pages imported via dma-buf. DMA memory is usually not cached.

DRM drivers that require write-combined mappings set the map_wc flag
in struct drm_gem_shmem_object to true. This currently affects lima,
panfrost and v3d.

The drivers mgag200, udl, virtio and vkms continue to use default
shmem mappings.

The drivers cirrus and gm12u320 change caching flags. Both used
writecombine and now switch over to shmem defaults. Both drivers use
SHMEM objects as shadow buffers for internal video memory, so cached
mappings will not affect them negatively.

v3:
	* set value of shmem pointer before dereferencing it in
	  __drm_gem_shmem_create() (Dan, kernel test robot)
v2:
	* recreate patch on top of latest SHMEM helpers
	* update lima, panfrost, v3d to select writecombine (Daniel, Rob)
