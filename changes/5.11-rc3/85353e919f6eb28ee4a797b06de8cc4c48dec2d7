ep_insert(): we only need tep->mtx around the insertion itself

We do need ep->mtx (and we are holding it all along), but that's
the lock on the epoll we are inserting into; locking of the
epoll being inserted is not needed for most of that work -
as the matter of fact, we only need it to provide barriers
for the fastpath check (for now).

Move taking and releasing it into ep_insert().  The caller
(do_epoll_ctl()) doesn't need to bother with that at all.
Moreover, that way we kill the kludge in ep_item_poll() - now
it's always called with tep unlocked.
