dt-bindings:iio:samsung, exynos-adc: drop missuse of io-channel-ranges

io-channel-ranges is a property for consumers of io-channels, not
providers.  Hence it is not relevant in this binding or the examples
given.

Recent changes to dt-schema result in this being reported as an error
as a dependency is enforced between this property and io-channels.
