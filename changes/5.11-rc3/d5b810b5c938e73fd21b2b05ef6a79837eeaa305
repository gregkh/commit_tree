powerpc/book3s64/kuap: Rename MMU_FTR_RADIX_KUAP and MMU_FTR_KUEP

This is in preparation to adding support for kuap with hash translation.
In preparation for that rename/move kuap related functions to
non radix names. Also move the feature bit closer to MMU_FTR_KUEP.

MMU_FTR_KUEP is renamed to MMU_FTR_BOOK3S_KUEP to indicate the feature
is only relevant to BOOK3S_64
