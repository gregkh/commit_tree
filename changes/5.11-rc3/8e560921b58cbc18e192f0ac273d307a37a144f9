powerpc/book3s64/pkeys: Store/restore userspace AMR/IAMR correctly on entry and exit from kernel

This prepare kernel to operate with a different value than userspace AMR/IAMR.
For this, AMR/IAMR need to be saved and restored on entry and return from the
kernel.

With KUAP we modify kernel AMR when accessing user address from the kernel
via copy_to/from_user interfaces. We don't need to modify IAMR value in
similar fashion.

If MMU_FTR_PKEY is enabled we need to save AMR/IAMR in pt_regs on entering
kernel from userspace. If not we can assume that AMR/IAMR is not modified
from userspace.

We need to save AMR if we have MMU_FTR_BOOK3S_KUAP feature enabled and we are
interrupted within kernel. This is required so that if we get interrupted
within copy_to/from_user we continue with the right AMR value.

If we hae MMU_FTR_BOOK3S_KUEP enabled we need to restore IAMR on
return to userspace beause kernel will be running with a different
IAMR value.
