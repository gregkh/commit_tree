ftrace: Have the callbacks receive a struct ftrace_regs instead of pt_regs

In preparation to have arguments of a function passed to callbacks attached
to functions as default, change the default callback prototype to receive a
struct ftrace_regs as the forth parameter instead of a pt_regs.

For callbacks that set the FL_SAVE_REGS flag in their ftrace_ops flags, they
will now need to get the pt_regs via a ftrace_get_regs() helper call. If
this is called by a callback that their ftrace_ops did not have a
FL_SAVE_REGS flag set, it that helper function will return NULL.

This will allow the ftrace_regs to hold enough just to get the parameters
and stack pointer, but without the worry that callbacks may have a pt_regs
that is not completely filled.
