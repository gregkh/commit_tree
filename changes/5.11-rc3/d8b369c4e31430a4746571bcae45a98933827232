KVM: arm64: Add kvm-arm.mode early kernel parameter

Add an early parameter that allows users to select the mode of operation
for KVM/arm64.

For now, the only supported value is "protected". By passing this flag
users opt into the hypervisor placing additional restrictions on the
host kernel. These allow the hypervisor to spawn guests whose state is
kept private from the host. Restrictions will include stage-2 address
translation to prevent host from accessing guest memory, filtering its
SMC calls, etc.

Without this parameter, the default behaviour remains selecting VHE/nVHE
based on hardware support and CONFIG_ARM64_VHE.
