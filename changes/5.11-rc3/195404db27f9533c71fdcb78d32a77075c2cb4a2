crypto: talitos - Endianess in current_desc_hdr()

current_desc_hdr() compares the value of the current descriptor
with the next_desc member of the talitos_desc struct.

While the current descriptor is obtained from in_be32() which
return CPU ordered bytes, next_desc member is in big endian order.

Convert the current descriptor into big endian before comparing it
with next_desc.

This fixes a sparse warning.
