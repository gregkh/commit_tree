powerpc/rtas: prevent suspend-related sys_rtas use on LE

While drmgr has had work in some areas to make its RTAS syscall
interactions endian-neutral, its code for performing partition
migration via the syscall has never worked on LE. While it is able to
complete ibm,suspend-me successfully, it crashes when attempting the
subsequent ibm,update-nodes call.

drmgr is the only known (or plausible) user of ibm,suspend-me,
ibm,update-nodes, and ibm,update-properties, so allow them only in
big-endian configurations.
