MIPS: Loongson64: SMP: Fix up play_dead jump indicator

In play_dead function, the whole 64-bit PC mailbox was used as a indicator
to determine if the master core had written boot jump information.

However, after we introduced CSR mailsend, the hardware will not guarante
an atomic write for the 64-bit PC mailbox. Thus we have to use the lower
32-bit which is written at the last as the jump indicator instead.
