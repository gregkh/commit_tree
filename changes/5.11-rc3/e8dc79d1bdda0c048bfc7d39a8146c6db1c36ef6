dm crypt: Constify static crypt_iv_operations

The only usage of these structs is to assign their address to the
iv_gen_ops field in the crypt config struct, which is a pointer to
const. Make them const like the rest of the static crypt_iv_operations
structs. This allows the compiler to put them in read-only memory.
