libbpf: Fix BTF data layout checks and allow empty BTF

Make data section layout checks stricter, disallowing overlap of types and
strings data.

Additionally, allow BTFs with no type data. There is nothing inherently wrong
with having BTF with no types (put potentially with some strings). This could
be a situation with kernel module BTFs, if module doesn't introduce any new
type information.

Also fix invalid offset alignment check for btf->hdr->type_off.
