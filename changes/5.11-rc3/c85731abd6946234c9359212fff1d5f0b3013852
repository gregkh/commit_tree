arm64: dts: hisilicon: list all clocks required by spi-pl022.yaml

The arm,pl022 binding need to specify two clocks: "sspclk", "apb_pclk".
But only "apb_pclk" is specified now. Because the driver preferentially
matches the first clock. Otherwise, it matches the second clock instead
of both clocks. So both of them use the same clock don't change the
function.
