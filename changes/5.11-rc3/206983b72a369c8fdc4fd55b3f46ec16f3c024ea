btrfs: use btrfs_read_node_slot in btrfs_realloc_node

We have this open-coded nightmare in btrfs_realloc_node that does
the same thing that the normal read path does, which is to see if we
have the eb in memory already, and if not read it, and verify the eb is
uptodate.  Delete this open coding and simply use btrfs_read_node_slot.
