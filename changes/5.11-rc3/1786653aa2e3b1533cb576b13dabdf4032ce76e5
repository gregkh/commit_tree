media: camss: vfe-4-7: Rename get_ub_size, set_qos, set_ds, wm_enable

In preparation to add support for VFE 4.8, rename these functions
by adding the vfe version that they are referred to (for example,
vfe_get_ub_size -> vfe47_get_ub_size), as these are the only ones
that will be different for the VFE version 4.8.
