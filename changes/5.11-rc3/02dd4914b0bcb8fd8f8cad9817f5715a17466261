scsi: target: Fix cmd_count ref leak

percpu_ref_init sets the refcount to 1 and percpu_ref_kill drops it.
Drivers like iSCSI and loop do not call target_sess_cmd_list_set_waiting
during session shutdown, though, so they have been calling percpu_ref_exit
with a refcount still taken and leaking the cmd_counts memory.
