KVM: arm64: Keep nVHE EL2 vector installed

KVM by default keeps the stub vector installed and installs the nVHE
vector only briefly for init and later on demand. Change this policy
to install the vector at init and then never uninstall it if the kernel
was given the protected KVM command line parameter.
