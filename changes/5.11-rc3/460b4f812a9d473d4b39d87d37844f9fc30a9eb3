file: Rename fcheck lookup_fd_rcu

Also remove the confusing comment about checking if a fd exists.  I
could not find one instance in the entire kernel that still matches
the description or the reason for the name fcheck.

The need for better names became apparent in the last round of
discussion of this set of changes[1].
