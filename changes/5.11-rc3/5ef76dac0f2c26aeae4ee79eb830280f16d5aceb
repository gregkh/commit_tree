spi: st-ssc4: Fix unbalanced pm_runtime_disable() in probe error path

If the calls to devm_platform_ioremap_resource(), irq_of_parse_and_map()
or devm_request_irq() fail on probe of the ST SSC4 SPI driver, the
runtime PM disable depth is incremented even though it was not
decremented before.  Fix it.
