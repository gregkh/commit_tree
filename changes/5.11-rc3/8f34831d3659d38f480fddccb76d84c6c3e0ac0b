arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: limit IPA iommu streams

Recently we learned that Android and Windows firmware don't seem to
like using 3 as an iommu mask value for IPA.  A simple fix was to
specify exactly the streams needed explicitly, rather than implying
a range with the mask.  Make the same change for the SC7180 platform.
