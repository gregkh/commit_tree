cppc_cpufreq: clarify support for coordination types

The previous coordination type handling in the cppc_cpufreq init code
created some confusion: the comment mentioned "Support only SW_ANY for
now" while only the SW_ALL/ALL case resulted in a failure. The other
coordination types (HW_ALL/HW, NONE) were silently supported.

Clarify support for coordination types while describing in comments the
intended behavior.
