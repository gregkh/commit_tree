security: add const qualifier to struct sock in various places

A followup change to tcp_request_sock_op would have to drop the 'const'
qualifier from the 'route_req' function as the
'security_inet_conn_request' call is moved there - and that function
expects a 'struct sock *'.

However, it turns out its also possible to add a const qualifier to
security_inet_conn_request instead.
