ARM: dts: exynos: Add interconnects to Exynos4412 mixer

This patch adds an 'interconnects' property to Exynos4412 DTS in order to
declare the interconnect path used by the mixer. Please note that the
'interconnect-names' property is not needed when there is only one path in
'interconnects', in which case calling of_icc_get() with a NULL name simply
returns the right path.
