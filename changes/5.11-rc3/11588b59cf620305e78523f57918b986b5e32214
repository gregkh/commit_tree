auxdisplay: Move addr out of charlcd_priv

Move out the struct addr from struct charlcd_priv into the less private
struct charlcd. This member is used to pass position information. The
individual drivers need to be able to read this information, so we move
this out of charlcd_priv to charlcd structure.
