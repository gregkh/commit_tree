gpiolib: Use proper type for bias enumerator in gpio_set_bias()

First of all, bias has a special type as being a part of enum pin_config_param.
Second, 0 is also defined bias which is equivalent to BUS_HOLD.

Taking into account above, change type of bias variable and refactor
gpio_set_bias() in a way that it doesn't use BUS_HOLD as a place holder.
