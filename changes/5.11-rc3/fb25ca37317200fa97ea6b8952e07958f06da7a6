media: rcar-vin: Mask VNCSI_IFMD register

The VNCSI_IFMD register controls the data expansion mode and the
channel routing between the CSI-2 receivers and VIN instances.

According to the chip manual revision 2.20 not all fields are available
for all the SoCs:
- V3M, V3H and E3 do not support the DES1 field has they do not feature
  a CSI20 receiver.
- D3 only supports parallel input, and the whole register shall always
  be written as 0.

Inspect the per-SoC channel routing table where the available CSI-2
instances are reported and configure VNCSI_IFMD accordingly.

This patch supports this BSP change commit:
