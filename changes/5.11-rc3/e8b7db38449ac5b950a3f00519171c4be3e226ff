Drivers: hv: vmbus: Add vmbus_requestor data structure for VMBus hardening

Currently, VMbus drivers use pointers into guest memory as request IDs
for interactions with Hyper-V. To be more robust in the face of errors
or malicious behavior from a compromised Hyper-V, avoid exposing
guest memory addresses to Hyper-V. Also avoid Hyper-V giving back a
bad request ID that is then treated as the address of a guest data
structure with no validation. Instead, encapsulate these memory
addresses and provide small integers as request IDs.
