media: gspca: Fix memory leak in probe

The gspca driver leaks memory when a probe fails.  gspca_dev_probe2()
calls v4l2_device_register(), which takes a reference to the
underlying device node (in this case, a USB interface).  But the
failure pathway neglects to call v4l2_device_unregister(), the routine
responsible for dropping this reference.  Consequently the memory for
the USB interface and its device never gets released.

This patch adds the missing function call.
