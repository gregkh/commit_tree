ASoC: cx2072x: Fix doubly definitions of Playback and Capture streams

The cx2072x codec driver defines multiple DAIs with the same stream
name "Playback" and "Capture".  Although the current code works more
or less as is as the secondary streams are never used, it still leads
the error message like:
 debugfs: File 'Playback' in directory 'dapm' already present!
 debugfs: File 'Capture' in directory 'dapm' already present!

Fix it by renaming the secondary streams to unique names.
