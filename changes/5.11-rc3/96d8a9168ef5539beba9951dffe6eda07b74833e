This reverts commit cec72f3efc6272420c2c2c699607f03d09b93e41.

Commit cec72f3efc62 ("driver core: Don't do deferred probe in parallel
with kernel_init thread") was fixing a commit 716a7a259690 ("driver
core: fw_devlink: Add support for batching fwnode parsing"). Since the
commit being fixed itself is going to be reverted, the fix can also be
reverted.
