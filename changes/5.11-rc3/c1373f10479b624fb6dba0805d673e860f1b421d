xhci: Give USB2 ports time to enter U3 in bus suspend

If a USB2 device wakeup is not enabled/supported the link state may
still be in U0 in xhci_bus_suspend(), where it's then manually put
to suspended U3 state.

Just as with selective suspend the device needs time to enter U3
suspend before continuing with further suspend operations
(e.g. system suspend), otherwise we may enter system suspend with link
state in U0.
