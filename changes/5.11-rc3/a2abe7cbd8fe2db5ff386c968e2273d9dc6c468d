scs: switch to vmapped shadow stacks

The kernel currently uses kmem_cache to allocate shadow call stacks,
which means an overflows may not be immediately detected and can
potentially result in another task's shadow stack to be overwritten.

This change switches SCS to use virtually mapped shadow stacks for
tasks, which increases shadow stack size to a full page and provides
more robust overflow detection, similarly to VMAP_STACK.
