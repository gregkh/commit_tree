fs: dlm: listen socket out of connection hash

This patch introduces a own connection structure for the listen socket
handling instead of handling the listen socket as normal connection
structure in the connection hash. We can remove some nodeid equals zero
validation checks, because this nodeid should not exists anymore inside
the node hash. This patch also removes the sock mutex in
accept_from_sock() function because this function can't occur in another
parallel context if it's scheduled on only one workqueue.
