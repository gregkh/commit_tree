drm/amd/display: Add DSCL memory low power support

[Why]
The DSCL memory blocks should be powered down when they're not in use.
This will reduce power consumption.

[How]
1. Write to DSCL_MEM_PWR_FORCE to put memory to shutdown when DSCL is not
   used.
2. Added a debug option to allow this behaviour to be turned off
