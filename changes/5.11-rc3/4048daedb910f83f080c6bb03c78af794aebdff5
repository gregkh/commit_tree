btrfs: locking: remove the recursion handling code

Now that we're no longer using recursion, rip out all of the supporting
code.  Follow up patches will clean up the callers of these functions.

The extent_buffer::lock_owner is still retained as it allows safety
checks in btrfs_init_new_buffer for the case that the free space cache
is corrupted and we try to allocate a block that we are currently using
and have locked in the path.
