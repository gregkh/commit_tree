media: venus: put dummy vote on video-mem path after last session release

As per current implementation, video driver is unvoting "videom-mem" path
for last video session during vdec_session_release().
While video playback when we try to suspend device, we see video clock
warnings since votes are already removed during vdec_session_release().

corrected this by putting dummy vote on "video-mem" after last video
session release and unvoting it during suspend.
