um: Remove IRQ_NONE type

We don't actually use this in um_request_irq(), so it can
never be assigned. It's also not clear what that would be
useful for, so just remove it.

This results in quite a number of cleanups, all the way to
removing the "SIGIO on close" startup check, since the data
it assigns (pty_close_sigio) is not used anymore.

While at it, also make this an enum so we get a minimum of
type checking, and remove the IRQ_NONE hack in virtio since
we now no longer have the name twice.
