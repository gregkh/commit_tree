drm/msm/a6xx: Clear shadow on suspend

Clear the shadow rptr on suspend.  Otherwise, when we resume, we can
have a stale value until CP_WHERE_AM_I executes.  If we suspend near
the ringbuffer wraparound point, this can lead to a chicken/egg
situation where we are waiting for ringbuffer space to write the
CP_WHERE_AM_I (or CP_INIT) packet, because we mistakenly believe that
the ringbuffer is full (due to stale rptr value in the shadow).

Fixes errors like:

  [drm:adreno_wait_ring [msm]] *ERROR* timeout waiting for space in ringbuffer 0

in the resume path.
