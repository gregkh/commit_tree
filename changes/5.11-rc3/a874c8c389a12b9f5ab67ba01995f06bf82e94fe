selftests/bpf: Copy file using read/write in local storage test

Splice (copy_file_range) doesn't work on all filesystems. I'm running
test kernels on top of my read-only disk image and it uses plan9 under the
hood. This prevents test_local_storage from successfully passing.

There is really no technical reason to use splice, so lets do
old-school read/write to copy file; this should work in all
environments.
