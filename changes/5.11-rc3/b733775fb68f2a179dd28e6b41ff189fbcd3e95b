mmc: sunxi: drop of_match_ptr from of_device_id table

The driver can match only via DT table so it should be always used and
the of_match_ptr does not have any sense (this also allows ACPI
matching via PRP0001, even though it is not relevant for sunxi).  This
fixes compile warning:

    drivers/mmc/host/sunxi-mmc.c:1181:34: warning: ‘sunxi_mmc_of_match’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
