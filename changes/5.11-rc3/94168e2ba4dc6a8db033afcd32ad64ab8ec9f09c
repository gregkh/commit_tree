staging: mt7621-pinctrl: stop using the deprecated 'pinctrl_add_gpio_range'

If the gpio DT node has the 'gpio-ranges' property, the range will be
added by the gpio core and doesn't need to be added by the pinctrl
driver.

By having the gpio-ranges property, we can map every pin between
gpio node and pinctrl node and we can stop using the deprecated
pinctrl_add_gpio_range() function.
