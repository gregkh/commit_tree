drm/i915: Factor out a helper to disable the DPCD training pattern

To prepare for a follow-up LTTPR change factor out a helper to disable
the training pattern in DPCD. We'll need to do this for each LTTPR
(without programming the port to output the idle pattern) when training
in LTTPR non-transparent mode.

While at it also move the disable-link-training logic from
intel_dp_set_link_train() to intel_dp_stop_link_train(), since the
latter is the only user of this.

v2:
- Move the disable-link-training logic to intel_dp_stop_link_train()
