vdpa_sim: split vdpasim_virtqueue's iov field in out_iov and in_iov

vringh_getdesc_iotlb() manages 2 iovs for writable and readable
descriptors. This is very useful for the block device, where for
each request we have both types of descriptor.

Let's split the vdpasim_virtqueue's iov field in out_iov and
in_iov to use them with vringh_getdesc_iotlb().

We are using VIRTIO terminology for "out" (readable by the device)
and "in" (writable by the device) descriptors.
