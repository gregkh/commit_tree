arm64: mte: convert gcr_user into an exclude mask

The gcr_user mask is a per thread mask that represents the tags that are
excluded from random generation when the Memory Tagging Extension is
present and an 'irg' instruction is invoked.

gcr_user affects the behavior on EL0 only.

Currently that mask is an include mask and it is controlled by the user
via prctl() while GCR_EL1 accepts an exclude mask.

Convert the include mask into an exclude one to make it easier the
register setting.

Note: This change will affect gcr_kernel (for EL1) introduced with a
future patch.
