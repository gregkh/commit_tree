gve: Add support for raw addressing to the rx path

Add support to use raw dma addresses in the rx path. Due to this new
support we can alloc a new buffer instead of making a copy.

RX buffers are handed to the networking stack and are
re-allocated as needed, avoiding the need to use
skb_copy_to_linear_data() as in "qpl" mode.
