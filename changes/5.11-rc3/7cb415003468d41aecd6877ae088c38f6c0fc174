Fonts: Make font size unsigned in font_desc

`width` and `height` are defined as unsigned in our UAPI font descriptor
`struct console_font`. Make them unsigned in our kernel font descriptor
`struct font_desc`, too.

Also, change the corresponding printk() format identifiers from `%d` to
`%u`, in sti_select_fbfont().
