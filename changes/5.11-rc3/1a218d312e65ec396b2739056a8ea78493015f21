platform/mellanox: mlxbf-pmc: Add Mellanox BlueField PMC driver

The performance modules in BlueField are present in several hardware
blocks and each block provides access to these stats either through
counters that can be programmed to monitor supported events or
through memory-mapped registers that hold the relevant information.
The hardware blocks that include a performance module are:
 * Tile (block containing 2 cores and a shared L2 cache)
 * TRIO (PCIe root complex)
 * MSS (Memory Sub-system containing the Memory Controller and L3 cache)
 * GIC (Interrupt controller)
 * SMMU (System Memory Management Unit)
The mlx_pmc driver provides access to all of these performance modules
through a hwmon sysfs interface.
