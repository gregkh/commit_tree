net/mlx5e: In skb build skip setting mark in switchdev mode

sop_drop_qpn field in the cqe is used by two features, in SWITCHDEV mode
to restore the chain id in case of a miss and in LEGACY mode to support
skbedit mark action. In build RX skb, the skb mark field is set regardless
of the configured mode which cause a corruption of the mark field in case
of switchdev mode.

Fix by overriding the mark value back to 0 in the representor tc update
skb flow.
