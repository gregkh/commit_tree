drm/i915: Fix DP link training pattern mask

An LTTPR can be trained with training pattern 4 even if the DPCD
revision is < 1.4, but drm_dp_training_pattern_mask() would change
pattern 4 to pattern 3 on those DPCD revisions.

Since intel_dp_training_pattern() makes already sure that the proper
training pattern is used, all that needs to be masked out is the
scrambling disable flag, which is or'd to the mask later based on the
training pattern.

v2:
- Use a helper instead of open-coding the masking. (Ville)
