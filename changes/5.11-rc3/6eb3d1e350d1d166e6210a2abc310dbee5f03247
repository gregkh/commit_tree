mptcp: unify ADD_ADDR and echo suboptions writing

There are two differences between ADD_ADDR suboption and ADD_ADDR echo
suboption: The length of the former is 8 octets longer than the length
of the latter. The former's echo-flag is 0, and latter's echo-flag is 1.

This patch added two local variables, len and echo, to unify ADD_ADDR
and ADD_ADDR echo suboptions writing.
