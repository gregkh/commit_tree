Revert "i2c: i2c-qcom-geni: Fix DMA transfer race"

This reverts commit 02b9aec59243c6240fc42884acc958602146ddf6.

As talked about in the patch ("soc: qcom: geni: More properly switch
to DMA mode"), swapping the order of geni_se_setup_m_cmd() and
geni_se_xx_dma_prep() can sometimes cause corrupted transfers.  Thus
we traded one problem for another.  Now that we've debugged the
problem further and fixed the geni helper functions to more disable
FIFO interrupts when we move to DMA mode we can revert it and end up
with (hopefully) zero problems!

To be explicit, the patch ("soc: qcom: geni: More properly switch
to DMA mode") is a prerequisite for this one.
