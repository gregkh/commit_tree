btrfs: introduce mount option rescue=all

Now that we have the building blocks for some better recovery options
with corrupted file systems, add a rescue=all option to enable all of
the relevant rescue options.  This will allow distros to simply default
to rescue=all for the "oh dear lord the world's on fire" recovery
without needing to know all the different options that we have and may
add in the future.
