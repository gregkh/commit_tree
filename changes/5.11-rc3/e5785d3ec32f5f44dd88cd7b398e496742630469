scsi: lpfc: Re-fix use after free in lpfc_rq_buf_free()

Commit 9816ef6ecbc1 ("scsi: lpfc: Use after free in lpfc_rq_buf_free()")
was made to correct a use after free condition in lpfc_rq_buf_free().
Unfortunately, a subsequent patch cut on a tree without the fix
inadvertently reverted the fix.

Put the fix back: Move the freeing of the rqb_entry to after the print
function that references it.
