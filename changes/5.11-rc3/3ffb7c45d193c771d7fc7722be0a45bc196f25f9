gpiolib: cdev: document that line eflags are shared

The line.eflags field is shared so document this fact and highlight it
throughout using READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() accessors.

Also use a local copy of the eflags in edge_irq_thread() to ensure
consistent control flow even if eflags changes.  This is only a defensive
measure as edge_irq_thread() is currently disabled when the eflags are
changed.
