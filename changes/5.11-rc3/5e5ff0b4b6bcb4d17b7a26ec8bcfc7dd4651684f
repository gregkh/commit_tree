USB: cdc-wdm: Fix use after free in service_outstanding_interrupt().

syzbot is reporting UAF at usb_submit_urb() [1], for
service_outstanding_interrupt() is not checking WDM_DISCONNECTING
before calling usb_submit_urb(). Close the race by doing same checks
wdm_read() does upon retry.

Also, while wdm_read() checks WDM_DISCONNECTING with desc->rlock held,
service_interrupt_work() does not hold desc->rlock. Thus, it is possible
that usb_submit_urb() is called from service_outstanding_interrupt() from
service_interrupt_work() after WDM_DISCONNECTING was set and kill_urbs()
 from wdm_disconnect() completed. Thus, move kill_urbs() in
wdm_disconnect() to after cancel_work_sync() (which makes sure that
service_interrupt_work() is no longer running) completed.

Although it seems to be safe to dereference desc->intf->dev in
service_outstanding_interrupt() even if WDM_DISCONNECTING was already set
because desc->rlock or cancel_work_sync() prevents wdm_disconnect() from
reaching list_del() before service_outstanding_interrupt() completes,
let's not emit error message if WDM_DISCONNECTING is set by
wdm_disconnect() while usb_submit_urb() is in progress.
