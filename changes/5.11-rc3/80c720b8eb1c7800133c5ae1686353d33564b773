xfs: define a new "needrepair" feature

Define an incompat feature flag to indicate that the filesystem needs to
be repaired.  While libxfs will recognize this feature, the kernel will
refuse to mount if the feature flag is set, and only xfs_repair will be
able to clear the flag.  The goal here is to force the admin to run
xfs_repair to completion after upgrading the filesystem, or if we
otherwise detect anomalies.
