genirq/affinity: Add irq_update_affinity_desc()

Add a function to allow the affinity of an interrupt be switched to
managed, such that interrupts allocated for platform devices may be
managed.

This new interface has certain limitations, and attempts to use it in the
following circumstances will fail:
- For when the kernel is configured for generic IRQ reservation mode (in
  config GENERIC_IRQ_RESERVATION_MODE). The reason being that it could
  conflict with managed vs. non-managed interrupt accounting.
- The interrupt is already started, which should not be the case during
  init
- The interrupt is already configured as managed, which means double init
