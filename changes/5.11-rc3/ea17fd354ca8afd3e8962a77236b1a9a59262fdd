null_blk: Allow controlling max_hw_sectors limit

Add the module option and configfs attribute max_sectors to allow
configuring the maximum size of a command issued to a null_blk device.
This allows exercising the block layer BIO splitting with different
limits than the default BLK_SAFE_MAX_SECTORS. This is also useful for
testing the zone append write path of file systems as the max_hw_sectors
limit value is also used for the max_zone_append_sectors limit.
