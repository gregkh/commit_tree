mtd: rawnand: qcom: Add NAND controller support for SDX55

SDX55 uses QPIC version 2.0.0 IP for the NAND controller support.
In this version, DEV_CMD_* registers are moved to operational state,
hence CPU access in BAM mode is restricted. So, skip accessing these
registers and also use a different config for reading ONFI parameters.
