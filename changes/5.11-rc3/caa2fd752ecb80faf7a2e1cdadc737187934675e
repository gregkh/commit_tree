clk: rockchip: fix i2s gate bits on rk3066 and rk3188

The Rockchip PX2/RK3066 uses these bits in CRU_CLKGATE7_CON:

hclk_i2s_8ch_gate_en  bit 4 (dtsi: i2s0)
hclk_i2s0_2ch_gate_en bit 2 (dtsi: i2s1)
hclk_i2s1_2ch_gate_en bit 3 (dtsi: i2s2)

The Rockchip PX3/RK3188 uses this bit in CRU_CLKGATE7_CON:

hclk_i2s_2ch_gate_en  bit 2 (dtsi: i2s0)

The bits got somehow mixed up in the clk-rk3188.c file.
The labels in the dtsi files are not suppose to change.
The sclk and hclk names should match for
"trace_event=clk_disable,clk_enable",
so remove GATE HCLK_I2S0 from the common clock tree and
fix the bits in the rk3066 and rk3188 clock tree.
