KVM: arm64: Remove vector_ptr param of hyp-init

KVM precomputes the hyp VA of __kvm_hyp_host_vector, essentially a
constant (minus ASLR), before passing it to __kvm_hyp_init.
Now that we have alternatives for converting kimg VA to hyp VA, replace
this with computing the constant inside __kvm_hyp_init, thus removing
the need for an argument.
