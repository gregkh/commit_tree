sched/fair: Clear SMT siblings after determining the core is not idle

The clearing of SMT siblings from the SIS mask before checking for an idle
core is a small but unnecessary cost. Defer the clearing of the siblings
until the scan moves to the next potential target. The cost of this was
not measured as it is borderline noise but it should be self-evident.
