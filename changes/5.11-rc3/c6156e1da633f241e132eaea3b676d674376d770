entry: Add syscall_exit_to_user_mode_work()

This is the same as syscall_exit_to_user_mode() but without calling
exit_to_user_mode(). This can be used if there is an architectural reason
to avoid the combo function, e.g. restarting a syscall without returning to
userspace. Before returning to user space the caller has to invoke
exit_to_user_mode().
