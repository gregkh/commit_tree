i40e: Fix Error I40E_AQ_RC_EINVAL when removing VFs

When removing VFs for PF added to bridge there was
an error I40E_AQ_RC_EINVAL. It was caused by not properly
resetting and reinitializing PF when adding/removing VFs.
Changed how reset is performed when adding/removing VFs
to properly reinitialize PFs VSI.
