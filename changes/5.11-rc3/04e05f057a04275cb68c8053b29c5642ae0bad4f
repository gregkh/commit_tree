KVM: arm64: Add function to enter host from KVM nVHE hyp code

All nVHE hyp code is currently executed as handlers of host's HVCs. This
will change as nVHE starts intercepting host's PSCI CPU_ON SMCs. The
newly booted CPU will need to initialize EL2 state and then enter the
host. Add __host_enter function that branches into the existing
host state-restoring code after the trap handler would have returned.
