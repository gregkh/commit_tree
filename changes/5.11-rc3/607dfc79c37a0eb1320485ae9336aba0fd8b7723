cifs: remove various function description warnings

When compiling with W=1 I noticed various functions that
did not follow proper style in describing (in the comments)
the parameters passed in to the function. For example:

fs/cifs/inode.c:2236: warning: Function parameter or member 'mode' not described in 'cifs_wait_bit_killable'

I did not address the style warnings in two of the six files
(connect.c and misc.c) in order to reduce risk of merge
conflict with pending patches. We can update those later.
