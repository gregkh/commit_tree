bpf: Refactor check_cfg to use a structured loop.

The current implementation uses a number of gotos to implement a loop
and different paths within the loop, which makes the code less readable
than it would be with an explicit while-loop. This patch also replaces a
chain of if/if-elses keyed on the same expression with a switch
statement.

No change in behaviour is intended.
