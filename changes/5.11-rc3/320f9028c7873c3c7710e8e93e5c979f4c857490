USB: serial: keyspan_pda: fix write unthrottling

The driver did not update its view of the available device buffer space
until write() was called in task context. This meant that write_room()
would return 0 even after the device had sent a write-unthrottle
notification, something which could lead to blocked writers not being
woken up (e.g. when using OPOST).

Note that we must also request an unthrottle notification is case a
write() request fills the device buffer exactly.
