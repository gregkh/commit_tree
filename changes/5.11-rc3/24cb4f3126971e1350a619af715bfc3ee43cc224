drm/i915: Reduce severity for fixing up mistaken VBT tc->legacy_port

If the VBT assigned tc->legacy_port mismatches the live_status indicator
for the connector, we ignore the VBT directive and switch over to the HW
setting. This is not a driver error, unless we happen to misparse the
VBT or the live_status registers. However, for the system in CI where
the error is only reported on 1 port out of 4, the evidence indicates
the VBT is wrong. Stop flaging this as an error since the cause is
beyond our control, fixup the mistake and continue on.
