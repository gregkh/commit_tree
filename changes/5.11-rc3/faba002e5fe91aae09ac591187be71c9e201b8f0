ALSA: hda/ca0132: Move unsol callback setups to parser

The setup of unsolicited event callbacks should be done only once at
the parser phase, not in the init phase that is called multiple times
at each resume.

This patch moves the unsol setup code in ca0132 codec driver to the
more appropriate place.
