x86/ioapic: Use I/O-APIC ID for finding irqdomain, not index

In commit b643128b917 ("x86/ioapic: Use irq_find_matching_fwspec() to
find remapping irqdomain") the I/O-APIC code was changed to find its
parent irqdomain using irq_find_matching_fwspec(), but the key used
for the lookup was wrong. It shouldn't use 'ioapic' which is the index
into its own ioapics[] array. It should use the actual arbitration
ID of the I/O-APIC in question, which is mpc_ioapic_id(ioapic).
