phy: ralink: phy-mt7621-pci: drop 'COMPILE_TEST' from Kconfig

This driver includes the following two files directly:
- mt7621.h
- ralink_regs.h

Compilation for its related platform properly works because
its real path is included in 'arch/mips/ralink/Platform' as
cflags.

This driver depends on RALINK but also is enabled for COMPILE_TEST
where nothing about its platform is known and this directly
included files are not found at all breaking compilation.

If we want 'COMPILE_TEST' we have to change cflags also inside
'phy/ralink' subdirectory Makefile which seems that does not
like to linux-phy maintainers. Hence remove COMPILE_TEST from
Kconfig to avoid the problem.
