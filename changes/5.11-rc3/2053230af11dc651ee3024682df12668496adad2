PCI/MSI: Set device flag indicating only 32-bit MSI support

The MSI-X Capability requires devices to support 64-bit Message Addresses,
but the MSI Capability can support either 32- or 64-bit addresses.

Previously, we set dev->no_64bit_msi for a few broken devices that
advertise 64-bit MSI support but don't correctly support it.

In addition, check the MSI "64-bit Address Capable" bit for all devices and
set dev->no_64bit_msi for devices that don't advertise 64-bit support.
This allows msi_verify_entries() to catch arch code defects that assign
64-bit addresses when they're not supported.

The warning is helpful to find defects like the one fixed by
