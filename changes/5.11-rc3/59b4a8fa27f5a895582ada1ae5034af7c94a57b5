CDC-NCM: remove "connected" log message

The cdc_ncm driver passes network connection notifications up to
usbnet_link_change(), which is the right place for any logging.
Remove the netdev_info() duplicating this from the driver itself.

This stops devices such as my "TRENDnet USB 10/100/1G/2.5G LAN"
(ID 20f4:e02b) adapter from spamming the kernel log with

    cdc_ncm 2-2:2.0 enp0s2u2c2: network connection: connected

messages every 60 msec or so.
