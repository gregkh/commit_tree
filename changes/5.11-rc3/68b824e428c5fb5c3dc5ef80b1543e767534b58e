KVM: arm64: Patch kimage_voffset instead of loading the EL1 value

Directly using the kimage_voffset variable is fine for now, but
will become more problematic as we start distrusting EL1.

Instead, patch the kimage_voffset into the HYP text, ensuring
we don't have to load an untrusted value later on.
