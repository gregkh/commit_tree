scsi: lpfc: Fix pointer defereference before it is null checked issue

There is a null check on pointer lpfc_cmd after the pointer has been
dereferenced when pointers rdata and ndlp are initialized at the start of
the function. Fix this by only assigning rdata and ndlp after the pointer
lpfc_cmd has been null checked.
