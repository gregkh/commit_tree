libbpf: Support modules in bpf_program__set_attach_target() API

Support finding kernel targets in kernel modules when using
bpf_program__set_attach_target() API. This brings it up to par with what
libbpf supports when doing declarative SEC()-based target determination.

Some minor internal refactoring was needed to make sure vmlinux BTF can be
loaded before bpf_object's load phase.
