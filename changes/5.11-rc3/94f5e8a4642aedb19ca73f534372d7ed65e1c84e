KVM: arm64: Create nVHE copy of cpu_logical_map

When KVM starts validating host's PSCI requests, it will need to map
MPIDR back to the CPU ID. To this end, copy cpu_logical_map into nVHE
hyp memory when KVM is initialized.

Only copy the information for CPUs that are online at the point of KVM
initialization so that KVM rejects CPUs whose features were not checked
against the finalized capabilities.
