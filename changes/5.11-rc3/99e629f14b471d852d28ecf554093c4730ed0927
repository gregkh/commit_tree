PCI: dwc: Fix inverted condition of DMA mask setup warning

Commit 660c486590aa ("PCI: dwc: Set 32-bit DMA mask for MSI target address
allocation") added dma_mask_set() call to explicitly set 32-bit DMA mask
for MSI message mapping, but for now it throws a warning on ret == 0, while
dma_set_mask() returns 0 in case of success.

Fix this by inverting the condition.
