xen/events: Remove disfunct affinity spreading

This function can only ever work when the event channels:

  - are already established
  - interrupts assigned to them
  - the affinity has been set by user space already

because any newly set up event channel is forced to be bound to CPU0 and
the affinity mask of the interrupt is forced to contain cpumask_of(0).

As the CPU0 enforcement was in place _before_ this was implemented it's
entirely unclear how that can ever have worked at all.

Remove it as preparation for doing it proper.
