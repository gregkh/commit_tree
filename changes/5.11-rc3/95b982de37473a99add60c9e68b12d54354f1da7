btrfs: simplify return values in setup_nodes_for_search

The function is needlessly convoluted. Fix that by:

* removing redundant sret variable definition in both if arms

* replace the again/done labels with direct return statements, the
  function is short enough and doesn't do anything special upon exit

* remove BUG_ON on split_node returning a positive number - it can't
  happen as split_node returns either 0 or a negative error code.
