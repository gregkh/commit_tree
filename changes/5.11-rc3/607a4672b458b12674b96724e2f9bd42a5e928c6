firmware: arm_scmi: Add full list of sensor type enumeration

SCMI v2.0 provides a big list of sensor type enumeration from the
sensorUnits enumeration table of Distributed Management Task Force(DMTF)
specification number DSP 0248 (Platform Level Data Model for Platform
Monitoring and Control Specification). It is however not an exact
replica of the sensorUnits enumeration table.

Let us just update the table as per SCMI v2.0 specification.
