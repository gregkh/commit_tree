mfd: Intel Platform Monitoring Technology support

Intel Platform Monitoring Technology (PMT) is an architecture for
enumerating and accessing hardware monitoring facilities. PMT supports
multiple types of monitoring capabilities. This driver creates platform
devices for each type so that they may be managed by capability specific
drivers (to be introduced). Capabilities are discovered using PCIe DVSEC
ids. Support is included for the 3 current capability types, Telemetry,
Watcher, and Crashlog. The features are available on new Intel platforms
starting from Tiger Lake for which support is added. This patch adds
support for Tiger Lake (TGL), Alder Lake (ADL), and Out-of-Band Management
Services Module (OOBMSM).

Also add a quirk mechanism for several early hardware differences and bugs.
For Tiger Lake and Alder Lake, do not support Watcher and Crashlog
capabilities since they will not be compatible with future product. Also,
fix use a quirk to fix the discovery table offset.
