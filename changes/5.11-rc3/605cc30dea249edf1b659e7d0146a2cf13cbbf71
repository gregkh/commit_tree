zlib: move EXPORT_SYMBOL() and MODULE_LICENSE() out of dfltcc_syms.c

In commit 11fb479ff5d9 ("zlib: export S390 symbols for zlib modules"), I
added EXPORT_SYMBOL()s to dfltcc_inflate.c but then Mikhail said that
these should probably be in dfltcc_syms.c with the other
EXPORT_SYMBOL()s.

However, that is contrary to the current kernel style, which places
EXPORT_SYMBOL() immediately after the function that it applies to, so
move all EXPORT_SYMBOL()s to their respective function locations and
drop the dfltcc_syms.c file.  Also move MODULE_LICENSE() from the
deleted file to dfltcc.c.
