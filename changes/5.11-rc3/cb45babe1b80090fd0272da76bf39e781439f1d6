arm64/mm/hotplug: Register boot memory hot remove notifier earlier

This moves memory notifier registration earlier in the boot process from
device_initcall() to early_initcall() which will help in guarding against
potential early boot memory offline requests. Even though there should not
be any actual offlinig requests till memory block devices are initialized
with memory_dev_init() but then generic init sequence might just change in
future. Hence an early registration for the memory event notifier would be
helpful. While here, just skip the registration if CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE
is not enabled and also call out when memory notifier registration fails.
