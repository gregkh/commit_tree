userfaultfd: selftests: make __{s,u}64 format specifiers portable

On certain platforms (powerpcle is the one on which I ran into this),
"%Ld" and "%Lu" are unsuitable for printing __s64 and __u64, respectively,
resulting in build warnings.  Cast to {u,}int64_t, and use the PRI{d,u}64
macros defined in inttypes.h to print them.  This ought to be portable to
all platforms.

Splitting this off into a separate macro lets us remove some lines, and
get rid of some (I would argue) stylistically odd cases where we joined
printf() and exit() into a single statement with a ,.

Finally, this also fixes a "missing braces around initializer" warning
when we initialize prms in wp_range().
