drivers/misc/lkdtm: add new file in LKDTM to test fortified strscpy

This new test ensures that fortified strscpy has the same behavior than
vanilla strscpy (e.g.  returning -E2BIG when src content is truncated).
Finally, it generates a crash at runtime because there is a write overflow
in destination string.
