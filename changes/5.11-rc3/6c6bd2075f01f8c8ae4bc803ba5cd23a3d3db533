memory: tegra: Add and use devm_tegra_memory_controller_get()

Multiple Tegra drivers need to retrieve Memory Controller and there is
duplication of the retrieval code among the drivers.

Add new devm_tegra_memory_controller_get() helper to remove the code's
duplication and to fix put_device() which was missed in the duplicated
code. Make EMC drivers to use the new helper.
