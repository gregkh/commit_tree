ACPI: scan: Evaluate _DEP before adding the device

Evaluate _DEP before calling acpi_add_single_object() from
acpi_bus_check_add() and do that only for ACPI_BUS_TYPE_DEVICE
objects.

While at it, rename acpi_device_dep_initialize() to
acpi_scan_check_dep(), fix up a memory allocation statement in
that function, consistently treat memory allocation failures in
there as intermittent errors and make some related janitorial
changes in it.

This change will help to avoid calling acpi_add_single_object() if
there are unmet _DEP dependencies in the future, as that may cause
some control methods, potentially depending on the presence of
operation regions supplied by other devices, to be evaluated
prematurely.
