arm64: head: tidy up the Image header definition

Even though support for EFI boot remains entirely optional for arm64,
it is unlikely that we will ever be able to repurpose the image header
fields that the EFI loader relies on, i.e., the magic NOP at offset
0x0 and the PE header address at offset 0x3c.

So let's factor out the differences into a 'efi_signature_nop' macro and
a local symbol representing the PE header address, and move the
conditional definitions into efi-header.S, taking into account whether
CONFIG_EFI is enabled or not. While at it, switch to a signature NOP
that behaves more like a NOP, i.e., one that only clobbers the
flags.
