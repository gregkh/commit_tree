RDMA: Check flags during create_cq

Each driver should check that the CQ attrs is supported. Unfortuantely
when flags was added to the CQ attrs the drivers were not updated,
uverbs_ex_cmd_mask was used to block it. This was missed when create CQ
was converted to ioctl, so non-zero flags could have been passed into
drivers.

Check that flags is zero in all drivers that don't use it, remove
IB_USER_VERBS_EX_CMD_CREATE_CQ from uverbs_ex_cmd_mask.

Fixes: 41b2a71fc848 ("IB/uverbs: Move ioctl path of create_cq and destroy_cq to a new file")
