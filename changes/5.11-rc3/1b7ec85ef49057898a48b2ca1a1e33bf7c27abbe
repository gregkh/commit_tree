btrfs: pass root owner to read_tree_block

In order to properly set the lockdep class of a newly allocated block we
need to know the owner of the block.  For non-refcounted trees this is
straightforward, we always know in advance what tree we're reading from.
For refcounted trees we don't necessarily know, however all refcounted
trees share the same lockdep class name, tree-<level>.

Fix all the callers of read_tree_block() to pass in the root objectid
we're using.  In places like relocation and backref we could probably
unconditionally use 0, but just in case use the root when we have it,
otherwise use 0 in the cases we don't have the root as it's going to be
a refcounted tree anyway.

This is a preparation patch for further changes.
