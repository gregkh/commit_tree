sched/numa: Allow a floating imbalance between NUMA nodes

Currently, an imbalance is only allowed when a destination node
is almost completely idle. This solved one basic class of problems
and was the cautious approach.

This patch revisits the possibility that NUMA nodes can be imbalanced
until 25% of the CPUs are occupied. The reasoning behind 25% is somewhat
superficial -- it's half the cores when HT is enabled.  At higher
utilisations, balancing should continue as normal and keep things even
until scheduler domains are fully busy or over utilised.

Note that this is not expected to be a universal win. Any benchmark
that prefers spreading as wide as possible with limited communication
will favour the old behaviour as there is more memory bandwidth.
Workloads that communicate heavily in pairs such as netperf or tbench
benefit. For the tests I ran, the vast majority of workloads saw
a benefit so it seems to be a worthwhile trade-off.
