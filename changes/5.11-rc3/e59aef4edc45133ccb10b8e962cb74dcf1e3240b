remoteproc/mtk_scp: surround DT device IDs with CONFIG_OF

Now that this driver can be compiled with COMPILE_TEST, we have no
guarantee that CONFIG_OF will also be defined. When that happens, a
warning about mtk_scp_of_match being defined but unused will be reported
so make sure this variable is only defined if of_match_ptr() actually
uses it.
