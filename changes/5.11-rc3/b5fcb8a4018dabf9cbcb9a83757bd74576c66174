hwmon: pwm-fan: Refactor pwm_fan_probe

Use platform_irq_count to determine the number of fan tachometer inputs
configured in the device tree. At this stage we support either 0 or 1
inputs.

Once we have this information we only need to read the
pulses-per-revolution value if a fan tachometer is actually configured
via an IRQ value.

Also add a debug print of the IRQ number and the pulses-per-revolution
value to aid in investigating issues.
