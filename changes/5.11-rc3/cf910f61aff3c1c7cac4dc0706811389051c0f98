iommu/tegra-smmu: Unwrap tegra_smmu_group_get

The tegra_smmu_group_get was added to group devices in different
SWGROUPs and it'd return a NULL group pointer upon a mismatch at
tegra_smmu_find_group(), so for most of clients/devices, it very
likely would mismatch and need a fallback generic_device_group().

But now tegra_smmu_group_get handles devices in same SWGROUP too,
which means that it would allocate a group for every new SWGROUP
or would directly return an existing one upon matching a SWGROUP,
i.e. any device will go through this function.

So possibility of having a NULL group pointer in device_group()
is upon failure of either devm_kzalloc() or iommu_group_alloc().
In either case, calling generic_device_group() no longer makes a
sense. Especially for devm_kzalloc() failing case, it'd cause a
problem if it fails at devm_kzalloc() yet succeeds at a fallback
generic_device_group(), because it does not create a group->list
for other devices to match.

This patch simply unwraps the function to clean it up.
