KVM: arm64: Remove redundant hyp vectors entry

The hyp vectors entry corresponding to HYP_VECTOR_DIRECT (i.e. when
neither Spectre-v2 nor Spectre-v3a are present) is unused, as we can
simply dispatch straight to __kvm_hyp_vector in this case.

Remove the redundant vector, and massage the logic for resolving a slot
to a vectors entry.
