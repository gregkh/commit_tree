dmaengine: ti: k3-udma: Add support for BCDMA channel TPL handling

Unlike UDMAP the BCDMA defines the channel TPL levels per channel type.
In UDMAP the number of high and ultra-high channels applies to both tchan
and rchan.

BCDMA defines the TPL per channel types: bchan, tchan and rchan can have
different number of high and ultra-high channels.

In order to support BCDMA channel TPL we need to move the tpl information
as per channel type property for the DMAs.
