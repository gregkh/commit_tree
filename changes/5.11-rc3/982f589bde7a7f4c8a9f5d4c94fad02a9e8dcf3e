drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Update reply on aux failures

We should be setting the drm_dp_aux_msg::reply field if a NACK or a
SHORT reply happens. Update the error bit handling logic in
ti_sn_aux_transfer() to handle these cases and notify upper layers that
such errors have happened. This helps the retry logic understand that a
timeout has happened, or to shorten the read length if the panel isn't
able to handle the longest read possible.

Note: I don't have any hardware that exhibits these code paths so this
is written based on reading the datasheet for this bridge and inspecting
the code and how this is called.

Changes in v2:
 - Move WRITE_STATUS_UPDATE check from case to assignment

Changes in v2:
 - Handle WRITE_STATUS_UPDATE properly
