powerpc/pseries/hibernation: perform post-suspend fixups later

The pseries hibernate code calls post_mobility_fixup() which is sort
of a dumping ground of fixups that need to run after resuming from
suspend regardless of whether suspend was a hibernation or a
migration. Calling post_mobility_fixup() from
pseries_suspend_enable_irqs() runs this code early in resume with
devices suspended and only one CPU up, while the much more commonly
used migration case runs these fixups in a more typical process
context.

Call post_mobility_fixup() after the suspend core returns a success
status to the hibernate sysfs store method and remove
pseries_suspend_enable_irqs().
