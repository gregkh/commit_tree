ARM: dts: rainier: Add reserved memory for ramoops

Reserve a 1.5MiB region of memory to record kmsg dumps, console and
userspace message state into 16kiB ring-buffer slots. The sizing allows
for up to 16 dumps to be captured and read out.

Set max-reason to KMSG_DUMP_EMERG to capture bad-path reboots.
