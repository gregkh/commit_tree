net-tcp: Introduce tcp_recvmsg_locked().

Refactor tcp_recvmsg() by splitting it into locked and unlocked
portions. Callers already holding the socket lock and not using
ERRQUEUE/cmsg/busy polling can simply call tcp_recvmsg_locked().
This is in preparation for a short-circuit copy performed by
TCP receive zerocopy for small (< PAGE_SIZE, or otherwise requested
by the user) reads.
