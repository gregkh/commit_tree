libbpf: Add kernel module BTF support for CO-RE relocations

Teach libbpf to search for candidate types for CO-RE relocations across kernel
modules BTFs, in addition to vmlinux BTF. If at least one candidate type is
found in vmlinux BTF, kernel module BTFs are not iterated. If vmlinux BTF has
no matching candidates, then find all kernel module BTFs and search for all
matching candidates across all of them.

Kernel's support for module BTFs are inferred from the support for BTF name
pointer in BPF UAPI.
