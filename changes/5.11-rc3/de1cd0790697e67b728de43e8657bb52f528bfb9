powerpc/32s: Use SPRN_SPRG_SCRATCH2 in DSI prolog

Use SPRN_SPRG_SCRATCH2 as an alternative scratch register in
the early part of DSI prolog in order to avoid clobbering
SPRN_SPRG_SCRATCH0/1 used by other prologs.

The 603 doesn't like a jump from DataLoadTLBMiss to the 10 nops
that are now in the beginning of DSI exception as a result of
the feature section. To workaround this, add a jump as alternative.
It also avoids fetching 10 nops for nothing.
