scsi: lpfc: Enlarge max_sectors in scsi host templates

The driver supports arbitrarily large scatter-gather lists and the current
value for max_sectors is limiting.

Change max_sectors to the largest value.  This was actually done prior but
it only corrected one template and that template was later removed.

So change the remaining 2 templates. Other areas which hard-set the sectors
value should be inheriting what is in the template.
