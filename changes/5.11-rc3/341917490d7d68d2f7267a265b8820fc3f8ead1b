PCI: Decode PCIe 64 GT/s link speed

PCIe r6.0, sec 7.5.3.18, defines a new 64.0 GT/s bit in the Supported Link
Speeds Vector of Link Capabilities 2.

This patch does not affect the speed of the link, which should be
negotiated automatically by the hardware; it only adds decoding when
showing the speed to the user.

Decode this new speed.  Previously, reading the speed of a link operating
at this speed showed "Unknown speed" instead of "64.0 GT/s".
