ALSA: usb-audio: Improve some debug prints

There are a few rooms for improvements wrt the debug prints:
- The EP debug print is shown only at starting, not at stopping
- The EP debug print contains useless object addresses
- Some helpers show the urb and the EP object addresses, too

This patch addresses those shortcomings.
