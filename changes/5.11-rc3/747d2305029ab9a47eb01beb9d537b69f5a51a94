media: ccs: avoid printing an uninitialized variable

There is no intialization for the 'reg' variable, so printing
it produces undefined behavior as well as a compile-time warning:

drivers/media/i2c/ccs/ccs-core.c:314:49: error: variable 'reg' is uninitialized when used here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
                        "0x%8.8x %s pixels: %d %s (pixelcode %u)\n", reg,

Remove the variable and stop printing it.
