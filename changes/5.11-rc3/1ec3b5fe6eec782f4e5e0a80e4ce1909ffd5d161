mm/zswap: move to use crypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration

Right now, all new ZIP drivers are adapted to crypto_acomp APIs rather
than legacy crypto_comp APIs.  Tradiontal ZIP drivers like lz4,lzo etc
have been also wrapped into acomp via scomp backend.  But zswap.c is still
using the old APIs.  That means zswap won't be able to work on any new ZIP
drivers in kernel.

This patch moves to use cryto_acomp APIs to fix the disconnected bridge
between new ZIP drivers and zswap.  It is probably the first real user to
use acomp but perhaps not a good example to demonstrate how multiple acomp
requests can be executed in parallel in one acomp instance.  frontswap is
doing page load and store page by page synchronously.  swap_writepage()
depends on the completion of frontswap_store() to decide if it should call
__swap_writepage() to swap to disk.

However this patch creates multiple acomp instances, so multiple threads
running on multiple different cpus can actually do (de)compression
parallelly, leveraging the power of multiple ZIP hardware queues.  This is
also consistent with frontswap's page management model.

The old zswap code uses atomic context and avoids the race conditions
while shared resources like zswap_dstmem are accessed.  Here since acomp
can sleep, per-cpu mutex is used to replace preemption-disable.

While it is possible to make mm/page_io.c and mm/frontswap.c support async
(de)compression in some way, the entire design requires careful thinking
and performance evaluation.  For the first step, the base with fixed
connection between ZIP drivers and zswap should be built.
