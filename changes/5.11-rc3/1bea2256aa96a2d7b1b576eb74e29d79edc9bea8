ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add quirk for ARCHOS Cesium 140

Tha ARCHOS Cesium 140 tablet has problem with the jack-sensing,
thus the heaset functions are not working.

Add quirk for this model to select the correct input map, jack-detect
options and channel map to enable jack sensing and headset microphone.
This device uses IN1 for its internal MIC and JD2 for jack-detect.
