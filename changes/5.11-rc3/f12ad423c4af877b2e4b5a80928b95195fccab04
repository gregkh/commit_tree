tick: Remove pointless cpu valid check in hotplug code

tick_handover_do_timer() which is invoked when a CPU is unplugged has a
check for cpumask_first(cpu_online_mask) when it tries to hand over the
tick update duty.

Checking the result of cpumask_first() there is pointless because if the
online mask is empty at this point, then this would be the last CPU in the
system going offline, which is impossible. There is always at least one CPU
remaining. If online mask would be really empty then the timer duty would
be the least of the resulting problems.

Remove the well meant check simply because it is pointless and confusing.
