btrfs: replace fs_info and private_data with inode in btrfs_wq_submit_bio

All callers of btrfs_wq_submit_bio() pass struct inode as @private_data,
so there is no need for it to be (void *), replace it with "struct inode
*inode".

While we can extract fs_info from struct inode, also remove the @fs_info
parameter.

Since we're here, also replace all the (void *private_data) into (struct
inode *inode).
