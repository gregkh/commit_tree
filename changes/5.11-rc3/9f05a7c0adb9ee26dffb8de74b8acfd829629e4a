drm/i915: Add bigjoiner aware plane clipping checks

We need to look at hw.fb for the framebuffer, and add the translation
for the slave_plane_state. With these changes we set the correct
rectangle on the bigjoiner slave, and don't set incorrect
src/dst/visibility on the slave plane.

v2:
* Manual rebase (Manasi)

v3:
* hw.rotation instead of uapi.rotation (Ville)
