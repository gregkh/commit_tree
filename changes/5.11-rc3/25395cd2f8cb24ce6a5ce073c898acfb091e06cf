powerpc: Make NUMA depend on SMP

Our Kconfig allows NUMA to be enabled without SMP, but none of
our defconfigs use that combination. This means it can easily be
broken inadvertently by code changes, which has happened recently.

Although it's theoretically possible to have a machine with a single
CPU and multiple memory nodes, I can't think of any real systems where
that's the case. Even so if such a system exists, it can just run an
SMP kernel anyway.

So to avoid the need to add extra #ifdefs and/or build breaks, make
NUMA depend on SMP.
