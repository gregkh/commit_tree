crypto: caam: Replace in_irq() usage.

The driver uses in_irq() + in_serving_softirq() magic to decide if NAPI
scheduling is required or packet processing.

The usage of in_*() in drivers is phased out and Linus clearly requested
that code which changes behaviour depending on context should either be
separated or the context be conveyed in an argument passed by the caller,
which usually knows the context.

Use the `sched_napi' argument passed by the callback. It is set true if
called from the interrupt handler and NAPI should be scheduled.
