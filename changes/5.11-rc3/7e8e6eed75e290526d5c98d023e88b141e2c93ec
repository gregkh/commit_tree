KVM: SVM: Move asid to vcpu_svm

KVM does not have separate ASIDs for L1 and L2; either the nested
hypervisor and nested guests share a single ASID, or on older processor
the ASID is used only to implement TLB flushing.

Either way, ASIDs are handled at the VM level.  In preparation
for having different VMCBs passed to VMLOAD/VMRUN/VMSAVE for L1 and
L2, store the current ASID to struct vcpu_svm and only move it to
the VMCB in svm_vcpu_run.  This way, TLB flushes can be applied
no matter which VMCB will be active during the next svm_vcpu_run.
