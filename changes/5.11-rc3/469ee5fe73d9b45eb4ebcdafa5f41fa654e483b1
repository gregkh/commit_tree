net: dsa: tag_dsa: Unify regular and ethertype DSA taggers

Ethertype DSA encodes exactly the same information in the DSA tag as
the non-ethertype variety. So refactor out the common parts and reuse
them for both protocols.

This is ensures tag parsing and generation is always consistent across
all mv88e6xxx chips.

While we are at it, explicitly deal with all possible CPU codes on
receive, making sure to set offload_fwd_mark as appropriate.
