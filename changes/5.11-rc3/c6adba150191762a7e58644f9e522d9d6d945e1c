scsi: lpfc: Rework remote port lock handling

Currently the discovery layers within the driver use the SCSI midlayer
host_lock to access node-specific structures. This can contend with the I/O
path and is too coarse of a lock.

Rework the driver so that it uses a lock specific to the remote port node
structure when accessing the structure contents. A few of the changes
brought out spots were some slightly reorganized routines worked better.
