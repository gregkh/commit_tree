epoll: simplify and optimize busy loop logic

ep_events_available() is called multiple times around the busy loop logic,
even though the logic is generally not used.  ep_reset_busy_poll_napi_id()
is similarly always called, even when busy loop is not used.

Eliminate ep_reset_busy_poll_napi_id() and inline it inside
ep_busy_loop().  Make ep_busy_loop() return whether there are any events
available after the busy loop.  This will eliminate unnecessary loads and
branches, and simplifies the loop.
