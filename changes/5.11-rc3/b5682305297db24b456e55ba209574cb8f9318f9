ALSA: hda: intel-dsp-config: add helper for ACPI DSP driver selection

Mirror capabilities provided for PCI devices, so that distributions
can select which ACPI driver is loaded at run-time with kernel
parameters and DMI tables instead of forcing a build-time selection.

The "legacy" option supported for HDaudio has no meaning here and will
be ignored.

The 'SST' driver based on closed-source firmware has the priority to
avoid any impact on users, and the choice to use SOF is strictly
opt-in. This may change at some point when the 'SST' driver is
deprecated on Baytrail/Cherrytrail.
