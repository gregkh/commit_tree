bnxt_en: Restructure bnxt_flash_package_from_fw_obj() to execute in a loop.

On NICs with a smaller NVRAM, FW installation may fail after multiple
updates due to fragmentation.  The driver can retry when FW returns
a special error code.  To faciliate the retry, we restructure the
logic that performs the flashing in a loop.  The actual retry logic
will be added in the next patch.
