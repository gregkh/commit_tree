drm/savage/savage_bci: Remove set but never used 'aper_rsrc' and 'fb_rsrc'

The comment about them (also removed) says:

 /* fb_rsrc and aper_rsrc aren't really used currently, but still exist
  * in case we decide we need information on the BAR for BSD in the
  * future.
  */

Well that was written 12 years ago in 2008.  We are now in the future
and they are still superfluous.  We can always add them again at a
later date if they are ever required.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/gpu/drm/savage/savage_bci.c: In function ‘savage_driver_firstopen’:
 drivers/gpu/drm/savage/savage_bci.c:580:24: warning: variable ‘aper_rsrc’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 drivers/gpu/drm/savage/savage_bci.c:580:15: warning: variable ‘fb_rsrc’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
