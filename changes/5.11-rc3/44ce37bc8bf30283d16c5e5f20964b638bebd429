RDMA: Move more uverbs_cmd_mask settings to the core

These functions all depend on the driver providing a specific op:

- REREG_MR is rereg_user_mr(). bnxt_re set this without providing the op
- ATTACH/DEATCH_MCAST is attach_mcast()/detach_mcast(). usnic set this
  without providing the op
- OPEN_QP doesn't involve the driver but requires a XRCD. qedr provides
  xrcd but forgot to set it, usnic doesn't provide XRCD but set it anyhow.
- OPEN/CLOSE_XRCD are the ops alloc_xrcd()/dealloc_xrcd()
- CREATE_SRQ/DESTROY_SRQ are the ops create_srq()/destroy_srq()
- QUERY/MODIFY_SRQ is op query_srq()/modify_srq(). hns sets this but
  sometimes supplies a NULL op.
- RESIZE_CQ is op resize_cq(). bnxt_re sets this boes doesn't supply an op
- ALLOC/DEALLOC_MW is alloc_mw()/dealloc_mw(). cxgb4 provided an
  (now deleted) implementation but no userspace

All drivers were checked that no drivers provide the op without also
setting uverbs_cmd_mask so this should have no functional change.
