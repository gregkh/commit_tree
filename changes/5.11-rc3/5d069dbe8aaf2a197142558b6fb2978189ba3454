fuse: fix bad inode

Jan Kara's analysis of the syzbot report (edited):

  The reproducer opens a directory on FUSE filesystem, it then attaches
  dnotify mark to the open directory.  After that a fuse_do_getattr() call
  finds that attributes returned by the server are inconsistent, and calls
  make_bad_inode() which, among other things does:

          inode->i_mode = S_IFREG;

  This then confuses dnotify which doesn't tear down its structures
  properly and eventually crashes.

Avoid calling make_bad_inode() on a live inode: switch to a private flag on
the fuse inode.  Also add the test to ops which the bad_inode_ops would
have caught.

This bug goes back to the initial merge of fuse in 2.6.14...
