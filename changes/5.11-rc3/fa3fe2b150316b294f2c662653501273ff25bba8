mptcp: track window announced to peer

OoO handling attempts to detect when packet is out-of-window by testing
current ack sequence and remaining space vs. sequence number.

This doesn't work reliably. Store the highest allowed sequence number
that we've announced and use it to detect oow packets.

Do this when mptcp options get written to the packet (wire format).
For this to work we need to move the write_options call until after
stack selected a new tcp window.
