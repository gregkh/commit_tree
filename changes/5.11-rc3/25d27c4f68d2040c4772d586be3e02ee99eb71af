ASoC: pcm512x: Add support for more data formats

Currently, pcm512x driver supports only I2S data format.
This commit adds RJ, LJ, DSP_A and DSP_B as well.

I don't expect regression WRT existing sound cards, because:

* default value in corresponding register of pcm512x codec is 0 ==  I2S
* existing in-tree sound cards with pcm512x codec are configured for I2S
* i don't see how existing off-tree sound cards with pcm512x codec could be
  configured differently - it would not work
* tested explicitly, that there is no regression with Raspberry Pi +
  sound card `sound/soc/bcm/hifiberry_dacplus.c`
