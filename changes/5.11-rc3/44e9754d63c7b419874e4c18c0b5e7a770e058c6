powerpc/32s: Make support for 603 and 604+ selectable

book3s/32 has two main families:
- CPU with 603 cores that don't have HASH PTE table and
perform SW TLB loading.
- Other CPUs based on 604+ cores that have HASH PTE table.

This leads to some complex logic and additionnal code to
support both. This makes sense for distribution kernels
that aim at running on any CPU, but when you are fine
tuning a kernel for an embedded 603 based board you
don't need all the HASH logic.

Allow selection of support for each family, in order to opt
out unneeded parts of code. At least one must be selected.

Note that some of the CPU supporting HASH also support SW TLB
loading, however it is not supported by Linux kernel at the
time being, because they do not have alternate registers in
the TLB miss exception handlers.
