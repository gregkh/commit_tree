kasan, mm: allow cache merging with no metadata

The reason cache merging is disabled with KASAN is because KASAN puts its
metadata right after the allocated object. When the merged caches have
slightly different sizes, the metadata ends up in different places, which
KASAN doesn't support.

It might be possible to adjust the metadata allocation algorithm and make
it friendly to the cache merging code. Instead this change takes a simpler
approach and allows merging caches when no metadata is present. Which is
the case for hardware tag-based KASAN with kasan.mode=prod.
