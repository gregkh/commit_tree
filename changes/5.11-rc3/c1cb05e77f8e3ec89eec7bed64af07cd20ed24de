kcov: don't instrument with UBSAN

Both KCOV and UBSAN use compiler instrumentation.  If UBSAN detects a bug
in KCOV, it may cause infinite recursion via printk and other common
functions.  We already don't instrument KCOV with KASAN/KCSAN for this
reason, don't instrument it with UBSAN as well.

As a side effect this also resolves the following gcc warning:

conflicting types for built-in function '__sanitizer_cov_trace_switch';
expected 'void(long unsigned int, void *)'
[-Wbuiltin-declaration-mismatch]

It's only reported when kcov.c is compiled with any of the sanitizers
enabled.  Size of the arguments is correct, it's just that gcc uses 'long'
on 64-bit arches and 'long long' on 32-bit arches, while kernel type is
always 'long long'.
