KVM: arm64: Fix hyp_cpu_pm_{init,exit} __init annotation

The __init annotations on hyp_cpu_pm_{init,exit} are obviously incorrect,
and the build system shouts at you if you enable DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH.

Nothing really bad happens as we never execute that code outside of the
init context, but we can't label the callers as __int either, as kvm_init
isn't __init itself. Oh well.
