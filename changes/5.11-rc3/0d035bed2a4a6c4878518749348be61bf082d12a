net: sfp: VSOL V2801F / CarlitoxxPro CPGOS03-0490 v2.0 workaround

Add a workaround for the detection of VSOL V2801F / CarlitoxxPro
CPGOS03-0490 v2.0 GPON module which CarlitoxxPro states needs single
byte I2C reads to the EEPROM.

Pali Rohár reports that he also has a CarlitoxxPro-based V2801F module,
which reports a manufacturer of "OEM". This manufacturer can't be
matched as it appears in many different modules, so also match the part
number too.
