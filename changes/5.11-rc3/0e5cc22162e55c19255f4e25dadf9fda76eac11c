ALSA: hda: intel-dsp-config: ignore dsp_driver parameter for PCI legacy devices

On Haswell/Broadwell/Baytrail/Braswell, the DSP is not used for the
HDMI/DP interface, and setting the dsp_driver parameter to a value > 1
has the side effect of preventing the HDaudio legacy driver from
probing.

The DSP driver selection should really only handle cases where a DSP
is actually used. This patch traps all known PCI devices and makes
sure the HDaudio driver can always be probed.
