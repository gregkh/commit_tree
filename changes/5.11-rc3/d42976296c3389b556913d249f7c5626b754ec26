USB: serial: cp210x: clean up line-control handling

Update the line-control settings in one request unconditionally instead
of setting the word-length, parity and stop-bit settings separately.

This avoids multiple requests when several settings are changed even if
this scheme could potentially also be used to detect unsupported device
settings. Since all device types but CP2101 appears to support all
settings, let's handle that one specifically and also report back the
unsupported settings properly through termios by clearing the
corresponding bits.

Also drop the related unnecessary debug printks.
