net: hns3: add support for extended promiscuous command

For DEVICE_VERSION_V2, the hardware supports enable tx and rx
promiscuous separately. But tx or rx promiscuous is active for
unicast, multicast and broadcast promiscuous simultaneously.
To support traffics between functions belong to the same port,
we always enable tx promiscuous for broadcast promiscuous, so
tx promiscuous for unicast and multicast promiscuous is also
enabled.

For DEVICE_VERSION_V3, the hardware decouples the above
relationship. Tx unicast promiscuous, rx unicast promiscuous,
tx multicast promiscuous, rx multicast promiscuous, tx broadcast
promiscuous and rx broadcast promiscuous can be enabled separately.

So add support for the new promiscuous command.
