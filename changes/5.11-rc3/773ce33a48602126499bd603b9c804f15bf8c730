mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Create common functions for VLAN-aware bridge

The code in mlxsw_sp_bridge_8021q_port_{join, leave}() can be used also
for 802.1ad bridge.

Move the code to functions called
mlxsw_sp_bridge_vlan_aware_port_{join, leave}() and call them from
mlxsw_sp_bridge_8021q_port_{join, leave}() respectively to enable code
reuse.
