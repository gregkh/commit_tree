media: v4l2-fwnode: Say it's fine to use v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_parse

Earlier it was expected that there would be more variable size endpoint
properties and that most if not all drivers would need them. For that
reason it was expected also that v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_parse would no
longer be needed.

What actually happened that not all drivers require "link-frequencies",
the only variable size media endpoint property without a small upper
limit. Therefore drivers that do not need that information are fine using
v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_parse. So don't tell drivers to use
v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_alloc_parse in all cases.
