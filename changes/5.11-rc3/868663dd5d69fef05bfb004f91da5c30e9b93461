coresight: tmc-etf: Fix NULL ptr dereference in tmc_enable_etf_sink_perf()

There was a report of NULL pointer dereference in ETF enable
path for perf CS mode with PID monitoring. It is almost 100%
reproducible when the process to monitor is something very
active such as chrome and with ETF as the sink and not ETR.
Currently in a bid to find the pid, the owner is dereferenced
via task_pid_nr() call in tmc_enable_etf_sink_perf() and with
owner being NULL, we get a NULL pointer dereference.

Looking at the ETR and other places in the kernel, ETF and the
ETB are the only places trying to dereference the task(owner)
in tmc_enable_etf_sink_perf() which is also called from the
sched_in path as in the call trace. Owner(task) is NULL even
in the case of ETR in tmc_enable_etr_sink_perf(), but since we
cache the PID in alloc_buffer() callback and it is done as part
of etm_setup_aux() when allocating buffer for ETR sink, we never
dereference this NULL pointer and we are safe. So lets do the
same thing with ETF and cache the PID to which the cs_buffer
belongs in tmc_alloc_etf_buffer() as done for ETR. This will
also remove the unnecessary function calls(task_pid_nr()) since
we are caching the PID.

Easily reproducible running below:

 perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etf0/ -N -p <pid>
