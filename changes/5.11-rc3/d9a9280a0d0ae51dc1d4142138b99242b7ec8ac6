seq_buf: Avoid type mismatch for seq_buf_init

Building with W=2 prints a number of warnings for one function that
has a pointer type mismatch:

linux/seq_buf.h: In function 'seq_buf_init':
linux/seq_buf.h:35:12: warning: pointer targets in assignment from 'unsigned char *' to 'char *' differ in signedness [-Wpointer-sign]

Change the type in the function prototype according to the type in
the structure.
