drm/amd/pm: correct table_clk_vlt memory size due to replacing one-element array with flexible-array in struct phm_clock_voltage_dependency_table

Add 1 to the size passed to kzalloc after replacing one-element array.

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code according to the use of a flexible-array member in
struct phm_ppt_v1_mm_clock_voltage_dependency_table, instead of a
one-element array, and use the struct_size() helper to calculate the
size for the allocation.
