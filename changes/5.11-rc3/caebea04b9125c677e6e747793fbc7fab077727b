ASoC: SOF: Intel: add hw specific PCM constraints

Part of PCM constraints are set based on DSP topology, but rest
should be set based on hardware capabilities. Add PCM constraints
for Intel platforms:

- Add constraint for the period count to be integer. This avoids
  wrap-arounds of the DMA circular buffer in middle of a period.

- Align period size to dword/32bit as per HDA spec.

Both constraints are aligned with current implementation in snd-hda-intel
driver.
