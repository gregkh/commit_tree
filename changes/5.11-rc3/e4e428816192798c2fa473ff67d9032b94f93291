btrfs: remove redundant time check in transaction kthread loop

The value obtained from ktime_get_seconds() is guaranteed to be
monotonically increasing since it's taken from CLOCK_MONOTONIC. As
transaction_kthread obtains a reference to the currently running
transaction under holding btrfs_fs_info::trans_lock it's guaranteed to:

a) see an initialized 'cur', whose start_time is guaranteed to be smaller
   than 'now'

or

b) not obtain a 'cur' and simply go to sleep.

Given this remove the unnecessary check, if it sees
now < cur->start_time this would imply there are far greater problems on
the machine.
