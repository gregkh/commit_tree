media: ccs: Fix obtaining bus information from firmware

Let v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_alloc_parse to figure out the type of the data
bus. As the old bindings did not require the "bus-type" property, we need
to rely on guessing between CSI-2 D-PHY and CCP2. Setting the type to
CSI-2 D-PHY will parse just that and succeed even if no data-lanes are
set.

Also add a comment on the matter to the driver to avoid breaking this in
the future.
