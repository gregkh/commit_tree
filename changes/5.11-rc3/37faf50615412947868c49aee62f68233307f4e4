USB: serial: keyspan_pda: fix write-wakeup use-after-free

The driver's deferred write wakeup was never flushed on disconnect,
something which could lead to the driver port data being freed while the
wakeup work is still scheduled.

Fix this by using the usb-serial write wakeup which gets cancelled
properly on disconnect.
