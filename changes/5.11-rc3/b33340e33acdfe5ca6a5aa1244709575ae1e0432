drm/meson: dw-hdmi: Ensure that clocks are enabled before touching the TOP registers

Removing the meson-dw-hdmi module and re-inserting it results in a hang
as the driver writes to HDMITX_TOP_SW_RESET. Similar effects can be seen
when booting with mainline u-boot and using the u-boot provided DT (which
is highly desirable).

The reason for the hang seem to be that the clocks are not always
enabled by the time we enter meson_dw_hdmi_init(). Moving this call
*after* dw_hdmi_probe() ensures that the clocks are enabled.
