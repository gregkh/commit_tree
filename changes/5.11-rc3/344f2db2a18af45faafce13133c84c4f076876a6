arm64: vmlinux.lds.S: Drop redundant *.init.rodata.*

We currently try to emit *.init.rodata.* twice, once in INIT_DATA, and once
in the line immediately following it. As the two section definitions are
identical, the latter is redundant and can be dropped.

This patch drops the redundant *.init.rodata.* section definition.
