ubifs: Limit dumping length by size of memory which is allocated for the node

To prevent memory out-of-bounds accessing in ubifs_dump_node(), actual
dumping length should be restricted by another condition(size of memory
which is allocated for the node).

This patch handles following situations (These situations may be caused
by bit flipping due to hardware error, writing bypass ubifs, unknown
bugs in ubifs, etc.):
1. bad node_len: Dumping data according to 'ch->len' which may exceed
   the size of memory allocated for node.
2. bad node content: Some kinds of node can record additional data, eg.
   index node and orphan node, make sure the size of additional data
   not beyond the node length.
3. node_type changes: Read data according to type A, but expected type
   B, before that, node is allocated according to type B's size. Length
   of type A node is greater than type B node.
