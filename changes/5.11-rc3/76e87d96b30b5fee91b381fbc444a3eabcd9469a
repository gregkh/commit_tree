ntp: Consolidate the RTC update implementation

The code for the legacy RTC and the RTC class based update are pretty much
the same. Consolidate the common parts into one function and just invoke
the actual setter functions.

For RTC class based devices the update code checks whether the offset is
valid for the device, which is usually not the case for the first
invocation. If it's not the same it stores the correct offset and lets the
caller try again. That's not much different from the previous approach
where the first invocation had a pretty low probability to actually hit the
allowed window.
