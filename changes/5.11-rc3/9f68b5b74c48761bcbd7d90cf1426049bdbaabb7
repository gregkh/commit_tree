sched: Detect call to schedule from critical entry code

Detect calls to schedule() between user_enter() and user_exit(). Those
are symptoms of early entry code that either forgot to protect a call
to schedule() inside exception_enter()/exception_exit() or, in the case
of HAVE_CONTEXT_TRACKING_OFFSTACK, enabled interrupts or preemption in
a wrong spot.
