clk: vc5: Use "idt,voltage-microvolt" instead of "idt,voltage-microvolts"

Commit 45c940184b501fc6 ("dt-bindings: clk: versaclock5: convert to
yaml") accidentally changed "idt,voltage-microvolts" to
"idt,voltage-microvolt" in the DT bindings, while the driver still used
the former.

Update the driver to match the bindings, as
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/property-units.txt actually recommends
using "microvolt".
