rwsem: Implement down_read_interruptible

In preparation for converting exec_update_mutex to a rwsem so that
multiple readers can execute in parallel and not deadlock, add
down_read_interruptible.  This is needed for perf_event_open to be
converted (with no semantic changes) from working on a mutex to
wroking on a rwsem.
