samples: bpf: Remove bpf_load loader completely

Numerous refactoring that rewrites BPF programs written with bpf_load
to use the libbpf loader was finally completed, resulting in BPF
programs using bpf_load within the kernel being completely no longer
present.

This commit removes bpf_load, an outdated bpf loader that is difficult
to keep up with the latest kernel BPF and causes confusion.

Also, this commit removes the unused trace_helper and bpf_load from
samples/bpf target objects from Makefile.
