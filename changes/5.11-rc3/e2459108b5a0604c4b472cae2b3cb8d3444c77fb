usb: gadget: enable super speed plus

Enable Super speed plus in configfs to support USB3.1 Gen2.
This ensures that when a USB gadget is plugged in, it is
enumerated as Gen 2 and connected at 10 Gbps if the host and
cable are capable of it.

Many in-tree gadget functions (fs, midi, acm, ncm, mass_storage,
etc.) already have SuperSpeed Plus support.

Tested: plugged gadget into Linux host and saw:
