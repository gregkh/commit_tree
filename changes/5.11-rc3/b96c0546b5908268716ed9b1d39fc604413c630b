soc: bcm: brcmstb: pm: pm-arm: Provide prototype for brcmstb_pm_s3_finish()

brcmstb_pm_s3_finish() cannot be made static because it is referenced
from brcmstb_pm_s3(), so let's provide a prototype for it instead.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/soc/bcm/brcmstb/pm/pm-arm.c:395:14: warning: no previous prototype for ‘brcmstb_pm_s3_finish’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
