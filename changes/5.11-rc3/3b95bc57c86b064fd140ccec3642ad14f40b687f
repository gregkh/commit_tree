Input: adp5589-keys - remove setup/teardown hooks for gpios

This is currently just dead code. It's from around a time when
platform-data was used, and a board could hook it's own special callback
for setup/teardown, and a private object (via 'context').

This change removes it, as there are no more users in mainline for this.
