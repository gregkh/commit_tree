usb: typec: tcpci: Add support to report vSafe0V

This change adds vbus_vsafe0v which when set, makes TCPM
query for VSAFE0V by assigning the tcpc.is_vbus_vsafe0v callback.
Also enables ALERT.ExtendedStatus which is triggered when
status of EXTENDED_STATUS.vSafe0V changes.
EXTENDED_STATUS.vSafe0V is set when vbus is at vSafe0V and
cleared otherwise.
