ath10k: add option for chip-id based BDF selection

In some devices difference in chip-id should be enough to pick
the right BDF. Add another support for chip-id based BDF selection.
With this new option, ath10k supports 2 fallback options.

The board name with chip-id as option looks as follows
board name 'bus=snoc,qmi-board-id=ff,qmi-chip-id=320'
