drm/msm/dp: Handle aux timeouts, nacks, defers

Let's look at the irq status bits after a transfer and see if we got a
nack or a defer or a timeout, instead of telling drm layers that
everything was fine, while still printing an error message. I wasn't
sure about NACK+DEFER so I lumped all those various errors along with a
nack so that the drm core can figure out that things are just not going
well. The important thing is that we're now returning -ETIMEDOUT when
the message times out and nacks for bad addresses.
