drm/i915/dmc: Let's abstract the dmc path.

Although this abstraction removes the convenience of grepping
for the file name, it:
- makes addition easier.
- makes it easier to tweak global path when experiments are needed.
- get in sync with guc/huc, without getting overly abstracted.
- allows future junction with CSR_VERSION for simplicity.
- Enforces dmc file will never change this standard.

v2: define DMC_PATH inside .c (Lucas)
