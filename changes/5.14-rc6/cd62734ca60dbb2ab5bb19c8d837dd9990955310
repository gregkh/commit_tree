mm/rmap: split try_to_munlock from try_to_unmap

The behaviour of try_to_unmap_one() is difficult to follow because it
performs different operations based on a fairly large set of flags used in
different combinations.

TTU_MUNLOCK is one such flag.  However it is exclusively used by
try_to_munlock() which specifies no other flags.  Therefore rather than
overload try_to_unmap_one() with unrelated behaviour split this out into
it's own function and remove the flag.
