net: qualcomm: rmnet: return earlier for bad checksum

In rmnet_map_ipv4_dl_csum_trailer(), if the sum of the trailer
checksum and the pseudo checksum is non-zero, checksum validation
has failed.  We can return an error as soon as we know that.

We can do the same thing in rmnet_map_ipv6_dl_csum_trailer().

Add some comments that explain where we're headed.
