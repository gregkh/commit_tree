KVM: nVMX: Introduce 'EVMPTR_MAP_PENDING' post-migration state

Unlike regular set_current_vmptr(), nested_vmx_handle_enlightened_vmptrld()
can not be called directly from vmx_set_nested_state() as KVM may not have
all the information yet (e.g. HV_X64_MSR_VP_ASSIST_PAGE MSR may not be
restored yet). Enlightened VMCS is mapped later while getting nested state
pages. In the meantime, vmx->nested.hv_evmcs_vmptr remains 'EVMPTR_INVALID'
and it's indistinguishable from 'evmcs is not in use' case. This leads to
certain issues, in particular, if KVM_GET_NESTED_STATE is called right
after KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE, KVM_STATE_NESTED_EVMCS flag in the resulting
state will be unset (and such state will later fail to load).

Introduce 'EVMPTR_MAP_PENDING' state to detect not-yet-mapped eVMCS after
restore. With this, the 'is_guest_mode(vcpu)' hack in vmx_has_valid_vmcs12()
is no longer needed.
