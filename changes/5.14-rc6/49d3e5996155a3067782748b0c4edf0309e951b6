scsi: fc: FDMI enhancement

Added RHBA and RPA attributes type and length.

As per FC_GC_7 document section "Table 400 â€“ Attribute Entry Types and
associated Values" ASCII type attributes length can be vary from "4 to 256
byte".  If we keep all RHBA ASCII attributes length 256 then total length
is going upto 2750, which is far more than 2048 (max frame size).

In libfc we do have logic to split FCP commands but not for CT commands.
Practically all version/names get covered with in 64 bytes except OS name,
for that we need 128 bytes.  Hence length of all RBHA ASCII attributes
is reduced to 64 bytes and 128 bytes in case of OS name.

RPA attributes total length is within frame size.
