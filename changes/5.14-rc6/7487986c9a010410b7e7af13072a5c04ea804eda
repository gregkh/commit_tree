clk: imx: scu: Only save DC SS clock using non-cached clock rate

Display sub-system has special clock settings in SCFW, the
bypassed clock is used instead of PLL in Linux kernel clock
tree, so when saving clock rate, need to save non-cached clock
rate for Display sub-system's bypass clocks, and other clocks
still use the cached clock rate which is with runtime PM ON.
