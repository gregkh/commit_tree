btrfs: simplify eb checksum verification in btrfs_validate_metadata_buffer

The verification copies the calculated checksum bytes to a temporary
buffer but this is not necessary. We can map the eb header on the first
page and use the checksum bytes directly.

This saves at least one function call and boundary checks so it could
lead to a minor performance improvement.
