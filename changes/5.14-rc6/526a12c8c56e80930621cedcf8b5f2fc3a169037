RDMA/cm: Use an attribute_group on the ib_port_attribute intead of kobj's

This code is trying to attach a list of counters grouped into 4 groups to
the ib_port sysfs. Instead of creating a bunch of kobjects simply express
everything naturally as an ib_port_attribute and add a single
attribute_groups list.

Remove all the naked kobject manipulations.
