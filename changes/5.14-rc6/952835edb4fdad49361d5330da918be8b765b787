s390/dasd: fix use after free in dasd path handling

When new configuration data is obtained after a path event it is stored
in the per path array. The old data needs to be freed.
The first valid configuration data is also referenced in the device
private structure to identify the device.
When the old per path configuration data was freed the device still
pointed to the already freed data leading to a use after free.

Fix by replacing also the device configuration data with the newly
obtained one before the old data gets freed.
