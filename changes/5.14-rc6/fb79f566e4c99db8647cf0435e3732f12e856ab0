KVM: nSVM: Check that VM_HSAVE_PA MSR was set before VMRUN

APM states that "The address written to the VM_HSAVE_PA MSR, which holds
the address of the page used to save the host state on a VMRUN, must point
to a hypervisor-owned page. If this check fails, the WRMSR will fail with
a #GP(0) exception. Note that a value of 0 is not considered valid for the
VM_HSAVE_PA MSR and a VMRUN that is attempted while the HSAVE_PA is 0 will
fail with a #GP(0) exception."

svm_set_msr() already checks that the supplied address is valid, so only
check for '0' is missing. Add it to nested_svm_vmrun().
