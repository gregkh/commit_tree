x86/pkeys: Revert a5eff7259790 ("x86/pkeys: Add PKRU value to init_fpstate")

This cannot work and it's unclear how that ever made a difference.

init_fpstate.xsave.header.xfeatures is always 0 so get_xsave_addr() will
always return a NULL pointer, which will prevent storing the default PKRU
value in init_fpstate.
