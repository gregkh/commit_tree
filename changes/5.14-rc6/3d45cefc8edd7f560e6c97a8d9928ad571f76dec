scsi: core: Drop obsolete Linux-specific SCSI status codes

Originally the SCSI subsystem has been using 'special' SCSI status codes,
which were the SAM-specified ones but shifted by 1.  As most drivers have
now been modified to use the SAM-specified ones, having two nearly
identical sets of definitions only causes confusion.

The Linux-specifed SCSI status codes have been marked obsolete for several
years so drop them and use the SAM-specified status codes throughout.
