net: dsa: microchip: ksz8795: Fix VLAN untagged flag change on deletion

When a VLAN is deleted from a port, the flags in struct
switchdev_obj_port_vlan are always 0.  ksz8_port_vlan_del() copies the
BRIDGE_VLAN_INFO_UNTAGGED flag to the port's Tag Removal flag, and
therefore always clears it.

In case there are multiple VLANs configured as untagged on this port -
which seems useless, but is allowed - deleting one of them changes the
remaining VLANs to be tagged.

It's only ever necessary to change this flag when a VLAN is added to
the port, so leave it unchanged in ksz8_port_vlan_del().
