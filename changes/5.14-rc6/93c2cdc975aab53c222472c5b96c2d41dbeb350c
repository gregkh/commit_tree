x86/fpu/xstate: Clear xstate header in copy_xstate_to_uabi_buf() again

The change which made copy_xstate_to_uabi_buf() usable for
[x]fpregs_get() removed the zeroing of the header which means the
header, which is copied to user space later, contains except for the
xfeatures member, random stack content.

Add the memset() back to zero it before usage.
