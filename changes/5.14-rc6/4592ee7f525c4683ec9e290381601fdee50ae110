netfilter: conntrack: remove offload_pickup sysctl again

These two sysctls were added because the hardcoded defaults (2 minutes,
tcp, 30 seconds, udp) turned out to be too low for some setups.

They appeared in 5.14-rc1 so it should be fine to remove it again.

Marcelo convinced me that there should be no difference between a flow
that was offloaded vs. a flow that was not wrt. timeout handling.
Thus the default is changed to those for TCP established and UDP stream,
5 days and 120 seconds, respectively.

Marcelo also suggested to account for the timeout value used for the
offloading, this avoids increase beyond the value in the conntrack-sysctl
and will also instantly expire the conntrack entry with altered sysctls.

Example:
   nf_conntrack_udp_timeout_stream=60
   nf_flowtable_udp_timeout=60

This will remove offloaded udp flows after one minute, rather than two.

An earlier version of this patch also cleared the ASSURED bit to
allow nf_conntrack to evict the entry via early_drop (i.e., table full).
However, it looks like we can safely assume that connection timed out
via HW is still in established state, so this isn't needed.

Quoting Oz:
 [..] the hardware sends all packets with a set FIN flags to sw.
 [..] Connections that are aged in hardware are expected to be in the
 established state.

In case it turns out that back-to-sw-path transition can occur for
'dodgy' connections too (e.g., one side disappeared while software-path
would have been in RETRANS timeout), we can adjust this later.
