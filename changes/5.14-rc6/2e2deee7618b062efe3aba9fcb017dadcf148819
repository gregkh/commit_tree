net: hns3: add the RAS compatibility adaptation solution

To adapt to hardware modification and ensure that the driver is
compatible with the original error handling content, we need to add the
RAS compatibility adaptation solution.

Add a processing branch to the driver during error handling. In the new
processing branch, NIC fault information is integrated by the IMP. An
interaction command is added between the driver and IMP to query
and clear the fault source and interrupt source. The IMP integrates
error information and reports the highest reset level to the driver.
