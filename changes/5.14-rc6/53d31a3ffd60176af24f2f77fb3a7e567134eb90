SMB3.1.1: Add support for negotiating signing algorithm

Support for faster packet signing (using GMAC instead of CMAC) can
now be negotiated to some newer servers, including Windows.
See MS-SMB2 section 2.2.3.17.

This patch adds support for sending the new negotiate context
with the first of three supported signing algorithms (AES-CMAC)
and decoding the response.  A followon patch will add support
for sending the other two (including AES-GMAC, which is fastest)
and changing the signing algorithm used based on what was
negotiated.

To allow the client to request GMAC signing set module parameter
"enable_negotiate_signing" to 1.
