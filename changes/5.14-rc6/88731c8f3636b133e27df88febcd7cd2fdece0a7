s390/boot: fix zstd build for -march=z900

zstd decompression uses __builtin_clz() which fails back to __clzdi2()
when the kernel is built for older hardware like z900. This leads to
build failures like the following:
s390x-11.1.0-ld: /devel/src/kernel/arch/s390/boot/compressed/../../../../lib/zstd/bitstream.h:148: undefined reference to `__clzdi2'

Fix that by optionally including lib/clz_ctz.c into the decompressor.
