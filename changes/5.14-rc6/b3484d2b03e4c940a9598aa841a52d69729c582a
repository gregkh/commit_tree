drm/fb-helper: improve DRM fbdev emulation device names

Framebuffer devices that are registered by DRM drivers for fbdev emulation
have a "drmfb" suffix in their name. But makes them to be quite confusing
for drivers that already have "drm" in their name:

$ cat /proc/fb
0 rockchipdrmdrmfb

$ cat /proc/fb
0 simpledrmdrmfb

Also, there isn't a lot of value in adding these "drmfb" suffices to their
names, since users shouldn't really care if the FB devices were registered
by a real fbdev driver or a DRM driver using the fbdev emulation.

What programs should be interested about is if there's a DRM device, and
there are better ways to query that info than reading this procfs entry.

So let's just remove the suffix, which leads to much better device names:

$ cat /proc/fb
0 rockchipdrm

$ cat /proc/fb
0 simpledrm
