HID: asus: Remove check for same LED brightness on set

Remove the early return on LED brightness set so that any controller
application, daemon, or desktop may set the same brightness at any stage.

This is required because many ASUS ROG keyboards will default to max
brightness on laptop resume if the LEDs were set to off before sleep.
