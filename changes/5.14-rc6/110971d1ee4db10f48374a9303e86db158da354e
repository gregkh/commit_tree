net: ipa: FLAVOR_0 register doesn't exist until IPA v3.5

The FLAVOR_0 version first appears in IPA v3.5, so avoid attempting
to read it for versions prior to that.

This register contains a concise definition of the number and
direction of endpoints supported by the hardware, and without it
we can't verify endpoint configuration in ipa_endpoint_config().
In this case, just indicate that any endpoint number is available
for use.
