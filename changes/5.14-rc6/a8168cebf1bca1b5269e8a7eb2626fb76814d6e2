arm64: dts: mt8183: Add node for the Mali GPU

Add a basic GPU node for mt8183, as well as OPP table.

Note that with the current panfrost driver, devfreq is not
actually functional, as the we do not have platform-specific
support for >1 supplies. Also, we are missing code to handle
frequency change, as the GPU frequency needs to be switched
away to a stable 26Mhz clock during the transition.
