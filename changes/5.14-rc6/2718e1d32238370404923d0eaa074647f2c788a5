habanalabs/gaudi: print last QM PQEs on error

In case QMAN has an error and stop_on_err is true, print specific
information of the "offending" command buffer batch.

If the error occurred on one of the higher CPs, the CQ pointer and size
will be printed along with (up to) last 8 PQEs of the stream.

If the error occurred in the lower CP, the CQ pointer and size will be
printed along with (up to) last 8 PQEs of ALL upper CPs as we have no
way to know which upper CP sent the job there.

This is done so higher SW levels will be able to debug their CS by
extracting the raw data of the offending command buffer batch and
examine those offline to detect the issue.
