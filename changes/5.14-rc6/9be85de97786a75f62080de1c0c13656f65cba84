locking/atomic: make ARCH_ATOMIC a Kconfig symbol

Subsequent patches will move architectures over to the ARCH_ATOMIC API,
after preparing the asm-generic atomic implementations to function with
or without ARCH_ATOMIC.

As some architectures use the asm-generic implementations exclusively
(and don't have a local atomic.h), and to avoid the risk that
ARCH_ATOMIC isn't defined in some cases we expect, let's make the
ARCH_ATOMIC macro a Kconfig symbol instead, so that we can guarantee it
is consistently available where needed.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
