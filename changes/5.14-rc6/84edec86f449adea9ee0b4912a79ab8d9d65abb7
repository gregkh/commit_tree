iio: humidity: hdc100x: Add margin to the conversion time

The datasheets have the following note for the conversion time
specification: "This parameter is specified by design and/or
characterization and it is not tested in production."

Parts have been seen that require more time to do 14-bit conversions for
the relative humidity channel.  The result is ENXIO due to the address
phase of a transfer not getting an ACK.

Delay an additional 1 ms per conversion to allow for additional margin.
