soundwire/ASoC: add leading zeroes in peripheral device name

We recently added leading zeroes in dev_dbg() messages but forgot to
do the same for the peripheral device name. Adding leading zeroes
makes it easier to read manufacturer ID and part ID, e.g.:

sdw:0:025d:0700:00
sdw:0:025d:0711:00
sdw:1:025d:0700:00
sdw:1:025d:1308:00
sdw:2:025d:0700:00
sdw:2:025d:0701:00
sdw:3:025d:0700:00
sdw:3:025d:0715:00

The use of '01x' for link_id and unique_id is intentional to show the
value range in the code, it's understood it does not actually change
the format.

To avoid problems with git bisect, the same change needs to be applied
to the Intel SoundWire machine driver, otherwise the components can't
be found and the card registration fails.
