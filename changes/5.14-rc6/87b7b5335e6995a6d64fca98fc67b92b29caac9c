bpf: Add missing bpf_read_[un]lock_trace() for syscall program

Commit 79a7f8bdb159d ("bpf: Introduce bpf_sys_bpf() helper and program type.")
added support for syscall program, which is a sleepable program.

But the program run missed bpf_read_lock_trace()/bpf_read_unlock_trace(),
which is needed to ensure proper rcu callback invocations. This patch adds
bpf_read_[un]lock_trace() properly.

Fixes: 79a7f8bdb159d ("bpf: Introduce bpf_sys_bpf() helper and program type.")
