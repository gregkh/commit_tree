can: usb_8dev: fix memory leak

In usb_8dev_start() MAX_RX_URBS coherent buffers are allocated and
there is nothing, that frees them:

1) In callback function the urb is resubmitted and that's all
2) In disconnect function urbs are simply killed, but URB_FREE_BUFFER
   is not set (see usb_8dev_start) and this flag cannot be used with
   coherent buffers.

So, all allocated buffers should be freed with usb_free_coherent()
explicitly.

Side note: This code looks like a copy-paste of other can drivers. The
same patch was applied to mcba_usb driver and it works nice with real
hardware. There is no change in functionality, only clean-up code for
coherent buffers.
