mm: slub: fix slub_debug disabling for list of slabs

Vijayanand Jitta reports:

  Consider the scenario where CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON is set and we would
  want to disable slub_debug for few slabs. Using boot parameter with
  slub_debug=-,slab_name syntax doesn't work as expected i.e; only
  disabling debugging for the specified list of slabs. Instead it
  disables debugging for all slabs, which is wrong.

This patch fixes it by delaying the moment when the global slub_debug
flags variable is updated.  In case a "slub_debug=-,slab_name" has been
passed, the global flags remain as initialized (depending on
CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON enabled or disabled) and are not simply reset to 0.
