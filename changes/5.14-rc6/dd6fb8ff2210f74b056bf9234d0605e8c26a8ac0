ASoC: wm_adsp: Correct wm_coeff_tlv_get handling

When wm_coeff_tlv_get was updated it was accidentally switch to the _raw
version of the helper causing it to ignore the current DSP state it
should be checking. Switch the code back to the correct helper so that
users can't read the controls when they arn't available.
