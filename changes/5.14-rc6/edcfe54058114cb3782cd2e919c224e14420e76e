KVM: X86: Move write_l1_tsc_offset() logic to common code and rename it

The write_l1_tsc_offset() callback has a misleading name. It does not
set L1's TSC offset, it rather updates the current TSC offset which
might be different if a nested guest is executing. Additionally, both
the vmx and svm implementations use the same logic for calculating the
current TSC before writing it to hardware.

Rename the function and move the common logic to the caller. The vmx/svm
specific code now merely sets the given offset to the corresponding
hardware structure.
