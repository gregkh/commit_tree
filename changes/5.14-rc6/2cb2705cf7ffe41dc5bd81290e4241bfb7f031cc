media: ipu3-cio2: Fix reference counting when looping over ACPI devices

When we continue, due to device is disabled, loop we have to drop
reference count. When we have an array full of devices we have to also
drop the reference count. Note, in this case the
cio2_bridge_unregister_sensors() is called by the caller.
