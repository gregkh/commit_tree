powerpc: Define empty_zero_page[] in C

At the time being, empty_zero_page[] is defined in each
platform head.S.

Define it in mm/mem.c instead, and put it in BSS section instead
of the DATA section. Commit 5227cfa71f9e ("arm64: mm: place
empty_zero_page in bss") explains why it is interesting to have
it in BSS.
