cpufreq: Make cpufreq_online() call driver->offline() on errors

In the CPU removal path the ->offline() callback provided by the
driver is always invoked before ->exit(), but in the cpufreq_online()
error path it is not, so ->exit() is expected to somehow know the
context in which it has been called and act accordingly.

That is less than straightforward, so make cpufreq_online() invoke
the driver's ->offline() callback, if present, on errors before
->exit() too.

This only potentially affects intel_pstate.
