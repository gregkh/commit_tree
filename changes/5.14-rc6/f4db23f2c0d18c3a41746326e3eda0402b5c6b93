drm/i915/ttm: Embed a ttm buffer object in the i915 gem object

Embed a struct ttm_buffer_object into the i915 gem object, making sure
we alias the gem object part. It's a bit unfortunate that the
struct ttm_buffer_ojbect embeds a gem object since we otherwise could
make the TTM part private to the TTM backend, and use the usual
i915 gem object for the other backends.
To make this a bit more storage efficient for the other backends,
we'd have to use a pointer for the gem object which would require
a lot of changes in the driver. We postpone that for later.
