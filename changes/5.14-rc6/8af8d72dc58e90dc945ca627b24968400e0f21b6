powerpc/32s: Speed up likely path of kuap_update_sr()

In most cases, kuap_update_sr() will update a single segment
register.

We know that first update will always be done, if there is no
segment register to update at all, kuap_update_sr() is not
called.

Avoid recurring calculations and tests in that case.
