vhost-scsi: remove extra flushes

The vhost work flush function was flushing the entire work queue, so
there is no need for the double vhost_work_dev_flush calls in
vhost_scsi_flush.

And we do not need to call vhost_poll_flush for each poller because
that call also ends up flushing the same work queue thread the
vhost_work_dev_flush call flushed.
