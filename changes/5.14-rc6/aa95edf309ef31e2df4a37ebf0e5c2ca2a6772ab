NFSv4/pnfs: Fix the layout barrier update

If we have multiple outstanding layoutget requests, the current code to
update the layout barrier assumes that the outstanding layout stateids
are updated in order. That's not necessarily the case.

Instead of using the value of lo->plh_outstanding as a guesstimate for
the window of values we need to accept, just wait to update the window
until we're processing the last one. The intention here is just to
ensure that we don't process 2^31 seqid updates without also updating
the barrier.
