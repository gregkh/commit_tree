alpha: Send stop IPI to send to online CPUs

This issue was noticed while debugging a shutdown issue where some
secondary CPUs are not being shutdown correctly.  A fix for that [1] requires
that secondary cpus be offlined using the cpu_online_mask so that the
stop operation is a no-op if CPU HOTPLUG is disabled.  I, like the author in
[1] looked at the architectures and found that alpha is one of two
architectures that executes smp_send_stop() on all possible CPUs.

On alpha, smp_send_stop() sends an IPI to all possible CPUs but only needs
to send them to online CPUs.

Send the stop IPI to only the online CPUs.
