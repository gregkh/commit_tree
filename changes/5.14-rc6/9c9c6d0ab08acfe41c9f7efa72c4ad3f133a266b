drm/i915: Correct SFC_DONE register offset

The register offset for SFC_DONE was missing a '0' at the end, causing
us to read from a non-existent register address.  We only use this
register in error state dumps so the mistake hasn't caused any real
problems, but fixing it will hopefully make the error state dumps a bit
more useful for debugging.
