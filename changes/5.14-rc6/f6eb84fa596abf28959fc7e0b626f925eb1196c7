ASoC: tegra: Set driver_name=tegra for all machine drivers

The driver_name="tegra" is now required by the newer ALSA UCMs, otherwise
Tegra UCMs don't match by the path/name.

All Tegra machine drivers are specifying the card's name, but it has no
effect if model name is specified in the device-tree since it overrides
the card's name. We need to set the driver_name to "tegra" in order to
get a usable lookup path for the updated ALSA UCMs. The new UCM lookup
path has a form of driver_name/card_name.

The old lookup paths that are based on driver module name continue to
work as before. Note that UCM matching never worked for Tegra ASoC drivers
if they were compiled as built-in, this is fixed by supporting the new
naming scheme.
