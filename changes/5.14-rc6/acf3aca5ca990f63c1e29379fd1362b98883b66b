drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Simplify refclk handling

The clock framework makes it simple to deal with an optional clock.
You can call clk_get_optional() and if the clock isn't specified it'll
just return NULL without complaint. It's valid to pass NULL to
enable/disable/prepare/unprepare. Let's make use of this to simplify
things a tiny bit.
