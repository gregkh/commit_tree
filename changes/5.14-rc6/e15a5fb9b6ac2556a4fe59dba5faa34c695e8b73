drm/amdgpu: introduce a stolen reserved buffer to protect specific buffer region (v2)

Some ASICs such as Yellow Carp needs to reserve a region of video memory
to avoid access from driver. So this patch is to introduce a stolen
reserved buffer to protect specific buffer region.

v2: free this buffer in amdgpu_ttm_fini.
