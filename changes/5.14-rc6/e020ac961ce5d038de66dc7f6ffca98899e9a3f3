drm/msm/dpu: Fix error return code in dpu_mdss_init()

The error code returned by platform_get_irq() is stored in 'irq', it's
forgotten to be copied to 'ret' before being returned. As a result, the
value 0 of 'ret' is returned incorrectly.

After the above fix is completed, initializing the local variable 'ret'
to 0 is no longer needed, remove it.

In addition, when dpu_mdss_init() is successfully returned, the value of
'ret' is always 0. Therefore, replace "return ret" with "return 0" to make
the code clearer.
