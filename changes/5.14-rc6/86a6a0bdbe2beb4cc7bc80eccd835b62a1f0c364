scsi: arcmsr: Avoid over-read of sense buffer

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally reading across neighboring array fields.

pcmd->sense_buffer is 96 bytes, and was being manually zero-filled.
However, struct SENSE_DATA is 18 bytes, with ccb->arcmsr_cdb.SenseData only
being 15 bytes, resulting in a 3 byte over-read.

Copy only the contents of ccb->arcmsr_cdb.SenseData and zero fill the
remainder, avoiding potential over-reads.
