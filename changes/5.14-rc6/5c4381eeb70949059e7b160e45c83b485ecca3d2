drm/panel: panel-simple: Get rid of hacky HPD chicken-and-egg code

When I added support for the hpd-gpio to simple-panel in commit
48834e6084f1 ("drm/panel-simple: Support hpd-gpios for delaying
prepare()"), I added a special case to handle a circular dependency I
was running into on the ti-sn65dsi86 bridge chip. On my board the
hpd-gpio is actually provided by the bridge chip. That was causing
some circular dependency problems that I had to work around by getting
the hpd-gpio late.

I've now reorganized the ti-sn65dsi86 bridge chip driver to be a
collection of sub-drivers. Now the GPIO part can probe separately and
that breaks the chain. Let's get rid of the old code to clean things
up.
