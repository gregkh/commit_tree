btrfs: zoned: bail out if we can't read a reliable write pointer

If we can't read a reliable write pointer from a sequential zone fail
creating the block group with an I/O error.

Also if the read write pointer is beyond the end of the respective zone,
fail the creation of the block group on this zone with an I/O error.

While this could also happen in real world scenarios with misbehaving
drives, this issue addresses a problem uncovered by fstests' test case
generic/475.
