Reimplement RLIMIT_MEMLOCK on top of ucounts

The rlimit counter is tied to uid in the user_namespace. This allows
rlimit values to be specified in userns even if they are already
globally exceeded by the user. However, the value of the previous
user_namespaces cannot be exceeded.

Changelog

v11:
* Fix issue found by lkp robot.

v8:
* Fix issues found by lkp-tests project.

v7:
* Keep only ucounts for RLIMIT_MEMLOCK checks instead of struct cred.

v6:
* Fix bug in hugetlb_file_setup() detected by trinity.
