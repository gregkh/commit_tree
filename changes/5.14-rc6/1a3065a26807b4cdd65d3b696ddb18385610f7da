net: bridge: mcast: prepare is-router function for mcast router split

In preparation for the upcoming split of multicast router state into
their IPv4 and IPv6 variants make br_multicast_is_router() protocol
family aware.

Note that for now br_ip6_multicast_is_router() uses the currently still
common ip4_mc_router_timer for now. It will be renamed to
ip6_mc_router_timer later when the split is performed.

While at it also renames the "1" and "2" constants in
br_multicast_is_router() to the MDB_RTR_TYPE_TEMP_QUERY and
MDB_RTR_TYPE_PERM enums.
