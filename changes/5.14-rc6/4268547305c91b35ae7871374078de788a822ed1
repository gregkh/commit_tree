xfs: simplify xfs_dialloc_select_ag() return values

The only caller of xfs_dialloc_select_ag() will always return
-ENOSPC to it's caller if the agbp returned from
xfs_dialloc_select_ag() is NULL. IOWs, failure to find a candidate
AGI we can allocate inodes from is always an ENOSPC condition, so
move this logic up into xfs_dialloc_select_ag() so we can simplify
the return logic in this function.

xfs_dialloc_select_ag() now only ever returns 0 with a locked
agbp, or an error with no agbp.
