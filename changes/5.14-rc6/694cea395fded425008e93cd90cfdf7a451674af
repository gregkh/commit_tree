bpf: Allow RCU-protected lookups to happen from bh context

XDP programs are called from a NAPI poll context, which means the RCU
reference liveness is ensured by local_bh_disable(). Add
rcu_read_lock_bh_held() as a condition to the RCU checks for map lookups so
lockdep understands that the dereferences are safe from inside *either* an
rcu_read_lock() section *or* a local_bh_disable() section. While both
bh_disabled and rcu_read_lock() provide RCU protection, they are
semantically distinct, so we need both conditions to prevent lockdep
complaints.

This change is done in preparation for removing the redundant
rcu_read_lock()s from drivers.
