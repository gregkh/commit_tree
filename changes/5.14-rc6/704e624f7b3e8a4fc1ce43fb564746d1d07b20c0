net: mvvp2: fix short frame size on s390

On s390, the following build warning occurs:

drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvpp2/mvpp2.h:844:2: warning: overflow in
conversion from 'long unsigned int' to 'int' changes value from
'18446744073709551584' to '-32' [-Woverflow]
844 |  ((total_size) - MVPP2_SKB_HEADROOM - MVPP2_SKB_SHINFO_SIZE)

This happens because MVPP2_SKB_SHINFO_SIZE, which is 320 bytes (which is
already 64-byte aligned) on some architectures, actually gets ALIGN'd up
to 512 bytes in the s390 case.

So then, when this is invoked:

    MVPP2_RX_MAX_PKT_SIZE(MVPP2_BM_SHORT_FRAME_SIZE)

...that turns into:

     704 - 224 - 512 == -32

...which is not a good frame size to end up with! The warning above is a
bit lucky: it notices a signed/unsigned bad behavior here, which leads
to the real problem of a frame that is too short for its contents.

Increase MVPP2_BM_SHORT_FRAME_SIZE by 32 (from 704 to 736), which is
just exactly big enough. (The other values can't readily be changed
without causing a lot of other problems.)
