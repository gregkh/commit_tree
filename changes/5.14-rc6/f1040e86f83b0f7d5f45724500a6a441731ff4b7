ASoC: cs42l42: PLL must be running when changing MCLK_SRC_SEL

Both SCLK and PLL clocks must be running to drive the glitch-free mux
behind MCLK_SRC_SEL and complete the switchover.

This patch moves the writing of MCLK_SRC_SEL to when the PLL is started
and stopped, so that it only transitions while the PLL is running.
The unconditional write MCLK_SRC_SEL=0 in cs42l42_mute_stream() is safe
because if the PLL is not running MCLK_SRC_SEL is already 0.
