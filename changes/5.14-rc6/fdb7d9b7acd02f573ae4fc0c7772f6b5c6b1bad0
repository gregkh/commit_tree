alpha: remove DISCONTIGMEM and NUMA

Patch series "Remove DISCONTIGMEM memory model", v3.

SPARSEMEM memory model was supposed to entirely replace DISCONTIGMEM a
(long) while ago.  The last architectures that used DISCONTIGMEM were
updated to use other memory models in v5.11 and it is about the time to
entirely remove DISCONTIGMEM from the kernel.

This set removes DISCONTIGMEM from alpha, arc and m68k, simplifies memory
model selection in mm/Kconfig and replaces usage of redundant
CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES and CONFIG_FLAT_NODE_MEM_MAP with CONFIG_NUMA
and CONFIG_FLATMEM respectively.

I've also removed NUMA support on alpha that was BROKEN for more than 15
years.

There were also minor updates all over arch/ to remove mentions of
DISCONTIGMEM in comments and #ifdefs.

This patch (of 9):

NUMA is marked broken on alpha for more than 15 years and DISCONTIGMEM was
replaced with SPARSEMEM in v5.11.

Remove both NUMA and DISCONTIGMEM support from alpha.
