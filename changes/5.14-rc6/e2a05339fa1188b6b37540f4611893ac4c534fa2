RDMA/rxe: Use the correct size of wqe when processing SRQ

The memcpy() that copies a WQE from a SRQ the QP uses an incorrect size.
The size should have been the size of the rxe_send_wqe struct not the size
of a pointer to it. The result is that IO operations using a SRQ on the
responder side will fail.
