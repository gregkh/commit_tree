perf stat: Add Topdown metrics L2 events as default events

The Topdown Microarchitecture Analysis (TMA) Method is a structured
analysis methodology to identify critical performance bottlenecks in
out-of-order processors.

The Topdown metrics L1 event was added as default in 42641d6f4d15e6db
("perf stat: Add Topdown metrics events as default events")

From the Sapphire Rapids server and later platforms, the same dedicated
"metrics" register is extended to support both L1 and L2 events.

Add both L1 and L2 Topdown metrics events as default to enrich the
default measuring information if the new measurement register is
available.

On legacy systems there is no change to avoid extra multiplexing.

The topdown_level indicates the max metrics level for the top-down
statistics. Set it to 2 to display all L1 and L2 Topdown metrics events.

With the patch:

  $ perf stat sleep 1
