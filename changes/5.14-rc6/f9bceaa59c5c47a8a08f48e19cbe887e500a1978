libbpf: Skip bpf_object__probe_loading for light skeleton

I'm getting the following error when running 'gen skeleton -L' as
regular user:

libbpf: Error in bpf_object__probe_loading():Operation not permitted(1).
Couldn't load trivial BPF program. Make sure your kernel supports BPF
(CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y) and/or that RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is set to big enough
value.
