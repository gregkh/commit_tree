hwmon: (ntc_thermistor) Drop unused headers.

The IIO usage in this driver is purely consumer so it should only
be including linux/iio/consumer.h  Whilst here drop pm_runtime.h
as there is no runtime power management in the driver.

Found using include-what-you-use and manual inspection of the
suggestions.
