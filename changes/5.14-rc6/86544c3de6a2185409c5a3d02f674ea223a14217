net: mdio: provide shim implementation of devm_of_mdiobus_register

Similar to the way in which of_mdiobus_register() has a fallback to the
non-DT based mdiobus_register() when CONFIG_OF is not set, we can create
a shim for the device-managed devm_of_mdiobus_register() which calls
devm_mdiobus_register() and discards the struct device_node *.

In particular, this solves a build issue with the qca8k DSA driver which
uses devm_of_mdiobus_register and can be compiled without CONFIG_OF.
