ALSA: pcm: Fix mmap breakage without explicit buffer setup

The recent fix c4824ae7db41 ("ALSA: pcm: Fix mmap capability check")
restricts the mmap capability only to the drivers that properly set up
the buffers, but it caused a regression for a few drivers that manage
the buffer on its own way.

For those with UNKNOWN buffer type (i.e. the uninitialized / unused
substream->dma_buffer), just assume that the driver handles the mmap
properly and blindly trust the hardware info bit.
