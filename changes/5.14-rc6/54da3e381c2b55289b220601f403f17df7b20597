serial: 8250_aspeed_vuart: use UPF_IOREMAP to set up register mapping

Previously this driver's use of devm_ioremap_resource() led to
duplicated calls to __release_region() when unbinding it (one from
serial8250_release_std_resource() and one from devres_release_all()),
the second of which resulted in a warning message:

  # echo 1e787000.serial > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/aspeed-vuart/unbind
  [33091.774200] Trying to free nonexistent resource <000000001e787000-000000001e78703f>

With this change the driver uses the generic serial8250 code's
UPF_IOREMAP to take care of the register mapping automatically instead
of doing its own devm_ioremap_resource(), thus avoiding the duplicate
__release_region() on unbind.

In doing this we eliminate vuart->regs, since it merely duplicates
vuart->port->port.membase, which we now use for our I/O accesses.
