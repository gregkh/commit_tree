powerpc/32s: Refactor update of user segment registers

KUEP implements the update of user segment registers.

Move it into mmu-hash.h in order to use it from other places.

And inline kuep_lock() and kuep_unlock(). Inlining kuep_lock() is
important for system_call_exception(), otherwise system_call_exception()
has to save into stack the system call parameters that are used just
after, and doing that takes more instructions than kuep_lock() itself.
