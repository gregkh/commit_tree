crypto: ecdh - extend 'cra_driver_name' with curve name

Currently, 'cra_driver_name' cannot be used to specify ecdh algorithm
with a special curve, so extending it with curve name.

Although using 'cra_name' can also specify a special curve, but ecdh
generic driver cannot be specified when vendor hardware accelerator
has registered.
