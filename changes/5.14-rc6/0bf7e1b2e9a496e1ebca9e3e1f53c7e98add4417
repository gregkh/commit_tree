KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: implement hash host / hash guest support

Implement support for hash guests under hash host. This has to save and
restore the host SLB, and ensure that the MMU is off while switching
into the guest SLB.

POWER9 and later CPUs now always go via the P9 path. The "fast" guest
mode is now renamed to the P9 mode, which is consistent with its
functionality and the rest of the naming.
