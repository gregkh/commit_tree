Revert "ALSA: bebob/oxfw: fix Kconfig entry for Mackie d.2 Pro"

This reverts commit 0edabdfe89581669609eaac5f6a8d0ae6fe95e7f.

I've explained that optional FireWire card for d.2 is also built-in to
d.2 Pro, however it's wrong. The optional card uses DM1000 ASIC and has
'Mackie DJ Mixer' in its model name of configuration ROM. On the other
hand, built-in FireWire card for d.2 Pro and d.4 Pro uses OXFW971 ASIC
and has 'd.Pro' in its model name according to manuals and user
experiences. The former card is not the card for d.2 Pro. They are similar
in appearance but different internally.
