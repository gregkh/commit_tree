virtio/vsock: enable SEQPACKET for transport

To make transport work with SOCK_SEQPACKET add two things:
1) SOCK_SEQPACKET ops for virtio transport and 'seqpacket_allow()'
   callback.
2) Handling of SEQPACKET bit: guest tries to negotiate it with vhost,
   so feature will be enabled only if bit is negotiated with device.
