docs: printk-formats: update size-casting examples

Since commit 72deb455b5ec ("block: remove CONFIG_LBDAF") sector_t and
blkcnt_t types are no longer variable in size, making them unsuitable
examples for casting to the largest possible type. This patch replaces
such examples with cycles_t and blk_status_t types, whose sizes depend
on architecture and config options respectively.
