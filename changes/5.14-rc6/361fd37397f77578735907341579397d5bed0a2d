PCI/MSI: Do not set invalid bits in MSI mask

msi_mask_irq() takes a mask and a flags argument. The mask argument is used
to mask out bits from the cached mask and the flags argument to set bits.

Some places invoke it with a flags argument which sets bits which are not
used by the device, i.e. when the device supports up to 8 vectors a full
unmask in some places sets the mask to 0xFFFFFF00. While devices probably
do not care, it's still bad practice.
