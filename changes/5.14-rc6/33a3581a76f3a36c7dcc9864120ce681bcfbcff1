arm64: entry: move arm64_preempt_schedule_irq to entry-common.c

Subsequent patches will pull more of the IRQ entry handling into C. To
keep this in one place, let's move arm64_preempt_schedule_irq() into
entry-common.c along with the other entry management functions.

We no longer need to include <linux/lockdep.h> in process.c, so the
include directive is removed.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
