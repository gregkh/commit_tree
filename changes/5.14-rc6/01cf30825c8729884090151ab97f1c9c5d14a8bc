cifs: make locking consistent around the server session status

There were three places where we were not taking the spinlock
around updates to server->tcpStatus when it was being modified.
To be consistent (also removes Coverity warning) and to remove
possibility of race best to lock all places where it is updated.
Two of the three were in initialization of the field and can't
race - but added lock around the other.
