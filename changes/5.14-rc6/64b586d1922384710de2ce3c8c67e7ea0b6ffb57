mm/rmap: fix comments left over from recent changes

Parallel developments in mm/rmap.c have left behind some out-of-date
comments: try_to_migrate_one() also accepts TTU_SYNC (already commented
in try_to_migrate() itself), and try_to_migrate() returns nothing at
all.

TTU_SPLIT_FREEZE has just been deleted, so reword the comment about it
in mm/huge_memory.c; and TTU_IGNORE_ACCESS was removed in 5.11, so
delete the "recently referenced" comment from try_to_unmap_one() (once
upon a time the comment was near the removed codeblock, but they drifted
apart).
