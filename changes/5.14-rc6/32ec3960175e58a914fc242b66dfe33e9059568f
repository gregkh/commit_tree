pinctrl: qcom: fix GPIOLIB dependencies

Enabling the PINCTRL_SM8350 symbol without GPIOLIB or SCM causes a build
failure:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for PINCTRL_MSM
  Depends on [m]: PINCTRL [=y] && (ARCH_QCOM [=y] || COMPILE_TEST [=y]) && GPIOLIB [=y] && (QCOM_SCM [=m] || !QCOM_SCM [=m])
  Selected by [y]:
  - PINCTRL_SM8350 [=y] && PINCTRL [=y] && (ARCH_QCOM [=y] || COMPILE_TEST [=y]) && GPIOLIB [=y] && OF [=y]
aarch64-linux-ld: drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-msm.o: in function `msm_gpio_irq_set_type':
pinctrl-msm.c:(.text.msm_gpio_irq_set_type+0x1c8): undefined reference to `qcom_scm_io_readl'

The main problem here is the 'select PINCTRL_MSM', which needs to be a
'depends on' as it is for all the other front-ends. As the GPIOLIB
dependency is now implied by that, symbol, remove the duplicate
dependencies in the process.

Fixes: d5d348a3271f ("pinctrl: qcom: Add SM8350 pinctrl driver")
Fixes: 376f9e34c10f ("drivers: pinctrl: qcom: fix Kconfig dependency on GPIOLIB")
