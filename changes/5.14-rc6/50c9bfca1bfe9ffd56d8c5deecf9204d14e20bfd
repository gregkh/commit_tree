arm64: dts: ti: k3-am642-main: fix ports mac properties

The current device tree CPSW3g node adds non-zero "mac-address" property to
the ports, which prevents random MAC address assignment to network devices
if bootloader failed to update DT. This may cause more then one host to
have the same MAC in the network.

 mac-address = [00 00 de ad be ef];
 mac-address = [00 01 de ad be ef];

In addition, there is one MAC address available in eFuse registers which
can be used for default port 1.

Hence, fix ports MAC properties by:
- resetting "mac-address" property to 0
- adding ti,syscon-efuse = <&main_conf 0x200> to Port 1
