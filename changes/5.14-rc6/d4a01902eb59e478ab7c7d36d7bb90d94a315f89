s390/dasd: use register pair instead of register asm

Using register asm statements has been proven to be very error prone,
especially when using code instrumentation where gcc may add function
calls, which clobbers register contents in an unexpected way.

Therefore get rid of register asm statement in dasd code, even though
there is currently nothing wrong with it. This way we know for sure
that the above mentioned bug class won't be introduced here.
