octeontx2-af: add support for custom KPU entries

Add ability to load a set of custom KPU entries. This
allows for flexible support for custom protocol parsing.

AF driver will attempt to load the profile and verify if it can fit
hardware capabilities. If not, it will revert to the built-in profile.

Next it will replace the first KPU_MAX_CST_LT (2) entries in each KPU
in default profile with entries read from the profile image.
The built-in profile should always contain KPU_MAX_CSR_LT first no-match
entries and AF driver will disable those in the KPU unless custom
profile is loaded.

Profile file contains also a list of default protocol overrides to
allow for custom protocols to be used there.
