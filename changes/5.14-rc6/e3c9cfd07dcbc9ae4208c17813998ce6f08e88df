perf test: Pass the verbose option to shell tests

Having a verbose option will allow shell tests to provide extra failure
details when the fail or skip.

Committer notes:

Keep the 'script' variable at PATH_MAX, as its just something we'll pass
to system(), not really a "path", so being arbitrary, reduce the patch
size by not adding the three extra bytes to the 'script' variable.
