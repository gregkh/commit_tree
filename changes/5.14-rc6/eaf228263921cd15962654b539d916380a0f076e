Revert "xfrm: policy: Read seqcount outside of rcu-read side in xfrm_policy_lookup_bytype"

This reverts commit d7b0408934c749f546b01f2b33d07421a49b6f3e.

This commit tried to fix a locking bug introduced by commit 77cc278f7b20
("xfrm: policy: Use sequence counters with associated lock"). As it
turned out, this patch did not really fix the bug. A proper fix
for this bug is applied on top of this revert.
