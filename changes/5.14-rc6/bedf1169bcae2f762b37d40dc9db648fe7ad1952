wcn36xx: Add GTK offload info to WoWLAN resume

Having enabled GTK rekey in suspend, we need to extract the replay counter
from the firmware on resume and perform a ieee80211_gtk_rekey_notify() so
that the STA remains verified from the perspective of the AP.

In order to enable the SMD command and response we need to pack the
existing command/response structures. Given these structures are currently
unused, there's no need to backport this as a fix.
