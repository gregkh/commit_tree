netfilter: nfnetlink_hook: use the sequence number of the request message

The sequence number allows to correlate the netlink reply message (as
part of the dump) with the original request message.

The cb->seq field is internally used to detect an interference (update)
of the hook list during the netlink dump, do not use it as sequence
number in the netlink dump header.
