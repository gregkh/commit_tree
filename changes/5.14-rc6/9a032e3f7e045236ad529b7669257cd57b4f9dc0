staging: greybus: audio: Fix sparse warning.

Sparse complains that:
   warning: restricted send_ctl_elem_iface_t degrades to integer.

I have looked at this code, and the code is fine as-is. Normally we
would frown on using the __force directive to silence Sparse warnings
but in this case it's fine. Case statements can't be made into __bitwise
types. We also can't change the type of "ctl->iface" either because that
is part of the user space API.

So just add a (__force int) to make the warning go away.
