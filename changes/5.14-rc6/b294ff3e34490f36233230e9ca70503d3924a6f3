scsi: ufs: core: Enable power management for wlun

During runtime-suspend of ufs host, the SCSI devices are already suspended
and so are the queues associated with them. However, the ufs host sends SSU
(START_STOP_UNIT) to the wlun during runtime-suspend.

During the process blk_queue_enter() checks if the queue is not in suspended
state. If so, it waits for the queue to resume, and never comes out of
it. Commit 52abca64fd94 ("scsi: block: Do not accept any requests while
suspended") adds the check to see if the queue is in suspended state in
blk_queue_enter().

Fix this by registering ufs device wlun as a SCSI driver and registering it
for block runtime-pm. Also make this a supplier for all other LUNs. This
way the wlun device suspends after all the consumers and resumes after HBA
resumes. This also registers a new SCSI driver for rpmb wlun. This new
driver is mostly used to clear rpmb uac.
