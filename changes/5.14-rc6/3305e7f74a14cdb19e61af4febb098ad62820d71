arm64: smp: remove stack from secondary_data

When we boot a secondary CPU, we pass it a task and a stack to use. As
the stack is always the task's stack, which can be derived from the
task, let's have the secondary CPU derive this itself and avoid passing
redundant information.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
