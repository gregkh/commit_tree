arm64: update string routine copyrights and URLs

To make future archaeology easier, let's have the string routine comment
blocks encode the specific upstream commit ID they were imported from.
These are the same commit IDs as listed in the commits importing the
code, expanded to 16 characters. Note that the routines have different
commit IDs, each reprsenting the latest upstream commit which changed
the particular routine.

At the same time, let's consistently include 2021 in the copyright
dates.
