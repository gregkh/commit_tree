perf inject: Add --vm-time-correlation option

Intel PT timestamps are affected by virtualization. Add a new option
that will allow the Intel PT decoder to correlate the timestamps and
translate the virtual machine timestamps to host timestamps.

The advantages of making this a separate step, rather than a part of
normal decoding are that it is simpler to implement, and it needs to
be done only once.

This patch adds only the option. Later patches add Intel PT support.
