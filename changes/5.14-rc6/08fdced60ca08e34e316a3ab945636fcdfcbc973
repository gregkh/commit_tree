ALSA: rawmidi: Add framing mode

This commit adds a new framing mode that frames all MIDI data into
32-byte frames with a timestamp.

The main benefit is that we can get accurate timestamps even if
userspace wakeup and processing is not immediate.

Testing on a Celeron N3150 with this mode has a max jitter of 2.8 ms,
compared to the in-kernel seq implementation which has a max jitter
of 5 ms during idle and much worse when running scheduler stress tests
in parallel.
