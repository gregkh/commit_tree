ARM: dts: sun8i: r40: add pinmux settings for MMC3 and UARTs 2, 4, 5&7

The Forlinx OKA40i-C devboard makes use of UARTs 0,2,3,4,5 and 7 of the R40
SoC, of which UART 0 is connected to an RS232 converter, UART 5 routed to
an RS485 converter, and the rest broken out directly via labeled headers.
The board also contains a micro-SD slot connected to SDC3.

This patch adds settings to R40's pinmux node for MMC3 and those UARTs that
were not already mapped, which would allow us to make use of all available
UARTs and the micro-SD slot on this board in a further patch.
