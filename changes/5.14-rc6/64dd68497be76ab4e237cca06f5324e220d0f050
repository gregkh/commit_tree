mm: slub: move sysfs slab alloc/free interfaces to debugfs

alloc_calls and free_calls implementation in sysfs have two issues, one is
PAGE_SIZE limitation of sysfs and other is it does not adhere to "one
value per file" rule.

To overcome this issues, move the alloc_calls and free_calls
implementation to debugfs.

Debugfs cache will be created if SLAB_STORE_USER flag is set.

Rename the alloc_calls/free_calls to alloc_traces/free_traces, to be
inline with what it does.
