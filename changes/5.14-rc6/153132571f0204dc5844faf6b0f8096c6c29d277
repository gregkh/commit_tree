userfaultfd/shmem: support UFFDIO_CONTINUE for shmem

With this change, userspace can resolve a minor fault within a
shmem-backed area with a UFFDIO_CONTINUE ioctl.  The semantics for this
match those for hugetlbfs - we look up the existing page in the page
cache, and install a PTE for it.

This commit introduces a new helper: mfill_atomic_install_pte.

Why handle UFFDIO_CONTINUE for shmem in mm/userfaultfd.c, instead of in
shmem.c?  The existing userfault implementation only relies on shmem.c for
VM_SHARED VMAs.  However, minor fault handling / CONTINUE work just fine
for !VM_SHARED VMAs as well.  We'd prefer to handle CONTINUE for shmem in
one place, regardless of shared/private (to reduce code duplication).

Why add a new mfill_atomic_install_pte helper?  A problem we have with
continue is that shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() and mcopy_atomic_pte() are
*close* to what we want, but not exactly.  We do want to setup the PTEs in
a CONTINUE operation, but we don't want to e.g.  allocate a new page,
charge it (e.g.  to the shmem inode), manipulate various flags, etc.  Also
we have the problem stated above: shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() and
mcopy_atomic_pte() both handle one-half of the problem (shared / private)
continue cares about.  So, introduce mcontinue_atomic_pte(), to handle all
of the shmem continue cases.  Introduce the helper so it doesn't duplicate
code with mcopy_atomic_pte().

In a future commit, shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() will also be modified to use
this new helper.  However, since this is a bigger refactor, it seems most
clear to do it as a separate change.
