HID: input: Add support for Programmable Buttons

Map them to KEY_MACRO# event codes.

These buttons are defined by HID as follows:
"The user defines the function of these buttons to control software applications or GUI objects."

This matches the semantics of the KEY_MACRO# input event codes that Linux supports.

Also add support for HID "Named Array" collections.
Also add hid-debug support for KEY_MACRO#.
