docs: Activate exCJK only in CJK chapters

Activating xeCJK in English and Italian-translation documents
results in sub-optimal typesetting with wide-looking apostrophes
and quotation marks.

The xeCJK package provides macros for enabling and disabling its
effect in the middle of a document, namely \makexeCJKactive and
\makexeCJKinactive.

So the goal of this change is to activate xeCJK in the relevant
chapters in translations.

To do this:

    o Define custom macros in the preamble depending on the
      availability of the "Noto Sans CJK" font so that those
      macros can be used regardless of the use of xeCJK package.

    o Patch \sphinxtableofcontents so that xeCJK is inactivated
      after table of contents.

    o Embed those custom macros in each language's index.rst file
      as a ".. raw:: latex" construct.

Note: A CJK chapter needs \kerneldocCJKon in front of its chapter
heading, while a non-CJK chapter should have \kerneldocCJKoff
below its chapter heading.

This is to make sure the CJK font is available to CJK chapter's
heading and ending page's footer.

Tested against Sphinx versions 2.4.4 and 4.0.2.
