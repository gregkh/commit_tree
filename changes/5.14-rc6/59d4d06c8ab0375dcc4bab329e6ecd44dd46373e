usb: typec: tcpm: Move TCPC to APPLY_RC state during PR_SWAP

When vbus auto discharge is enabled, TCPCI based TCPC transitions
into Attached.SNK/Attached.SRC state. During PR_SWAP, TCPCI based
TCPC would disconnect when partner changes power roles. TCPC has
to be moved APPLY RC state during PR_SWAP. This is done by
ROLE_CONTROL.CC1 != ROLE_CONTROL.CC2 and
POWER_CONTROL.AutodischargeDisconnect is 0. Once the swap sequence
is done, AutoDischargeDisconnect is re-enabled.
