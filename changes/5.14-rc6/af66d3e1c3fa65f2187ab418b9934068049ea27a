selftests: mptcp: enable checksum in mptcp_join.sh

This patch added a new argument "-C" for the mptcp_join.sh script to set
the sysctl checksum_enabled to 1 in ns1 and ns2 to enable the data
checksum.

In chk_join_nr, check the counter of the mib for the data checksum.

Also added a new argument "-S" for the mptcp_join.sh script to start the
test cases that verify the checksum handshake:

  * Sender and listener both have checksums off
  * Sender and listener both have checksums on
  * Sender checksums off, listener checksums on
  * Sender checksums on, listener checksums off

The output looks like this:

 01 checksum test 0 0                  sum[ ok ] - csum  [ ok ]
 02 checksum test 1 1                  sum[ ok ] - csum  [ ok ]
 03 checksum test 0 1                  sum[ ok ] - csum  [ ok ]
 04 checksum test 1 0                  sum[ ok ] - csum  [ ok ]
 05 no JOIN                            syn[ ok ] - synack[ ok ] - ack[ ok ]
                                       sum[ ok ] - csum  [ ok ]
 06 single subflow, limited by client  syn[ ok ] - synack[ ok ] - ack[ ok ]
                                       sum[ ok ] - csum  [ ok ]
