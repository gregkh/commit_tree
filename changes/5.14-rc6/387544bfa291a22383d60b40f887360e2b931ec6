bpf: Introduce fd_idx

Typical program loading sequence involves creating bpf maps and applying
map FDs into bpf instructions in various places in the bpf program.
This job is done by libbpf that is using compiler generated ELF relocations
to patch certain instruction after maps are created and BTFs are loaded.
The goal of fd_idx is to allow bpf instructions to stay immutable
after compilation. At load time the libbpf would still create maps as usual,
but it wouldn't need to patch instructions. It would store map_fds into
__u32 fd_array[] and would pass that pointer to sys_bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD).
