platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Consolidate node groups for 5th- and 6th-gen devices

5th- and 6th-generation Surface devices have all SAM clients defined in
ACPI, except for the platform profile/performance mode which his handled
via the WSID (Windows Surface Integration Device). Thus, the node groups
for those devices are the same and we can just use a single one instead
of re-defining the same one over and over again.
