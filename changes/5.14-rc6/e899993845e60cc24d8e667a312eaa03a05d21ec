memory: tegra: Unify struct tegra_mc across SoC generations

As another step towards unifying both the Tegra210 (and earlier) and
Tegra186 (and later) memory controller drivers, unify the structures
that are used to represent them.

Note that this comes at a slight space penalty since some fields are
not used on all generations, but the benefits of unifying the driver
outweigh the downsides.
