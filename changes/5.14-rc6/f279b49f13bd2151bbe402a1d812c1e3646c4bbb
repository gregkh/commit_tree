x86/boot: Modernize genimage script; hdimage+EFI support

The image generation scripts in arch/x86/boot are pretty out of date,
except for the isoimage target. Update and clean up the
genimage.sh script, and make it support an arbitrary number of
initramfs files in the image.

Add a "hdimage" target, which can be booted by either BIOS or
EFI (if the kernel is compiled with the EFI stub.) For EFI to be able
to pass the command line to the kernel, we need the EFI shell, but the
firmware builtin EFI shell, if it even exists, is pretty much always
the last resort boot option, so search for OVMF or EDK2 and explicitly
include a copy of the EFI shell.

To make this all work, use bash features in the script.  Furthermore,
this version of the script makes use of some mtools features,
especially mpartition, that might not exist in very old version of
mtools, but given all the other dependencies on this script this
doesn't seem such a big deal.

Finally, put a volume label ("LINUX_BOOT") on all generated images.
