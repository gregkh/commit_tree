arm64: assembler: replace `kaddr` with `addr`

The `__dcache_op_workaround_clean_cache` and `dcache_by_line_op` macros
are only expected to be usedc on kernel memory, without a user fault
fixup, and so we named their address variables `kaddr` to make this
clear.

Subseuqent patches will modify these to also work on user memory with an
(optional) user fault fixup, where `kaddr` won't make as much sense. To
aid the legibility of patches, this patch (only) replaces `kaddr` with
`addr` as a preparatory step.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
