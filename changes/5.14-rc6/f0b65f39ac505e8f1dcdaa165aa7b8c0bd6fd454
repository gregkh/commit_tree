iov_iter: replace iov_iter_copy_from_user_atomic() with iterator-advancing variant

Replacement is called copy_page_from_iter_atomic(); unlike the old primitive the
callers do *not* need to do iov_iter_advance() after it.  In case when they end
up consuming less than they'd been given they need to do iov_iter_revert() on
everything they had not consumed.  That, however, needs to be done only on slow
paths.

All in-tree callers converted.  And that kills the last user of iterate_all_kinds()
