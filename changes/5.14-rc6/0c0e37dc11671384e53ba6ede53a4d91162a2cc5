x86/ioapic: Force affinity setup before startup

The IO/APIC cannot handle interrupt affinity changes safely after startup
other than from an interrupt handler. The startup sequence in the generic
interrupt code violates that assumption.

Mark the irq chip with the new IRQCHIP_AFFINITY_PRE_STARTUP flag so that
the default interrupt setting happens before the interrupt is started up
for the first time.
