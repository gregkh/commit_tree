pinctrl: mediatek: don't hardcode mode encoding in common code

MT8365 encode the pins mode differently than other
MTK pinctrl drivers that use the PINCTRL_MTK common code.

Add 3 new fields in mtk_pinctrl_devdata in order to store how
pin modes are encoded into the register. At the
same time update all the pinctrl driver that depends on
CONFIG_PINCTRL_MTK.
