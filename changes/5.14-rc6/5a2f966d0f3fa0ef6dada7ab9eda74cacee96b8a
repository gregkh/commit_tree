virtio_net: move tx vq operation under tx queue lock

It's unsafe to operate a vq from multiple threads.
Unfortunately this is exactly what we do when invoking
clean tx poll from rx napi.
Same happens with napi-tx even without the
opportunistic cleaning from the receive interrupt: that races
with processing the vq in start_xmit.

As a fix move everything that deals with the vq to under tx lock.
