fs: dlm: fix connection tcp EOF handling

This patch fixes the EOF handling for TCP that if and EOF is received we
will close the socket next time the writequeue runs empty. This is a
half-closed socket functionality which doesn't exists in SCTP. The
midcomms layer will do a half closed socket functionality on DLM side to
solve this problem for the SCTP case. However there is still the last ack
flying around but other reset functionality will take care of it if it got
lost.
