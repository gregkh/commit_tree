arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-oneplus-common: guard rmtfs-mem

The rmtfs_mem region is a weird one, downstream allocates it
dynamically, and supports a "qcom,guard-memory" property which when set
will reserve 4k above and below the rmtfs memory.

A common from qcom 4.9 kernel msm_sharedmem driver:

/*
 * If guard_memory is set, then the shared memory region
 * will be guarded by SZ_4K at the start and at the end.
 * This is needed to overcome the XPU limitation on few
 * MSM HW, so as to make this memory not contiguous with
 * other allocations that may possibly happen from other
 * clients in the system.
*/

When the kernel tries to touch memory that is too close the
rmtfs region it may cause an XPU violation. Such is the case on the
OnePlus 6 where random crashes would occur usually after boot.

Reserve 4k above and below the rmtfs_mem to avoid hitting these XPU
Violations.

This doesn't entirely solve the random crashes on the OnePlus 6/6T but
it does seem to prevent the ones which happen shortly after modem
bringup.
