net: dsa: microchip: ksz8795: Fix PVID tag insertion

ksz8795 has never actually enabled PVID tag insertion, and it also
programmed the PVID incorrectly.  To fix this:

* Allow tag insertion to be controlled per ingress port.  On most
  chips, set bit 2 in Global Control 19.  On KSZ88x3 this control
  flag doesn't exist.

* When adding a PVID:
  - Set the appropriate register bits to enable tag insertion on
    egress at every other port if this was the packet's ingress port.
  - Mask *out* the VID from the default tag, before or-ing in the new
    PVID.

* When removing a PVID:
  - Clear the same control bits to disable tag insertion.
  - Don't update the default tag.  This wasn't doing anything useful.
