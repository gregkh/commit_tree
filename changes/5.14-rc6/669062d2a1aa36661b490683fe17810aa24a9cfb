KVM: arm64: vgic: Be tolerant to the lack of maintenance interrupt masking

As it turns out, not all the interrupt controllers are able to
expose a vGIC maintenance interrupt that can be independently
enabled/disabled.

And to be fair, it doesn't really matter as all we require is
for the interrupt to kick us out of guest mode out way or another.

To that effect, add gic_kvm_info.no_maint_irq_mask for an interrupt
controller to advertise the lack of masking.
