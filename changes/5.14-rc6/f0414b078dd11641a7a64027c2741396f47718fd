Revert "KVM: x86: WARN and reject loading KVM if NX is supported but not enabled"

Let KVM load if EFER.NX=0 even if NX is supported, the analysis and
testing (or lack thereof) for the non-PAE host case was garbage.

If the kernel won't be using PAE paging, .Ldefault_entry in head_32.S
skips over the entire EFER sequence.  Hopefully that can be changed in
the future to allow KVM to require EFER.NX, but the motivation behind
KVM's requirement isn't yet merged.  Reverting and revisiting the mess
at a later date is by far the safest approach.

This reverts commit 8bbed95d2cb6e5de8a342d761a89b0a04faed7be.
