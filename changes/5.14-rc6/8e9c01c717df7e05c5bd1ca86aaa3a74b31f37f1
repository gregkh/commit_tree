srcu: Initialize SRCU after timers

Once srcu_init() is called, the SRCU core will make use of delayed
workqueues, which rely on timers.  However init_timers() is called
several steps after rcu_init().  This means that a call_srcu() after
rcu_init() but before init_timers() would find itself within a dangerously
uninitialized timer core.

This commit therefore creates a separate call to srcu_init() after
init_timer() completes, which ensures that we stay in early SRCU mode
until timers are safe(r).
