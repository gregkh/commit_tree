arm64: dts: renesas: condor: Switch eMMC bus to 1V8

The eMMC card has two supplies, VCC and VCCQ. The VCC supplies the NAND
array and the VCCQ supplies the bus. On Condor, the VCC is connected to
3.3V rail, while the VCCQ is connected to 1.8V rail. Adjust the pinmux
to match the bus, which is always operating in 1.8V mode.

While at it, deduplicate the pinmux entries, which are now the same for
both default and UHS modes. We still need the two pinctrl entries to
match the bindings though.

Thanks to Marek Vasut for this description from commit 5f65328df3f5cd25
("arm64: dts: renesas: Switch eMMC bus to 1V8 on Salvator-X and ULCB").
