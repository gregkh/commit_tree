arm64: dts: rockchip: Enable USB3 for rk3328 ROC-RK3328-CC

Enable USB3 nodes for the ROC-RK3328-CC board.

The separate power regulator is not added as it is controlled by the
same GPIO line as the existing VBUS regulators, so it is already
enabled. Also there is no port representation to tie the regulator to.
