io-wq: fix bug of creating io-wokers unconditionally

The former patch to add check between nr_workers and max_workers has a
bug, which will cause unconditionally creating io-workers. That's
because the result of the check doesn't affect the call of
create_io_worker(), fix it by bringing in a boolean value for it.
