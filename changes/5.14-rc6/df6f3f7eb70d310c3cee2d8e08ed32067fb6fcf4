power: supply: bq24190_charger: drop of_match_ptr() from device ID table

The driver can match only via the DT table so the table should be always
used and the of_match_ptr() does not have any sense (this also allows ACPI
matching via PRP0001, even though it might be not relevant here). This
fixes compile warning (!CONFIG_OF):

  drivers/power/supply/bq24190_charger.c:1972:34: warning: ‘bq24190_of_match’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
