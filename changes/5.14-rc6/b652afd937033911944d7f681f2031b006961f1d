xfs: get rid of xfs_dir_ialloc()

This is just a simple wrapper around the per-ag inode allocation
that doesn't need to exist. The internal mechanism to select and
allocate within an AG does not need to be exposed outside
xfs_ialloc.c, and it being exposed simply makes it harder to follow
the code and simplify it.

This is simplified by internalising xf_dialloc_select_ag() and
xfs_dialloc_ag() into a single xfs_dialloc() function and then
xfs_dir_ialloc() can go away.
