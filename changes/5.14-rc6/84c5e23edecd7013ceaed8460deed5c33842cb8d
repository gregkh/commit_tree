arm64: mm: Pass original fault address to handle_mm_fault()

Currently, the lower bits of fault address is cleared before it's
passed to handle_mm_fault(). It's unnecessary since generic code
does same thing since the commit 1a29d85eb0f19 ("mm: use vmf->address
instead of of vmf->virtual_address").

This passes the original fault address to handle_mm_fault() in case
the generic code needs to know the exact fault address.
