KVM: SVM: hyper-v: Enlightened MSR-Bitmap support

Enlightened MSR-Bitmap as per TLFS:

 "The L1 hypervisor may collaborate with the L0 hypervisor to make MSR
  accesses more efficient. It can enable enlightened MSR bitmaps by setting
  the corresponding field in the enlightened VMCS to 1. When enabled, L0
  hypervisor does not monitor the MSR bitmaps for changes. Instead, the L1
  hypervisor must invalidate the corresponding clean field after making
  changes to one of the MSR bitmaps."

Enable this for SVM.
