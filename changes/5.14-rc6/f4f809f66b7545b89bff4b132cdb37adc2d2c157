cgroup: inline cgroup_task_freeze()

After the introduction of the cgroup.kill there is only one call site
of cgroup_task_freeze() left: cgroup_exit(). cgroup_task_freeze() is
currently taking rcu_read_lock() to read task's cgroup flags, but
because it's always called with css_set_lock locked, the rcu protection
is excessive.

Simplify the code by inlining cgroup_task_freeze().
