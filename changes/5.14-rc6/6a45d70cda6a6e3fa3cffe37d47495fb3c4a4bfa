dt-bindings: mmc: sdhci-am654: Remove duplicate ti,j721e-sdhci-4bit

The commit 7c7905df68c5 ("dt-bindings: mmc: sdhci-am654: fix compatible
for j7200") switched the compatible property from a regular enum to an
more appropriate combinatorial oneOf convention, and in the process has
introduced a duplicate ti,j721e-sdhci-4bit.

This generated the following warning on J721E boards that use the
ti,j721e-sdhci-4bit for two nodes:
 "mmc@4fb0000: compatible: More than one condition true in oneOf schema"
 "mmc@4f98000: compatible: More than one condition true in oneOf schema"

Remove the duplicate to fix this.
