RDMA/mlx5: Remove redundant assignment to ret

Variable 'ret' is set to the rerurn value of function
mlx5_mr_cache_alloc() but this value is never read as it is overwritten
with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant assignment and can be
removed

Clean up the following clang-analyzer warning:

 drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/odp.c:421:2: warning: Value stored to 'ret' is never read [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]

Fixes: e6fb246ccafb ("RDMA/mlx5: Consolidate MR destruction to mlx5_ib_dereg_mr()")
