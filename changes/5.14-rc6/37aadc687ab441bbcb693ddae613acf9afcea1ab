sched: Unbreak wakeups

Remove broken task->state references and let wake_up_process() DTRT.

The anti-pattern in these patches breaks the ordering of ->state vs
COND as described in the comment near set_current_state() and can lead
to missed wakeups:

	(OoO load, observes RUNNING)<-.
	for (;;) {                    |
	  t->state = UNINTERRUPTIBLE; |
	  smp_mb();          ,----->  | (observes !COND)
                             |        /
	  if (COND) ---------'       |	COND = 1;
		break;		     `- if (t->state != RUNNING)
					  wake_up_process(t); // not done
	  schedule(); // forever waiting
	}
	t->state = TASK_RUNNING;
