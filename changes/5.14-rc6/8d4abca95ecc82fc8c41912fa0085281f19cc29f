media: ngene: Fix out-of-bounds bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf()

Fix an 11-year old bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf() while
addressing the following warnings caught with -Warray-bounds:

arch/alpha/include/asm/string.h:22:16: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]
arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:182:25: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]

The problem is that the original code is trying to copy 6 bytes of
data into a one-byte size member _config_ of the wrong structue
FW_CONFIGURE_BUFFERS, in a single call to memcpy(). This causes a
legitimate compiler warning because memcpy() overruns the length
of &com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config. It seems that the right
structure is FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS, instead, because it contains
6 more members apart from the header _hdr_. Also, the name of
the function ngene_command_config_free_buf() suggests that the actual
intention is to ConfigureFreeBuffers, instead of ConfigureBuffers
(which takes place in the function ngene_command_config_buf(), above).

Fix this by enclosing those 6 members of struct FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS
into new struct config, and use &com.cmd.ConfigureFreeBuffers.config as
the destination address, instead of &com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config,
when calling memcpy().

This also helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable
-Warray-bounds and get us closer to being able to tighten the
FORTIFY_SOURCE routines on memcpy().
