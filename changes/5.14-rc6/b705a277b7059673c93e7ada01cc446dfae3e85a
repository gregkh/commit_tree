KVM: x86/mmu: Drop vCPU param from reserved bits calculator

Drop the vCPU param from __reset_rsvds_bits_mask() as it's now unused,
and ideally will remain unused in the future.  Any information that's
needed by the low level helper should be explicitly provided as it's used
for both shadow/host MMUs and guest MMUs, i.e. vCPU state may be
meaningless or simply wrong.
