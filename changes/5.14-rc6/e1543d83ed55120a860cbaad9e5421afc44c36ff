drm/amdgpu: Fix crash when hot unplug in BACO

Problem:
When device goes into runtime suspend due to prolonged
inactivity (e.g. BACO sleep) and then hot unplugged,
PCI core will try to wake up the device as part of
unplug process. Since the device is gone all HW
programming during rpm resume fails leading
to a bad SW state later during pci remove handling.

Fix:
Use a flag we use for PCIe error recovery to avoid
accessing registres. This allows to successfully complete
rpm resume sequence and finish pci remove.

v2: Renamed HW access block flag
