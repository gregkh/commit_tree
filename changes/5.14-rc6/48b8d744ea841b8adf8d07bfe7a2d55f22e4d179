hugetlb: remove prep_compound_huge_page cleanup

Patch series "Fix prep_compound_gigantic_page ref count adjustment".

These patches address the possible race between
prep_compound_gigantic_page and __page_cache_add_speculative as described
by Jann Horn in [1].

The first patch simply removes the unnecessary/obsolete helper routine
prep_compound_huge_page to make the actual fix a little simpler.

The second patch is the actual fix and has a detailed explanation in the
commit message.

This potential issue has existed for almost 10 years and I am unaware of
anyone actually hitting the race.  I did not cc stable, but would be happy
to squash the patches and send to stable if anyone thinks that is a good
idea.

This patch (of 2):

I could not think of a reliable way to recreate the issue for testing.
Rather, I 'simulated errors' to exercise all the error paths.

The routine prep_compound_huge_page is a simple wrapper to call either
prep_compound_gigantic_page or prep_compound_page.  However, it is only
called from gather_bootmem_prealloc which only processes gigantic pages.
Eliminate the routine and call prep_compound_gigantic_page directly.
