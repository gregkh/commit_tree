iio: adc: Fix incorrect exit of for-loop

Currently the for-loop that scans for the optimial adc_period iterates
through all the possible adc_period levels because the exit logic in
the loop is inverted. I believe the comparison should be swapped and
the continue replaced with a break to exit the loop at the correct
point.
