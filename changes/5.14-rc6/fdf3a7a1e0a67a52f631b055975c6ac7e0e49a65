riscv: Fix comment regarding kernel mapping overlapping with IS_ERR_VALUE

The current comment states that we check if the 64-bit kernel mapping
overlaps with the last 4K of the address space that is reserved to
error values in create_kernel_page_table, which is not the case since it
is done in setup_vm. But anyway, remove the reference to any function
and simply note that in 64-bit kernel, the check should be done as soon
as the kernel mapping base address is known.
