net: phy: micrel: Fix link detection on ksz87xx switch"

Commit a5e63c7d38d5 "net: phy: micrel: Fix detection of ksz87xx
switch" broke link detection on the external ports of the KSZ8795.

The previously unused phy_driver structure for these devices specifies
config_aneg and read_status functions that appear to be designed for a
fixed link and do not work with the embedded PHYs in the KSZ8795.

Delete the use of these functions in favour of the generic PHY
implementations which were used previously.
