ARM: dts: meson: Set the fifo-size of uart_A to 128 bytes

The first UART controller in the "Everything-Else" power domain is
called uart_A. Unlike all other UARTs (which use a 64 byte fifo-size in
hardware) uart_A has a fifo-size of 128 bytes. This UART controller is
typically used for Bluetooth HCI.
The fifo-size of 128 bytes is valid from all SoCs from Meson6 (or
possibly even earlier) all the way up to the latest 64-bit ones.
