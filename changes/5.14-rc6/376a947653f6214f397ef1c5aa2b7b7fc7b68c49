tools headers UAPI: Sync files changed by the memfd_secret new syscall

To pick the changes in this cset:

  7bb7f2ac24a028b2 ("arch, mm: wire up memfd_secret system call where relevant")

That silences these perf build warnings and add support for those new
syscalls in tools such as 'perf trace'.

For instance, this is now possible:

  # perf trace -v -e memfd_secret
  event qualifier tracepoint filter: (common_pid != 13375 && common_pid != 3713) && (id == 447)
  ^C#

That is the filter expression attached to the raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit}
tracepoints.

  $ grep memfd_secret tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
  447    common  memfd_secret            sys_memfd_secret
  $

This addresses these perf build warnings:
