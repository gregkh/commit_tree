pinctrl: tigerlake: Fix GPIO mapping for newer version of software

The software mapping for GPIO, which initially comes from Microsoft,
is subject to change by respective Windows and firmware developers.
Due to the above the driver had been written and published way ahead
of the schedule, and thus the numbering schema used in it is outdated.

Fix the numbering schema in accordance with the real products on market.
