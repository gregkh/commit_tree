net/mlx5: DR, Add fail on error check on decap

While processing encapsulated packet on RX, one of the fields that is
checked is the inner packet length. If the length as specified in the header
doesn't match the actual inner packet length, the packet is invalid
and should be dropped. However, such packet caused the NIC to hang.

This patch turns on a 'fail_on_error' HW bit which allows HW to drop
such an invalid packet while processing RX packet and trying to decap it.
