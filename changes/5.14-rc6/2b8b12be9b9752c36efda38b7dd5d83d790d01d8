ALSA: scarlett2: Fix line out/speaker switching notifications

The values of the line output controls can change when the SW/HW
switches are set to HW, and also when speaker switching is enabled.
These notifications were sent with a mask of only
SNDRV_CTL_EVENT_MASK_INFO. Change the notifications to set the
SNDRV_CTL_EVENT_MASK_VALUE mask bit as well.

When the mute control is updated, the notification was sent with a
mask of SNDRV_CTL_EVENT_MASK_INFO. Change the mask to the correct
value of SNDRV_CTL_EVENT_MASK_VALUE.
