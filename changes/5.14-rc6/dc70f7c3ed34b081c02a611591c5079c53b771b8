RDMA/cma: Remove unnecessary INIT->INIT transition

In rdma_create_qp(), a connected QP will be transitioned to the INIT
state.

Afterwards, the QP will be transitioned to the RTR state by the
cma_modify_qp_rtr() function. But this function starts by performing an
ib_modify_qp() to the INIT state again, before another ib_modify_qp() is
performed to transition the QP to the RTR state.

Hence, there is no need to transition the QP to the INIT state in
rdma_create_qp().
