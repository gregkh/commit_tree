MIPS: ralink: Define PCI_IOBASE

PCI_IOBASE is used to create VM maps for PCI I/O ports, it is
required by generic PCI drivers to make memory mapped I/O range
work. Hence define it for ralink architectures to be able to
avoid parsing manually IO ranges in PCI generic driver code.
Function 'plat_mem_setup' for ralink is using 'set_io_port_base'
call using '0xa0000000' as address, so use the same address in
the definition to align things.
