platform/x86: intel_skl_int3472: Uninitialized variable in skl_int3472_handle_gpio_resources()

This function returns negative error codes, zero (to indicate that
everything has been completed successfully) and one (to indicate that
more resources need to be handled still).

This code prints an uninitialized error message when the function
returns one which potentially leads to an Oops.
