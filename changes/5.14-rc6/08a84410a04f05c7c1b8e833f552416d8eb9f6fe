serial: sh-sci: Stop dmaengine transfer in sci_stop_tx()

Stop dmaengine transfer in sci_stop_tx(). Otherwise, the following
message is possible output when system enters suspend and while
transferring data, because clearing TIE bit in SCSCR is not able to
stop any dmaengine transfer.

    sh-sci e6550000.serial: ttySC1: Unable to drain transmitter

Note that this driver has already used some #ifdef in the .c file
so that this patch also uses #ifdef to fix the issue. Otherwise,
build errors happens if the CONFIG_SERIAL_SH_SCI_DMA is disabled.
