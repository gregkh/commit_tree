mm/z3fold: avoid possible underflow in z3fold_alloc()

It is not enough to just make sure the z3fold header is not larger than
the page size.  When z3fold header is equal to PAGE_SIZE, we would
underflow when check alloc size against PAGE_SIZE - ZHDR_SIZE_ALIGNED -
CHUNK_SIZE in z3fold_alloc().  Make sure there has remaining spaces for
its buddy to fix this theoretical issue.
