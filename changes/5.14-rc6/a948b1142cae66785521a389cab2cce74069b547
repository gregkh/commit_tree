NFSD: Fix TP_printk() format specifier in nfsd_clid_class

Since commit 9a6944fee68e ("tracing: Add a verifier to check string
pointers for trace events"), which was merged in v5.13-rc1,
TP_printk() no longer tacitly supports the "%.*s" format specifier.

These are low value tracepoints, so just remove them.
