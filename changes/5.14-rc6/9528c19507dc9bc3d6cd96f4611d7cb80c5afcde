tracing: Clean up alloc_synth_event()

alloc_synth_event() currently has the following code to initialize the
event fields and dynamic_fields:

	for (i = 0, j = 0; i < n_fields; i++) {
		event->fields[i] = fields[i];

		if (fields[i]->is_dynamic) {
			event->dynamic_fields[j] = fields[i];
			event->dynamic_fields[j]->field_pos = i;
			event->dynamic_fields[j++] = fields[i];
			event->n_dynamic_fields++;
		}
	}

1) It would make more sense to have all fields keep track of their
   field_pos.

2) event->dynmaic_fields[j] is assigned twice for no reason.

3) We can move updating event->n_dynamic_fields outside the loop, and just
   assign it to j.

This combination makes the code much cleaner.
