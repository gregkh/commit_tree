ARM: configs: Update Vexpress defconfig

This updates the Versatile Express defconfig for the changes
in the v5.14-rc1 kernel:

- The Framebuffer CONFIG_FB needs to be explicitly selected
  or we don't get any framebuffer anymore. DRM has stopped to
  select FB because of circular dependency.
- CONFIG_CMA options were moved around.
- CONFIG_MODULES options were moved around.
- CONFIG_CRYPTO_HW was moved around.

Fixes: f611b1e7624c ("drm: Avoid circular dependencies for CONFIG_FB")
