KVM: use cpu_relax when halt polling

SMT siblings share caches and other hardware, and busy halt polling
will degrade its sibling performance if its sibling is working

Sean Christopherson suggested as below:

"Rather than disallowing halt-polling entirely, on x86 it should be
sufficient to simply have the hardware thread yield to its sibling(s)
via PAUSE.  It probably won't get back all performance, but I would
expect it to be close.
This compiles on all KVM architectures, and AFAICT the intended usage
of cpu_relax() is identical for all architectures."
