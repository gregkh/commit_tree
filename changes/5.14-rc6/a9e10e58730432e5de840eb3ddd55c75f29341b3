ACPI: scan: Extend acpi_walk_dep_device_list()

The acpi_walk_dep_device_list() function is not as generic as its
name implies, serving only to decrement the dependency count for each
dependent device of the input.

Extend it to accept a callback which can be applied to all the
dependencies in acpi_dep_list.

Replace all existing calls to the function with calls to a wrapper,
passing a callback that applies the same dependency reduction.
