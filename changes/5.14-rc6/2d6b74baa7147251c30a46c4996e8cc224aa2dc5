perf map: Fix dso->nsinfo refcounting

ASan reports a memory leak of nsinfo during the execution of

  # perf test "31: Lookup mmap thread"

The leak is caused by a refcounted variable being replaced without
dropping the refcount.

This patch makes sure that the refcnt of nsinfo is decreased whenever a
refcounted variable is replaced with a new value.
