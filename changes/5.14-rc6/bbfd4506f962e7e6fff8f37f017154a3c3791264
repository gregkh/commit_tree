net: hns3: fix rx VLAN offload state inconsistent issue

Currently, VF doesn't enable rx VLAN offload when initializating,
and PF does it for VFs. If user disable the rx VLAN offload for
VF with ethtool -K, and reload the VF driver, it may cause the
rx VLAN offload state being inconsistent between hardware and
software.

Fixes it by enabling rx VLAN offload when VF initializing.
