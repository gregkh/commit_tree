powerpc/64s: Fix boot failure with 4K Radix

When using the Radix MMU our PGD is always 64K, and must be naturally
aligned.

For a 4K page size kernel that means page alignment of swapper_pg_dir is
not sufficient, leading to failure to boot.

Use the existing MAX_PTRS_PER_PGD which has the correct value, and
avoids us hard-coding 64K here.
