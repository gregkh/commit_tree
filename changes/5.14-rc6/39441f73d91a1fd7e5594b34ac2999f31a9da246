arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: lazor: Simplify disabling of charger thermal zone

Commit f73558cc83d1 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Disable charger
thermal zone for lazor") disables the charger thermal zone for
specific lazor revisions due to an unsupported thermistor type.
The initial idea was to disable the thermal zone for older
revisions and leave it enabled for newer ones that use a
supported thermistor. Finally the thermistor won't be changed
on newer revisions, hence the thermal zone should be disabled
for all lazor (and limozeen) revisions. Instead of disabling
it per revision do it once in the shared .dtsi for lazor.
