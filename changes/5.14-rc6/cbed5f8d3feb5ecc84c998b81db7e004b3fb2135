arm64: entry: move bad_mode() to entry-common.c

In subsequent patches we'll rework the way bad_mode() is called by
exception entry code. In preparation for this, let's move bad_mode()
itself into entry-common.c.

Let's also mark it as noinstr (e.g. to prevent it being kprobed), and
let's also make the `handler` array a local variable, as this is only
use by bad_mode(), and will be removed entirely in a subsequent patch.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
