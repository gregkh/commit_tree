PSCI: Use cpuidle context helpers in psci_cpu_suspend_enter()

The PSCI CPU suspend code isn't aware of the PMR vs DAIF game,
resulting in a system that locks up if entering CPU suspend
with GICv3 pNMI enabled.

To save the day, teach the suspend code about our new cpuidle
context helpers, which will do everything that's required just
like the usual WFI cpuidle code.

This fixes my Altra system, which would otherwise lock-up at
boot time when booted with irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi=1.
