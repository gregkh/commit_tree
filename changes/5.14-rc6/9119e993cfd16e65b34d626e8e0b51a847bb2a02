drm/amd/display: Handle potential dpp_inst mismatch with pipe_idx

[Why]
In some pipe harvesting configs, we will select the incorrect
dpp_inst when programming DTO. This is because when any intermediate
pipe is fused, resource instances are no longer in 1:1
correspondence with pipe index.

[How]
When looping through pipes to program DTO, get the dpp_inst
associated with each pipe from res_pool.
