locking/atomic: h8300: use asm-generic exclusively

As h8300's implementation of the atomics isn't using any arch-specific
functionality, and its implementation of cmpxchg only uses assembly to
non-atomically swap two elements in memory, we may as well use the
asm-generic atomic.h and cmpxchg.h, and avoid the duplicate code.
