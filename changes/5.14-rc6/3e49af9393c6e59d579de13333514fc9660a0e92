scsi: lpfc: Add a option to enable interlocked ABTS before job completion

Default behavior for the driver, when aborting an I/O, is to terminate the
I/O with the adapter. The adapter will initiate an ABTS to terminate the
exchange on the link and mark the exchange is terminated so that no further
use of the sgl or any traffic for the exchange is worked on. Completion on
the Abort is then posted to the driver, which as the I/O is terminated can
complete the I/O to the OS. This completion may occur prior to the ABTS
handshake completing on the wire. The ABTS handshake can take a long time
to complete with timeouts and retries reaching 60+ seconds. Note: if
retries fail, LOGO occurs.

Some devices want to ensure that the ABTS handshake fully completes (this
device has fully ack'd it) before the I/O completion is posted back to the
OS, where a failed I/O may be retried via a different path.

To support this behavior, an option was added to the driver to change I/O
completion from the Abort cmd completion to the Exchange termination (aka
ABTS) completion.
