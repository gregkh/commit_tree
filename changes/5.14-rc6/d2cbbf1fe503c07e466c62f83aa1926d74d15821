ACPI: Kconfig: Fix table override from built-in initrd

During a rework of initramfs code the INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION config
option was removed in commit 65e00e04e5ae. A leftover as a dependency
broke the config option ACPI_TABLE_OVERRIDE_VIA_ BUILTIN_INITRD that
is used to enable the overriding of ACPI tables from built-in initrd.
Fixing the dependency.
