ASoC: cs42l42: Constrain sample rate to prevent illegal SCLK

The lowest valid SCLK corresponds to 44.1 kHz at 16-bit. Sample
rates less than this would produce SCLK below the minimum when using
a normal I2S frame. A constraint must be applied to prevent this.

The constraint is not applied if the machine driver sets SCLK, to
allow setups where the host generates additional bits per LRCLK
phase to increase the SCLK frequency. In these cases the machine
driver would always have to inform this driver of the actual SCLK,
and it must select a legal SCLK.
