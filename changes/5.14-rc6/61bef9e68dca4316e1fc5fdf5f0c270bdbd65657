ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: enforce exclusion between HDaudio and SoundWire

On some platforms with an external HDaudio codec, the DSDT reports the
presence of SoundWire devices. Pin-mux restrictions and board reworks
usually prevent coexistence between the two types of links, let's
prevent unnecessary operations from starting.

In the case of a single iDISP codec being detected, we still start the
links even if no SoundWire machine configuration was detected, so that
we can double-check what the hardware is and add the missing
configuration if applicable.
