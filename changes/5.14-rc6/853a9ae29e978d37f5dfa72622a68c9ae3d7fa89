serial: 8250: fix handle_irq locking

The 8250 handle_irq callback is not just called from the interrupt
handler but also from a timer callback when polling (e.g. for ports
without an interrupt line). Consequently the callback must explicitly
disable interrupts to avoid a potential deadlock with another interrupt
in polled mode.

Add back an irqrestore-version of the sysrq port-unlock helper and use
it in the 8250 callbacks that need it.
