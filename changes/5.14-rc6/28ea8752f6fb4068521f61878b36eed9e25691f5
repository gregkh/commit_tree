drm/amd/display: remove unused function dc_link_perform_link_training

This function is not used anywhere, remove it. It was added in
40dd6bd376a4 ("drm/amd/display: Linux Set/Read link rate and lane count
through debugfs") and moved in fe798de53a7a ("drm/amd/display: Move link
functions from dc to dc_link"), but a user is missing.
