iwlwifi: mvm: support LONG_GROUP for WOWLAN_GET_STATUSES version

It's been a while that the firmware uses LONG_GROUP by default
and not LEGACY_GROUP.
Until now the firmware wrongly advertise the WOWLAN_GET_STATUS
command's version with LEGACY_GROUP, but it is now being fixed.
In order to support both firmwares, first try to get the version
number of the command with the LONG_GROUP and if the firmware
didn't advertise the command version with LONG_GROUP, try to get
the command version with LEGACY_GROUP.
