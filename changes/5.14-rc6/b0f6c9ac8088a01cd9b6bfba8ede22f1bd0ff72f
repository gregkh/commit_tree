netpoll: don't require irqs disabled in rt kernels

write_msg(netconsole.c:836) calls netpoll_send_udp after a call to
spin_lock_irqsave, which normally disables interrupts; but in PREEMPT_RT
this call just locks an rt_mutex without disabling irqs. In this case,
netpoll_send_udp is called with interrupts enabled.
