selftests/bpf: Fix ringbuf test fetching map FD

Seems like 4d1b62986125 ("selftests/bpf: Convert few tests to light skeleton.")
and 704e2beba23c ("selftests/bpf: Test ringbuf mmap read-only and read-write
restrictions") were done independently on bpf and bpf-next trees and are in
conflict with each other, despite a clean merge. Fix fetching of ringbuf's
map_fd to use light skeleton properly.

Fixes: 704e2beba23c ("selftests/bpf: Test ringbuf mmap read-only and read-write restrictions")
Fixes: 4d1b62986125 ("selftests/bpf: Convert few tests to light skeleton.")
