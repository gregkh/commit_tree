KVM: x86/mmu: Grab shadow root level from mmu_role for shadow MMUs

Use the mmu_role to initialize shadow root level instead of assuming the
level of KVM's shadow root (host) is the same as that of the guest root,
or in the case of 32-bit non-PAE paging where KVM forces PAE paging.
For nested NPT, the shadow root level cannot be adapted to L1's NPT root
level and is instead always the TDP root level because NPT uses the
current host CR0/CR4/EFER, e.g. 64-bit KVM can't drop into 32-bit PAE to
shadow L1's NPT.
