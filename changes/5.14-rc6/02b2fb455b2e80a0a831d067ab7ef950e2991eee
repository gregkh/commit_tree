kernel/module: Use BUG_ON instead of if condition followed by BUG

Fix the following coccinelle report:

kernel/module.c:1018:2-5:
WARNING: Use BUG_ON instead of if condition followed by BUG.

BUG_ON uses unlikely in if(). Through disassembly, we can see that
brk #0x800 is compiled to the end of the function.
As you can see below:
    ......
    ffffff8008660bec:   d65f03c0    ret
    ffffff8008660bf0:   d4210000    brk #0x800

Usually, the condition in if () is not satisfied. For the
multi-stage pipeline, we do not need to perform fetch decode
and excute operation on brk instruction.

In my opinion, this can improve the efficiency of the
multi-stage pipeline.
