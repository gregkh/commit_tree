KVM: x86: Fix sizes used to pass around CR0, CR4, and EFER

When configuring KVM's MMU, pass CR0 and CR4 as unsigned longs, and EFER
as a u64 in various flows (mostly MMU).  Passing the params as u32s is
functionally ok since all of the affected registers reserve bits 63:32 to
zero (enforced by KVM), but it's technically wrong.

No functional change intended.
