KVM: nVMX: Disable vmcs02 posted interrupts if vmcs12 PID isn't mappable

Don't allow posted interrupts to modify a stale posted interrupt
descriptor (including the initial value of 0).

Empirical tests on real hardware reveal that a posted interrupt
descriptor referencing an unbacked address has PCI bus error semantics
(reads as all 1's; writes are ignored). However, kvm can't distinguish
unbacked addresses from device-backed (MMIO) addresses, so it should
really ask userspace for an MMIO completion. That's overly
complicated, so just punt with KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR.

Don't return the error until the posted interrupt descriptor is
actually accessed. We don't want to break the existing kvm-unit-tests
that assume they can launch an L2 VM with a posted interrupt
descriptor that references MMIO space in L1.
