ALSA: firewire-lib: drop initial NODATA or empty packet

The devices based on BeBoB ASICs or the devices in Tascam FireWire
series transfer a batch of NODATA packet or empty packet in the beginning
of packet streaming. To avoid processing them, current implementation uses
an option to skip processing content of tx packet during some initial
cycles. However, the hard-coded number is not enough useful.

This commit drops content of packets till the packet includes any event
firstly. The function of option is to skip processing content of tx packet
with any event after dropping.
