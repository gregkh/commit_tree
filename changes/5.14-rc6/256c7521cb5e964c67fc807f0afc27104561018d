dt-bindings: reset: add IDs for SCMI reset domains on stm32mp15

stm32mp15 TZ secure firmware provides SCMI reset domains for
secure resources. This change defines the SCMI reset domain
identifiers used by SCMI agents and servers.

Stm32mp15 TZ secure firmware provides SCMI clocks for oscillators, some
PLL output and few secure aware interfaces. This change defines the
SCMI clock identifiers used by SCMI agents and servers.

Server SCMI0 exposes reset controllers for resources under RCC[TZEN]
configuration control.
