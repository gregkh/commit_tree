i40e: Fix logic of disabling queues

Correct the message flow between driver and firmware when disabling
queues.

Previously in case of PF reset (due to required reinit after reconfig),
the error like: "VSI seid 397 Tx ring 60 disable timeout" could show up
occasionally. The error was not a real issue of hardware or firmware,
it was caused by wrong sequence of messages invoked by the driver.
