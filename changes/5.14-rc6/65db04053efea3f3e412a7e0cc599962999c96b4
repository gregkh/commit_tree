PCI: Coalesce host bridge contiguous apertures

Built-in graphics on HP EliteDesk 805 G6 doesn't work because graphics
can't get the BAR it needs:

  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x10020200000-0x100303fffff window]
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x10030400000-0x100401fffff window]

  pci 0000:00:08.1:   bridge window [mem 0xd2000000-0xd23fffff]
  pci 0000:00:08.1:   bridge window [mem 0x10030000000-0x100401fffff 64bit pref]
  pci 0000:00:08.1: can't claim BAR 15 [mem 0x10030000000-0x100401fffff 64bit pref]: no compatible bridge window
  pci 0000:00:08.1: [mem 0x10030000000-0x100401fffff 64bit pref] clipped to [mem 0x10030000000-0x100303fffff 64bit pref]
  pci 0000:00:08.1:   bridge window [mem 0x10030000000-0x100303fffff 64bit pref]
  pci 0000:07:00.0: can't claim BAR 0 [mem 0x10030000000-0x1003fffffff 64bit pref]: no compatible bridge window
  pci 0000:07:00.0: can't claim BAR 2 [mem 0x10040000000-0x100401fffff 64bit pref]: no compatible bridge window

However, the root bus has two contiguous apertures that can contain the
child resource requested.

Coalesce contiguous apertures so we can allocate from the entire contiguous
region.
