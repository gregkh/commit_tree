ALSA: scarlett2: Correct channel mute status after mute button pressed

After the hardware mute button is pressed, private->vol_updated is set
so that the mute status is invalidated. As the channel mute values may
be affected by the global mute value, update scarlett2_mute_ctl_get()
to call scarlett2_update_volumes() if private->vol_updated is set.
