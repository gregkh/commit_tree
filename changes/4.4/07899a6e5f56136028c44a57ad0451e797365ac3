rcu_sync: Introduce rcu_sync_dtor()

This commit allows rcu_sync structures to be safely deallocated,
The trick is to add a new ->wait field to the gp_ops array.
This field is a pointer to the rcu_barrier() function corresponding
to the flavor of RCU in question.  This allows a new rcu_sync_dtor()
to wait for any outstanding callbacks before freeing the rcu_sync
structure.
