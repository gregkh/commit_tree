modpost: Add flag -E for making section mismatches fatal

The section mismatch warning can be easy to miss during the kernel build
process. Allow it to be marked as fatal to be easily caught and prevent
bugs from slipping in.

Setting CONFIG_SECTION_MISMATCH_WARN_ONLY=y causes these warnings to be
non-fatal, since there are a number of section mismatches when using
allmodconfig on some architectures, and we do not want to break these
builds by default.
