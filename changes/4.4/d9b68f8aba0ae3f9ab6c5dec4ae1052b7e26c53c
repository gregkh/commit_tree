i40e: Fix a port VLAN configuration bug

If a port VLAN is set for a given virtual function (VF) before the VF
driver is loaded then a configuration error results in which the port
VLAN is ignored when the VF driver is subsequently loaded.  This causes
the VF's MAC/VLAN filters to not use the correct VLAN filter.  This
patch ensures that the port VLAN filter is considered at the right time
during configuration of the VF's MAC/VLAN filters.
