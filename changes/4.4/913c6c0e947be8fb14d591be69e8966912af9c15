serial: imx: add earlycon support

Earlycon allows to have an early debugging console that doesn't need
to be statically configured in the kernel config, like earlyprintk,
but is set up through the stdout-path DT property.

This allows to have the early debugging always built into the
kernel and enabled on demand without clashing between different boards
or architectures.
