i2c: designware: Remove interrupt clearing from i2c_dw_pci_probe()

There is no need to clear interrupts in i2c_dw_pci_probe() since only place
where interrupts are unmasked is i2c_dw_xfer_init() and there interrupts
are always cleared after commit 2a2d95e9d6d2 ("i2c: designware: always
clear interrupts before enabling them").

This allows to cleanup the code and replace i2c_dw_clear_int() in
i2c_dw_xfer_init() by direct register read as there are no other callers.
