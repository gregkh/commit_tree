    drm/i915: skip modeset if compatible for everyone.

Bring back the i915.fastboot module parameter, disabled by default, due
to backlight regression on Chromebook Pixel 2015.

Apparently the firmware of the Chromebook in question enables the panel
but disables backlight to avoid a brief garbage scanout upon loading the
kernel/module. With fastboot, we leave the backlight untouched, in this
case disabled. The user would have to do a modeset (i.e. not just crank
up the brightness) to enable the backlight.

There is no clean fix readily available, so get back to the drawing
board by reverting.
