dmaengine: edma: Dynamic paRAM slot handling if HW supports it

If the eDMA3 has support for channel paRAM slot mapping we can utilize it
to allocate slots on demand and save precious slots for real transfers.
On am335x the eDMA has 64 channels which means we can unlock 64 paRAM
slots out from the available 256.
