ARM: tegra: paz00: use con_id's to refer GPIO's in gpiod_lookup table

Commit 72daceb9a10a ("net: rfkill: gpio: Add default GPIO driver mappings
for ACPI") removed possibility to request GPIO by table index for non-ACPI
platforms without changing its users. As result "shutdown" GPIO request
will fail if request for "reset" GPIO succeeded or "reset" will be
requested instead of "shutdown" if "reset" wasn't defined. Fix it by
making gpiod_lookup_table use con_id's instead of indexes.
