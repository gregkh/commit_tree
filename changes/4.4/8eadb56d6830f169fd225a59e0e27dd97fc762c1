serial: sh-sci: Don't kick tx in sci_er_interrupt() when using DMA

If CONFIG_SERIAL_SH_SCI_DMA is enabled, the driver doesn't enable TIE
on SCIF or HSCIF. However, this driver may call sci_tx_interrupt()
in sci_er_interrupt(). After that, the driver cannot care of the
interrupt, and then "irq 109: nobody cared" happens on r8a7791/koelsch
board. This patch fixes the issue.
