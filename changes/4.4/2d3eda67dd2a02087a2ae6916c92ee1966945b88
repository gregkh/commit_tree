regulator: tps65023: add device tree support

Add device tree based initialization support for tps65023 regulators.
Therefore add macros for regulator definition setting of_match and
regulators_node members. Add initialization of regulator_desc data
using these macros. Remove old regulator_desc initialization.

Add device tree binding document for tps65023 regulators.
