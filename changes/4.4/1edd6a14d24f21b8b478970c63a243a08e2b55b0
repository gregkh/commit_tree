RDS-TCP: Do not bloat sndbuf/rcvbuf in rds_tcp_tune

Using the value of RDS_TCP_DEFAULT_BUFSIZE (128K)
clobbers efficient use of TSO because it inflates the size_goal
that is computed in tcp_sendmsg/tcp_sendpage and skews packet
latency, and the default values for these parameters actually
results in significantly better performance.

In request-response tests using rds-stress with a packet size of
100K with 16 threads (test parameters -q 100000 -a 256 -t16 -d16)
between a single pair of IP addresses achieves a throughput of
6-8 Gbps. Without this patch, throughput maxes at 2-3 Gbps under
equivalent conditions on these platforms.
