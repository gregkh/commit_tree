coccinelle: misc: remove "complex return code" warnings

This effectively reverts 932058a5d5f9 ("coccinelle: misc: semantic patch
to delete overly complex return code processing").

There can be both symmetry and readability reasons for not wanting to do
the final function call as part of the return statement and to maintain
a clear separation of success and error paths.

Since this is in no way mandated by the coding standard, let's just
remove this semantic patch to avoid having "clean up" patches being
posted over and over in response to these Coccinelle warnings.
