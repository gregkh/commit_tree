KVM: x86: add pcommit support

Pass PCOMMIT CPU feature to guest to enable PCOMMIT instruction

Currently we do not catch pcommit instruction for L1 guest and
allow L1 to catch this instruction for L2 if, as required by the spec,
L1 can enumerate the PCOMMIT instruction via CPUID:
| IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2[53] (which enumerates support for the
| 1-setting of PCOMMIT exiting) is always the same as
| CPUID.07H:EBX.PCOMMIT[bit 22]. Thus, software can set PCOMMIT exiting
| to 1 if and only if the PCOMMIT instruction is enumerated via CPUID

The spec can be found at
