ALSA: firewire-digi00x: add support for MIDI ports for physical controls

In former commits, asynchronous transactions are supported for physical
controls. This commit adds a pair of MIDI ports for them.

This driver already adds diferrent number of ALSA MIDI ports for physical
MIDI ports, and the number of in/out ports are different. As seeing as
'amidi' program in alsa-utils package, a pair of in/out MIDI ports is
expected with the same name. Therefore, this commit adds a pair of new
ports to the first.
