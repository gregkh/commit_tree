PM / sleep: Drop pm_request_idle() from pm_generic_complete()

The pm_request_idle() in pm_generic_complete() is pointless as it is
called with the runtime PM usage counter different from zero (bumped
up by the core during the prepare phase of system suspend) and the
core calls pm_runtime_put() for all devices after executing their
complete callbacks, so drop it.

This allows the PCI PM layer to use pm_generic_complete() too.
