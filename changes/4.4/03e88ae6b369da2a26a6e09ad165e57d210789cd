tracing: Remove unused ftrace_cpu_disabled per cpu variable

Since the ring buffer is lockless, there is no need to disable ftrace on
CPU. And no one doing so: after commit 68179686ac67cb ("tracing: Remove
ftrace_disable/enable_cpu()") ftrace_cpu_disabled stays the same after
initialization, nothing changes it.
ftrace_cpu_disabled shouldn't be used by any external module since it
disables only function and graph_function tracers but not any other
tracer.
