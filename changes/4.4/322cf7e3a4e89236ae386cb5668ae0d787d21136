enic: assign affinity hint to interrupts

The affinity hint is used by the user space daemon, irqbalancer, to
indicate a preferred CPU mask for irqs. This patch sets the irq affinity
hint to local numa core first, when exausted we try non-local numa cores.

Also set tx xps cpus mask bassed on affinity hint.

v2: remove the global affinity policy.
