MIPS: vmlinux: create a section for appended DTB

For bootloaders that support booting only ELF kernels and load only ELF
segments to memory there is no easy way to supply DTB without kernel
recompilation. For that purpose, create a section called .appended_dtb
that can be later updated with board-specific DTB using binutils e.g. at
kernel installation time.
