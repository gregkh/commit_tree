nilfs2: use nilfs_warning() in allocator implementation

This uses nilfs_warning() to replace "printk(KERN_WARNING ...);" in the
bitmap based allocator implementation of nilfs2.  The warning messages are
modified to include the device name and the inode number in each message.
This makes it clear which metadata file of which device has output
warnings such as "entry number xxxx already freed".
