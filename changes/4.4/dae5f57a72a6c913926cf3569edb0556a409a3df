vfs: Fix the posix_acl_xattr_list return value

When a filesystem that contains POSIX ACLs is mounted without ACL support
(-o noacl), the appropriate behavior is not to list any existing POSIX ACL
xattrs.  The return value for list xattr handlers in this case is 0, not an
error code: several filesystems that use the POSIX ACL xattr handlers do
not expect the list operation to fail.

Symlinks cannot have ACLs, so posix_acl_xattr_list will never be called for
symlinks in the first place.
