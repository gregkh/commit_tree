mm: hugetlb: fix hugepage memory leak caused by wrong reserve count

When dequeue_huge_page_vma() in alloc_huge_page() fails, we fall back on
alloc_buddy_huge_page() to directly create a hugepage from the buddy
allocator.

In that case, however, if alloc_buddy_huge_page() succeeds we don't
decrement h->resv_huge_pages, which means that successful
hugetlb_fault() returns without releasing the reserve count.  As a
result, subsequent hugetlb_fault() might fail despite that there are
still free hugepages.

This patch simply adds decrementing code on that code path.

I reproduced this problem when testing v4.3 kernel in the following situation:
 - the test machine/VM is a NUMA system,
 - hugepage overcommiting is enabled,
 - most of hugepages are allocated and there's only one free hugepage
   which is on node 0 (for example),
 - another program, which calls set_mempolicy(MPOL_BIND) to bind itself to
   node 1, tries to allocate a hugepage,
 - the allocation should fail but the reserve count is still hold.
