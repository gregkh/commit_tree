sched/fair: Have task_move_group_fair() unconditionally add the entity load to the runqueue

Currently we conditionally add the entity load to the rq when moving
the task between cgroups.

This doesn't make sense as we always 'migrate' the task between
cgroups, so we should always migrate the load too.

[ The history here is that we used to only migrate the blocked load
  which was only meaningfull when !queued. ]
