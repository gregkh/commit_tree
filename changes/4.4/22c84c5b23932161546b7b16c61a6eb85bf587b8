NFC: st-nci: Keep st_nci_gates unchanged in load_session

We need to keep initial st_nci_gates values in order for
nci_hci_dev_connect_gates to create and open pipe when necessary.

For example after a firmware update CLF pipes are cleared. Changing
pipe values in st_nci_gates was causing nci_hci_dev_connect_gates
not using accurate pipes value.
