arm64: fix R/O permissions of FDT mapping

The mapping permissions of the FDT are set to 'PAGE_KERNEL | PTE_RDONLY'
in an attempt to map the FDT as read-only. However, not only does this
break at build time under STRICT_MM_TYPECHECKS (since the two terms are
of different types in that case), it also results in both the PTE_WRITE
and PTE_RDONLY attributes to be set, which means the region is still
writable under ARMv8.1 DBM (and an attempted write will simply clear the
PT_RDONLY bit).

So instead, define PAGE_KERNEL_RO (which already has an established
meaning across architectures) and use that instead.
