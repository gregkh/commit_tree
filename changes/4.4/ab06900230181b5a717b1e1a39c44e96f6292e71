net: switchdev: abstract object in add/del ops

Similar to the notifier_call callback of a notifier_block, change the
function signature of switchdev add and del operations to:

    int switchdev_port_obj_add/del(struct net_device *dev,
                                   enum switchdev_obj_id id, void *obj);

This allows the caller to pass a specific switchdev_obj_* structure
instead of the generic switchdev_obj one.

Drivers implementation of these operations and switchdev have been
changed accordingly.
