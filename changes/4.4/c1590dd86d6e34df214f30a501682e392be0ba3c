mmc: sunxi: Add card busy detection

Some sdio wifi modules have not been working reliable with the sunxi-mmc
host code. This turns out to be caused by starting new io-rw commands while
the card signals that it is still busy processing a previous command.

This commit adds card-busy detection to the sunxi-mmc driver which together
with recent core changes to check card-busy before starting io-rw commands
fixes the wifi reliability issues on the Cubietruck and other sunxi boards
using sdio wifi.
