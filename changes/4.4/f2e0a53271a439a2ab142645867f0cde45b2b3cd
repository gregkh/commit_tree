clk: Add a basic multiplier clock

Some clocks are using a multiplier component, however, unlike their mux,
gate or divider counterpart, these factors don't have a basic clock
implementation.

This leads to code duplication across platforms that want to use that kind
of clocks, and the impossibility to use the composite clocks with such a
clock without defining your own rate operations.

Create such a driver in order to remove these issues, and hopefully factor
the implementations, reducing code size across platforms and consolidating
the various implementations.
