perf probe: Export init/exit_probe_symbol_maps()

The init/exit_symbols_maps() functions are to setup and cleanup
necessary info for probe events.  But they need to be called from out of
the probe code now, so this patch exports them.

However the names are too generic, so change them to have 'probe'. :)
