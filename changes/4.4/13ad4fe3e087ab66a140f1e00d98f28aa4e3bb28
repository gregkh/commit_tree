xfs: xfs_filemap_pmd_fault treats read faults as write faults

The code initially committed didn't have the same checks for write
faults as the dax_pmd_fault code and hence treats all faults as
write faults. We can get read faults through this path because they
is no pmd_mkwrite path for write faults similar to the normal page
fault path. Hence we need to ensure that we only do c/mtime updates
on write faults, and freeze protection is unnecessary for read
faults.
