iommu: Implement common IOMMU ops for DMA mapping

Taking inspiration from the existing arch/arm code, break out some
generic functions to interface the DMA-API to the IOMMU-API. This will
do the bulk of the heavy lifting for IOMMU-backed dma-mapping.

Since associating an IOVA allocator with an IOMMU domain is a fairly
common need, rather than introduce yet another private structure just to
do this for ourselves, extend the top-level struct iommu_domain with the
notion. A simple opaque cookie allows reuse by other IOMMU API users
with their various different incompatible allocator types.
