xen: Resume PMU from non-atomic context

Resuming PMU currently triggers a warning from ___might_sleep() (assuming
CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP is set) when xen_pmu_init() allocates GFP_KERNEL
page because we are in state resembling atomic context.

Move resuming PMU to xen_arch_resume() which is called in regular context.
For symmetry move suspending PMU to xen_arch_suspend() as well.
