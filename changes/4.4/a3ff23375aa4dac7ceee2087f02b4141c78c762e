clk: atlas7: fix noc/socket disconnect/reconnect for unit clks

Power management on of NoC(Notwork On Chip) requires that disconnect
and reconnect routine should been done during clk disable/enable.

also there are different types of clocks,
For NoC Macro clocks, write idle_bit and wait for hardward ACK;
For Socket clocks, write idle_bit;
For others, do nothing.
