dm: fix ioctl retry termination with signal

dm-mpath retries ioctl, when no path is readily available and the device
is configured to queue I/O in such a case. If you want to stop the retry
before multipathd decides to turn off queueing mode, you could send
signal for the process to exit from the loop.

However the check of fatal signal has not carried along when commit
6c182cd88d17 ("dm mpath: fix ioctl deadlock when no paths") moved the
loop from dm-mpath to dm core. As a result, we can't terminate such
a process in the retry loop.

Easy reproducer of the situation is:

  # dmsetup create mp --table '0 1024 multipath 0 0 0 0'
  # dmsetup message mp 0 'queue_if_no_path'
  # sg_inq /dev/mapper/mp

then you should be able to terminate sg_inq by pressing Ctrl+C.
