pwm: Return -ENODEV if no PWM lookup match is found

When looking up a PWM using the lookup table, assume that all entries
will have been added already, so failure to find a match means that no
corresponding entry has been registered.

This fixes an issue where -EPROBE_DEFER would be returned if the PWM
lookup table is empty. After this fix, -EPROBE_DEFER is reserved for
situations where no provider has yet registered for a matching entry.
