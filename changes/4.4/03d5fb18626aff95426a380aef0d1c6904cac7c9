net: switchdev: remove dev from switchdev_obj cb

The net_device associated to a dump operation does not have to be passed
to the callback. switchdev stores it in a superset struct, if needed.

Also some drivers (such as DSA drivers) may not have easy access to it.

This will simplify pushing the callback function down to the drivers.
