PCI: layerscape: Factor out SCFG related function

For the LS1021a PCIe controller, some status registers are located in SCFG,
unlike other Layerscape devices.

Move SCFG-related code to ls1021_pcie_host_init() and rename
ls_pcie_link_up() to ls1021_pcie_link_up() because LTSSM status is also in
SCFG.
