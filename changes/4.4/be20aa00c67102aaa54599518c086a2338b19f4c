nfsd: don't hold ls_mutex across a layout recall

We do need to serialize layout stateid morphing operations, but we
currently hold the ls_mutex across a layout recall which is pretty
ugly. It's also unnecessary -- once we've bumped the seqid and
copied it, we don't need to serialize the rest of the CB_LAYOUTRECALL
vs. anything else. Just drop the mutex once the copy is done.

This was causing a "workqueue leaked lock or atomic" warning and an
occasional deadlock.

There's more work to be done here but this fixes the immediate
regression.
