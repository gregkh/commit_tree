net: smsc911x: Fix crash if loopback test fails

On certain hardware in certain situations loopback test fails and the
driver gets removed. During mdiobus_unregister() instance of PHY driver
gets disposed. But by this time it has already been started using
phy_connect_direct().

PHY driver uses DELAYED_WORK in order to maintain its state. Attempting
to dispose the driver without calling phy_disconnect() causes deallocation
of DELAYED_WORK being active. This shortly causes a bad crash in timer
code.

The problem can be discovered by enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_TIMERS and
CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_FREE
