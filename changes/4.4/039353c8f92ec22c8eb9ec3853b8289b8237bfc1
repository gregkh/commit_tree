mtd: nand: vf610_nfc: include missing pincrl/consumer.h

This must have been implicitly included on the builds I tested. Reported
by numerous test bots:

   drivers/mtd/nand/vf610_nfc.c: In function 'vf610_nfc_resume':
   drivers/mtd/nand/vf610_nfc.c:660:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'pinctrl_pm_select_default_state' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
     pinctrl_pm_select_default_state(dev);
