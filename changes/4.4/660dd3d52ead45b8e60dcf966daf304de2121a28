ALSA: firewire-digi00x: add hwdep interface

This commit adds hwdep interface so as the other sound drivers for units
on IEEE 1394 bus have.

This interface is designed for mixer/control applications. By using this
interface, an application can get information about firewire node, can
lock/unlock kernel streaming and can get notification at starting/stopping
kernel streaming.
