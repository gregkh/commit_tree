cancel the setfilesize transation when io error happen

When I ran xfstest/073 case, the remount process was blocked to wait
transactions to be zero. I found there was a io error happened, and
the setfilesize transaction was not released properly. We should add
the changes to cancel the io error in this case.

Reproduction steps:
1. dd if=/dev/zero of=xfs1.img bs=1M count=2048
2. mkfs.xfs xfs1.img
3. losetup -f ./xfs1.img /dev/loop0
4. mount -t xfs /dev/loop0 /home/test_dir/
5. mkdir /home/test_dir/test
6. mkfs.xfs -dfile,name=image,size=2g
7. mount -t xfs -o loop image /home/test_dir/test
8. cp a file bigger than 2g to /home/test_dir/test
9. mount -t xfs -o remount,ro /home/test_dir/test

[ dchinner: moved io error detection to xfs_setfilesize_ioend() after
  transaction context restoration. ]
