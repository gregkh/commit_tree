Input: elants_i2c - fix wake-on-touch

When sending "SLEEP" command to the controller it ceases scanning
completely and is unable to wake the system up from sleep, so if it is
configured as a wakeup source we should simply configure interrupt for
wakeup and rely on idle logic within the controller to reduce power
consumption while it is not used.
