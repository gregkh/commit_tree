x86/signal: Fix restart_syscall number for x32 tasks

When restarting a syscall with regs->ax == -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK,
regs->ax is assigned to a restart_syscall number.  For x32 tasks, this
syscall number must have __X32_SYSCALL_BIT set, otherwise it will be
an x86_64 syscall number instead of a valid x32 syscall number. This
issue has been there since the introduction of x32.
