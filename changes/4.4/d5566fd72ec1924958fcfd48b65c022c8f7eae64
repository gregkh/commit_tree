rtnetlink: RTEXT_FILTER_SKIP_STATS support to avoid dumping inet/inet6 stats

Many commonly used functions like getifaddrs() invoke RTM_GETLINK
to dump the interface information, and do not need the
the AF_INET6 statististics that are always returned by default
from rtnl_fill_ifinfo().

Computing the statistics can be an expensive operation that impacts
scaling, so it is desirable to avoid this if the information is
not needed.

This patch adds a the RTEXT_FILTER_SKIP_STATS extended info flag that
can be passed with netlink_request() to avoid statistics computation
for the ifinfo path.
