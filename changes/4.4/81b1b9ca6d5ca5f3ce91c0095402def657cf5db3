KVM: VMX: Fix host initiated access to guest MSR_TSC_AUX

The current handling of accesses to guest MSR_TSC_AUX returns error if
vcpu does not support rdtscp, though those accesses are initiated by
host. This can result in the reboot failure of some versions of
QEMU. This patch fixes this issue by passing those host initiated
accesses for further handling instead.
