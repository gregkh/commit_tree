misc: mic: SCIF poll

SCIF poll allows both user and kernel mode clients to wait on
events on a SCIF endpoint. These events include availability of
space or data in the SCIF ring buffer, availability of connection
requests on a listening endpoint and completion of connections
when using async connects.
