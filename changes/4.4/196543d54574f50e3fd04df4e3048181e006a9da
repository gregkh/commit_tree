ALSA: hda - Apply HP headphone fixups more generically

It turned out that many HP laptops suffer from the same problem as
fixed in commit [c932b98c1e47: ALSA: hda - Apply pin fixup for HP
ProBook 6550b].  But, it's tiresome to list up all such PCI SSIDs, as
there are really lots of HP machines.

Instead, we do a bit more clever, try to check the supposedly dock and
built-in headphone pins, and apply the fixup when both seem valid.
This rule can be applied generically to all models using the same
quirk, so we'll fix all in a shot.
