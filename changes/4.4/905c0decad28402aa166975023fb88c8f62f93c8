serial: imx: don't use idle condition detect for DMA transfers

The reference manual states that idle condition detect should not be used
with DMA transfers, as the ROM SDMA scripts don't check those conditions.

The RAM SDMA scripts worked around this, but the change broke compatibility
with the ROM scripts.

The previous commits fixed the DMA burst sizes, so that the aging timer is
now working as described in the reference manual. With this fixed we can
remove the hack of using the idle condition detect to stop the DMA transfer
if there are no new characters incoming.

This should work with both the ROM and RAM SDMA scripts.
