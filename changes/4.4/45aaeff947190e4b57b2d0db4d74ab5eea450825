mtd: nand: pass page number to ecc->write_xxx() methods

The ->read_xxx() methods are all passed the page number the NAND controller
is supposed to read, but ->write_xxx() do not have such a parameter.

This is a problem if we want to properly implement data
scrambling/randomization in order to mitigate MLC sensibility to repeated
pattern: to prevent bitflips in adjacent pages in the same block we need
to avoid repeating the same pattern at the same offset in those pages,
hence the randomizer/scrambler engine need to be passed the page value
in order to adapt its seed accordingly.

Moreover, adding the page parameter to the ->write_xxx() methods add some
consistency to the current API.
