cgroup: reorganize css_task_iter functions

* Rename css_advance_task_iter() to css_task_iter_advance_css_set()
  and make it clear it->task_pos too at the end of the iteration.

* Factor out css_task_iter_advance() from css_task_iter_next().  The
  new function whines if called on a terminated iterator.

Except for the termination check, this is pure reorganization and
doesn't introduce any behavior changes.  This will help the planned
locking update for css_task_iter.
