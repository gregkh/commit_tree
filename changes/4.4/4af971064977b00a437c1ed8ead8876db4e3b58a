PCI: of: Add 64-bit address recognition without LPAE support

If non-LPAE kernel is booted up on a machine with 64-bit PCI resources,
PCI controller probe fails with:

PCI host bridge /pcie@10000000 ranges:
   IO 0x3eff0000..0x3effffff -> 0x00000000
  MEM 0x10000000..0x3efeffff -> 0x10000000
  MEM 0x8000000000..0xffffffffff -> 0x8000000000
pci-host-generic 3f000000.pcie: resource collision: [mem 0x00000000-0xffffffff] conflicts with /pl011@9000000 [mem 0x09000000-0x09000fff]
pci-host-generic: probe of 3f000000.pcie failed with error -16

This happens because res->start assignment in of_pci_range_to_resource()
truncates the upper part of the address, because res->start is of
phys_addr_t type, which is 32-bit on non-LPAE kernels.

This patch adds explicit recognition of 64-bit resources, preventing from
potential problems when e. g. 0x8000001234 would be converted to
0x00001234.
