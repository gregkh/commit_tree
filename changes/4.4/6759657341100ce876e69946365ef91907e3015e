MIPS: Allow 24Hz timer frequency

A boundary exists beyond which the timer frequency becomes high enough
that timer interrupts saturate the system and either cause it to slow to
a crawl or stop functioning entirely. Where that boundary lies depends
upon a number of factors such as the overhead of each interrupt and the
overall speed of the CPU, but correlates strongly with the clock
frequency at which the CPU runs. When running on emulators during
bringup or debug of a CPU that clock frequency is very low, which
results in the boundary at which the timer frequency becomes
unsustainable being very low. The current minimum of 48Hz pushes against
boundary in certain situations in current systems. Allow the kernel to
be configured for a 24Hz timer frequency in order to avoid problems on
such slow running systems.
