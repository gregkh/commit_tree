staging/lustre: avoid unnecessary timeval conversion

The lnet_eq_wait_locked tries to wait for time to pass or an event to
wake up the wait queue. The entire logic seems to be a very elaborate
reimplementation of wait_event().

I'm not trying to clean up the entire logic here, but this at least
gets rid of the multi-way conversion between miliseconds, timeval
and jiffies.
