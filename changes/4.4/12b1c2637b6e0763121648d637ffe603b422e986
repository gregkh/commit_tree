Btrfs: enhance btrfs_scratch_superblock to scratch all superblocks

This patch updates and renames btrfs_scratch_superblocks, (which is used
by the replace device thread), with those fixes from the scratch
superblock code section of btrfs_rm_device(). The fixes are:
  Scratch all copies of superblock
  Notify kobject that superblock has been changed
  Update time on the device

So that btrfs_rm_device() can use the function
btrfs_scratch_superblocks() instead of its own scratch code. And further
replace deivce code which similarly releases device back to the system,
will have the fixes from the btrfs device delete.
