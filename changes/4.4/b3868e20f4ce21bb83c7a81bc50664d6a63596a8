n_tty: Remove reader wakeups for TTY_BREAK/TTY_PARITY chars

Waking the reader immediately upon receipt of TTY_BREAK or TTY_PARITY
chars has no effect on the outcome of read():
1. Only non-canonical/EXTPROC mode applies since canonical mode
   will not return data until a line termination is received anyway
2. EXTPROC mode - the reader will always be woken by the input worker
3. Non-canonical modes
   a. MIN == 0, TIME == 0
   b. MIN == 0, TIME > 0
   c. MIN > 0, TIME > 0
      minimum_to_wake is always 1 in these modes so the reader will always
      be woken by the input worker
   d. MIN > 0, TIME == 0
      although the reader will not be woken by the input worker unless the
      minimum data is received, the reader would not otherwise have
      returned the received data
