ALSA: hda - Simplify phantom jack handling for HDMI/DP

The HDMI codec parser may create a phantom jack, but the helper
function snd_hda_jack_add_kctl() treats always as a normal jack.  This
is superfluous as the jack query is executed at each time the jack
sync is performed.

Since the HDMI codec parser is the only caller of this function, it's
easier to change back this directly calling the original
__snd_hda_jack_add_kctl() with phantom_jack parameter.
