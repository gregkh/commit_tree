serial: mctrl-gpio: rename init function

This is done before adding more functionality to the init function with
the existing name. As this new functionality conflicts with stuff
drivers are required to implement themselves up to I want to convert
them one by one to make reviewing and reverting more easy in case I
broke something.

Once mctrl_gpio_init is there and all drivers are converted
mctrl_gpio_init_noauto can be removed again.
