staging: wilc1000: fix the bug on copying bssid

This patch reverts the commit, d79fd35b8c5d927695b48fa35aa586919818cce9.

The WID_JOIN_REQ_EXTENDED among WIDs needs two parameters for the request to
be sent to the firmware, which are the SA and the BSSID. For this case, both
is the same bssid in the handle_connect function. So, it's required to be
copied twice.
