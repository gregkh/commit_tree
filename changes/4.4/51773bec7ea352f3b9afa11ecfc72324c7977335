btrfs: qgroup: Avoid calling btrfs_free_reserved_data_space in clear_bit_hook

In clear_bit_hook, qgroup reserved data is already handled quite well,
either released by finish_ordered_io or invalidatepage.

So calling btrfs_qgroup_free_data() here is completely meaningless, and
since btrfs_qgroup_free_data() will lock io_tree, so it can't be called
with io_tree lock hold.

This patch will add a new function
btrfs_free_reserved_data_space_noquota() for clear_bit_hook() to cease
the lockdep warning.
