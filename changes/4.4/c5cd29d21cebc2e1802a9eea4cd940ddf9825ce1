f2fs: no need to lock for update_inode_page all the time

As comment says, we don't need to call f2fs_lock_op in write_inode to prevent
from producing dirty node pages all the time.
That happens only when there is not enough free sections and we can avoid that
by calling balance_fs in prior to that.
