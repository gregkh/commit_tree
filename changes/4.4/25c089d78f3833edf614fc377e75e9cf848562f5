qed: Add basic L2 interface

This patch adds a public API for a network driver to work on top of QED.
The interface itself is very minimal - it's mostly infrastructure, as the
only content it has after this patch is a query for HW-based information
required for the creation of a network interface [I.e., no actual
protocol-specific configurations are supported].
