rbd: don't put snap_context twice in rbd_queue_workfn()

Commit 4e752f0ab0e8 ("rbd: access snapshot context and mapping size
safely") moved ceph_get_snap_context() out of rbd_img_request_create()
and into rbd_queue_workfn(), adding a ceph_put_snap_context() to the
error path in rbd_queue_workfn().  However, rbd_img_request_create()
consumes a ref on snapc, so calling ceph_put_snap_context() after
a successful rbd_img_request_create() leads to an extra put.  Fix it.
