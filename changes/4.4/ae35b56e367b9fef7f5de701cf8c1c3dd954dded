drm/i915: Unbreak check_digital_port_conflicts()

Atomic changes broke check_digital_port_conflicts(). It needs to look
at the global situation instead of just trying to find a conflict
within the current atomic state.

This bug made my HSW explode spectacularly after I had split the DDI
encoders into separate DP and HDMI encoders. With the fix, things
seem much more solid.

I hope holding the connection_mutex is enough protection that we can
actually walk the connectors even if they're not part of the current
atomic state...

v2: Regenerate the patch so that it actually applies (Jani)
