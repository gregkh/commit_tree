drm/i915: fix the FBC work allocation failure path

Always update the currrent crtc, fb and vertical offset after calling
enable_fbc. We were forgetting to do so along the failure paths when
enabling fbc synchronously. Fix this with a new helper to enable_fbc()
and update the state simultaneously.

v2: Improve commit message (Chris).
v3: Constify struct drm_framebuffer (Ville).
