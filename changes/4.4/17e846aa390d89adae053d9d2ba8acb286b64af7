ARM: dts: keystone: k2l: fix kernel crash when clk_ignore_unused is not in bootargs

Currently kernel crash randomly when K2L EVM is booted without
clk_ignore_unused in the bootargs. This workaround is not needed
on other K2 devices such as K2HK and K2E and with this fix, we can
remove the workaround altogether. netcp driver on K2L uses linked
ram on OSR (On chip Static RAM) and requires the clock to this peripheral
enabled for proper functioning. This is the reason for the kernel crash.
So add the clock node to fix this issue.

While at it, remove the workaround documentation as well.

With the fix applied, clk_summary dump shows the clock to OSR enabled.
