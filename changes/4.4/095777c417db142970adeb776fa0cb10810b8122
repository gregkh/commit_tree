locktorture: Support rtmutex torturing

Real time mutexes is one of the few general primitives
that we do not have in locktorture. Address this -- a few
considerations:

o To spice things up, enable competing thread(s) to become
rt, such that we can stress different prio boosting paths
in the rtmutex code. Introduce a ->task_boost callback,
only used by rtmutex-torturer. Tasks will boost/deboost
around every 50k (arbitrarily) lock/unlock operations.

o Hold times are similar to what we have for other locks:
only occasionally having longer hold times (per ~200k ops).
So we roughly do two full rt boost+deboosting ops with
short hold times.
