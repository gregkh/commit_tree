drm/i915/bxt: don't allow cached GEM mappings on A stepping

Due to a coherency issue on BXT A steppings we can't guarantee a
coherent view of cached (CPU snooped) GPU mappings, so fail such
requests. User space is supposed to fall back to uncached mappings in
this case.

v2:
- limit the WA to A steppings, on later stepping this HW issue is fixed
v3:
- return error instead of trying to work around the issue in kernel,
  since that could confuse user space (Chris)
