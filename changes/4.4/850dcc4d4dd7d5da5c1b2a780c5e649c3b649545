ipv4: Fix ip_queue_xmit to pass sk into ip_local_out_sk

After a packet has been encapsulated by a tunnel we should use the
tunnel sockets local multicast loopback flag to control if the
encapsulated packet should be locally loopback back.

Pass sk into ip_local_out_sk so that in the rare case we are dealing
with a tunneled packet whose tunnel destination address is a multicast
address the kernel properly decides to loopback this packet.

In practice I don't think this matters as ip_queue_xmit is used by
tcp, l2tp and sctp none of which I am aware of uses ip level
multicasting as they are all point to point communications protocols.
Let's fix this before someone uses ip_queue_xmit for a tunnel protocol
that does use multicast.
