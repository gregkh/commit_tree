RDS: fix race condition when sending a message on unbound socket

Sasha's found a NULL pointer dereference in the RDS connection code when
sending a message to an apparently unbound socket.  The problem is caused
by the code checking if the socket is bound in rds_sendmsg(), which checks
the rs_bound_addr field without taking a lock on the socket.  This opens a
race where rs_bound_addr is temporarily set but where the transport is not
in rds_bind(), leading to a NULL pointer dereference when trying to
dereference 'trans' in __rds_conn_create().

Vegard wrote a reproducer for this issue, so kindly ask him to share if
you're interested.

I cannot reproduce the NULL pointer dereference using Vegard's reproducer
with this patch, whereas I could without.

Complete earlier incomplete fix to CVE-2015-6937:

  74e98eb08588 ("RDS: verify the underlying transport exists before creating a connection")
