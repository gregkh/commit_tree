tracing: Remove access to trace_flags in trace_printk.c

In the effort to move the global trace_flags to the tracing instances, the
direct access to trace_flags must be removed from trace_printk.c

Instead, add a new trace_printk_enabled boolean that is set by a new access
function trace_printk_control(), that will enable or disable trace_printk.
