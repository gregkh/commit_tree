staging: comedi: dt3000: rename dual-ported RAM location defines

Rename these CamelCase defines and fix the checkpatch.pl issues:

CHECK: Avoid CamelCase: <DPR_{various}>
CHECK: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
CHECK: spaces preferred around that '+' (ctx:VxV)

For aesthetics, move the defines to after the includes.
