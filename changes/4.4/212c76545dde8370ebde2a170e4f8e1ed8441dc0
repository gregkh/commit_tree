KVM: arm/arm64: Clean up vgic_retire_lr() and surroundings

1. Remove unnecessary 'irq' argument, because irq number can be retrieved
   from the LR.
2. Since cff9211eb1a1f58ce7f5a2d596b617928fd4be0e
   ("arm/arm64: KVM: Fix arch timer behavior for disabled interrupts ")
   LR_STATE_PENDING is queued back by vgic_retire_lr() itself. Also, it
   clears vlr.state itself. Therefore, we remove the same, now duplicated,
   check with all accompanying bit manipulations from vgic_unqueue_irqs().
3. vgic_retire_lr() is always accompanied by vgic_irq_clear_queued(). Since
   it already does more than just clearing the LR, move
   vgic_irq_clear_queued() inside of it.
