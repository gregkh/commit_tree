i2c: designware: Fix build error when !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP

Commit ("i2c: designware: Rename platform driver probe and PM
functions") introduced "'dw_i2c_plat_prepare' undeclared here" and
"'dw_i2c_plat_complete' undeclared here" build errors when
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not set.

Fix this by renaming NULL defined dw_i2c_prepare and dw_i2c_complete PM
hooks to dw_i2c_plat_prepare and dw_i2c_plat_complete since this was
obviously missing from the commit.
