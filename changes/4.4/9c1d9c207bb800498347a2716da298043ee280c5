sd: Reject optimal transfer length smaller than page size

Eryu Guan reported that loading scsi_debug would fail. This turned out
to be caused by scsi_debug reporting an optimal I/O size of 32KB which
is smaller than the 64KB page size on the PowerPC system in question.

Add a check to ensure that we only use the device-reported OPTIMAL
TRANSFER LENGTH if it is bigger than or equal to the page cache size.
