i40e: allow FD SB if MFP mode only has 1 partition

Even though the device might be in MFP mode, if there's only one partition
enabled, then we still have plenty of interrupts for managing the Flow
Directory Sideband activity.  This patch enables FD SB in this case.
This patch also reverses the sense of the conditional in order to remove
the negative logic.
