signal: turn dequeue_signal_lock() into kernel_dequeue_signal()

1. Rename dequeue_signal_lock() to kernel_dequeue_signal(). This
   matches another "for kthreads only" kernel_sigaction() helper.

2. Remove the "tsk" and "mask" arguments, they are always current
   and current->blocked. And it is simply wrong if tsk != current.

3. We could also remove the 3rd "siginfo_t *info" arg but it looks
   potentially useful. However we can simplify the callers if we
   change kernel_dequeue_signal() to accept info => NULL.

4. Remove _irqsave, it is never called from atomic context.
