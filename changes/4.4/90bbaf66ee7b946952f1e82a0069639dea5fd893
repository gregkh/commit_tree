ALSA: timer: add config item to export PCM timer disabling for expert

PCM timer is not always used. For embedded device, we need an interface
to disable it when it is not needed, to shrink the kernel size and
memory footprint, here add CONFIG_SND_PCM_TIMER for it.

When both CONFIG_SND_PCM_TIMER and CONFIG_SND_TIMER is unselected,
about 25KB saving bonus we can get.

Please be noted that when disabled, those stubs who using pcm timer
(e.g. dmix, dsnoop & co) may work incorrectlly.
