ocfs2: fix SGID not inherited issue

Commit 8f1eb48758aa ("ocfs2: fix umask ignored issue") introduced an
issue, SGID of sub dir was not inherited from its parents dir.  It is
because SGID is set into "inode->i_mode" in ocfs2_get_init_inode(), but
is overwritten by "mode" which don't have SGID set later.
