tools include: Fix strict-aliasing rules breakage

Vinson reported build breakage with gcc 4.4 due to strict-aliasing.

   CC       util/annotate.o
 cc1: warnings being treated as errors
 util/annotate.c: In function ‘disasm__purge’:
 linux-next/tools/include/linux/compiler.h:66: error: dereferencing
 pointer ‘res.41’ does break strict-aliasing rules

The reason is READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE code we took from kernel sources.  They
intentionaly break aliasing rules. While this is ok for kernel because it's
built with -fno-strict-aliasing, it breaks perf which is build with
-Wstrict-aliasing=3.

Using extra __may_alias__ type to allow aliasing in this case.
