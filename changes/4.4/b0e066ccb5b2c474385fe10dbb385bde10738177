serial: tegra: Remove redundant code and check in tegra_uart_stop_rx()

The serial-tegra driver always uses DMA and hence the driver always
allocates DMA channels. Therefore, the test to see if the RX DMA channel
is initialised in tegra_uart_stop_rx() is unnecessary and so remove
the test and the code that corresponds to the case where the RX DMA
channel is not initialised. Please note that the call to
tegra_uart_stop_rx() should always be before the call to
tegra_uart_shutdown() which will uninitialise the RX DMA channel.
