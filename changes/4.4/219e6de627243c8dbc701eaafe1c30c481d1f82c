staging/lustre: use 64-bit times for request times

All request timestamps and deadlines in lustre are recorded in time_t
and timeval units, which overflow in 2038 on 32-bit systems.

In this patch, I'm converting them to time64_t and timespec64,
respectively. Unfortunately, this makes a relatively large patch,
but I could not find an obvious way to split it up some more without
breaking atomicity of the change.

Also unfortunately, this introduces two instances of div_u64_rem()
in the request path, which can be slow on 32-bit architectures. This
can probably be avoided by a larger restructuring of the code, but
it is unlikely that lustre is used in performance critical setups
on 32-bit architectures, so it seems better to optimize for correctness
rather than speed here.
