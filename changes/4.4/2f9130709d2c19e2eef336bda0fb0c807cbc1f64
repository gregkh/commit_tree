net: bcmgenet: Implement TX coalescing control knobs

Configuring the ethtool tx-frames property, which translates into N
packets before a TX interrupt is the simplest configuration scheme
because it requires no locking neither at the softare nor hardware
level, and is completely indepedent from the link speed. Since ethtool
does not allow per-tx queue coalescing parameters, we apply the same
setting to any transmit queue.

We can no longer enable the BDONE/PDONE interrupts as those would fire
for each packet/buffer received, which would defeat the MBDONE interrupt
purpose. The MBDONE interrupt is guaranteed to correspond to a
PDONE/BDONE interrupt when the threshold is set to 1, but offers
interrupt coalescing when the value is > 1.

Since the HW is configured to generate an interrupt when the ring
becomes emtpy, we have to deny any timeout/timer settings coming from
user-space to indicate we can only generate an interrupt very <N>
packets.

While we are at it, fix the DMA_INTR_THRESHOLD_MASK value which was off
by one bit (0xff vs. 0x1ff).
