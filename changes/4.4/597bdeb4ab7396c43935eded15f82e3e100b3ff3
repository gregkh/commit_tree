perf test: Keep test result clean if '-v' not set

According to [1], 'perf test' should avoid output too much information
if '-v' is not set, only 'Ok', 'FAIL' or 'Skip' need to be printed.

This patch removes several messages sent directly to stderr to make
the output clean.

Before this patch:

  # perf test dummy
  23: Test using a dummy software event to keep tracking       : (not supported) Ok

After this patch:

  # perf test dummy
  23: Test using a dummy software event to keep tracking       : Skip
