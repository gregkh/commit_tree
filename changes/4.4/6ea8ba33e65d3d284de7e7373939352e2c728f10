ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Check CPA bit in DSP core power down

Skylake driver will set the SPA bit to 0 to turn off the DSP core.
Driver will poll the Current Power Active (CPA) bit to match the
Set Power Active (SPA) bit value. When CPA bit matches the value
of SPA bit, the achieved power state has reached.

In case of DSP power down, register that was polled is SPA
instead of CPA. This patch corrects the register to be polled
in case of DSP power down.
