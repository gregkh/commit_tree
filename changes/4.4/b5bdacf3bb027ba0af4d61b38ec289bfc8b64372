net: Propagate lookup failure in l3mdev_get_saddr to caller

Commands run in a vrf context are not failing as expected on a route lookup:
    root@kenny:~# ip ro ls table vrf-red
    unreachable default

    root@kenny:~# ping -I vrf-red -c1 -w1 10.100.1.254
    ping: Warning: source address might be selected on device other than vrf-red.
    PING 10.100.1.254 (10.100.1.254) from 0.0.0.0 vrf-red: 56(84) bytes of data.

    --- 10.100.1.254 ping statistics ---
    2 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 999ms

Since the vrf table does not have a route for 10.100.1.254 the ping
should have failed. The saddr lookup causes a full VRF table lookup.
Propogating a lookup failure to the user allows the command to fail as
expected:

    root@kenny:~# ping -I vrf-red -c1 -w1 10.100.1.254
    connect: No route to host
