serial: 8250_dw: rename and comment the fallback dma filter

Adding comment where the purpose of the function is
explained.

The dma parameters are not used, so removing them, and also
moving the assignment of the function to the same place
where the other dw8250_data structures members are being set
in dw8250_probe.
