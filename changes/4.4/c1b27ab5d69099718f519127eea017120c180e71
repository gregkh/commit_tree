tile: provide CONFIG_PAGE_SIZE_64KB etc for tilepro

This allows the build system to know that it can't attempt to
configure the Lustre virtual block device, for example, when tilepro
is using 64KB pages (as it does by default).  The tilegx build
already provided those symbols.

Previously we required that the tilepro hypervisor be rebuilt with
a different hardcoded page size in its headers, and then Linux be
rebuilt using the updated hypervisor header.  Now we allow each of
the hypervisor and Linux to be built independently.  We still check
at boot time to ensure that the page size provided by the hypervisor
matches what Linux expects.
