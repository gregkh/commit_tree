ARM: OMAP3: clock: remove un-used core dpll re-program code

Remove the OMAP3 core DPLL re-program code, and the associated SRAM
code that does the low-level programming of the DPLL divider, idling
of the SDRAM etc.

This code was never fully implemented in the kernel; things missing
were driver side handling of core clock changes (they need to account
for their functional clock rate being changed on-the-fly), and the whole
framework required for handling this. Thus, there is not much point
to keep carrying the low-level support code either.
