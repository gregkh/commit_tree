ext4: make the bitmap read routines return real error codes

Make the bitmap reaading routines return real error codes (EIO,
EFSCORRUPTED, EFSBADCRC) which can then be reflected back to
userspace for more precise diagnosis work.

In particular, this means that mballoc no longer claims that we're out
of memory if the block bitmaps become corrupt.
