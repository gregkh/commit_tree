net: bcmgenet: Software reset EPHY after power on

The EPHY on GENET v1->v3 is extremely finicky, and will show occasional
failures based on the timing and reset sequence, ranging from duplicate
packets, to extremely high latencies.

Perform an additional software reset, and re-configuration to make sure it is
in a consistent and working state.
