fm10k: only prevent removal of default VID rules

This allows us to correctly add a VLAN even if it matches our default
VID. However, we don't want to remove the VID rules once that VLAN is
deleted. Correctly remove the stack layers information of the VLAN, but
then return to forwarding that VID as untagged frames. If we deleted the
VID rules here, we would begin dropping traffic due to VLAN membership
violations.
