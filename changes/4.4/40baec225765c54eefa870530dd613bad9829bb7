bonding: fix panic on non-ARPHRD_ETHER enslave failure

Since commit 7d5cd2ce529b, when bond_enslave fails on devices that
are not ARPHRD_ETHER, if needed, it resets the bonding device back to
ARPHRD_ETHER by calling ether_setup.

	Unfortunately, ether_setup clobbers dev->flags, clearing IFF_UP
if the bond device is up, leaving it in a quasi-down state without
having actually gone through dev_close.  For bonding, if any periodic
work queue items are active (miimon, arp_interval, etc), those will
remain running, as they are stopped by bond_close.  At this point, if
the bonding module is unloaded or the bond is deleted, the system will
panic when the work function is called.

	This panic is resolved by calling dev_close on the bond itself
prior to calling ether_setup.
