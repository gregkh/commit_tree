serial: 8250_omap: check how many bytes were injected

The function tty_insert_flip_string() returns an int and as such it
might fail. So the result is that I kindly asked to insert 48 bytes and
the function only insterted 32.
I have no idea what to do with the remaining 16 so I think dropping them
is the only option. I also increase the buf_overrun counter so userpace
has a clue that we lost bytes.
