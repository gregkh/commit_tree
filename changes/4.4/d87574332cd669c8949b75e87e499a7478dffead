clk:mxs: Fix bug on frequency divider

On drivers/clk/mxs/clk-frac.c, the function clk_frac_round_rate returned a bad
result. The division before multiplication computes a wrong value ; the
calculation is inverted to fix the problem. The second issue is that the exact
rate have decimals and they are truncate. The consequence is that the function
clk_frac_set_rate (which use the result of clk_frac_round_rate) computes a
wrong value for the register (the rate generated can be closer to the desired
rate). The correction is : if there is decimal to the result, it is rounded to
the next larger integer.
On drivers/clk/mxs/clk-frac.c, the function clk_frac_recalc_rate returned
a bad result. The multiplication is made before the division to compute a
correct value.
