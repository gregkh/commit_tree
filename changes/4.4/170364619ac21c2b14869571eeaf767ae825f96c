raid5-cache: free I/O units earlier

There is no good reason to keep the I/O unit structures around after the
stripe has been written back to the RAID array.  The only information
we need is the log sequence number, and the checkpoint offset of the
highest successfull writeback.  Store those in the log structure, and
free the IO units from __r5l_stripe_write_finished.

Besides simplifying the code this also avoid having to keep the allocation
for the I/O unit around for a potentially long time as superblock updates
that checkpoint the log do not happen very often.

This also fixes the previously incorrect calculation of 'free' in
r5l_do_reclaim as a side effect: previous if took the last unit which
isn't checkpointed into account.
