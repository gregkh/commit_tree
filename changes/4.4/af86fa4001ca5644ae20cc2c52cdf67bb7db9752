sparc/PCI: Add mem64 resource parsing for root bus

David reported that a T5-8 sparc system failed to boot with:

  pci_sun4v f02dbcfc: PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x804000000000-0x80400fffffff] (bus address [0x0000-0xfffffff])
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x800000000000-0x80007effffff] (bus address [0x00000000-0x7effffff])
  pci 0000:00:01.0: can't claim BAR 15 [mem 0x100000000-0x4afffffff pref]: no compatible bridge window

Note that we don't know about a host bridge aperture that contains
BAR 15.  OF does report a MEM64 aperture, but before this patch,
pci_determine_mem_io_space() ignored it.

Add support for host bridge apertures with 64-bit PCI addresses.  Also
set IORESOURCE_MEM_64 for PCI device and bridge resources in PCI 64-bit
memory space.

Sparc doesn't actually print the device and bridge resources, but after
this patch, we should have the equivalent of this:

  pci_sun4v f02dbcfc: PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x804000000000-0x80400fffffff] (bus address [0x0000-0xfffffff])
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x800000000000-0x80007effffff] (bus address [0x00000000-0x7effffff])
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x800100000000-0x8007ffffffff] (bus address [0x100000000-0x7ffffffff])
  pci 0000:00:01.0:   bridge window [mem 0x800100000000-0x8004afffffff 64bit pref]
