MIPS: Clean up compat_siginfo_t

While mips can't use the generic compat_siginfo_t directly because
its si_code and si_errno are inverted, we can still make it as
close to the generic version as possible. This makes it easier
to update when new members are added to siginfo_t.

The main changes are adding a missing _sigsys union member and
eliminating the unused _irix_sigchld one.
