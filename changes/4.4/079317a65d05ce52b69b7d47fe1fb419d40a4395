tty/serial: Skip 'NULL' char after console break when sysrq enabled

When sysrq is triggered from console, serial driver for SUN hypervisor
console receives a console break and enables the sysrq. It expects a valid
sysrq char following with break. Meanwhile if driver receives 'NULL'
ASCII char then it disables sysrq and sysrq handler will never be invoked.

This fix skips calling uart sysrq handler when 'NULL' is received while
sysrq is enabled.
