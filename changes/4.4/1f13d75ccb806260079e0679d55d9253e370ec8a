xen-blkback: only read request operation from shared ring once

A compiler may load a switch statement value multiple times, which could
be bad when the value is in memory shared with the frontend.

When converting a non-native request to a native one, ensure that
src->operation is only loaded once by using READ_ONCE().

This is part of XSA155.
