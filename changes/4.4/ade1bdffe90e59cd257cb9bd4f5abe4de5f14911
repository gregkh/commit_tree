ntp/pps: use y2038 safe types in pps_event_time

The pps_event_time uses two 'timespec' structures internally, which
suffer from the y2038 problem. The uses of this structure are
fairly self-contained in the pps code, so this replaces them all at
once.

Unfortunately, this includes the sfc ethernet driver aside from the
pps subsystem, so we change that one as well. Both touch the
same data structure, and there probably is no good way to split
the patch into smaller units.
