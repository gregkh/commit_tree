perf hists browser: Zoom in/out for processor socket

'perf report'.

This patch extends it for the processor sockets.

'S' is the short key to zoom into current Processor Socket.

[ - Made it elide the Socket column when zooming into it,
    just like with the other zoom ops;
  - Make it use browser->pstack, to unzoom level by level;
  - Rename 'socket' variables to 'socket_id' to make it build on
    older systems where it shadows a global glibc declaration ]
