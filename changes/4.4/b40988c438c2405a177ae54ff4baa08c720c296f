ieee802154: change mtu size behaviour

This patch changes the mtu size of 802.15.4 interfaces. The current
setting is the meaning of the maximum transport unit with mac header,
which is 127 bytes according 802.15.4. The linux meaning of the mtu size
field is the maximum payload of a mac frame. Like in ethernet, which is
1500 bytes.

We have dynamic length of mac frames in 802.15.4, this is why we assume
the minimum header length which is hard_header_len. This contains fc and
sequence fields. These can evaluated by driver layer without additional
checks. We currently don't support to set the FCS from userspace, so we
need to subtract this from mtu size as well.
