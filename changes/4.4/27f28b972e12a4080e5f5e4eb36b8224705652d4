mm/mmap.c: change __install_special_mapping() args order

Make __install_special_mapping() args order match the caller, so the
caller can pass their register args directly to callee with no touch.

For most of architectures, args (at least the first 5th args) are in
registers, so this change will have effect on most of architectures.

For -O2, __install_special_mapping() may be inlined under most of
architectures, but for -Os, it should not. So this change can get a
little better performance for -Os, at least.
