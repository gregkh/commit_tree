dm thin metadata: fix bug in dm_thin_remove_range()

dm_btree_remove_leaves() only unmaps a contiguous region so we need a
loop, in __remove_range(), to handle ranges that contain multiple
regions.

A new btree function, dm_btree_lookup_next(), is introduced which is
more efficiently able to skip over regions of the thin device which
aren't mapped.  __remove_range() uses dm_btree_lookup_next() for each
iteration of __remove_range()'s loop.

Also, improve description of dm_btree_remove_leaves().
