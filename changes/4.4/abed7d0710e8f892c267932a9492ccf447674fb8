xen: fix the check of e_pfn in xen_find_pfn_range

On some NUMA system, after dom0 up, we see below warning even if there are
enough pfn ranges that could be used for remapping:
"Unable to find available pfn range, not remapping identity pages"

Fix it to avoid getting a memory region of zero size in xen_find_pfn_range.
