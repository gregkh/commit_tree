intel_mid_powerbtn: Remove misuse of IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag

The IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag is used to identify the interrupts that should
be left enabled so as to allow them to work as expected during the
suspend-resume cycle, but doesn't guarantee that it will wake the system
from a suspended state, enable_irq_wake is recommended to be used for
the wakeup.

This patch removes the use of IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flags and uses newly
introduce PM wakeup APIs dev_pm_{set,clear}_wake_irq.
