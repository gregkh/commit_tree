xattr handlers: Pass handler to operations instead of flags

The xattr_handler operations are currently all passed a file system
specific flags value which the operations can use to disambiguate between
different handlers; some file systems use that to distinguish the xattr
namespace, for example.  In some oprations, it would be useful to also have
access to the handler prefix.  To allow that, pass a pointer to the handler
to operations instead of the flags value alone.
