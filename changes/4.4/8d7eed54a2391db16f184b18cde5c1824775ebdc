staging/lustre: use 64-bit times in another debug print

The ll_setattr_raw() function prints the new inode timestamps
along with the current time using '%lu', which overflows in
2106. This changes the printing of the current time for
now, the other two will change when we migrate the VFS code
to use 64-bit timestamps.
