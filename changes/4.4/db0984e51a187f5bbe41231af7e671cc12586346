ath10k: select board data based on BMI chip id and board id

QCA99X0 uses radio specific board names based on chip id and
board id combinations. We get these IDs from the target using BMI after otp.bin
has been started.

This patch reorders the call to the function ath10k_core_fetch_board_file
so that we have OTP binary before requesting for boardid-chipid. We get this
OTP data after parsing firmware-N.bin.

 all boards and detect if command is not supported]
