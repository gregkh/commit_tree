rcu: Stop silencing lockdep false positive for expedited grace periods

This reverts commit af859beaaba4 (rcu: Silence lockdep false positive
for expedited grace periods).  Because synchronize_rcu_expedited()
no longer invokes synchronize_sched_expedited(), ->exp_funnel_mutex
acquisition is no longer nested, so the false positive no longer happens.
This commit therefore removes the extra lockdep data structures, as they
are no longer needed.
