netlink: Rightsize IFLA_AF_SPEC size calculation

if_nlmsg_size() overestimates the minimum allocation size of netlink
dump request (when called from rtnl_calcit()) or the size of the
message (when called from rtnl_getlink()). This is because
ext_filter_mask is not supported by rtnl_link_get_af_size() and
rtnl_link_get_size().

The over-estimation is significant when at least one netdev has many
VLANs configured (8 bytes for each configured VLAN).

This patch-set "rightsizes" the protocol specific attribute size
calculation by propagating ext_filter_mask to rtnl_link_get_af_size()
and adding this a argument to get_link_af_size op in rtnl_af_ops.

Bridge module already used filtering aware sizing for notifications.
br_get_link_af_size_filtered() is consistent with the modified
get_link_af_size op so it replaces br_get_link_af_size() in br_af_ops.
br_get_link_af_size() becomes unused and thus removed.
