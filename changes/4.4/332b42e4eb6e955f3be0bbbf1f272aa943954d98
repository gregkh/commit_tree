parisc: Increase initial kernel mapping to 32MB on 64bit kernel

For the 64bit kernel the initially 16 MB kernel memory might become too
small if you build a kernel with many modules built-in and with kernel
text and data areas mapped on huge pages.

This patch increases the initial mapping to 32MB for 64bit kernels and
keeps 16MB for 32bit kernels.
