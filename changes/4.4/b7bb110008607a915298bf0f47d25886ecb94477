rfkill: copy the name into the rfkill struct

Some users of rfkill, like NFC and cfg80211, use a dynamic name when
allocating rfkill, in those cases dev_name(). Therefore, the pointer
passed to rfkill_alloc() might not be valid forever, I specifically
found the case that the rfkill name was quite obviously an invalid
pointer (or at least garbage) when the wiphy had been renamed.

Fix this by making a copy of the rfkill name in rfkill_alloc().
