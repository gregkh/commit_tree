bpf: add bpf_redirect() helper

Existing bpf_clone_redirect() helper clones skb before redirecting
it to RX or TX of destination netdev.
Introduce bpf_redirect() helper that does that without cloning.

Benchmarked with two hosts using 10G ixgbe NICs.
One host is doing line rate pktgen.
Another host is configured as:
$ tc qdisc add dev $dev ingress
$ tc filter add dev $dev root pref 10 u32 match u32 0 0 flowid 1:2 \
   action bpf run object-file tcbpf1_kern.o section clone_redirect_xmit drop
so it receives the packet on $dev and immediately xmits it on $dev + 1
The section 'clone_redirect_xmit' in tcbpf1_kern.o file has the program
that does bpf_clone_redirect() and performance is 2.0 Mpps

$ tc filter add dev $dev root pref 10 u32 match u32 0 0 flowid 1:2 \
   action bpf run object-file tcbpf1_kern.o section redirect_xmit drop
which is using bpf_redirect() - 2.4 Mpps

and using cls_bpf with integrated actions as:
$ tc filter add dev $dev root pref 10 \
  bpf run object-file tcbpf1_kern.o section redirect_xmit integ_act classid 1
performance is 2.5 Mpps

To summarize:
u32+act_bpf using clone_redirect - 2.0 Mpps
u32+act_bpf using redirect - 2.4 Mpps
cls_bpf using redirect - 2.5 Mpps

For comparison linux bridge in this setup is doing 2.1 Mpps
and ixgbe rx + drop in ip_rcv - 7.8 Mpps
