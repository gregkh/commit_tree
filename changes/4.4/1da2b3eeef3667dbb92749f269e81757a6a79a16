misc: mic: Remove COSM functionality from the MIC host driver

Since COSM functionality is now moved into a separate COSM driver
drivers, this patch removes this functionality from the base MIC host
driver. The MIC host driver now implements cosm_hw_ops and registers a
COSM device which allows the COSM driver to trigger
boot/shutdown/reset of the MIC devices via the cosm_hw_ops.
