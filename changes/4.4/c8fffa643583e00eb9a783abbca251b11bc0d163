vfs: remove stale comment in inode_operations

The big warning comment that is currently at the end of struct
inode_operations was added as part of this commit:

4aa7c6346be3 ("vfs: add i_op->dentry_open()")

It was added to warn people not to use the newly added 'dentry_open'
function pointer.

This function pointer was removed as part of this commit:

4bacc9c9234c ("overlayfs: Make f_path always point to the overlay and
		f_inode to the underlay")

The comment was left behind and now refers to nothing, so remove it.
