ALSA: rme96: Fix unexpected volume reset after rate changes

rme96 driver needs to reset DAC depending on the sample rate, and this
results in resetting to the max volume suddenly.  It's because of the
missing call of snd_rme96_apply_dac_volume().

However, calling this function right after the DAC reset still may not
work, and we need some delay before this call.  Since the DAC reset
and the procedure after that are performed in the spinlock, we delay
the DAC volume restore at the end after the spinlock.
