dm space map metadata: fix ref counting bug when bootstrapping a new space map

When applying block operations (BOPs) do not remove them from the
uncommitted BOP ring-buffer until after they've been applied -- in case
we recurse.

Also, perform BOP_INC operation, in dm_sm_metadata_create() and
sm_metadata_extend(), in terms of the uncommitted BOP ring-buffer rather
than using direct calls to sm_ll_inc().
