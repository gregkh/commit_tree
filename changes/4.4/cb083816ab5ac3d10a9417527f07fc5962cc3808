arm64: page-align sections for DEBUG_RODATA

A kernel built with DEBUG_RO_DATA && !CONFIG_DEBUG_ALIGN_RODATA doesn't
have .text aligned to a page boundary, though fixup_executable works at
page-granularity thanks to its use of create_mapping. If .text is not
page-aligned, the first page it exists in may be marked non-executable,
leading to failures when an attempt is made to execute code in said
page.

This patch upgrades ALIGN_DEBUG_RO and ALIGN_DEBUG_RO_MIN to force page
alignment for DEBUG_RO_DATA && !CONFIG_DEBUG_ALIGN_RODATA kernels,
ensuring that all sections with specific RWX permission requirements are
mapped with the correct permissions.
