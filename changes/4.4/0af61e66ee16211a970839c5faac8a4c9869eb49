drivers/staging: make emxx_udc.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/staging/emxx_udc/Kconfig:config USB_EMXX
drivers/staging/emxx_udc/Kconfig:       bool "EMXX USB Function Device Controller"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

The .remove function was declared __exit, so it wouldn't have been
available for a sysfs bind/unbind anyway, so lets be explicit here and
use ".suppress_bind_attrs = true" to prevent root from doing something
silly.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
