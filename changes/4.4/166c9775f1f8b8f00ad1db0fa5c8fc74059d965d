KVM: create kvm_irqfd.h

Move _irqfd_resampler and _irqfd struct declarations in a new
public header: kvm_irqfd.h. They are respectively renamed into
kvm_kernel_irqfd_resampler and kvm_kernel_irqfd. Those datatypes
will be used by architecture specific code, in the context of
IRQ bypass manager integration.
