arm/arm64: KVM: Add tracepoints for vgic and timer

The VGIC and timer code for KVM arm/arm64 doesn't have any tracepoints
or tracepoint infrastructure defined.  Rewriting some of the timer code
handling showed me how much we need this, so let's add these simple
trace points once and for all and we can easily expand with additional
trace points in these files as we go along.
