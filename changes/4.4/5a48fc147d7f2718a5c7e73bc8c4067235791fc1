block: blk_flush_integrity() for bio-based drivers

Since they lack requests to pin the request_queue active, synchronous
bio-based drivers may have in-flight integrity work from
bio_integrity_endio() that is not flushed by blk_freeze_queue().  Flush
that work to prevent races to free the queue and the final usage of the
blk_integrity profile.

This is temporary unless/until bio-based drivers start to generically
take a q_usage_counter reference while a bio is in-flight.
