drm/atomic: Make prepare_fb/cleanup_fb only take state, v3.

This removes the need to separately track fb changes i915.
That will be done as a separate commit, however.

Changes since v1:
- Add dri-devel to cc.
- Fix a check in intel's prepare and cleanup fb to take rotation
  into account.
Changes since v2:
- Split out i915 changes to a separate commit.
