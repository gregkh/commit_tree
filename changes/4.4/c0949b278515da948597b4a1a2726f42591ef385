ALSA: firewire-tascam: add skeleton for TASCAM FireWire series

This commit adds a new driver for TASCAM FireWire series. In this commit,
this driver just creates/removes card instance according to bus event.
More functionalities will be added in following commits.

TASCAM FireWire series consists of:
 * PDI 1394P23 for IEEE 1394 PHY layer
 * PDI 1394L40 for IEEE 1394 LINK layer and IEC 61883 interface
 * XILINX XC9536XL
 * XILINX Spartan-II XC2S100
 * ATMEL AT91M42800A

Ilya Zimnovich had investigated TASCAM FireWire series in 2011, and
discover some features of his FW-1804. You can see a part of his research
in FFADO project.

A part of my work are based on Ilya's investigation, while this series
doesn't support the FW-1804, because of a lack of config ROM
information and its protocol detail, especially for PCM channels.

I observed that FW-1884 and FW-1082 don't work properly with 1394 OHCI
controller based on VT6315. The controller can actually communicate packets
to these models, while these models generate no sounds. It may be due to
the PHY/LINK layer issues. Using 1394 OHCI controller produced by the other
vendors such as Texas Instruments may work. Or adding another node on the
bus.
