cxlflash: Fix to avoid lock instrumentation rejection

When running with lock instrumentation (e.g. lockdep), some of the
instrumentation can become disabled at probe time for a cxlflash
adapter. This is due to a missing lock registration for the tmf_slock.

The fix is to call spin_lock_init() for the tmf_slock during probe.
