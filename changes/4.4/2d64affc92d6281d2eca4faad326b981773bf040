Revert "ARC: dw2 unwind: Ignore CIE version !=1 gracefully instead of bailing"

Blingly ignoring CIE.version != 1 was a bad idea.
It still leaves "desirability" when running perf with callgraphing where libgcc
symbols might show in hotspot.

More importantly, basic CIE.version == 3 support already exists in code:

|
|   retAddrReg = state.version <= 1 ? *ptr++ : get_uleb128(&ptr, end);
|

Next commit with simply add continue-not-bail for CIE.version != 1

This reverts commit 323f41f9e7d0cb5b1d1586aded6682855f1e646d.
