ARM: 8471/1: need to save/restore arm register(r11) when it is corrupted

In cpu_v7_do_suspend routine, r11 is used while it is NOT
saved/restored, different compiler may have different usage
of ARM general registers, so it may cause issues during
calling cpu_v7_do_suspend.

We meet kernel fault occurs when using GCC 4.8.3, r11 contains
valid value before calling into cpu_v7_do_suspend, but when returned
from this routine, r11 is corrupted and lead to kernel fault.
Doing save/restore for those corrupted registers is a must in
assemble code.
