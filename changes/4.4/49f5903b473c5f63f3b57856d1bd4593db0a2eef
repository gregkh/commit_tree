rcu: Move preemption disabling out of __srcu_read_lock()

Currently, __srcu_read_lock() cannot be invoked from restricted
environments because it contains calls to preempt_disable() and
preempt_enable(), both of which can invoke lockdep, which is a bad
idea in some restricted execution modes.  This commit therefore moves
the preempt_disable() and preempt_enable() from __srcu_read_lock()
to srcu_read_lock().  It also inserts the preempt_disable() and
preempt_enable() around the call to __srcu_read_lock() in do_exit().
