ARM: 8454/1: OF implies OF_FLATTREE

On the ARM architecture, individual platforms select CONFIG_USE_OF if they
need it, but all device tree code is keyed off CONFIG_OF. When building
a platform without DT support and manually enabling CONFIG_OF, we now
get a number of build errors, e.g.

arch/arm/kernel/devtree.c: In function 'setup_machine_fdt':
arch/arm/kernel/devtree.c:215:19: error: implicit declaration of function 'early_init_dt_verify' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

We could now try to separate the use case of booting from DT vs. the
case of using the dynamic implementation, but that seems more complicated
than it can gain us.

This simply changes the ARM Kconfig file to always enable OF_RESERVED_MEM
and OF_EARLY_FLATTREE when CONFIG_OF is enabled. These options add a little
extra code when we just want the dynamic OF implementation, but that seems
like a rather obscure case, and this version solves all CONFIG_OF related
randconfig regressions.
