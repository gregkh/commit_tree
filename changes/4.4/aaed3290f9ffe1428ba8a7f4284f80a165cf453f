staging: wilc1000: wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.c : removes unused local variables

This patch removes useless local variable, s32Error and returns directly
zero from wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.c and also removes incorrect break in
switch-case statement. The break is not useless which is being called right
after return statement.
