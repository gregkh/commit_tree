ath10k: add QCA9377 chipset support

Add the hardware name, revision and update the pci_id table.

Currently there're two HW ref. designs available I'm aware of,
with 1.0.2 and 1.1 chip revisions. I've access and been using
the first one so far and this patch cover only it.

QCA9377 inherits most of the stuff (e.g. fw interfaces)
from QCA61x4 design, so the integration was pretty straightforward.
