NFC: nci: Allow the driver to set handler for core nci ops

The driver may be required to act when some responses or
notifications arrive. For example the NCI core does not have a
handler for NCI_OP_CORE_GET_CONFIG_RSP. The NFCC can send a
config response that has to be read by the driver and the packet
may contain vendor specific data.

The Fields Peak driver needs to take certain actions when a reset
notification arrives (packet also not handled by the nfc core).

The driver handlers do not interfere with the core and they are
called after the core processes the packet.
