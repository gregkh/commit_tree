ASoC: compress: add config item for soc-compress to make it compiled only when needed

We don't always need soc-compress in soc, here add a config item
SND_SOC_COMPRESS, when nobody select it, the soc-compress will
not be compiled.

Here also change Kconfig to 'select SND_SOC_COMPRESS' for drivers
that needed soc-compress.
