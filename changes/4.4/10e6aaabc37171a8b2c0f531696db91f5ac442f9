toshiba_acpi: Remove unneeded u32 variables from *setup_keyboard

The function toshiba_acpi_setup_keyboard currently has two u32 variables
used to store the Hotkey Event Type and the result of the HCI_SYSTEM_EVENT
query.

This patch removes those two variables, as we already have a global
variable named "hotkey_event_type" and the result of the HCI_SYSTEM_EVENT
query can be checked directly from the function.
