net: cdc_mbim: add "NDP to end" quirk for Huawei E3372

The Huawei E3372 (12d1:157d) needs this quirk in MBIM mode
as well. Allow this by forcing the NTB to contain only a
single NDP, and add a device specific entry for this ID.

Due to the way Huawei use device IDs, this might be applied
to other modems as well.  It is assumed that those modems
will be based on the same firmware and will need this quirk
too.  If not, it will still not harm normal usage, although
multiplexing performance could be impacted.
