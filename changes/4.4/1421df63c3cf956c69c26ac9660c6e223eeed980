cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add separate support for Airmont cores

There are two flavors of Atom cores to be supported by intel_pstate,
Silvermont and Airmont, so make the driver distinguish between them by
adding separate frequency tables.

Separate the CPU defaults params for each of them and match the CPU IDs
against them as appropriate.
