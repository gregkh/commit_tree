Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Remove needless looking code

Tree wide grep for "hci_bcm" doesn't reveal there is any code registering
this platform device and "struct acpi_device_id" use for passing the
platform data looks a debug/test code leftover to me.

I'm assuming this driver effectively supports only ACPI enumeration and
thus test for ACPI_HANDLE() and platform data can be removed.
