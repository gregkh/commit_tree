mm, compaction: distinguish contended status in tracepoints

Compaction returns prematurely with COMPACT_PARTIAL when contended or has
fatal signal pending.  This is ok for the callers, but might be misleading
in the traces, as the usual reason to return COMPACT_PARTIAL is that we
think the allocation should succeed.  After this patch we distinguish the
premature ending condition in the mm_compaction_finished and
mm_compaction_end tracepoints.

The contended status covers the following reasons:
- lock contention or need_resched() detected in async compaction
- fatal signal pending
- too many pages isolated in the zone (only for async compaction)
Further distinguishing the exact reason seems unnecessary for now.
