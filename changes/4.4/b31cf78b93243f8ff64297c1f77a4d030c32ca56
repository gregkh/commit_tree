drm/nouveau/ttm: set the DMA mask for platform devices

So far the DMA mask was not set for platform devices, which limited them
to a 32-bit physical space. Allow dma_set_mask() to be called for
non-PCI devices, and also take the IOMMU bit into account since it could
restrict the physically addressable space.
