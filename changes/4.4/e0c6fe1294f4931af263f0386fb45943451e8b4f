staging: comedi: comedi_test: allow read-back of AO channels

COMEDI drivers often allow the last value written to a channel on an
analog output subdevice to be read back via the "insn_read" handler.
The "comedi_test" driver does not currently support that.  It is a bit
special because it loops back the last values written to the channel on
the analog output subdevice to be read back via corresponding channels
on the analog input subdevice.  The "insn_read" handler for the analog
input subdevice is `waveform_ai_insn_read()`.  Set that as the
"insn_read" handler for the analog output subdevice as well.
