serial: of-serial: compile correctly when 8250 driver is compiled as module

If the 8250 driver is compiled as a module then
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_MODULE is defined and not CONFIG_SERIAL_8250.

This results in all those code sections that require CONFIG_SERIAL_8250
to be defined are not included.

This patch fixes the situation and allows 8250 and of-serial to
be compiled as a module with the same functionality as when
compiled into the kernel.
