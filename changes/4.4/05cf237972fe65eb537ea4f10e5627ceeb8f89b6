ASoC: fsl_ssi: Add driver suspend and resume to support MEGA Fast

For i.MX6 SoloX, there is a mode of the SoC to shutdown all power
source of modules during system suspend and resume procedure. Thus,
SSI needs to save all the values of registers before the system
suspend and restore them after the system resume.

The register SFCSR is volatile, but some bits in it need to be
recovered after suspend/resume.
