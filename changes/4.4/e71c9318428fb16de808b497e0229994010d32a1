fm10k: send traffic on default VID to VLAN device if we have one

This patch ensures that VLAN traffic on the default VID will go to the
corresponding VLAN device if it exists. To do this, mask the rx_ring VID
if we have an active VLAN on that VID.

For this to work correctly, we need to update fm10k_process_skb_fields
to correctly mask off the VLAN_PRIO_MASK bits and compare them
separately, otherwise we incorrectly compare the priority bits with the
cleared flag. This also happens to fix a related bug where having
priority bits set causes us to incorrectly classify traffic.
