clk: Make of_clk_get_parent_name() robust with #clock-cells = 1

If a clock provider has #clock-cells = 1 and we call
of_clk_get_parent_name() on it we may end up returning the name
of the provider node if the provider doesn't have a
clock-output-names property. This doesn't make sense, especially
when you consider that calling of_clk_get_parent_name() on such a
node with different indices will return the same name each time.

Let's try getting the clock from the framework via of_clk_get()
instead, and only fallback to the node name if we have a provider
with #clock-cells = 0. This way, we can't hand out the same name
for different clocks when we don't actually know their names.
