sctp: use the same clock as if sock source timestamps were on

SCTP echoes a cookie o INIT ACK chunks that contains a timestamp, for
detecting stale cookies. This cookie is echoed back to the server by the
client and then that timestamp is checked.

Thing is, if the listening socket is using packet timestamping, the
cookie is encoded with ktime_get() value and checked against
ktime_get_real(), as done by __net_timestamp().

The fix is to sctp also use ktime_get_real(), so we can compare bananas
with bananas later no matter if packet timestamping was enabled or not.
