net: Add support for filtering neigh dump by master device

Add support for filtering neighbor dumps by master device by adding
the NDA_MASTER attribute to the dump request. A new netlink flag,
NLM_F_DUMP_FILTERED, is added to indicate the kernel supports the
request and output is filtered as requested.
