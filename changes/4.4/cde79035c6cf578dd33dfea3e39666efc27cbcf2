ASoC: Handle multiple codecs with split playback / capture

Add the capability to use multiple codecs on the same DAI linke where
one codec is used for playback and another one is used for capture.

Tested on a setup using an SSM2518 for playback and an ICS43432 I2S MEMS
microphone for capture.

No verification is made that the playback and capture codec setups are
compatible in terms of number of TDM slots (where applicable).
