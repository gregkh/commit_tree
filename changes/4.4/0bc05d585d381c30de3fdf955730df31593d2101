switchdev: allow caller to explicitly request attr_set as deferred

Caller should know if he can call attr_set directly (when holding RTNL)
or if he has to defer the att_set processing for later.

This also allows drivers to sleep inside attr_set and report operation
status back to switchdev core. Switchdev core then warns if status is
not ok, instead of silent errors happening in drivers.

Benefit from newly introduced switchdev deferred ops infrastructure.
