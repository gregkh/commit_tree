drm/i915: avoid the last 8mb of stolen on BDW/SKL

The FBC hardware for these platforms doesn't have access to the
bios_reserved range, so it always assumes the maximum (8mb) is used.
So avoid this range while allocating.

This solves a bunch of FIFO underruns that happen if you end up
putting the CFB in that memory range. On my machine, with 32mb of
stolen, I need a 2560x1440 mode for that.

Testcase: igt/kms_frontbuffer_tracking/fbc-* (given the right setup)
