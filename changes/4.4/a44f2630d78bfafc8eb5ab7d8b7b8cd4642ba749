misc: mic: SCIF RMA header file and IOCTL changes

This patch updates the SCIF header file and IOCTL interface with the
changes required to support RMAs.  APIs added include the ability to
pin pages and register those pages with SCIF. SCIF kernel clients can
also add references to remote registered pages and access them via the
CPU. The user space IOCTL interface has been updated to enable SCIF
registration, RDMA/CPU copies and fence APIs for RDMA synchronization.
