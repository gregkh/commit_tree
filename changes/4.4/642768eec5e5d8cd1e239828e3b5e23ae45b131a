staging: wilc1000: remove wrappers around sema_init()

Just call the function directly.  Also remove a pointless "deinit"
function that was empty to match the init function.

This also fixes a bug where txq_add_to_head_cs was a mutex structure
being used as a semaphore.  See the fun things that happen when you use
void pointers instead of "real" types?  Amazing that this worked at all,
someone got _very_ lucky.  Whoever "Amr" is, they really didn't fix
BugID_4720 correctly :(
