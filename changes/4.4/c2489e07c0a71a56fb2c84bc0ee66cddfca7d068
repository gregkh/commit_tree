vfs: Avoid softlockups with sendfile(2)

The following test program from Dmitry can cause softlockups or RCU
stalls as it copies 1GB from tmpfs into eventfd and we don't have any
scheduling point at that path in sendfile(2) implementation:

        int r1 = eventfd(0, 0);
        int r2 = memfd_create("", 0);
        unsigned long n = 1<<30;
        fallocate(r2, 0, 0, n);
        sendfile(r1, r2, 0, n);

Add cond_resched() into __splice_from_pipe() to fix the problem.
