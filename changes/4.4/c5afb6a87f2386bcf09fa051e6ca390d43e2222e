sched/fair: Fix nohz.next_balance update

Since commit:

  d4573c3e1c99 ("sched: Improve load balancing in the presence of idle CPUs")

the ILB CPU starts with the idle load balancing of other idle CPUs and
finishes with itself in order to speed up the spread of tasks in all
idle CPUs.

The this_rq->next_balance is still used in nohz_idle_balance() as an
intermediate step to gather the shortest next balance before updating
nohz.next_balance. But the former has not been updated yet and is likely to
be set with the current jiffies. As a result, the nohz.next_balance will be
set with current jiffies instead of the real next balance date. This
generates spurious kicks of nohz ilde balance.

nohz_idle_balance() must set the nohz.next_balance without taking into
account this_rq->next_balance which is not updated yet. Then, this_rq will
update nohz.next_update with its next_balance once updated and if necessary.
