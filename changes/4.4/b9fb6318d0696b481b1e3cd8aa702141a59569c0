staging/rdma/hfi1: Prevent silent data corruption with user SDMA

User SDMA keeps track of progress into the submitted IO vectors by tracking an
offset into the vectors when packets are submitted. This offset is updated
after a successful submission of a txreq to the SDMA engine.

The same offset was used when determining whether an IO vector should be
'freed' (pages unpinned) in the SDMA callback functions.

This was causing a silent data corruption in big jobs (> 2 nodes, 120 ranks
each) on the receive side because the send side was mistakenly unpinning the
vector pages before the HW has processed all descriptors referencing the
vector.
