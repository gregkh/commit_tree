serial_core: support native endianness

There are three natural ways in which devices may be wired to the system:
little endian (device receives correctly ordered bits of a word written
by little-endian CPU to its register, but big-endian CPU needs to swap
bytes of a word before writing it), big endian (same, but with big-endian
CPU in more favourable position) and native endian (CPU of either
endianness may do word-sized I/O without need for byteswapping).

Adding an option for native endianness allows using single kernel command
line for boards with native-endian serial ports on bi-endian
architectures. This goes in parallel with 'native-endian' DTS attribute.
