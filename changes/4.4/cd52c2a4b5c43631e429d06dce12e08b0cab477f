clk: add support for clocks provided by SCP(System Control Processor)

On some ARM based systems, a separate Cortex-M based System Control
Processor(SCP) provides the overall power, clock, reset and system
control. System Control and Power Interface(SCPI) Message Protocol
is defined for the communication between the Application Cores(AP)
and the SCP.

This patch adds support for the clocks provided by SCP using SCPI
protocol.
