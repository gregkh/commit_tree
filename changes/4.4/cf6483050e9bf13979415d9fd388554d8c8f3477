drm/irq: Add drm_crtc_vblank_count_and_time()

This function is the KMS native variant of drm_vblank_count_and_time().
It takes a struct drm_crtc * instead of a struct drm_device * and an
index of the CRTC.

Eventually the goal is to access vblank data through the CRTC only so
that the per-CRTC data can be moved to struct drm_crtc.
