spi: pxa2xx: Remove two variables from struct chip_data

There is no need to carry spi->max_speed_hz and spi->bits_per_word from
setup() in "struct chip_data" since pump_transfers() will anyway take the
transfer parameters from "struct spi_transfer". This is since SPI core
validates both bits_per_word and speed_hz transfer parameters and defaults
to spi->bits_per_word and spi->max_speed_hz in case these per transfer
parameters are not set.
