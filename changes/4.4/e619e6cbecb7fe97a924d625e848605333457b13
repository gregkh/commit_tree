Revert "scsi: Fix a bdi reregistration race"

The SCSI sd driver probes SCSI devices asynchronously. The sd_remove()
function, called indirectly by device_del(), waits until asynchronous
probing has finished. Since the block layer queue must only be cleaned
up after probing has finished, device_del() has to be called before
blk_cleanup_queue(). Hence revert commit bf2cf3baa20b.
