rcu: Switch synchronize_sched_expedited() to IPI

This commit switches synchronize_sched_expedited() from stop_one_cpu_nowait()
to smp_call_function_single(), thus moving from an IPI and a pair of
context switches to an IPI and a single pass through the scheduler.
Of course, if the scheduler actually does decide to switch to a different
task, there will still be a pair of context switches, but there would
likely have been a pair of context switches anyway, just a bit later.
