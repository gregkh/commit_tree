bridge: vlan: enforce no pvid flag in vlan ranges

Currently it's possible for someone to send a vlan range to the kernel
with the pvid flag set which will result in the pvid bouncing from a
vlan to vlan and isn't correct, it also introduces problems for hardware
where it doesn't make sense having more than 1 pvid. iproute2 already
enforces this, so let's enforce it on kernel-side as well.
