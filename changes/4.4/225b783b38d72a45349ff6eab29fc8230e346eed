[media] saa7164: video and vbi ports share the same input/tuner/std

The vbi port should pass any tuner/input/standard information on
to the video port since in the input and tuner are shared between
the two.

There is no reason to duplicate this code, just pass the ioctls on
to the video encoder port.
