mm: simplify page migration's anon_vma comment and flow

__unmap_and_move() contains a long stale comment on page_get_anon_vma()
and PageSwapCache(), with an odd control flow that's hard to follow.
Mostly this reflects our confusion about the lifetime of an anon_vma, in
the early days of page migration, before we could take a reference to one.
 Nowadays this seems quite straightforward: cut it all down to essentials.

I cannot see the relevance of swapcache here at all, so don't treat it any
differently: I believe the old comment reflects in part our anon_vma
confusions, and in part the original v2.6.16 page migration technique,
which used actual swap to migrate anon instead of swap-like migration
entries.  Why should a swapcache page not be migrated with the aid of
migration entry ptes like everything else?  So lose that comment now, and
enable migration entries for swapcache in the next patch.
