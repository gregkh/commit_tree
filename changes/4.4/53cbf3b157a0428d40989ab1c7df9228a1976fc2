fs: direct-io: don't dirtying pages for ITER_BVEC/ITER_KVEC direct read

When direct read IO is submitted from kernel, it is often
unnecessary to dirty pages, for example of loop, dirtying pages
have been considered in the upper filesystem(over loop) side
already, and they don't need to be dirtied again.

So this patch doesn't dirtying pages for ITER_BVEC/ITER_KVEC
direct read, and loop should be the 1st case to use ITER_BVEC/ITER_KVEC
for direct read I/O.

The patch is based on previous Dave's patch.
