netfilter: conntrack: fix crash on timeout object removal

The object and module refcounts are updated for each conntrack template,
however, if we delete the iptables rules and we flush the timeout
database, we may end up with invalid references to timeout object that
are just gone.

Resolve this problem by setting the timeout reference to NULL when the
custom timeout entry is removed from our base. This patch requires some
RCU trickery to ensure safe pointer handling.

This handling is similar to what we already do with conntrack helpers,
the idea is to avoid bumping the timeout object reference counter from
the packet path to avoid the cost of atomic ops.
