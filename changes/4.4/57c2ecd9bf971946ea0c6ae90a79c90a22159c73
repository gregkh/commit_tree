spi: spi-ti-qspi: switch to polling mode for better r/w performance

Currently word completion interrupt is fired for transfer of every
word(8bit to 128bit in size). This adds a lot of overhead, and decreases
r/w throughput. It hardly takes 3us(@48MHz) for 128bit r/w to complete,
hence its better to poll on word complete bit to be set in
QSPI_SPI_STATUS_REG instead of using interrupts.
This increases the throughput by 30% in both read and write case.

So, switch to polling mode instead of interrupts to determine completion
of word transfer.
