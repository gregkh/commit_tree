direct-io: Fix negative return from dio read beyond eof

Assume a filesystem with 4KB blocks. When a file has size 1000 bytes and
we issue direct IO read at offset 1024, blockdev_direct_IO() reads the
tail of the last block and the logic for handling short DIO reads in
dio_complete() results in a return value -24 (1000 - 1024) which
obviously confuses userspace.

Fix the problem by bailing out early once we sample i_size and can
reliably check that direct IO read starts beyond i_size.
