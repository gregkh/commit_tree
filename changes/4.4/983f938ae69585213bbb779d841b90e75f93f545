tracing: Move trace_flags from global to a trace_array field

In preparation to make trace options per instance, the global trace_flags
needs to be moved from being a global variable to a field within the trace
instance trace_array structure.

There's still more work to do, as there's some functions that use
trace_flags without passing in a way to get to the current_trace array. For
those, the global_trace is used directly (from trace.c). This includes
setting and clearing the trace_flags. This means that when a new instance is
created, it just gets the trace_flags of the global_trace and will not be
able to modify them. Depending on the functions that have access to the
trace_array, the flags of an instance may not affect parts of its trace,
where the global_trace is used. These will be fixed in future changes.
