mtd: nand: remove unused ->init_size() hook

The ->init_size() hook was introduced to let NAND controller drivers
support NAND devices that could not be described in the nand_ids table.
Since then, the core has added support for extended-id parsing and
full-id description, thus allowing to describe pretty much all existing
NANDs.
Moreover, this hook is not used by any mainline driver, and should not be
used by new drivers, because detecting the NAND chip is not something
controller specific.
