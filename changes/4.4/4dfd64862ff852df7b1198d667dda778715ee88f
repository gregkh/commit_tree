drm: Use vblank timestamps to guesstimate how many vblanks were missed

When lacking am accurate hardware frame counter, we can fall back to
using the vblank timestamps to guesstimagte how many vblanks have
elapsed since the last time the vblank counter was updated.

Take the oppostunity to unify the vblank_disable_and_save() and
drm_handle_vblank_events() to call the same function
(drm_update_vblank_count()) to perform the vblank updates.

If the hardware/driver has an accurate frame counter use it instead of
the timestamp based guesstimate. If the hardware/driver has neither
a frame counter nor acurate vblank timestamps, we fall back to assuming
that each drm_handle_vblank_events() should increment the vblank count
by one.
