Btrfs: use BTRFS_ERROR_DEV_MISSING_NOT_FOUND when missing device is not found

Use btrfs specific error code BTRFS_ERROR_DEV_MISSING_NOT_FOUND instead
of -ENOENT.  Next this removes the logging when user specifies "missing"
and we don't find it in the kernel device list. Logging are for system
events not for user input errors.
