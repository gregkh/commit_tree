block/xen-blkfront: split get_grant in 2

Prepare the code to support 64KB page granularity. The first
implementation will use a full Linux page per indirect and persistent
grant. When non-persistent grant is used, each page of a bio request
may be split in multiple grant.

Furthermore, the field page of the grant structure is only used to copy
data from persistent grant or indirect grant. Avoid to set it for other
use case as it will have no meaning given the page will be split in
multiple grant.

Provide 2 functions, to setup indirect grant, the other for bio page.
