cgroup: make cgroup_destroy_locked() test cgroup_is_populated()

cgroup_destroy_locked() currently tests whether any css_sets are
associated to reject removal if the cgroup contains tasks.  This works
because a css_set's refcnt converges with the number of tasks linked
to it and thus there's no css_set linked to a cgroup if it doesn't
have any live tasks.

To help tracking resource usage of zombie tasks, putting the ref of
css_set will be separated from disassociating the task from the
css_set which means that a cgroup may have css_sets linked to it even
when it doesn't have any live tasks.

This patch updates cgroup_destroy_locked() so that it tests
cgroup_is_populated(), which counts the number of populated css_sets,
instead of whether cgrp->cset_links is empty to determine whether the
cgroup is populated or not.  This ensures that rmdirs won't be
incorrectly rejected for cgroups which only contain zombie tasks.
