Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Do not test ACPI companion in bcm_acpi_probe()

This device has always ACPI companion because driver supports only ACPI
enumeration. Therefore there is no need to test it in bcm_acpi_probe() and
we can pass it directly to acpi_dev_get_resources() (which will return
-EINVAL in case of NULL argument is passed).
