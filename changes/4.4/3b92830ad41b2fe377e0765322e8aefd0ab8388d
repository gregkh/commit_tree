KVM: arm/arm64: implement kvm_arm_[halt,resume]_guest

We introduce kvm_arm_halt_guest and resume functions. They
will be used for IRQ forward state change.

Halt is synchronous and prevents the guest from being re-entered.
We use the same mechanism put in place for PSCI former pause,
now renamed power_off. A new flag is introduced in arch vcpu state,
pause, only meant to be used by those functions.
