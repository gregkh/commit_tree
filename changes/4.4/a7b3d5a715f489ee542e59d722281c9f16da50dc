arm: berlin: add CPU hotplug support

Add cpu hotplug support for berlin SoCs such as BG2 and BG2Q. These SoC
don't support power off cpu independently, but we also want cpu hotplug
support in these SoCs. We achieve this goal by putting the dying CPU in
WFI state after the coherency is disabled, then asserting the dying CPU
reset bit to put the CPU in reset state.
