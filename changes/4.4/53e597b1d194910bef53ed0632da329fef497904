ALSA: Remove transfer_ack_{begin,end} callbacks from struct snd_pcm_runtime

While there is nothing wrong with the transfer_ack_begin and
transfer_ack_end callbacks per-se, the last documented user was part of the
alsa-driver 0.5.12a package, which was released 14 years ago and even
predates the upstream integration of the ALSA core and has subsequently
been superseded by newer alsa-driver releases.

This seems to indicate that there is no need for having these callbacks and
they are just cruft that can be removed.
