Revert "thermal: qcom_spmi: allow compile test"

This just caused build errors:

warning: (QCOM_SPMI_TEMP_ALARM) selects REGMAP_SPMI which has unmet direct dependencies (SPMI)
drivers/built-in.o: In function `regmap_spmi_ext_gather_write':
:(.text+0x609b0): undefined reference to `spmi_ext_register_write'
:(.text+0x609f0): undefined reference to `spmi_ext_register_writel'

While it's generally a good idea to allow compile testing, in this
case, it just doesn't work, so reverting the patch that
introduced the compile-test variant seems the most appropriate
solution.

Note that SPMI also has a 'depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST'
statement, so we should be able to enable SPMI on all architectures
for compile testing already.
