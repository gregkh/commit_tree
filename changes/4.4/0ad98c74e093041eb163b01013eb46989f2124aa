drm/i915: Determine the stolen memory base address on gen2

There isn't an explicit stolen memory base register on gen2.
Some old comment in the i915 code suggests we should get it via
max_low_pfn_mapped, but that's clearly a bad idea on my MGM.

The e820 map in said machine looks like this:
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000000009f7ff] usable
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000000009f800-0x000000000009ffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000000ce000-0x00000000000cffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000000dc000-0x00000000000fffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x000000001f6effff] usable
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000001f6f0000-0x000000001f6f7fff] ACPI data
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000001f6f8000-0x000000001f6fffff] ACPI NVS
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000001f700000-0x000000001fffffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fec10000-0x00000000fec1ffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000ffb00000-0x00000000ffbfffff] reserved
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fff00000-0x00000000ffffffff] reserved

That makes max_low_pfn_mapped = 1f6f0000, so assuming our stolen memory
would start there would place it on top of some ACPI memory regions.
So not a good idea as already stated.

The 9MB region after the ACPI regions at 0x1f700000 however looks
promising given that the macine reports the stolen memory size to be
8MB. Looking at the PGTBL_CTL register, the GTT entries are at offset
0x1fee00000, and given that the GTT entries occupy 128KB, it looks like
the stolen memory could start at 0x1f700000 and the GTT entries would
occupy the last 128KB of the stolen memory.

After some more digging through chipset documentation, I've determined
the BIOS first allocates space for something called TSEG (something to
do with SMM) from the top of memory, and then it allocates the graphics
stolen memory below that. Accordind to the chipset documentation TSEG
has a fixed size of 1MB on 855. So that explains the top 1MB in the
e820 region. And it also confirms that the GTT entries are in fact at
the end of the the stolen memory region.

Derive the stolen memory base address on gen2 the same as the BIOS does
(TOM-TSEG_SIZE-stolen_size). There are a few differences between the
registers on various gen2 chipsets, so a few different codepaths are
required.

865G is again bit more special since it seems to support enough memory
to hit 4GB address space issues. This means the PCI allocations will
also affect the location of the stolen memory. Fortunately there
appears to be the TOUD register which may give us the correct answer
directly. But the chipset docs are a bit unclear, so I'm not 100%
sure that the graphics stolen memory is always the last thing the
BIOS steals. Someone would need to verify it on a real system.

I tested this on the my 830 and 855 machines, and so far everything
looks peachy.

v2: Rewrite to use the TOM-TSEG_SIZE-stolen_size and TOUD methods
v3: Fix TSEG size for 830
v4: Add missing 'else' (Chris)
