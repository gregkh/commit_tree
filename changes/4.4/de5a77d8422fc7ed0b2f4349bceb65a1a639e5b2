xen/balloon: rationalize memory hotplug stats

The stats used for memory hotplug make no sense and are fiddled with
in odd ways.  Remove them and introduce total_pages to track the total
number of pages (both populated and unpopulated) including those within
hotplugged regions (note that this includes not yet onlined pages).

This will be used in a subsequent commit (xen/balloon: only hotplug
additional memory if required) when deciding whether additional memory
needs to be hotplugged.
