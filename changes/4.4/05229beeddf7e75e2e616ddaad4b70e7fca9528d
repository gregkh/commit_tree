block: add block polling support

Add basic support for polling for specific IO to complete. This uses
the cookie that blk-mq passes back, which enables the block layer
to pass this cookie to the driver to spin for a specific request.

This will be combined with request latency tracking, so we can make
qualified decisions about when to poll and when not to. For now, for
benchmark purposes, we add a sysfs file that controls whether polling
is enabled or not.
