8139cp: Fix GSO MSS handling

When fixing the TSO support I noticed we just mask ->gso_size with the
MSSMask value and don't care about the consequences.

Provide a .ndo_features_check() method which drops the NETIF_F_TSO
feature for any skb which would exceed the maximum, and thus forces it
to be segmented by software.

Then we can stop the masking in cp_start_xmit(), and just WARN if the
maximum is exceeded, which should now never happen.

Finally, Francois Romieu noticed that we didn't even have the right
value for MSSMask anyway; it should be 0x7ff (11 bits) not 0xfff.
