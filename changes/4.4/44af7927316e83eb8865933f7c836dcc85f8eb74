spi: Map SPI OF client IRQ at probe time

Currently the IRQs for SPI client devices, registered via device-tree,
are mapped when the client devices are registered. If the corresponding
irq-chip has not been probed yet, then the probing of the client device
will fail and will not be retried. Resolve this by mapping the IRQ at
probe time and allow the probe to be deferred if the IRQ is not yet
available.

If of_irq_get() returns an error that is not -EPROBE_DEFER, then assume
that the SPI client does not have an IRQ and set the IRQ number to zero
(which is equivalent to irq_of_parse_and_map()).

This is based on some inputs from Thierry Reding <treding@nvidia.com>.
