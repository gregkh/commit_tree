serial: 8250_dw: proper support for UARTs without busy functionality

If the DW_apb_uart is configured with UART_16550_COMPATIBLE
configuration parameter set, then the Busy Functionality is
not available. These UARTs will never generate the Busy
detect indication interrupt, and therefore don't need
handling for it.

This creates a small optimization for the DW_apb_uarts
configured without the busy functionality, but more
importantly, it removes the small but real risk of hitting
potential issues caused by busy functionality handling when
no busy functionality exist.
