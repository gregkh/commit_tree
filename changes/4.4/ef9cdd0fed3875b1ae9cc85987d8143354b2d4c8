switchdev: bridge: Pass ageing time as clock_t instead of jiffies

The bridge's ageing time is offloaded to hardware when:
	1) A port joins a bridge
	2) The ageing time of the bridge is changed

In the first case the ageing time is offloaded as jiffies, but in the
second case it's offloaded as clock_t, which is what existing switchdev
drivers expect to receive.
