serial: don't register CIR serial ports

CIR type serial ports aren't real serial ports.

This is just a way to prevent legacy 8250 serial
driver from probing and eventually binding some
resources.

Since in current state such ports aren't providing
any real functionality and it is not possible
to change their type via setserial/ioctl(TIOCSSERIAL)
(due to UPF_FIXED_PORT flag set on them)
it is simpler and cleaner to not register them at all
with serial core.

Print a short message in this case so it is known
to user what has happened.

This way checks for PORT_8250_CIR in serial port
callbacks can be removed too, since they won't
ever be called.
