ACPI: Adding DMA Attribute APIs for ACPI Device

Adding acpi_get_dma_attr() to query DMA attributes of ACPI devices.
It returns the enum dev_dma_attr, which communicates DMA information
more clearly. This API replaces the acpi_check_dma(), which will be
removed in subsequent patch.

This patch also provides a convenient function, acpi_dma_supported(),
to check DMA support of the specified ACPI device.
