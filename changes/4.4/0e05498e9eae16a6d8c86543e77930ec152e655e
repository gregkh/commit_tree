tipc: make link implementation independent from struct tipc_bearer

In reality, the link implementation is already independent from
struct tipc_bearer, in that it doesn't store any reference to it.
However, we still pass on a pointer to a bearer instance in the
function tipc_link_create(), just to have it extract some
initialization information from it.

I later commits, we need to create instances of tipc_link without
having any associated struct tipc_bearer. To facilitate this, we
want to extract the initialization data already in the creator
function in node.c, before calling tipc_link_create(), and pass
this info on as individual parameters in the call.

This commit introduces this change.
