ALSA: hda - apply SKL display power request/release patch to BXT

For SKL, only the HDMI codec is in the display power well while the
HD-A controller isn't. So the codec flag 'link_power_control' is
set to request/release the display power via bus link_power ops.
For BXT, the power well design is the same as SKL, so the patch
should be applied to BXT too.
