Revert "USB: qcserial/option: make AT URCs work for Sierra Wireless MC73xx"

This reverts commit d80c0d14183516f184a5ac88e11008ee4c7d2a2e
(excluding the change to MAX_BL_NUM, which has since been removed).

The qcserial driver now enables the SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE request
so that AT URCs will work. Move these devices back to the qcserial
driver, which is used for other devices in this series that follow
the same layout.
