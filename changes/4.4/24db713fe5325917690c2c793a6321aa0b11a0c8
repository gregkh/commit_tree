staging: wilc1000: remove the macro WILC_ERRORREPORT

This patch removes the macro WILC_ERRORREPORT which is not used
anymore by replacing it with the plain statements.

The compiler complains the build warnings in some functions for WILC_CATCH and
ERRORHANDLER as unused definitions. So, this patch also removes WILC_CATCH and
ERRORHANDLER from some of functions.
