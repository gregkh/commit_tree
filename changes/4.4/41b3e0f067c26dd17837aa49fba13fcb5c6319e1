soc: mediatek: Fix random hang up issue while kernel init

In kernel late init, it turns off all unused clocks, which
needs to access subsystem registers such as VENC and VENC_LT.

Accessing MT8173 VENC registers needs two top clocks, mm_sel and
venc_sel. Accessing VENC_LT registers needs mm_sel and venclt_sel.
So we need to keep these clocks on before accessing their registers.

This patch keeps venc_sel / venclt_sel clock on when
VENC / VENC_LT's power is on, to prevent system hang up while
accessing its registeres.
