drm/amd/scheduler: don't oops on failure to load

In two places amdgpu tries to tear down something it hasn't
initalised when failing. This is what happens when you
enable experimental support on topaz which then fails in
ring init.

This patch allows it to fail cleanly.

agd: Split out from from the original patch since the
scheduler is a driver independent.
