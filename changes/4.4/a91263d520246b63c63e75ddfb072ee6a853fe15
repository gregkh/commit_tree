ebpf: migrate bpf_prog's flags to bitfield

As we need to add further flags to the bpf_prog structure, lets migrate
both bools to a bitfield representation. The size of the base structure
(excluding insns) remains unchanged at 40 bytes.

Add also tags for the kmemchecker, so that it doesn't throw false
positives. Even in case gcc would generate suboptimal code, it's not
being accessed in performance critical paths.
