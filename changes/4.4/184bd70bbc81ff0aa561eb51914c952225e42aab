serial: imx: configure proper DMA burst sizes

Triggering the DMA engine for every byte is horribly inefficient.
Also it doesn't allow to use the aging timer for the RX FIFO as this
requires the DMA engine to leave one byte remaining in the FIFO when
doing a normal burst transfer.

Adjust watermark levels so that the DMA engine can do at least 8 byte
burst transfers. This is a conservative value, as the both TX and RX
FIFOs are able to contain 32 bytes.
