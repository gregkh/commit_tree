drm/omap: fix fbdev pix format to support all platforms

omap_fbdev always creates a framebuffer with ARGB8888 pixel format. On
OMAP3 we have VIDEO1 overlay that does not support ARGB8888, and on
OMAP2 none of the overlays support ARGB888.

This patch changes the omap_fbdev's fb to XRGB8888, which is supported
by all platforms.
