pNFS/flexfiles: Add support for FF_FLAGS_NO_IO_THRU_MDS

For loosely coupled pNFS/flexfiles systems, there is often no advantage
at all in going through the MDS for I/O, since the MDS is subject to
the same limitations as all other clients when talking to DSes. If a
DS is unresponsive, I/O through the MDS will fail.

For such systems, the only scalable solution is to have the pNFS clients
retry doing pNFS, and so the protocol now provides a flag that allows
the pNFS server to signal this.

If LAYOUTGET returns FF_FLAGS_NO_IO_THRU_MDS, then we should assume that
the MDS wants the client to retry using these devices, even if they were
previously marked as being unavailable. To do so, we add a helper,
ff_layout_mark_devices_valid() that will be called from layoutget.
