ksm: don't fail stable tree lookups if walking over stale stable_nodes

The stable_nodes can become stale at any time if the underlying pages gets
freed.  The stable_node gets collected and removed from the stable rbtree
if that is detected during the rbtree lookups.

Don't fail the lookup if running into stale stable_nodes, just restart the
lookup after collecting the stale stable_nodes.  Otherwise the CPU spent
in the preparation stage is wasted and the lookup must be repeated at the
next loop potentially failing a second time in a second stale stable_node.

If we don't prune aggressively we delay the merging of the unstable node
candidates and at the same time we delay the freeing of the stale
stable_nodes.  Keeping stale stable_nodes around wastes memory and it
can't provide any benefit.
