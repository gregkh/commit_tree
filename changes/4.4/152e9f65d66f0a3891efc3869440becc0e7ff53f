KVM: s390: fix wrong lookup of VCPUs by array index

For now, VCPUs were always created sequentially with incrementing
VCPU ids. Therefore, the index in the VCPUs array matched the id.

As sequential creation might change with cpu hotplug, let's use
the correct lookup function to find a VCPU by id, not array index.

Let's also use kvm_lookup_vcpu() for validation of the sending VCPU
on external call injection.
