mtd: nand: vf610_nfc: Freescale NFC for VF610, MPC5125 and others

This driver supports Freescale NFC (NAND flash controller) found on
Vybrid (VF610), MPC5125, MCF54418 and Kinetis K70. The driver has
been tested using 8-bit and 16-bit NAND interface on the ARM based
Vybrid SoC VF500 and VF610 platform.
parameter page reading.

Limitations:
- Untested on MPC5125 and M54418.
- DMA and pipelining not used.
- 2K pages or less.
- No chip select, one NAND chip per controller.
- No hardware ECC.

Some paths have been hand-optimized and evaluated by measurements
made using mtd_speedtest.ko on a 100MB MTD partition.

rel = using readl_relaxed/writel_relaxed in optimized paths
opt = hand-optimized by combining multiple accesses into one read/write

The measurements have not been statistically verfied, hence use them
with care. The author came to the conclusion that using the relaxed
variants of readl/writel are not worth the additional code.
