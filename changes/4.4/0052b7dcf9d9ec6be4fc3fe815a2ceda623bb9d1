ALSA: pcm: remove structure member of 'struct snd_pcm_hwptr_log *' type because this structure had been removed

This structure was added by 4d96eb255c53 ('ALSA: pcm_lib - add possibility
to log last 10 DMA ring buffer positions') to store PCM pointers
information of latest 10 pointer movements (=XRUN_LOG_CNT). When
CONFIG_SND_PCM_XRUN_DEBUG is configured, 'struct snd_pcm_runtime' has
'hwptr_log' member with a pointer to the structure. When calling
xrun_log() in pcm_lib.c, the structure was allocated to the pointer.
When calling snd_pcm_detach_substream() in pcm.c, the allocated pointer
is released.

In f5914908a5b7 ('ALSA: pcm: Replace PCM hwptr tracking with tracepoints'),
the pointer logging is replaced with using Linux Kernel Tracepoints. The
structure was also removed, while it's just declared. The member and kfree
still remains.

This commit removes the member and related codes. I think this was
overlooked because it brings no errors/warnings to C compilers.
