nfsd: fix clid_inuse on mount with security change

In bakeathon testing Solaris client was getting CLID_INUSE error when
doing a krb5 mount soon after an auth_sys mount, or vice versa.

That's not really necessary since in this case the old client doesn't
have any state any more:

	http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7530#page-103

	"when the server gets a SETCLIENTID for a client ID that
	currently has no state, or it has state but the lease has
	expired, rather than returning NFS4ERR_CLID_INUSE, the server
	MUST allow the SETCLIENTID and confirm the new client ID if
	followed by the appropriate SETCLIENTID_CONFIRM."

This doesn't fix the problem completely since our client_has_state()
check counts openowners left around to handle close replays, which we
should probably just remove in this case.
