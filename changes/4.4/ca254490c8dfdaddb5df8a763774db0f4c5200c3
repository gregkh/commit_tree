net: Add VRF support to IPv6 stack

As with IPv4 support for VRFs added to IPv6 stack by replacing hardcoded
table ids with possibly device specific ones and manipulating the oif in
the flowi6. The flow flags are used to skip oif compare in nexthop lookups
if the device is enslaved to a VRF via the L3 master device.
