switchdev: introduce transaction item queue for attr_set and obj_add

Now, the memory allocation in prepare/commit state is done separatelly
in each driver (rocker). Introduce the similar mechanism in generic
switchdev code, in form of queue. That can be used not only for memory
allocations, but also for different items. Abort item destruction
is handled as well.
