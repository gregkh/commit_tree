clk: tegra: Modify tegra_audio_clk_init to accept more plls

tegra_audio_clk_init was written expecting a single PLL to be
passed in directly. Change this to accept an array which will
allow for supporting multiple plls and specifying specific data
about them, like their parent, which may change over time.
