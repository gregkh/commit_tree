qcom: clk: Make qcom_cc_probe() fully devm safe

Some APIs in qcom_cc_probe() don't have a devm counterpart, so we
have to use the calling device's platform data to pass pointers
to the remove path. Let's use devm_add_action() instead, so that
the remove path doesn't need to do anything, allowing us to
remove qcom_cc_remove() entirely.
