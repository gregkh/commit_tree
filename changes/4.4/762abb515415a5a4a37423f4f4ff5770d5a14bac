lib/vsprintf.c: also improve sanity check in bstr_printf()

Quoting from 2aa2f9e21e4e ("lib/vsprintf.c: improve sanity check in
vsnprintf()"):

    On 64 bit, size may very well be huge even if bit 31 happens to be 0.
    Somehow it doesn't feel right that one can pass a 5 GiB buffer but not a
    3 GiB one.  So cap at INT_MAX as was probably the intention all along.
    This is also the made-up value passed by sprintf and vsprintf.

I should have seen this copy-pasted instance back then, but let's just
do it now.
