i40e: Fix multiple link up messages

This patch addresses an issue where multiple link up messages can be logged
resulting from aq link status timing when link properties are changed (fc,
speed, etc.); solved by using a single function to handle status printing
and adding a mechanism to track whether link state (up or down) has
actually changed.
