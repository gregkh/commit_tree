rcu_sync: Add CONFIG_PROVE_RCU checks

This commit validates that the caller of rcu_sync_is_idle() holds the
corresponding type of RCU read-side lock, but only in kernels built
with CONFIG_PROVE_RCU=y.  This validation is carried out via a new
rcu_sync_ops->held() method that is checked within rcu_sync_is_idle().

Note that although this does add code to the fast path, it only does so
in kernels built with CONFIG_PROVE_RCU=y.
