backlight: pwm: Reject legacy PWM request for device defined in DT

Platform PWM backlight data provided by board's device tree should be
complete enough to successfully request a pwm device using pwm_get()
API. This change fixes a bug, when an arbitrary (first found) PWM is
connected to a "pwm-backlight" compatible device, when explicit PWM
device reference is not given.

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/backlight/pwm-backlight.txt
already describes "pwms" as a required property, instead of blind
selection of a potentially wrong PWM reject legacy PWM device
registration request, leave legacy API only for non-dt cases.

Based on initial implementation done by Dmitry Eremin-Solenikov.
