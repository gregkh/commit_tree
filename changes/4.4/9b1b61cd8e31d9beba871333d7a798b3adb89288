ARM: OMAP2+: remove custom abort handler for t410

This is not needed anymore. Handling a potentially pending imprecise external
abort left behind by the bootloader is now done in a slightly safer way inside
the common ARM startup code.

With the recent changes to abort handling, this issue got fixed by 57df53808534
("ARM: OMAP2+: Fix imprecise external abort caused by bogus SRAM init").
