x86/fpu: Remove 'xfeature_nr'

xfeature_nr ended up being initialized too late for me to
use it in the "xsave size sanity check" patch which is
later in the series.  I tried to move around its initialization
but realized that it was just as easy to get rid of it.

We only have 9 XFEATURES.  Instead of dynamically calculating
and storing the last feature, just use the compile-time max:
XFEATURES_NR_MAX.  Note that even with 'xfeatures_nr' we can
had "holes" in the xfeatures_mask that we had to deal with.

We also change a 'leaf' variable to be a plain 'i'.  Although
it is used to grab a cpuid leaf in this one loop, all of the
other loops just use an 'i' and I find it much more obvious
to keep the naming consistent across all the similar loops.
