arm64: remove redundant FRAME_POINTER kconfig option and force to select it

FRAME_POINTER is defined in lib/Kconfig.debug, it is unnecessary to redefine it
in arch/arm64/Kconfig.debug.

ARM64 depends on frame pointer to get correct stack trace (also selecting
ARCH_WANT_FRAME_POINTERS). However, the lib/Kconfig.debug definition allows
such option to be disabled. This patch forces FRAME_POINTER always on on arm64.
