ipvs: Store ipvs not net in struct ip_vs_service

In practice struct netns_ipvs is as meaningful as struct net and more
useful as it holds the ipvs specific data.  So store a pointer to
struct netns_ipvs.

Update the accesses of param->net to access param->ipvs->net instead.

In functions where we are searching for an svc and filtering by net
filter by ipvs instead.
