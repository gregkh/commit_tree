mm, page_alloc: use masks and shifts when converting GFP flags to migrate types

This patch redefines which GFP bits are used for specifying mobility and
the order of the migrate types.  Once redefined it's possible to convert
GFP flags to a migrate type with a simple mask and shift.  The only
downside is that readers of OOM kill messages and allocation failures may
have been used to the existing values but scripts/gfp-translate will help.
