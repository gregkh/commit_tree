nilfs2: add a tracepoint for transaction events

This patch adds a tracepoint for transaction events of nilfs.  With the
tracepoint, these events can be tracked: begin, abort, commit, trylock,
lock, and unlock.  Basically, these events have corresponding functions
e.g.  begin event corresponds nilfs_transaction_begin().  The unlock event
is an exception.  It corresponds to the iteration in
nilfs_transaction_lock().

Only one tracepoint is introcued: nilfs2_transaction_transition.  The
above events are distinguished with newly introduced enum.  With this
tracepoint, we can analyse a critical section of segment constructoin.

Sample output by tpoint of perf-tools:
              cp-4457  [000] ...1    63.266220: nilfs2_transaction_transition: sb = ffff8802112b8800 ti = ffff8800bf5ccc58 count = 1 flags = 9 state = BEGIN
              cp-4457  [000] ...1    63.266221: nilfs2_transaction_transition: sb = ffff8802112b8800 ti = ffff8800bf5ccc58 count = 0 flags = 9 state = COMMIT
              cp-4457  [000] ...1    63.266221: nilfs2_transaction_transition: sb = ffff8802112b8800 ti = ffff8800bf5ccc58 count = 0 flags = 9 state = COMMIT

        segctord-4371  [001] ...1   132.376847: nilfs2_transaction_transition: sb = ffff8802112b8800 ti = ffff8800b889bdf8 count = 0 flags = 10 state = TRYLOCK

This patch also does trivial cleaning of comma usage in collection stage
transition event for consistent coding style.
