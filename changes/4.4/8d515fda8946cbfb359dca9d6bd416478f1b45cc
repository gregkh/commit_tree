HID: wacom: Report full pressure range for Intuos, Cintiq 13HD Touch

The new Intuos tablets added in eda01da and the Cintiq 13HD Touch added
in b4bf212 are capable of reporting 2048 levels of pressure. Although the
kernel reports the correct range to userspace, an oversight has resulted
in the driver ingoring the 11th pressure bit and only sending pressures
of 0 through 1023.

We could fix this issue by expanding the type check to include these
devices, but it makes much more sense to just have the driver look at
the device's maximum pressure when determining if it should read the
11th bit.
