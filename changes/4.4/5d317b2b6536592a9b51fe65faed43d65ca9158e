mm: hugetlb: proc: add HugetlbPages field to /proc/PID/status

Currently there's no easy way to get per-process usage of hugetlb pages,
which is inconvenient because userspace applications which use hugetlb
typically want to control their processes on the basis of how much memory
(including hugetlb) they use.  So this patch simply provides easy access
to the info via /proc/PID/status.
