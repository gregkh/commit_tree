ALSA: hda - Fix lost 4k BDL boundary workaround

During the migration to HDA core code, we lost the workaround for 4k
BDL boundary.  The flag exists in the new hdac_bus, but it's never
set.  This resulted in the sudden sound stall on some controllers that
require this workaround like Creative Recon3D.

This patch fixes the issue by setting the flag for such controllers
properly.
