net: mvneta: Statically assign queues to CPUs

Since the switch to per-CPU interrupts, we lost the ability to set which
CPU was going to receive our RX interrupt, which was now only the CPU on
which the mvneta_open function was run.

We can now assign our queues to their respective CPUs, and make sure only
this CPU is going to handle our traffic.

This also paves the road to be able to change that at runtime, and later on
to support RSS.
