USB: rewrite isd200_init_info for readability

Previously, Coccinelle would issue the following false positive:

isd200.c:1478:14-18: ERROR: reference preceded by free on line 1472

This change rewrites the isd200_init_info function to have more explicit
execution pathways to make it easier for scripts and humans to parse.
