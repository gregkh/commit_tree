recordmcount: x86: Assign a meaningful value to rel_type_nop

Although, the default value of rel_type_nop is zero, and the value
of R_386_NONE/R_X86_64_NONE is zero too, but it should be assigned
a meaningful value explicitly, otherwise it looks confused.

Assign R_386_NONE to rel_type_nop for 386, assign R_X86_64_NONE
to rel_type_nop for x86_64.
