ntp/pps: use timespec64 for hardpps()

There is only one user of the hardpps function in the kernel, so
it makes sense to atomically change it over to using 64-bit
timestamps for y2038 safety. In the hardpps implementation,
we also need to change the pps_normtime structure, which is
similar to struct timespec and also requires a 64-bit
seconds portion.

This introduces two temporary variables in pps_kc_event() to
do the conversion, they will be removed again in the next step,
which seemed preferable to having a larger patch changing it
all at the same time.
