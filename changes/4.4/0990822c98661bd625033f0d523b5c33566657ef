VFIO: platform: reset: AMD xgbe reset module

This patch introduces a module that registers and implements a low-level
reset function for the AMD XGBE device.

it performs the following actions:
- reset the PHY
- disable auto-negotiation
- disable & clear auto-negotiation IRQ
- soft-reset the MAC

Those tiny pieces of code are inherited from the native xgbe driver.
