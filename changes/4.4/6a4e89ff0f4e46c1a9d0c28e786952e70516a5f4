ALSA: firewire-lib: add a member of frame_multiplier instead of double_pcm_frames

In future commit, interface between data block processing layer and packet
stream processing layer is defined. These two layers communicate the
number of data blocks and the number of PCM frames.

The data block processing layer has a responsibility for calculating the
number of PCM frames. Therefore, 'dual wire' of Dice quirk should be
handled in data block processing layer.

This commit adds a member of 'frame_multiplier'. This member represents
the ratio of the number of PCM frames against the number of data blocks.
Usually, the value of this member is 1, while it's 2 in Dice's 'dual wire'.
