thermal: fix thermal_zone_bind_cooling_device prototype

When the prototype for thermal_zone_bind_cooling_device
changed, the static inline wrapper function was left alone,
which in theory can cause build warnings:

I have seen this error in the past:
drivers/thermal/db8500_thermal.c: In function 'db8500_cdev_bind':
drivers/thermal/db8500_thermal.c:78:9: error: too many arguments to function 'thermal_zone_bind_cooling_device'
   ret = thermal_zone_bind_cooling_device(thermal, i, cdev,

while this one no longer shows up, there is no doubt that
the prototype is still wrong, so let's just fix it anyway.
