tty: Combine SIGTTOU/SIGTTIN handling

The job_control() check in n_tty_read() has nearly identical purpose
and results as tty_check_change(). Both functions' purpose is to
determine if the current task's pgrp is the foreground pgrp for the tty,
and if not, to signal the current pgrp.

Introduce __tty_check_change() which takes the signal to send
and performs the shared operations for job control() and
tty_check_change().
