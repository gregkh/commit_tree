net: sctp: avoid incorrect time_t use

We want to avoid using time_t in the kernel because of the y2038
overflow problem. The use in sctp is not for storing seconds at
all, but instead uses microseconds and is passed as 32-bit
on all machines.

This patch changes the type to u32, which better fits the use.
