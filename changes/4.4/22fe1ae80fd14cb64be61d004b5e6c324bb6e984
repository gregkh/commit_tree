cxlflash: Fix potential oops following LUN removal

When a LUN is removed, the sdev that is associated with the LUN
remains intact until its reference count drops to 0. In order
to prevent an sdev from being removed while a context is still
associated with it, obtain an additional reference per-context
for each LUN attached to the context.

This resolves a potential Oops in the release handler when a
dealing with a LUN that has already been removed.
