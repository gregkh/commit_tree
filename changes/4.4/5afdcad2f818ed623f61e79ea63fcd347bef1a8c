staging: comedi: comedi_test: limit maximum convert_arg

When testing the parameters for setting up an asynchronous command on
the AI subdevice, limit the maximum conversion period
(`cmd->convert_arg`) so that the number of conversions in a scan
(`cmd->scan_end_arg`, same as `cmd->chanlist_len`) multiplied by the
conversion period fits within an `unsigned int`, as that is used to
limit the minimum scan period (`cmd->scan_begin_arg`).

Also ensure rounding of the conversion period and scan period to the
nearest microsecond both fit in an `unsigned int`.  Do all this in stage
4 ("fix up any arguments") of the command testing.
