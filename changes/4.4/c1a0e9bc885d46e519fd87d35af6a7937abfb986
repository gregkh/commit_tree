MIPS: Allow compact branch policy to be changed

When debugging it can be helpful to change the policy for compiler use
of MIPSr6 compact branches, in order to rule out or home in on their
involvement in bugs. Allow the GCC -mcompact-branches= flag to be set
via Kconfig under the "Kernel hacking" menu.
