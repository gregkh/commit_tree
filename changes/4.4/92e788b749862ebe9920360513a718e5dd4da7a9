arm64: restore bogomips information in /proc/cpuinfo

As previously reported, some userspace applications depend on bogomips
showed by /proc/cpuinfo. Although there is much less legacy impact on
aarch64 than arm, it does break libvirt.

This patch reverts commit 326b16db9f69 ("arm64: delay: don't bother
reporting bogomips in /proc/cpuinfo"), but with some tweak due to
context change and without the pr_info().
