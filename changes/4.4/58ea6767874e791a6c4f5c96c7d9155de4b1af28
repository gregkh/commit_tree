KVM: x86: Move TSC scaling logic out of call-back adjust_tsc_offset()

For both VMX and SVM, if the 2nd argument of call-back
adjust_tsc_offset() is the host TSC, then adjust_tsc_offset() will scale
it first. This patch moves this common TSC scaling logic to its caller
adjust_tsc_offset_host() and rename the call-back adjust_tsc_offset() to
adjust_tsc_offset_guest().
