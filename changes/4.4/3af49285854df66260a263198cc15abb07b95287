xfs: add ->pfn_mkwrite support for DAX

->pfn_mkwrite support is needed so that when a page with allocated
backing store takes a write fault we can check that the fault has
not raced with a truncate and is pointing to a region beyond the
current end of file.

This also allows us to update the timestamp on the inode, too, which
fixes a generic/080 failure.
