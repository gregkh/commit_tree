ASoC: topology: ABI - Add PCM Support and bump ABI version to 4

The struct snd_soc_tplg_pcm_dai is renamed to snd_soc_tplg_pcm.
This struct will now be used to handle data related to PCMs
(FE DAI & DAI links). It's not for BE, because BE DAI mappings will be
provided by ACPI/FDT data.

Remove the unused struct snd_soc_tplg_pcm_cfg_caps. We are using
snd_soc_tplg_stream and snd_soc_stream_caps instead.

Bump ABI version to 4.
