net: fix __netdev_update_features return on ndo_set_features failure

If ndo_set_features fails __netdev_update_features() will return -1 but
this is wrong because it is expected to return 0 if no features were
changed (see netdev_update_features()), which will cause a netdev
notifier to be called without any actual changes. Fix this by returning
0 if ndo_set_features fails.
