scsi: use host wide tags by default

This patch changes the !blk-mq path to the same defaults as the blk-mq
I/O path by always enabling block tagging, and always using host wide
tags.  We've had blk-mq available for a few releases so bugs with
this mode should have been ironed out, and this ensures we get better
coverage of over tagging setup over different configs.
