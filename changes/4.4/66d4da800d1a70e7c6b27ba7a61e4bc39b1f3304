staging: comedi: comedi_test: simplify time since last AI scan

The private data structure `struct waveform_private` currently uses
member `last` to remember the time of the last timer interrupt, and the
member `usec_remainder` to keep track of how far into a simulated scan
the interrupt occurred.  Replace these with a single new member
`ai_last_scan_time` that records the time of the last scan.  This
simplifies the calculation of the number of scans to simulate in the
timer routine, `waveform_ai_interrupt()`.
