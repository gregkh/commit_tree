skip match_mddev_units check for special roles

match_mddev_units is used to check whether 2 RAID arrays share
same disk(s). Arrays that share disk(s) will not do resync at the
same time for better performance (fewer HDD seek). However, this
check should not apply to Spare, Faulty, and Journal disks, as
they do not paticipate in resync.

In this patch, match_mddev_units skips check for disks with flag
"Faulty" or "Journal" or raid_disk < 0.
