mtd: blktrans: fix multiplication overflow

In drivers/mtd/mtd_blkdevs.c:
406	set_capacity(gd, (new->size * tr->blksize) >> 9);
The type of new->size is unsigned long and the type of tr->blksize is int,
the result of 'new->size * tr->blksize' may exceed ULONG_MAX on 32bit
machines.

I use nand chip MT29F32G08CBADBWP which is 4GB and the parameters passed
to kernel is 'mtdparts=gpmi-nand:-(user)', the whole nand chip will be
treated as a 4GB mtd partition. new->size is 0x800000 and tr->blksize is
0x200, 'new->size * tr->blksize' however is 0. This is what we do not want
to see.

Using type cast u64 to fix the multiplication overflow issue.
