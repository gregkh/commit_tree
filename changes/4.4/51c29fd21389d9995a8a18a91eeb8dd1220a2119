ALSA: firewire-lib: rename parameter setting function for AM824 with FDF field

The value of FDF field in CIP header is protocol-dependent. Thus, it's
better to allow data block processing layer to decide the value in any
timing.

In AM824 data format, the value of FDF field in CIP header indicates
N-flag and Nominal Sampling Frequency Code (sfc). The N-flag is for
switching 'Clock-based rate control mode' and 'Command-based rate control
mode'. In our implementation, 'Clock-based rate control mode' is just
supported. Therefore, When sampling transfer frequency is decided, then
the FDF can be set.

This commit replaces 'amdtp_stream_set_parameters' with
'amdtp_am824_set_parameters' to set the FDF. This is the same timing
to decide the ration between the number of data blocks and the number of
PCM frames.
