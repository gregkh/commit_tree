staging: comedi: quatech_daqp_cs: don't use interrupts for ai (*insn_read)

The comedi (*insn_read) functions are supposed to do simple one-shot
reading of an analog input channel. Currently this driver enables
interrupts and uses wait_for_completion_interruptible() to allow the
interrupt routine to let the analog input (*insn_read) know that
the end-of-conversion has occured.

Simplify the function by using the comedi_timeout() helper to check
the aux status register to see when the conversion is finished.
