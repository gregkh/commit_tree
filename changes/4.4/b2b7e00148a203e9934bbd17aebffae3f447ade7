null_blk: register as a LightNVM device

Add support for registering as a LightNVM device. This allows us to
evaluate the performance of the LightNVM subsystem.

In /drivers/Makefile, LightNVM is moved above block device drivers
to make sure that the LightNVM media managers have been initialized
before drivers under /drivers/block are initialized.
