f2fs: support synchronous gc in ioctl

This patch drops in batches gc triggered through ioctl, since user
can easily control the gc by designing the loop around the ->ioctl.

We support synchronous gc by forcing using FG_GC in f2fs_gc, so with
it, user can make sure that in this round all blocks gced were
persistent in the device until ioctl returned.
