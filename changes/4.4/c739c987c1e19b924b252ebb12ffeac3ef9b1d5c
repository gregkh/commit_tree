staging: wlan-ng remove redundant conditional

We exit the above loop either if curroff >= (HFA384x_PDA_LEN_MAX / 2 - 1)
or if we found the END marker in the element beyond the current one. The
first case is checked for in the preceding if statement, therefore the
second if statement is redundant and can be removed.
