iio: percolate error if event fd fails

This makes the error from iio_event_getfd() percolate up
to userspace properly so we can know for sure there is no
events on this device (-ENODEV returned). Before this patch
we would bail out looking for the unsupported events on the
erroneous (negative) file descriptor.
