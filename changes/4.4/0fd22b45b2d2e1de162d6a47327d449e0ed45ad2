raid5-cache: fix a user-after-free bug

r5l_compress_stripe_end_list() can free an io_unit. This breaks the
assumption only reclaimer can free io_unit. We can add a reference count
based io_unit free, but since only reclaim can wait io_unit becoming to
STRIPE_END state, we use a simple global wait queue here.
