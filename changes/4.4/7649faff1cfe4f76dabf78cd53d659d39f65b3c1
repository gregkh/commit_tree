Bluetooth: Remove useless rx_lock spinlock

rx_lock spinlock is only used in hci_uart_tty_receive() which is the
receive_buf ldisc callback.

hci_uart_tty_receive() is protected from re-entrance by its only
caller (flush_to_ldisc() in drivers/tty/tty_buffer.c) which held a
mutex (buf->lock) for this section.
This lock allows "safe use of the line discipline's receive_buf()
method by excluding the buffer work and any pending flush from using
the flip buffer." (comments from tty_buffer_lock_exclusive() in
drivers/tty/tty_buffer.c)

So, no need to double protect this resource with rx_lock.
