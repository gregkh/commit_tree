kvm/x86: Hyper-V HV_X64_MSR_VP_RUNTIME support

HV_X64_MSR_VP_RUNTIME msr used by guest to get
"the time the virtual processor consumes running guest code,
and the time the associated logical processor spends running
hypervisor code on behalf of that guest."

Calculation of this time is performed by task_cputime_adjusted()
for vcpu task.

Necessary to support loading of winhv.sys in guest, which in turn is
required to support Windows VMBus.
