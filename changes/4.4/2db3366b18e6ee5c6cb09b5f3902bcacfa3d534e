drm/i915: fix FBC for cases where crtc->base.y is non-zero

I only tested this on BDW and SKL, but since the register description
is the same ever since gen4, let's assume that all gens take the same
register format. If that's not true, then hopefully someone will
bisect a bug to this patch and we'll fix it.

Notice that the wrong fence offset register just means that the
hardware tracking will be wrong.

Testcases:
 - igt/kms_frontbuffer_tracking/fbc-1p-primscrn-pri-shrfb-draw-mmap-gtt
 - igt/kms_frontbuffer_tracking/fbc-2p-primscrn-pri-shrfb-draw-mmap-gtt

v2:
  - Add intel_crtc->adjusted_{x,y} so this code can work independently
    of intel_gen4_compute_page_offset(). (Ville).
  - This version also works on SKL.
