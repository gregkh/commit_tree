mmc: sdhci-pltfm: enable interrupt mode to detect card for ls1021a

Enable interrupt mode to detect card instead of polling mode for
ls1021a by removing the quirk SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION.
This could improve data transferring performance and avoid the call
trace caused by polling card status sometime.
