HID: core: Avoid uninitialized buffer access

hid_connect adds various strings to the buffer but they're all
conditional. You can find circumstances where nothing would be written
to it but the kernel will still print the supposedly empty buffer with
printk. This leads to corruption on the console/in the logs.

Ensure buf is initialized to an empty string.
