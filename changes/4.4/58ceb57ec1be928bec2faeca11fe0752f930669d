ASoC: pxa: pxa-pcm-lib: switch over to snd-soc-dmaengine-pcm

This patch removes the old PXA DMA API usage and switches over to
generic functions provided by snd-soc-dmaengine-pcm.

More cleanups may be done on top of this, and some function stubs can
now be removed completetly. However, the intention here was to keep
the transition as small as possible.

This was tested on the mioa701 pxa27x board.
