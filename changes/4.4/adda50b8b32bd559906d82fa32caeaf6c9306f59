drm/i915/skl: Don't clear all watermarks when updating. (v2)

Clearing the watermarks for all pipes/planes when updating the
watermarks for a single CRTC change seems like the wrong thing to
do here. As is, this code will ony update any pipe/plane watermarks
that need updating and leave the remaining set to zero.  Later, the
watermark checks in check_wm_state() will flag these zero'd out pipe/plane
watermarks and throw errors.

By clearing only the watermark values associated with the specific crtc
the other watermark values may remain unchanged.

v2: Make sure all the dirty flags are cleared. Damien
    Clear all values assoicated with crtc/pipe being updated.  Damien
