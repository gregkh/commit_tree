tracing: Add a method to pass in trace_array descriptor to option files

In preparation of having the multi buffer instances having their own trace
option flags, the trace option files needs a way to not only pass in the
flag they represent, but also the trace_array descriptor.

A new field is added to the trace_array descriptor called trace_flags_index,
which is a 32 byte character array representing a bit. This array is simply
filled with the index of the array, where

  index_array[n] = n;

Then the address of this array is passed to the file callbacks instead of
the index of the flag index. Then to retrieve both the flag index and the
trace_array descriptor:

  data is the passed in argument.

  index = *(unsigned char *)data;

  data -= index;

  /* Now data points to the address of the array in the trace_array */

  tr = container_of(data, struct trace_array, trace_flags_index);
