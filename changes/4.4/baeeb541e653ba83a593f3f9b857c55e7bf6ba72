ARM: dts: vf610twr: add NAND flash controller peripherial

This adds the NAND flash controller (NFC) peripherial. The driver
supports the SLC NAND chips found on Freescale's Vybrid Tower System
Module. The Micron NAND chip on the module needs 4-bit ECC per 512
byte page. Use 24-bit ECC per 2k page, which is supported by the
driver.
