ipv6: fix crash on ICMPv6 redirects with prohibited/blackholed source

There are other error values besides ip6_null_entry that can be returned by
ip6_route_redirect(): fib6_rule_action() can also result in
ip6_blk_hole_entry and ip6_prohibit_entry if such ip rules are installed.

Only checking for ip6_null_entry in rt6_do_redirect() causes ip6_ins_rt()
to be called with rt->rt6i_table == NULL in these cases, making the kernel
crash.
