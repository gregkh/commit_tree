PCI: Wait 1 second between disabling VFs and clearing NumVFs

Per sec 3.3.3.1 of the SR-IOV spec, r1.1, we must allow 1.0s after clearing
VF Enable before reading any field in the SR-IOV Extended Capability.

Wait 1 second before calling pci_iov_set_numvfs(), which reads
PCI_SRIOV_VF_OFFSET and PCI_SRIOV_VF_STRIDE after it sets PCI_SRIOV_NUM_VF.
