advansys: fix big-endian builds

Building the advansys driver in a big-endian configuration such as
ARM allmodconfig shows a warning:

 drivers/scsi/advansys.c: In function 'adv_build_req':
 include/uapi/linux/byteorder/big_endian.h:32:26: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Woverflow]
  #define __cpu_to_le32(x) ((__force __le32)__swab32((x)))
 drivers/scsi/advansys.c:7806:22: note: in expansion of macro 'cpu_to_le32'
   scsiqp->sense_len = cpu_to_le32(SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE);

It turns out that the commit that introduced this used the cpu_to_le32()
incorrectly on an 8-bit field, which results in the sense_len to always
be set to zero, as the SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE value gets moved to upper
byte of the 32-bit intermediate.

This removes the cpu_to_le32() call to restore the original version.

I found this only by looking at the compiler output and have not done a
full review for possible further endianess bugs in the same driver.
