staging: comedi: pcl816: remove #if 0'ed out code

Remove the #if 0'ed out code that would initialize an analog output
subdevice.

The hardware does not normally support an analog output subdevice.
Analog outputs are only supported with additional "piggyback" modules.
Support for these modules is not included in the driver.
