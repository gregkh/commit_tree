s390/nmi: remove casts

Remove all the casts to and from the machine check interruption code.
This patch changes struct mci to a union, which contains an anonymous
structure with the already known bits and in addition an unsigned
long field, which contains the raw machine check interruption code.

This allows to simply assign and decoce the interruption code value
without the need for all those casts we had all the time.
