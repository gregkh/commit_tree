IB/mlx4: Support the new memory registration API

Support the new memory registration API by allocating a
private page list array in mlx4_ib_mr and populate it when
mlx4_ib_map_mr_sg is invoked. Also, support IB_WR_REG_MR
by setting the exact WQE as IB_WR_FAST_REG_MR, just take the
needed information from different places:
- page_size, iova, length, access flags (ib_mr)
- page array (mlx4_ib_mr)
- key (ib_reg_wr)

The IB_WR_FAST_REG_MR handlers will be removed later when
all the ULPs will be converted.
