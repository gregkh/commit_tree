drm/i915: Drop the broken cursor base==0 special casing

The cursor code tries to treat base==0 to mean disabled. That fails
when the cursor bo gets bound at ggtt offset 0, and the user is left
looking at an invisible cursor.

We lose the disabled->disabled optimization, but that seems like
something better handled at a slightly higher level.
