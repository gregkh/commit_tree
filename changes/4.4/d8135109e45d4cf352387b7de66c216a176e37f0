drm/i915/bxt: fix RC6 residency time calculation

The RC6 residency time unit is 833.33ns on BXT according to the
specification, so update the calculation accordingly. Use the same way
as CHV/VLV to divide by the corresponding frequency, as I think this is
the more natural unit for what the HW does internally.

v2:
- add missing IS_BROXTON check (Ville)
