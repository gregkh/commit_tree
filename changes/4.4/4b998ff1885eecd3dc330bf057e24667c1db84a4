arm64: Delay cpuinfo_store_boot_cpu

At the moment the boot CPU stores the cpuinfo long before the
PERCPU areas are initialised by the kernel. This could be problematic
as the non-boot CPU data structures might get copied with the data
from the boot CPU, giving us no chance to detect if a particular CPU
updated its cpuinfo. This patch delays the boot cpu store to
smp_prepare_boot_cpu().

Also kills the setup_processor() which no longer does meaningful
work.
