mwifiex: correction in USB8997 chipset's product ID

For 8897 chipset, mwifiex_usb unnecessarily used to
come into picture when wlan is supposed to be used
via PCIe interface and USB interface is for
bluetooth.

This problem has been resolved for newer chipset by
having separate USB product ids for USB-USB8997 and
PCIe-USB8997 chipset variants. This patch ensures to
use wlan specific product id.
