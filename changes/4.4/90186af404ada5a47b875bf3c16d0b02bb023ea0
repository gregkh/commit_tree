r8152: fix lockup when runtime PM is enabled

When an interface is brought up which was previously suspended (via
runtime PM), it would hang. This happens because napi_disable is called
before napi_enable.

Solve this by avoiding napi_enable in the resume during open function
(netif_running is true when open is called, IFF_UP is set after a
successful open; netif_running is false when close is called, but IFF_UP
is then still set).

While at it, remove WORK_ENABLE check from rtl8152_open (introduced with
the original change) because it cannot happen:

 - After this patch, runtime resume will not set it during rtl8152_open.
 - When link is up, rtl8152_open is not called.
 - When link is down during system/auto suspend/resume, it is not set.
