bpf tools: Improve libbpf error reporting

In this patch, a series of libbpf specific error numbers and
libbpf_strerror() are introduced to help reporting errors.

Functions are updated to pass correct the error number through the
CHECK_ERR() macro.

All users of bpf_object__open{_buffer}() and bpf_program__title() in
perf are modified accordingly. In addition, due to the error codes
changing, bpf__strerror_load() is also modified to use them.

bpf__strerror_head() is also changed accordingly so it can parse libbpf
errors. bpf_loader_strerror() is introduced for that purpose, and will
be improved by the following patch.

load_program() is improved not to dump log buffer if it is empty. log
buffer is also used to deduce whether the error was caused by an invalid
program or other problem.

v1 -> v2:

 - Using macro for error code.

 - Fetch error message based on array index, eliminate for-loop.

 - Use log buffer to detect the reason of failure. 3 new error code
   are introduced to replace LIBBPF_ERRNO__LOAD.

In v1:

  # perf record -e ./test_ill_program.o ls
  event syntax error: './test_ill_program.o'
                       \___ Failed to load program: Validate your program and check 'license'/'version' sections in your object
  SKIP

  # perf record -e ./test_kversion_nomatch_program.o ls
  event syntax error: './test_kversion_nomatch_program.o'
                       \___ Failed to load program: Validate your program and check 'license'/'version' sections in your object
  SKIP

  # perf record -e ./test_big_program.o ls
  event syntax error: './test_big_program.o'
                       \___ Failed to load program: Validate your program and check 'license'/'version' sections in your object
  SKIP

  In v2:

  # perf record -e ./test_ill_program.o ls
  event syntax error: './test_ill_program.o'
                       \___ Kernel verifier blocks program loading
  SKIP

  # perf record -e ./test_kversion_nomatch_program.o
  event syntax error: './test_kversion_nomatch_program.o'
                       \___ Incorrect kernel version
  SKIP
  (Will be further improved by following patches)

  # perf record -e ./test_big_program.o
  event syntax error: './test_big_program.o'
                       \___ Program too big
  SKIP
