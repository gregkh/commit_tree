ALSA: hda - Fix noise problems on Thinkpad T440s

Lenovo Thinkpad T440s suffers from constant background noises, and it
seems to be a generic hardware issue on this model:

As the noise comes from the analog loopback path, disabling the path
is the easy workaround.

Also, the machine gives significant cracking noises at PM suspend.  A
workaround found by trial-and-error is to disable the shutup callback
currently used for ALC269-variant.

This patch addresses these noise issues by introducing a new fixup
chain.  Although the same workaround might be applicable to other
Thinkpad models, it's applied only to T440s (17aa:220c) in this patch,
so far, just to be safe (you chicken!).  As a compromise, a new model
option string "tp440" is provided now, though, so that owners of other
Thinkpad models can test it more easily.
