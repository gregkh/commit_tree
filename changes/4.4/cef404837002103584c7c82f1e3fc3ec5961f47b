Btrfs: keep track of largest extent in bitmaps

We can waste a lot of time searching through bitmaps when we are heavily
fragmented trying to find large contiguous areas that don't exist in the bitmap.
So keep track of the max extent size when we do a full search of a bitmap so
that next time around we can just skip the expensive searching if our max size
is less than what we are looking for.  Thanks,
