isdn: Partially revert debug format string usage clean up

Commit 35a4a57 ("isdn: clean up debug format string usage") introduced
a safeguard to avoid accidential format string interpolation of data
when calling debugl1 or HiSax_putstatus. This did however not take into
account VHiSax_putstatus (called by HiSax_putstatus) does *not* call
vsprintf if the head parameter is NULL - the format string is treated
as plain text then instead. As a result, the string "%s" is processed
literally, and the actual information is lost. This affects the isdnlog
userspace program which stopped logging information since that commit.

So revert the HiSax_putstatus invocations to the previous state.
