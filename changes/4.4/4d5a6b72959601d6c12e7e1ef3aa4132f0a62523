s390/pci_dma: unify label of invalid translation table entries

Newly allocated translation table entries are flagged as invalid
and protected. If an existing translation table entry is invalidated,
the protection flag is left unchanged.

If a page (with invalid and protection flag set) is accessed it's
undefined which type of exception we'll receive.

Make sure to always set the invalid flag only.
