sd: Clear PS bit before Mode Select.

According to SPC-4, in a Mode Select, the PS bit in Mode Pages is
reserved and must be set to 0 by the driver.  In the sd implementation,
function cache_type_store does a Mode Sense, which might set the PS bit
on the read buffer, followed by a Mode Select, which receives the same
buffer, without explicitly clearing the PS bit.  So, in cases where
target supports saving the Mode Page to a non-volatile location, we end
up doing a Mode Select with the PS bit set, which could cause an illegal
request error if the target is checking this.

This was observed on a new firmware change, which was subsequently
reverted, but this changes sd.c to be more compliant with SPC-4.

This patch clears the PS bit in the buffer returned by Mode Select,
right before it is used in the Mode Select command.
