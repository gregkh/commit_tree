cgroup: pids: kill pids_fork(), simplify pids_can_fork() and pids_cancel_fork()

Now that we know that the forking task can't migrate amd the child is always
moved to the same cgroup by cgroup_post_fork()->css_set_move_task() we can
change pids_can_fork() and pids_cancel_fork() to just use task_css(current).
And since we no longer need to pin this css, we can remove pid_fork().

Note: the patch uses task_css_check(true), perhaps it makes sense to add a
helper or change task_css_set_check() to take cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem into
account.
