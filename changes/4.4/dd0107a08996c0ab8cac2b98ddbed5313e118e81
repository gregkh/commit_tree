IB/iser: set block queue_virt_boundary

The block layer can reliably guarantee that SG lists won't
contain gaps (page unaligned) if a driver set the queue
virt_boundary.

With this setting the block layer will:
- refuse merges if bios are not aligned to the virtual boundary
- split bios/requests that are not aligned to the virtual boundary
- or, bounce buffer SG_IOs that are not aligned to the virtual boundary

Since iser is working in 4K page size, set the virt_boundary to
4K pages. With this setting, we can now safely remove the bounce
buffering logic in iser.
