xen/balloon: use hotplugged pages for foreign mappings etc.

alloc_xenballooned_pages() is used to get ballooned pages to back
foreign mappings etc.  Instead of having to balloon out real pages,
use (if supported) hotplugged memory.

This makes more memory available to the guest and reduces
fragmentation in the p2m.

This is only enabled if the xen.balloon.hotplug_unpopulated sysctl is
set to 1.  This sysctl defaults to 0 in case the udev rules to
automatically online hotplugged memory do not exist.
