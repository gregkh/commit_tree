drm/i915/userptr: Kill user_size limit check

GTT was only 32b and its max value is 4GB. In order to allow objects
bigger than 4GB in 48b PPGTT, i915_gem_userptr_ioctl we could check
against max 48b range (1ULL << 48).

But since the check no longer applies, just kill the limit.

v2: Use the default ctx to infer the ppgtt max size (Akash).
v3: Just kill the limit, it was only there for early detection of an
error when used for execbuffer (Chris).
