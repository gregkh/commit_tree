mpls: fix sending of local encapped packets

Locally generated IPv4 and (probably) IPv6 packets are dropped because
skb->protocol isn't set. We could write wrappers to lwtunnel_output
for IPv4 and IPv6 that set the protocol accordingly and then call
lwtunnel_output, but mpls_output relies on the AF-specific type of dst
anyway to get the via address.

Therefore, make use of dst->dst_ops->family in mpls_output to
determine the type of nexthop and thus protocol of the packet instead
of checking skb->protocol.
