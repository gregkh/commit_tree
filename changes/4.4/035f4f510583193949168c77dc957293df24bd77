cgroup: replace error handling in cgroup_init() with WARN_ON()s

The init sequence shouldn't fail short of bugs and even when it does
it's better to continue with the rest of initialization and we were
silently ignoring /proc/cgroups creation failure.

Drop the explicit error handling and wrap sysfs_create_mount_point(),
register_filesystem() and proc_create() with WARN_ON()s.
