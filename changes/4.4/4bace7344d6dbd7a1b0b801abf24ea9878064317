rcu_sync: Cleanup the CONFIG_PROVE_RCU checks

1. Rename __rcu_sync_is_idle() to rcu_sync_lockdep_assert() and
   change it to use rcu_lockdep_assert().

2. Change rcu_sync_is_idle() to return rsp->gp_state == GP_IDLE
   unconditonally, this way we can remove the same check from
   rcu_sync_lockdep_assert() and clearly isolate the debugging
   code.

Note: rcu_sync_enter()->wait_event(gp_state == GP_PASSED) needs
another CONFIG_PROVE_RCU check, the same as is done in ->sync(); but
this needs some simple preparations in the core RCU code to avoid the
code duplication.
