usb: xhci: fix checking ep busy for CFC

Function ep_ring_is_processing() checks the dequeue pointer
in endpoint context to know whether an endpoint is busy with
processing TRBs. This is not correct since dequeue pointer
field in an endpoint context is only valid when the endpoint
is in Halted or Stopped states. This buggy code causes audio
noise when playing sound with USB headset connected to host
controllers which support CFC (one of xhci 1.1 features).

This patch should exist in stable kernel since v4.3.
