drm/i915: Always program unique transition scale for CHV

The docs give you the impression that the unique transition scale
value shouldn't matter when unique transition scale is enabled. But
as Imre found on BXT (and I verfied also on BSW) the value does
matter. So from now on just program the same value 0x9a always.
