mm, page_alloc: remove MIGRATE_RESERVE

MIGRATE_RESERVE preserves an old property of the buddy allocator that
existed prior to fragmentation avoidance -- min_free_kbytes worth of pages
tended to remain contiguous until the only alternative was to fail the
allocation.  At the time it was discovered that high-order atomic
allocations relied on this property so MIGRATE_RESERVE was introduced.  A
later patch will introduce an alternative MIGRATE_HIGHATOMIC so this patch
deletes MIGRATE_RESERVE and supporting code so it'll be easier to review.
Note that this patch in isolation may look like a false regression if
someone was bisecting high-order atomic allocation failures.
