ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add FE and BE hw_params handling

For FE and BE, the PCM parameters come from FE and BE hw_params
values passed. For a FE we convert the FE params to DSP expected
module format and pass to DSP. For a BE we need to find the
gateway settings (i2s/PDM) to be applied. These are queried from
NHLT table and applied.

Further for BE based on direction the settings are applied as
either source or destination parameters.

These helpers here allow the format to be calculated and queried
as per firmware format.
