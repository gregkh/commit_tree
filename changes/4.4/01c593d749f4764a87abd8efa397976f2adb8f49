powerpc/fsl-booke-64: Allow booting from the secondary thread

This allows SMP kernels to work as kdump crash kernels.  While crash
kernels don't really need to be SMP, this prevents things from breaking
if a user does it anyway (which is not something you want to only find
out once the main kernel has crashed in the field, especially if
whether it works or not depends on which cpu crashed).
