regulator: Use regulator_lock_supply() for get_voltage() too

Since we need to read voltages of parents as part of setting supply
voltages we need to be able to do get_voltage() internally without
taking locks so reorganize the locking to take locks on the full tree on
entry rather than as we recurse when called externally.
