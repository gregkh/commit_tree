block: fix plug list flushing for nomerge queues

Request queues with merging disabled will not flush the plug list after
BLK_MAX_REQUEST_COUNT requests have been queued, since the code relies
on blk_attempt_plug_merge to compute the request_count.  Fix this by
computing the number of queued requests even for nomerge queues.
