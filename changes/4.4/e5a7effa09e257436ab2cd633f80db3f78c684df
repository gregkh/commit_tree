i2c: rcar: revoke START request early

If we don't clear START generation as soon as possible, it may cause
another message to be generated. To keep the race window as small as
possible, we clear it right at the beginning of the interrupt. We don't
need checking since we always want to stop START and STOP generation on
the next occasion after we started it.

This patch improves the situation but sadly does not completely fix it.
It is still to be researched if we can do better given this HW design.
