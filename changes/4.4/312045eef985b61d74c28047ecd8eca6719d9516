md: remove check for MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED in action_store.

md currently doesn't allow a 'sync_action' such as 'reshape' to be set
while MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED is set.

This s a problem, particularly since commit 738a273806ee as that can
cause ->check_shape to call mddev_resume() which sets
MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED.  So by the time we come to start 'reshape' it is
very likely that MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED is still set.

Testing for this flag is not really needed and is in any case very
racy as it can be set at any moment - asynchronously.  Any race
between setting a sync_action and setting MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED must
already be handled properly in some locked code, probably
md_check_recovery(), so remove the test here.

The test on MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING is also racy in the 'reshape' case
so we should test it again after getting mddev_lock().

As this fixes a race and a regression which can cause 'reshape' to
fail, it is suitable for -stable kernels since 4.1
