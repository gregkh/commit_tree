arm64: dts: Drop linux,pci-probe-only from the Seattle DTS

The linux,pci-probe-only property mandates an argument to indicate whether
or not to engage the "probe-only" mode, but the Seattle DTS just provides a
naked property, which is illegal.

Also, it turns out that the board is perfectly happy without probe-only, so
let's drop this altogether.
