perf env: Adopt perf_header__set_cmdline

Move this from two globals to perf_env global, that eventually will
be just perf_header->env or something else, to ease the refactoring
series, leave it as a global and go on reading more of its fields,
not as part of the header writing process but as a perf_env init one
that will be used for perf.data-less situations.
