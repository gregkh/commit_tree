usb: dwc2: host: enter hibernation during bus suspend

Disable controller power and enter hibernation when usb bus is
suspended. A phy driver is required to disable the power of the
controller and detect remote-wakeup or disconnection since the
controller will not be able to detect these in this state.

Once the phy driver detects bus activity, it must call
usb_hcd_resume_root_hub.
