There are several spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the
driver. Additionally there are a handful of places where there
are extra lines and unnecessary variables/statements. These are
a nuisance and pollute the driver.

Fix spelling and grammar issues. Update some comments for clarity and
consistency. Remove extra lines and a few unneeded variables/statements.
