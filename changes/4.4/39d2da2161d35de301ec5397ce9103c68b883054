kernel/watchdog.c: fix race between proc_watchdog_thresh() and watchdog_timer_fn()

Theoretically it is possible that the watchdog timer expires right at the
time when a user sets 'watchdog_thresh' to zero (note: this disables the
lockup detectors).  In this scenario, the is_softlockup() function - which
is called by the timer - could produce a false positive.

Fix this by checking the current value of 'watchdog_thresh'.
