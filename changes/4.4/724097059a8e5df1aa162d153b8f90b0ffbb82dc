ALSA: firewire-tascam: off by one in handle_midi_tx()

My static checker complains because tscm->spec->midi_capture_ports is
either 2 or 4 but the tscm->tx_midi_substreams[] array has 4 elements so
this is possibly off by one.  I have looked at the code and I think it
should be >= instead of > as well.
