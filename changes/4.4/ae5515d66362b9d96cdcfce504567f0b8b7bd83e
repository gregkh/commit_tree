Revert: "vfio: Include No-IOMMU mode"

Revert commit 033291eccbdb ("vfio: Include No-IOMMU mode") due to lack
of a user.  This was originally intended to fill a need for the DPDK
driver, but uptake has been slow so rather than support an unproven
kernel interface revert it and revisit when userspace catches up.
