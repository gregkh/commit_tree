f2fs: fix to avoid redundant searching in dirty map during gc

When doing gc, we search a victim in dirty map, starting from position of
last victim, we will reset the current searching position until we touch
the end of dirty map, and then search the whole diryt map. So sometimes we
will search the range [victim, last] twice, it's redundant, this patch
avoids this issue.
