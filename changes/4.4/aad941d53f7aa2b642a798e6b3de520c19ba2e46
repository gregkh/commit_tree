drm/i915: Always use crtc_ timings when dealing with adjustead_mode

The adjustead_mode crtc_ timings are what we will program into the hardware,
so it's those timings we should be looking practically everywhere.

The normal and crtc_ timings should differ only when stere doubling is
used. In that case the normal timings are the orignal non-doubled
timigns, and crtc_ timings are the doubled timings used by the hardware.

The only case where we continue to look at the normal timings is when we
pass the adjusted_mode to drm_match_{cea,hdmi}_mode() to find the VIC.
drm_edid keeps the modes aronund in the non-double form only, so it
needs the non-double timings to match against.

Done with sed
's/adjusted_mode->\([vhVH]\)/adjusted_mode->crtc_\1/g'
's/adjusted_mode->clock/adjusted_mode->crtc_clock/g'
with a manual s/VDisplay/vdisplay/ within the comment in intel_dvo.c

v2: Update due to intel_dsi.c changes
