cpufreq: s3c24xx: Do not mark s3c2410_plls_add as __init

s3c2410_plls_add is a device notifier that may be called at runtime and
is correctly not marked __init. However it calls s3c_plltab_register()
which is marked __init, and that triggers a build error when we are
checking for section mismatches:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x195e0): Section mismatch in reference from the function s3c2410_plls_add() to the function .init.text:s3c_plltab_register()
The function s3c2410_plls_add() references
the function __init s3c_plltab_register().
This is often because s3c2410_plls_add lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of s3c_plltab_register is wrong.

This removes the __init annotation from s3c2410_plls_add as well as the
__initdata section annotations from s3c2440_plls_12 and s3c2440_plls_169344,
which in turn are referenced from s3c2410_plls_add.
