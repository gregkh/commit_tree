Btrfs: don't loop in allocator for space cache

The space cache needs to have contiguous allocations, and the allocator tries to
make allocations by reducing the amount of bytes requested and re-searching.
But this just makes us waste time when we are very fragmented, so if we can't
find our space just exit, don't bother trying to search again.  Thanks,
