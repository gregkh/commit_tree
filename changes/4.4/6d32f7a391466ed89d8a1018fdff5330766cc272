checkpatch: improve the unnecessary initialisers tests

Global and static variables don't need to be initialized to 0.

There is already a test for this but the output message doesn't
mention booleans initialized to false.

Improve the output message and the test by adding various forms
with possible specific integer types and possible multiple zeros.

Miscellanea:

o Use a variable to hold the possible 0 test
