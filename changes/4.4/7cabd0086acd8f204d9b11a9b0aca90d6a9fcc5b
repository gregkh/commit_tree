irqchip/gic-v3: Make gic_enable_sre an inline function

In order for gic_enable_sre to be used by the arm64 core code,
move it to arm-gic-v3.h. As a bonus, we now also check if
system registers have been already enabled, and return early
if they have.

In all cases, the function now returns a boolean indicating if
the enabling has been successful.
