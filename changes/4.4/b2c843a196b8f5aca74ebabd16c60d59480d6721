ARM/dmaengine: edma: Remove limitation on the number of eDMA controllers

Since the driver stack no longer depends on lookup with id number in a
global array of pointers, the limitation for the number of eDMAs are no
longer needed. We can handle as many eDMAs in legacy and DT boot as we have
memory for them to allocate the needed structures.
