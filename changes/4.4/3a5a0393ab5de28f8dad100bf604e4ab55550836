drm/i915: fix crash in error state readout on non-execlist platforms v2

    drm/i915: Integrate GuC-based command submission

This patch assumed LRC contexts and HWS layout, which is incorrect on
platforms without execlists.  This can lead to a crash in GPU error
state readout on those platforms.

I don't see a bug filed for this, but there may be one that I haven't
found.
