sched: Export sched_setscheduler_nocheck

The new locktorture rtmutex_lock tests exercise priority boosting, which
means that they need to set some tasks to real-time priority.  To do this,
they use sched_setscheduler_nocheck().  However, this is not exported to
modules, which results in the following error when building locktorture
as a module:

ERROR: "sched_setscheduler_nocheck" [kernel/locking/locktorture.ko] undefined!

This commit therefore adds an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() to allow this function
to be invoked from locktorture when built as a module.
