bridge: vlan: use proper rcu for the vlgrp member

The bridge and port's vlgrp member is already used in RCU way, currently
we rely on the fact that it cannot disappear while the port exists but
that is error-prone and we might miss places with improper locking
(either RCU or RTNL must be held to walk the vlan_list). So make it
official and use RCU for vlgrp to catch offenders. Introduce proper vlgrp
accessors and use them consistently throughout the code.
