ALSA: firewire-tascam: clear extra MIDI bytes in an asynchronous transaction

When MIDI buffer stores two or more MIDI messages, TASCAM driver
transfers asynchronous transactions including one MIDI message and
extra bytes from second MIDI message.

This commit fixes this bug by clearing needless bytes in the buffer. The
consumed bytes are already calculated correctly, thus the sequence of
transactions is already correct.
