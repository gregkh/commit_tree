Bluetooth: Send index information updates to monitor channel

The Bluetooth public device address might change during controller setup
and it makes it a lot simpler for monitoring tools if they just get told
what the new address is. In addition include the manufacturer / company
information of the controller. That allows for easy vendor specific HCI
command and event handling.
