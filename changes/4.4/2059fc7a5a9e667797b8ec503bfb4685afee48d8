perf symbols: Allow forcing reading of non-root owned files by root

When the root user tries to read a file owned by some other user we get:

  # ls -la perf.data
  -rw-------. 1 acme acme 20032 Nov 12 15:50 perf.data
  # perf report
  File perf.data not owned by current user or root (use -f to override)
  # perf report -f | grep -v ^# | head -2
    30.96%  ls       [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] do_set_pte
    28.24%  ls       libc-2.20.so      [.] intel_check_word
  #

That wasn't happening when the symbol code tried to read a JIT map,
where the same check was done but no forcing was possible, fix it.
