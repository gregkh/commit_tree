serial: sh-sci: Handle DMA init failures inside sci_request_dma()

Let sci_request_dma() handle failures to initialize DMA itself.
This way sci_tx_dma_release() and sci_rx_dma_release() don't have to
consider partial initialization, and thus don't need to reset DMA
addresses to DMA_ERROR_CODE, which is not 100% portable access
architectures.
