iio: remove gpio interrupt probing from drivers that use a single interrupt

Commit 845c877009cf014b ("i2c / ACPI: Assign IRQ for devices that have
GpioInt automatically") automatically assigns the first ACPI GPIO
interrupt in client->irq, so we can remove the probing code from
drivers that use only one interrupt.
