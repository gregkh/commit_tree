ALSA: dice: correct variable types for __be32 data

Some local variables in some functions are typed as unsigned int, while
__be32 value is assigned to them. This causes sparse warnings.

dice-stream.c:50:17: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
dice-stream.c:50:17:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] channel
dice-stream.c:50:17:    got restricted __be32 [usertype] <noident>
dice-stream.c:74:17: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
dice-stream.c:74:17:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] channel
dice-stream.c:74:17:    got restricted __be32 [usertype] <noident>

This commit fixes this bug.
