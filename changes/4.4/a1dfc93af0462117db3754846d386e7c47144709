staging: lustre: add a service that prints a nidlist

The libcfs already provides services to parse a string into a nidlist
and to match a nid into a nidlist. This patch implements a service
that prints a nidlist into a buffer.

This is required for instance to print the nosquash_nids parameter
of the MDT procfs component.

Additionally, this patch fixes a bug in return code of
parse_addrange() routine, so that parsing of nids including
a * character works fine ('*@elan' for instance).
