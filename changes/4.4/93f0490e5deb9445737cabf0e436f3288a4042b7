Revert "mac80211: remove exposing 'mfp' to drivers"

This reverts commit 5c48f1201744233d4f235c7dd916d5196ed20716.

Some device drivers (ath10k) offload part of aggregation including AddBA/DelBA
negotiations to firmware. In such scenario, the PMF configuration of
the station needs to be provided to driver to enable encryption of
AddBA/DelBA action frames.
