arm64: Make the CPU information more clear

At early boot, we print the CPU version/revision. On a heterogeneous
system, we could have different types of CPUs. Print the CPU info for
all active cpus. Also, the secondary CPUs prints the message only when
they turn online.

Also, remove the redundant 'revision' information which doesn't
make any sense without the 'variant' field.
