mm/maccess.c: actually return -EFAULT from strncpy_from_unsafe

As far as I can tell, strncpy_from_unsafe never returns -EFAULT.  ret is
the result of a __copy_from_user_inatomic(), which is 0 for success and
positive (in this case necessarily 1) for access error - it is never
negative.  So we were always returning the length of the, possibly
truncated, destination string.
