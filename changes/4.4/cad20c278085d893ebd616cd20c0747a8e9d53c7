Bluetooth: Don't use remote address type to decide IRK persistency

There are LE devices on the market that start off by announcing their
public address and then once paired switch to using private address.
To be interoperable with such devices we should simply trust the fact
that we're receiving an IRK from them to indicate that they may use
private addresses in the future. Instead, simply tie the persistency
to the bonding/no-bonding information the same way as for LTKs and
CSRKs.
