kvm/x86: Hyper-V HV_X64_MSR_VP_INDEX export for QEMU.

Insert Hyper-V HV_X64_MSR_VP_INDEX into msr's emulated list,
so QEMU can set Hyper-V features cpuid HV_X64_MSR_VP_INDEX_AVAILABLE
bit correctly. KVM emulation part is in place already.

Necessary to support loading of winhv.sys in guest, which in turn is
required to support Windows VMBus.
