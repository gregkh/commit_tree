cls_bpf: further limit exec opcodes subset

Jamal suggested to further limit the currently allowed subset of opcodes
that may be used by a direct action return code as the intention is not
to replace the full action engine, but rather to have a minimal set that
can be used in the fast-path on things like ingress for some features
that cls_bpf supports.

Classifiers can, of course, still be chained together that have direct
action mode with those that have a full exec pass. For more complex
scenarios that go beyond this minimal set here, the full tcf_exts_exec()
path must be used.
