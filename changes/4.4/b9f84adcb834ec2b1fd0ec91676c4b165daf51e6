i2c: designware: Disable interrupts before requesting PCI device interrupt

Device must not generate interrupts before registering the interrupt
handler so move i2c_dw_disable_int() before requesting it.

There are no known issues with this. The code has been here since commit
fe20ff5c7e9c ("i2c-designware: Add support for Designware core behind PCI
devices.").
