sched/wait: Fix the signal handling fix

Jan Stancek reported that I wrecked things for him by fixing things for
Vladimir :/

His report was due to an UNINTERRUPTIBLE wait getting -EINTR, which
should not be possible, however my previous patch made this possible by
unconditionally checking signal_pending().

We cannot use current->state as was done previously, because the
instruction after the store to that variable it can be changed.  We must
instead pass the initial state along and use that.
