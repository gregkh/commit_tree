ACPI / EC: Fix a race issue in acpi_ec_guard_event()

In acpi_ec_guard_event(), EC transaction state machine variables should be
checked with the EC spinlock locked.
The bug doesn't trigger any real issue now because this bug can only occur
when the ec_event_clearing=event mode is applied while there is no user
currently using this mode.
