mm, dax: fix DAX deadlocks (COW fault)

DAX handling of COW faults has wrong locking sequence:
	dax_fault does i_mmap_lock_read
	do_cow_fault does i_mmap_unlock_write

Ross's commit[1] missed a fix[2] that Kirill added to Matthew's
commit[3].

Original COW locking logic was introduced by Matthew here[4].

This should be applied to v4.3 as well.
