iio: mma8452: add support for MMA8652FC and MMA8653FC

MMA8652FC and MMA8653FC don't provide the transient interrupt source, so
the motion interrupt source is used by providing a new iio_chan_spec
definition, so that other supported devices are not affected by this.

Datasheets for the newly supported devices are available at Freescale's
website:
