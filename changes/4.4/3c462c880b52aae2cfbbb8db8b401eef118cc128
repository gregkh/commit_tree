md: Increment version for clustered bitmaps

Add BITMAP_MAJOR_CLUSTERED as 5, in order to prevent older kernels
to assemble a clustered device.

In order to maximize compatibility, the major version is set to
BITMAP_MAJOR_CLUSTERED *only* if the bitmap is clustered.

Added MD_FEATURE_CLUSTERED in order to return error for older
kernels which would assemble MD even if the bitmap is corrupted.
