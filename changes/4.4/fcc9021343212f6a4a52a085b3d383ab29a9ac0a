drm: move drm_class into drm_sysfs.c

Right now, drm_sysfs_create() returns the newly allocated "struct class"
to the caller (which is drm_core_init()), which then has to set the
global variable 'drm_class'. During cleanup, though, we call
drm_sysfs_destroy() which implicitly uses the global 'drm_class'. This is
confusing, as ownership of the global 'drm_class' is non-obvious.

This patch changes drm_sysfs_create() to drm_sysfs_init() and makes it
initialize the 'drm_class' object directly, rather than returning it.
This way, both drm_sysfs_init() and drm_sysfs_destroy() work in a similar
fashion and manage the global drm class.
