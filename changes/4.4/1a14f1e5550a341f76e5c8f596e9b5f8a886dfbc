xfrm4: Fix header checks in _decode_session4.

We skip the header informations if the data pointer points
already behind the header in question for some protocols.
This is because we call pskb_may_pull with a negative value
converted to unsigened int from pskb_may_pull in this case.
Skipping the header informations can lead to incorrect policy
lookups, so fix it by a check of the data pointer position
before we call pskb_may_pull.
