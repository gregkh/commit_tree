mm: page_counter: let page_counter_try_charge() return bool

page_counter_try_charge() currently returns 0 on success and -ENOMEM on
failure, which is surprising behavior given the function name.

Make it follow the expected pattern of try_stuff() functions that return a
boolean true to indicate success, or false for failure.
