PM / Domains: Remove cpuidle attach

The power domains code allows to tie a cpuidle state with a power domain.

Preventing the cpuidle framework to enter a specific idle state by disabling
from the power domain framework is a good idea. Unfortunately, the current
implementation has some gaps with a SMP system and a complex cpuidle
implementation. Enabling a power domain wakes up all the cpus even if a cpu
does not belong to the power domain.

There is some work to do a logical representation with the power domains of
the hardware dependencies (eg. a cpu belongs to a power domains, these power
domains belong to a higher power domain for a cluster, etc ...). A new code
relying on the genpd hierarchy to disable the idle states would make more
sense.

As the unique user of this code has been removed, let's wipe out this code
to prevent new user and to have a clean place to put a new implementation.
