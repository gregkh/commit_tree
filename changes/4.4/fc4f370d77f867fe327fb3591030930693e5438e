Revert "ahci: added support for Freescale AHCI sata"

This reverts commit 5163fb62541e
("ahci: added support for Freescale AHCI sata")

The reverted patch added Freescale QorIQ AHCI sata support to
ahci_platform driver though, but it left SoC specific settings to uboot.
It leads to QorIQ sata heavily depending on uboot. In order to removing
the dependency we first revert the old patch and then will add a new driver
for QorIQ SATA.
Since there are no LS* platforms that have been upstreamed, So
the revert would not break anything exists.
