s390/bitops: implement cache friendly test_and_set_bit_lock

The generic implementation for test_and_set_bit_lock in include/asm-generic
uses the standard test_and_set_bit operation. This is done with either a
'csg' or a 'loag' instruction. For both version the cache line is fetched
exclusively, even if the bit is already set. The result is an increase in
cache traffic, for a contented lock this is a bad idea.
