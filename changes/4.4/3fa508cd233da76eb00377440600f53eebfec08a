pinctrl: atlas7: support atlas7 step B changes

The the pin groups and pin functions have been changed
in atlas7 step B soc. We have to update the driver
to support step B chip.

Changes:
1. add 5 jtag pins to IOC_TOP:
	"jtag_tdo", "jtag_tms","jtag_tck", "jtag_tdi", "jtag_trstn"
	these 5 pins can be mutiplex with other functions, so we
	have to conver these 5 pins in pinmux.
2. add pin groups for audio digmic, audio spdif, can transceiver
	en, can transceiver stb, i2s0, i2s1 and jtag.
3. serval pins can be located to more PADs:
	audio_uart0_urfs, audio_uart1_urfs, audio_uart2_urfs,
	audio_uart2_urxd, audio_uart2_usclk, audio_uart2_utfs,
	audio_uart2_utxd, can0_rxd, can0_txd, can1_rxd, can1_txd
	jtag_ntrst, jtag_swdiotms, jtag_tck, jtag_tdi, jtag_tdo,
	pw_cko0, pw_cko1, pw_i2s01, pw_pwm0, pw_pwm1, sd2_cdb,
	sd2_wpb, uart2_cts, uart2_rts, uart2_rxd, uart2_txd,
	uart3_cts, uart3_rts, uart3_rxd, uart3_txd, uart4_cts,
	uart4_rts, usb0_drvvbus, usb1_drvvbus.

Because of Changes#3, some functions should have more than one
pin groups. So we have to split the original pin group to serval
pin groups.

For example:
audio_uart0 has 5 pins, on STEPA, each of these 5 pins only has
one related PAD. But on STEPB, audio_uart0_urfs has 4 related
PAD.
So we place the 4 pins with one PAD into a single pin group:
	audio_uart0_basic_group.
and place urfs pin wtih different PADs to 4 different pin groups:
	audio_uart0_urfs_group0, ..., audio_uart0_urfs_group3

A full audio_uart0 pin group can be:
	pinctrl-0 = <&audio_uart0_basic_group &audio_uart0_urfs_group0>;
If audio_uart0 pin group encountered some confiction, we only have
to change the urfs group:
	pinctrl-0 = <&audio_uart0_basic_group &audio_uart0_urfs_group2>;
