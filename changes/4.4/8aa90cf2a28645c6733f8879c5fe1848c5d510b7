usb: dwc2: make otg clk optional

Fixes commit 09a75e857790
("usb: dwc2: refactor common low-level hw code to platform.c")

The above commit consolidated the low-level phy access into a common
location. This change made the otg clk a requirement and broke some
platforms when it was moved into platform.c.

So make clk handling optional again.
