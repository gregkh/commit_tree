ARM: 8441/2: twd: Don't set CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP unconditionally

In 5388a6b266 ("ARM: SMP: Always enable clock event broadcast support")
Russell noted that "the TWD local timers are unable to wake up the CPU
when it is placed into a low power mode".

However, some platforms do not stop the TWD block in low-power mode,
and can thus use the TWD timer in one-shot mode, without setting up
a broadcast device.

Make the driver check for the "always-on" boolean property, and set
the CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP flag accordingly.
