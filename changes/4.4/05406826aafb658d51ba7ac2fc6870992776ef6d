staging/lustre: use 64-bit llite debugfs timestamps

The llite debugfs interface contains timestamps that are computed
from timeval, which overflows in 2038 on 32-bit systems.

This changes the output to use a timespec64 type to avoid the
overflow. I also change the format to print the sub-second portion
as 9 digits (nanoseconds) for clarity, rather than printing six
digits without leading zeroes.
