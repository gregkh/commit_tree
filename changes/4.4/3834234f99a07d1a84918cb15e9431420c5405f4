staging: comedi: check command started by file being polled

Currently, the "poll" file operation checks if an asynchronous "read"
(or "write" command is active on the "read" (or "write" subdevice, but
does not consider whether the command was started from the file object
being polled.  Since that is the only file object able to read (or
write) data, take it into consideration.

With this change, if no read (or write) command is running on the
subdevice, or it is started by a different file object, the file object
is marked as readable (or writeable) regardless, but the read (or write)
file operation will return an error.
