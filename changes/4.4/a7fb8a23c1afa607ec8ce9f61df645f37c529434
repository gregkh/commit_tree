drm: Remove __OS_HAS_AGP

We already express the drm/agp depencies correctly in Kconfig, so we
can rip this remnant from the shared drm core days.

Aside: Pretty much all the #ifdefs in radeon/nouveau could be killed
if ttm would provide dummy functions. I'm not going to volunteer for
that though.

v2: Use IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_AGP) as suggested by Ville

v3: Polish from Ville's review.
