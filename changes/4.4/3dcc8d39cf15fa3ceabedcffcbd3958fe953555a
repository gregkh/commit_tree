PCI: Prevent out of bounds access in numa_node override

Commit 1266963170f5 ("PCI: Prevent out of bounds access in numa_node
override") missed that the user-provided node could also be negative.
Handle this case as well to avoid out-of-bounds accesses to the
node_states[] array.  However, allow the special value -1, i.e.
NUMA_NO_NODE, to be able to set the 'no specific node' configuration.
