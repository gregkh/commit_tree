ARC: [arcompact] entry.S: Improve early return from exception

The requirement is to
 - Reenable Exceptions (AE cleared)
 - Reenable Interrupts (E1/E2 set)

We need to do wiggle these bits into ERSTATUS and call RTIE.

Prev version used the pre-exception STATUS32 as starting point for what
goes into ERSTATUS. This required explicit fixups of U/DE/L bits.

Instead, use the current (in-exception) STATUS32 as starting point.
Being in exception handler U/DE/L can be safely assumed to be correct.
Only AE/E1/E2 need to be fixed.

So the new implementation is slightly better
 -Avoids read form memory
 -Is 4 bytes smaller for the typical 1 level of intr configuration
 -Depicts the semantics more clearly
