xen/grant: Add helper gnttab_page_grant_foreign_access_ref_one

Many PV drivers contain the idiom:

pfn = page_to_gfn(...) /* Or similar */
gnttab_grant_foreign_access_ref

Replace it by a new helper. Note that when Linux is using a different
page granularity than Xen, the helper only gives access to the first 4KB
grant.

This is useful where drivers are allocating a full Linux page for each
grant.

Also include xen/interface/grant_table.h rather than xen/grant_table.h in
asm/page.h for x86 to fix a compilation issue [1]. Only the former is
useful in order to get the structure definition.

[1] Interdependency between asm/page.h and xen/grant_table.h which result
to page_mfn not being defined when necessary.
