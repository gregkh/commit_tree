drm/i915/bxt: Use correct live status register for BXT platform

BXT platform uses live status bits from 0x44440 register to obtain DP
status on hotplug. The existing g4x_digital_port_connected() uses a
different register and hence misses DP hotplug events on BXT
platform. This patch fixes it by using the appropriate register(0x44440)
and live status bits(3:5).

Based on a patch by Durgadoss R <durgadoss.r@intel.com>, from whom the
commit message is shamelessly copy pasted.
