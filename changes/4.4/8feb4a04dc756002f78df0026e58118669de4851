KVM: Define a new interface kvm_intr_is_single_vcpu()

This patch defines a new interface kvm_intr_is_single_vcpu(),
which can returns whether the interrupt is for single-CPU or not.

It is used by VT-d PI, since now we only support single-CPU
interrupts, For lowest-priority interrupts, if user configures
it via /proc/irq or uses irqbalance to make it single-CPU, we
can use PI to deliver the interrupts to it. Full functionality
of lowest-priority support will be added later.
