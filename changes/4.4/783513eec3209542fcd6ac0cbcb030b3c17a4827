ASoC: Use nested lock for snd_soc_dapm_mutex_lock

snd_soc_dapm_mutex_lock currently uses the un-nested call which can
cause lockdep warnings when called from control handlers (a relatively
common usage) and using modules. As creating the control causes a
potential mutex inversion with the handler, creating the control will
take the controls_rwsem under the dapm_mutex and accessing the control
will take the dapm_mutex under controls_rwsem.

All the users look like they want to be using the runtime class of the
lock anyway, so this patch just changes snd_soc_dapm_mutex_lock to use
the nested call, with the SND_SOC_DAPM_CLASS_RUNTIME class.
