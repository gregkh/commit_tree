f2fs: fix overflow of size calculation

We have potential overflow issue when calculating size of object, when
we left shift index with PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT bits, if type of index has only
32-bits space in 32-bit architecture, left shifting will incur overflow,
i.e:

pgoff_t index =  0xFFFFFFFF;
loff_t size = index << PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
size: 0xFFFFF000

So we should cast index with 64-bits type to avoid this issue.
