sched/core: Drop unlikely behind BUG_ON()

(1) For !CONFIG_BUG cases, the bug call is a no-op, so we couldn't care
    less and the change is ok.

(2) PPC and MIPS, which HAVE_ARCH_BUG_ON, do not rely on branch predictions
    as it seems to be pointless [1] and thus callers should not be trying to
    push an optimization in the first place.

(3) For CONFIG_BUG and !HAVE_ARCH_BUG_ON cases, BUG_ON() contains an
    unlikely compiler flag already.

Hence, we can drop unlikely behind BUG_ON().
