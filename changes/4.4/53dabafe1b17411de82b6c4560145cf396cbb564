iio: generic_buffer: be helpful about enabling channels

Currently if generic_buffer is invoked without first enabling any
channels in scan_elements/*_en, it will fail unable to enable the
buffer because bytes_per_datum inside the kernel will be zero if
no channels are available.

It is implied that the user of the program should enable channels
manually or with a script before executing generic_buffer.

Be more helpful by stopping execution if no enabled channels can
be found, and print a helptext that will tell you what is wrong
and what needs to be done.
