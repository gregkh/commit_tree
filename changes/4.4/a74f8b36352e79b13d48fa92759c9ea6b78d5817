tpm: introduce tpm_buf

This patch introduces struct tpm_buf that provides a string buffer for
constructing TPM commands. This allows to construct variable sized TPM
commands. For the buffer a page is allocated and mapped, which limits
maximum size to PAGE_SIZE.

Variable sized TPM commands are needed in order to add algorithmic
agility.
