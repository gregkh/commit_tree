net: hisilicon: fixes a bug when using ethtool -S

this patch fixes a bug in hns driver. when we want to get statistic info
by using ethtool -S, it shows us there are 3 wrong counters info. because
the strings related to the registers are wrong. it needs to modify the
strings which give us wrong info.
