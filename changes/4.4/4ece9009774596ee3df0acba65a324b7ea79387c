sit: fix sit0 percpu double allocations

sit0 device allocates its percpu storage twice :
- One time in ipip6_tunnel_init()
- One time in ipip6_fb_tunnel_init()

Thus we leak 48 bytes per possible cpu per network namespace dismantle.

ipip6_fb_tunnel_init() can be much simpler and does not
return an error, and should be called after register_netdev()

Note that ipip6_tunnel_clone_6rd() also needs to be called
after register_netdev() (calling ipip6_tunnel_init())

Fixes: ebe084aafb7e ("sit: Use ipip6_tunnel_init as the ndo_init function.")
