cgroup: replace cgroup_on_dfl() tests in controllers with cgroup_subsys_on_dfl()

cgroup_on_dfl() tests whether the cgroup's root is the default
hierarchy; however, an individual controller is only interested in
whether the controller is attached to the default hierarchy and never
tests a cgroup which doesn't belong to the hierarchy that the
controller is attached to.

This patch replaces cgroup_on_dfl() tests in controllers with faster
static_key based cgroup_subsys_on_dfl().  This leaves cgroup core as
the only user of cgroup_on_dfl() and the function is moved from the
header file to cgroup.c.
