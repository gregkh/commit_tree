xen, cpu_hotplug: call device_offline instead of cpu_down

When offlining a cpu, instead of cpu_down, call device_offline, which
also takes care of updating the cpu.dev.offline field. This keeps the
sysfs file /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/online, up to date.  Also move
the call to disable_hotplug_cpu, because it makes more sense to have it
there.

We don't call device_online at cpu-hotplug time, because that would
immediately take the cpu online, while we want to retain the current
behaviour: the user needs to explicitly enable the cpu after it has
been hotplugged.
