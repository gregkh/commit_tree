mac80211: fix off-channel mgmt-tx uninitialized variable usage

In the last change here, I neglected to update the cookie in one code
path: when a mgmt-tx has no real cookie sent to userspace as it doesn't
wait for a response, but is off-channel. The original code used the SKB
pointer as the cookie and always assigned the cookie to the TX SKB in
ieee80211_start_roc_work(), but my change turned this around and made
the code rely on a valid cookie being passed in.

Unfortunately, the off-channel no-wait TX path wasn't assigning one at
all, resulting in an uninitialized stack value being used. This wasn't
handed back to userspace as a cookie (since in the no-wait case there
isn't a cookie), but it was tested for non-zero to distinguish between
mgmt-tx and off-channel.

Fix this by assigning a dummy non-zero cookie unconditionally, and get
rid of a misleading comment and some dead code while at it. I'll clean
up the ACK SKB handling separately later.
