PCI: iproc: Fix PCIe reset logic

The current reset logic does not always properly reset the device.  For
example, in the case when the perst_b signal is already de-asserted in the
bootloader, the current reset logic fails to trigger a proper assert ->
de-assert reset sequence.

Fix the issue by always triggering the proper reset sequence.

Also explicitly select the desired reset source, i.e., perst_b, and reduce
the wait time after the device comes out of reset from 250 ms to 100 ms,
based on recommendation from the ASIC team.
