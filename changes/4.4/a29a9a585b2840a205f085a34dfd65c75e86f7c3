netfilter: nfnetlink_log: allow to attach conntrack

This patch enables to include the conntrack information together
with the packet that is sent to user-space via NFLOG, then a
user-space program can acquire NATed information by this NFULA_CT
attribute.

Including the conntrack information is optional, you can set it
via NFULNL_CFG_F_CONNTRACK flag with the NFULA_CFG_FLAGS attribute
like NFQUEUE.
