crypto: caam - Remove unused JUMP_TYPE_MASK definition

Commit a1efb01feca597b ("jump_label, locking/static_keys: Rename
JUMP_LABEL_TYPE_* and related helpers to the static_key* pattern")
introduced the definition of JUMP_TYPE_MASK in
include/linux/jump_label.h causing the following name collision:

In file included from drivers/crypto/caam/desc_constr.h:7:0,
                 from drivers/crypto/caam/ctrl.c:15:
drivers/crypto/caam/desc.h:1495:0: warning: "JUMP_TYPE_MASK" redefined
 #define JUMP_TYPE_MASK  (0x03 << JUMP_TYPE_SHIFT)
 ^
In file included from include/linux/module.h:19:0,
                 from drivers/crypto/caam/compat.h:9,
                 from drivers/crypto/caam/ctrl.c:11:
include/linux/jump_label.h:131:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
 #define JUMP_TYPE_MASK 1UL

As JUMP_TYPE_MASK definition in desc.h is never used, we can safely remove
it to avoid the name collision.
