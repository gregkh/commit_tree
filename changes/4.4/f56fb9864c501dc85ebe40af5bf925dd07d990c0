perf inject: Add --strip option to strip out non-synthesized events

Add a new option --strip which is used with --itrace to strip out
non-synthesized events.  This results in a perf.data file that is
simpler for external tools to parse.  In particular, this can be used to
prepare a perf.data file for consumption by autofdo.

A subsequent patch makes a change to Intel PT also to enable use with
autofdo and gives an example of that use.
