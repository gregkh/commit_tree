perf stat: Quieten failed to read counter message

Since 3b3eb0445 running perf stat on a system without
backend-stalled-cycles spits out ugly warnings by default.

Since that is quite common, make the message a debug message only.

We know anyways that the counter wasn't read by the normal <unsupported>
output.
