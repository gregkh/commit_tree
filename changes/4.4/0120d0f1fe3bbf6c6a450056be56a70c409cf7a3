ALSA: firewire-digi00x: add PCM functionality

This commit adds PCM functionality to transmit/receive PCM samples.

Any PCM substreams are jointed because incoming/outgoing AMDTP streams
are bound. When one of PCM substream is running or external clock source
is selected, current sampling rate is used. Else, the sampling rate is
changed as an userspace application requests.
