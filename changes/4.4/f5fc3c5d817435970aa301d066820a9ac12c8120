mm: memcontrol: eliminate root memory.current

memory.current on the root level doesn't add anything that wouldn't be
more accurate and detailed using system statistics.  It already doesn't
include slabs, and it'll be a pain to keep in sync when further memory
types are accounted in the memory controller.  Remove it.

Note that this applies to the new unified hierarchy interface only.
