drm/i915: Force common lane on for the PPS kick on CHV

With DPIO powergating active the DPLL can't be accessed unless
something else is keeping the common lane in the channel on.
That means the PPS kick procedure could fail to enable the PLL.

Power up some data lanes to force the common lane to power up
so that the PLL can be enabled temporarily.
