KVM: nVMX: remove incorrect vpid check in nested invvpid emulation

This patch removes the vpid check when emulating nested invvpid
instruction of type all-contexts invalidation. The existing code is
incorrect because:
 (1) According to Intel SDM Vol 3, Section "INVVPID - Invalidate
     Translations Based on VPID", invvpid instruction does not check
     vpid in the invvpid descriptor when its type is all-contexts
     invalidation.
 (2) According to the same document, invvpid of type all-contexts
     invalidation does not require there is an active VMCS, so/and
     get_vmcs12() in the existing code may result in a NULL-pointer
     dereference. In practice, it can crash both KVM itself and L1
     hypervisors that use invvpid (e.g. Xen).
