drm/i915: gen 9 can check for unclaimed registers too

Dear git bisect user,

Even though this is the patch that introduced the WARN() you're
bisecting, please notice that it's very likely that the problem you're
facing was already present before this commit. In other words: this
commit adds code to detect errors and give WARN()s about them, but the
errors were already there.

In order to continue your debug, please use the i915.mmio_debug
option, check the backtraces and try to discover which read or write
operation is causing the error message. Then check if this is
happening because the register does not exist or because its power
well is down when the operation is being done.

On my SKL machine, if I use i915.mmio_debug=999, this patch triggers
42 WARNs just by booting. I didn't investigate them yet. Normal users
are only going to get a single WARN due to the default i915.mmio_debug
setting.

Thank you for your comprehension,
Paulo
