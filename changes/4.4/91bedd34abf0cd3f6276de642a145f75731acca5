information is filled in intel_device_info and is available to user with

information is based on available counts but takes power gated slices
into account. It can be read in debugfs.

Broadwell.

  register instead of RPCS register

  sseu_device_satus functions

- Fix style issues

v4:
- Corrected comment
- Reverted reordering of defines
