platform/chrome: Fix i2c-designware adapter name

Commit d80d134182ba ("i2c: designware: Move common probe code into
i2c_dw_probe()") caused the I2C adapter lookup code here to fail for PCI
enumerated i2c-designware because commit changed the adapter name but
didn't update it here.

Fix the I2C adapter lookup by using the "Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter"
name.
