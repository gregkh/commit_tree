ocfs2/dlm: clear migration_pending when migration target goes down

We have found a BUG on res->migration_pending when migrating lock
resources.  The situation is as follows.

dlm_mark_lockres_migration
  res->migration_pending = 1;
  __dlm_lockres_reserve_ast
  dlm_lockres_release_ast returns with res->migration_pending remains
      because other threads reserve asts
  wait dlm_migration_can_proceed returns 1
  >>>>>>> o2hb found that target goes down and remove target
          from domain_map
  dlm_migration_can_proceed returns 1
  dlm_mark_lockres_migrating returns -ESHOTDOWN with
      res->migration_pending still remains.

When reentering dlm_mark_lockres_migrating(), it will trigger the BUG_ON
with res->migration_pending.  So clear migration_pending when target is
down.
