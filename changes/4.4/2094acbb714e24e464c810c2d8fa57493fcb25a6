net/ipv4: Pass proto as u8 instead of u16 in ip_check_mc_rcu

This patch updates ip_check_mc_rcu so that protocol is passed as a u8
instead of a u16.

The motivation is just to avoid any unneeded type transitions since some
systems will require an instruction to zero extend a u8 field to a u16.
Also it makes it a bit more readable as to the fact that protocol is a u8
so there are no byte ordering changes needed to pass it.
