mwifiex: Suppress -ENOSR error for data traffic on USB

We have preallocated buffer pool for Tx data. During high
data traffic, all buffers are submitted to USB and driver needs
to wait until one of the buffers get available for next Tx
packet.

"data: -ENOSR is returned" errors is expected in this case. Let's
lower the priority of this message.
