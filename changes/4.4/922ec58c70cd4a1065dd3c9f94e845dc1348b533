cfg80211: reg: remove useless reg_timeout scheduling

When the functions reg_set_rd_driver() and reg_set_rd_country_ie()
return with an error, the calling function already restores data
by calling restore_regulatory_settings(), so there's no need to
also schedule a timeout (which would lead to other side effects
such as indicating CRDA failed, which clearly isn't true.) Remove
the scheduling.
