Input: edt-ft5x06 - switch to newer gpio framework

The current/old gpio framework used doesn't properly listen to
ACTIVE_LOW and ACTIVE_HIGH flags. The newer gpio framework takes into
account these flags when setting gpio values.

Since the values being output were based on voltage and not logic they
change to reflect this difference. Also use gpiod_set_value_cansleep since
wake and reset pins can be provided by bus based io expanders.

Switch from msleep(5) to udelay_range(5000,6000) to avoid check patch
warning.
