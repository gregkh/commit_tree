cpufreq: CPPC: Initialize and check CPUFreq CPU co-ord type correctly

The CPU policy struct indicates the co-ordination type
for all CPUs of a common freq domain. Initialize it
correctly using the CPU specific data gathered from
CPPC ACPI lib via acpi_get_psd_map().

The PSD object is optional, so the cpu->shared_type
can also be 0. So instead of assuming any value other
than SW_ANY(0xFD) is unsupported, explictly check
if shared_type is SW_ALL and then bail.
