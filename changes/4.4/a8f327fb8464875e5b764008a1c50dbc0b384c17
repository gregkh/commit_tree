drm/i915: Clean up CHV lane soft reset programming

Currently we release the lane soft reset before lane stagger settings
have been programmed. I believe that means we don't actually do lane
staggering. So move the soft reset deassert to happen after lane
staggering has been programmed.

The one confusing thing in this is that when we remove the power down
override from the lanes, they power up with defaul register values,
which do not have the soft reset overrides enabled. And according to
some docs by default the data lane resets are tied to cmnreset. So that
would mean that lanes would come out of reset without staggering as
soon as the power down overrides are removed. But since we can't access
either the lane stagger register nor the soft reset override registers
until the lanes are powered on, we can't really do anything about it.
So let's just set the soft reset overrides as soon as the lane is
powered on and hope for the best.
