ALSA: firewire-lib: add data block processing layer for AM824 format

This commit adds data block processing layer for AM824 format. The new
layer initializes streaming layer with its value for fmt field.

Currently, most implementation of data block processing still remains
streaming layer. In later commits, these codes will be moved to the layer.
