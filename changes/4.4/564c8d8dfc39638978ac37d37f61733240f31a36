misc: mic: SCIF fence

This patch implements the fence APIs required to synchronize
DMAs. SCIF provides an interface to return a "mark" for all DMAs
programmed at the instant the API was called. Users can then "wait" on
the mark provided previously by blocking inside the kernel. Upon
receipt of a DMA completion interrupt the waiting thread is woken
up. There is also an interface to signal DMA completion by polling for
a location to be updated via a "signal" cookie to avoid the interrupt
overhead in the mark/wait interface. SCIF allows programming fences on
both the local and the remote node for both the mark/wait or the fence
signal APIs.
