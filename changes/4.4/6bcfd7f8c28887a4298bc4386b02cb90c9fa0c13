tcp: fix RFS vs lockless listeners

Before recent TCP listener patches, we were updating listener
sk->sk_rxhash before the cloning of master socket.

children sk_rxhash was therefore correct after the normal 3WHS.

But with lockless listener, we no longer dirty/change listener sk_rxhash
as it would be racy.

We need to correctly update the child sk_rxhash, otherwise first data
packet wont hit correct cpu if RFS is used.
