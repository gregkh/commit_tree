powerpc/vdso: Emit GNU & SysV hashes

Andy Lutomirski says:

  Some dynamic loaders may be slightly faster if a GNU hash is
  available.

  This is unlikely to have any measurable effect on the time it takes
  to resolve vdso symbols (since there are so few of them).  In some
  contexts, it can be a win for a different reason: if every DSO has a
  GNU hash section, then libc can avoid calculating SysV hashes at
  all. Both musl and glibc appear to have this optimization.
