Revert "rhashtable: Use __vmalloc with GFP_ATOMIC for table allocation"

This reverts commit d3716f18a7d841565c930efde30737a3557eee69.

vmalloc cannot be used in BH disabled contexts, even
with GFP_ATOMIC.  And we certainly want to support
rhashtable users inserting entries with software
interrupts disabled.
