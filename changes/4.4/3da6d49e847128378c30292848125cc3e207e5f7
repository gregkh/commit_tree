clocksource: Disallow drivers for ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET

We can now select clocksource drivers like ti-32k and CONFIG_OF
on ancient machines that still use gettimeoffset, and the combination
results in a link error.

arch/arm/kernel/built-in.o: In function `time_init':
(.init.text+0xc28): undefined reference to `clocksource_probe'

The reason for this is that the Makefile is hidden behind
CONFIG_ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET, but the Kconfig file is not, and
it has shown up just now because the ti-32k driver was added
and can be selected using COMPILE_TEST on all platforms.

This patch hides the Kconfig menu in CONFIG_ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET
as well.
