mtd: brcmnand: Fix pointer type-cast in brcmnand_write()

We should always type-cast pointer to "long" or "unsigned long"
because size of pointer is same as machine word size. This will
avoid pointer type-cast issues on both 32bit and 64bit systems.

This patch fixes pointer type-cast issue in brcmnand_write()
as-per above info.
