Fix remove_and_add_spares removes drive added as spare in slot_store

Commit 2910ff17d154baa5eb50e362a91104e831eb2bb6
introduced a regression which would remove a recently added spare via
slot_store. Revert part of the patch which touches slot_store() and add
the disk directly using pers->hot_add_disk()

rdev")
