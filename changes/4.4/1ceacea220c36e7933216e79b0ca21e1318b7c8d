gpio: Add GPIO support for the ACCES 104-IDIO-16

The ACCES 104-IDIO-16 family of PC/104 utility boards feature 16
optically isolated inputs and 16 optically isolated FET solid state
outputs. This driver provides GPIO support for these 32 channels of
digital I/O. Change-of-State detection interrupts are not supported.

GPIO 0-15 correspond to digital outputs 0-15, while GPIO 16-31
correspond to digital inputs 0-15. The base port address for the device
may be set via the idio_16_base module parameter.
