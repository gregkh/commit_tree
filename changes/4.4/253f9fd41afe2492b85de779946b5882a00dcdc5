raid5-cache: don't delay stripe captured in log

There is a case a stripe gets delayed forever.
1. a stripe finishes construction
2. a new bio hits the stripe
3. handle_stripe runs for the stripe. The stripe gets DELAYED bit set
since construction can't run for new bio (the stripe is locked since
step 1)

Without log, handle_stripe will call ops_run_io. After IO finishes, the
stripe gets unlocked and the stripe will restart and run construction
for the new bio. With log, ops_run_io need to run two times. If the
DELAYED bit set, the stripe can't enter into the handle_list, so the
second ops_run_io doesn't run, which leaves the stripe stalled.
