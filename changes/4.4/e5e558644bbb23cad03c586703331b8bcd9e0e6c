device property: Adding DMA Attribute APIs for Generic Devices

The function device_dma_is_coherent() does not sufficiently
communicate device DMA attributes. Instead, this patch introduces
device_get_dma_attr(), which returns enum dev_dma_attr.
It replaces the acpi_check_dma(), which will be removed in
subsequent patch.

This also provides a convenient function, device_dma_supported(),
to check DMA support of the specified device.
