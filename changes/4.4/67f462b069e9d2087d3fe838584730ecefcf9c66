serial: sh-sci: Get rid of the workqueue to handle receive DMA requests

The receive DMA workqueue function work_fn_rx() handles two things:
  1. Reception of a full buffer on completion of a receive DMA request,
  2. Reception of a partial buffer on receive DMA time-out.
The workqueue is kicked by both the receive DMA completion handler, and
by a timer to handle DMA time-out.

As there are always two receive DMA requests active, it's possible that
the receive DMA completion handler is called a second time before the
workqueue function runs.

As the time-out handler re-enables the receive interrupt, an interrupt
may come in before time-out has been fully handled.

Move part 1 into the receive DMA completion handler, and move part 2
into the receive DMA time-out handler, to fix these race conditions.
