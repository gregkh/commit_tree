clk: Allow drivers to build if COMPILE_TEST is enabled

These drivers only have runtime but no build time dependencies so can be
built for testing purposes if the Kconfig COMPILE_TEST option is enabled.

This is useful to have more build coverage and make sure that drivers are
not affected by changes that could cause build regressions.
