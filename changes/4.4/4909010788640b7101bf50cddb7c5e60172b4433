tracing: Add set_event_pid directory for future use

Create a tracing directory called set_event_pid, which currently has no
function, but will be used to filter all events for the tracing instance or
the pids that are added to the file.

The reason no functionality is added with this commit is that this commit
focuses on the creation and removal of the pids in a safe manner. And tests
can be made against this change to make sure things are correct before
hooking features to the list of pids.
