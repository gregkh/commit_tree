s390/cio: simplify css_generate_pgid

Simplify the css_generate_pgid code by using stap() independent of
CONFIG_SMP. For !CONFIG_SMP builds stap() will deliver the address
of the cpu we IPL'ed from (which can be != 0).

Note: the ifdef was likely added to be compatible with _very_ old
machines which we don't support anyway.
