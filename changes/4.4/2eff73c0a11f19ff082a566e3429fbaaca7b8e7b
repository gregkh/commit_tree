x86/microcode/amd: Extract current patch level read to a function

Pave the way for checking the current patch level of the
microcode in a core. We want to be able to do stuff depending on
the patch level - in this case decide whether to update or not.
But that will be added in a later patch.

Drop unused local var uci assignment, while at it.

Integrate a fix for 32-bit and CONFIG_PARAVIRT from Takashi Iwai:

 Use native_rdmsr() in check_current_patch_level() because with
 CONFIG_PARAVIRT enabled and on 32-bit, where we run before
 paging has been enabled, we cannot deref pv_info yet. Or we
 could, but we'd need to access its physical address. This way of
 fixing it is simpler. See:
