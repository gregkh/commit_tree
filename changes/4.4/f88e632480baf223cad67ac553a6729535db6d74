MIPS: Avoid buffer overrun in mips_cm_error_report

Commit 3885c2b463f6 ("MIPS: CM: Add support for reporting CM cache
errors") added cases for decoding errors reported by CM3, but leaves the
buf variable which is printed as a string uninitialised for cause values
other than 1, 2 or 3. Fix by ensuring the buf variable is initialised to
an empty string in such cases.
