net: Remove martian_source_keep_err goto label

err is initialized to -EINVAL when it is declared. It is not reset until
fib_lookup which is well after the 3 users of the martian_source jump. So
resetting err to -EINVAL at martian_source label is not needed.

Removing that line obviates the need for the martian_source_keep_err label
so delete it.
