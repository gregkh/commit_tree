PM / clk: Fix broken build due to non-matching code and header #ifdefs

If an architecture's main Kconfig file doesn't include
kernel/power/Kconfig, but CONFIG_PM=y and HAVE_CLK=y (e.g. m68knommu
allmodconfig):

This happens because:
  - drivers/base/power/clock_ops.c depends on CONFIG_HAVE_CLK,
  - the failing code inside clock_ops.c additionally depends on
    CONFIG_PM,
  - the forward declarations and other definitions in <linux/pm_clock.h>
    depend on CONFIG_PM_CLK,
  - CONFIG_PM_CLK is defined as PM && HAVE_CLK in kernel/power/Kconfig,
    but it is not included on all architectures.

Fix this by protecting the failing code inside clock_ops.c by
CONFIG_PM_CLK instead of CONFIG_PM, so it matches <linux/pm_clock.h>.
