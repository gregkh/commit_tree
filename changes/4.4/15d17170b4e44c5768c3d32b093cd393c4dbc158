NFC: st21nfca: Add support for proprietary commands

Add support for proprietary commands useful mainly
for factory testings.

Here is a list:

- FACTORY_MODE: Allow to set the driver into a mode where no
  secure element are activated. It does not consider any
  NFC_ATTR_VENDOR_DATA.
- HCI_CLEAR_ALL_PIPES: Allow to execute a HCI clear all pipes
  command. It does not consider any NFC_ATTR_VENDOR_DATA.
- HCI_DM_PUT_DATA: Allow to configure specific CLF registry as
  for example RF trimmings or low level drivers configurations
  (I2C, SPI, SWP).
- HCI_DM_UPDATE_AID: Allow to configure an AID routing into the
  CLF routing table following RF technology, CLF mode or protocol.
- HCI_DM_GET_INFO: Allow to retrieve CLF information.
- HCI_DM_GET_DATA: Allow to retrieve CLF configurable data such as
  low level drivers configurations or RF trimmings.
- HCI_DM_LOAD: Allow to load a firmware into the CLF. A complete
  packet can be more than 8KB.
- HCI_DM_RESET: Allow to run a CLF reset in order to "commit" CLF
  configuration changes without CLF power off.
- HCI_GET_PARAM: Allow to retrieve an HCI CLF parameter (for example
  the white list).
- HCI_DM_FIELD_GENERATOR: Allow to generate different kind of RF
  technology. When using this command to anti-collision is done.
- HCI_LOOPBACK: Allow to echo a command and test the Dh to CLF
  connectivity.
