i2c: designware: reverts "i2c: designware: Add support for AMD I2C controller"

The patch reverts commit a445900c9060 (i2c: designware: Add support for
AMD I2C controller). It never worked anyhow because it did not register
a proper clkdev.

Since kernel 4.1 starts to support APD, there is no need to get freq
from id->driver_data for AMD0010. clkdev is supposed to be already
registered in APD.

So, revert old design and make AMD0010 looks like other ones.
