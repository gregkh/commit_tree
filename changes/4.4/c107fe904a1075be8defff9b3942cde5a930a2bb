ARM: S3C24XX: Use PWM lookup table for mach-rx1950

Use a PWM lookup table to provide the PWM to the pwm-backlight device.
The driver has a legacy code path that is required only because boards
still use the legacy method of requesting PWMs by global ID. Replacing
these usages allows that legacy fallback to be removed.
