xfs: pass xfsstats structures to handlers and macros

This patch is the next step toward per-fs xfs stats. The patch makes
the show and clear routines able to handle any stats structure
associated with a kobject.

Instead of a single global xfsstats structure, add kobject and a pointer
to a per-cpu struct xfsstats. Modify the macros that manipulate the stats
accordingly: XFS_STATS_INC, XFS_STATS_DEC, and XFS_STATS_ADD now access
xfsstats->xs_stats.

The sysfs functions need to get from the kobject back to the xfsstats
structure which contains it, and pass the pointer to the ->xs_stats
percpu structure into the show & clear routines.
