mtd: brcmnand: Force 8bit mode before doing nand_scan_ident()

Just like other NAND controllers, the NAND READID command only works
in 8bit mode for all versions of BRCMNAND controller.

This patch forces 8bit mode for each NAND CS in brcmnand_init_cs()
before doing nand_scan_ident() to ensure that BRCMNAND controller
is in 8bit mode when NAND READID command is issued.
