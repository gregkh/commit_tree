ath10k: override CE5 configuration for QCA6147 device

Commit a70587b3389a ("ath10k: configure copy engine 5 for HTT messages")
introduced to use the unused CE5 for target to host message. For the device
like QCA6174, CE5 already assigned for other feature. So for QCA6174, override
the CE5 configuration and use the CE1 instead.

This patch is based on Rajkumar's earlier patch.
