rcu: Finish folding ->fqs_state into ->gp_state

Commit commit 4cdfc175c25c89ee ("rcu: Move quiescent-state forcing
into kthread") started the process of folding the old ->fqs_state into
->gp_state, but did not complete it.  This situation does not cause
any malfunction, but can result in extremely confusing trace output.
This commit completes this task of eliminating ->fqs_state in favor
of ->gp_state.

The old ->fqs_state was also used to decide when to collect dyntick-idle
snapshots.  For this purpose, we add a boolean variable into the kthread,
which is set on the first call to rcu_gp_fqs() for a given grace period
and clear otherwise.
