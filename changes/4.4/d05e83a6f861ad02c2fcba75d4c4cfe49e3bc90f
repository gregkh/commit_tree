memcg: simplify charging kmem pages

Charging kmem pages proceeds in two steps.  First, we try to charge the
allocation size to the memcg the current task belongs to, then we allocate
a page and "commit" the charge storing the pointer to the memcg in the
page struct.

Such a design looks overcomplicated, because there is not much sense in
trying charging the allocation before actually allocating a page: we won't
be able to consume much memory over the limit even if we charge after
doing the actual allocation, besides we already charge user pages post
factum, so being pedantic with kmem pages just looks pointless.

So this patch simplifies the design by merging the "charge" and the
"commit" steps into the same function, which takes the allocated page.

Also, rename the charge and uncharge methods to memcg_kmem_charge and
memcg_kmem_uncharge and make the charge method return error code instead
of bool to conform to mem_cgroup_try_charge.
