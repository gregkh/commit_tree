thp: remove unused vma parameter from khugepaged_alloc_page

The "vma" parameter to khugepaged_alloc_page() is unused.  It has to
remain unused or the drop read lock 'map_sem' optimisation introduce by
commit 8b1645685acf ("mm, THP: don't hold mmap_sem in khugepaged when
allocating THP") wouldn't be safe.  So let's remove it.
