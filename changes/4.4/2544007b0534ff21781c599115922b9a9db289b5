drivers/char: make SGI snsc.c driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this driver is currently:

config SGI_SNSC
    bool "SGI Altix system controller communication support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove all modular references, so that when reading the driver
there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.
