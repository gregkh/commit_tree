ASoC: rt5645: Add jd_invert for Broadwell

Broadwell can not triger the IRQ falling and rising simultaneously,
so it can not detect jack-in and jack-out simultaneously.
We add a flag "jd_invert" to platform data. If this flag is set,
codec IRQ will be set to invert that forces IRQ as pulse when jack-in
and jack-out.
