rtc: pcf2127: fix reading uninitialized value on RTC_READ_VL ioctl

The flag reported on the RTC_READ_VL ioctl is only initialized when the
date is read out. So the voltage low value doesn't represent reality but
the status at the time the date was read (or 0 if the date was not read
yet).

Moreover when userspace requests a value via an ioctl there is no added
benefit to also make a prosa representation of this (and other) values
appear in the kernel log so remove the calls to dev_info and the driver
data members to track their state.
