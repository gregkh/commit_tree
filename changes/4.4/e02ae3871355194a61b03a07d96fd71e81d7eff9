x86/x2apic: Make stub functions available even if !CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC

Some CONFIG_X86_X2APIC functions, especially x2apic_enabled(), are not
declared if !CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC.  However, the same stubs that work
for !CONFIG_X86_X2APIC are okay even if there is no local APIC support
at all.

Avoid the introduction of #ifdefs by moving the x2apic declarations
completely outside the CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC block.  (Unfortunately,
diff generation messes up the actual change that this patch makes).
There is no semantic change because CONFIG_X86_X2APIC depends on
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC.
