rtc: ds1307: fix kernel splat due to wakeup irq handling

Since commit 3fffd1283927 ("i2c: allow specifying
separate wakeup interrupt in device tree") we have
automatic wakeup irq support for i2c devices. That
commit missed the fact that rtc-1307 had its own
wakeup irq handling and ended up introducing a
kernel splat for at least Beagle x15 boards.

Fix that by reverting original commit _and_ passing
correct interrupt names on DTS so i2c-core can
choose correct IRQ as wakeup.

Now that we have automatic wakeirq support, we can
revert the original commit which did it manually.

Fixes the following warning:
