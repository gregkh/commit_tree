ARM: 8464/1: Update all mm structures with section adjustments

Currently, when updating section permissions to mark areas RO
or NX, the only mm updated is current->mm. This is working off
the assumption that there are no additional mm structures at
the time. This may not always hold true. (Example: calling
modprobe early will trigger a fork/exec). Ensure all mm structres
get updated with the new section information.
