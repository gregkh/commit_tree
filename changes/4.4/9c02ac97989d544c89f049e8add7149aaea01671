ext4: fix xfstest generic/269 double revoked buffer bug with bigalloc

When you repeatly execute xfstest generic/269 with bigalloc_1k option
enabled using the below command:

"./kvm-xfstests -c bigalloc_1k -m nodelalloc -C 1000 generic/269"

you can easily see the below bug message.

"JBD2 unexpected failure: jbd2_journal_revoke: !buffer_revoked(bh);"

This means that an already revoked buffer is erroneously revoked again
and it is caused by doing revoke for the buffer at the wrong position
in ext4_free_blocks(). We need to re-position the buffer revoke
procedure for an unspecified buffer after checking the cluster boundary
for bigalloc option. If not, some part of the cluster can be doubly
revoked.
