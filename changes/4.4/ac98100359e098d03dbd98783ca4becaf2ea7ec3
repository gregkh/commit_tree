fm10k: Only trigger data path reset if fabric is up

This change makes it so that we only trigger the data path reset if the
fabric is ready to handle traffic.  The general idea is to avoid
triggering the reset unless the switch API is ready for us.  Otherwise
we can just postpone the reset until we receive a switch ready
notification.
