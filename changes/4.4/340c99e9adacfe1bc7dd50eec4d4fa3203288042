be2iscsi: Fix updating the next pointer during WRB posting

While posting WRB the next_pointer of the current WRB should point
to itself and the previous WRB next_pointer should point to the
current WRB.

The next pointer value was retrieved during alloc_pdu and was updated
in wrb before ringing the doorbell. The fix retrieves the
next_pointer just before ringing the doorbell and updates in the WRB.
