mtd: ubi: fixup error correction in do_sync_erase()

Since fastmap we gained do_sync_erase(). This function can return an error
and its error handling isn't obvious. First the memory allocation for
struct ubi_work can fail and as such struct ubi_wl_entry is leaked.
However if the memory allocation succeeds then the tail function takes
care of the struct ubi_wl_entry. A free here could result in a double
free.
To make the error handling simpler, I split the tail function into one
piece which does the work and another which frees the struct ubi_work
which is passed as argument. As result do_sync_erase() can keep the
struct on stack and we get rid of one error source.
