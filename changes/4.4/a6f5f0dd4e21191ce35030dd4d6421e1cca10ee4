PM / sleep: Report interrupt that caused system wakeup

Add a sysfs attribute, /sys/power/pm_wakeup_irq, reporting the IRQ
number of the first wakeup interrupt (that is, the first interrupt
from an IRQ line armed for system wakeup) seen by the kernel during
the most recent system suspend/resume cycle.

This feature will be useful for system wakeup diagnostics of
spurious wakeup interrupts.
