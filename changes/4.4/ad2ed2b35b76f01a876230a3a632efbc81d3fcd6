cgroup: move check_for_release() invocation

To trigger release agent when the last task leaves the cgroup,
check_for_release() is called from put_css_set_locked(); however,
css_set being unlinked is being decoupled from task leaving the cgroup
and the correct condition to test is cgroup->nr_populated dropping to
zero which check_for_release() is already updated to test.

This patch moves check_for_release() invocation from
put_css_set_locked() to cgroup_update_populated().
