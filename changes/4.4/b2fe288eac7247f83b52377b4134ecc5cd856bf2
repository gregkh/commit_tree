NFC: nfcmrvl: free reset gpio

Reset GPIO shall be freed by the driver since the device used
in devm_ calls can be still valid on unregister.

If user removes the module and inserts it again, the devm_gpio_request
will fail because the underlying physical device (e.g i2c) was not
removed so the device management won't have freed the gpio.
