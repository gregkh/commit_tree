KVM: introduce kvm_arch functions for IRQ bypass

This patch introduces
- kvm_arch_irq_bypass_add_producer
- kvm_arch_irq_bypass_del_producer
- kvm_arch_irq_bypass_stop
- kvm_arch_irq_bypass_start

They make possible to specialize the KVM IRQ bypass consumer in
case CONFIG_KVM_HAVE_IRQ_BYPASS is set.
