ceph: combine as many iovec as possile into one OSD request

Both ceph_sync_direct_write and ceph_sync_read iterate iovec elements
one by one, send one OSD request for each iovec. This is sub-optimal,
We can combine serveral iovec into one page vector, and send an OSD
request for the whole page vector.
