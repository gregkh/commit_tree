Staging: rtl8192u: ieee80211_rx: Remove unnecessary code

The variable frame_authorized is declared and mentioned in the code but
is not used anywhere so, it should be removed. Also, two case statements
are merged by removing an extra break.
Semantic patch used:
@@
type T;
identifier i;
constant C;
position p != e.p;

- T i@p;
