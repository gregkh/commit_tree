[media] media: vb2 dma-contig: Fully cache synchronise buffers in prepare and finish

In videobuf2 dma-contig memory type the prepare and finish ops, instead of
passing the number of entries in the original scatterlist as the "nents"
parameter to dma_sync_sg_for_device() and dma_sync_sg_for_cpu(), the value
returned by dma_map_sg() was used. Albeit this has been suggested in
comments of some implementations (which have since been corrected), this
is wrong.

Fixes: 199d101efdba ("v4l: vb2-dma-contig: add prepare/finish to dma-contig allocator")
