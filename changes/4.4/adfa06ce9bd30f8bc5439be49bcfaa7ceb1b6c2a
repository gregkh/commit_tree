ARM: dts: sun5i: Add dts file for the Wobo i5 top set box

The Wobo i5 top set box is a somewhat curious A10s based top set box,
it uses an AXP209 rather then the AXP152 usually used in combination
with the A10s. It has an ethernet phy connected to PORTD rather then
PORTA, and its built-in usb wifi is connected via the otg controller.

This commit adds a dts file adding support for this top set box.
