tracefs: Fix refcount imbalance in start_creating()

In tracefs' start_creating(), we pin the file system to safely access
its root. When we failed to create a file, we unpin the file system via
failed_creating() to release the mount count and eventually the reference
of the singleton vfsmount.

However, when we run into an error during lookup_one_len() when still
in start_creating(), we only release the parent's mutex but not so the
reference on the mount.

F.e., in securityfs_create_file(), after doing simple_pin_fs() when
lookup_one_len() fails there, we infact do simple_release_fs(). This
seems necessary here as well.

Same issue seen in debugfs due to 190afd81e4a5 ("debugfs: split the
beginning and the end of __create_file() off"), which seemed to got
carried over into tracefs, too. Noticed during code review.
