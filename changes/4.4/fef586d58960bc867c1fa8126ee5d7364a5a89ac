ALSA: bebob: use correct type for __be32 data

In former commit, metering is supported for BeBoB based models
customized by M-Audio. The data in transaction is aligned to
big-endianness, while in the driver code u16 typed variable is assigned
to the data. This causes sparse warnings.

bebob_maudio.c:651:31: warning: cast to restricted __be16
bebob_maudio.c:651:31: warning: cast to restricted __be16
bebob_maudio.c:651:31: warning: cast to restricted __be16
bebob_maudio.c:651:31: warning: cast to restricted __be16

This commit fixes this bug by using __be16 variable for the data.
