staging: wilc1000: wilc_handle_isr: add argument wilc to wilc_handle_isr

This patch add new argument wilc to wilc_handle_isr and pass wilc to
the function.
It is void type for now because wilc_wlan.c was implemented platform
independently at the beginning (linux_wlan.c is implementation of LINUX part),
so the header file which defines struct wilc cannot be included at this moment,
but this driver is dedicated to LINUX so wilc_wlan.c and linux_wlan.c will be
merged. After that, this void type will be changed with struct wilc as well as
other functions which are using void type in wilc_wlan.h.
