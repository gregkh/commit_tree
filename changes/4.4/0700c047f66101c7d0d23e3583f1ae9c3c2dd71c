ACPI / EC: Fix query handler related issues

1. acpi_ec_remove_query_handlers()
This patch refines the query handler removal logic implemented in
acpi_ec_remove_query_handler(), making it to invoke new
acpi_ec_remove_query_handlers() API, and ensuring all other removal code
paths to invoke the new API to honor the reference count of the query
handlers.

2. acpi_ec_get_query_handler_by_value()
This patch also refines the query handler search logic originally
implemented in acpi_ec_query(), collecting it into
acpi_ec_get_query_handler_by_value(). And since schedule_work() can ensure
the serilization of acpi_ec_event_handler(), we needn't put the
mutex_lock() around schedule_work().
