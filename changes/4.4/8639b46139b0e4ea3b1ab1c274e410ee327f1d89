pidns: fix set/getpriority and ioprio_set/get in PRIO_USER mode

setpriority(PRIO_USER, 0, x) will change the priority of tasks outside of
the current pid namespace.  This is in contrast to both the other modes of
setpriority and the example of kill(-1).  Fix this.  getpriority and
ioprio have the same failure mode, fix them too.

: After some more thinking about it this patch sounds justifiable.

: My goal with namespaces is not to build perfect isolation mechanisms

: a single namespace with well defined results.

: In this case you have found the two interfaces I am aware of that
: identify processes by uid instead of by pid.  Which quite frankly is
: weird.  Unfortunately the weird unexpected cases are hard to handle
: in the usual way.

: I was hoping for a little more information.  Changes like this one we

: behavior.  I don't think they are and I do think this make sense as part
: of the pid namespace.
