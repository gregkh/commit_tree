staging: comedi: unioxx5: remove this flawed driver

I was going to clean up this driver but looking it over it has a
number of serious flaws. Also, Fastwell published an End-Of-Life
notification for the board on 24/Jan/2014 (End-of-sale 30/Jun/2014,
End-of-delivery 30/Dec/2014).

Since the driver has a comedi driver status of "unkown", lets just
remove the driver instead of trying to fix the flaws.
