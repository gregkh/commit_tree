clk: qcom: Move gdsc config outside COMMON_CLK_QCOM config

Having this hidden config below the COMMON_CLK_QCOM config causes
menuconfig to stop indenting config items after it.

        <*> Support for Qualcomm's clock controllers
        {M}   APQ8084 Global Clock Controller
        <M>   APQ8084 Multimedia Clock Controller
        {M}   IPQ806x Global Clock Controller
        <M>   IPQ806x LPASS Clock Controller
        <M> MSM8660 Global Clock Controller
        <M> MSM8916 Global Clock Controller
        {M} APQ8064/MSM8960 Global Clock Controller
        <M> APQ8064/MSM8960 LPASS Clock Controller
        <M> MSM8960 Multimedia Clock Controller
        {M} MSM8974 Global Clock Controller
        <M> MSM8974 Multimedia Clock Controller

Move it up above anything else so that we don't get odd
indenting.
