Revert "usb: dwc3: gadget: drop unnecessary loop when cleaning up TRBs"

This reverts commit 8f2c9544aba636134303105ecb164190a39dece4.

As it breaks g_ether on my Baytrail FFRD8 device. Everything starts out
fine, but after a bit of data has been transferred it just stops
flowing.

Note that I do get a bunch of these "NOHZ: local_softirq_pending 08"
when booting the machine, but I'm not really sure if they're related
to this problem.
