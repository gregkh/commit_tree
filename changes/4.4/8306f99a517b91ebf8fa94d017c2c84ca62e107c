tipc: disallow packet duplicates in link deferred queue

After the previous commits, we are guaranteed that no packets
of type LINK_PROTOCOL or with illegal sequence numbers will be
attempted added to the link deferred queue. This makes it possible to
make some simplifications to the sorting algorithm in the function
tipc_skb_queue_sorted().

We also alter the function so that it will drop packets if one with
the same seqeunce number is already present in the queue. This is
necessary because we have identified weird packet sequences, involving
duplicate packets, where a legitimate in-sequence packet may advance to
the head of the queue without being detected and de-queued.

Finally, we make this function outline, since it will now be called only
in exceptional cases.
