drm/i915: check for the supported strides on HSW+ FBC

Don't allow FBC for cases where the spec says we can't FBC.

v2:
  - Just WARN_ON() the strides that should have been caught earlier
    (Daniel)
  - Make it a new function since I expect this to grow more.
v3:
  - Document which IGT test is exercised by this.
v4:
  - Implement the restrictions for gens 2-6 too (Ville).
  - Fix off-by-one mistake (Ville).
