s390/spinlock: use correct barriers

_raw_write_lock_wait first sets the high order bit to indicate a
pending writer and then waits for the reader to drop to zero.
smp_rmb by definition only orders reads against reads. Let's use
a full smp_mb instead. As right now smp_rmb is implemented
as full serialization, this needs no stable backport, but this
patch will be necessary if we reimplement smp_rmb.
