perf intel-pt: Support generating branch stack

Add support for generating branch stack context for PT samples.  The
decoder reports a configurable number of branches as branch context for
each sample. Internally it keeps track of them by using a simple sliding
window.  We also flush the last branch buffer on each sample to avoid
overlapping intervals.

This is useful for:

- Reporting accurate basic block edge frequencies through the perf
  report branch view
- Using with --branch-history to get the wider context of samples
- Other users of LBRs

Also the Documentation is updated.

Examples:

	Record with Intel PT:

		perf record -e intel_pt//u ls

	Branch stacks are used by default if synthesized so:

		perf report --itrace=ile

	is the same as:

		perf report --itrace=ile -b

	Branch history can be requested also:

		perf report --itrace=igle --branch-history
