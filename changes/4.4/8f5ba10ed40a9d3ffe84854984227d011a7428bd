How about the patch below ? In that version of the ib_sg_to_pages() fix
these concerns have been addressed and additionally to more bugs have been fixed.

------------

[PATCH] IB core: Fix ib_sg_to_pages()

Fix the code for detecting gaps. A gap occurs not only if the
second or later scatterlist element is not aligned but also if
any scatterlist element other than the last does not end at a
page boundary.

In the code for coalescing contiguous elements, ensure that
mr->length is correct and that last_page_addr is up-to-date.

Ensure that this function returns a negative
error code instead of zero if the first set_page() call fails.

Fixes: commit 4c67e2bfc8b7 ("IB/core: Introduce new fast registration API")
