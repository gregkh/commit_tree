pwm: Set enable state properly on failed call to enable

The pwm_enable() function didn't clear the enabled bit if a call to the
driver's ->enable() callback returned an error. The result was that the
state of the PWM core was wrong. Clearing the bit when enable returns
an error ensures the state is properly set.
