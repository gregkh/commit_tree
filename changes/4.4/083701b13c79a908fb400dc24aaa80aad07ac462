cpufreq: ondemand: Drop unnecessary locks from update_sampling_rate()

'timer_mutex' is required to sync work-handlers of policy->cpus.
update_sampling_rate() is just canceling the works and queuing them
again. This isn't protecting anything at all in update_sampling_rate()
and is not gonna be of any use.

Even if a work-handler is already running for a CPU,
cancel_delayed_work_sync() will wait for it to finish.

Drop these unnecessary locks.
