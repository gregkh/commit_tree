drivers/staging: make android timed_output.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/staging/android/Kconfig:config ANDROID_TIMED_OUTPUT
drivers/staging/android/Kconfig:        bool "Timed output class driver"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We replace module.h with init.h and export.h ; the latter since this
file does actually export some symbols.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
