ebpf: include perf_event only where really needed

Commit ea317b267e9d ("bpf: Add new bpf map type to store the pointer
to struct perf_event") added perf_event.h to the main eBPF header, so
it gets included for all users. perf_event.h is actually only needed
from array map side, so lets sanitize this a bit.
