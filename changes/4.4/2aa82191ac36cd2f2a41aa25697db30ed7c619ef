md-cluster: Perform a lazy update

In a clustered environment, a change such as marking a device faulty,
can be recorded by any of the nodes. This is communicated to all the
nodes and re-recording such a change is unnecessary, and quite often
pretty disruptive.

With this patch, just before the update, we detect for the changes
and if the changes are already in superblock, we abort the update
after clearing all the flags
