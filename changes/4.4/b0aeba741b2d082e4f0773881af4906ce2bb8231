Fix alloc_node_mem_map() to work on ia64 again

In commit a1c34a3bf00a ("mm: Don't offset memmap for flatmem") Laura
fixed a problem for Srinivas relating to the bottom 2MB of RAM on an ARM
IFC6410 board.

One small wrinkle on ia64 is that it allocates the node_mem_map earlier
in arch code, so it skips the block of code where "offset" is
initialized.

Move initialization of start and offset before the check for the
node_mem_map so that they will always be available in the latter part of
the function.
