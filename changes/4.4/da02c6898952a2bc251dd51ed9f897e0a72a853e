btrfs: fix clashing number of the enhanced balance usage filter

I've accidentally picked an already used number for the enhanced usage
filter represented by BTRFS_BALANCE_ARGS_USAGE_RANGE, clashing with
BTRFS_BALANCE_ARGS_CONVERT. Introduced during the development phase,
no backward compatibility issues.
