vfio/type1: handle case where IOMMU does not support PAGE_SIZE size

Current vfio_pgsize_bitmap code hides the supported IOMMU page
sizes smaller than PAGE_SIZE. As a result, in case the IOMMU
does not support PAGE_SIZE page, the alignment check on map/unmap
is done with larger page sizes, if any. This can fail although
mapping could be done with pages smaller than PAGE_SIZE.

This patch modifies vfio_pgsize_bitmap implementation so that,
in case the IOMMU supports page sizes smaller than PAGE_SIZE
we pretend PAGE_SIZE is supported and hide sub-PAGE_SIZE sizes.
That way the user will be able to map/unmap buffers whose size/
start address is aligned with PAGE_SIZE. Pinning code uses that
granularity while iommu driver can use the sub-PAGE_SIZE size
to map the buffer.
