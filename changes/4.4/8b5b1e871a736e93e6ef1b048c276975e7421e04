cxlflash: Correct usage of scsi_host_put()

Currently, scsi_host_put() is being called prematurely in the
remove path and is missing entirely in an error cleanup path.
The former can lead to memory being freed too early with
subsequent access potentially corrupting data whilst the former
would result in a memory leak.

Move the usage on remove to be the last cleanup action taken
and introduce a call to scsi_host_put() in the one initialization
error path that does not use remove to cleanup.
