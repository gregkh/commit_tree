ip: constify ip_build_and_send_pkt() socket argument

This function is used to build and send SYNACK packets,
possibly on behalf of unlocked listener socket.

Make sure we did not miss a write by making this socket const.

We no longer can use ip_select_ident() and have to either
set iph->id to 0 or directly call __ip_select_ident()
