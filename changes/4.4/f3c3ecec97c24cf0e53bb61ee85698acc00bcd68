[media] v4l2: rename V4L2_TUNER_ADC to V4L2_TUNER_SDR

SDR receiver has ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and SDR transmitter
has DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). Originally I though it could
be good idea to have own type for receiver and transmitter, but now I
feel one common type for SDR is enough. So lets rename it.
