arm: berlin: use non-self-cleared reset register to reset cpu

In Berlin SoCs, there are two kinds of cpu reset control registers: the
first one's corresponding bits will be self-cleared after some cycles,
while the second one's bits won't. Previously the first kind of reset
control register is used, this patch uses the second kind one to prepare
for the next hotplug commit.
