recordmcount: arm64: Replace the ignored mcount call into nop

By now, the recordmcount only records the function that in
following sections:
.text/.ref.text/.sched.text/.spinlock.text/.irqentry.text/
.kprobes.text/.text.unlikely

For the function that not in these sections, the call mcount
will be in place and not be replaced when kernel boot up. And
it will bring performance overhead, such as do_mem_abort (in
.exception.text section). This patch make the call mcount to
nop for this case in recordmcount.
