mm: page migration avoid touching newpage until no going back

We have had trouble in the past from the way in which page migration's
newpage is initialized in dribs and drabs - see commit 8bdd63809160 ("mm:
fix direct reclaim writeback regression") which proposed a cleanup.

We have no actual problem now, but I think the procedure would be clearer
(and alternative get_new_page pools safer to implement) if we assert that
newpage is not touched until we are sure that it's going to be used -
except for taking the trylock on it in __unmap_and_move().

So shift the early initializations from move_to_new_page() into
migrate_page_move_mapping(), mapping and NULL-mapping paths.  Similarly
migrate_huge_page_move_mapping(), but its NULL-mapping path can just be
deleted: you cannot reach hugetlbfs_migrate_page() with a NULL mapping.

Adjust stages 3 to 8 in the Documentation file accordingly.
