MD: set journal disk ->raid_disk

Set journal disk ->raid_disk to >=0, I choose raid_disks + 1 instead of
0, because we already have a disk with ->raid_disk 0 and this causes
sysfs entry creation conflict. A lot of places assumes disk with
->raid_disk >=0 is normal raid disk, so we add check for journal disk.
