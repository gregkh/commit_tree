i2c / ACPI: Rework I2C device scanning

The way we currently scan I2C devices behind an I2C host controller does not
work in cases where the I2C device in question is not declared directly below
the host controller ACPI node.

This is perfectly legal according the ACPI 6.0 specification and some existing
systems are doing this.

To be able to enumerate all devices which are connected to a certain I2C host
controller we need to rework the current I2C scanning routine a bit. Instead of
scanning directly below the host controller we scan the whole ACPI namespace
for present devices with valid I2cSerialBus() connection pointing to the host
controller in question.
