drm/i915: revert a few more watermark commits

This is a squash of the following commits:

Revert "drm/i915: Drop intel_update_sprite_watermarks"
This reverts commit 47c99438b52d12df50e182583634a4cfede3c920.

Revert "drm/i915/ivb: Move WaCxSRDisabledForSpriteScaling w/a to atomic check"
This reverts commit 7809e5ae35b9d8d0710f0874b2e3f10be144e38b.

Revert "drm/i915/skl: Eliminate usage of pipe_wm_parameters from SKL-style WM (v3)"
This reverts commit 3a05f5e2e78eab7ffe816abb59b6769e331a1957.

With these reverts, SKL finally stops failing every single FBC test
with FIFO underrun error messages. After some brief testing, it also
seems that this commit prevents the machine from completely freezing
when we run igt/kms_fbc_crc (see fd.o #92355).
