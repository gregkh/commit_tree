mm: page migration use the put_new_page whenever necessary

I don't know of any problem from the way it's used in our current tree,
but there is one defect in page migration's custom put_new_page feature.

An unused newpage is expected to be released with the put_new_page(), but
there was one MIGRATEPAGE_SUCCESS (0) path which released it with
putback_lru_page(): which can be very wrong for a custom pool.

Fixed more easily by resetting put_new_page once it won't be needed, than
by adding a further flag to modify the rc test.
