RDMA/nes: Support the new memory registration API

Support the new memory registration API by allocating a
private page list array in nes_mr and populate it when
nes_map_mr_sg is invoked. Also, support IB_WR_REG_MR
by duplicating IB_WR_FAST_REG_MR handling and take the
needed information from different places:
- page_size, iova, length (ib_mr)
- page array (nes_mr)
- key, access flags (ib_reg_wr)

The IB_WR_FAST_REG_MR handlers will be removed later when
all the ULPs will be converted.
