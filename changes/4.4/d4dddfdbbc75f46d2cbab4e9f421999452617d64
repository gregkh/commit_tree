arm64/efi: remove /chosen/linux, uefi-stub-kern-ver DT property

With the stub to kernel interface being promoted to a proper interface
so that other agents than the stub can boot the kernel proper in EFI
mode, we can remove the linux,uefi-stub-kern-ver field, considering
that its original purpose was to prevent this from happening in the
first place.
