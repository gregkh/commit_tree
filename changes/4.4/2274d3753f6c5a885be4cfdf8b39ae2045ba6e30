sh_eth: uninline sh_eth_{write|read}()

Commit 3365711df024 ("sh_eth: WARN on access to a register not implemented in
in  a particular chip") added WARN_ON() to sh_eth_{read|write}(), thus making
it  unacceptable for these functions to be *inline* anymore. Remove *inline*
and move the functions from the header to the driver itself. Below   is our
code economy with ARM gcc 4.7.3:

$ size drivers/net/ethernet/renesas/sh_eth.o{~,}
