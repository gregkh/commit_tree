ARM: tegra: colibri: Improve comment about thermal alert pin

Improve the comment about the THERMD_ALERT# pin which is the unlatched
I2C address pin of the LM95245 temperature sensor and therefore
requires disabling for now otherwise it won't get detected properly.

While at it also move that pin further down to have it alphabetically
sorted again.
