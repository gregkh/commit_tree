staging/rdma/hfi1: Wrong cast breaks desired pointer arithmetic

The address being mapped into a process's memory for notification events was
improperly calculated due to cast that was happening too early. dd->events is a
pointer and should have been casted to unsigned long after the pointer
arithmetic was done, not before.

As a result, processes were looking at the wrong place and not seeing their
notification events.
