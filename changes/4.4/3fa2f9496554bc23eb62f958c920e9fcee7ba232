ARM: dts: vfxxx: Fix erroneous property in esdhc0 node

Something seems to have gone wrong during the merging of the device
tree changes with the following patch

"ARM: dts: add property for maximum ADC clock frequencies"

The property "fsl,adck-max-frequency" instead of being applied for
the ADC1 node got applied to the esdhc0 node. This patch fixes it.
