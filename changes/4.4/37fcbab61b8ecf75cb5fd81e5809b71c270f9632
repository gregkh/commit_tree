ipv4: Only compute net once in ip_call_ra_chain

ip_call_ra_chain is called early in the forwarding chain from
ip_forward and ip_mr_input, which makes skb->dev the correct
expression to get the input network device and dev_net(skb->dev) a
correct expression for the network namespace the packet is being
processed in.

Compute the network namespace and store it in a variable to make the
code clearer.
