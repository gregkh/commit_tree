arm64: Make 36-bit VA depend on EXPERT

Commit 215399392fe4 (arm64: 36 bit VA) introduced 36-bit VA support for
the arm64 kernel when the 16KB page configuration is enabled. While this
is a valid hardware configuration, it's not something we want to
encourage since it reduces the memory (and I/O) range that the kernel
can access. Make this depend on EXPERT to avoid complaints of Linux not
mapping the whole RAM, especially on platforms following the ARM
recommended memory map.
