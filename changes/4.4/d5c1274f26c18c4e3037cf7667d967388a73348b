ARM: dts: sun5i: Add sun5i-q8-common.dtsi

This is the sun5i / a13 version of sun8i-q8-common.dtsi for use in dts
files for a13 q8 based tablets. Compared to sun8i this uses uart1 for the
serial console, and PG0 for card-detect for mmc0.

This also adds pmic and otg support, which both use the same config on
all known q8 a13 devices. This is not present in sun5i-q8-common.dtsi
because pmic / otg support for sun8i has not yet been merged.
