Creating a common structure initialization pattern for struct option

This patch tries to creates a common structure initialization
within the cpupower tool.

Previously the ``struct option`` was initialized
using `designated initializer` technique which was
not needed. There were conflicting initialization methods seen with

bench/main.c & others.
