drm/dp: Use I2C_WRITE_STATUS_UPDATE to drain partial I2C_WRITE requests

When an i2c WRITE gets an i2c defer or short i2c ack reply, we are
supposed to switch the request from I2C_WRITE to I2C_WRITE_STATUS_UPDATE
when we continue to poll for the completion of the request.

v2: Don't assume DP_AUX_I2C_WRITE is 0 even though it is, to make the
    code more obvious to the casual reader (Jani)
