drm: Don't zero vblank timestamps from the irq handler

If we couldn't get a high precisions vblank timestamp, we currently
store a zeroed timestamp instead and assume the next vblank irq to
get us something better. This makes sense when trying to update the
timestamp from eg. vblank enable. But if we do this from the vblank
irq we will never get a vblank timestamp unless we high precision
timestamps are available and succeeded. This break weston for instance
on drivers lacking high precision timestamps.

To fix this, zero the timestamp only when not called from vbl irq.
When called from the irq, we still want the timestamp, even if not
perfect.

This fixes a regression from
