ALSA: usb-audio: Add a more accurate volume quirk for AudioQuest DragonFly

AudioQuest DragonFly DAC reports a volume control range of 0..50
(0x0000..0x0032) which in USB Audio means a range of 0 .. 0.2dB, which
is obviously incorrect and would cause software using the dB information
in e.g. volume sliders to have a massive volume difference in 100..102%
range.

Commit 2d1cb7f658fb ("ALSA: usb-audio: add dB range mapping for some
devices") added a dB range mapping for it with range 0..50 dB.

However, the actual volume mapping seems to be neither linear volume nor
linear dB scale, but instead quite close to the cubic mapping e.g.
alsamixer uses, with a range of approx. -53...0 dB.

Replace the previous quirk with a custom dB mapping based on some basic
output measurements, using a 10-item range TLV (which will still fit in
alsa-lib MAX_TLV_RANGE_SIZE).

Tested on AudioQuest DragonFly HW v1.2. The quirk is only applied if the
range is 0..50, so if this gets fixed/changed in later HW revisions it
will no longer be applied.

v2: incorporated Takashi Iwai's suggestion for the quirk application
method
