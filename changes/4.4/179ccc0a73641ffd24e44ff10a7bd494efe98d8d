rhashtable: Kill harmless RCU warning in rhashtable_walk_init

The commit c6ff5268293ef98e48a99597e765ffc417e39fa5 ("rhashtable:
Fix walker list corruption") causes a suspicious RCU usage warning
because we no longer hold ht->mutex when we dereference ht->tbl.

However, this is a false positive because we now hold ht->lock
which also guarantees that ht->tbl won't disppear from under us.

This patch kills the warning by using rcu_dereference_protected.
