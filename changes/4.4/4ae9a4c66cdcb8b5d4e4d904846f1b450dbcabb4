ARM: dts: Add vbus regulator to USB2 phy nodes on exynos3250, exynos4210 and exynos4412 boards

Exynos USB2 PHY driver now supports VBUS regulator, so add it to all
boards which have it available. This also fixes commit
7eec1266751b ("ARM: dts: Add Maxim 77693 PMIC to exynos4412-trats2"),
which added new regulators to Trats2 board, but without linking them to
the consumers.
