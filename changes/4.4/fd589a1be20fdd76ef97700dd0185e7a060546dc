ASoC: dapm: Reset dapm wcache after freeing damp widgets

If there is anything in damp->path_source_cache or
damp->path_sink_cache, it can not be valid after the widgets have been
freed. Without this patch a repeated remove and load of a machine
driver may cause NULL pointer reference in dapm_wcache_lookup() when a
freed widget, not belonging to any list, is haunting in the wcache.
