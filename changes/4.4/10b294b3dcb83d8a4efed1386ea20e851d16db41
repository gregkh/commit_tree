ARM: OMAP: Remove duplicated operand in OR operation

Commit b483a4a5a711 ("ARM: OMAP4+: hwmod data: Don't prevent RESET of
USB Host module") added the SYSC_HAS_RESET_STATUS flag to both OMAP4
and OMAP5 USB host module hwmon sysconfig but that flag was already
set for OMAP5. So now the flag appears twice in the expression.

make coccicheck complains with the following message:

omap_hwmod_54xx_data.c:1846:37-58: duplicated argument to & or |
