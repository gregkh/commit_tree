drm/vgem: Drop vgem_drm_gem_mmap

It's duplicating (without using some of the helpers) drm_gem_mmap with
the addition that it can redirect to drm-buf mmap support. But prime
import/export was dropped in

    drm/vgem: drop DRIVER_PRIME (v2)

for now, so this is dead code. And since I want to rework the locking
for drm_gem_mmap it seems simpler to de-dupe this code for now and
then start over with the reworked one again, if we want to resurrect
this all indeed.
