ALSA: firewire-lib: arrange structure for AMDTP stream

In later commit, some members related to AM824 data format will be moved
from AMDTP stream structure to data block structure. This commit is a
preparation for it. Additionally, current layout of AMDTP stream structure
is a bit mess by several extensions. This commit also arranges the layout.
