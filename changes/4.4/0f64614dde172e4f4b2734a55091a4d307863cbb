drm/i915: Fix clock readout when pipes are enabled w/o ports

The BIOS sometimes likes to enable pipes w/o any ports, at least on
older machines. Currently we fail to assign anything sensible to
crtc->hwmode.crtc_clock which leads to complaints from the vblank code.
Deal with active pipes w/o ports and assign something sensible to
crtc_clock in i9xx_get_pipe_config(). The encoder .get_config() will
override this if the port is enabled.

Gets rid of rest of these on my gen4:
[drm:drm_calc_timestamping_constants [drm]] *ERROR* crtc 24: Can't calculate constants, dotclock = 0!
[drm:i915_get_vblank_timestamp] crtc 1 is disabled

v2: Fill out crtc_clock already in i9xx_get_pipe_config() (Maarten)
