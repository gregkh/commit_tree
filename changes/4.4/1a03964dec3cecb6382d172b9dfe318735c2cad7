soc: qcom: Make qcom_smem_get() return a pointer

Passing a void ** almost always requires a cast at the call site.
Instead of littering the code with casts every time this function
is called, have qcom_smem_get() return a void pointer to the
location of the smem item. This frees the caller from having to
cast the pointer.
