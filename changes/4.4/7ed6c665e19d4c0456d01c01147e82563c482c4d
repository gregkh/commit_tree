drm: bridge/dw_hdmi-ahb-audio: add audio driver

Add ALSA based HDMI AHB audio driver for dw_hdmi.  The only buffer
format supported by the hardware is its own special IEC958 based format,
which is not compatible with any ALSA format.  To avoid doing too much
data manipulation within the driver, we support only ALSAs IEC958 LE and
24-bit PCM formats for 2 to 6 channels, which we convert to its hardware
format.

A more desirable solution would be to have this conversion in userspace,
but ALSA does not appear to allow such transformations outside of
libasound itself.
