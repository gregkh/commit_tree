i40e/i40evf: Drop useless "IN_NETPOLL" flag

The code in i40e and i40evf is using an "IN_NETPOLL" flag that has never
added any value due to the fact that the Rx clean-up is handled in NAPI.
As such the flag was set, the queue was scheduled via NAPI, and then polled
from the netpoll controller and if any Rx packets were processed the were
processed in the wrong context.

In addition the flag itself just added an unneeded conditional to the
hot-path so it can safely be dropped and save us a few instructions.
