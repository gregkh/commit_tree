x86/numachip: Introduce Numachip2 timer mechanisms

Add 1GHz 64-bit Numachip2 clocksource timer support for accurate
system-wide timekeeping, as core TSCs are unsynchronised.

Additionally, add a per-core clockevent mechanism that interrupts via the
platform IPI vector after a programmed period.

[ tglx: Taking it through x86 due to dependencies ]
