blk-merge: fix blk_bio_segment_split

Commit bdced438acd83a(block: setup bi_phys_segments after
splitting) introduces function of computing bio->bi_phys_segments
during bio splitting.

Unfortunately both bio->bi_seg_front_size and bio->bi_seg_back_size
arn't computed, so too many physical segments may be obtained
for one request since both the two are used to check if one segment
across two bios can be possible.

This patch fixes the issue by computing the two variables in
blk_bio_segment_split().
