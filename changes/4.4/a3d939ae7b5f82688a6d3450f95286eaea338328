dm: convert ffs to __ffs

ffs counts bit starting with 1 (for the least significant bit), __ffs
counts bits starting with 0. This patch changes various occurrences of ffs
to __ffs and removes subtraction of 1 from the result.

Note that __ffs (unlike ffs) is not defined when called with zero
argument, but it is not called with zero argument in any of these cases.
