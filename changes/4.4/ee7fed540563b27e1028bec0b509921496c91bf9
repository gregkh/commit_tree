watchdog: do not unpark threads in watchdog_park_threads() on error

If kthread_park() returns an error, watchdog_park_threads() should not
blindly 'roll back' the already parked threads to the unparked state.
Instead leave it up to the callers to handle such errors appropriately in
their context.  For example, it is redundant to unpark the threads if the
lockup detectors will soon be disabled by the callers anyway.
