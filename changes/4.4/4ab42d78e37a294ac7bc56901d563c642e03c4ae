ppp, slip: Validate VJ compression slot parameters completely

Currently slhc_init() treats out-of-range values of rslots and tslots
as equivalent to 0, except that if tslots is too large it will
dereference a null pointer (CVE-2015-7799).

Add a range-check at the top of the function and make it return an
ERR_PTR() on error instead of NULL.  Change the callers accordingly.

Compile-tested only.
