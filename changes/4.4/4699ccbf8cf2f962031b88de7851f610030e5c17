ARM: imx: add platform irq type setting in gpc

GPC irq domain is a child domain of GIC, now all of platform irqs
are inside GPC domain, during the module populate, all devices irq
should have correct type setting in GIC, however, there is no
.irq_set_type callback setting in GPC, so the irq_set_type will be
skipped and cause all irqs' type in /proc/interrupt are "edge" which
mismatch with irq type setting in dtb file. Since GPC has no irq
type setting, so just tell kernel to use irq_chip_set_type_parent.
