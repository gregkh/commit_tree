HID: i2c-hid: Fill in physical device providing HID functionality

Currently hid_connect() prints out following when I2C connected HID devices
is connected:

  hid-multitouch 0018:03EB:2136.0001: ... [ATML3432:00 03EB:2136] on

After "on " should read physical device name but it is left empty by the
driver.

Make it look better and fill in the physical device name.
