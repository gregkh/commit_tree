ASoC: cht_bsw_rt5672: Use snd_pcm_hw_constraint_single()

Use the new snd_pcm_hw_constraint_single() helper function rather than
installing a list constraint with a single value. Since
snd_pcm_hw_constraint_single() sets a static constraint while
snd_pcm_hw_constraint_list() sets a dynamic constraint the former is
slightly more efficient and it also needs less code.
