timers: Fix data race in timer_stats_account_timer()

timer_stats_account_timer() reads timer->start_site, then checks it
for NULL and then re-reads it again, while
timer_stats_timer_clear_start_info() can concurrently reset
timer->start_site to NULL. This should not lead to crashes, but can
double number of entries in timer stats as start_site is used during
comparison, the doubled entries will have unuseful NULL start_site.

Read timer->start_site only once in timer_stats_account_timer().

The data race was found with KernelThreadSanitizer (KTSAN).
