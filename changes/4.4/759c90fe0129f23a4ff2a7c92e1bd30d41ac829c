ALSA: USB-audio: Adjust max packet size calculation for tx_length_quirk

For the Zoom R16/24 (tx_length_quirk set), when calculating the maximum
sample frequency, consideration must be made for the fact that four bytes
of the packet contain a length descriptor and consequently must not be
counted as part of the audio data.

This is corroborated by the wMaxPacketSize for this device, which is 108
bytes according for the USB playback endpoint descriptor. The frame size
is 8 bytes (2 channels of 4 bytes each), and the 108 bytes thus work out
as 13 * 8 + 4, i.e. corresponding to 13 frames plus the additional 4 byte
length descriptor.
