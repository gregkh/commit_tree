drm/edid: Fix up clock for CEA/HDMI modes specified via detailed timings

EDID detailed timings have a resolution of 10kHz for the pixel clock, so
they can't represent certain CEA/HDMI modes accurately. If we see a mode
coming in via detailed timings which otherwise matches one of the
CEA/HDMI modes except the clock is just a bit off, let's assume that the
intention was for that mode to be one of the CEA/HDMI modes and go ahead
and fix up the clock to match the CEA/HDMI spec exactly (well, as close
as we can get with the 1 kHz resolution we use).

This should help code that's looking for an exact clock match (eg. i915
audio N/CTS setup).
