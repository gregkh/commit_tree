PM / Domains: Remove in_progress counter from struct generic_pm_domain

Commit ba2bbfbf6307 ("PM / Domains: Remove intermediate states..") changed
the power off sequence (pm_genpd_poweroff()), which from locking point of
view means the genpd mutex is held throughout the sequence.

The above change means the in_progress counter can't be updated while
pm_genpd_poweroff() is executing, which allows us to remove the counter.

Instead we inform pm_genpd_poweroff() via a bool parameter, to indicate
whether we call it from the scheduled work or from the ->runtime_suspend()
callback, since that all that matters.
