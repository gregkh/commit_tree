i40e/i40evf: adjust interrupt throttle less frequently

The adaptive ITR (interrupt throttle rate) algorithm was adjusting
the hardware's interrupt rate too frequently.  This caused a lot
of variation in the interrupt rate for fairly constant workloads.

Change the code to have a counter and adjust only once every N
number of interrupts.
