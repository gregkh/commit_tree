block/xen-blkfront: Split blkif_queue_request in 2

Currently, blkif_queue_request has 2 distinct execution path:
    - Send a discard request
    - Send a read/write request

The function is also allocating grants to use for generating the
request. Although, this is only used for read/write request.

Rather than having a function with 2 distinct execution path, separate
the function in 2. This will also remove one level of tabulation.
