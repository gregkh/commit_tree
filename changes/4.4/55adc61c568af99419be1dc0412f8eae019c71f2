clk: imx: add common logic to detect early UART usage

Both earlycon and eralyprintk depend on the bootloader setup UART
clocks being retained. This patch adds the common logic to detect such
situations and make the information available to the clock drivers, as
well as adding the facilities to disable those clocks at the end of
the kernel init.
