tipc: create broadcast transmission link at namespace init

The broadcast transmission link is currently instantiated when the
network subsystem is started, i.e., on order from user space via netlink.

This forces the broadcast transmission code to do unnecessary tests for
the existence of the transmission link, as well in single mode node as
in network mode.

In this commit, we do instead create the link during initialization of
the name space, and remove it when it is stopped. The fact that the
transmission link now has a guaranteed longer life cycle than any of its
potential clients paves the way for further code simplifcations
and optimizations.
