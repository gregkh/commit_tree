drm/i915: DSI pixel clock check

It is possible the we request to have a mode that has
higher pixel clock than our HW can support. This patch
checks if requested pixel clock is lower than the one
supported by the HW. The requested mode is discarded
if we cannot support the requested pixel clock.

This patch applies to DSI.

V2:
- removed computation for max pixel clock

V3:
- cleanup by removing unnecessary lines

V4:
- max_pixclk variable renamed as max_dotclk
- moved dot clock checking inside 'if (fixed_mode)'

V5:
- dot clock checked against fixed_mode clock
