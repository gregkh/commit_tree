tcp: avoid two atomic ops for syncookies

inet_reqsk_alloc() is used to allocate a temporary request
in order to generate a SYNACK with a cookie. Then later,
syncookie validation also uses a temporary request.

These paths already took a reference on listener refcount,
we can avoid a couple of atomic operations.
