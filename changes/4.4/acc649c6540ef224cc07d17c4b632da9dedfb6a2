Bluetooth: Fix interaction of HCI_QUIRK_RESET_ON_CLOSE and HCI_AUTO_OFF

When the controller requires the HCI Reset command to be send when
closing the transport, the HCI_AUTO_OFF needs to be accounted for. The
current code tries to actually do that, but the flag gets cleared to
early. So store its value and use it that stored value instead of
checking for a flag that is always cleared.
