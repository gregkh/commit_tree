cpufreq: create cpu/cpufreq/policyX directories

The cpufreq sysfs interface had been a bit inconsistent as one of the
CPUs for a policy had a real directory within its sysfs 'cpuX' directory
and all other CPUs had links to it. That also made the code a bit
complex as we need to take care of moving the sysfs directory if the CPU
containing the real directory is getting physically hot-unplugged.

Solve this by creating 'policyX' directories (per-policy) in
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ directory, where X is the CPU for which
the policy was first created.

This also removes the need of keeping kobj_cpu and we can remove it now.
