ARC: [plat-sim] unbork non default CONFIG_LINUX_LINK_BASE

HIGHMEM support bumped the default memory size for nsim platform to 1G.
Thus total memory ended at the very edge of start of peripherals address
space. With linux link base shifted, memory started bleeding into
peripheral space which caused early boot bad_page spew !
