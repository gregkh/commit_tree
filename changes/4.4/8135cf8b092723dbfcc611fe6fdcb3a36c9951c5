xen/pciback: Save xen_pci_op commands before processing it

Double fetch vulnerabilities that happen when a variable is
fetched twice from shared memory but a security check is only
performed the first time.

The xen_pcibk_do_op function performs a switch statements on the op->cmd
value which is stored in shared memory. Interestingly this can result
in a double fetch vulnerability depending on the performed compiler
optimization.

This patch fixes it by saving the xen_pci_op command before
processing it. We also use 'barrier' to make sure that the
compiler does not perform any optimization.

This is part of XSA155.
