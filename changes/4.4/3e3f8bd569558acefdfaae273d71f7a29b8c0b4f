ASoC: fsl_sai: fix no frame clk in master mode

After several open/close sai test with ctrl+c, there will be
I/O error. The SAI can't work anymore, can't recover. There
will be no frame clock. With adding the software reset in
trigger stop, the issue can be fixed.

This is a hardware bug/errata and reset is the only option.

According to the reference manual, the software reset doesn't
reset any control register but only internal hardware logics
such as bit clock generator, status flags, and FIFO pointers.
(Our purpose is just to reset the clock generator while the
software reset is the only way to do that.)

Since slave mode doesn't use the clock generator, only apply
the reset procedure to the master mode.

For asynchronous mode, TX will not be reset when RX is still
running. In this case, i can't reproduce this issue.
