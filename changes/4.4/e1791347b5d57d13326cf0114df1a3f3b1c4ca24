perf auxtrace: Fix 'instructions' period of zero

Instruction tracing options (i.e. --itrace) include an option for
sampling instructions at an arbitrary period. e.g.

	--itrace=i10us

means make an 'instructions' sample for every 10us of trace.

Currently the logic does not distinguish between a period of
zero and no period being specified at all, so it gets treated
as the default period which is 100000.  That doesn't really
make sense.

Fix it so that zero period is accepted and treated as meaning
"as often as possible".

In the case of Intel PT that is the same as a period of 1 and
a unit of 'instructions' (i.e. --itrace=i1i).
