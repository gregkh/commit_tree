MIPS: lantiq: add clk_round_rate()

This adds a basic implementation of clk_round_rate()
The clk_round_rate() function is called by multiple drivers and
subsystems now and the lantiq clk driver is supposed to export this,
but doesn't do so, this causes linking problems like this one:
ERROR: "clk_round_rate" [drivers/media/v4l2-core/videodev.ko] undefined!
