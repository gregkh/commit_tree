xfs: Print name and pid when memory allocation loops

This patch adds comm name and pid to warning messages printed by
kmem_alloc(), kmem_zone_alloc() and xfs_buf_allocate_memory().
This will help telling which memory allocations (e.g. kernel worker
threads, OOM victim tasks, neither) are stalling because these functions
are passing __GFP_NOWARN which suppresses not only backtrace but comm name
and pid.
