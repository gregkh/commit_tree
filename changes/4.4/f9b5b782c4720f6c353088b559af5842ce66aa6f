drm/i915/gen8: Generalize PTE writing for GEN8 PPGTT

The insert_entries function was the function used to write PTEs. For the
PPGTT it was "hardcoded" to only understand two level page tables, which
was the case for GEN7. We can reuse this for 4 level page tables, and
remove the concept of insert_entries, which was never viable past 2
level page tables anyway, but it requires a bit of rework to make the
function a bit more generic.

v2: Rebase after Mika's ppgtt cleanup / scratch merge patch series.
v3: Rebase after final merged version of Mika's ppgtt/scratch patches.
v4: Check and warn for NULL value of pdp pointer (Akash).
