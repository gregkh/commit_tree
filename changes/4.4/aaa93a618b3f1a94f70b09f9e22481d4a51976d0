ACPICA: Debugger: Fix dead lock issue ocurred in single stepping mode

ACPICA commit 35273add90da19cd8790fdb5735f52e3c9861684

When single step execution is not ended, executing another control methods
leads to dead locks around interpreter lock/namespace lock/method
serialization lock. So we should only allow one execution from the debugger
at same time. Lv Zheng.
