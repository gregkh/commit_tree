perf bench: Rename 'mem-memcpy.c' => 'mem-functions.c'

So mem-memcpy.c started out as a simple memcpy() benchmark, then it grew
memset() functionality and now I plan to add string copy benchmarks as
well.

This makes the file name a misnomer: rename it to the more generic
mem-functions.c name.

[ The "rename" was introducing __unused, wasn't removing the old file,
  and didn't update tools/perf/bench/Build, fix it ]
