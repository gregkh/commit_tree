ARM: fix uaccess_with_memcpy() with SW_DOMAIN_PAN

The uaccess_with_memcpy() code is currently incompatible with the SW
PAN code: it takes locks within the region that we've changed the DACR,
potentially sleeping as a result.  As we do not save and restore the
DACR across co-operative sleep events, can lead to an incorrect DACR
value later in this code path.
