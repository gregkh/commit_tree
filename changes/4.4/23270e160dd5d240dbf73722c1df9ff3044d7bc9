Bluetooth: hci_intel: Cleanup the device probe code

There is some unneeded code in "hci_intel" probing. First
acpi_match_device() call is needless as driver/platform/acpi core code has
already done the matching before calling the probe and the driver does not
use the returned pointer to matching _HID other than checking is it NULL.

Then tree wide grep for "hci_intel" doesn't reveal that there is any code
registering this platform device so it looks this device is always backed
with ACPI companion so also ACPI_HANDLE() test can be removed.
