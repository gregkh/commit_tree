ksm: unstable_tree_search_insert error checking cleanup

get_mergeable_page() can only return NULL (also in case of errors) or the
pinned mergeable page.  It can't return an error different than NULL.
This optimizes away the unnecessary error check.

Add a return after the "out:" label in the callee to make it more
readable.
