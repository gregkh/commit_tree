HID: wacom: Remove useless conditions from 'wacom_query_tablet_data'

When support for the Cintiq Companion Hybrid and Cintiq Companion 2 was
added (36d3c51 and f7acb55), the 'wacom_query_tablet_data' function was
updated to include references to CINTIQ_HYBRID and CINTIQ_COMPANION_2
with the thought that they were necessary to switch the touch interface
into the proper mode. This is unnecessary, however, since those types
are only ever associated with the pen interface -- the touch interfaces
are either CINTIQ_24HDT or HID_GENERIC. To avoid confusion in the future,
we remove the unnecessary CINTIQ_HYBRID and CINTIQ_COMPANION_2 conditions.
