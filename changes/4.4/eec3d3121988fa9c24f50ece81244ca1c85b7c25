lpfc: Fix for discovery failure in PT2PT when FLOGI's ELS ACC response gets aborted

Fix for discovery failure in PT2PT when FLOGI's ELS ACC response gets aborted

Change login state machine to:
- Restart FLOGI if prior is ABTS'd
- Reject incoming FLOGIs if we have one pending

The above ensures that we always finish FLOGI processing, regardless
of who initated FLOGI, before processing PLOGI's.
