ath10k: disable PCI PS for QCA988X and QCA99X0

This patch disables PCI PS for QCA988X and QCA99X0, Since PCI PS is
validated for QCA6174, let it be enabled only for QCA6174. It would be
better to execute PCI PS related functions only for the supported devices.

PCI time out issue is observed with QCA99X0 on x86 platform, We will
disable PCI PS for QCA988X and QCA99X0 until PCI PS is properly implemented.

Taking and releasing ps_lock is causing higher CPU consumption. Michal Kazior
suggested ps_lock overhead to be reworked so that ath10k_pci_wake/sleep
functions are called less often, i.e. move the powersave logic up (only during
irq handling, tx path, submitting fw commands) but that's a bigger change and
can be implemented later.
