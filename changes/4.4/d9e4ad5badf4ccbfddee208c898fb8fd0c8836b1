Document that IRQ_NONE should be returned when IRQ not actually handled

Our IRQ storm detection works when an interrupt handler returns
IRQ_NONE for thousands of consecutive interrupts in a second. It
doesn't hurt to occasionally return IRQ_NONE when the interrupt is
actually genuine.

Drivers should only be returning IRQ_HANDLED if they have actually
*done* something to stop an interrupt from happening â€” it doesn't just
mean "this really *was* my device".
