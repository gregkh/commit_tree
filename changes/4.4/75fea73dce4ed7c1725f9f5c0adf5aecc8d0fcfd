net: Swap ordering of tests in ip_route_input_mc

This patch just swaps the ordering of one of the conditional tests in
ip_route_input_mc.  Specifically it swaps the testing for the source
address to see if it is loopback, and the test to see if we allow a
loopback source address.

The reason for swapping these two tests is because it is much faster to
test if an address is loopback than it is to dereference several pointers
to get at the net structure to see if the use of loopback is allowed.
