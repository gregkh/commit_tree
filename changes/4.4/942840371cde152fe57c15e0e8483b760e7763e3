            drm/i915: enable atomic fb-helper

I've been seeing some panics on i915 when the DRM master shuts down that appear
to be caused by using an already-freed framebuffer (i.e., we're unexpectedly
dropping our initial FB's reference count to 0 and freeing it, which causes a
crash when we try to restore it later).  Digging deeper, the state FB
refcounting is working as expected, but we seem to be missing proper
refcounting on the legacy plane->fb pointers in the new atomic fbdev code.

Tracking plane->old_fb and then doing a ref/unref at the end of the
fbdev restore like we do in the legacy ioctl's ensures we don't miscount
references on plane->fb and avoids the panics.

v2 from Daniel:

Really do what the atomic ioctl does:
- Also update plane->fb and plane->crtc.
- Clear out plane->old_fb on failures too.

v3: git add everything. Oops.

v4: Also clear old_fb in all other failure paths, spotted by David.
