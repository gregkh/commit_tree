ARC: intc: No need to clear IRQ_NOAUTOEN

arc_request_percpu_irq() is called by all cores to request/enable percpu
irq. It has some "prep" calls needed by genirq:
 - setup percpu devid
 - disable IRQ_NOAUTOEN

However given that enable_percpu_irq() is called enayways, latter can be
avoided.

We are now left with irq_set_percpu_devid() quirk and that too for
ARCompact builds only, since previous patch updated ARCv2 intc to do this
in the "right" place, i.e. irq map function.

By next release, this will ultimately be fixed for ARCompact as well.
