mtd: mtdpart: Do not fail mtd probe when parsing partitions fails

Due to wrong assumption in ofpart ofpart fails on Exynos on SPI chips
with no partitions because the subnode containing controller data
confuses the ofpart parser.

Thus compiling in ofpart support automatically fails probing any SPI NOR
flash without partitions on Exynos.

Compiling in a partitioning scheme should not cause probe of otherwise
valid device to fail.

Instead, let's do the following:
 * try parsers until one succeeds
 * if no parser succeeds, report the first error we saw
 * even in the failure case, allow MTD to probe, with fallback
   partitions or no partitions at all -- the master device will still be
   registered
