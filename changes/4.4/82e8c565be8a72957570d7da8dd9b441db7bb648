rcu_sync: Simplify rcu_sync using new rcu_sync_ops structure

This commit adds the new struct rcu_sync_ops which holds sync/call
methods, and turns the function pointers in rcu_sync_struct into an array
of struct rcu_sync_ops.  This simplifies the "init" helpers by collapsing
a switch statement and explicit multiple definitions into a simple
assignment and a helper macro, respectively.
