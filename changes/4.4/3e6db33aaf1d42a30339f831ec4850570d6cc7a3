ALSA: hda - Set SKL+ hda controller power at freeze() and thaw()

It takes three minutes to enter into hibernation on some OEM SKL
machines and we see many codec spurious response after thaw() opertion.
This is because HDA is still in D0 state after freeze() call and
pci_pm_freeze/pci_pm_freeze_noirq() don't set D3 hot in pci_bus driver.
It seems bios still access HDA when system enter into freeze state,
HDA will receive codec response interrupt immediately after thaw() call.
Because of this unexpected interrupt, HDA enter into a abnormal
state and slow down the system enter into hibernation.

In this patch, we put HDA into D3 hot state in azx_freeze_noirq() and
put HDA into D0 state in azx_thaw_noirq().

V2: Only apply this fix to SKL+
    Fix compile error when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP isn't defined

[Yet another fix for CONFIG_PM_SLEEP ifdef and the additional comment
