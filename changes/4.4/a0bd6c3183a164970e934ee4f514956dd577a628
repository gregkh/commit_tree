drm/i915: Always enable execlists on BDW for vgpu

Broadwell hardware supports both ring buffer mode and execlist mode.
When i915 runs inside a VM with Intel GVT-g, we allow execlist mode
only.

The main reason of EXECLIST only is that GVT-g does not support the
dynamic mode switch between ring buffer mode and execlist mode when
running multiple virtual machines.

v2:
- Adjust the position of vgpu check in sanitize function (Joonas)
- Add vgpu error check in context initialization. (Joonas, Daniel)
