clk: qcom: Add support for GDSCs

GDSCs (Global Distributed Switch Controllers) are responsible for
safely collapsing and restoring power to peripherals in the SoC.
These are best modelled as power domains using genpd and given
the registers are scattered throughout the clock controller register
space, its best to have the support added through the clock driver.
