lib/kasprintf.c: introduce kvasprintf_const

This adds kvasprintf_const which tries to use kstrdup_const if possible:
If the format string contains no % characters, or if the format string is
exactly "%s", we delegate to kstrdup_const.  Otherwise, we fall back to
kvasprintf.

Just as for kstrdup_const, the main motivation is to save memory by
reusing .rodata when possible.

The return value should be freed by kfree_const, just like for
kstrdup_const.

There is deliberately no kasprintf_const: In the vast majority of cases,
the format string argument is a literal, so one can determine statically
whether one could instead use kstrdup_const directly (which would also
require one to change all corresponding kfree calls to kfree_const).
