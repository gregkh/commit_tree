usb: dwc3: gadget: don't prestart interrupt endpoints

Because interrupt endpoints usually transmit such
small amounts of data, it seems pointless to prestart
transfers and try to get speed improvements. This
patch also sorts out a problem with CDC ECM function
where its notification endpoint gets stuck in busy
state and we continuously issue Update Transfer
commands.
