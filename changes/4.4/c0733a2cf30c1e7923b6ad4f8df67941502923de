iommu/arm-smmu: Fix error checking for ASID and VMID allocation

The bitmap allocator returns an int, which is one of the standard
negative values on failure. Rather than assigning this straight to a
u16 (like we do for the ASID and VMID callers), which means that we
won't detect failure correctly, use an int for the purposes of error
checking.
