nilfs2: add a tracepoint for tracking stage transition of segment construction

This patch adds a tracepoint for tracking stage transition of block
collection in segment construction.  With the tracepoint, we can analysis
the behavior of segment construction in depth.  It would be useful for
bottleneck detection and debugging, etc.

The tracepoint is created with the standard trace API of linux (like ext3,
ext4, f2fs and btrfs).  So we can analysis with existing tools easily.  Of
course, more detailed analysis will be possible if we can create nilfs
specific analysis tools.

Below is an example of event dump with Brendan Gregg's perf-tools
(https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools).  Time consumption between
each stage can be obtained.

$ sudo bin/tpoint nilfs2:nilfs2_collection_stage_transition

For capturing transition correctly, this patch adds wrappers for the
member scnt of nilfs_cstage.  With this change, every transition of the
stage can produce trace event in a correct manner.
