drm/i915: Workaround CHV pipe C cursor fail

Turns out CHV pipe C was glued on somewhat poorly, and there's something
wrong with the cursor. If the cursor straddles the left screen edge,
and is then moved away from the edge or disabled, the pipe will often
underrun. If enough underruns are triggered quickly enough the pipe
will fall over and die (it just scans out a solid color and reports
a constant underrun). We need to turn the disp2d power well off and
on again to recover the pipe.

None of that is very nice for the user, so let's just refuse to place
the cursor in the compromised position. The ddx appears to fall back
to swcursor when the ioctl returns an error, so theoretically there's
no loss of functionality for the user (discounting swcursor bugs).
I suppose most cursors images actually have the hotspot not exactly
at 0,0 so under typical conditions the fallback will in fact kick in
as soon as the cursor touches the left edge of the screen.

Any atomic compositor should anyway be prepared to fall back to
GPU composition when things don't work out, so there should be no
problem with those.

Other things that I tried to solve this include flipping all
display related clock gating knobs I could find, increasing the
minimum gtt alignment all the way up to 512k. I also tried to see
if there are more specific screen coordinates that hit the bug, but
the findings were somewhat inconclusive. Sometimes the failures
happen almost across the whole left edge, sometimes more at the very
top and around the bottom half. I wasn't able to find any real pattern
to these variations, so it seems our only choice is to just refuse
to straddle the left screen edge at all.
