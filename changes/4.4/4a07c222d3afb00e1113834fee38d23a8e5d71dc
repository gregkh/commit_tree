cgroup: replace "cgroup.populated" with "cgroup.events"

memcg already uses "memory.events" for event reporting and other
controllers may need event reporting too.  Let's standardize on
"$SUBSYS.events" interface file for reporting events which don't
happen too frequently and thus can share event notification.

"cgroup.populated" is replaced with "populated" field in
"cgroup.events" and documentation is updated accordingly.
