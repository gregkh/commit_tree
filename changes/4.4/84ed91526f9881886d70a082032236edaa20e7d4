xhci: Fix memory leak in xhci_pme_acpi_rtd3_enable()

There is a memory leak because acpi_evaluate_dsm() actually returns an
object which the caller is supposed to release. Fix this by calling
ACPI_FREE() for the returned object (this expands to kfree() so passing
NULL there is fine as well).

While there correct indentation in !CONFIG_ACPI case.
