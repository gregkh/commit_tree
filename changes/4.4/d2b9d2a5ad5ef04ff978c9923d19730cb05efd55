powerpc/tm: Block signal return setting invalid MSR state

Currently we allow both the MSR T and S bits to be set by userspace on
a signal return.  Unfortunately this is a reserved configuration and
will cause a TM Bad Thing exception if attempted (via rfid).

This patch checks for this case in both the 32 and 64 bit signals
code.  If both T and S are set, we mark the context as invalid.

Found using a syscall fuzzer.
