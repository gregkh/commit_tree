net: hns: fix 32-bit build warning

The recently added hns driver causes a build warning in ARM
allmodconfig builds:

drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hns/hnae.c: In function 'handles_show':
drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hns/hnae.c:452:13: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
          j, (u64)h->qs[i]->io_base);
             ^

This removes the pointless cast and prints the pointer address using
the "%p" format string in all three locations.
