scripts/kconfig/Makefile: Allow KBUILD_DEFCONFIG to be a target

Arch Makefiles can set KBUILD_DEFCONFIG to tell kbuild the name of the
defconfig that should be built by default.

However currently there is an assumption that KBUILD_DEFCONFIG points to
a file at arch/$(SRCARCH)/configs/$(KBUILD_DEFCONFIG).

We would like to use a target, using merge_config, as our defconfig, so
adapt the logic in scripts/kconfig/Makefile to allow that.

To minimise the chance of breaking anything, we first check if
KBUILD_DEFCONFIG is a file, and if so we do the old logic. If it's not a
file, then we call the top-level Makefile with KBUILD_DEFCONFIG as the
target.
