null_blk: fix use-after-free error

blk_end_request_all may free request, so we need to save
request_queue pointer before blk_end_request_all call.

The problem was introduced in commit cf8ecc5a8455266f8d51
("null_blk: guarantee device restart in all irq modes")
and causes general protection fault with slab poisoning
enabled.

Fixes: cf8ecc5a8455266f8d51 ("null_blk: guarantee device
       restart in all irq modes")
