ALSA: firewire-lib: avoid endless loop to transfer MIDI messages at fatal error

Currently, when asynchronous transactions finish in error state and
retries, work scheduling and work running also continues. This
should be canceled at fatal error because it can cause endless loop.

This commit enables to cancel transferring MIDI messages when transactions
encounter fatal errors. This is achieved by setting error state.
