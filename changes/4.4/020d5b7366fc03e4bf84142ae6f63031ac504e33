Btrfs: fix race between scrub and block group deletion

Scrub can race with the cleaner kthread deleting block groups that are
unused (and with relocation too) leading to a failure with error -EINVAL
that gets returned to user space.

The following diagram illustrates how it happens:

              CPU 1                                 CPU 2

 cleaner kthread
   btrfs_delete_unused_bgs()

     gets block group X from
     fs_info->unused_bgs

     sets block group to RO

       btrfs_remove_chunk(bg X)

         deletes device extents

                                         scrub_enumerate_chunks()

                                           searches device tree using
                                           its commit root

                                           finds device extent for
                                           block group X

                                           gets block group X from the tree
                                           fs_info->block_group_cache_tree
                                           (via btrfs_lookup_block_group())

                                           sets bg X to RO (again)

          btrfs_remove_block_group(bg X)

            deletes block group from
            fs_info->block_group_cache_tree

            removes extent map from
            fs_info->mapping_tree

                                               scrub_chunk(offset X)

                                                 searches fs_info->mapping_tree
                                                 for extent map starting at
                                                 offset X

                                                    --> doesn't find any such
                                                        extent map
                                                    --> returns -EINVAL and scrub
                                                        errors out to userspace
                                                        with -EINVAL

Fix this by dealing with an extent map lookup failure as an indicator of
block group deletion.
Issue reproduced with fstest btrfs/071.
