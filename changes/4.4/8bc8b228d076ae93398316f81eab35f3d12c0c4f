mm/zswap: change incorrect strncmp use to strcmp

Change the use of strncmp in zswap_pool_find_get() to strcmp.

The use of strncmp is no longer correct, now that zswap_zpool_type is
not an array; sizeof() will return the size of a pointer, which isn't
the right length to compare.  We don't need to use strncmp anyway,
because the existing params and the passed in params are all guaranteed
to be null terminated, so strcmp should be used.
