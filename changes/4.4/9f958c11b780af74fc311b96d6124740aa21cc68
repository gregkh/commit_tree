KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Trust the LR state for HW IRQs

We were probing the physial distributor state for the active state of a
HW virtual IRQ, because we had seen evidence that the LR state was not
cleared when the guest deactivated a virtual interrupted.

However, this issue turned out to be a software bug in the GIC, which
was solved by: 84aab5e68c2a5e1e18d81ae8308c3ce25d501b29
(KVM: arm/arm64: arch_timer: Preserve physical dist. active
state on LR.active, 2015-11-24)

Therefore, get rid of the complexities and just look at the LR.
