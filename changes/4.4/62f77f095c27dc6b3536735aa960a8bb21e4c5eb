ath10k: enable adaptive CCA

European Union has made it mandatory that all devices working in 2.4 GHz
has to adhere to the ETSI specification (ETSI EN 300 328 V1.9.1)
beginnig this year. The standard basically speaks about interferences
in 2.4Ghz band.
For example, when 802.11 device detects interference, TX must be stopped
as long as interference is present.

Adaptive CCA is a feature, when enabled the device learns from the
environment and configures CCA levels adaptively. This will improve
detecting interferences and the device can stop trasmissions till the
interference is present eventually leading to good performances in
varying interference conditions.

The patch includes code for enabling adaptive CCA for 10.2.4 firmware on
QCA988X.
