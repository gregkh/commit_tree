ARM: dts: am4372: fix clock source for arm twd and global timers

ARM TWD and Global timer are clocked by PERIPHCLK which is MPU_CLK/2.
But now they are clocked by dpll_mpu_m2_ck == MPU_CLK and, as result.
Timekeeping core misbehaves. For example, execution of command
"sleep 5" will take 10 sec instead of 5.

Hence, fix it by adding mpu_periphclk ("fixed-factor-clock") and use
it for clocking ARM TWD and Global timer (same way as on OMAP4).
