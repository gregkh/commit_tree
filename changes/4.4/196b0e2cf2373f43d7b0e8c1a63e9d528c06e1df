spi: pxa2xx: Remove if statement that is always true in pump_transfers()

This is continuation to previous commit by separating unindentation from
variable removal done in previous commit. As said SPI core have validated
both the speed_hz and bits_per_word and the if statement here evaluates
always to true.

Remove the test and unindent the code block accordingly. While at it remove
also needless "cr0 = chip->cr0" as cr0 will be overwritten anyway and fix
block comment style.
