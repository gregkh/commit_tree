ALSA: firewire-tascam: change device probing processing

Currently, this driver picks up model name with be32_to_cpu() macro
to align characters. This is wrong operation because the result is
different depending on CPU endiannness.

Additionally, vendor released several versions of firmware for this
series. It's not better to assign model-dependent information to
device entry according to the version field.

This commit fixes these bugs. The name of model is picked up correctly
and used to identify model-dependent information.
