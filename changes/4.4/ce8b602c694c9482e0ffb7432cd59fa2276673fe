arm64: Refactor check_cpu_capabilities

check_cpu_capabilities runs through a given list of caps and
checks if the system has the cap, updates the system capability
bitmap and also runs any enable() methods associated with them.
All of this is not quite obvious from the name 'check'. This
patch splits the check_cpu_capabilities into two parts :

1) update_cpu_capabilities
 => Runs through the given list and updates the system
    wide capability map.
2) enable_cpu_capabilities
 => Runs through the given list and invokes enable() (if any)
    for the caps enabled on the system.
