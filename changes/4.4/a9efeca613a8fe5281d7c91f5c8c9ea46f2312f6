serial: sh-sci: Prevent compiler warnings on 64-bit

Expressions involving "BIT(...)" create values of type "long", which is
64-bit on 64-bit.  Hence "~BIT(...)" no longer fits in 32-bit, which
will cause future compiler warnings when assigning to 32-bit variables:

    drivers/tty/serial/sh-sci.c: In function 'sci_init_single':
    drivers/tty/serial/sh-sci.h:58:25: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Woverflow]
     #define SCI_ERROR_CLEAR ~(SCI_RESERVED | SCI_PER | SCI_FER | SCI_ORER)
			     ^
    drivers/tty/serial/sh-sci.c:2325:27: note: in expansion of macro 'SCI_ERROR_CLEAR'
       sci_port->error_clear = SCI_ERROR_CLEAR;

As these values are (at most) 32-bit register values anyway, cast them
to "u32" at the definition level to prevent such compiler warnings.
