net: mvneta: fix bit assignment for RX packet irq enable

A value originally defined in the driver was inappropriate. Even though
the ingress was somehow working, writing MVNETA_RXQ_INTR_ENABLE_ALL_MASK
to MVNETA_INTR_ENABLE didn't make any effect, because the bits [31:16]
are reserved and read-only.

This commit updates MVNETA_RXQ_INTR_ENABLE_ALL_MASK to be compliant with
the controller's documentation.
