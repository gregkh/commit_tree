nilfs2: fix gcc uninitialized-variable warnings in powerpc build

Some false positive warnings are reported for powerpc build.

The following warnings are reported in
 http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/buildresult/12519703/

   CC      fs/nilfs2/super.o
 fs/nilfs2/super.c: In function 'nilfs_resize_fs':
 fs/nilfs2/super.c:376:2: warning: 'blocknr' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
 fs/nilfs2/super.c:362:11: note: 'blocknr' was declared here
   CC      fs/nilfs2/recovery.o
 fs/nilfs2/recovery.c: In function 'nilfs_salvage_orphan_logs':
 fs/nilfs2/recovery.c:631:21: warning: 'sum' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
 fs/nilfs2/recovery.c:585:32: note: 'sum' was declared here
 fs/nilfs2/recovery.c: In function 'nilfs_search_super_root':

   CC      fs/nilfs2/btree.o
 fs/nilfs2/btree.c: In function 'nilfs_btree_convert_and_insert':
 include/asm-generic/bitops/non-atomic.h:105:20: warning: 'bh' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
 fs/nilfs2/btree.c:1859:22: note: 'bh' was declared here

This cleans out these warnings by forcing the variables to be initialized.
