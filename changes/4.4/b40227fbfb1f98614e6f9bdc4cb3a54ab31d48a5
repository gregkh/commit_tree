acpi, x86: Implement arch_apei_get_mem_attributes()

... to allow an arch specific implementation of getting page
protection type associated with a physical address.

On x86, we currently have no way to look up the EFI memory map
attributes for a region in a consistent way, because the
memmap is discarded after efi_free_boot_services(). So if
you call efi_mem_attributes() during boot and at runtime,
you could theoretically see different attributes.

Since we are yet to see any x86 platforms that require
anything other than PAGE_KERNEL (some arm64 platforms
require the equivalent of PAGE_KERNEL_NOCACHE), return that
until we know differently.
