staging: comedi: return error on "read" if no command set up

The "read" file operation handler, `comedi_read()` returns an error for
pretty much any condition that prevents a "read" going ahead.  One of
the conditions that prevents a "read" going ahead is that no
asynchronous command has been set up, but that currently results in a
return value of 0 (unless COMEDI instructions are being processed or an
asynchronous command has been set up by a different file object).
Change it to return `-EINVAL` in this case.
