ath10k: poll HTT send completion when CE 5 is unused

commit a70587b3389a ("ath10k: configure copy engine 5 for HTT messages")
moved send completion polling under HTT Rx (CE 5) service routine. For
QCA6174 based devices copy engine 1 (CE 1) is used for HTT Rx instead
of CE 5. So send completion never be called. This is causing "failed to
transmit packet, dropping: -105" errors. Fix this by processing send
completion from CE 1 service routine instead of CE 5.
