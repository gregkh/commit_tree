net: phy: at803x: support interrupt on 8030 and 8035

Commit 77a993942 "phy/at8031: enable at8031 to work on interrupt mode"
added interrupt support for the 8031 PHY but left out the other two
chips supported by this driver.

This patch sets the .ack_interrupt and .config_intr functions for the
8030 and 8035 drivers as well.
