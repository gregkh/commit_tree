switchdev: introduce possibility to defer obj_add/del

Similar to the attr usecase, the caller knows if he is holding RTNL and is
in atomic section. So let the called to decide the correct call variant.

This allows drivers to sleep inside their ops and wait for hw to get the
operation status. Then the status is propagated into switchdev core.
This avoids silent errors in drivers.
