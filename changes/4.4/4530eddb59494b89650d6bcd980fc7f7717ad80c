cgroup, memcg, cpuset: implement cgroup_taskset_for_each_leader()

It wasn't explicitly documented but, when a process is being migrated,
cpuset and memcg depend on cgroup_taskset_first() returning the
threadgroup leader; however, this approach is somewhat ghetto and
would no longer work for the planned multi-process migration.

This patch introduces explicit cgroup_taskset_for_each_leader() which
iterates over only the threadgroup leaders and replaces
cgroup_taskset_first() usages for accessing the leader with it.

This prepares both memcg and cpuset for multi-process migration.  This
patch also updates the documentation for cgroup_taskset_for_each() to
clarify the iteration rules and removes comments mentioning task
ordering in tasksets.

v2: A previous patch which added threadgroup leader test was dropped.
    Patch updated accordingly.
