staging: lustre: kernel style neating (block comments)

Fix lustre/ptlrpc/client.c block comments following the Coding Style
preferred format for multi-line and single-line comments:

        /*
         * This is the preferred style for multi-line
         * comments in the Linux kernel source code.
         * Please use it consistently.
         *
         * Description:  A column of asterisks on the left side,
         * with beginning and ending almost-blank lines.
         */

Included some minor textual fixes to get some comments on a single line.
