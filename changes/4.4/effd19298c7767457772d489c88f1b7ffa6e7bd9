iwlwifi: mvm: Implement per vif frame registration API

Implement config_iface_filter() driver op. Currently support only
probe request registration for p2p client vifs, by setting
MAC_FILTER_IN_PROBE_REQUEST flag in MAC_CONTEXT_CMD.
This is needed since WFDS spec and certification require a P2P client
to be discoverable on its operating channel.
