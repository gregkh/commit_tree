Revert "SCSI: Fix NULL pointer dereference in runtime PM"

This reverts commit 49718f0fb8c9 ("SCSI: Fix NULL pointer dereference in
runtime PM")

The old commit may lead to a issue that blk_{pre|post}_runtime_suspend and
blk_{pre|post}_runtime_resume may not be called in pairs.

Take sr device as example, when sr device goes to runtime suspend,
blk_{pre|post}_runtime_suspend will be called since sr device defined
pm->runtime_suspend. But blk_{pre|post}_runtime_resume will not be called
since sr device doesn't have pm->runtime_resume. so, sr device can not
resume correctly anymore.
