x86/fpu: Rename XSAVE macros

There are two concepts that have some confusing naming:
 1. Extended State Component numbers (currently called
    XFEATURE_BIT_*)
 2. Extended State Component masks (currently called XSTATE_*)

The numbers are (currently) from 0-9.  State component 3 is the
bounds registers for MPX, for instance.

But when we want to enable "state component 3", we go set a bit
in XCR0.  The bit we set is 1<<3.  We can check to see if a
state component feature is enabled by looking at its bit.

The current 'xfeature_bit's are at best xfeature bit _numbers_.
Calling them bits is at best inconsistent with ending the enum
list with 'XFEATURES_NR_MAX'.

This patch renames the enum to be 'xfeature'.  These also
happen to be what the Intel documentation calls a "state
component".

We also want to differentiate these from the "XSTATE_*" macros.
The "XSTATE_*" macros are a mask, and we rename them to match.

These macros are reasonably widely used so this patch is a
wee bit big, but this really is just a rename.

The only non-mechanical part of this is the

	s/XSTATE_EXTEND_MASK/XFEATURE_MASK_EXTEND/

We need a better name for it, but that's another patch.
