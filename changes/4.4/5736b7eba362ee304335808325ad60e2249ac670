iwlwifi: remove IWL3165_UCODE_API_OK and _MIN

As the 3165 device uses the same firmware as 7265-D and currently
all 7000 series (including 3160/3165) use the same API versions
remove IWL3165_UCODE_API_OK and _MIN. We might have to put them
back if firmware support ever splits, but in that case might also
have to add a different MODULE_FIRMWARE statement.
