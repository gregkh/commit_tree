mm: page_alloc: hide some GFP internals and document the bits and flag combinations

Andrew stated the following

	We have quite a history of remote parts of the kernel using
	weird/wrong/inexplicable combinations of __GFP_ flags.	I tend
	to think that this is because we didn't adequately explain the
	interface.

	And I don't think that gfp.h really improved much in this area as
	a result of this patchset.  Could you go through it some time and
	decide if we've adequately documented all this stuff?

This patches first moves some GFP flag combinations that are part of the MM
internals to mm/internal.h. The rest of the patch documents the __GFP_FOO
bits under various headings and then documents the flag combinations. It
will not help callers that are brain damaged but the clarity might motivate
some fixes and avoid future mistakes.
