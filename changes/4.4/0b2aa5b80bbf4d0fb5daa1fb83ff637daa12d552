arm64: Fix R/O permissions in mark_rodata_ro

The permissions in mark_rodata_ro trigger a build error
with STRICT_MM_TYPECHECKS. Fix this by introducing
PAGE_KERNEL_ROX for the same reasons as PAGE_KERNEL_RO.
From Ard:

"PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC has PTE_WRITE set as well, making the range
writeable under the ARMv8.1 DBM feature, that manages the
dirty bit in hardware (writing to a page with the PTE_RDONLY
and PTE_WRITE bits both set will clear the PTE_RDONLY bit in that case)"
