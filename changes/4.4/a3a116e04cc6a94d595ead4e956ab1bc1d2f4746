af_unix: take receive queue lock while appending new skb

While possibly in future we don't necessarily need to use
sk_buff_head.lock this is a rather larger change, as it affects the
af_unix fd garbage collector, diag and socket cleanups. This is too much
for a stable patch.

For the time being grab sk_buff_head.lock without disabling bh and irqs,
so don't use locked skb_queue_tail.
