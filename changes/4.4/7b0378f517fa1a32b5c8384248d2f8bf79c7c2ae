asix: Rename remaining and size for clarity

The Data header synchronisation is easier to understand
if the variables "remaining" and "size" are renamed.

Therefore, the lifetime of the "remaining" variable exists
outside of asix_rx_fixup_internal() and is used to indicate
any remaining pending bytes of the Ethernet frame that need
to be obtained from the next socket buffer. This allows an
Ethernet frame to span across multiple socket buffers.

"size" is now local to asix_rx_fixup_internal() and contains
the size read from the Data header 32-bit word.

Add "copy_length" to hold the number of the Ethernet frame
bytes (maybe a part of a full frame) that are to be copied
out of the socket buffer.
