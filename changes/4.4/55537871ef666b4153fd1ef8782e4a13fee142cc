kernel/watchdog.c: perform all-CPU backtrace in case of hard lockup

In many cases of hardlockup reports, it's actually not possible to know
why it triggered, because the CPU that got stuck is usually waiting on a
resource (with IRQs disabled) in posession of some other CPU is holding.

IOW, we are often looking at the stacktrace of the victim and not the
actual offender.

Introduce sysctl / cmdline parameter that makes it possible to have
hardlockup detector perform all-CPU backtrace.
