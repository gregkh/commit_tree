cpufreq: use last policy after online for drivers with ->setpolicy

For cpufreq drivers which use setpolicy interface, after offline->online
the policy is set to default. This can be reproduced by setting the
default policy of intel_pstate or longrun to ondemand and then change to
"performance". After offline and online, the setpolicy will be called with
the policy=ondemand.

For drivers using governors this condition is handled by storing
last_governor, during offline and restoring during online. The same should
be done for drivers using setpolicy interface. Storing last_policy during
offline and restoring during online.
