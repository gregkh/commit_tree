tracing: Call on_each_cpu() when adding or removing single pids from set_event_pid

For the case where pids are already in set_event_pid, and one is added or
removed then each CPU should be checked to make sure that the new or old pid
is on or not on a CPU.

 For example:

 # echo 123 >> set_event_pid

or

 # echo '!123' >> set_event_pid
