dmaengine: edma: Simplify and optimize ccerr interrupt handler

No need to run through the bits in QEMR and CCERR events since they will
not trigger any action, so just clearing the errors there is fine.
In case of the missed event the loop can be optimized so we spend less time
to handle the event.
