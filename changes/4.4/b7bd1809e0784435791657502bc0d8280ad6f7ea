netfilter: nfnetlink_queue: get rid of nfnetlink_queue_ct.c

The original intention was to avoid dependencies between nfnetlink_queue and
conntrack without ifdef pollution. However, we can achieve this by moving the
conntrack dependent code into ctnetlink and keep some glue code to access the
nfq_ct indirection from nfqueue.

After this patch, the nfq_ct indirection is always compiled in the netfilter
core to avoid polluting nfqueue with ifdefs. Thus, if nf_conntrack is not
compiled this results in only 8-bytes of memory waste in x86_64.

This patch also adds ctnetlink_nfqueue_seqadj() to avoid that the nf_conn
structure layout if exposed to nf_queue, which creates another dependency with
nf_conntrack at compilation time.
