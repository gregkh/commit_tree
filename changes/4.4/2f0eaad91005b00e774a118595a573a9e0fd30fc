ALSA: hda - Fix bogus codec address check for mixer name assignment

The recent commit [7fbe824a0f0e: ALSA: hda - Update mixer name for the
lower codec address] tried to improve the mixer chip name assignment
in the order of codec address.  However, this fix was utterly bogus;
it checks the field set in each codec, thus this value is reset at
each codec creation, of course.  For really handling this priority,
the assignment has to be remembered in the common place, namely in
hda_bus, instead of hda_codec.
