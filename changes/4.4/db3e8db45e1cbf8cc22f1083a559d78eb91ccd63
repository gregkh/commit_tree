rcu: Use call_rcu_func_t to replace explicit type equivalents

We have had the call_rcu_func_t typedef for a quite awhile, but we still
use explicit function pointer types in some places.  These types can
confuse cscope and can be hard to read.  This patch therefore replaces
these types with the call_rcu_func_t typedef.
