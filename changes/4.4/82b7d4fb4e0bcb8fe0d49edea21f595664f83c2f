debugfs: Add read-only/write-only x64 file ops

There aren't any read-only or write-only x64 file ops, but there
is a caller of debugfs_create_x64() that calls it with mode equal
to S_IRUGO. This leads to the possibility of userspace modifying
the file, so let's use the newly created debugfs_create_mode()
helper here to fix this.
