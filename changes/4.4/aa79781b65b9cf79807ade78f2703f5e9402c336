bpf: abstract anon_inode_getfd invocations

Since we're going to use anon_inode_getfd() invocations in more than just
the current places, make a helper function for both, so that we only need
to pass a map/prog pointer to the helper itself in order to get a fd. The
new helpers are called bpf_map_new_fd() and bpf_prog_new_fd().
