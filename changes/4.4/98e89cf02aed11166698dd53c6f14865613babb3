mm: kmemleak: mark kmemleak_init prototype as __init

The kmemleak_init() definition in mm/kmemleak.c is marked __init but its
prototype in include/linux/kmemleak.h is marked __ref since commit
a6186d89c913 ("kmemleak: Mark the early log buffer as __initdata").

This causes a section mismatch which is reported as a warning when
building with clang -Wsection, because kmemleak_init() is declared in
section .ref.text but defined in .init.text.

Fix this by marking kmemleak_init() prototype __init.
