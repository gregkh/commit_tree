mfd: arizona: Use correct type ID for device tree config

In the case of a device tree config the code uses the device ID
from the DT entry to check which codec is required but when storing
the ID into struct arizona it was always using the non-DT SPI device
table to get an ID.

This patch changes the code to store the correct ID into struct arizona.
