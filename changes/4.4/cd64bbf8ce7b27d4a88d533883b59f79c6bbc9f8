ACPICA: Debugger: Update mutexes used for multithreaded debugger

ACPICA commit 6b2701f619040e803313363f516b200e362a9100

Make these mutex objects independent of the deadlock detection mechanism.
This mechanism caused failures with the multithread debugger.

This patch doesn't affect Linux kernel as debugger is currently not fully
functioning in the Linux kernel. And the further debugger cleanups will
take care of handling debugger command signalling correctly instead of
using such kind of mutexes. So it is safe to leave this patch as it is.
