ARM: dove: Fix legacy get_irqnr_and_base

Commit 5d6bed2a9c ("ARM: dove: fix legacy dove IRQ numbers") shifted
IRQ numbers by one but didn't update the get_irqnr_and_base macro
accordingly.  This macro is involved when CONFIG_MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER
is not defined.

[jac: 5d6bed2a9c went in to v4.2, but was backported to v3.18]
