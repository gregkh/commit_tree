s390: don't store registers on disabled wait anymore

The current disabled wait code stores register contents into their
save areas, however it is (at least) missing the new vector registers.

Given the fact that the whole exercise seems to be rather pointless
simply don't save any registers anymore.

In a "live" system it is always possible to inspect register contents,
and in case of a dump the register contents will be stored by the
dump mechanism.
