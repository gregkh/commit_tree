Staging: fbtbt: Replace timespec with ktime_t

struct timespec will overflow in year 2038, so replace it with
ktime_t. And replace functions that use struct timespec,
timespec_sub with ktime_sub. Also use monotonic time instead of real
time, by replacing getnstimeofday with ktime_get, to be more robust
against leap seconds and settimeofday() calls.
