rcu: Better hotplug handling for synchronize_sched_expedited()

Earlier versions of synchronize_sched_expedited() can prematurely end
grace periods due to the fact that a CPU marked as cpu_is_offline()
can still be using RCU read-side critical sections during the time that
CPU makes its last pass through the scheduler and into the idle loop
and during the time that a given CPU is in the process of coming online.
This commit therefore eliminates this window by adding additional
interaction with the CPU-hotplug operations.
