memcg: unify slab and other kmem pages charging

We have memcg_kmem_charge and memcg_kmem_uncharge methods for charging and
uncharging kmem pages to memcg, but currently they are not used for
charging slab pages (i.e.  they are only used for charging pages allocated
with alloc_kmem_pages).  The only reason why the slab subsystem uses
special helpers, memcg_charge_slab and memcg_uncharge_slab, is that it
needs to charge to the memcg of kmem cache while memcg_charge_kmem charges
to the memcg that the current task belongs to.

To remove this diversity, this patch adds an extra argument to
__memcg_kmem_charge that can be a pointer to a memcg or NULL.  If it is
not NULL, the function tries to charge to the memcg it points to,
otherwise it charge to the current context.  Next, it makes the slab
subsystem use this function to charge slab pages.

Since memcg_charge_kmem and memcg_uncharge_kmem helpers are now used only
in __memcg_kmem_charge and __memcg_kmem_uncharge, they are inlined.  Since
__memcg_kmem_charge stores a pointer to the memcg in the page struct, we
don't need memcg_uncharge_slab anymore and can use free_kmem_pages.
Besides, one can now detect which memcg a slab page belongs to by reading
/proc/kpagecgroup.

Note, this patch switches slab to charge-after-alloc design.  Since this
design is already used for all other memcg charges, it should not make any
difference.
