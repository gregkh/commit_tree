rtc: opal: enable support for the stardard "wakeup-source" property

Though the opal rtc driver should and will continue to support the legacy
"has-tpo" property to enable RTC as the wakeup source, we need to add
support for the new standard property "wakeup-source"

This patch adds support for "wakeup-source" property in addition to the
existing "has-tpo" property.
