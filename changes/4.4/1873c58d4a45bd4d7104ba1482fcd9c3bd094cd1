ethernet:ti:cpsw: fix phy identification with multiple slaves on fixed-phy

When using more than one slave with ti cpsw and fixed phy the pd->phy_id
will be always zero, but slave_data->phy_id must be unique. pd->phy_id
means a "phy hardware id" whereas slave_data->phy_id means an "unique id",
so we should use pd->addr which has the same unique meaning.
