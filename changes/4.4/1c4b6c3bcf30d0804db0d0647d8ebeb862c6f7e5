i2c: imx: implement bus recovery

Implement bus recovery methods for i2c-imx so we can recover from
situations where SCL/SDA are stuck low.

Once i2c bus SCL/SDA are stuck low during transfer, config the i2c
pinctrl to gpio mode by calling pinctrl sleep set function, and then
use GPIO to emulate the i2c protocol to send nine dummy clock to recover
i2c device. After recovery, set i2c pinctrl to default group setting.
