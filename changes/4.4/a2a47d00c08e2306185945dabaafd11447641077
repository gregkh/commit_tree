misc: mic: fix memory leak

In scif_node_connect() we were returning if the initialization of p2p_ji
fails. But at that time p2p_ij has already been initialized and
resources allocated for it. And since p2p_ij is not added to the list
till now so we will have a leak.
Lets deinitialize and release the resources connected to p2p_ij.
