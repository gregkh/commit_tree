packet: always probe for transport header

We concluded that the skb_probe_transport_header() should better be
called unconditionally. Avoiding the call into the flow dissector has
also not really much to do with the direct xmit mode.

While it seems that only virtio_net code makes use of GSO from non
RX/TX ring packet socket paths, we should probe for a transport header
nevertheless before they hit devices.
