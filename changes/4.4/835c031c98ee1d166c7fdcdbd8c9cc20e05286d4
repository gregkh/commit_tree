powerpc/booke64: Fix args to copy_and_flush

Convert r4/r5, not r6, to a virtual address when calling
copy_and_flush.  Otherwise, r3 is already virtual, and copy_to_flush
tries to access r3+r6, PAGE_OFFSET gets added twice.

This isn't normally seen because on book3e we normally enter with
the kernel at zero and thus skip copy_to_flush -- but it will be
needed for kexec support.
