Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt: a little tidying

There's an odd line about "Locked" at the head of the description of
/proc/meminfo: it seems to have strayed from /proc/PID/smaps, so lead it
back there.  Move "Swap" and "SwapPss" descriptions down above it, to
match the order in the file (though "PageSize"s still undescribed).

The example of "Locked: 374 kB" (the same as Pss, neither Rss nor Size) is
so unlikely as to be misleading: just make it 0, this is /bin/bash text;
which would be "dw" (disabled write) not "de" (do not expand).
