drm/bridge: ps8622: Fix coccinelle warnings

The platform_no_drv_owner.cocci coccinelle script generates the
following warning:

	drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/parade-ps8622.c:671:3-8: No need to set .owner here. The core will do it.

Remove .owner field if calls are used which set it automatically. Patch
generated by scripts/coccinelle/api/platform_no_drv_owner.cocci.
