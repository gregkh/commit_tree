arm64: add cpu_idle tracepoints to arch_cpu_idle

Currently, if cpuidle is disabled or not supported, powertop reports
zero wakeups and zero events. This is due to the cpu_idle tracepoints
are missing.

This patch is to make cpu_idle tracepoints always available even if
cpuidle is disabled or not supported.
