PCI: mvebu: Split port parsing and resource claiming from  port setup

Split the PCIe port DT parsing and resource claiming from setting up the
actual ports.  This allows us to gather all the resources first, before
touching the hardware.  This is important as some of these resources (such
as the GPIO for the PCIe reset) may defer probing.
