HID: wacom: Tie cached HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT indices to report ID

The cached indicies 'cc_index' and 'cc_value_index' introduced in 1b5d514
are only valid for a single report ID. If a touchscreen has multiple
reports with a HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT usage, its possible that the values
will not be correct for the report we're handling, resulting in an
incorrect value for 'num_expected'. This has been observed with the Cintiq
Companion 2.

To address this, we store the ID of the report those indicies are valid
for in a new  'cc_report' variable. Before using them to get the expected
contact count, we first check if the ID of the report we're processing
matches 'cc_report'. If it doesn't, we update the indicies to point to
the HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT usage of the current report (if it has one).
