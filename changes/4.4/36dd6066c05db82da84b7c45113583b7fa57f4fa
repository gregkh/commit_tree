ARM: dts: uniphier: change the external bus address mapping

In UniPhier SoCs before ProXstream2 and PH1-LD6b, two address spaces
 0x00000000 - 0x0fffffff
 0x40000000 - 0x4fffffff
are both mapped to the external bus (also called system bus),
so either was OK.

In the newest two SoCs, the former (0x00000000 - 0x0fffffff) is
assigned for the serial NOR interface.

For the consistency, use the latter for all the SoCs.

Also, fix the range properties to reflect the real address mapping,
where the support card is located at the offset address 0x01f00000
of CS1 of the external bus.
