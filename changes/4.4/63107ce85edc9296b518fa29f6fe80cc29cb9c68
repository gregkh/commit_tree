staging: comedi: comedi_fops.c: remove bogus kernel-doc for runflags

The comment before the `COMEDI_SRF_...` macros starts with a kernel-doc
mark but isn't valid kernel-doc.  There isn't a kernel-doc template for
a group of macro constants.  These macros are all private anyway, so
don't really need to be in kernel-doc.  Just change it to a normal
comment.
