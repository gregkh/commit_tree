hpsa: eliminate fake lun0 enclosures

We don't need to create fake enclosure devices at Lun0
in external target array configurations anymore.
This was done to support Pre-SCSI rev 5 controllers
that didn't suppoprt report luns commands, so the
SCSI layer had to scan targets. If there was no
LUN at LUN 0, then the target scan would stop, and
move to the next target.  Lun0 enclosure device
was added to prevent sparsely-numbered LUNs from
being missed.
