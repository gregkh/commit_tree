usb: dwc2: host: wait 3ms for controller stabilization

Some high speed mass storage devices fail to enumerate with following
error:

Cannot enable port %i.  Maybe the USB cable is bad?

This happens only when the device is plugged while the controller
is in hibernation state. After exiting hibernation, the controller
detects the device as a low speed device and fail to enumerate it.

Problem occurs only if HPRT0.PWR bit is programmed in a too short
delay after exiting hibernation. Dumping hprt register in
_dwc2_hcd_resume() directly after dwc2_exit_hibernation() shows that
HPRT0.LNSTS (D+/D- level) becomes valid approximately 2ms after
exiting hibernation.

Since dwc2_exit_hibernation() is called from atomic context, move the
delay out of this function.

Delay value is experimental and not mentioned in Synopsys
documentation. To be on the safe side 3ms delay is used.
