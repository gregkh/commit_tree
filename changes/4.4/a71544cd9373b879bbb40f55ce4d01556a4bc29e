thermal: cpu_cooling: Remove usage of devm functions

In the function cpufreq_get_requested_power, the memory allocated
for load_cpu is live within the function only. And after the
allocation it is immediately freed with devm_kfree. There is no
need to allocate memory for load_cpu with devm function so replace
devm_kcalloc with kcalloc and devm_kfree with kfree.
