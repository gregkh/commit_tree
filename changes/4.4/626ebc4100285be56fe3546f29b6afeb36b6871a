memcg: flatten task_struct->memcg_oom

task_struct->memcg_oom is a sub-struct containing fields which are used
for async memcg oom handling.  Most task_struct fields aren't packaged
this way and it can lead to unnecessary alignment paddings.  This patch
flattens it.

* task.memcg_oom.memcg          -> task.memcg_in_oom
* task.memcg_oom.gfp_mask	-> task.memcg_oom_gfp_mask
* task.memcg_oom.order          -> task.memcg_oom_order
* task.memcg_oom.may_oom        -> task.memcg_may_oom

In addition, task.memcg_may_oom is relocated to where other bitfields are
which reduces the size of task_struct.
