toshiba_acpi: Change default Hotkey enabling value

The driver currently uses the hotkey enabling value of 0x09 to enable
hotkey events, but windows uses a different value (0x01).

All Toshiba laptops accept the following "hotkey" parameters:
0x01 - Enable hotkey and system events.
0x03 - Enable system events only.
0x09 - Enable hotkey events only.
0x0b - Disable (hotkey and system) events.

This patch changes the default hotkey enabling value from 0x09 to 0x01,
enabling both the hotkey and system events.
