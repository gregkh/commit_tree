ext4: optimize ext4_writepage() for attempted 4k delalloc writes

In cases where the file system block size is the same as the page
size, and ext4_writepage() is asked to write out a page which is
either has the unwritten bit set in the extent tree, or which does not
yet have a block assigned due to delayed allocation, we can bail out
early and, unlocking the page earlier and avoiding a round trip
through ext4_bio_write_page() with the attendant calls to
set_page_writeback() and redirty_page_for_writeback().
