spi: bcm2835aux: add bcm2835 auxiliary spi device driver

The bcm2835 has 2 auxiliary spi bus masters spi1 and spi2.

This implements the driver to enable these devices.

The driver does not implement native chip-selects but uses
the aribtrary GPIO-chip-selects provided by the spi-chipselect.

Note that this driver relies on the fact that
the clock is implemented by the clk-bcm2835-aux driver,
which enables/disables the HW block when requesting/releasing
the clock.
