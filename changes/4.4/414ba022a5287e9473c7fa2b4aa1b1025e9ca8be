ALSA: firewire-lib: add support arbitrary value for fmt/fdf fields in CIP header

Some vendor specific protocol uses its own value for fmt/fdf fields in
CIP header.

This commit support to set arbitrary values for the fields.

In IEC 61883-6, NO-DATA code is defined for FDF field. A packet with this
code includes no data even if it includes some data blocks. This commit
still leaves a condition to handle this special packet.
