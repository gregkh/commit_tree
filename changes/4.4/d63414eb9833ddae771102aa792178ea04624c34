Staging: lustre: obdclass: obd_config: Declare as static

Declare class_add_conn, class_add_profile, class_cleanup,
class_config_parse_rec, class_del_conn, class_detach, class_match_param,
class_attach, class_setup as static since they are used only in this
particular file. Also remove the corresponding declarations from
header files.
