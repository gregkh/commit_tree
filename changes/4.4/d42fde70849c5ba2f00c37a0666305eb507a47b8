iommu/vt-d: Clean up pasid_enabled() and ecs_enabled() dependencies

When booted with intel_iommu=ecs_off we were still allocating the PASID
tables even though we couldn't actually use them. We really want to make
the pasid_enabled() macro depend on ecs_enabled().

Which is unfortunate, because currently they're the other way round to
cope with the Broadwell/Skylake problems with ECS.

Instead of having ecs_enabled() depend on pasid_enabled(), which was never
something that made me happy anyway, make it depend in the normal case
on the "broken PASID" bit 28 *not* being set.

Then pasid_enabled() can depend on ecs_enabled() as it should. And we also
don't need to mess with it if we ever see an implementation that has some
features requiring ECS (like PRI) but which *doesn't* have PASID support.
