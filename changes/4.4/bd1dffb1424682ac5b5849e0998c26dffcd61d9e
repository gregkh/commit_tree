hwrng: exynos - Fix missing configuration after suspend to RAM

After suspend to RAM the device stopped to work with ETIMEDOUT error:

$ dd if=/dev/hwrng of=/dev/null bs=1 count=16
dd: reading `/dev/hwrng': Connection timed out

In the STATUS register the bits #5 (PRNG_DONE) and #1
(SEED_SETTING_DONE) were not set. Instead PRNG_ERROR (seventh bit) was
high.

After each system suspend initialize the seed to fix the error.
