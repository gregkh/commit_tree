dm switch: simplify conditional in alloc_region_table()

The variable sctx->nr_regions has type unsigned long and the variable
nr_regions has type sector_t.

Thus the variables may be different when overflow happens.
Changed the conditional to "if (nr_regions >= ULONG_MAX)".
Also move the assignment of nr_regions after sector_div()
and the sanity check which looks more sane.
