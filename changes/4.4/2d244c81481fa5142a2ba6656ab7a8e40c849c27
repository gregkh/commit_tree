i2c: designware: fix IO timeout issue for AMD controller

Because of some hardware limitation, AMD I2C controller can't
trigger pending interrupt if interrupt status has been changed
after clearing interrupt status bits. Then, I2C will lost
interrupt and IO timeout.

According to hardware design, this patch implements a workaround
to disable i2c controller interrupt and re-enable i2c interrupt
before exiting ISR.

To reduce the performance impacts on other vendors, use unlikely
function to check flag in ISR.
