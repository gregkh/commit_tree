qed: Add module with basic common support

The Qlogic Everest Driver is the backend module for the QL4xxx ethernet
products by Qlogic.

This module serves two main purposes:
 1. It's responsible to contain all the common code that will be shared
    between the various drivers that would be used with said line of
    products. Flows such as chip initialization and de-initialization
    fall under this category.

 2. It would abstract the protocol-specific HW & FW components, allowing
    the protocol drivers to have a clean APIs which is detached in its
    slowpath configuration from the actual HSI.

This adds a very basic module without any protocol-specific bits.
I.e., this adds a basic implementation that almost entirely falls under
the first category.
