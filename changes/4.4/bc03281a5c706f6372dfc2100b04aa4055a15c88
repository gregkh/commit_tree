ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Remove BE copier blob memcpy

The BE copier private data allowed endpoint configuration blobs, now these
are queried from BIOS, we don't need to copy the blob, but only capability.

Removing the blob from private data will not allocate memory for module
specific config in which case memcpy will fail. Fix is to assign the ptr
queried from the NHLT table for the endpoint configuration.
