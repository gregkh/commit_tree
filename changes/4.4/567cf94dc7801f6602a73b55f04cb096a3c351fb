powerpc/book3e-64/kexec: Enable SMP release

The SMP release mechanism for FSL book3e is different from when booting
with normal hardware.  In theory we could simulate the normal spin
table mechanism, but not at the addresses U-Boot put in the device tree
-- so there'd need to be even more communication between the kernel and
kexec to set that up.  Instead, kexec-tools will set a boolean property
linux,booted-from-kexec in the /chosen node.
