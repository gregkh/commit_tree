fou: clean up socket with kfree_rcu

fou->udp_offloads is managed by RCU. As it is actually included inside
the fou sockets, we cannot let the memory go out of scope before a grace
period. We either can synchronize_rcu or switch over to kfree_rcu to
manage the sockets. kfree_rcu seems appropriate as it is used by vxlan
and geneve.
