HID: hid-gfrm: avoid warning for input_configured API change

The input_configured callback was recently changed to return
an 'int', but the newly added driver uses the old API:

drivers/hid/hid-gfrm.c:151:22: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]

This changes the driver like the other ones.
