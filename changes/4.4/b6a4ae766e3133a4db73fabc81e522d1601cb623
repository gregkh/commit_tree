rcu: Use rcu_callback_t in call_rcu*() and friends

As we now have rcu_callback_t typedefs as the type of rcu callbacks, we
should use it in call_rcu*() and friends as the type of parameters. This
could save us a few lines of code and make it clear which function
requires an rcu callbacks rather than other callbacks as its argument.

Besides, this can also help cscope to generate a better database for
code reading.
