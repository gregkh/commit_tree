drm/i915: Change SRM, LRM instructions to use correct length

MI_STORE_REGISTER_MEM, MI_LOAD_REGISTER_MEM instructions are not really
variable length instructions unlike MI_LOAD_REGISTER_IMM where it expects
(reg, addr) pairs so use fixed length for these instructions.

v2: rebase

[danvet: Appease checkpatch as Mika spotted in i915_reg.h - it seems
terminally unhappy about i915_cmd_parser.c so that would be a separate
patch.]
