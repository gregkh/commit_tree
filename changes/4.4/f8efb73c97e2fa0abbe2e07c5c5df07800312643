mpls: multipath route support

This patch adds support for MPLS multipath routes.

Includes following changes to support multipath:
- splits struct mpls_route into 'struct mpls_route + struct mpls_nh'

- 'struct mpls_nh' represents a mpls nexthop label forwarding entry

- moves mpls route and nexthop structures into internal.h

- A mpls_route can point to multiple mpls_nh structs

- the nexthops are maintained as a array (similar to ipv4 fib)

- In the process of restructuring, this patch also consistently changes
  all labels to u8

- Adds support to parse/fill RTA_MULTIPATH netlink attribute for
multipath routes similar to ipv4/v6 fib

- In this patch, the multipath route nexthop selection algorithm
simply returns the first nexthop. It is replaced by a
hash based algorithm from Robert Shearman in the next patch

- mpls_route_update cleanup: remove 'dev' handling in mpls_route_update.
mpls_route_update though implemented to update based on dev, it was
never used that way. And the dev handling gets tricky with multiple
nexthops. Cannot match against any single nexthops dev. So, this patch
removes the unused 'dev' handling in mpls_route_update.

- dead route/path handling will be implemented in a subsequent patch

Example:

$ip -f mpls route add 100 nexthop as 200 via inet 10.1.1.2 dev swp1 \
                nexthop as 700 via inet 10.1.1.6 dev swp2 \
                nexthop as 800 via inet 40.1.1.2 dev swp3

$ip  -f mpls route show
100
        nexthop as to 200 via inet 10.1.1.2  dev swp1
        nexthop as to 700 via inet 10.1.1.6  dev swp2
        nexthop as to 800 via inet 40.1.1.2  dev swp3
