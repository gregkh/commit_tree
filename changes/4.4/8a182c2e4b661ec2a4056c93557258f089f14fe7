PCI: mvebu: Use gpio_desc to carry around gpio

Use a gpio_desc to carry around the gpio, so we can then make use of the
GPIOF_ACTIVE_LOW property rather than carrying that around as well.  This
also avoids needing to use gpio_is_valid() to check whether we have a GPIO;
checking for a non-NULL descriptor is simpler.
