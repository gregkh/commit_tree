parisc: Add defines for Huge page support

Huge pages on parisc will have the same size as one pmd table, which
is on a 64bit kernel 2MB on a kernel with 4K kernel page sizes, and
on a 32bit kernel 4MB when used with 4K kernel pages.

Since parisc does not physically supports 2MB huge page sizes, emulate
it with two consecutive 1MB page sizes instead. Keeping the same huge
page size as one pmd will allow us to add transparent huge page support
later on.

Bit 21 in the pte flags was unused and will now be used to mark a page
as huge page (_PAGE_HPAGE_BIT).
