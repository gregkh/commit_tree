ftrace/scripts: Have recordmcount copy the object file

Russell King found that he had weird side effects when compiling the kernel
with hard linked ccache. The reason was that recordmcount modified the
kernel in place via mmap, and when a file gets modified twice by
recordmcount, it will complain about it. To fix this issue, Russell wrote a
patch that checked if the file was hard linked more than once and would
unlink it if it was.

Linus Torvalds was not happy with the fact that recordmcount does this in
place modification. Instead of doing the unlink only if the file has two or
more hard links, it does the unlink all the time. In otherwords, it always
does a copy if it changed something. That is, it does the write out if a
change was made.
