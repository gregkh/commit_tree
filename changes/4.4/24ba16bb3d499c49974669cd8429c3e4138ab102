xfs: clear PF_NOFREEZE for xfsaild kthread

Since xfsaild has been converted to kthread in 0030807c, it calls
try_to_freeze() during every AIL push iteration. It however doesn't set
itself as freezable, and therefore this try_to_freeze() will never do
anything.

Before (hopefully eventually) kthread freezing gets converted to fileystem
freezing, we'd rather mark xfsaild freezable (as it can generate I/O
during suspend).
