KVM: x86: zero apic_arb_prio on reset

BSP doesn't get INIT so its apic_arb_prio isn't zeroed after reboot.
BSP won't get lowest priority interrupts until other VCPUs get enough
interrupts to match their pre-reboot apic_arb_prio.

That behavior doesn't fit into KVM's round-robin-like interpretation of
lowest priority delivery ... userspace should KVM_SET_LAPIC on reset, so
just zero apic_arb_prio there.
