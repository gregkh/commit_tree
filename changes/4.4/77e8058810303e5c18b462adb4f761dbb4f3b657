spi: bugfix: spi_message.transfer_length does not get reset

When submitting an identical spi_message multiple times via spi_sync
the spi_message.frame_length does not get reset to 0 in __spi_validate
before adding up all spi_transfer.len resulting in
frame_length > actual_length on all but the first spi_sync call.
