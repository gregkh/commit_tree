arm64: Move cpu feature detection code

This patch moves the CPU feature detection code from
 arch/arm64/kernel/{setup.c to cpufeature.c}

The plan is to consolidate all the CPU feature handling
in cpufeature.c.

Apart from changing pr_fmt from "alternatives" to "cpu features",
there are no functional changes.
