drivers: firmware: psci: add PSCI v1.0 DT bindings

PSCI 1.0 is designed to be fully compliant to the PSCI 0.2
specification, with minor differences that are described in the
PSCI specification.

In particular, PSCI v1.0 augments the specification with a new
power_state format (extended stateid - probeable through the
PSCI_FEATURES call), changes some function return codes and
functions usage requirements wrt PSCI 0.2. These changes mean
that 1.0 vs 0.2 compliancy should be enforced through a DT
compatible string that allows firmware to specify 1.0 only
compliancy so that older kernels are prevented from using
PSCI 1.0 FW implementations in a non-compatible way (eg by
calling a 1.0 FW implementation and expecting 0.2 behaviour).

This patch adds PSCI 1.0 DT bindings and related compatible
string.
