drm/amdgpu: Drop unnecessary #include <linux/vga_switcheroo.h>

This was added to two radeon files even though they don't use any
vga_switcheroo symbols, the amdgpu fork inherited them:

Added to amdgpu_acpi.c by commit d7a2952f1ade ("drm/radeon: Add
support for the ATIF ACPI method to the radeon driver").

Added to amdgpu_bios.c by commit 6a9ee8af344e ("vga_switcheroo:
initial implementation (v15)").
