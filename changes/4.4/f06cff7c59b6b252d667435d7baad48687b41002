perf annotate: Don't die() when finding an invalid config option

The perf_config() infrastructure we inherited from git calls die() when
the provided config callback returns -1, meaning some key in a config
section is unexpected, that seems ok for a stdio based tool, but in
--tui we end up messing up the output, so just tell the user about the
error, wait for a keystroke and return 0, being more resilient and
proceeding with what we managed to parse.

That die() needs to die, tho :-)
