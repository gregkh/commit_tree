x86/asm: Remove the xyz_cfi macros from dwarf2.h

They are currently unused, and I don't think that anyone was
ever particularly happy with them.  They had the unfortunate
property that they made it easy to CFI-annotate things without
thinking about them -- when pushing, do you want to just update
the CFA offset, or do you also want to update the saved location
of the register being pushed?
