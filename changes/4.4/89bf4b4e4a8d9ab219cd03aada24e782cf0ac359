xenbus: Support multiple grants ring with 64KB

The PV ring may use multiple grants and expect them to be mapped
contiguously in the virtual memory.

Although, the current code is relying on a Linux page will be mapped to
a single grant. On build where Linux is using a different page size than
the grant (i.e other than 4KB), the grant will always be mapped on the
first 4KB of each Linux page which make the final ring not contiguous in
the memory.

This can be fixed by mapping multiple grant in a same Linux page.
