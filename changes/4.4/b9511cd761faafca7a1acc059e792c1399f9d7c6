perf/x86: Fix time_shift in perf_event_mmap_page

Commit:

  b20112edeadf ("perf/x86: Improve accuracy of perf/sched clock")

allowed the time_shift value in perf_event_mmap_page to be as much
as 32.  Unfortunately the documented algorithms for using time_shift
have it shifting an integer, whereas to work correctly with the value
32, the type must be u64.

In the case of perf tools, Intel PT decodes correctly but the timestamps
that are output (for example by perf script) have lost 32-bits of
granularity so they look like they are not changing at all.

Fix by limiting the shift to 31 and adjusting the multiplier accordingly.

Also update the documentation of perf_event_mmap_page so that new code
based on it will be more future-proof.
