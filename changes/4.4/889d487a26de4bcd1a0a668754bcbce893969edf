rcutorture: Fix module unwind when bad torture_type specified

The rcutorture module has a list of torture types, and specifying a
type not on this list is supposed to cleanly fail the module load.
Unfortunately, the "fail" happens without the "cleanly".  This commit
therefore adds the needed clean-up after an incorrect torture_type.
