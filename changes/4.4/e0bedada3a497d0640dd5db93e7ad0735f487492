s390/ipl: fix out of bounds access in scpdata_write

The input buffer in reipl_fcp_scpdata_write is accessed out of bounds
when an offset is specified. The problem is that the offset refers to
the data we should write to and not to the buffer we read from.

So instead of
        memcpy(scp_data, buf + off, count);
we could just do
        memcpy(scp_data + off, buf, count);

However we not only modify the data but also store its length. For this to
work we'd need to remember a state per open FH. Since that's not possible
with sysfs callbacks let's just fail when an offset is specified.
