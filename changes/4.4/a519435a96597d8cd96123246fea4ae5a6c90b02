dma-buf/fence: add fence_wait_any_timeout function v2

Waiting for the first fence in an array of fences to signal.

This is useful for device driver specific resource managers
and also Vulkan needs something similar.

v2: more parameter checks, handling for timeout==0,
    remove NULL entry support, better callback removal.
