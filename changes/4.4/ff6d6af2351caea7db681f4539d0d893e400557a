xfs: per-filesystem stats counter implementation

This patch modifies the stats counting macros and the callers
to those macros to properly increment, decrement, and add-to
the xfs stats counts. The counts for global and per-fs stats
are correctly advanced, and cleared by writing a "1" to the
corresponding clear file.

global counts: /sys/fs/xfs/stats/stats
per-fs counts: /sys/fs/xfs/sda*/stats/stats

global clear:  /sys/fs/xfs/stats/stats_clear
per-fs clear:  /sys/fs/xfs/sda*/stats/stats_clear

[dchinner: cleaned up macro variables, removed CONFIG_FS_PROC around
 stats structures and macros. ]
