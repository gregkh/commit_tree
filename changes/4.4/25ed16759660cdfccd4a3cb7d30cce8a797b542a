KVM: s390: factor out and fix setting of guest TOD clock

Let's move that whole logic into one function. We now always use unsigned
values when calculating the epoch (to avoid over/underflow defined).
Also, we always have to get all VCPUs out of SIE before doing the update
to avoid running differing VCPUs with different TODs.
