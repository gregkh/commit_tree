can: fix assignment of error location in CAN error messages

As Dan Carpenter reported in http://marc.info/?l=linux-can&m=144793696016187
the assignment of the error location in CAN error messages had some bit wise
overlaps. Indeed the value to be assigned in data[3] is no bitfield but defines
a single value which points to a location inside the CAN frame on the wire.

This patch fixes the assignments for the error locations in error messages.
