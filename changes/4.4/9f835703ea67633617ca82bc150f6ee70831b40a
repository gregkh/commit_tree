mm/slub: calculate start order with reserved in consideration

In slub_order(), the order starts from max(min_order,
get_order(min_objects * size)).  When (min_objects * size) has different
order from (min_objects * size + reserved), it will skip this order via a
check in the loop.

This patch optimizes this a little by calculating the start order with
`reserved' in consideration and removing the check in loop.
