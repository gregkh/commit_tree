drm: bridge/dw_hdmi-ahb-audio: parse ELD from HDMI driver

Parse the ELD (EDID like data) stored from the HDMI driver to restrict
the sample rates and channels which are available to ALSA.  This causes
the ALSA device to reflect the capabilities of the overall audio path,
not just what is supported at the HDMI source interface level.
