memcg: drop unnecessary cold-path tests from __memcg_kmem_bypass()

__memcg_kmem_bypass() decides whether a kmem allocation should be bypassed
to the root memcg.  Some conditions that it tests are valid criteria
regarding who should be held accountable; however, there are a couple
unnecessary tests for cold paths - __GFP_FAIL and fatal_signal_pending().

The previous patch updated try_charge() to handle both __GFP_FAIL and
dying tasks correctly and the only thing these two tests are doing is
making accounting less accurate and sprinkling tests for cold path
conditions in the hot paths.  There's nothing meaningful gained by these
extra tests.

This patch removes the two unnecessary tests from __memcg_kmem_bypass().
