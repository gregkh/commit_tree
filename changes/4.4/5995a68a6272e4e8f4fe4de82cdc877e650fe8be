xen/privcmd: Add support for Linux 64KB page granularity

The hypercall interface (as well as the toolstack) is always using 4KB
page granularity. When the toolstack is asking for mapping a series of
guest PFN in a batch, it expects to have the page map contiguously in
its virtual memory.

When Linux is using 64KB page granularity, the privcmd driver will have
to map multiple Xen PFN in a single Linux page.

Note that this solution works on page granularity which is a multiple of
4KB.
