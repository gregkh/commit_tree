usb: dwc2: host: Fix remote wakeup when not in DWC2_L2

In commit 734643dfbdde ("usb: dwc2: host: add flag to reflect bus
state") we changed dwc2_port_suspend() not to set the lx_state
anymore (instead it sets the new bus_suspended variable).  This
introduced a bug where we would fail to detect device insertions if:

1. Plug empty hub into dwc2
2. Plug USB flash drive into the empty hub.
3. Wait a few seconds
4. Unplug USB flash drive
5. Less than 2 seconds after step 4, plug the USB flash drive in again.

The dwc2_hcd_rem_wakeup() function should have been changed to look at
the new bus_suspended variable.

Let's fix it.  Since commit b46146d59fda ("usb: dwc2: host: resume root
hub on remote wakeup") talks about needing the root hub resumed if the
bus was suspended, we'll include it in our test.

It appears that the "port_l1_change" should only be set to 1 if we were
in DWC2_L1 (the driver currently never sets this), so we'll update the
former "else" case based on this test.
