leds: netxbig: add device tree binding

This patch adds device tree support for the netxbig LEDs.

This also introduces a additionnal DT binding for the GPIO extension bus
(netxbig-gpio-ext) used to configure the LEDs. Since this bus could also
be used to control other devices, then it seems more suitable to have it
in a separate DT binding.
