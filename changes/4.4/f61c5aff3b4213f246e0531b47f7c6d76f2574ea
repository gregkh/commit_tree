staging: wilc1000: remove typedef from the linux_wlan_t

This patch removes typedef from the struct linux_wlan_t and renames it
to the wilc. In addition, all of linux_wlan_t is replaced with struct wilc
and memory allocation style is changed with preferred form as well like the
following:
	p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), ...) where "struct wilc" is used
