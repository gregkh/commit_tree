qlcnic: constify qlcnic_mbx_ops structure

The only instance of a qlcnic_mbx_ops structure is never modified.  Thus
the declaration of the structure and all references to the structure type
can be made const.

In the definition of the qlcnic_mailbox structure, the ops field is no
longer lined up with the other fields.  This was left as is, to avoid a lot
of trivial changes on the other lines.

Done with the help of Coccinelle.
