drivers/net/ethernet: make ti/cpsw-phy-sel.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/net/ethernet/ti/Kconfig:config TI_CPSW_PHY_SEL
drivers/net/ethernet/ti/Kconfig:        bool "TI CPSW Switch Phy sel Support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modularity so that when reading the
driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
