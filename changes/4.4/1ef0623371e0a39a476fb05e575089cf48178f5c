kernel-doc: Make it compatible with Perl versions below 5.12 again

Changeset 4d73270192ec('scripts/kernel-doc: Replacing highlights
hash by an array') broke compatibility of the kernel-doc script with
older versions of perl by using "keys ARRAY" syntax with is available
only on Perl 5.12 or newer, according with:
	http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/keys.html

Restore backward compatibility by replacing "foreach my $k (keys ARRAY)"
by a C-like variant: "for (my $k = 0; $k < !ARRAY; $k++)"
