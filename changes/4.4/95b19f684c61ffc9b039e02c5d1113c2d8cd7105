locking/percpu-rwsem: Make percpu_free_rwsem() after kzalloc() safe

This is the temporary ugly hack which will be reverted later. We only
need it to ensure that the next patch will not break "change sb_writers
to use percpu_rw_semaphore" patches routed via the VFS tree.

The alloc_super()->destroy_super() error path assumes that it is safe
to call percpu_free_rwsem() after kzalloc() without percpu_init_rwsem(),
so let's not disappoint it.
