arm64: mm: remove unused cpu_set_idmap_tcr_t0sz function

With commit b08d4640a3dc ("arm64: remove dead code"),
cpu_set_idmap_tcr_t0sz is no longer called and can therefore be removed
from the kernel.

This patch removes the function and effectively inlines the helper
function __cpu_set_tcr_t0sz into cpu_set_default_tcr_t0sz.
