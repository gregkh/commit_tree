perf probe: Fix a segfault when removing uprobe events

Fix a segfault bug and a small mistake in perf probe -d.

Since the "ulist" in perf_del_probe_events is never initialized,
strlist__add(ulist, *) always causes a segfault when removing
uprobe events by perf probe -d.

Also, the "str" local variable is never released if fail to
allocate the "klist". This fixes it too.

This has been introduced by the commit e607f1426b58 ("perf probe:
Print deleted events in cmd_probe()").
