ALSA: firewire-tascam: Turn on/off FireWire LED

TASCAM FireWire series has some LEDs on its surface. These LEDs can be
turned on/off by receiving asynchronous transactions to a certain
address. One of the LEDs is labels as 'FireWire'. It's better to light it
up when this driver starts to work. Besides, the LED for 'FireWire' is
turned off at bus reset.

This commit implements this idea.
