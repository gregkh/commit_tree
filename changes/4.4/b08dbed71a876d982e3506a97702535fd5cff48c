iwlwifi: mvm: use short timeouts in P2P low latency if supported

Those timeouts are used for AM-to-PSM transition.
We already have those pairs defined for default and WOWLAN use cases.
We expect that by using shorter threshold for low latency P2P,
e.g. for Miracast video scenario, we might save a considerable amount of power.
