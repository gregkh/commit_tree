ipv6: no CHECKSUM_PARTIAL on MSG_MORE corked sockets

We cannot reliable calculate packet size on MSG_MORE corked sockets
and thus cannot decide if they are going to be fragmented later on,
so better not use CHECKSUM_PARTIAL in the first place.

The IPv6 code also intended to protect and not use CHECKSUM_PARTIAL in
the existence of IPv6 extension headers, but the condition was wrong. Fix
it up, too. Also the condition to check whether the packet fits into
one fragment was wrong and has been corrected.

Fixes: commit 32dce968dd987 ("ipv6: Allow for partial checksums on non-ufo packets")
