drm/i915: Dont -ETIMEDOUT on identical new and previous (count, crc).

By Vesa DP 1.2 spec TEST_CRC_COUNT is a "4 bit wrap counter which
increments each time the TEST_CRC_x_x are updated."

However if we are trying to verify the screen hasn't changed we get
same (count, crc) pair twice. Without this patch we would return
-ETIMEOUT in this case.

So, if in 6 vblanks the pair (count, crc) hasn't changed we
return it anyway instead of returning error and let test case decide
if it was right or not.
