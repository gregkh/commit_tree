f2fs: use atomic64_t for extent cache hit stat

Our hit stat of extent cache will increase all the time until remount,
and we use atomic_t type for the stat variable, so it may easily incur
overflow when we query extent cache frequently in a long time running
fs.

So to avoid that, this patch uses atomic64_t for hit stat variables.
