perf tools: Make sure fixdep is built before libbpf

While doing 'make -C tools/perf build-test':

   LD       fixdep-in.o
   LINK     fixdep
 /bin/sh: /home/acme/git/linux/tools/build/fixdep: Permission denied
 make[6]: *** [bpf.o] Error 1
 make[5]: *** [libbpf-in.o] Error 2
 make[4]: *** [/home/acme/git/linux/tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.a] Error 2
 make[4]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

The fixdep tool needs to be built as the first binary.  Libraries are
built in paralel, so each of them needs to depend on fixdep target.
