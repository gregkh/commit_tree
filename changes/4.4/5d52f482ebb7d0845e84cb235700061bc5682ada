iommu/vt-d: Fix SVM IOTLB flush handling

Change the 'pages' parameter to 'unsigned long' to avoid overflow.

Fix the device-IOTLB flush parameter calculation â€” the size of the IOTLB
flush is indicated by the position of the least significant zero bit in
the address field. For example, a value of 0x12345f000 will flush from
0x123440000 to 0x12347ffff (256KiB).

Finally, the cap_pgsel_inv() is not relevant to SVM; the spec says that
*all* implementations must support page-selective invaliation for
"first-level" translations. So don't check for it.
