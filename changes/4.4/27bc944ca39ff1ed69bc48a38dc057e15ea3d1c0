dmaengine: bcm2835-dma: Convert to use DMA pool

f93178291712 dmaengine: bcm2835-dma: Fix memory leak when stopping a
	     running transfer

Fixed the memleak, but introduced another issue: the terminate_all callback
might be called with interrupts disabled and the dma_free_coherent() is
not allowed to be called when IRQs are disabled.
Convert the driver to use dma_pool_* for managing the list of control
blocks for the transfer.
