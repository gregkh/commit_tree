KVM: s390: disabled wait cares about machine checks, not PER

We don't care about program event recording irqs (synchronous
program irqs) but asynchronous irqs when checking for disabled
wait. Machine checks were missing.

Let's directly switch to the functions we have for that purpose
instead of testing once again for magic bits.
