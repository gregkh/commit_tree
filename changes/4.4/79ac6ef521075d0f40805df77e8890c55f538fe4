tracing: Use kstrdup_const instead of private implementation

The kernel now has kstrdup_const/kfree_const for reusing .rodata
(typically string literals) when possible; there's no reason to
duplicate that logic in the tracing system. Moreover, as the comment
above core_kernel_data states, it may not always return true for
.rodata - that is for example the case on x86_64, where we thus end up
kstrdup'ing all the passed-in strings.

Arguably, testing for .rodata explicitly (as kstrdup_const does) is
also more correct: I don't think one is supposed to be able to change
the name after creating the event_subsystem by passing the address of
a static char (but non-const) array.
