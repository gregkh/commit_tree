mm: page migration fix PageMlocked on migrated pages

Commit e6c509f85455 ("mm: use clear_page_mlock() in page_remove_rmap()")
in v3.7 inadvertently made mlock_migrate_page() impotent: page migration
unmaps the page from userspace before migrating, and that commit clears
PageMlocked on the final unmap, leaving mlock_migrate_page() with
nothing to do.  Not a serious bug, the next attempt at reclaiming the
page would fix it up; but a betrayal of page migration's intent - the
new page ought to emerge as PageMlocked.

I don't see how to fix it for mlock_migrate_page() itself; but easily
fixed in remove_migration_pte(), by calling mlock_vma_page() when the vma
is VM_LOCKED - under pte lock as in try_to_unmap_one().

Delete mlock_migrate_page()?  Not quite, it does still serve a purpose for
migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page(): where we could replace it by a test,
clear_page_mlock(), mlock_vma_page() sequence; but would that be an
improvement?  mlock_migrate_page() is fairly lean, and let's make it
leaner by skipping the irq save/restore now clearly not needed.
