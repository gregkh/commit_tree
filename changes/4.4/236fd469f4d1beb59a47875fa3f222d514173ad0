mfd: intel_quark_i2c_gpio: load gpio driver first

On Intel Galileo boards the GPIO expander is connected to i2c bus. Moreover it
is able to generate interrupt, but interrupt line is connected to GPIO. That's
why we have to have GPIO driver in place when we will probe i2c host with
device connected to it.
