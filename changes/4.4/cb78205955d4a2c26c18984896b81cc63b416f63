dmaengine: edma: Allocate memory dynamically for bitmaps and structures

Instead of using defines to specify the size of different arrays and
bitmaps, allocate the memory for them based on the information we get from
the HW itself.
Since these defines are set based on the worst case, there are devices
where they are not valid.
