drm/i915: add MISSING_CASE to a few port/aux power domain helpers

MISSING_CASE() would have been useful to track down a recent problem in
intel_display_port_aux_power_domain(), so add it there and a few related
helpers. This was also suggested by Ville in his review of the latest
DMC/DC changes, we forgot to address that.
