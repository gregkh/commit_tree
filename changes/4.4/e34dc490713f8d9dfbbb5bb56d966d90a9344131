regmap: debugfs: use snprintf return value in regmap_reg_ranges_read_file()

Calling strlen() no less than three times on entry is silly. Since
we're formatting into a buffer with plenty of room, there's no chance
of truncation, so snprintf() has actually returned the value we want,
meaning we don't even have to call strlen once.
