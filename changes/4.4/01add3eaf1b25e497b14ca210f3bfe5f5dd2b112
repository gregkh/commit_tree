perf/core: Split perf_event_read() and perf_event_count()

perf_event_read() does two things:

	- call the PMU to read/update the counter value, and
	- compute the total count of the event and its children

Not all callers need both. perf_event_reset() for instance needs the
first piece but doesn't need the second.  Similarly, when we implement
the ability to read a group of events using the transaction interface,
we would need the two pieces done independently.

Break up perf_event_read() and have it just read/update the counter
and have the callers compute the total count if necessary.
