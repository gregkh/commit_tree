net: mvneta: Allow different queues

The mvneta driver allows to change the default RX queue trough the rxq_def
kernel parameter.

However, the current code doesn't allow to have any value but 0. It is
actively checked for in the driver's probe because the drivers makes a
number of assumption and takes a number of shortcuts in order to just use
that RX queue.

Remove these limitations in order to be able to specify any available
queue.
