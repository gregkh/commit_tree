KVM: MTRR: treat memory as writeback if MTRR is disabled in guest CPUID

Virtual machines can be run with CPUID such that there are no MTRRs.
In that case, the firmware will never enable MTRRs and it is obviously
undesirable to run the guest entirely with UC memory.  Check out guest
CPUID, and use WB memory if MTRR do not exist.
