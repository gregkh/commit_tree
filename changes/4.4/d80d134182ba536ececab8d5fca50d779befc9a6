i2c: designware: Move common probe code into i2c_dw_probe()

There is some code duplication in i2c-designware-platdrv and
i2c-designware-pcidrv probe functions. What is even worse that duplication
requires i2c_dw_xfer(), i2c_dw_func() and i2c_dw_isr() i2c-designware-core
functions to be exported.

Therefore move common code into new i2c_dw_probe() and make functions above
local to i2c-designware-core.

While merging the code patch does following functional changes:

- I2C Adapter name will be "Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter". Previously it
  was used for platform and ACPI devices but PCI device used
  "i2c-designware-pci".
- Using device name for interrupt name. Previous it was platform device name,
  ACPI device name or "i2c-designware-pci".
- Error code from devm_request_irq() and i2c_add_numbered_adapter() will be
  printed in case of error.
