[media] vivid: Add an option to configure the maximum number of devices

The vivid driver currently has a hard-coded limit of 64 devices,
however there's nothing that prevents the creation of even more devices.
This commit adds a new driver option (which defaults to 64) to
allow this maximum number to be configurable.
