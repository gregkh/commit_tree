ACPI: Allow selection of the ACPI processor driver for ARM64

Now that the ACPI processor driver has been decoupled from
the C states and P states functionality, make it selectable on
ARM64 so that it can be used by others e.g. CPPC.

The C states and P states code is selected only on X86 or
IA64 until the relevant support is added on ARM64.
