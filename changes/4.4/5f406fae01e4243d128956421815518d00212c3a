lpfc: in sli3 use configured sg_seg_cnt for sg_tablesize

Currently the module parameter lpfc_sg_seg_count does not have effect
for sli3 devices.

In lpfc_sli_driver_resource_setup(), which is used for sli3, the code
writes the configured sg_seg_cnt into lpfc_template.sg_tablesize.
But lpfc_template is the template used for sli4 only. Thus the value should
correctly be written to lpfc_template_s3->sg_tablesize.

This patch is for kernel 4.1-rc5, but is tested with lpfc 10.2.405.26 only.
