ARC: smp: Introduce smp hook @init_irq_cpu called for all cores

Note this is not part of platform owned static machine_desc,
but more of device owned plat_smp_ops (rather misnamed) which a IPI
provider or some such typically defines.

This will help us seperate out the IPI registration from platform
specific init_cpu_smp() into device specific init_irq_cpu()
