sfc: push partner queue for skb->xmit_more

When the IP stack passes SKBs the sfc driver puts them in 2 different TX
queues (called partners), one for checksummed and one for not checksummed.
If the SKB has xmit_more set the driver will delay pushing the work to the
NIC.

When later it does decide to push the buffers this patch ensures it also
pushes the partner queue, if that also has any delayed work. Before this
fix the work in the partner queue would be left for a long time and cause
a netdev watchdog.
