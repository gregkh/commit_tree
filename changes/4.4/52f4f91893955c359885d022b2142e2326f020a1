mwifiex: avoid gettimeofday in ba_threshold setting

mwifiex_get_random_ba_threshold() uses a complex homegrown implementation
to generate a pseudo-random number from the current time as returned
from do_gettimeofday().

This currently requires two 32-bit divisions plus a couple of other
computations that are eventually discarded as only eight bits of
the microsecond portion are used at all.

We could replace this with a call to get_random_bytes(), but that
might drain the entropy pool too fast if this is called for each
packet.

Instead, this patch converts it to use ktime_get_ns(), which is a
bit faster than do_gettimeofday(), and then uses a similar algorithm
as before, but in a way that takes both the nanosecond and second
portion into account for slightly-more-but-still-not-very-random
pseudorandom number.
