arm64: Fix compat register mappings

For reasons not entirely apparent, but now enshrined in history, the
architectural mapping of AArch32 banked registers to AArch64 registers
actually orders SP_<mode> and LR_<mode> backwards compared to the
intuitive r13/r14 order, for all modes except FIQ.

Fix the compat_<reg>_<mode> macros accordingly, in the hope of avoiding
subtle bugs with KVM and AArch32 guests.
