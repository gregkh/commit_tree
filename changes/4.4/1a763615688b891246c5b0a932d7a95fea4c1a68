mm: loosen MADV_NOHUGEPAGE to enable Qemu postcopy on s390

MADV_NOHUGEPAGE processing is too restrictive.  kvm already disables
hugepage but hugepage_madvise() takes the error path when we ask to turn
on the MADV_NOHUGEPAGE bit and the bit is already on.  This causes Qemu's
new postcopy migration feature to fail on s390 because its first action is
to madvise the guest address space as NOHUGEPAGE.  This patch modifies the
code so that the operation succeeds without error now.

For consistency reasons do the same for MADV_HUGEPAGE.
