drivers/tty: make sysrq.c slightly more explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config.debug:config MAGIC_SYSRQ
      bool "Magic SysRq key"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the traces of modularity we can so that when reading the
driver there is less doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We don't delete the module.h include since other parts of the file are
using content from there.
