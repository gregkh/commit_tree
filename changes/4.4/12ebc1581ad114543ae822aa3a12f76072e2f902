mm,thp: introduce flush_pmd_tlb_range

ARCHes with special requirements for evicting THP backing TLB entries
can implement this.

Otherwise also, it can help optimize TLB flush in THP regime.
stock flush_tlb_range() typically has optimization to nuke the entire
TLB if flush span is greater than a certain threshhold, which will
likely be true for a single huge page. Thus a single thp flush will
invalidate the entrire TLB which is not desirable.

e.g. see arch/arc: flush_pmd_tlb_range
