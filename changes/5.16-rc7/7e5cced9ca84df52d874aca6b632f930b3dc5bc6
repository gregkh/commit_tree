net: accept UFOv6 packages in virtio_net_hdr_to_skb

Skb with skb->protocol 0 at the time of virtio_net_hdr_to_skb may have
a protocol inferred from virtio_net_hdr with virtio_net_hdr_set_proto.

Unlike TCP, UDP does not have separate types for IPv4 and IPv6. Type
VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP is guessed to be IPv4/UDP. As of the below
commit, UFOv6 packets are dropped due to not matching the protocol as
obtained from dev_parse_header_protocol.

Invert the test to take that L2 protocol field as starting point and
pass both UFOv4 and UFOv6 for VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP.

Fixes: 924a9bc362a5 ("net: check if protocol extracted by virtio_net_hdr_set_proto is correct")
