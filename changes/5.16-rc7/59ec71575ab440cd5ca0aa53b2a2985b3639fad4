ucounts: Fix rlimit max values check

The semantics of the rlimit max values differs from ucounts itself. When
creating a new userns, we store the current rlimit of the process in
ucount_max. Thus, the value of the limit in the parent userns is saved
in the created one.

The problem is that now we are taking the maximum value for counter from
the same userns. So for init_user_ns it will always be RLIM_INFINITY.

To fix the problem we need to check the counter value with the max value
stored in userns.

Reproducer:

su - test -c "ulimit -u 3; sleep 5 & sleep 6 & unshare -U --map-root-user sh -c 'sleep 7 & sleep 8 & date; wait'"
