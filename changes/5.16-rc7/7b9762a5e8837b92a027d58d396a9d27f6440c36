io_uring: zero iocb->ki_pos for stream file types

io_uring supports using offset == -1 for using the current file position,
and we read that in as part of read/write command setup. For the non-iter
read/write types we pass in NULL for the position pointer, but for the
iter types we should not be passing any anything but 0 for the position
for a stream.

Clear kiocb->ki_pos if the file is a stream, don't leave it as -1. If we
do, then the request will error with -ESPIPE.
