net/sched: flow_dissector: Fix matching on zone id for invalid conns

If ct rejects a flow, it removes the conntrack info from the skb.
act_ct sets the post_ct variable so the dissector will see this case
as an +tracked +invalid state, but the zone id is lost with the
conntrack info.

To restore the zone id on such cases, set the last executed zone,
via the tc control block, when passing ct, and read it back in the
dissector if there is no ct info on the skb (invalid connection).
