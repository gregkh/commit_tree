Input: i8042 - enable deferred probe quirk for ASUS UM325UA

The ASUS UM325UA suffers from the same issue as the ASUS UX425UA, which
is a very similar laptop. The i8042 device is not usable immediately
after boot and fails to initialize, requiring a deferred retry.

Enable the deferred probe quirk for the UM325UA.
