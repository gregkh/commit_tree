mmc: meson-mx-sdhc: Set MANUAL_STOP for multi-block SDIO commands

The vendor driver implements special handling for multi-block
SD_IO_RW_EXTENDED (and SD_IO_RW_DIRECT) commands which have data
attached to them. It sets the MANUAL_STOP bit in the MESON_SDHC_MISC
register for these commands. In all other cases this bit is cleared.
Here we omit SD_IO_RW_DIRECT since that command never has any data
attached to it.

This fixes SDIO wifi using the brcmfmac driver which reported the
following error without this change on a Netxeon S82 board using a
Meson8 (S802) SoC:
  brcmf_fw_alloc_request: using brcm/brcmfmac43362-sdio for chip
                          BCM43362/1

And with this change:

                          BCM43362/1
