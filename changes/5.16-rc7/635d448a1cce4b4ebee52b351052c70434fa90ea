net: openvswitch: Fix matching zone id for invalid conns arriving from tc

Zone id is not restored if we passed ct and ct rejected the connection,
as there is no ct info on the skb.

Save the zone from tc skb cb to tc skb extension and pass it on to
ovs, use that info to restore the zone id for invalid connections.
