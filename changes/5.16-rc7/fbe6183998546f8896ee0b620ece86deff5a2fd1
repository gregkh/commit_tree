Revert "x86/boot: Pull up cmdline preparation and early param parsing"

This reverts commit 8d48bf8206f77aa8687f0e241e901e5197e52423.

It turned out to be a bad idea as it broke supplying mem= cmdline
parameters due to parse_memopt() requiring preparatory work like setting
up the e820 table in e820__memory_setup() in order to be able to exclude
the range specified by mem=.

Pulling that up would've broken Xen PV again, see threads at

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210920120421.29276-1-jgross@suse.com

due to xen_memory_setup() needing the first reservations in
early_reserve_memory() - kernel and initrd - to have happened already.

This could be fixed again by having Xen do those reservations itself...

Long story short, revert this and do a simpler fix in a later patch.
