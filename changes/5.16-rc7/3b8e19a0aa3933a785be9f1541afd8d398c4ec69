drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf

In commit 41ca9caaae0b
("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add check for CEA modes only") a check
for CEA modes was added to function mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid()
in order to address possible issues on MT8167;
moreover, with commit c91026a938c2
("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock")
another similar check was introduced.

Unfortunately though, at the time of writing, MT8173 does not provide
any mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this is crashing the kernel with NULL
pointer upon entering mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(), which happens as
soon as a HDMI cable gets plugged in.

To fix this regression, add a NULL pointer check for hdmi->conf in the
said function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULL pointer
kernel panics.
