hwmon: (lm90) Drop critical attribute support for MAX6654

Tests with a real chip and a closer look into the datasheet show that
MAX6654 does not support CRIT/THERM/OVERTEMP limits, so drop support
of the respective attributes for this chip.

Introduce LM90_HAVE_CRIT flag and use it to instantiate critical limit
attributes to solve the problem.
