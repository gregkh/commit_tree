net: skip virtio_net_hdr_set_proto if protocol already set

virtio_net_hdr_set_proto infers skb->protocol from the virtio_net_hdr
gso_type, to avoid packets getting dropped for lack of a proto type.

Its protocol choice is a guess, especially in the case of UFO, where
the single VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP label covers both UFOv4 and UFOv6.

Skip this best effort if the field is already initialized. Whether
explicitly from userspace, or implicitly based on an earlier call to
dev_parse_header_protocol (which is more robust, but was introduced
after this patch).
