platform/x86/intel: Remove X86_PLATFORM_DRIVERS_INTEL

While introduction of this menu brings a nice view in the configuration tools,
it brought more issues than solves, i.e. it prevents to locate files in the
intel/ subfolder without touching non-related Kconfig dependencies elsewhere.
Drop X86_PLATFORM_DRIVERS_INTEL altogether.

Note, on x86 it's enabled by default and it's quite unlikely anybody wants to
disable all of the modules in this submenu.
