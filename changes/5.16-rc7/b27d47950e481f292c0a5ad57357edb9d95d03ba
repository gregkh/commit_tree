xen/netfront: harden netfront against event channel storms

The Xen netfront driver is still vulnerable for an attack via excessive
number of events sent by the backend. Fix that by using lateeoi event
channels.

For being able to detect the case of no rx responses being added while
the carrier is down a new lock is needed in order to update and test
rsp_cons and the number of seen unconsumed responses atomically.

This is part of XSA-391
