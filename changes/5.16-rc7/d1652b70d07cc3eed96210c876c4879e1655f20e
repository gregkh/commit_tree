asix: fix wrong return value in asix_check_host_enable()

If asix_read_cmd() returns 0 on 30th interation, 0 will be returned from
asix_check_host_enable(), which is logically wrong. Fix it by returning
-ETIMEDOUT explicitly if we have exceeded 30 iterations

Also, replaced 30 with #define as suggested by Andrew
