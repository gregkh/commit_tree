mmc: core: Disable card detect during shutdown

It's seems prone to problems by allowing card detect and its corresponding
mmc_rescan() work to run, during platform shutdown. For example, we may end
up turning off the power while initializing a card, which potentially could
damage it.

To avoid this scenario, let's add ->shutdown_pre() callback for the mmc host
class device and then turn of the card detect from there.
