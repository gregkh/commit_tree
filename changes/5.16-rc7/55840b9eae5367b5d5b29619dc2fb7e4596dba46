hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer overflow/underflow in hysteresis calculations

Commit b50aa49638c7 ("hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer underflows of
temperature calculations") addressed a number of underflow situations
when writing temperature limits. However, it missed one situation, seen
when an attempt is made to set the hysteresis value to MAX_LONG and the
critical temperature limit is negative.

Use clamp_val() when setting the hysteresis temperature to ensure that
the provided value can never overflow or underflow.
