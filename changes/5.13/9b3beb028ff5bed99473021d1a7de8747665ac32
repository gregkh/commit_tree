xfs: remove the di_dmevmask and di_dmstate fields from struct xfs_icdinode

The legacy DMAPI fields were never set by upstream Linux XFS, and have no
way to be read using the kernel APIs.  So instead of bloating the in-core
inode for them just copy them from the on-disk inode into the log when
logging the inode.  The only caveat is that we need to make sure to zero
the fields for newly read or deleted inodes, which is solved using a new
flag in the inode.
