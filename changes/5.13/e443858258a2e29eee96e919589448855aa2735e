ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: enable async suspend

The skylake driver disabled async suspend to prevent disabling
the DSP before the card was suspended during system suspend.
This code was carried over to the SOF driver. But, there is no
risk of the DSP getting disabled before the card is suspended
with the SOF driver. Therefore, it is safe to enable async suspend
and thereby optimize the system resume time.
