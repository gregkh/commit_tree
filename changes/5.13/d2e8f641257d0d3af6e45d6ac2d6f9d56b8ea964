ALSA: usb-audio: Explicitly set up the clock selector

In the current code, we have some assumption that the audio clock
selector has been set up implicitly and don't want to touch it unless
it's really needed for the fallback autoclock setup.  This works for
most devices but some seem having a problem.  Partially this was
covered for the devices with a single connector at the initialization
phase (commit 086b957cc17f "ALSA: usb-audio: Skip the clock selector
inquiry for single connections"), but also there are cases where the
wrong clock set up is kept silently.  The latter seems to be the cause
of the noises on Behringer devices.

In this patch, we explicitly set up the audio clock selector whenever
the appropriate node is found.
