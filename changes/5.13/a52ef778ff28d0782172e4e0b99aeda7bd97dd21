arm64: smp: Add missing prototype for some smp.c functions

In commit eb631bb5bf5b
("arm64: Support arch_irq_work_raise() via self IPIs") a new
function "arch_irq_work_raise" was added without a prototype.

In commit d914d4d49745
("arm64: Implement panic_smp_self_stop()") a new
function "panic_smp_self_stop" was added without a prototype.

We get the following warnings on W=1:
arch/arm64/kernel/smp.c:842:6: warning: no previous prototype
for ‘arch_irq_work_raise’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
arch/arm64/kernel/smp.c:862:6: warning: no previous prototype
for ‘panic_smp_self_stop’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]

Fix the warnings by:
1. Adding the prototype for 'arch_irq_work_raise' in irq_work.h
2. Adding the prototype for 'panic_smp_self_stop' in smp.h
