ceph: fix error handling in ceph_atomic_open and ceph_lookup

Commit aa60cfc3f7ee broke the error handling in these functions such
that they don't handle non-ENOENT errors from ceph_mdsc_do_request
properly.

Move the checking of -ENOENT out of ceph_handle_snapdir and into the
callers, and if we get a different error, return it immediately.
