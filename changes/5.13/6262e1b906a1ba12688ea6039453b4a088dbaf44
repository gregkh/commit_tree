printk: Move EXPORT_SYMBOL() closer to vprintk definition

Commit 28e1745b9fa2 ("printk: rename vprintk_func to vprintk") while
improving readability by removing vprintk indirection, inadvertently
placed the EXPORT_SYMBOL() for the newly renamed function at the end
of the file.

For reader sanity, and as is convention move the EXPORT_SYMBOL()
declaration just after the end of the function.
