mmc: mmc_spi: Set up polling even if voltage-ranges is not present

When voltage-ranges property is not present the driver assumes that
it is 3.3v (3.2v..3.4v). But at the same time it disallows polling.

Fix that by dropping the comparison to 0 when no property is provided.

While at it, mark voltage-ranges property optional as it was initially.
