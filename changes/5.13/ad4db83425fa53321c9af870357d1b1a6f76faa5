MAINTAINERS: add regressions mailing list

Add the newly created regression mailing list finally created after it
already had been agreed on during the maintainers summit 2017 (see
https://lwn.net/Articles/738216/ ). The topic was recently discussed
again, where an idea to create a broader list for all issues was
discussed, but Linus preferred a more targeted list:
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAHk-=wgiYqqLzsb9-UpfH+=ktk7ra-2fOsdc_ZJ7WF47wS73CA@mail.gmail.com/

Hence, the creation for that list was asked for and granted:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212557

In the end it became regressions@lists.linux.dev instead of
linux-regressions@lists.linux.dev as 'Linux' would have been redundant
in the latter case.
