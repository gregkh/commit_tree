cfg80211: fix phy80211 symlink creation

When I moved around the code here, I neglected that we could still
call register_netdev() or similar without the wiphy mutex held,
which then calls cfg80211_register_wdev() - that's also done from
cfg80211_register_netdevice(), but the phy80211 symlink creation
was only there. Now, the symlink isn't needed for a *pure* wdev,
but a netdev not registered via cfg80211_register_wdev() should
still have the symlink, so move the creation to the right place.
