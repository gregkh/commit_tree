net: really orphan skbs tied to closing sk

If the owing socket is shutting down - e.g. the sock reference
count already dropped to 0 and only sk_wmem_alloc is keeping
the sock alive, skb_orphan_partial() becomes a no-op.

When forwarding packets over veth with GRO enabled, the above
causes refcount errors.

This change addresses the issue with a plain skb_orphan() call
in the critical scenario.
