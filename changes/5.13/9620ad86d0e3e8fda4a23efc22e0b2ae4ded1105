afs: Re-enable freezing once a page fault is interrupted

If a task is killed during a page fault, it does not currently call
sb_end_pagefault(), which means that the filesystem cannot be frozen
at any time thereafter.  This may be reported by lockdep like this:

====================================
WARNING: fsstress/10757 still has locks held!
5.13.0-rc4-build4+ #91 Not tainted
------------------------------------
1 lock held by fsstress/10757:
 #0: ffff888104eac530
 (
sb_pagefaults

as filesystem freezing is modelled as a lock.

Fix this by removing all the direct returns from within the function,
and using 'ret' to indicate whether we were interrupted or successful.
