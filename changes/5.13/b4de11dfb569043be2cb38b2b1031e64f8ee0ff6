scsi: aic7xxx: Remove multiple definition of globals

Building aicasm with gcc 10.2 + gas 26.1 causes these errors:

  multiple definition of `args';
  multiple definition of `yylineno';

args came from the expansion of:

  STAILQ_HEAD(macro_arg_list, macro_arg) args;

The definition of the macro_arg_list structure is needed, the global
variable 'args' is not, so delete it.

yylineno is defined by flex, so defining it in bison/*.y file is not
needed. Also delete this.
