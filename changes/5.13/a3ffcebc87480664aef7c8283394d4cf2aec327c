ALSA: usb-audio: Remove redundant assignment to len

Variable len is set to zero but this value is never read as it is
overwritten with a new value later on, hence it is a redundant
assignment and can be removed.

Cleans up the following clang-analyzer warning:

sound/usb/mixer.c:2713:3: warning: Value stored to 'len' is never read
[clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores].
