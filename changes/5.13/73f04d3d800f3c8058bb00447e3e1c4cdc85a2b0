crypto: amcc - fix incorrect kernel-doc comment syntax in files

The opening comment mark '/**' is used for highlighting the beginning of
kernel-doc comments.
There are certain files in drivers/crypto/amcc, which follow this syntax,
but the content inside does not comply with kernel-doc.
Such lines were probably not meant for kernel-doc parsing, but are parsed
due to the presence of kernel-doc like comment syntax(i.e, '/**'), which
causes unexpected warnings from kernel-doc.

E.g., presence of kernel-doc like comment in
drivers/crypto/amcc/crypto4xx_alg.c at header, and some other lines,
causes these warnings by kernel-doc:

"warning: expecting prototype for AMCC SoC PPC4xx Crypto Driver(). Prototype was for set_dynamic_sa_command_0() instead"
"warning: Function parameter or member 'dir' not described in 'set_dynamic_sa_command_0'"
etc..

Provide a simple fix by replacing such occurrences with general comment
format, i.e. '/*', to prevent kernel-doc from parsing it.
