KVM: selftests: allow using UFFD minor faults for demand paging

UFFD handling of MINOR faults is a new feature whose use case is to
speed up demand paging (compared to MISSING faults). So, it's
interesting to let this selftest exercise this new mode.

Modify the demand paging test to have the option of using UFFD minor
faults, as opposed to missing faults. Now, when turning on userfaultfd
with '-u', the desired mode has to be specified ("MISSING" or "MINOR").

If we're in minor mode, before registering, prefault via the *alias*.
This way, the guest will trigger minor faults, instead of missing
faults, and we can UFFDIO_CONTINUE to resolve them.

Modify the page fault handler function to use the right ioctl depending
on the mode we're running in. In MINOR mode, use UFFDIO_CONTINUE.
