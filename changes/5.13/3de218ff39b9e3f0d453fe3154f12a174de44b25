xen/events: reset active flag for lateeoi events later

In order to avoid a race condition for user events when changing
cpu affinity reset the active flag only when EOI-ing the event.

This is working fine as all user events are lateeoi events. Note that
lateeoi_ack_mask_dynirq() is not modified as there is no explicit call
to xen_irq_lateeoi() expected later.
