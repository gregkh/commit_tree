mm: page_vma_mapped_walk(): use page for pvmw->page

Patch series "mm: page_vma_mapped_walk() cleanup and THP fixes".

I've marked all of these for stable: many are merely cleanups, but I
think they are much better before the main fix than after.

This patch (of 11):

page_vma_mapped_walk() cleanup: sometimes the local copy of pvwm->page
was used, sometimes pvmw->page itself: use the local copy "page"
throughout.
