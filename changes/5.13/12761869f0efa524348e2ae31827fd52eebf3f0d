serial: stm32: fix wake-up flag handling

This patch fixes several issue with wake-up handling:
- the WUF irq is handled several times at wake-up
- the USART is disabled / enabled at suspend to set wake-up flag.
It can cause glitches during RX.

This patch fix those issues:
- clear wake-up flag and disable wake-up irq in WUF irq handling
- enable wake-up from low power on start bit detection at port
configuration
- Unmask the wake-up flag irq at suspend and mask it at resume

In addition, pm_wakeup_event handling is moved from receice_chars to WUF
irq handling.
