HID: core: Remove extraneous empty line before EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(hid_check_keys_pressed)

Normally the EXPORT_SYMBOL of a function immediately follows the
declaration of the function and all the other functions in hid-core.c
follow this pattern, drop the extraneous empty line before the
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(hid_check_keys_pressed); line.
