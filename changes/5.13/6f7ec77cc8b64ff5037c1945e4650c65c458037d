USB: serial: cp210x: fix alternate function for CP2102N QFN20

The QFN20 part has a different GPIO/port function assignment. The
configuration struct bit field ordered as TX/RX/RS485/WAKEUP/CLK
which exactly matches GPIO0-3 for QFN24/28. However, QFN20 has a
different GPIO to primary function assignment.

Special case QFN20 to follow to properly detect which GPIOs are
available.
