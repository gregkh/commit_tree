MIPS/bpf: Enable bpf_probe_read{, str}() on MIPS again

After commit 0ebeea8ca8a4 ("bpf: Restrict bpf_probe_read{, str}() only to
archs where they work"), bpf_probe_read{, str}() functions were no longer
available on MIPS, so there exist some errors when running bpf program:

root@linux:/home/loongson/bcc# python examples/tracing/task_switch.py
bpf: Failed to load program: Invalid argument
[...]
11: (85) call bpf_probe_read#4
unknown func bpf_probe_read#4
[...]
Exception: Failed to load BPF program count_sched: Invalid argument

ARCH_HAS_NON_OVERLAPPING_ADDRESS_SPACE should be restricted to archs
with non-overlapping address ranges, but they can overlap in EVA mode
on MIPS, so select ARCH_HAS_NON_OVERLAPPING_ADDRESS_SPACE if !EVA in
arch/mips/Kconfig, otherwise the bpf old helper bpf_probe_read() will
not be available.

This is similar with the commit d195b1d1d119 ("powerpc/bpf: Enable
bpf_probe_read{, str}() on powerpc again").
