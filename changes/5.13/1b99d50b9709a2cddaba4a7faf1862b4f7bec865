ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Compile when any configuration is selected

Skylake is dependent on SND_SOC_INTEL_SKYLAKE (aka "all SST platforms")
whereas selecting specific configuration such as KBL-only will not
cause driver code to compile. Switch to SND_SOC_INTEL_SKYLAKE_COMMON
dependency so selecting any configuration causes the driver to be built.
