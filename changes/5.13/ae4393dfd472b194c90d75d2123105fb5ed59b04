i40e: fix broken XDP support

Commit 12738ac4754e ("i40e: Fix sparse errors in i40e_txrx.c") broke
XDP support in the i40e driver. That commit was fixing a sparse error
in the code by introducing a new variable xdp_res instead of
overloading this into the skb pointer. The problem is that the code
later uses the skb pointer in if statements and these where not
extended to also test for the new xdp_res variable. Fix this by adding
the correct tests for xdp_res in these places.

The skb pointer was used to store the result of the XDP program by
overloading the results in the error pointer
ERR_PTR(-result). Therefore, the allocation failure test that used to
only test for !skb now need to be extended to also consider !xdp_res.

i40e_cleanup_headers() had a check that based on the skb value being
an error pointer, i.e. a result from the XDP program != XDP_PASS, and
if so start to process a new packet immediately, instead of populating
skb fields and sending the skb to the stack. This check is not needed
anymore, since we have added an explicit test for xdp_res being set
and if so just do continue to pick the next packet from the NIC.
