docs: networking: device_drivers: fix bad usage of UTF-8 chars

Probably because the original file was pre-processed by some
tool, both i40e.rst and iavf.rst files are using this character:

	- U+2013 ('â€“'): EN DASH

meaning an hyphen when calling a command line application, which
is obviously wrong. So, replace them by an hyphen, ensuring
that it will be properly displayed as literals when building
the documentation.
