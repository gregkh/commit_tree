platform/surface: Add platform profile driver

Add a driver to provide platform profile support on 5th- and later
generation Microsoft Surface devices with a Surface System Aggregator
Module. On those devices, the platform profile can be used to influence
cooling behavior and power consumption.

For example, the default 'quiet' profile limits fan noise and in turn
sacrifices performance of the discrete GPU found on Surface Books. Its
full performance can only be unlocked on the 'performance' profile.
