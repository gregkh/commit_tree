ice: Allow all LLDP packets from PF to Tx

Currently in the ice driver, the check whether to
allow a LLDP packet to egress the interface from the
PF_VSI is being based on the SKB's priority field.
It checks to see if the packets priority is equal to
TC_PRIO_CONTROL.  Injected LLDP packets do not always
meet this condition.

SCAPY defaults to a sk_buff->protocol value of ETH_P_ALL
(0x0003) and does not set the priority field.  There will
be other injection methods (even ones used by end users)
that will not correctly configure the socket so that
SKB fields are correctly populated.

Then ethernet header has to have to correct value for
the protocol though.

Add a check to also allow packets whose ethhdr->h_proto
matches ETH_P_LLDP (0x88CC).
