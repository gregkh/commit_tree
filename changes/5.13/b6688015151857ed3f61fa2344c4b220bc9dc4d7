regulator: qcom_spmi-regulator: Clean-up by using managed work init

Few drivers implement remove call-back only for ensuring a delayed
work gets cancelled prior driver removal. Clean-up these by switching
to use devm_delayed_work_autocancel() instead.

Additionally, this helps avoiding mixing devm and manual resource
management and cleans up a (theoretical?) bug where devm managed
over-current IRQ might schedule a new work item after wq was cleaned
at remove().

This change is compile-tested only. All testing is appreciated.
