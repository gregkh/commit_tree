riscv: xip: support runtime trap patching

RISCV_ERRATA_ALTERNATIVE patches text at runtime which is currently
not possible when the kernel is executed from the flash in XIP mode.
Since runtime patching concerns only traps at the moment, let's just
have all the traps reside in RAM anyway if RISCV_ERRATA_ALTERNATIVE
is set. Thus, these functions will be patch-able even when the .text
section is in flash.
