RDMA/mlx5: Block FDB rules when not in switchdev mode

Allow creating FDB steering rules only when in switchdev mode.

The only software model where a userspace application can manipulate
FDB entries is when it manages the eswitch. This is only possible in
switchdev mode where we expose a single RDMA device with representors
for all the vports that are connected to the eswitch.
