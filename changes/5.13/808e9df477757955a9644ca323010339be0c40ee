userfaultfd: uapi: fix UFFDIO_CONTINUE ioctl request definition

This ioctl request reads from uffdio_continue structure written by
userspace which justifies _IOC_WRITE flag.  It also writes back to that
structure which justifies _IOC_READ flag.

See NOTEs in include/uapi/asm-generic/ioctl.h for more information.
