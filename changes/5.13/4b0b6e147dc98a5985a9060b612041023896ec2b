media: venus: hfi: Add 6xx AXI halt logic

This patch takes the downstream AXI halt routine and applies it when
IS_V6() is true.

bod: Converted to readl_poll_timeout()
     Removed poll timeout for LPI register, testing showed the value
     would always timeout and work, so the polling did nothing of value.
