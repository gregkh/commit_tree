mailmap: add Marek's other e-mail address and identity without diacritics

Some of my commits were sent with identities
  Marek Behun <marek.behun@nic.cz>
  Marek Behún <marek.behun@nic.cz>
while the correct one is
  Marek Behún <kabel@kernel.org>

Put this into mailmap so that git shortlog prints all my commits under
one identity.
