dmaengine: xilinx: dpdma: Limit descriptor IDs to 16 bits

While the descriptor ID is stored in a 32-bit field in the hardware
descriptor, only 16 bits are used by the hardware and are reported
through the XILINX_DPDMA_CH_DESC_ID register. Failure to handle the
wrap-around results in a descriptor ID mismatch after 65536 frames. Fix
it.
