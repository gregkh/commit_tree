NFS: Fix an Oopsable condition in __nfs_pageio_add_request()

Ensure that nfs_pageio_error_cleanup() resets the mirror array contents,
so that the structure reflects the fact that it is now empty.
Also change the test in nfs_pageio_do_add_request() to be more robust by
checking whether or not the list is empty rather than relying on the
value of pg_count.
