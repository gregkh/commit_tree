PCI: Mark some NVIDIA GPUs to avoid bus reset

Some NVIDIA GPU devices do not work with SBR.  Triggering SBR leaves the
device inoperable for the current system boot. It requires a system
hard-reboot to get the GPU device back to normal operating condition
post-SBR. For the affected devices, enable NO_BUS_RESET quirk to avoid the
issue.

This issue will be fixed in the next generation of hardware.
