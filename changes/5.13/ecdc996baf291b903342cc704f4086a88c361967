power: supply: axp20x_usb_power: fix work-queue init

The commit 6d0c5de2fd84
("power: supply: Clean-up few drivers by using managed work init")
Re-introduced wrong order of initializing work-queue and requesting
the IRQs which was originally fixed by the commit b5e8642ed95f
("power: supply: axp20x_usb_power: Init work before enabling IRQs")

In addition this caused the work queue to be initialized twice.

Fix it again.
