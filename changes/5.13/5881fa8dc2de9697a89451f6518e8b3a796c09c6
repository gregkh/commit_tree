debugfs: fix security_locked_down() call for SELinux

When (ia->ia_valid & (ATTR_MODE | ATTR_UID | ATTR_GID)) is zero, then
the SELinux implementation of the locked_down hook might report a denial
even though the operation would actually be allowed.

To fix this, make sure that security_locked_down() is called only when
the return value will be taken into account (i.e. when changing one of
the problematic attributes).

Note: this was introduced by commit 5496197f9b08 ("debugfs: Restrict
debugfs when the kernel is locked down"), but it didn't matter at that
time, as the SELinux support came in later.
