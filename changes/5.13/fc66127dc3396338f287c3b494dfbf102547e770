s390: fix system call restart with multiple signals

glibc complained with "The futex facility returned an unexpected error
code.". It turned out that the futex syscall returned -ERESTARTSYS because
a signal is pending. arch_do_signal_or_restart() restored the syscall
parameters (nameley regs->gprs[2]) and set PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART. When
another signal is made pending later in the exit loop
arch_do_signal_or_restart() is called again. This function clears
PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART and checks the return code which is set in
regs->gprs[2]. However, regs->gprs[2] was restored in the previous run
and no longer contains -ERESTARTSYS, so PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART isn't set
again and the syscall is skipped.

Fix this by not clearing PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART - it is already cleared in
__do_syscall() when the syscall is restarted.
