proc: only require mm_struct for writing

Commit 591a22c14d3f ("proc: Track /proc/$pid/attr/ opener mm_struct") we
started using __mem_open() to track the mm_struct at open-time, so that
we could then check it for writes.

But that also ended up making the permission checks at open time much
stricter - and not just for writes, but for reads too.  And that in turn
caused a regression for at least Fedora 29, where NIC interfaces fail to
start when using NetworkManager.

Since only the write side wanted the mm_struct test, ignore any failures
by __mem_open() at open time, leaving reads unaffected.  The write()
time verification of the mm_struct pointer will then catch the failure
case because a NULL pointer will not match a valid 'current->mm'.
