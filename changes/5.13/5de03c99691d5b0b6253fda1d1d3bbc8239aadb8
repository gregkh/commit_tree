USB: serial: add support for multi-interface functions

A single USB function can be implemented using a group of interfaces and
this is for example commonly used for Communication Class devices.

Add support for multi-interface functions to USB serial core and export
an interface that allows drivers to claim a second sibling interface.
The interface could easily be extended to allow claiming further
interfaces if ever needed.

When a driver claims a sibling interface in probe(), core allocates
resources for any bulk in, bulk out, interrupt in and interrupt out
endpoints found also on the sibling interface.

Disconnect is implemented so that unbinding either interface will
release the other interface while disconnect() is called precisely once.

Similarly, suspend() is called when the first sibling interface is
suspended and resume() is called when the last sibling interface is
resumed by USB core.
