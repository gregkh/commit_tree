net: phy: dp83867: perform soft reset and retain established link

Current logic is performing hard reset and causing the programmed
registers to be wiped out.

as per datasheet: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/dp83867cr.pdf
8.6.26 Control Register (CTRL)

do SW_RESTART to perform a reset not including the registers,
If performed when link is already present,
it will drop the link and trigger re-auto negotiation.
