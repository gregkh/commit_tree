s390/mcck: fix invalid KVM guest condition check

Wrong condition check is used to decide if a machine check hit
while in KVM guest. As result of this check the instruction
following the SIE critical section might be considered as still
in KVM guest and _CIF_MCCK_GUEST CPU flag mistakenly set as
result.
