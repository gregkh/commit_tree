perf test: Fix libpfm4 support (63) test error for nested event groups

Compiling perf with make LIBPFM4=1 includes libpfm support and
enables test case 63 'Test libpfm4 support'. This test reports an error
on all platforms for subtest 63.2 'test groups of --pfm-events'.
The reported error message is 'nested event groups not supported'

 # ./perf test -F 63

This patch addresses the error message 'nested event groups not supported'.
The root cause is function parse_libpfm_events_option() which parses the
event string '{},{instructions}' and can not handle a leading empty
group notation '{},...'.

The code detects the first (empty) group indicator '{' but does not
terminate group processing on the following group closing character '}'.
So when the second group indicator '{' is detected, the code assumes
a nested group and returns an error.

With the error message fixed, also change the expected event number to
one for the test case to succeed.

While at it also fix a memory leak. In good case the function does not
free the duplicated string given as first parameter.

Output after:
 # ./perf test -F 63
