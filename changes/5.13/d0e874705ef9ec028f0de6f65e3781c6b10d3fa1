misc: sgi-xp: xp_main: make some symbols static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xp_main.c:24:22: warning:
 symbol 'xp_dbg_name' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xp_main.c:28:15: warning:
 symbol 'xp_dbg_subname' was not declared. Should it be static?

These symbols are not used outside of xp_main.c, so this
commit marks them static.
