mt76: mt7921: remove redundant check on type

Currently in the switch statement case where type is
NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION there is a check to see if type
is not NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION.  This check is always false
and is redundant dead code that can be removed.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Logically dead code")
