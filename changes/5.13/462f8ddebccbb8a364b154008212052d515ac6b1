KVM: x86: Fix implicit enum conversion goof in scattered reverse CPUID code

Take "enum kvm_only_cpuid_leafs" in scattered specific CPUID helpers
(which is obvious in hindsight), and use "unsigned int" for leafs that
can be the kernel's standard "enum cpuid_leaf" or the aforementioned
KVM-only variant.  Loss of the enum params is a bit disapponting, but
gcc obviously isn't providing any extra sanity checks, and the various
BUILD_BUG_ON() assertions ensure the input is in range.

This fixes implicit enum conversions that are detected by clang-11:

arch/x86/kvm/cpuid.c:499:29: warning: implicit conversion from enumeration type 'enum kvm_only_cpuid_leafs' to different enumeration type 'enum cpuid_leafs' [-Wenum-conversion]
