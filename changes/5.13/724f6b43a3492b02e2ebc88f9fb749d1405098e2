scsi: lpfc: Fix use-after-free on unused nodes after port swap

During target port swap, the swap logic ignores the DROPPED flag in the
nodes. As a node then moves into the UNUSED state, the reference count will
be dropped. If a node is later reused and moved out of the UNUSED state, an
access can result in a use-after-free assert.

Fix by having the port swap logic propagate the DROPPED flag when switching
nodes. This will avoid reference from being dropped.
