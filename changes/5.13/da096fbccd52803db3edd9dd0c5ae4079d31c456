soundwire: qcom: fix handling of qcom,ports-block-pack-mode

Support to "qcom,ports-block-pack-mode" was added at later stages
to support a variant of Qualcomm SoundWire controllers available
on Apps processor. However the older versions of the SoundWire
controller which are embedded in WCD Codecs do not need this property.

So returning on error for those cases will break boards like DragonBoard
DB845c and Lenovo Yoga C630.

This patch fixes error handling on this property considering older usecases.
