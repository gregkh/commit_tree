Revert "ACPI: sleep: Put the FACS table after using it"

Commit 95722237cb2a ("ACPI: sleep: Put the FACS table after using it")
puts the FACS table during initialization.

But the hardware signature bits in the FACS table need to be accessed,
after every hibernation, to compare with the original hardware
signature.

So there is no reason to release the FACS table mapping after
initialization.

This reverts commit 95722237cb2ae4f7b73471058cdb19e8f4057c93.

An alternative solution is to use acpi_gbl_FACS variable instead, which
is mapped by the ACPICA core and never released.
