coresight: core: Add support for dedicated percpu sinks

Add support for dedicated sinks that are bound to individual CPUs. (e.g,
TRBE). To allow quicker access to the sink for a given CPU bound source,
keep a percpu array of the sink devices. Also, add support for building
a path to the CPU local sink from the ETM.

This adds a new percpu sink type CORESIGHT_DEV_SUBTYPE_SINK_PERCPU_SYSMEM.
This new sink type is exclusively available and can only work with percpu
source type device CORESIGHT_DEV_SUBTYPE_SOURCE_PROC.

This defines a percpu structure that accommodates a single coresight_device
which can be used to store an initialized instance from a sink driver. As
these sinks are exclusively linked and dependent on corresponding percpu
sources devices, they should also be the default sink device during a perf
session.

Outwards device connections are scanned while establishing paths between a
source and a sink device. But such connections are not present for certain
percpu source and sink devices which are exclusively linked and dependent.
Build the path directly and skip connection scanning for such devices.
