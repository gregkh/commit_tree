powerpc: Fix reverse map real-mode address lookup with huge vmalloc

real_vmalloc_addr() does not currently work for huge vmalloc, which is
what the reverse map can be allocated with for radix host, hash guest.

Extract the hugepage aware equivalent from eeh code into a helper, and
convert existing sites including this one to use it.
