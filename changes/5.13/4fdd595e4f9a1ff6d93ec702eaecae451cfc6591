tracing: Do not stop recording comms if the trace file is being read

A while ago, when the "trace" file was opened, tracing was stopped, and
code was added to stop recording the comms to saved_cmdlines, for mapping
of the pids to the task name.

Code has been added that only records the comm if a trace event occurred,
and there's no reason to not trace it if the trace file is opened.
