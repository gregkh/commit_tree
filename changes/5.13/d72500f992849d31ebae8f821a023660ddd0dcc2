powerpc/64s/syscall: Fix ptrace syscall info with scv syscalls

The scv implementation missed updating syscall return value and error
value get/set functions to deal with the changed register ABI. This
broke ptrace PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO as well as some kernel auditing
and tracing functions.

Fix. tools/testing/selftests/ptrace/get_syscall_info now passes when
scv is used.
