cgroup: disable controllers at parse time

This patch effectively reverts the commit a3e72739b7a7 ("cgroup: fix
too early usage of static_branch_disable()"). The commit 6041186a3258
("init: initialize jump labels before command line option parsing") has
moved the jump_label_init() before parse_args() which has made the
commit a3e72739b7a7 unnecessary. On the other hand there are
consequences of disabling the controllers later as there are subsystems
doing the controller checks for different decisions. One such incident
is reported [1] regarding the memory controller and its impact on memory
reclaim code.
