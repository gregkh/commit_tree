x86/fpu: Preserve supervisor states in sanitize_restored_user_xstate()

sanitize_restored_user_xstate() preserves the supervisor states only
when the fx_only argument is zero, which allows unprivileged user space
to put supervisor states back into init state.

Preserve them unconditionally.

 [ bp: Fix a typo or two in the text. ]
