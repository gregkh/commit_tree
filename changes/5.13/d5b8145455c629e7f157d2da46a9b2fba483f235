Revert "gfs2: Fix mmap locking for write faults"

This reverts commit b7f55d928e75557295c1ac280c291b738905b6fb.

As explained by Linus in [*], write faults on a mmap region are reads
from a filesysten point of view, so taking the inode glock exclusively
on write faults is incorrect.

Instead, when a page is marked writable, the .page_mkwrite vm operation
will be called, which is where the exclusive lock taking needs to
happen.  I got this wrong because of a broken test case that made me
believe .page_mkwrite isn't getting called when it actually is.
