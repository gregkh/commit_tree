xprtrdma: Fix a NULL dereference in frwr_unmap_sync()

The normal mechanism that invalidates and unmaps MRs is
frwr_unmap_async(). frwr_unmap_sync() is used only when an RPC
Reply bearing Write or Reply chunks has been lost (ie, almost
never).

Coverity found that after commit 9a301cafc861 ("xprtrdma: Move
fr_linv_done field to struct rpcrdma_mr"), the while() loop in
frwr_unmap_sync() exits only once @mr is NULL, unconditionally
causing subsequent dereferences of @mr to Oops.

I've tested this fix by creating a client that skips invoking
frwr_unmap_async() when RPC Replies complete. That forces all
invalidation tasks to fall upon frwr_unmap_sync(). Simple workloads
with this fix applied to the adulterated client work as designed.
