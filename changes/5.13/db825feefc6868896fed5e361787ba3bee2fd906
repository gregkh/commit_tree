net/mlx4: Fix EEPROM dump support

Fix SFP and QSFP* EEPROM queries by setting i2c_address, offset and page
number correctly. For SFP set the following params:
- I2C address for offsets 0-255 is 0x50. For 256-511 - 0x51.
- Page number is zero.
- Offset is 0-255.

At the same time, QSFP* parameters are different:
- I2C address is always 0x50.
- Page number is not limited to zero.
- Offset is 0-255 for page zero and 128-255 for others.

To set parameters accordingly to cable used, implement function to query
module ID and implement respective helper functions to set parameters
correctly.
