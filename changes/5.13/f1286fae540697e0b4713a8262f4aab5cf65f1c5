mm: memcontrol: inline __memcg_kmem_{un}charge() into obj_cgroup_{un}charge_pages()

There is only one user of __memcg_kmem_charge(), so manually inline
__memcg_kmem_charge() to obj_cgroup_charge_pages().  Similarly manually
inline __memcg_kmem_uncharge() into obj_cgroup_uncharge_pages() and call
obj_cgroup_uncharge_pages() in obj_cgroup_release().

This is just code cleanup without any functionality changes.
