gdb: lx-symbols: store the abspath()

If we store the relative path, the user might later cd to a different
directory, and that would break the automatic symbol resolving that
happens when a module is loaded into the target kernel.  Fix this by
storing the abspath() of each path given, just like we already do for the
cwd (os.getcwd() is absolute.)
