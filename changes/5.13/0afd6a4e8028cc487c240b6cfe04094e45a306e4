bnxt_en: Rediscover PHY capabilities after firmware reset

There is a missing bnxt_probe_phy() call in bnxt_fw_init_one() to
rediscover the PHY capabilities after a firmware reset.  This can cause
some PHY related functionalities to fail after a firmware reset.  For
example, in multi-host, the ability for any host to configure the PHY
settings may be lost after a firmware reset.
