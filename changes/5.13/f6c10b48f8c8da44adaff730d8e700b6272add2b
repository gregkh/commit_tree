i40e: add correct exception tracing for XDP

Add missing exception tracing to XDP when a number of different errors
can occur. The support was only partial. Several errors where not
logged which would confuse the user quite a lot not knowing where and
why the packets disappeared.

Fixes: 74608d17fe29 ("i40e: add support for XDP_TX action")
Fixes: 0a714186d3c0 ("i40e: add AF_XDP zero-copy Rx support")
