xhci: fix potential array out of bounds with several interrupters

The Max Interrupters supported by the controller is given in a 10bit
wide bitfield, but the driver uses a fixed 128 size array to index these
interrupters.

Klockwork reports a possible array out of bounds case which in theory
is possible. In practice this hasn't been hit as a common number of Max
Interrupters for new controllers is 8, not even close to 128.

This needs to be fixed anyway
