tools/x86/kcpuid: Check last token too

Input lines like

  0x8000001E,     0, EAX,   31:0, Extended APIC ID

where the short name is missing lead to a segfault because the loop
takes the long name for the short name and tokens[5] becomes NULL which
explodes later in strcpy().

Check its value too before further processing.
