ASoC: AMD Renoir: Remove fix for DMI entry on Lenovo 2020 platforms

Unfortunately the previous patch to fix issues using the AMD ACP bridge
has the side effect of breaking the dmic in other cases and needs to be
reverted.

Removing the changes while we revisit the fix and find something better.
Apologies for the churn.
