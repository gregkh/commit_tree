arm64: use function_nocfi with __pa_symbol

With CONFIG_CFI_CLANG, the compiler replaces function address
references with the address of the function's CFI jump table
entry. This means that __pa_symbol(function) returns the physical
address of the jump table entry, which can lead to address space
confusion as the jump table points to the function's virtual
address. Therefore, use the function_nocfi() macro to ensure we are
always taking the address of the actual function instead.
