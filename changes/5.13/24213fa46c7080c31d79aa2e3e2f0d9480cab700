btrfs: do proper error handling in merge_reloc_roots

We have a BUG_ON() if we get an error back from btrfs_get_fs_root().
This honestly should never fail, as at this point we have a solid
coordination of fs root to reloc root, and these roots will all be in
memory.  But in the name of killing BUG_ON()'s remove these and handle
the error condition properly, ASSERT()'ing for developers.
