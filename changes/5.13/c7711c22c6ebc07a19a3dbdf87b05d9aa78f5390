bus: mhi: pci_generic: T99W175: update channel name from AT to DUN

According to MHI v1.1 specification, change the channel name of T99W175
from "AT" to "DUN" (Dial-up networking) for both channel 32 and 33,
so that the channels can be bound to the Qcom WWAN control driver, and
device node such as /dev/wwan0p3DUN will be generated, which is very useful
for debugging modem
