drm/vc4: hdmi: Move the HSM clock enable to runtime_pm

In order to access the HDMI controller, we need to make sure the HSM
clock is enabled. If we were to access it with the clock disabled, the
CPU would completely hang, resulting in an hard crash.

Since we have different code path that would require it, let's move that
clock enable / disable to runtime_pm that will take care of the
reference counting for us.
