nvme: sanitize KATO setting

According to the NVMe base spec the KATO commands should be sent
at half of the KATO interval, to properly account for round-trip
times.
As we now will only ever send one KATO command per connection we
can easily use the recommended values.
This also fixes a potential issue where the request timeout for
the KATO command does not match the value in the connect command,
which might be causing spurious connection drops from the target.
