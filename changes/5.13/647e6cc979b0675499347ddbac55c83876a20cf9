platform/surface: aggregator: Do not mark interrupt as shared

Having both IRQF_NO_AUTOEN and IRQF_SHARED set causes
request_threaded_irq() to return with -EINVAL (see comment in flag
validation in that function). As the interrupt is currently not shared
between multiple devices, drop the IRQF_SHARED flag.

Fixes: 507cf5a2f1e2 ("platform/surface: aggregator: move to use request_irq by IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag")
