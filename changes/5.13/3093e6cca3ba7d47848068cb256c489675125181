gpio: mxc: Fix disabled interrupt wake-up support

A disabled/masked interrupt marked as wakeup source must be re-enable
and unmasked in order to be able to wake-up the host. That can be done
by flaging the irqchip with IRQCHIP_ENABLE_WAKEUP_ON_SUSPEND.

Note: It 'sometimes' works without that change, but only thanks to the
lazy generic interrupt disabling (keeping interrupt unmasked).
