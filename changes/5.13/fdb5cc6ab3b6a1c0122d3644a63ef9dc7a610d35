net: phy: lan87xx: fix access to wrong register of LAN87xx

The function lan87xx_config_aneg_ext was introduced to configure
LAN95xxA but as well writes to undocumented register of LAN87xx.
This fix prevents that access.

The function lan87xx_config_aneg_ext gets more suitable for the new
behavior name.
