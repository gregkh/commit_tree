usb: gadget: uvc: add bInterval checking for HS mode

Patch adds extra checking for bInterval passed by configfs.
The 5.6.4 chapter of USB Specification (rev. 2.0) say:
"A high-bandwidth endpoint must specify a period of 1x125 Âµs
(i.e., a bInterval value of 1)."

The issue was observed during testing UVC class on CV.
I treat this change as improvement because we can control
bInterval by configfs.
