Fix kernel oops when CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP is enabled.

Removed oplock_break_received flag which was added to achieve
synchronization between oplock handler and open handler by earlier commit.

It is not needed because there is an existing lock open_file_lock to achieve
the same. find_readable_file takes open_file_lock and then traverses the
openFileList. Similarly, cifs_oplock_break while closing the deferred
handle (i.e cifsFileInfo_put) takes open_file_lock and then sends close
to the server.

Added comments for better readability.
