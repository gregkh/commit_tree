drm/i915: refactor ddi translations into a separate file (v2)

Ville suggested this, these tables are probably better being
standalone.

This fixes up the cnl/bxt interfaces to be like the others,
the intel one I left alone since it has a few extra entrypoints.

v2: add back missing rocketlake bits.
