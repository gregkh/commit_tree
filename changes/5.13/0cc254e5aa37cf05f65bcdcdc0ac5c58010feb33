net/sched: act_ct: Offload connections with commit action

Currently established connections are not offloaded if the filter has a
"ct commit" action. This behavior will not offload connections of the
following scenario:

$ tc_filter add dev $DEV ingress protocol ip prio 1 flower \
  ct_state -trk \
  action ct commit action goto chain 1

$ tc_filter add dev $DEV ingress protocol ip chain 1 prio 1 flower \
  action mirred egress redirect dev $DEV2

$ tc_filter add dev $DEV2 ingress protocol ip prio 1 flower \
  action ct commit action goto chain 1

$ tc_filter add dev $DEV2 ingress protocol ip prio 1 chain 1 flower \
  ct_state +trk+est \
  action mirred egress redirect dev $DEV

Offload established connections, regardless of the commit flag.
