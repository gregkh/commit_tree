kfence: use TASK_IDLE when awaiting allocation

Since wait_event() uses TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE by default, waiting for an
allocation counts towards load.  However, for KFENCE, this does not make
any sense, since there is no busy work we're awaiting.

Instead, use TASK_IDLE via wait_event_idle() to not count towards load.
