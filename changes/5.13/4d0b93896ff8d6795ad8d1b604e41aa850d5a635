bpf: Make symbol 'bpf_task_storage_busy' static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

kernel/bpf/bpf_task_storage.c:23:1: warning:
 symbol '__pcpu_scope_bpf_task_storage_busy' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of bpf_task_storage.c, so this
commit marks it static.

Fixes: bc235cdb423a ("bpf: Prevent deadlock from recursive bpf_task_storage_[get|delete]")
