dmaengine: dw-edma: Change linked list and data blocks offset and sizes

Changes the linked list and data blocks offset and sizes to follow the
recommendation given by the hardware team for the IPK solution.

Although the previous data blocks offset and sizes are still valid and
functional, using them that might present some issues related to the IPK
solution, since this solution is based on FPGA and might be subjected to
timmings constrains.
