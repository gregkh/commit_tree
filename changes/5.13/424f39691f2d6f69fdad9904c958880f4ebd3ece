pinctrl: Ingenic: Add pinctrl driver for JZ4730.

Add support for probing the pinctrl-ingenic driver on the
JZ4730 SoC from Ingenic.

This driver is derived from Paul Boddie. It is worth to
noting that the JZ4730 SoC is special in having two control
registers (upper/lower), so add code to handle the JZ4730
specific register offsets and some register pairs which have
2 bits for each GPIO pin.
