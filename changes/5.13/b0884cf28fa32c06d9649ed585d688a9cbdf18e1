ARM: dts: imx6q-ba16: improve PHY information

Add PHY voltage supply information fixing the following kernel message:

2188000.ethernet supply phy not found, using dummy regulator

Also add PHY clock information to avoid depending on the bootloader
programming correct values.

The bootloader also sets some reserved registers in the PHY as
advised by Qualcomm, which is not supported by the bindings/kernel
driver, so the reset GPIO has not been added intentionally.
