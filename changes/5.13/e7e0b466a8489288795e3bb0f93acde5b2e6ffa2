hwmon: (sch5627) Convert to hwmon_device_register_with_info()

hwmon_device_register() is deprecated.
Convert driver to use hwmon_device_register_with_info() and
remove sysfs attributes which are now being handled by the
hwmon subsystem.

Channel handling was inspired by corsair-cpro.

Tested on a Fujitsu Esprimo P720.
