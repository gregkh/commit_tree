i2c: robotfuzz-osif: fix control-request directions

The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
implementation.

Control transfers without a data stage are treated as OUT requests by
the USB stack and should be using usb_sndctrlpipe(). Failing to do so
will now trigger a warning.

Fix the OSIFI2C_SET_BIT_RATE and OSIFI2C_STOP requests which erroneously
used the osif_usb_read() helper and set the IN direction bit.
