mm/hugetlb: remove redundant reservation check condition in alloc_huge_page()

vma_resv_map(vma) checks if a reserve map is associated with the vma.
The routine vma_needs_reservation() will check vma_resv_map(vma) and
return 1 if no reserv map is present.  map_chg is set to the return
value of vma_needs_reservation().  Therefore, !vma_resv_map(vma) is
redundant in the expression:

	map_chg || avoid_reserve || !vma_resv_map(vma);

Remove the redundant check.
