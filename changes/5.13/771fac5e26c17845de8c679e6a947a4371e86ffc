Revert "cpufreq: CPPC: Add support for frequency invariance"

This reverts commit 4c38f2df71c8e33c0b64865992d693f5022eeaad.

There are few races in the frequency invariance support for CPPC driver,
namely the driver doesn't stop the kthread_work and irq_work on policy
exit during suspend/resume or CPU hotplug.

A proper fix won't be possible for the 5.13-rc, as it requires a lot of
changes. Lets revert the patch instead for now.
