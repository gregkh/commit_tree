platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Stop reporting SW_DOCK events

Stop reporting SW_DOCK events because this breaks suspend-on-lid-close.

SW_DOCK should only be reported for docking stations, but all the DSDTs in
my DSDT collection which use the intel-vbtn code, always seem to use this
for 2-in-1s / convertibles and set SW_DOCK=1 when in laptop-mode (in tandem
with setting SW_TABLET_MODE=0).

This causes userspace to think the laptop is docked to a port-replicator
and to disable suspend-on-lid-close, which is undesirable.

Map the dock events to KEY_IGNORE to avoid this broken SW_DOCK reporting.

Note this may theoretically cause us to stop reporting SW_DOCK on some
device where the 0xCA and 0xCB intel-vbtn events are actually used for
reporting docking to a classic docking-station / port-replicator but
I'm not aware of any such devices.

Also the most important thing is that we only report SW_DOCK when it
reliably reports being docked to a classic docking-station without any
false positives, which clearly is not the case here. If there is a
chance of reporting false positives then it is better to not report
SW_DOCK at all.
