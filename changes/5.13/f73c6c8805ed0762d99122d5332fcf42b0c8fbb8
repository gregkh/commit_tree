include/linux/page-flags-layout.h: correctly determine LAST_CPUPID_WIDTH

The naming convention used in include/linux/page-flags-layout.h:
  *_SHIFT: the number of bits trying to allocate
  *_WIDTH: the number of bits successfully allocated

So when it comes to LAST_CPUPID_WIDTH, we need to check whether all
previous *_WIDTH and LAST_CPUPID_SHIFT can fit into page flags. This
means we need to use NODES_WIDTH, not NODES_SHIFT.
