HID: asus: Cleanup Asus T101HA keyboard-dock handling

There is no need to use a quirk and then return -ENODEV from the
asus_probe() function to avoid that hid-asus binds to the hiddev
for the USB-interface for the hid-multitouch touchpad.

The hid-multitouch hiddev has a group of HID_GROUP_MULTITOUCH_WIN_8,
so the same result can be achieved by making the hid_device_id entry
for the dock in the asus_devices[] table only match on HID_GROUP_GENERIC
instead of having it match HID_GROUP_ANY.
