alarmtimer: Check RTC features instead of ops

RTC drivers used to leave .set_alarm() NULL in order to signal the RTC
device doesn't support alarms. The drivers are now clearing the
RTC_FEATURE_ALARM bit for that purpose in order to keep the rtc_class_ops
structure const. So now, .set_alarm() is set unconditionally and this
possibly causes the alarmtimer code to select an RTC device that doesn't
support alarms.

Test RTC_FEATURE_ALARM instead of relying on ops->set_alarm to determine
whether alarms are available.
