KVM: x86/mmu: Bail from fast_page_fault() if SPTE is not shadow-present

Bail from fast_page_fault() if the SPTE is not a shadow-present SPTE.
Functionally, this is not strictly necessary as the !is_access_allowed()
check will eventually reject the fast path, but an early check on
shadow-present skips unnecessary checks and will allow a future patch to
tweak the A/D status auditing to warn if KVM attempts to query A/D bits
without first ensuring the SPTE is a shadow-present SPTE.

Note, is_shadow_present_pte() is quite expensive at this time, i.e. this
might be a net negative in the short term.  A future patch will optimize
is_shadow_present_pte() to a single AND operation and remedy the issue.
