ASoC: SOF: core: Add missing error prints to device probe operation

Two error cases in snd_sof_device_probe() and sof_probe_continue() are
missing error prints.
If either of them happens it is not possible to identify the reason for the
failure.

Add dev_err() prints for the cases to aim debugging.
