drm/msm/dsi: stop passing src_pll_id to the phy_enable call

Phy driver already knows the source PLL id basing on the set usecase and
the current PLL id. Stop passing it to the phy_enable call. As a
reminder, dsi manager will always use DSI 0 as a clock master in a slave
mode, so PLL 0 is always a clocksource for DSI 0 and it is always a
clocksource for DSI 1 too unless DSI 1 is used in the standalone mode.
