arm64: dts: ti: k3-am65|j721e|am64: Map the dma / navigator subsystem via explicit ranges

Instead of using empty ranges property, lets map explicitly the address
range that is mapped onto the dma / navigator subsystems (navss/dmss).

This is also exposed via the dtbs_check with dt-schema newer than
2021.03 version by throwing out following:
arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am654-base-board.dt.yaml: bus@100000: main-navss:
{'type': 'object'} is not allowed for
{'compatible': ['simple-mfd'], '#address-cells': [[2]], .....

This has already been correctly done for J7200, however was missed for
other k3 SoCs. Fix that oversight.
