i2c: dev: Add __user annotation

Fix Sparse warnings:
drivers/i2c/i2c-dev.c:546:19: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
drivers/i2c/i2c-dev.c:549:53: warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces)

compat_ptr() returns a pointer tagged __user which gets assigned to a
pointer missing the __user annotation. The same pointer is passed to
copy_from_user() as an argument where it is expected to have the __user
annotation. Fix both by adding the __user annotation to the pointer.
