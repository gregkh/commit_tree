usb: dwc2: Clear fifo_map when resetting core.

Switching from device mode to host mode by disconnecting
device cable core enters and exits form hibernation.
However, the fifo map remains not cleared. It results
to a WARNING (WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 0 at drivers/usb/dwc2/
gadget.c:307 dwc2_hsotg_init_fifo+0x12/0x152 [dwc2])
if in host mode we disconnect the micro a to b host
cable. Because core reset occurs.

To avoid the WARNING, fifo_map should be cleared
in dwc2_core_reset() function by taking into account configs.
fifo_map must be cleared only if driver is configured in
"CONFIG_USB_DWC2_PERIPHERAL" or "CONFIG_USB_DWC2_DUAL_ROLE"
mode.

- Added "static inline void dwc2_clear_fifo_map()" helper
function to clear fifo_map with peripheral or dual role mode.

- Added a dummy version of "dwc2_clear_fifo_map()" helper
for host-only mode.
