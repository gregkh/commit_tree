gpiolib: cdev: zero padding during conversion to gpioline_info_changed

When userspace requests a GPIO v1 line info changed event,
lineinfo_watch_read() populates and returns the gpioline_info_changed
structure. It contains 5 words of padding at the end which are not
initialized before being returned to userspace.

Zero the structure in gpio_v2_line_info_change_to_v1() before populating
its contents.
