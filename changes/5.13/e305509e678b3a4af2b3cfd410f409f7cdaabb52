Bluetooth: use correct lock to prevent UAF of hdev object

The hci_sock_dev_event() function will cleanup the hdev object for
sockets even if this object may still be in used within the
hci_sock_bound_ioctl() function, result in UAF vulnerability.

This patch replace the BH context lock to serialize these affairs
and prevent the race condition.
