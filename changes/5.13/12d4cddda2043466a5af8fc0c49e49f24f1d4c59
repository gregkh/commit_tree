ktest: Fixing indentation to match expected pattern

This is a followup to "ktest: Adding editor hints to improve
consistency" to actually adjust the existing indentation to match
the, now, expected pattern (first column 4 spaces, 2nd tab, 3rd
tab + 4 spaces, etc).  This should, at least help, keep things
consistent going forward now.
