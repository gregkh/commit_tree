HID: lenovo: Map mic-mute button to KEY_F20 instead of KEY_MICMUTE

Mapping the mic-mute button to KEY_MICMUTE is technically correct but
KEY_MICMUTE translates to a scancode of 256 (248 + 8) under X,
which does not fit in 8 bits, so it does not work.

Because of this userspace is expecting KEY_F20 instead,
theoretically KEY_MICMUTE should work under Wayland but even
there it does not work, because the desktop-environment is
listening only for KEY_F20 and not for KEY_MICMUTE.
