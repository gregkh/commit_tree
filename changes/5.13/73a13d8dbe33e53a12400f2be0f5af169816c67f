net: hns3: fix user's coalesce configuration lost issue

Currently, when adaptive is on, the user's coalesce configuration
may be overwritten by the dynamic one. The reason is that user's
configurations are saved in struct hns3_enet_tqp_vector whose
value maybe changed by the dynamic algorithm. To fix it, use
struct hns3_nic_priv instead of struct hns3_enet_tqp_vector to
save and get the user's configuration.

BTW, operations of storing and restoring coalesce info in the reset
process are unnecessary now, so remove them as well.
