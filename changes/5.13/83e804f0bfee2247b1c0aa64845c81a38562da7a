fs,security: Add sb_delete hook

The sb_delete security hook is called when shutting down a superblock,
which may be useful to release kernel objects tied to the superblock's
lifetime (e.g. inodes).

This new hook is needed by Landlock to release (ephemerally) tagged
struct inodes.  This comes from the unprivileged nature of Landlock
described in the next commit.
