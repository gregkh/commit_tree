vfio: Remove extra put/gets around vfio_device->group

The vfio_device->group value has a get obtained during
vfio_add_group_dev() which gets moved from the stack to vfio_device->group
in vfio_group_create_device().

The reference remains until we reach the end of vfio_del_group_dev() when
it is put back.

Thus anything that already has a kref on the vfio_device is guaranteed a
valid group pointer. Remove all the extra reference traffic.

It is tricky to see, but the get at the start of vfio_del_group_dev() is
actually pairing with the put hidden inside vfio_device_put() a few lines
below.

A later patch merges vfio_group_create_device() into vfio_add_group_dev()
which makes the ownership and error flow on the create side easier to
follow.
