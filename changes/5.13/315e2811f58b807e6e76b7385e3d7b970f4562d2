USB: serial: iuu_phoenix: remove redundant variable 'error'

The variable error is initialized to 0 and is set to 1 this
value is never read as it is on an immediate return path. The
only read of error is to check it is 0 and this check is always
true at that point of the code. The variable is redundant and
can be removed.
