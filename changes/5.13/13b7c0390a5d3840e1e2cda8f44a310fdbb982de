video: imsttfb: check for ioremap() failures

We should check if ioremap() were to somehow fail in imsttfb_probe() and
handle the unwinding of the resources allocated here properly.

Ideally if anyone cares about this driver (it's for a PowerMac era PCI
display card), they wouldn't even be using fbdev anymore.  Or the devm_*
apis could be used, but that's just extra work for diminishing
returns...
