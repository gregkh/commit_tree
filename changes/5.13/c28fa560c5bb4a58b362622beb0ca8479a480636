KVM: x86/vPMU: Forbid reading from MSR_F15H_PERF MSRs when guest doesn't have X86_FEATURE_PERFCTR_CORE

MSR_F15H_PERF_CTL0-5, MSR_F15H_PERF_CTR0-5 MSRs have a CPUID bit assigned
to them (X86_FEATURE_PERFCTR_CORE) and when it wasn't exposed to the guest
the correct behavior is to inject #GP an not just return zero.
