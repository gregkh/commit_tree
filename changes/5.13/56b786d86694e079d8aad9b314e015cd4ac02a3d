net: usb: fix possible use-after-free in smsc75xx_bind

The commit 46a8b29c6306 ("net: usb: fix memory leak in smsc75xx_bind")
fails to clean up the work scheduled in smsc75xx_reset->
smsc75xx_set_multicast, which leads to use-after-free if the work is
scheduled to start after the deallocation. In addition, this patch
also removes a dangling pointer - dev->data[0].

This patch calls cancel_work_sync to cancel the scheduled work and set
the dangling pointer to NULL.
