ASoC: soc-core: fix DMI handling

When DMI information is not present, trying to assign the card long
name results in the following warning.

WARNING KERN tegra-audio-graph-card sound: ASoC: no DMI vendor name!

The initial solution suggested was to test if the card device is an
ACPI one. This causes a regression visible to userspace on all Intel
platforms, with UCM unable to load card profiles based on DMI
information: the card devices are not necessarily ACPI ones, e.g. when
the parent creates platform devices on Intel devices.

To fix this problem, this patch exports the existing dmi_available
variable and tests it in the ASoC core.
