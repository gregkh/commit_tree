selftests/bpf: Add tests for target information in bpf_link info queries

Extend the fexit_bpf2bpf test to check that the info for the bpf_link
returned by the kernel matches the expected values.

While we're updating the test, change existing uses of CHEC() to use the
much easier to read ASSERT_*() macros.

v2:
- Convert last CHECK() call and get rid of 'duration' var
- Split ASSERT_OK_PTR() checks to two separate if statements
