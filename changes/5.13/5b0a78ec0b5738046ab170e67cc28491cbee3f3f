drm/i915: Move gt_revoke() slightly

We get a lockdep splat when the reset mutex is held, because it can be
taken from fence_wait. This conflicts with the mmu notifier we have,
because we recurse between reset mutex and mmap lock -> mmu notifier.

Remove this recursion by calling revoke_mmaps before taking the lock.

The reset code still needs fixing, as taking mmap locks during reset
is not allowed.
