net: dsa: ksz: Make reg_mib_cnt a u8 as it never exceeds 255

Currently the for-loop in ksz8_port_init_cnt is causing a static
analysis infinite loop warning with the comparison of
mib->cnt_ptr < dev->reg_mib_cnt. This occurs because mib->cnt_ptr
is a u8 and dev->reg_mib_cnt is an int and the analyzer determines
that mib->cnt_ptr potentially can wrap around to zero if the value
in dev->reg_mib_cnt is > 255. However, this value is never this
large, it is always less than 256 so make reg_mib_cnt a u8.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Infinite loop")
