i2c: altera: use ARCH_INTEL_SOCFPGA also for 32-bit ARM SoCs

ARCH_SOCFPGA is being renamed to ARCH_INTEL_SOCFPGA so adjust the
32-bit ARM drivers to rely on new symbol.

The side effect is that the I2C_ALTERA will now be available for both
32-bit and 64-bit Intel SoCFPGA, even though it is used only for 32-bit.
