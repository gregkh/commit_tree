powerpc: Move arch independent ima kexec functions to drivers/of/kexec.c

The functions defined in "arch/powerpc/kexec/ima.c" handle setting up
and freeing the resources required to carry over the IMA measurement
list from the current kernel to the next kernel across kexec system call.
These functions do not have architecture specific code, but are
currently limited to powerpc.

Move remove_ima_buffer() and setup_ima_buffer() calls into
of_kexec_alloc_and_setup_fdt() defined in "drivers/of/kexec.c".

Move the remaining architecture independent functions from
"arch/powerpc/kexec/ima.c" to "drivers/of/kexec.c".
Delete "arch/powerpc/kexec/ima.c" and "arch/powerpc/include/asm/ima.h".
Remove references to the deleted files and functions in powerpc and
in ima.
