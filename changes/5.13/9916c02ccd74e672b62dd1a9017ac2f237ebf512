soundwire: qcom: cleanup internal port config indexing

Internally used portconfig array for storing port bandwidth
params starts from offset zero. However port zero is not really
used and we also copy the bus parameters to offset zero.
So basically we endup with a code which has to subtract 1 from port
number to get to port parameters.

This is bit confusing to the reader so, make this bit more obvious by only
copying the parameters to offset 1 instead of zero. This will avoid doing
-1 every time when we try to get port params.

Similar thing has been recently done with din/dout_port_mask.
