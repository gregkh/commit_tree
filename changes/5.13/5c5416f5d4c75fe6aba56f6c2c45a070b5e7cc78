net: dsa: no longer clone skb in core driver

It was a waste to clone skb directly in dsa_skb_tx_timestamp().
For one-step timestamping, a clone was not needed. For any failure of
port_txtstamp (this may usually happen), the skb clone had to be freed.

So this patch moves skb cloning for tx timestamp out of dsa core, and
let drivers clone skb in port_txtstamp if they really need.
