net: phy: marvell-88x2222: swap 1G/10G modes on autoneg

Setting 10G without autonegotiation is invalid according to
phy_ethtool_ksettings_set(). Thus, we need to set it during
autonegotiation.

If 1G autonegotiation can't complete for quite a time, but there is
signal in line, switch line interface type to 10GBase-R, if supported,
in hope for link to be established.

And vice versa. If 10GBase-R link can't be established for quite a time,
and autonegotiation is enabled, and there is signal in line, switch line
interface type to appropriate 1G mode, i.e. 1000Base-X or SGMII, if
supported.
