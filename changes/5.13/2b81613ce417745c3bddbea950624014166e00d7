ARM: dts: aspeed: Add ASRock E3C246D4I BMC

This is a relatively low-cost AST2500-based Xeon E-2100/E-2200 series
mini-ITX board that we hope can provide a decent platform for OpenBMC
development.

This initial device-tree provides the necessary configuration for
basic BMC functionality such as host power control, serial console and
KVM support, and POST code snooping.
