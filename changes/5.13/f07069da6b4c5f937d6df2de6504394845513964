drm/ttm: move memory accounting into vmwgfx v4

This is just another feature which is only used by VMWGFX, so move
it into the driver instead.

I've tried to add the accounting sysfs file to the kobject of the drm
minor, but I'm not 100% sure if this works as expected.

v2: fix typo in KFD and avoid 64bit divide
v3: fix init order in VMWGFX
v4: use pdev sysfs reference instead of drm
