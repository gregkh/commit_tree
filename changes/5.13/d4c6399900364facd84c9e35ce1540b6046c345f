vmlinux.lds.h: Avoid orphan section with !SMP

With x86_64_defconfig and the following configs, there is an orphan
section warning:

CONFIG_SMP=n
CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT=y
CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST=y
CONFIG_KVM=y
CONFIG_PARAVIRT=y

ld: warning: orphan section `.data..decrypted' from `arch/x86/kernel/cpu/vmware.o' being placed in section `.data..decrypted'
ld: warning: orphan section `.data..decrypted' from `arch/x86/kernel/kvm.o' being placed in section `.data..decrypted'

These sections are created with DEFINE_PER_CPU_DECRYPTED, which
ultimately turns into __PCPU_ATTRS, which in turn has a section
attribute with a value of PER_CPU_BASE_SECTION + the section name. When
CONFIG_SMP is not set, the base section is .data and that is not
currently handled in any linker script.

Add .data..decrypted to PERCPU_DECRYPTED_SECTION, which is included in
PERCPU_INPUT -> PERCPU_SECTION, which is include in the x86 linker
script when either CONFIG_X86_64 or CONFIG_SMP is unset, taking care of
the warning.
