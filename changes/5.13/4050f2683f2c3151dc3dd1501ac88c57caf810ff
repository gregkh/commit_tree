usb: typec: tcpm: update power supply once partner accepts

power_supply_changed needs to be called to notify clients
after the partner accepts the requested values for the pps
case.

Also, remove the redundant power_supply_changed at the end
of the tcpm_reset_port as power_supply_changed is already
called right after usb_type is changed.
