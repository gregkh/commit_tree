pinctrl: stm32: fix the reported number of GPIO lines per bank

Each GPIO bank supports a variable number of lines which is usually 16, but
is less in some cases : this is specified by the last argument of the
"gpio-ranges" bank node property.
Report to the framework, the actual number of lines, so the libgpiod
gpioinfo command lists the actually existing GPIO lines.
