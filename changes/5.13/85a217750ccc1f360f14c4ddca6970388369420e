dt-bindings: panel/kingdisplay,kd035g6-54nt: Remove spi-cs-high

The NT39016 panel is a fun beast, even though the documentation states
that the CS line is active-low, it will work just fine if the CS line is
configured as active-high, but it won't work if the CS line is forced
low or forced high.

Since it did actually work with the spi-cs-high property, this is not a
bugfix, but we should nonetheless remove that property from the example
to match the documentation.
