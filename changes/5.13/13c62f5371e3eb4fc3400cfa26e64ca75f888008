net/sched: act_ct: handle DNAT tuple collision

This this the counterpart of 8aa7b526dc0b ("openvswitch: handle DNAT
tuple collision") for act_ct. From that commit changelog:

"""
With multiple DNAT rules it's possible that after destination
translation the resulting tuples collide.

...

Netfilter handles this case by allocating a null binding for SNAT at
egress by default.  Perform the same operation in openvswitch for DNAT
if no explicit SNAT is requested by the user and allocate a null binding
for SNAT for packets in the "original" direction.
