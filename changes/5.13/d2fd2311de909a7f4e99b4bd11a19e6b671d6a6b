net: ipa: fix assumptions about DMA address size

Some build time checks in ipa_table_validate_build() assume that a
DMA address is 64 bits wide.  That is more restrictive than it has
to be.  A route or filter table is 64 bits wide no matter what the
size of a DMA address is on the AP.  The code actually uses a
pointer to __le64 to access table entries, and a fixed constant
IPA_TABLE_ENTRY_SIZE to describe the size of those entries.

Loosen up two checks so they still verify some requirements, but
such that they do not assume the size of a DMA address is 64 bits.
