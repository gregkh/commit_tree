scsi: ufs: core: Cancel rpm_dev_flush_recheck_work during system suspend

During ufs system suspend, leaving rpm_dev_flush_recheck_work running or
pending is risky because concurrency may happen between system
suspend/resume and runtime resume routine. Fix this by cancelling
rpm_dev_flush_recheck_work synchronously during system suspend.
