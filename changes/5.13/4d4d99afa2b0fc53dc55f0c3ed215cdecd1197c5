usb: dwc2: Add part. power down exit from dwc2_conn_id_status_change().

Before changing to connector B exiting from Partial
Power Down is required.

- Added exiting from Partial Power Down mode when
  connector ID status changes to "connId B".
  Because if connector ID status changed to B connector
  while core was in partial power down mode, HANG would
  accrue from a soft reset.
