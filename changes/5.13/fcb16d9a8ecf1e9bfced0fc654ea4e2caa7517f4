scsi: qla2xxx: Prevent PRLI in target mode

In a case when the initiator in P2P mode by some circumstances does not
send PRLI, the target, in a case when the target port's WWPN is less than
initiator's, changes the discovery state in DSC_GNL. When gnl completes it
sends PRLI to the initiator.

Usually the initiator in P2P mode always sends PRLI. We caught this issue
on Linux stable v5.4.6 https://www.spinics.net/lists/stable/msg458515.html.

Fix this particular corner case in the behaviour of the P2P mod target
login state machine.
