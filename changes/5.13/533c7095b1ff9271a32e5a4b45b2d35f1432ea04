firmware: arm_scmi: Refactor events registration

Add a new refactored protocol events registration helper and invoke it
from the centralized initialization process triggered by get_ops() and
friends.

Also add a `get_num_sources` as a new optional callback amongst protocol
events operations. Finally remove events registration call-sites from
within the legacy protocol init routines.
