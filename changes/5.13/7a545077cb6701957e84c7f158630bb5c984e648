Revert "net/mlx5: Arm only EQs with EQEs"

In the scenario described below, an EQ can remain in FIRED state which
can result in missing an interrupt generation.

The scenario:

device                       mlx5_core driver
------                       ----------------
EQ1.eqe generated
EQ1.MSI-X sent
EQ1.state = FIRED
EQ2.eqe generated
                             mlx5_irq()
                               polls - eq1_eqes()
                               arm eq1
                               polls - eq2_eqes()
                               arm eq2
EQ2.MSI-X sent
EQ2.state = FIRED
                              mlx5_irq()
                              polls - eq2_eqes() -- no eqes found
                              driver skips EQ arming;

->EQ2 remains fired, misses generating interrupt.

Hence, always arm the EQ by reverting the cited commit in fixes tag.
