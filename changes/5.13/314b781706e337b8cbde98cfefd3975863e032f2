riscv: kasan: Fix MODULES_VADDR evaluation due to local variables' name

commit 2bfc6cd81bd1 ("riscv: Move kernel mapping outside of linear
mapping") makes use of MODULES_VADDR to populate kernel, BPF, modules
mapping. Currently, MODULES_VADDR is defined as below for RV64:

| #define MODULES_VADDR   (PFN_ALIGN((unsigned long)&_end) - SZ_2G)

But kasan_init() has two local variables which are also named as _start,
_end, so MODULES_VADDR is evaluated with the local variable _end
rather than the global "_end" as we expected. Fix this issue by
renaming the two local variables.
