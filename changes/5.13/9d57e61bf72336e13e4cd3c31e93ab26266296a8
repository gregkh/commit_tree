of/pci: Add IORESOURCE_MEM_64 to resource flags for 64-bit memory addresses

Many other resource flag parsers already add this flag when the input
has bits 24 & 25 set, so update this one to do the same.

Some devices (like virtio-net) have more than one memory resource
(like MMIO32 and MMIO64) and without this flag it would be needed to
verify the address range to know which one is which.
