serial: atmel_serial: drop low-latency workaround

Commit 1ecc26bd2789 ("atmel_serial: split the interrupt handler") worked
around the infamous low_latency behaviour of tty_flip_buffer_push() by
dropping and reacquiring the port lock in the tasklet callback.

Since commit a9c3f68f3cd8 ("tty: Fix low_latency BUG"),
tty_flip_buffer_push() always schedules a work item to push data to the
line discipline and there's no need to keep any low_latency hacks around.
