mm/thp: make is_huge_zero_pmd() safe and quicker

Most callers of is_huge_zero_pmd() supply a pmd already verified
present; but a few (notably zap_huge_pmd()) do not - it might be a pmd
migration entry, in which the pfn is encoded differently from a present
pmd: which might pass the is_huge_zero_pmd() test (though not on x86,
since L1TF forced us to protect against that); or perhaps even crash in
pmd_page() applied to a swap-like entry.

Make it safe by adding pmd_present() check into is_huge_zero_pmd()
itself; and make it quicker by saving huge_zero_pfn, so that
is_huge_zero_pmd() will not need to do that pmd_page() lookup each time.

__split_huge_pmd_locked() checked pmd_trans_huge() before: that worked,
but is unnecessary now that is_huge_zero_pmd() checks present.
