block: move more syncing and invalidation to delete_partition

Move the calls to fsync_bdev and __invalidate_device from del_gendisk to
delete_partition.  For the other two callers that check that there are
no openers for the delete partitions(s) the callouts are a no-op as no
file system can be mounted, but this keeps all the cleanup in one
place.
