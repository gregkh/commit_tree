mips: smp-bmips: fix CPU mappings

When booting bmips with SMP enabled on a BCM6358 running on CPU #1 instead of
CPU #0, the current CPU mapping code produces the following:
- smp_processor_id(): 0
- cpu_logical_map(0): 1
- cpu_number_map(0): 1

This is because SMP isn't supported on BCM6358 since it has a shared TLB, so
it is disabled and max_cpus is decreased from 2 to 1.
