block, bfq: fix weight-raising resume with !low_latency

When the io_latency heuristic is off, bfq_queues must not start to be
weight-raised. Unfortunately, by mistake, this may happen when the
state of a previously weight-raised bfq_queue is resumed after a queue
split. This commit fixes this error.
