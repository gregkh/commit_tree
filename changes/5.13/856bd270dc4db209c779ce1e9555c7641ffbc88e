btrfs: return errors from btrfs_del_csums in cleanup_ref_head

We are unconditionally returning 0 in cleanup_ref_head, despite the fact
that btrfs_del_csums could fail.  We need to return the error so the
transaction gets aborted properly, fix this by returning ret from
btrfs_del_csums in cleanup_ref_head.
