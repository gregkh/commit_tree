tracing: Pass buffer of event to trigger operations

The ring_buffer_event_time_stamp() is going to be updated to extract the
time stamp for the event without needing it to be set to have absolute
values for all events. But to do so, it needs the buffer that the event is
on as the buffer saves information for the event before it is committed to
the buffer.

If the trace buffer is disabled, a temporary buffer is used, and there's
no access to this buffer from the current histogram triggers, even though
it is passed to the trace event code.

Pass the buffer that the event is on all the way down to the histogram
triggers.
