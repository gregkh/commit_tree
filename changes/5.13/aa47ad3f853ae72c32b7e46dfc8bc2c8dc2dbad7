mfd: intel_pmt: Add support for DG1

Adds PMT Telemetry aggregator support for the DG1 graphics PCIe card. The
device does not have the DVSEC region in its PCI config space so hard
code the discovery table data in the driver. Also requires a fix for DG1
in the Telemetry driver for how the ACCESS_TYPE field is used.
