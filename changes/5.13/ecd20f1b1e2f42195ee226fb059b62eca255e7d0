staging: rtl8723bs: tidy up some error handling in core/rtw_mlme.c

the RT_TRACE() output is not useful so we want to delete it. In this case
there is no cleanup for rtw_cleanbss_cmd() required or even possible. I've
deleted the RT_TRACE() output and added a goto unlock to show
that we can't continue if rtw_createbss_cmd() fails.
