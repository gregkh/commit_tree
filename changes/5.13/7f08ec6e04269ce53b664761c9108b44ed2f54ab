net-sysfs: remove possible sleep from an RCU read-side critical section

xps_queue_show is mostly made of an RCU read-side critical section and
calls bitmap_zalloc with GFP_KERNEL in the middle of it. That is not
allowed as this call may sleep and such behaviours aren't allowed in RCU
read-side critical sections. Fix this by using GFP_NOWAIT instead.
