ALSA: hda/realtek: Remove redundant entry for ALC861 Haier/Uniwill devices

The quirk entry for Uniwill ECS M31EI is with the PCI SSID device 0,
which means matching with all.  That is, it's essentially equivalent
with SND_PCI_QUIRK_VENDOR(0x1584), which also matches with the
previous entry for Haier W18 applying the very same quirk.

Let's unify them with the single vendor-quirk entry.
