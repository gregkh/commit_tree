genirq: Reduce irqdebug cacheline bouncing

note_interrupt() increments desc->irq_count for each interrupt even for
percpu interrupt handlers, even when they are handled successfully. This
causes cacheline bouncing and limits scalability.

Instead of incrementing irq_count every time, only start incrementing it
after seeing an unhandled irq, which should avoid the cache line
bouncing in the common path.

This actually should give better consistency in handling misbehaving
irqs too, because instead of the first unhandled irq arriving at an
arbitrary point in the irq_count cycle, its arrival will begin the
irq_count cycle.
