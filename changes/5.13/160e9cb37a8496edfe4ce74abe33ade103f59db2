net/mlx5: DR, Add support for dynamic flex parser

Flex parser is a HW parser that can support protocols that are not
natively supported by the HCA, such as Geneve (TLV options) and GTP-U.
There are 8 such parsers, and each of them can be assigned to parse a
specific set of protocols.
This patch adds misc4 match params which allows using a correct flex parser
that was programmed to the required protocol.
