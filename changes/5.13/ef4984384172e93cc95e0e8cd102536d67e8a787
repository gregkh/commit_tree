mm/compaction: remove unused variable sysctl_compact_memory

The sysctl_compact_memory is mostly unused in mm/compaction.c It just
acts as a place holder for sysctl to store .data.

But the .data itself is not needed here.

So we can get ride of this variable completely and make .data as NULL.
This will also eliminate the extern declaration from header file.  No
functionality is broken or changed this way.
