ice: handle increasing Tx or Rx ring sizes

There is an issue when the Tx or Rx ring size increases using
'ethtool -L ...' where the new rings don't get the correct ITR
values because when we rebuild the VSI we don't know that some
of the rings may be new.

Fix this by looking at the original number of rings and
determining if the rings in ice_vsi_rebuild_set_coalesce()
were not present in the original rings received in
ice_vsi_rebuild_get_coalesce().

Also change the code to return an error if we can't allocate
memory for the coalesce data in ice_vsi_rebuild().
