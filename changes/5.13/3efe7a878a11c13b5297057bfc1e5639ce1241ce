clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Prepare to handle dra7 timer wrap issue

There is a timer wrap issue on dra7 for the ARM architected timer.
In a typical clock configuration the timer fails to wrap after 388 days.

To work around the issue, we need to use timer-ti-dm timers instead.

Let's prepare for adding support for percpu timers by adding a common
dmtimer_clkevt_init_common() and call it from dmtimer_clockevent_init().
This patch makes no intentional functional changes.
