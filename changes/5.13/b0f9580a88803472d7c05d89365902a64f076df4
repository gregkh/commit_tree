scripts: get_abi.pl: better handle escape chars on what:

The parser for the symbols defined on What: doesn't cover all
chars that need to be scaped, like '{' and '}'. Change the logic
to be more generic, and ensure that the same regex will be used
on both What: and when parsing the cross-references.
