bnxt_en: Set BNXT_STATE_FW_RESET_DET flag earlier for the RDMA driver.

During ifup, if the driver detects that firmware has gone through a
reset, it will go through a re-probe sequence.  If the RDMA driver is
loaded, the re-probe sequence includes calling the RDMA driver to stop.
We need to set the BNXT_STATE_FW_RESET_DET flag earlier so that it is
visible to the RDMA driver.  The RDMA driver's stop sequence is
different if firmware has gone through a reset.
