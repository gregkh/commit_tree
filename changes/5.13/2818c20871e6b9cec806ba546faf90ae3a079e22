drm/rockchip: Remove unused variable

Commit 977697e20b3d ("drm/atomic: Pass the full state to planes atomic
disable and update") added the old_state variable instead of what used
to be a parameter, but it also removed the sole user of that variable in
the vop_plane_atomic_update function leading to an usused variable.
Remove it.
