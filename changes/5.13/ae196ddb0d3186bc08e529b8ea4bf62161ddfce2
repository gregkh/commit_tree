usb: typec: Port mapping utility

Adding functions that can be used to link/unlink ports -
USB ports, TBT3/USB4 ports, DisplayPorts and so on - to
the USB Type-C connectors they are attached to inside a
system. The symlink that is created for the port device is
named "connector".

Initially only ACPI is supported. ACPI port object shares
the _PLD (Physical Location of Device) with the USB Type-C
connector that it's attached to.
