signal: Deliver all of the siginfo perf data in _perf

Don't abuse si_errno and deliver all of the perf data in _perf member
of siginfo_t.

Note: The data field in the perf data structures in a u64 to allow a
pointer to be encoded without needed to implement a 32bit and 64bit
version of the same structure.  There already exists a 32bit and 64bit
versions siginfo_t, and the 32bit version can not include a 64bit
member as it only has 32bit alignment.  So unsigned long is used in
siginfo_t instead of a u64 as unsigned long can encode a pointer on
all architectures linux supports.
