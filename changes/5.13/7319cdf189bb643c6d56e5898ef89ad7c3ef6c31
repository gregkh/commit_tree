media: camss: Add support for VFE hardware version Titan 170

Add register definitions for version 170 of the Titan architecture
and implement support for the RDI output mode.

The RDI mode as opposed to the PIX output mode for the VFE unit does
not support any ISP functionality. This means essentially only
supporting dumping the output of the whatever the CSI decoder receives
from the sensor.

For example will a sensor outputting YUV pixel format frames, only
allow the VFE to dump those frames as they are received by the ISP
to memory through the RDI interface.
