scsi: lpfc: Fix vport indices in lpfc_find_vport_by_vpid()

Calls to lpfc_find_vport_by_vpid() for the highest indexed vport fails with
error, "2936 Could not find Vport mapped to vpi XXX".  Our vport indices in
the loop and if-clauses were off by one.

Correct the vpid range used for vpi lookup to include the highest possible
vpid.
