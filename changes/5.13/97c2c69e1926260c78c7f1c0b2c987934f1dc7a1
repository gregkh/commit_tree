virtio-net: support XDP when not more queues

The number of queues implemented by many virtio backends is limited,
especially some machines have a large number of CPUs. In this case, it
is often impossible to allocate a separate queue for
XDP_TX/XDP_REDIRECT, then xdp cannot be loaded to work, even xdp does
not use the XDP_TX/XDP_REDIRECT.

This patch allows XDP_TX/XDP_REDIRECT to run by reuse the existing SQ
with __netif_tx_lock() hold when there are not enough queues.
