net: sock: fix in-kernel mark setting

This patch fixes the in-kernel mark setting by doing an additional
sk_dst_reset() which was introduced by commit 50254256f382 ("sock: Reset
dst when changing sk_mark via setsockopt"). The code is now shared to
avoid any further suprises when changing the socket mark value.

Fixes: 84d1c617402e ("net: sock: add sock_set_mark")
