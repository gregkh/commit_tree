soundwire: generic_allocation: fix confusion between group and packing

The existing code makes no sense, we multiply a channel number by
zero (SDW_BLK_GRP_CNT_1), and the result is used to configure the
block packing mode. Sampling grouping and channel packing are two
separate concepts in SoundWire.

In addition, the bandwidth allocation allocates a vertical slice for
each stream, which makes the use of the PER_CHANNEL packing mode
irrelevant.

Let's use the proper definition for block packing mode (PER_PORT).

This change has no functional impact though since the net result is
the same configuration of the DPN_BlockCtrl3 register, when
implemented.
