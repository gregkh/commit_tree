net: ipa: fix inter-EE IRQ register definitions

In gsi_irq_setup(), two registers are written with the intention of
disabling inter-EE channel and event IRQs.

But the wrong registers are used (and defined); the ones used are
read-only registers that indicate whether the interrupt condition is
present.

Define the mask registers instead of the status registers, and use
them to disable the inter-EE interrupt types.
