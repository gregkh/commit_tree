kvfree_rcu: Make krc_this_cpu_unlock() use raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore()

The krc_this_cpu_unlock() function does a raw_spin_unlock() immediately
followed by a local_irq_restore().  This commit saves a line of code by
merging them into a raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore().  This transformation
also reduces scheduling latency because raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore()
responds immediately to a reschedule request.  In contrast,
local_irq_restore() does a scheduling-oblivious enabling of interrupts.
