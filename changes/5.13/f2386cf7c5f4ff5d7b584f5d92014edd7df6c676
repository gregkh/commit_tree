net: lantiq: disable interrupt before sheduling NAPI

This patch fixes TX hangs with threaded NAPI enabled. The scheduled
NAPI seems to be executed in parallel with the interrupt on second
thread. Sometimes it happens that ltq_dma_disable_irq() is executed
after xrx200_tx_housekeeping(). The symptom is that TX interrupts
are disabled in the DMA controller. As a result, the TX hangs after
a few seconds of the iperf test. Scheduling NAPI after disabling
interrupts fixes this issue.

Tested on Lantiq xRX200 (BT Home Hub 5A).
