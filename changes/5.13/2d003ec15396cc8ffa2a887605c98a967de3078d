ASoC: codecs: lpass-rx-macro: Fix uninitialized variable ec_tx

There is potential read of the uninitialized variable ec_tx if the call
to snd_soc_component_read fails or returns an unrecognized w->name. To
avoid this corner case, initialize ec_tx to -1 so that it is caught
later when ec_tx is bounds checked.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
