mtd: cfi_cmdset_0002: Disable buffered writes for AMD chip 0x2201

Buffer writes do not work with AMD chip 0x2201. The chip in question
is a AMD/Spansion/Cypress Semiconductor S29GL256N and datasheet [1]
talks about writing buffers being possible. While waiting for a neater
solution resort to writing word-sized chunks only.

Without the patch kernel logs will be flooded with entries like below:

jffs2_scan_eraseblock(): End of filesystem marker found at 0x0
jffs2_build_filesystem(): unlocking the mtd device...
done.
jffs2_build_filesystem(): erasing all blocks after the end marker...
MTD do_write_buffer_wait(): software timeout, address:0x01ec000a.
jffs2: Write clean marker to block at 0x01920000 failed: -5
MTD do_write_buffer_wait(): software timeout, address:0x01e2000a.
jffs2: Write clean marker to block at 0x01880000 failed: -5
MTD do_write_buffer_wait(): software timeout, address:0x01e0000a.
jffs2: Write clean marker to block at 0x01860000 failed: -5
MTD do_write_buffer_wait(): software timeout, address:0x01dc000a.
jffs2: Write clean marker to block at 0x01820000 failed: -5
MTD do_write_buffer_wait(): software timeout, address:0x01da000a.

Tested on a Buffalo wzr-hp-g300nh running kernel 5.10.16.
