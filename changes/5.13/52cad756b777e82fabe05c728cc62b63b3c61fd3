ASoC: intel, keembay-i2s: Fix a dt_binding_check warning

The property "dmas" contains two items: DMA "TX" and "RX" channel,
Therefore, its value also needs to be written in two parts.

Otherwise, below YAML check warning is reported:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/intel,keembay-i2s.example.dt.yaml:\
i2s@20140000: dmas: [[4294967295, 29, 4294967295, 33]] is too short
