efi: cper: fix snprintf() use in cper_dimm_err_location()

snprintf() should be given the full buffer size, not one less. And it
guarantees nul-termination, so doing it manually afterwards is
pointless.

It's even potentially harmful (though probably not in practice because
CPER_REC_LEN is 256), due to the "return how much would have been
written had the buffer been big enough" semantics. I.e., if the bank
and/or device strings are long enough that the "DIMM location ..."
output gets truncated, writing to msg[n] is a buffer overflow.
