software node: Handle software node injection to an existing device properly

The function software_node_notify() - the function that creates
and removes the symlinks between the node and the device - was
called unconditionally in device_add_software_node() and
device_remove_software_node(), but it needs to be called in
those functions only in the special case where the node is
added to a device that has already been registered.

This fixes NULL pointer dereference that happens if
device_remove_software_node() is used with device that was
never registered.
