usb: pd: Set PD_T_SINK_WAIT_CAP to 310ms

Current timer PD_T_SINK_WAIT_CAP is set to 240ms which will violate the
SinkWaitCapTimer (tTypeCSinkWaitCap 310 - 620 ms) defined in the PD
Spec if the port is faster enough when running the state machine. Set it
to the lower bound 310ms to ensure the timeout is in Spec.
