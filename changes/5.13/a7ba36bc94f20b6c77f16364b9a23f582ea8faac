ext4: fix fast commit alignment issues

Fast commit recovery data on disk may not be aligned. So, when the
recovery code reads it, this patch makes sure that fast commit info
found on-disk is first memcpy-ed into an aligned variable before
accessing it. As a consequence of it, we also remove some macros that
could resulted in unaligned accesses.
