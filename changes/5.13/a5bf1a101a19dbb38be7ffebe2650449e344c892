drivers: staging: netlogic: fix unmet dependency for PHYLIB

When NETLOGIC_XLR_NET is enabled, and NETDEVICES is
disabled, Kbuild gives the following warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for PHYLIB
  Depends on [n]: NETDEVICES [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - NETLOGIC_XLR_NET [=y] && STAGING [=y] && CPU_XLR [=y]

This is because NETLOGIC_XLR_NET selects PHYLIB
without selecting or depending on NETDEVICES,
despite PHYLIB depending on NETDEVICES.
