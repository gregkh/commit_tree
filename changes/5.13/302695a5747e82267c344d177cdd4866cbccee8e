KVM: x86/mmu: Move flushing for "slot" handlers to caller for legacy MMU

Place the onus on the caller of slot_handle_*() to flush the TLB, rather
than handling the flush in the helper, and rename parameters accordingly.
This will allow future patches to coalesce flushes between address spaces
and between the legacy and TDP MMUs.

No functional change intended.
