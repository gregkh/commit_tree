platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Uninitialized data in pmc_core_lpm_latch_mode_write()

The simple_write_to_buffer() can return success if even a single byte
is copied from user space.  In this case it can result in using
uninitalized data if the buf[] array is not fully initialized.  Really
we should only succeed if the whole buffer is copied.

Just using copy_from_user() is simpler and more appropriate.
