tick/nohz: Only check for RCU deferred wakeup on user/guest entry when needed

Checking for and processing RCU-nocb deferred wakeup upon user/guest
entry is only relevant when nohz_full runs on the local CPU, otherwise
the periodic tick should take care of it.

Make sure we don't needlessly pollute these fast-paths as a -3%
performance regression on a will-it-scale.per_process_ops has been
reported so far.
