net: macb: simplify clk_init with dev_err_probe

On some platforms, e.g., the ZynqMP, devm_clk_get can return
-EPROBE_DEFER if the clock controller, which is implemented in firmware,
has not been probed yet.

As clk_init is only called during probe, use dev_err_probe to simplify
the error message and hide it for -EPROBE_DEFER.
