ARM: dts: mvebu: fix SPI device node

dtc warns about a mismatched address:

arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-385-atl-x530.dts:171.14-199.4: Warning (spi_bus_reg): /soc/spi@10680/spi-flash@0: SPI bus unit address format error, expected "1"

I assume the "reg" property is correct here, so adjust the unit address
accordingly.
