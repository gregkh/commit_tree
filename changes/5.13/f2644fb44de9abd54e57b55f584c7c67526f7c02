selftests/bpf: Add function linking selftest

Add selftest validating various aspects of statically linking functions:
  - no conflicts and correct resolution for name-conflicting static funcs;
  - correct resolution of extern functions;
  - correct handling of weak functions, both resolution itself and libbpf's
    handling of unused weak function that "lost" (it leaves gaps in code with
    no ELF symbols);
  - correct handling of hidden visibility to turn global function into
    "static" for the purpose of BPF verification.
