ASoC: rt5659: Fix the lost powers for the HDA header

The power of "LDO2", "MICBIAS1" and "Mic Det Power" were powered off after
the DAPM widgets were added, and these powers were set by the JD settings
"RT5659_JD_HDA_HEADER" in the probe function. In the codec probe function,
these powers were ignored to prevent them controlled by DAPM.
