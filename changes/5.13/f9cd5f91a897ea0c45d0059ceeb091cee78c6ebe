powerpc: Avoid clang uninitialized warning in __get_user_size_allowed

Commit 9975f852ce1b ("powerpc/uaccess: Remove calls to __get_user_bad()
and __put_user_bad()") switch to BUILD_BUG() in the default case, which
leaves x uninitialized. This will not be an issue because the build will
be broken in that case but clang does static analysis before it realizes
the default case will be done so it warns about x being uninitialized
(trimmed for brevity):

Commit 5cd29b1fd3e8 ("powerpc/uaccess: Use asm goto for get_user when
compiler supports it") added an initialization for x because of the same
reason. Do the same thing here so there is no warning across all
versions of clang.
