mm/page_alloc: do bulk array bounds check after checking populated elements

Dan Carpenter reported the following

  The patch 0f87d9d30f21: "mm/page_alloc: add an array-based interface
  to the bulk page allocator" from Apr 29, 2021, leads to the following
  static checker warning:

        mm/page_alloc.c:5338 __alloc_pages_bulk()
        warn: potentially one past the end of array 'page_array[nr_populated]'

The problem can occur if an array is passed in that is fully populated.
That potentially ends up allocating a single page and storing it past
the end of the array.  This patch returns 0 if the array is fully
populated.
