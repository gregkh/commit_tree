userfaultfd: hugetlbfs: fix new flag usage in error path

In commit d6995da31122 ("hugetlb: use page.private for hugetlb specific
page flags") the use of PagePrivate to indicate a reservation count
should be restored at free time was changed to the hugetlb specific flag
HPageRestoreReserve.  Changes to a userfaultfd error path as well as a
VM_BUG_ON() in remove_inode_hugepages() were overlooked.

Users could see incorrect hugetlb reserve counts if they experience an
error with a UFFDIO_COPY operation.  Specifically, this would be the
result of an unlikely copy_huge_page_from_user error.  There is not an
increased chance of hitting the VM_BUG_ON.
