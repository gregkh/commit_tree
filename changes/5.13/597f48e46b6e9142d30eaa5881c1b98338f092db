nexthop: Pass nh_config to replace_nexthop()

Currently, replace assumes that the new group that is given is a
fully-formed object. But mpath groups really only have one attribute, and
that is the constituent next hop configuration. This may not be universally
true. From the usability perspective, it is desirable to allow the replace
operation to adjust just the constituent next hop configuration and leave
the group attributes as such intact.

But the object that keeps track of whether an attribute was or was not
given is the nh_config object, not the next hop or next-hop group. To allow
(selective) attribute updates during NH group replacement, propagate `cfg'
to replace_nexthop() and further to replace_nexthop_grp().
