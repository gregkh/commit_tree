gfs2: Fix a number of kernel-doc warnings

Building the kernel with W=1 results in a number of kernel-doc warnings
like incorrect function names and parameter descriptions.  Fix those,
mostly by adding missing parameter descriptions, removing left-over
descriptions, and demoting some less important kernel-doc comments into
regular comments.

Originally proposed by Lee Jones; improved and combined into a single
patch by Andreas.
