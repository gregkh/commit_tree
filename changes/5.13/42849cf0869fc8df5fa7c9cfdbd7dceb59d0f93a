media: imx: imx7_media-csi: Add support for additional Bayer patterns

The CSI driver only supports the BGGR Bayer patterns currently. The
hardware supports all patterns (the only pattern-dependent hardware
operation is statistics calculation, as de-bayering isn't supported),
enable them in the driver too.
