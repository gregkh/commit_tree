drm/amdgpu: mask the xgmi number of hops reported from psp to kfd

The psp supplies the link type in the upper 2 bits of the psp xgmi node
information num_hops field.  With a new link type, Aldebaran has these
bits set to a non-zero value (1 = xGMI3) so the KFD topology will report
the incorrect IO link weights without proper masking.
The actual number of hops is located in the 3 least significant bits of
this field so mask if off accordingly before passing it to the KFD.
