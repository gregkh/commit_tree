drm/i915: Individual request cancellation

Currently, we cancel outstanding requests within a context when the
context is closed. We may also want to cancel individual requests using
the same graceful preemption mechanism.

v2 (Tvrtko):
 * Cancel waiters carefully considering no timeline lock and RCU.
 * Fixed selftests.

v3 (Tvrtko):
 * Remove error propagation to waiters for now.

v4 (Tvrtko):
 * Rebase for extracted i915_request_active_engine. (Matt)
