net: ipconfig: Don't override command-line hostnames or domains

If the user specifies a hostname or domain name as part of the ip=
command-line option, preserve it and don't overwrite it with one
supplied by DHCP/BOOTP.

For instance, ip=::::myhostname::dhcp will use "myhostname" rather than
ignoring and overwriting it.

Fix the comment on ic_bootp_string that suggests it only copies a string
"if not already set"; it doesn't have any such logic.
