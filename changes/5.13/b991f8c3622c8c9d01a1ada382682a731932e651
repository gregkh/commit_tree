pinctrl: core: Handling pinmux and pinconf separately

Right now the handling order depends on how entries are coming which is
corresponding with order in DT. We have reached the case with DT overlays
where conf and mux descriptions are exchanged which ends up in sequence
that firmware has been asked to perform configuration before requesting the
pin.

The patch is enforcing the order that pin is requested all the time first
followed by pin configuration. This change will ensure that firmware gets
requests in the right order.
