regulator: max77620: Use device_set_of_node_from_dev()

The MAX77620 driver fails to re-probe on deferred probe because driver
core tries to claim resources that are already claimed by the PINCTRL
device. Use device_set_of_node_from_dev() helper which marks OF node as
reused, skipping erroneous execution of pinctrl_bind_pins() for the PMIC
device on the re-probe.
