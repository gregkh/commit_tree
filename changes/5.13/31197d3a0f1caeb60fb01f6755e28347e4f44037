objtool/x86: Ignore __x86_indirect_alt_* symbols

Because the __x86_indirect_alt* symbols are just that, objtool will
try and validate them as regular symbols, instead of the alternative
replacements that they are.

This goes sideways for FRAME_POINTER=y builds; which generate a fair
amount of warnings.
