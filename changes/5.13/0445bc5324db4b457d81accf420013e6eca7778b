media: imx: imx7_mipi_csis: Drop 10-bit YUV support

The data type specified for 10-bit YUV is the same as 8-bit YUV. This is
wrong, and has thus clearly not been tested. Instead of fixing data type
without being able to test it, drop it. It can be added back later when
someone will have access to a 10-bit YUV source to this it.
