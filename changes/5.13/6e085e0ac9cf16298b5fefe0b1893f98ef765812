arm/arm64: Probe for the presence of KVM hypervisor

Although the SMCCC specification provides some limited functionality for
describing the presence of hypervisor and firmware services, this is
generally applicable only to functions designated as "Arm Architecture
Service Functions" and no portable discovery mechanism is provided for
standard hypervisor services, despite having a designated range of
function identifiers reserved by the specification.

In an attempt to avoid the need for additional firmware changes every
time a new function is added, introduce a UID to identify the service
provider as being compatible with KVM. Once this has been established,
additional services can be discovered via a feature bitmap.
