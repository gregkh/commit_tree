Revert "irqbypass: do not start cons/prod when failed connect"

This reverts commit a979a6aa009f3c99689432e0cdb5402a4463fb88.

The reverted commit may cause VM freeze on arm64 with GICv4,
where stopping a consumer is implemented by suspending the VM.
Should the connect fail, the VM will not be resumed, which
is a bit of a problem.

It also erroneously calls the producer destructor unconditionally,
which is unexpected.
