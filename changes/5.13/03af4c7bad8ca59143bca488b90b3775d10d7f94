libceph: set global_id as soon as we get an auth ticket

Commit 61ca49a9105f ("libceph: don't set global_id until we get an
auth ticket") delayed the setting of global_id too much.  It is set
only after all tickets are received, but in pre-nautilus clusters an
auth ticket and the service tickets are obtained in separate steps
(for a total of three MAuth replies).  When the service tickets are
requested, global_id is used to build an authorizer; if global_id is
still 0 we never get them and fail to establish the session.

Moving the setting of global_id into protocol implementations.  This
way global_id can be set exactly when an auth ticket is received, not
sooner nor later.
