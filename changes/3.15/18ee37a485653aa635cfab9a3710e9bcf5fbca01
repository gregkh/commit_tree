    drm/crtc-helpers: fix dpms on logic

which was merged into 3.15-rc1, broke resume on radeons. Strangely git
bisect lead everyone to

    drm/crtc-helper: explicit DPMS on after modeset

which was merged long ago and actually part of 3.14.

Digging deeper I've noticed (again) that the call to
drm_helper_resume_force_mode in the radeon resume handlers was a no-op
previously because everything gets shut down on suspend. radeon does
this with explicit calls to drm_helper_connector_dpms with DPMS_OFF.
But with 177c we now force the dpms state to ON, so suddenly
resume_force_mode actually forced the crtcs back on.

This is the intention of the change after all, the problem is that
radeon resumes the fbdev console layer _before_ restoring the display,
through calling fb_set_suspend. And fbcon does an immediate ->set_par,
which in turn causes the same forced mode restore to happen.

Two concurrent modeset operations didn't lead to happiness. Fix this
by delaying the fbcon resume until the end of the readeon resum
functions.

v2: Fix up a bit of the spelling fail.
