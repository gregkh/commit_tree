ceph: clear directory's completeness when creating file

When creating a file, ceph_set_dentry_offset() puts the new dentry
at the end of directory's d_subdirs, then set the dentry's offset
based on directory's max offset. The offset does not reflect the
real postion of the dentry in directory. Later readdir reply from
MDS may change the dentry's position/offset. This inconsistency
can cause missing/duplicate entries in readdir result if readdir
is partly satisfied by dcache_readdir().

The fix is clear directory's completeness after creating/renaming
file. It prevents later readdir from using dcache_readdir().
