fs: push sync_filesystem() down to the file system's remount_fs()

Previously, the no-op "mount -o mount /dev/xxx" operation when the
file system is already mounted read-write causes an implied,
unconditional syncfs().  This seems pretty stupid, and it's certainly
documented or guaraunteed to do this, nor is it particularly useful,
except in the case where the file system was mounted rw and is getting
remounted read-only.

However, it's possible that there might be some file systems that are
actually depending on this behavior.  In most file systems, it's
probably fine to only call sync_filesystem() when transitioning from
read-write to read-only, and there are some file systems where this is
not needed at all (for example, for a pseudo-filesystem or something
like romfs).
