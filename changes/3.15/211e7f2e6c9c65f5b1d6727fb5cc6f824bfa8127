[media] DocBook media: drop the old incorrect packed RGB table

The old table is most definitely wrong. All applications and all
drivers that I have ever tested follow the corrected table. Furthermore,
that's what all applications expect as well. Any drivers that do not
follow the corrected table are broken and should be fixed.

This patch drops the old table and replaces it with the corrected
table. This should prevent a lot of confusion.
