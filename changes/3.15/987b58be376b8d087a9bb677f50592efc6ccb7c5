tipc: make broadcast bearer store in bearer_list array

Now unicast bearer is dynamically allocated and placed into its
identity specified slot of bearer_list array. When we search
bearer_list array with a bearer identity, the corresponding bearer
instance can be found. But broadcast bearer is statically allocated
and it is not located in the bearer_list array yet. So we decide to
enlarge bearer_list array into MAX_BEARERS + 1 slots, and its last
slot stores the broadcast bearer so that the broadcast bearer can
be found from bearer_list array with MAX_BEARERS as index. The
change will help us reduce the complex relationship between bearer
and link in the future.
