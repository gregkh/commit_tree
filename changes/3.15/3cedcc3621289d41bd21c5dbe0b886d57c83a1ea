PCI: Don't enable decoding if BAR hasn't been assigned an address

Don't enable memory or I/O decoding if we haven't assigned or claimed the
BAR's resource.

If we enable decoding for a BAR that hasn't been assigned an address, we'll
likely cause bus conflicts.  This declines to enable decoding for resources
with IORESOURCE_UNSET.

Note that drivers can use pci_enable_device_io() or pci_enable_device_mem()
if they only care about specific types of BARs.  In that case, we don't
bother checking whether the corresponding resources are assigned or
claimed.
