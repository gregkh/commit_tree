mach64: fix cursor when character width is not a multiple of 8 pixels

This patch fixes the hardware cursor on mach64 when font width is not a
multiple of 8 pixels.

If you load such a font, the cursor is expanded to the next 8-byte
boundary and a part of the next character after the cursor is not
visible.
For example, when you load a font with 12-pixel width, the cursor width
is 16 pixels and when the cursor is displayed, 4 pixels of the next
character are not visible.

The reason is this: atyfb_cursor is called with proper parameters to
load an image that is 12-pixel wide. However, the number is aligned on
the next 8-pixel boundary on the line
"unsigned int width = (cursor->image.width + 7) >> 3;" and the whole
function acts as it is was loading a 16-pixel image.

This patch fixes it so that the value written to the framebuffer is
padded with 0xaaaa (the transparent pattern) when the image size it not
a multiple of 8 pixels. The transparent pattern causes that the cursor
will not interfere with the next character.
