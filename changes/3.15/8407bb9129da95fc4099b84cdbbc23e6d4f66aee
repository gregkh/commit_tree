drm/i915/bdw: Use scratch page table for GEN8 PPGTT

I'm not clear if the hardware is still subject to the same prefetching
issues that made us use a scratch page in the first place. In either
case, we're using garbage with the current code (we will end up using
offset 0).

This may be the cause of our current gem_cpu_reloc regression with
PPGTT. I cannot test it at the moment.
