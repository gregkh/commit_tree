Bluetooth: Fix advertising address type when toggling connectable

When the connectable setting is toggled using mgmt_set_connectable the
HCI_CONNECTABLE flag will only be set once the related HCI commands
succeed. When determining what kind of advertising to do we need to
therefore also check whether there is a pending Set Connectable command
in addition to the current flag value.

The enable_advertising function was already taking care of this for the
advertising type with the help of the get_adv_type function, but was
failing to do the same for the address type selection. This patch
converts the get_adv_type function to be more generic in that it returns
the expected connectable state and updates the enable_advertising
function to use the return value both for the advertising type as well
as the advertising address type.
