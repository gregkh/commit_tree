xen: remove XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST

This patch removes the Kconfig symbol XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST which is
used nowhere in the tree.

We do know grub2 has a script that greps kernel configuration files for
its macro. It shouldn't do that. As Linus summarized:
    This is a grub bug. It really is that simple. Treat it as one.

Besides, grub2's grepping for that macro is actually superfluous. See,
that script currently contains this test (simplified):
    grep -x CONFIG_XEN_DOM0=y $config || grep -x CONFIG_XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST=y $config

But since XEN_DOM0 and XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST are by definition equal,
removing XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST cannot influence this test.

So there's no reason to not remove this symbol, like we do with all
unused Kconfig symbols.
