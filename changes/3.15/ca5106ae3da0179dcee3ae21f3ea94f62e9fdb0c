ASoC: dapm: Skip CODEC<->CODEC links in connect_dai_link_widgets()

For CODEC to CODEC DAI links the paths are created in snd_soc_dapm_new_pcm().
Also for CODEC to CODEC links the widgets are connected cross-over via a DAI
link widget, meaning that the capture widget of one CODEC will be connected to
the playback widget of the other and vice versa. Whereas
snd_soc_dapm_connect_dai_link_widgets() directly connects the playback widget of
the CPU DAI to the playback widget of the CODEC DAI and the capture widget of
the CPU DAI to the capture widget of the CODEC DAI. So not skipping
CODEC<->CODEC links in snd_soc_dapm_connect_dai_link_widgets() will create
incorrect connections between the two CODECs which will cause DAPM to detect
active paths where there are none and unnecessarily power up widgets.
