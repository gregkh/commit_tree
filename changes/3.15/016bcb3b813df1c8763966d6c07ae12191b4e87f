drm/msm: drop ARCH_MSM Kconfig depend

The ARCH_MSM depend is redundant with ARCH_MSM8960, so we can remove it.
Additionally, we are splitting Qualcomm MSM support into legacy (ARCH_MSM)
and multiplatform (ARCH_QCOM).  The MSM8960 with be ARCH_QCOM going forward
so dropping ARCH_MSM will work properly for the new ARCH_QCOM multiplatform
build.
