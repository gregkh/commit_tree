ext4: use filemap_write_and_wait_range() correctly in collapse range

Currently we're passing -1 as lend argumnet for
filemap_write_and_wait_range() which is wrong since lend is signed type
so it would cause some confusion and we might not write_and_wait for the
entire range we're expecting to write.

Fix it by using LLONG_MAX instead.
