staging: usbip: convert usbip-host driver to usb_device_driver

This driver was previously an interface driver. Since USB/IP
exports a whole device, not just an interface, it would make
sense to be a device driver.

This patch also modifies the way userspace sees and uses a
shared device:

* the usbip_status file is no longer created for interface 0, but for
the whole device (such as
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.2/usb1/1-1/usbip_status).
* per interface information, such as interface class or protocol, is
no longer sent/received; only device specific information is
transmitted.
* since the driver was moved one level below in the USB architecture,
there is no need to bind/unbind each interface, just the device as a
whole.
