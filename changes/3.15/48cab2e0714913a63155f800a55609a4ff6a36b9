Btrfs: fix the skipped transaction commit during the file sync

We may abort the wait earlier if ->last_trans_log_full_commit was set to
the current transaction id, at this case, we need commit the current
transaction instead of the log sub-transaction. But the current code
didn't tell the caller to do it (return 0, not -EAGAIN). Fix it.
