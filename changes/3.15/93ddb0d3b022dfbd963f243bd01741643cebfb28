drm/msm: validate flags, etc

After reading a nice article on LWN[1], I went back and double checked
my handling of invalid-input checking.  Turns out there were a couple
places I had missed.

Since the driver is fairly young, and the devices it supports are really
only just barely usable for basic stuff (serial console) with an
upstream kernel, I think we should fix this now and revert specific
parts of this patch later in the unlikely event that a regression is
reported.
