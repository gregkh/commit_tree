Btrfs: fix deadlock with nested trans handles

Zach found this deadlock that would happen like this

btrfs_end_transaction <- reduce trans->use_count to 0
  btrfs_run_delayed_refs
    btrfs_cow_block
      find_free_extent
	btrfs_start_transaction <- increase trans->use_count to 1
          allocate chunk
	btrfs_end_transaction <- decrease trans->use_count to 0
	  btrfs_run_delayed_refs
	    lock tree block we are cowing above ^^

We need to only decrease trans->use_count if it is above 1, otherwise leave it
alone.  This will make nested trans be the only ones who decrease their added
ref, and will let us get rid of the trans->use_count++ hack if we have to commit
the transaction.  Thanks,
