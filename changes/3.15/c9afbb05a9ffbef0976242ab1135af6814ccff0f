regmap: spmi: support base and extended register spaces

SPMI states that a slave may contain two register spaces, the Base
register space is a 5-bit byte-addressable space accessed via the
Register Read/Write and Register Zero Write command sequences, and the
Extended register space: a 16-bit byte-addressable space accessed via
the Extended Read/Write and Extended Read/Write Long command sequences.

Provide support for accessing both of these spaces, taking advantage of
the more bandwidth-efficient commands ('Register 0 Write' vs 'Register
Write', and 'Extended Register Read/Write' vs 'Extended Register
Read/Write Long') when possible.
