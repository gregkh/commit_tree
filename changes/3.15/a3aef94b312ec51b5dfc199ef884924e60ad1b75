evm: enable key retention service automatically

If keys are not enabled, EVM is not visible in the configuration menu.
It may be difficult to figure out what to do unless you really know.
Other subsystems as NFS, CIFS select keys automatically. This patch does
the same.

This patch also removes '(TRUSTED_KEYS=y || TRUSTED_KEYS=n)' dependency,
which is unnecessary. EVM does not depend on trusted keys, but on
encrypted keys. evm.h provides compile time dependency.
