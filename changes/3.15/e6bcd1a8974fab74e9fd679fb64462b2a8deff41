x86/build: Supress "Nothing to be done for ..." messages

When we build an already built kernel again, arch/x86/syscalls/Makefile
and arch/x86/tools/Makefile emits "Nothing to be done for ..."
messages.

Here is the command log:

  $ make defconfig
     [ snip ]
  $ make
     [ snip ]
  $ make
  make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.            <-----
  make[1]: Nothing to be done for `relocs'.         <-----
    CHK     include/config/kernel.release
    CHK     include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h

Besides not emitting those, "all" and "relocs" should be added to PHONY as well.
