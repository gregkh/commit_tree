zram: move comp allocation out of init_lock

While fixing lockdep spew of ->init_lock reported by Sasha Levin [1],
Minchan Kim noted [2] that it's better to move compression backend
allocation (using GPF_KERNEL) out of the ->init_lock lock, same way as
with zram_meta_alloc(), in order to prevent the same lockdep spew.
