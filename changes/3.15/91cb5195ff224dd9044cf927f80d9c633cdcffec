checkpatch: expand parenthesis alignment test to declarations, functions and assignments

Currently the parenthesis alignment test works only on misalignments of
if statements like

	if (foo(bar,
			baz)

Expand the test to find misalignments like:

static inline int foo(int bar,
			int baz)

and

	foo(bar,
			baz);

and

	foo = bar(baz,
			qux);

Expand the $Inline keyword for __inline and __inline__ too.
Add $Inline to $Declare so it also matches "static inline <foo>".

These checks are only performed with --strict.
