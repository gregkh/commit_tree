staging: dgap: Fixed sparse error: same symbol redeclared with different type

sparse reported dgap_do_fep_load is redeclared with different type. while
fixing, I noticed __user attribute is used incorrectly in declaration.
There is no need to define __user for firware->data.

Replaced the __user with 'const uchar *' from function dgap_do_fep_load and
did the same for function dgap_do_bios_load
