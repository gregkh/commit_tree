net: filter: fix possible memory leak in __sk_prepare_filter()

__sk_prepare_filter() was reworked in commit bd4cf0ed3 (net: filter:
rework/optimize internal BPF interpreter's instruction set) so that it should
have uncharged memory once things went wrong. However that work isn't complete.
Error is handled only in __sk_migrate_filter() while memory can still leak in
the error path right after sk_chk_filter().
