powerpc/mm: Make sure a local_irq_disable prevent a parallel THP split

We have generic code like the one in get_futex_key that assume that
a local_irq_disable prevents a parallel THP split. Support that by
adding a dummy smp call function after setting _PAGE_SPLITTING. Code
paths like get_user_pages_fast still need to check for _PAGE_SPLITTING
after disabling IRQ which indicate that a parallel THP splitting is
ongoing. Now if they don't find _PAGE_SPLITTING set, then we can be
sure that parallel split will now block in pmdp_splitting flush
until we enables IRQ
