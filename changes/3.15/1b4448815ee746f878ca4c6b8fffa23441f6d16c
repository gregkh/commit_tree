Altera TSE: Fix DMA secriptor length initialization

sgdma_descrip is a function name as well as the name of a struct. In
sgdma_initialize(), we should initialize the descriptor length field
with the actual length of a descriptor not with the size of the
function. In order to prevent such things from happening in the future,
rename the function to sgdma_setup_descrip().
