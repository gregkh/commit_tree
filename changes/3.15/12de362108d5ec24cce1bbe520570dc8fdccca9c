rtc: mc13xxx: change RTC validation scheme

Datasheet says: "When the VSRTC voltage drops to the range of 0.9 - 0.8V,
the RTCPORB reset signal is generated and the contents of the RTC will
be reset.  <skip>.  To inform the processor that the contents of the RTC
are no longer valid due to the reset, a timer reset interrupt function
is implemented with the RTCRSTI bit." This patch makes the RTC valid by
default until RTCRST interrupt occurs.
