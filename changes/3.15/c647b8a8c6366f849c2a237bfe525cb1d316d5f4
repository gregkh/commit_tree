libceph: add support for CEPH_OSD_OP_SETALLOCHINT osd op

This is primarily for rbd's benefit and is supposed to combat
fragmentation:

"... knowing that rbd images have a 4m size, librbd can pass a hint
that will let the osd do the xfs allocation size ioctl on new files so
that they are allocated in 1m or 4m chunks.  We've seen cases where
users with rbd workloads have very high levels of fragmentation in xfs
and this would mitigate that and probably have a pretty nice
performance benefit."

SETALLOCHINT is considered advisory, so our backwards compatibility
mechanism here is to set FAILOK flag for all SETALLOCHINT ops.
