ASoC: wm8962: Update register CLASS_D_CONTROL_1 to be non-volatile

The register CLASS_D_CONTROL_1 is marked as volatile because it contains
a bit, DAC_MUTE, which is also mirrored in the ADC_DAC_CONTROL_1
register. This causes problems for the "Speaker Switch" control, which
will report an error if the CODEC is suspended because it relies on a
volatile register.

To resolve this issue mark CLASS_D_CONTROL_1 as non-volatile and
manually keep the register cache in sync by updating both bits when
changing the mute status.
