mfd: omap-usb-host: Get clocks based on hardware revision

Not all revisions have all the clocks so get the necessary clocks
based on hardware revision.

This should avoid un-necessary clk_get failure messages that were
observed earlier.

Also remove the dummy USB host clocks from the OMAP3 clock data.
These are no longer expected by the driver.
