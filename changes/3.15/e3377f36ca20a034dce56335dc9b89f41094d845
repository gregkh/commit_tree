xen-netback: Handle guests with too many frags

Xen network protocol had implicit dependency on MAX_SKB_FRAGS. Netback has to
handle guests sending up to XEN_NETBK_LEGACY_SLOTS_MAX slots. To achieve that:
- create a new skb
- map the leftover slots to its frags (no linear buffer here!)
- chain it to the previous through skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list
- map them
- copy and coalesce the frags into a brand new one and send it to the stack
- unmap the 2 old skb's pages

It's also introduces new stat counters, which help determine how often the guest
sends a packet with more than MAX_SKB_FRAGS frags.

NOTE: if bisect brought you here, you should apply the series up until
"xen-netback: Timeout packets in RX path", otherwise malicious guests can block
other guests by not releasing their sent packets.
