zram: use atomic64_t for all zram stats

This is a preparation patch for stats code duplication removal.

1) use atomic64_t for `pages_zero' and `pages_stored' zram stats.

2) `compr_size' and `pages_zero' struct zram_stats members did not
   follow the existing device attr naming scheme: zram_stats.ATTR has
   ATTR_show() function.  rename them:

   -- compr_size -> compr_data_size
   -- pages_zero -> zero_pages

Minchan Kim's note:
 If we really have trouble with atomic stat operation, we could
 change it with percpu_counter so that it could solve atomic overhead and
 unnecessary memory space by introducing unsigned long instead of 64bit
 atomic_t.
