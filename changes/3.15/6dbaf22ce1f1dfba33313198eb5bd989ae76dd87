mm: shmem: save one radix tree lookup when truncating swapped pages

Page cache radix tree slots are usually stabilized by the page lock, but
shmem's swap cookies have no such thing.  Because the overall truncation
loop is lockless, the swap entry is currently confirmed by a tree lookup
and then deleted by another tree lookup under the same tree lock region.

Use radix_tree_delete_item() instead, which does the verification and
deletion with only one lookup.  This also allows removing the
delete-only special case from shmem_radix_tree_replace().
