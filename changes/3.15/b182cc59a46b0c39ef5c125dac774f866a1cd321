drm/crtc-helper: fix locking for drm_helper_disable_unused_functions

We have two calling contexts for thise function:

- In the crtc helper code itself as part of the ->set_config
  implementation. In this calling context all modeset locks are
  already held, as they should.

- In drivers not implementing fastboot before the fbdev/fbcon setup
  and initialization. This has been added for all drivers in

      drm/fb-helper: don't disable everything in initial_config

  In this calling context we do not hold any modeset locks since the
  immediately following call to initialize the fbev emulation grabs
  all these locks themselves.

- There are two exceptions to the above rule: shmob doesn't have fbdev
  emulation support. I've manually checked the callchain up to the
  driver load function and no kms locks are held.

The right fix therefore is to split this helper into an internal and
external version and add the required locking to the function exported
to drivers.

This remedies locking inconsistencies exposed by me adding locking
WARNs as part of the recent kerneldoc abi polishing done in
