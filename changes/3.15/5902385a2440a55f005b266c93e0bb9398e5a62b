tipc: obsolete the remote management feature

Due to the lacking of any credential, it's allowed to accept commands
requested from remote nodes to query the local node status, which is
prone to involve potential security risks. Instead, if we login to
a remote node with ssh command, this approach is not only more safe
than the remote management feature, but also it can give us more
permissions like changing the remote node configuration. So it's
reasonable for us to obsolete the remote management feature now.
