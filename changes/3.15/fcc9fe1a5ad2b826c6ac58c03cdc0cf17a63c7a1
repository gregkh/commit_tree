drm/i915: restrict vt-d stolen memory workaround to pre-gen8

We want future generations to at least attempt to use all features, so
restrict the stolen memory disabling when vt-d is enabled to the
latest generation we have reports for. Which is a HSW per the original
report.

Also once we get a bit a hold of some of the mysterious framebuffer in
stolen memory issues that still haunt bugzilla, we should probably
drop this hack again and see what happens.
