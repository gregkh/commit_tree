rcutorture: Create CFcommon file for common Kconfig parameters

Currently, CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST=y is hardcoded into the
kvm-test-1-rcu.sh script and CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME=y is mentioned in each
and every configs file.  This commit creates a CFcommon file for these
two Kconfig parameters, and modifies kvm-test-1-rcu.sh to copy this new
file into the .config file during the build.  This change will allow
these scripts to operate on torture types other than just rcutorture.
