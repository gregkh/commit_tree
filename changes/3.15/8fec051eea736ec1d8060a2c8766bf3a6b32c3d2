cpufreq: Convert existing drivers to use cpufreq_freq_transition_{begin|end}

CPUFreq core has new infrastructure that would guarantee serialized calls to
target() or target_index() callbacks. These are called
cpufreq_freq_transition_begin() and cpufreq_freq_transition_end().

This patch converts existing drivers to use these new set of routines.
