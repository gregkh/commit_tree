rcutorture: Move common boot flags to kvm-test-1-rcu.sh

Currently, most boot flags are calculated in kvm-test-1-rcu.sh, except
that rcutorture.test_no_idle_hz and rcutorture.verbose are set up by
kvm.sh.  This commit promotes one-stop shopping by consolidating the
determination of boot flags into kvm-test-1-rcu.sh.
