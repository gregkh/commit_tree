mmc: sdhci-s3c: Fix handling of bus clock switching

Currently the driver assumes at probe that controller is configured for
last valid enumerated bus clock. This assumption is completely wrong, as
there is no way to ensure such configuration until the hardware gets
first configured (by calling sdhci_s3c_set_clock()).

This patch modifies the driver to set current clock at probe to unknown
state (represented by negative value) and make sure that the hardware
gets actually configured to selected clock in sdhci_s3c_set_clock().
