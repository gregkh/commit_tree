rtl8180: support for BSS_CHANGED_BASIC_RATES

Basic rates setting is done with hardcoded register write with
fixed settings.

This patch introduces a new function that makes it possible to
configure basic rates and it add a check for mac80211
BSS_CHANGED_BASIC_RATES flag in order to eventually invoke that
function when needed.
