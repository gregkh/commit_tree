PCI: Check all IORESOURCE_TYPE_BITS in pci_bus_alloc_from_region()

When allocating space from a bus resource, i.e., from apertures leading to
this bus, make sure the entire resource type matches.  The previous code
assumed the IORESOURCE_TYPE_BITS field was a bitmask with only a single bit
set, but this is not true.  IORESOURCE_TYPE_BITS is really an enumeration,
and we have to check all the bits.

See 72dcb1197228 ("resources: Add register address resource type").

No functional change.  If we used this path for allocating IRQs, DMA
channels, or bus numbers, this would fix a bug because those types are
indistinguishable when masked by IORESOURCE_IO | IORESOURCE_MEM.  But we
don't, so this shouldn't make any difference.
