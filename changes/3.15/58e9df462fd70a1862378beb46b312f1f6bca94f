brcmfmac: reinit watchdog completion after handling watchdog

The watchdog thread waits on completion that is set from a timer. As
the completion is count based this could mean that on a busy system
the watchdog is handled multiple times with a very short interval.
This is not the intended behaviour. After handling the watchdog it
should wait for the next timer expiry. This is accomplished by
reinitializing the completion.
