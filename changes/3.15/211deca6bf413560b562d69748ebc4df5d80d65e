s390/uaccess: consistent types

The types 'size_t' and 'unsigned long' have been used randomly for the
uaccess functions. This looks rather confusing.
So let's change all functions to use unsigned long instead and get rid
of size_t in order to have a consistent interface.

The only exception is strncpy_from_user() which uses 'long' since it
may return a signed value (-EFAULT).
