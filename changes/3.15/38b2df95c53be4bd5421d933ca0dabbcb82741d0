[media] drx-j: add a driver for Trident drx-j frontend

Add support for the Trident DRX-J driver, including a card profile for the
PCTV 80e which uses the chip.

Thanks to Trident for allowing the release of this code under a BSD license,
and of course Hauppauge/PCTV for pushing for its release to the community.

[pdickeybeta@gmail.com: modified to fix compilation errors and also to move
 the driver files from the drx39xy subdirectory to the frontends directory]

[m.chehab@samsung.com: fix merge conflicts, commented drx-j compilation and
 added EM28XX_R06_I2C_CLK setup also to the board setup]
