MIPS: Simplify PTRACE_PEEKUSR for FPC_EIR

All architecturally defined bits in the FPU implementation register
are read only & unchanging. It contains some implementation-defined
bits but the architecture manual states "This bits are explicitly not
intended to be used for mode control functions" which seems to provide
justification for viewing the register as a whole as unchanging. This
being the case we can simply re-use the value we read at boot rather
than having to re-read it later, and avoid the complexity which that
read entails.
