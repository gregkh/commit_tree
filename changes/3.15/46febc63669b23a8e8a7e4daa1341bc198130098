ARM: mvebu: change the default PCIe apertures for Armada 370/XP

The latest Marvell bootloaders for various boards change the MBus
Window base address from 0xC0000000 to 0xF0000000, in order to make
more RAM in the first 4 GB actually usable by the kernel (RAM that is
covered by the MBus window is "shadowed" and therefore not usable).

However, our default PCIe memory and I/O apertures where sitting at
0xe0000000 (for memory) and 0xe8000000 (for I/O), which will now be
outside of the MBus Window range on those platforms. To make things
work, we have to ensure those apertures use addresses in the
0xF0000000 -> 0xFFFFFFFF range.

Of course this change of the MBus Window base address from 0xC0000000
to 0xF0000000 also comes with a change of the internal register base
address from 0xD0000000 to 0xF1000000.

We have therefore designed the following memory map:

 * 0xF0000000 -> 0xF1000000: 16 MB, used for NOR flashes on Armada XP
   GP and Armada XP DB.

 * 0xF1000000 -> 0xF1100000: 1 MB, used for internal registers.

 * 0xF8000000 -> 0xFFE00000: 126 MB, used for PCIe memory.

 * 0xFFE00000 -> 0xFFF00000: 1 MB, used for PCIe I/O.

 * 0xFFF00000 -> 0xFFFFFFFF: 1 MB, used for the BootROM mapping

There is one exception to this layout: the Armada XP OpenBlocks, which
has a 128 MB NOR flash, mapped from 0xF0000000 to 0xF8000000. This
does not conflict with the current change for the PCIe I/O and memory
apertures, and continues to work because on Armada XP OpenBlocks, the
bootloader is an old one, and continues to have internal registers
mapped at 0xD0000000.
