Bluetooth: Fix triggering BR/EDR L2CAP Connect too early

Commit 1c2e004183178 introduced an event handler for the encryption key
refresh complete event with the intent of fixing some LE/SMP cases.
However, this event is shared with BR/EDR and there we actually want to
act only on the auth_complete event (which comes after the key refresh).

If we do not do this we may trigger an L2CAP Connect Request too early
and cause the remote side to return a security block error.
