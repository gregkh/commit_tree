ARM: imx: add suspend in ocram support for i.mx6q

When system enter suspend, we can set the DDR IO to
high-Z state to save DDR IOs' power consumption, this
operation can save many power(from ~26mA@1.5V to ~15mA@1.5V,
measured on i.MX6Q SabreSD board, R25) of DDR IOs. To
achieve that, we need to copy the suspend code to ocram
and run the low level hardware related code(set DDR IOs
to high-Z state) in ocram.

If there is no ocram space available, then system will
still do suspend in external DDR, hence no DDR IOs will
be set to high-Z.

The OCRAM usage layout is as below,
