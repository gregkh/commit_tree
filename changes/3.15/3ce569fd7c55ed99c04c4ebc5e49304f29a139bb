[media] v4l: add RF tuner channel bandwidth control

Modern silicon RF tuners has one or more adjustable filters on
signal path, in order to filter noise from desired radio channel.

Add channel bandwidth control to tell the driver which is radio
channel width we want receive. Filters could be then adjusted by
the driver or hardware, using RF frequency and channel bandwidth
as a base of filter calculations.

On automatic mode (normal mode), bandwidth is calculated from sampling
rate or tuning info got from userspace. That new control gives
possibility to set manual mode and let user have more control for
filters.
