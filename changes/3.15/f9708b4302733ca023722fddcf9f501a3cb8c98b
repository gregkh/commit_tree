consolidate duplicate code is skb_checksum_setup() helpers

Realizing that the skb_maybe_pull_tail() calls in the IP-protocol
specific portions of both helpers are terminal ones (i.e. no further
pulls are expected), their maximum size to be pulled can be made match
their minimal size needed, thus making the code identical and hence
possible to be moved into another helper.
