mac80211: fix suspend vs. authentication race

Since Stanislaw's patch removing the quiescing code, mac80211 had
a race regarding suspend vs. authentication: as cfg80211 doesn't
track authentication attempts, it can't abort them. Therefore the
attempts may be kept running while suspending, which can lead to
all kinds of issues, in at least some cases causing an error in
iwlmvm firmware.

Fix this by aborting the authentication attempt when suspending.
