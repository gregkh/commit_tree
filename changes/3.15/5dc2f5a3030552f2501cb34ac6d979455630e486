cpuidle: rename expected_us to next_timer_us in menu governor

The field expected_us is used to store the time remaining until next
timer expiry. The name is inaccurate, as we really do not expect all
wakeups to be caused by timers. In addition, another field with a very
similar name (predicted_us) is used to store the predicted time
remaining until any wakeup source being active.

This patch renames expected_us to next_timer_us in order to better
reflect the contained information.
