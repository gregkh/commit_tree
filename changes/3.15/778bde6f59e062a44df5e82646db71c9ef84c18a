ALSA: hda - Rename reg access ops in hda_controller_ops

Using readl, writel, etc. resulted in some architectures, such as
s390, expanding the member names into zpci_writel.  Obviously not the
intended result.

Fixes s390 build breakage introduced by "4083081 - ALSA: hda - Allow
different ops to read/write registers"
