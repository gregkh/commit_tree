cgroup: rename cgroup_dummy_root and related names

The dummy root will be repurposed to serve as the default unified
hierarchy.  Let's rename things in preparation.

* s/cgroup_dummy_root/cgrp_dfl_root/
* s/cgroupfs_root/cgroup_root/ as we don't do fs part directly anymore
* s/cgroup_root->top_cgroup/cgroup_root->cgrp/ for brevity

This is pure rename.
