ARM: at91: split out at91x40 into a top-level option

at91x40 is different from all the other at91 machines, and it is
impossible to build a kernel that works on both this SoC and
any of the others, even though it is possible to build a noMMU
kernel for any at91 machine.

By turning at91x40 into a separate top-level option, we explicitly
forbid enabling invalid configurations that include mutually exclusive
machines.
