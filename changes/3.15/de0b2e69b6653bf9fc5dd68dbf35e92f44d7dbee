drivers: block: Move prototype declaration to appropriate header file from drbd_main.c

Move prototype declaration of functions drbdd_init() and drbd_asender()
from drbd/drbd_main.c to header file drbd/drbd_int.h because these
functions are used by more than one file.

This eliminates the following warning in drbd/drbd_receiver.c:
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_receiver.c:4836:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘drbdd_init’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_receiver.c:5245:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘drbd_asender’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
