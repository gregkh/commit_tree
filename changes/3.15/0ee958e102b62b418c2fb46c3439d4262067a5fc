MIPS: Coherent Processing System SMP implementation

This patch introduces a new SMP implementation for systems implementing
the MIPS Coherent Processing System architecture. The kernel will make
use of the Coherence Manager, Cluster Power Controller & Global
Interrupt Controller in order to detect, bring up & make use of other
cores in the system. SMTC is not supported, so only a single TC per VPE
in the system is used. That is, this option enables an SMVP style setup
but across multiple cores.
