remoteproc/davinci: drop needless devm_clk_put

The comment above disable_irq says that it is needed to ensure that the
"devm subsystem might end up releasing things before freeing the irq,
thus allowing an interrupt to sneak in while the device is being
removed." disable_irq is enough for this purpose and there is no need to
manually free the reference to the clock.
