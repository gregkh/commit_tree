net: replace __this_cpu_inc in route.c with raw_cpu_inc

The RT_CACHE_STAT_INC macro triggers the new preemption checks
for __this_cpu ops.

I do not see any other synchronization that would allow the use of a
__this_cpu operation here however in commit dbd2915ce87e ("[IPV4]:
RT_CACHE_STAT_INC() warning fix") Andrew justifies the use of
raw_smp_processor_id() here because "we do not care" about races.  In
the past we agreed that the price of disabling interrupts here to get
consistent counters would be too high.  These counters may be inaccurate
due to race conditions.

The use of __this_cpu op improves the situation already from what commit
dbd2915ce87e did since the single instruction emitted on x86 does not
allow the race to occur anymore.  However, non x86 platforms could still
experience a race here.
