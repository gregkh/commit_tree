GFS2: journal data writepages update

GFS2 has carried what is more or less a copy of the
write_cache_pages() for some time. It seems that this
copy has slipped behind the core code over time. This
patch brings it back uptodate, and in addition adds the
tracepoint which would otherwise be missing.

We could go further, and eliminate some or all of the
code duplication here. The issue is that if we do that,
then the function we need to split out from the existing
write_cache_pages(), which will look a lot like
gfs2_jdata_write_pagevec(), would land up putting quite a
lot of extra variables on the stack. I know that has been
a problem in the past in the writeback code path, which
is why I've hesitated to do it here.
