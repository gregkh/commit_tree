wlcore: memset wl->rx_filter_enabled to zero after recovery

zero rx_filter_enabled array after recovery to avoid
cases were the driver will keep trying to clear a
filter which is not configured in FW.

Such case will cause consecutive recoveries due to
command execution failures.

While on it, convert rx_filter_enabled to bitmap,
to save some memory and make sparse happy (it
doesn't like sizeof(bool array)).
