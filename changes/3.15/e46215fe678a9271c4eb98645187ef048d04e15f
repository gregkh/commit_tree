Revert "Revert "Staging: rtl8812ae: remove modules field of rate_control_ops""

This reverts commit 161d7855543520cde5f49df788b0ea0553a9f83a.

Reversal of fortune -- I thought this was going to be resolved by other
means, but that hasn't materialized.  Plus, apparently we now care more
than I realized about not breaking staging drivers...
