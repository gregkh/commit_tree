cpufreq: powernv: cpufreq driver for powernv platform

Backend driver to dynamically set voltage and frequency on
IBM POWER non-virtualized platforms.  Power management SPRs
are used to set the required PState.

This driver works in conjunction with cpufreq governors
like 'ondemand' to provide a demand based frequency and
voltage setting on IBM POWER non-virtualized platforms.

PState table is obtained from OPAL v3 firmware through device
tree.

powernv_cpufreq back-end driver would parse the relevant device-tree
nodes and initialise the cpufreq subsystem on powernv platform.

The code was originally written by svaidy@linux.vnet.ibm.com. Over
time it was modified to accomodate bug-fixes as well as updates to the
the cpu-freq core. Relevant portions of the change logs corresponding
to those modifications are noted below:

 * The policy->cpus needs to be populated in a hotplug-invariant
   manner instead of using cpu_sibling_mask() which varies with
   cpu-hotplug. This is because the cpufreq core code copies this
   content into policy->related_cpus mask which should not vary on
   cpu-hotplug. [Authored by srivatsa.bhat@linux.vnet.ibm.com]

 * Create a helper routine that can return the cpu-frequency for the
   corresponding pstate_id. Also, cache the values of the pstate_max,
   pstate_min and pstate_nominal and nr_pstates in a static structure
   so that they can be reused in the future to perform any
   validations. [Authored by ego@linux.vnet.ibm.com]

 * Create a driver attribute named cpuinfo_nominal_freq which creates
   a sysfs read-only file named cpuinfo_nominal_freq. Export the
   frequency corresponding to the nominal_pstate through this
   interface.

     Nominal frequency is the highest non-turbo frequency for the
   platform.  This is generally used for setting governor policies
   from user space for optimal energy efficiency. [Authored by
   ego@linux.vnet.ibm.com]

 * Implement a powernv_cpufreq_get(unsigned int cpu) method which will
   return the current operating frequency. Export this via the sysfs
   interface cpuinfo_cur_freq by setting powernv_cpufreq_driver.get to
   powernv_cpufreq_get(). [Authored by ego@linux.vnet.ibm.com]
