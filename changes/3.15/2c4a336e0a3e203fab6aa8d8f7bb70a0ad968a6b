vsock: Make transport the proto owner

Right now the core vsock module is the owner of the proto family. This
means there's nothing preventing the transport module from unloading if
there are open sockets, which results in a panic. Fix that by allowing
the transport to be the owner, which will refcount it properly.

Includes version bump to 1.0.1.0-k

Passes checkpatch this time, I swear...
