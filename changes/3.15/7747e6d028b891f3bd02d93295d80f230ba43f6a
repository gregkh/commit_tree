jbd2: mark file-local functions as static

Mark functions as static in jbd2/journal.c because they are not used
outside this file.

This eliminates the following warning in jbd2/journal.c:
fs/jbd2/journal.c:125:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘jbd2_verify_csum_type’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
fs/jbd2/journal.c:146:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘jbd2_superblock_csum_verify’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
fs/jbd2/journal.c:154:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘jbd2_superblock_csum_set’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
