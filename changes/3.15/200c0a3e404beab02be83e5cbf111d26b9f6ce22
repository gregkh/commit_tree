Power: Reset: Generalize qnap-poweroff to work on Synology devices.

The Synology NAS devices use a very similar mechanism to QNAP NAS
devices to power off. Both send a single charactor command to a PIC,
over the second serial port. However the baud rate and the command
differ. Generalize the driver to support this.
