integrity: fix checkpatch errors

Between checkpatch changes (eg. sizeof) and inconsistencies between
Lindent and checkpatch, unfixed checkpatch errors make it difficult
to see new errors. This patch fixes them. Some lines with over 80 chars
remained unchanged to improve code readability.

The "extern" keyword is removed from internal evm.h to make it consistent
with internal ima.h.
