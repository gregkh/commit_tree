Btrfs: unlock extent and pages on error in cow_file_range

When I converted the BUG_ON() for the free_space_cache_inode in cow_file_range I
made it so we just return an error instead of unlocking all of our various
stuff.  This is a mistake and causes us to hang when we run into this.  This
patch fixes this problem.  Thanks,
