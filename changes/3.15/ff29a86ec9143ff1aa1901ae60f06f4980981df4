ixgbe: never generate both software and hardware timestamps

skb_tx_timestamp() does not report software time stamp
if SKBTX_IN_PROGRESS is set. According to timestamping.txt
software time stamps are a fallback and should not be
generated if hardware time stamp is provided.

Move call to skb_tx_timestamp() after setting
SKBTX_IN_PROGRESS.
