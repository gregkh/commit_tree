[media] vb2: call buf_finish from __queue_cancel

If a queue was canceled, then the buf_finish op was never called for the
pending buffers. So add this call to queue_cancel. Before calling buf_finish
set the buffer state to PREPARED, which is the correct state. That way the
states DONE and ERROR will only be seen in buf_finish if streaming is in
progress.

Since buf_finish can now be called from non-streaming state we need to
adapt the handful of drivers that actually need to know this.
