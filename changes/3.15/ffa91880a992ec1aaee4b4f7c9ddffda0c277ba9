perf tools: Improve error reporting

In the current version, when using perf record, if something goes
wrong in tools/perf/builtin-record.c:375
  session = perf_session__new(file, false, NULL);

The error message:
"Not enough memory for reading per file header"

is issued. This error message seems to be outdated and is not very
helpful. This patch proposes to replace this error message by
"Perf session creation failed"

I believe this issue has been brought to lkml:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/2/24/458
although this patch only tackles a (small) part of the issue.

Additionnaly, this patch improves error reporting in
tools/perf/util/data.c open_file_write.

Currently, if the call to open fails, the user is unaware of it.
This patch logs the error, before returning the error code to
the caller.
