md: always set MD_RECOVERY_INTR when aborting a reshape or other "resync".

If mddev->ro is set, md_to_sync will (correctly) abort.
However in that case MD_RECOVERY_INTR isn't set.

If a RESHAPE had been requested, then ->finish_reshape() will be
called and it will think the reshape was successful even though
nothing happened.

Normally a resync will not be requested if ->ro is set, but if an
array is stopped while a reshape is on-going, then when the array is
started, the reshape will be restarted.  If the array is also set
read-only at this point, the reshape will instantly appear to success,
resulting in data corruption.

Consequently, this patch is suitable for any -stable kernel.
