mm/memory.c: mark functions as static

mark functions as static in memory.c because they are not used outside
this file.

This eliminates the following warnings in mm/memory.c:

  mm/memory.c:3530:5: warning: no previous prototype for `numa_migrate_prep' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
  mm/memory.c:3545:5: warning: no previous prototype for `do_numa_page' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
