imx-drm: imx-tve: correct DDC property name to 'ddc-i2c-bus'

Commit 62e3879 (imx-drm: imx-tve: Fix DDC I2C bus property) was trying
to use 'ddc-i2c-bus' as the DDC property name (we can see that from the
commit log), but unfortunately 'i2c-ddc-bus' which is a typo was
actually used in the code.  This results in some unnecessary
inconsistency and confusions, because all the documented DDC property
in device tree bindings use 'ddc-i2c-bus'.

  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/staging/imx-drm/hdmi.txt
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/panel/simple-panel.txt
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/dvi-connector.txt

Let's fix it before the error spreads.
