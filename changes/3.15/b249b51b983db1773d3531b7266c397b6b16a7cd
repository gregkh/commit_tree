netpoll: move setting of NETPOLL_RX_DROP into netpoll_poll_dev

Today netpoll depends on setting NETPOLL_RX_DROP before networking
drivers receive packets in interrupt context so that the packets can
be dropped.  Move this setting into netpoll_poll_dev from
poll_one_napi so that if ndo_poll_controller happens to receive
packets we will drop the packets on the floor instead of letting the
packets bounce through the networking stack and potentially cause problems.
