cgroup: drop module support

With module supported dropped from net_prio, no controller is using
cgroup module support.  None of actual resource controllers can be
built as a module and we aren't gonna add new controllers which don't
control resources.  This patch drops module support from cgroup.

* cgroup_[un]load_subsys() and cgroup_subsys->module removed.

* As there's no point in distinguishing IS_BUILTIN() and IS_MODULE(),
  cgroup_subsys.h now uses IS_ENABLED() directly.

* enum cgroup_subsys_id now exactly matches the list of enabled
  controllers as ordered in cgroup_subsys.h.

* cgroup_subsys[] is now a contiguously occupied array.  Size
  specification is no longer necessary and dropped.

* for_each_builtin_subsys() is removed and for_each_subsys() is
  updated to not require any locking.

* module ref handling is removed from rebind_subsystems().

* Module related comments dropped.

v2: Rebased on top of fe1217c4f3f7 ("net: net_cls: move cgroupfs
    classid handling into core").

v3: Added {} around the if (need_forkexit_callback) block in
    cgroup_post_fork() for readability as suggested by Li.
