ftrace: Allow instances to use function tracing

Allow instances (sub-buffers) to enable function tracing.
Each instance will have its own function tracing capability.
For now, instances will not have function stack tracing, or will
they be able to pick and choose what functions they can trace.

Picking and choosing their own functions will come later.
