mm: add !pte_present() check on existing hugetlb_entry callbacks

The age table walker doesn't check non-present hugetlb entry in common
path, so hugetlb_entry() callbacks must check it.  The reason for this
behavior is that some callers want to handle it in its own way.

[ I think that reason is bogus, btw - it should just do what the regular
  code does, which is to call the "pte_hole()" function for such hugetlb
  entries  - Linus]

However, some callers don't check it now, which causes unpredictable
result, for example when we have a race between migrating hugepage and
reading /proc/pid/numa_maps.  This patch fixes it by adding !pte_present
checks on buggy callbacks.

This bug exists for years and got visible by introducing hugepage
migration.

ChangeLog v2:
- fix if condition (check !pte_present() instead of pte_present())
