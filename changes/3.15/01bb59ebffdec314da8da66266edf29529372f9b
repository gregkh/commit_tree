usb/xhci: fix compilation warning when !CONFIG_PCI && !CONFIG_PM

When CONFIG_PCI and CONFIG_PM are not selected, xhci.c gets this
warning:
drivers/usb/host/xhci.c:409:13: warning: ‘xhci_msix_sync_irqs’ defined
but not used [-Wunused-function]

Instead of creating nested #ifdefs, this patch fixes it by defining the
xHCI PCI stubs as inline.

This warning has been in since 3.2 kernel and was
caused by commit 421aa841a134f6a743111cf44d0c6d3b45e3cf8c
"usb/xhci: hide MSI code behind PCI bars", but wasn't noticed
until 3.13 when a configuration with these options was tried
