be2net: refactor multi-channel config code for Skyhawk-R chip

Currently multi-channel configuration is read via the QUERY_FW_CONFIG cmd.
This method has been deprecated by the Skyhawk-R FW. Instead,
GET_PROFILE_CONFIG::port-desc must be used to query this configuration.

This patch also:
a) introduces a few macros to identify certain categories of multi-channel
configs
2) re-factors the be_cmd_set_profile_config() code to be able to read any kind
of desc (and not just the nic-desc.)
