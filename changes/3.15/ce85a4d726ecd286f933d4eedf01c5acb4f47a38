ASoC: dapm: Fix SUSPEND -> OFF bias sequence

Currently when the DAPM context bias level is SUSPEND and the target bias level
is OFF dapm_pre_sequence_async() will first transition to PREPARE and
dapm_post_sequence_async() will then transition back from PREPARE to STANDBY and
then to OFF.

This patch makes sure that dapm_pre_sequence_async() only transitions to PREPARE
when either going to ON or away from ON. This avoids the extra unnecessary
transitions.
