crypto: crypto_wq - Fix late crypto work queue initialization

The crypto algorithm modules utilizing the crypto daemon could
be used early when the system start up.  Using module_init
does not guarantee that the daemon's work queue is initialized
when the cypto alorithm depending on crypto_wq starts.  It is necessary
to initialize the crypto work queue earlier at the subsystem
init time to make sure that it is initialized
when used.
