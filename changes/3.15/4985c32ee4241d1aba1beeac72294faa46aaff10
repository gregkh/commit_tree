ACPI / processor: Fix failure of loading acpi-cpufreq driver

According commit d640113fe (ACPI: processor: fix acpi_get_cpuid for UP
processor),  BIOS may not provide _MAT or MADT tables and acpi_get_apicid()
always returns -1. For these cases, original code will pass apic_id with
vaule of -1 to acpi_map_cpuid() and it will check the acpi_id. If acpi_id
is equal to zero, ignores apic_id and return zero for CPU0.

Commit b981513 (ACPI / scan: bail out early if failed to parse APIC
ID for CPU) changed the behavior. Return ENODEV when find apic_id is
less than zero after calling acpi_get_apicid(). This causes acpi-cpufreq
driver fails to be loaded on some machines. This patch is to fix it.
