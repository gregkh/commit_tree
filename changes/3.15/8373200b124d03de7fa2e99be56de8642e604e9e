fuse: Trust kernel i_size only

Make fuse think that when writeback is on the inode's i_size is always
up-to-date and not update it with the value received from the userspace.
This is done because the page cache code may update i_size without letting
the FS know.

This assumption implies fixing the previously introduced short-read helper --
when a short read occurs the 'hole' is filled with zeroes.

fuse_file_fallocate() is also fixed because now we should keep i_size up to
date, so it must be updated if FUSE_FALLOCATE request succeeded.
