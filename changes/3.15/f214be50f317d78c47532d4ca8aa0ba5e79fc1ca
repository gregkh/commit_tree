clocksource: marco: Fix the affinity set for local timer of CPU1

irqchip will reject the affinity set to CPUs which is not online
yet. but in the CPU1 wakeup stage, OS only sets CPU1 to be online
after local timer is set, so that causes the irq_set_affinity not
work. this patch moves to irq_force_affinity() for the low level
boot stage.
