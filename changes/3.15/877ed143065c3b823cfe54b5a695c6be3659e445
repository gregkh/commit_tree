[media] Prefer gspca_sonixb over sn9c102 for all devices

The sn9c102 driver is deprecated. It was moved to staging in
anticipation of its removal in a future kernel version. However, USB
devices 0C45:6024 and 0C45:6025 are still handled by sn9c102 when
both sn9c102 and gspca_sonixb are enabled.

We must migrate all the users of these devices to the gspca_sonixb
driver now, so that it gets sufficient testing before the sn9c102
driver is finally phased out.
