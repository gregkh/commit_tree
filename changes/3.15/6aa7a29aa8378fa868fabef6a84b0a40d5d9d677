initramfs: debug detected compression method

This can greatly aid in narrowing down the real source of initramfs
problems such as failures related to the compression of the in-kernel
initramfs when an external initramfs is in use as well.  Existing errors
are ambiguous as to which initramfs is a problem and why.
