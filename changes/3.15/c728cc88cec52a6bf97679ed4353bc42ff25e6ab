isdn: hisax/elsa: fix sleep_on race in elsa FSM

The state machine code in the elsa driver uses interruptible_sleep_on
to wait for state changes, which is racy. A closer look at the possible
states reveals that it is always used to wait for getting back into
ARCOFI_NOP, so we can use wait_event_interruptible instead.
