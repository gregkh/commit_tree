sched/wait: Suppress Sparse 'variable shadowing' warning

This warning seems to show up a lot now, since ___wait_event()
is (indirectly) used inside wait_event_timeout(), which also
has a variable called __ret. Rename the one in ___wait_event()
to ___ret (another leading underscore) to suppress the warning.
