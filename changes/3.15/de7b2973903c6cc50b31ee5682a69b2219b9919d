tracepoint: Use struct pointer instead of name hash for reg/unreg tracepoints

Register/unregister tracepoint probes with struct tracepoint pointer
rather than tracepoint name.

This change, which vastly simplifies tracepoint.c, has been proposed by
Steven Rostedt. It also removes 8.8kB (mostly of text) to the vmlinux
size.

From this point on, the tracers need to pass a struct tracepoint pointer
to probe register/unregister. A probe can now only be connected to a
tracepoint that exists. Moreover, tracers are responsible for
unregistering the probe before the module containing its associated
tracepoint is unloaded.
