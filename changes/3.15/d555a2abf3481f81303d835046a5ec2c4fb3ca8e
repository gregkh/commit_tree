[SCSI] Fix spurious request sense in error handling

We unconditionally execute scsi_eh_get_sense() to make sure all failed
commands that should have sense attached, do.  However, the routine forgets
that some commands, because of the way they fail, will not have any sense code
... we should not bother them with a REQUEST_SENSE command.  Fix this by
testing to see if we actually got a CHECK_CONDITION return and skip asking for
sense if we don't.
