mm: Add new func _install_special_mapping() to mmap.c

The _install_special_mapping() is the new base function for
install_special_mapping(). This function will return a pointer of the
created VMA or a error code in an ERR_PTR()

This new function will be needed by the for the vdso 32 bit support to map the
additonal vvar and hpet pages into the 32 bit address space. This will be done
with io_remap_pfn_range() and remap_pfn_range, which requieres a vm_area_struct.
