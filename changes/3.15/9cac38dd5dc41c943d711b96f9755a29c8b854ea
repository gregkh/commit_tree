KVM/s390: Set preempted flag during vcpu wakeup and interrupt delivery

Commit "kvm: Record the preemption status of vcpus using preempt notifiers"
caused a performance regression on s390. It turned out that in the case that
if a former sleeping cpu, that was woken up, this cpu is not a yield candidate
since it gave up the cpu voluntarily. To retain this candiate its preempted
flag is set during wakeup and interrupt delivery time.

Significant performance measurement work and code analysis to solve this
issue was provided by Mao Chuan Li and his team in Beijing.
