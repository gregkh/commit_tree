dmaengine: dw: went back to plain {request,free}_irq() calls

The commit dbde5c29 "dw_dmac: use devm_* functions to simplify code" turns
probe function to use devm_* helpers and simultaneously brings a regression. We
need to ensure irq is disabled, followed by ensuring that don't schedule any
more tasklets and then its safe to use tasklet_kill().

The free_irq() will ensure that the irq is disabled and also wait till all
scheduled interrupts are executed by invoking synchronize_irq(). So we need to
only do tasklet_kill() after invoking free_irq().
