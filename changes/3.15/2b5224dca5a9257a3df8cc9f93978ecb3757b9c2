Bluetooth: Store current RPA and update it if needed

The RPA needs to be stored to know which is the current one. Otherwise
it is impossible to ensure that always the correct RPA can be programmed
into the controller when it is needed.

Current code checks if the address in the controller is a RPA, but that
can potentially lead to using a RPA that can not be resolved with the
IRK that has been distributed.
