Btrfs: cache extent states in defrag code path

When locking file ranges in the inode's io_tree, cache the first
extent state that belongs to the target range, so that when unlocking
the range we don't need to search in the io_tree again, reducing cpu
time and making and therefore holding the io_tree's lock for a shorter
period.
