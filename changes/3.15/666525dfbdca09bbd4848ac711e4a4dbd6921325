ext4: fix 64-bit number truncation warning

'0x7FDEADBEEF' will be truncated to 32-bit number under unicore32. Need
append 'ULL' for it.

The related warning (with allmodconfig under unicore32):

    CC [M]  fs/ext4/extents_status.o
  fs/ext4/extents_status.c: In function "__es_remove_extent":
  fs/ext4/extents_status.c:813: warning: integer constant is too large for "long" type
