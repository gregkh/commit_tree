net: ppp: use sk_unattached_filter api

For the ppp driver, there are currently two open-coded BPF filters in use,
that is, pass_filter and active_filter. Migrate both to make proper use
of sk_unattached_filter_{create,destroy} API so that the actual BPF code
is decoupled from direct access, and filters can be jited as a side-effect
by the internal filter compiler.

Joint work with Alexei Starovoitov.
