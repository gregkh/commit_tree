rcutorture: Introduce "rcu" directory level underneath configs

This commit uses the standard software ploy of introducing another
level of indirection below the configs directory.  This allows each
torture-test suite to have its own set of Kconfig files, boot parameters,
and version-specific scripts.  Initially, we have only rcu, but lock
will follow soonish.
