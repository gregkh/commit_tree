x86: Load the 32-bit vdso in place, just like the 64-bit vdsos

This replaces a decent amount of incomprehensible and buggy code
with much more straightforward code.  It also brings the 32-bit vdso
more in line with the 64-bit vdsos, so maybe someday they can share
even more code.

This wastes a small amount of kernel .data and .text space, but it
avoids a couple of allocations on startup, so it should be more or
less a wash memory-wise.
