drm/i915: Permit contexts on all rings

If we want to use contexts in more abstract terms (specifically with
PPGTT in mind), we need to allow them to be specified for any ring.

Since the upcoming patches will bring about the use of multiple address
spaces, and each ring needs to have an address space programmed (which
we intend to do at context switch time), we can no longer only use RCS.

With multiple rings having a last context, we must now unreference these
contexts.

NOTE: This commit requires an update to intel-gpu-tools to make it not
fail.

v2: Rebased with some logical conflicts.
Squashed in the context fini refcount patch
