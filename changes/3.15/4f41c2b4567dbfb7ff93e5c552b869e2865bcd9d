s390/uaccess: get rid of indirect function calls

There are only two uaccess variants on s390 left: the version that is used
if the mvcos instruction is available, and the page table walk variant.
So there is no need for expensive indirect function calls.

By default the mvcos variant will be called. If the mvcos instruction is not
available it will call the page table walk variant.

For minimal performance impact the "if (mvcos_is_available)" is implemented
with a jump label, which will be a six byte nop on machines with mvcos.
