Revert "MIPS: MT: proc: Add support for printing VPE and TC ids"

Reverts commit 795038a6910937fa167d47f6f6183db0eb8fb706 because
d6d3c9afaab47418ab2d7f874fb8aeac1f067104 provides the same functionality
in a more generic way.  Both patches applied however means that the
VPE and TC IDs get printed twice currently.
