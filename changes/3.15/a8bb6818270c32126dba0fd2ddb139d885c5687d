drm/i915: Fix error path leak in fbdev fb allocation

In Jesse's patch to switch the fbdev framebuffer from an embedded
struct to a pointer the kfree in case of an error was missed. Fix this
up by using our own internal fb allocation helper directly instead of
reinventing that wheel.

We need a to_intel_framebuffer cast unfortunately since all the other
callers of _create still look better whith using a drm_framebuffer as
return pointer.

v2: Add an unlocked __intel_framebuffer_create function since our
dev->struct_mutex locking is too much a mess. With ppgtt we even need
it to take a look at the global gtt offset of pinned objects, since
the vma list might chance from underneath us. At least with the
current global gtt lookup functions. Reported by Mika.
