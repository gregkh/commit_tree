Btrfs: limit the path size in send to PATH_MAX

fs_path_ensure_buf is used to make sure our path buffers for
send are big enough for the path names as we construct them.
The buffer size is limited to 32K by the length field in
the struct.

But bugs in the path construction can end up trying to build
a huge buffer, and we'll do invalid memmmoves when the
buffer length field wraps.

This patch is step one, preventing the overflows.
