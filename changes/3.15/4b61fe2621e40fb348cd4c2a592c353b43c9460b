smc91x: Call dev_kfree/consume_skb_any instead of dev_kfree_skb.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in
smc_hardware_send_pkt that can be called in hard irq and other
contexts, and handles successfully transmitted packets.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_kfree_skb_any in smc_hard_start_xmit which
can be called in hard irq and other contexts, and only frees skbs
when dropping them.
