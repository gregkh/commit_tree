ipv4: add a sock pointer to ip_queue_xmit()

ip_queue_xmit() assumes the skb it has to transmit is attached to an
inet socket. Commit 31c70d5956fc ("l2tp: keep original skb ownership")
changed l2tp to not change skb ownership and thus broke this assumption.

One fix is to add a new 'struct sock *sk' parameter to ip_queue_xmit(),
so that we do not assume skb->sk points to the socket used by l2tp
tunnel.
