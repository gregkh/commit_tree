drivers: block: Mark the function as static in drbd_worker.c

Mark functions drbd_endio_read_sec_final(), drbd_send_barrier(),
need_to_send_barrier(), dequeue_work_batch(), dequeue_work_item() and
wait_for_work() as static in drbd/drbd_worker.c because they are not
used outside this file.

This eliminates the following warnings in drbd/drbd_worker.c:
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_worker.c:99:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘drbd_endio_read_sec_final’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
