Target/iscsi: Add T10-PI indication for iscsi_portal_group

In case an iscsi portal group will be defined as t10_pi enabled,
all connections on top of it will support protected transactions.

T10-PI support may require extra reource allocation and maintenance by
the transport layer, so we don't want to apply them on non-t10_pi network
portals. This is a hook for the iscsi target layer to signal the transport
at connection establishment that this connection will carry protected
transactions.
