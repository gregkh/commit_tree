kernfs: fix a subdir count leak

Currently kernfs_link_sibling() increates parent->dir.subdirs before
adding the node into parent's chidren rb tree.

Because it is possible that kernfs_link_sibling() couldn't find
a suitable slot and bail out, this leads to a mismatch between
elevated subdir count with actual children node numbers.

This patches fix this problem, by moving the subdir accouting
after the actual addtion happening.
