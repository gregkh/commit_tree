ipv4: yet another new IP_MTU_DISCOVER option IP_PMTUDISC_OMIT

IP_PMTUDISC_INTERFACE has a design error: because it does not allow the
generation of fragments if the interface mtu is exceeded, it is very
hard to make use of this option in already deployed name server software
for which I introduced this option.

This patch adds yet another new IP_MTU_DISCOVER option to not honor any
path mtu information and not accepting new icmp notifications destined for
the socket this option is enabled on. But we allow outgoing fragmentation
in case the packet size exceeds the outgoing interface mtu.

As such this new option can be used as a drop-in replacement for
IP_PMTUDISC_DONT, which is currently in use by most name server software
making the adoption of this option very smooth and easy.

The original advantage of IP_PMTUDISC_INTERFACE is still maintained:
ignoring incoming path MTU updates and not honoring discovered path MTUs
in the output path.
