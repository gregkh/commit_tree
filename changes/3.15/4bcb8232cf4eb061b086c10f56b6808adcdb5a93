exit: move check_stack_usage() to the end of do_exit()

It is not clear why check_stack_usage() is called so early and thus it
never checks the stack usage in, say, exit_notify() or
flush_ptrace_hw_breakpoint() or other functions which are only called by
do_exit().

Move the callsite down to the last preempt_disable/schedule.
