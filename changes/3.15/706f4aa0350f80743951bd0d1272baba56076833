QE: split function mpc85xx_qe_init() into two functions.

New QE doesn't have par_io, it doesn't need to init par_io
for new QE.
Split function mpc85xx_qe_init() into mpc85xx_qe_init()
and mpc85xx_qe_par_io_init().
Call mpc85xx_qe_init() for both new and old while
mpc85xx_qe_par_io_init() after mpc85xx_qe_init() for old.
