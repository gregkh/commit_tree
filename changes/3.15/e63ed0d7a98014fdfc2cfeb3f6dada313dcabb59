[SCSI] fix our current target reap infrastructure

This patch eliminates the reap_ref and replaces it with a proper kref.
On last put of this kref, the target is removed from visibility in
sysfs.  The final call to scsi_target_reap() for the device is done from
__scsi_remove_device() and only if the device was made visible.  This
ensures that the target disappears as soon as the last device is gone
rather than waiting until final release of the device (which is often
too long).
