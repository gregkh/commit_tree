mm: filemap: update find_get_pages_tag() to deal with shadow entries

Dave Jones reports the following crash when find_get_pages_tag() runs
into an exceptional entry:

  kernel BUG at mm/filemap.c:1347!

After commit 0cd6144aadd2 ("mm + fs: prepare for non-page entries in
page cache radix trees") this comment and BUG() are out of date because
exceptional entries can now appear in all mappings - as shadows of
recently evicted pages.

However, as Hugh Dickins notes,

  "it is truly surprising for a PAGECACHE_TAG_WRITEBACK (and probably
   any other PAGECACHE_TAG_*) to appear on an exceptional entry.

   I expect it comes down to an occasional race in RCU lookup of the
   radix_tree: lacking absolute synchronization, we might sometimes
   catch an exceptional entry, with the tag which really belongs with
   the unexceptional entry which was there an instant before."

And indeed, not only is the tree walk lockless, the tags are also read
in chunks, one radix tree node at a time.  There is plenty of time for
page reclaim to swoop in and replace a page that was already looked up
as tagged with a shadow entry.

Remove the BUG() and update the comment.  While reviewing all other
lookup sites for whether they properly deal with shadow entries of
evicted pages, update all the comments and fix memcg file charge moving
to not miss shmem/tmpfs swapcache pages.
