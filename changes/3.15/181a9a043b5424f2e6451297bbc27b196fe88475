ocfs2: fix null pointer dereference when access dlm_state before launching dlm thread

When mounting an ocfs2 volume, it will firstly generate a file
/sys/kernel/debug/o2dlm/<uuid>/dlm_state, and then launch the dlm thread.
So the following situation will cause a null pointer dereference.
dlm_debug_init -> access file dlm_state which will call dlm_state_print ->
dlm_launch_thread

Move dlm_debug_init after dlm_launch_thread and dlm_launch_recovery_thread
can fix this issue.
