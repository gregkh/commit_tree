arm64: Update the TCR_EL1 translation granule definitions for 16K pages

The current TCR register setting in arch/arm64/mm/proc.S assumes that
TCR_EL1.TG* fields are one bit wide and bit 31 is RES1 (reserved, set to
1). With the addition of 16K pages (currently unsupported in the
kernel), the TCR_EL1.TG* fields have been extended to two bits. This
patch updates the corresponding Linux definitions and drops the bit 31
setting in proc.S in favour of the new macros.
