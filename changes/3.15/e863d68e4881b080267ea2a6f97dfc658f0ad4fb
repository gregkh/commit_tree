[SCSI] hpsa: rescan devices on ioaccel2 error

Allow driver to schedule a rescan whenever a request fails on the ioaccel2 path.
This eliminates the possibility of driver getting stuck in non-ioaccel mode.

IOaccel mode (HP SSD Smart Path) is disabled by driver upon error detection.
Driver relied on idea that request would be retried through normal path, and a
subsequent error would occur on that path, and be processed by controller
firmware.  As part of that process, controller disables ioaccel mode and later
reinstates it, signalling driver to change modes.

In some error cases, the error will not duplicate on the standard path,
so the driver could get stuck in non-ioaccel mode.
To avoid that, we allow driver to request a rescan during the next run of the
rescan thread.
