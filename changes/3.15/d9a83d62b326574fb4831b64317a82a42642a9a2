i2c: Add message transfer tracepoints for I2C

Add tracepoints into the I2C message transfer function to retrieve the message
sent or received.  The following config options must be turned on to make use
of the facility:

	CONFIG_FTRACE
	CONFIG_ENABLE_DEFAULT_TRACERS

The I2C tracepoint can be enabled thusly:

	echo 1 >/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/i2c/enable

and will dump messages that can be viewed in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
that look like:

	... i2c_write: i2c-5 #0 a=044 f=0000 l=2 [02-14]
	... i2c_read: i2c-5 #1 a=044 f=0001 l=4
	... i2c_reply: i2c-5 #1 a=044 f=0001 l=4 [33-00-00-00]
	... i2c_result: i2c-5 n=2 ret=2

formatted as:

	i2c-<adapter-nr>
	#<message-array-index>
	a=<addr>
	f=<flags>
	l=<datalen>
	n=<message-array-size>
	ret=<result>
	[<data>]

The operation is done between the i2c_write/i2c_read lines and the i2c_reply
and i2c_result lines so that if the hardware hangs, the trace buffer can be
consulted to determine the problematic operation.

The adapters to be traced can be selected by something like:

	echo adapter_nr==1 >/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/i2c/filter

These changes are based on code from Steven Rostedt.
