[SCSI] qla4xxx: Driver not able to collect minidump for ISP84xx

Issue:
minidump data collection fails as driver reports data mismatch

Fix:
When the driver encounters a new entry type that it cannot process,
it should just skip the entry and adjust the total buffer size by
subtracting the skipped bytes from it. This is to ensure that there
is no data mismatch because of the new entries.
