drm/i915: Generate a hang error code

We get a large number of bugs which have a, "hey I have that too"
because they see a GPU hang in dmesg. While two machines of the same
model having a GPU hang is indeed a coincidence, it is far from enough
evidence to suggest they are the same.

In order to reduce this effect, and hopefully get people to file new bug
reports, clearly the error message itself has been insufficient (see ref
at the bottom for a new bug report with this characteristic).

The algorithm is purposely pretty naive. I don't think we need much in
order to avoid the problem I am trying to solve, and keeping it naive
gives us some ability to make a decent test case.
