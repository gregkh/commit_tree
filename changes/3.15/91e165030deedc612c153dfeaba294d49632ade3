mtd: nand: s3c2410: Trivial cleanup in header file

Commit 436d42c61c3e ("ARM: samsung: move platform_data definitions")
moved the files to the current location but forgot to remove the pointer
to its previous location. Clean it up. While at it also add the header
file protection macros appropriately.
