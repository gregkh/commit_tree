rcutorture: Allow kvm-test-1-rcu.sh to pause after build

Parallel rcutorture runs is valuable on large systems, but it is not a
good idea to do (say) five builds in parallel if each build believes it
has the whole system at its disposal, especially if the system is shared.
It is also bad to restrict the build to (say) a single CPU just because
the corresponding rcutorture run uses only a single CPU.  This commit
therefore adds a kvm-test-1-rcu.sh ability to pause after the build
completes, which will allow kvm.sh to do a number of builds serially
(with each build thus having the full system at its disposal), then
allow the rcutorture runs to proceed in parallel.
