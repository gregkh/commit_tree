i2c: mv64xxx: Fix reset controller handling

The reset framework recently gained optional stubs when CONFIG_RESET_CONTROLLER
is not selected. It also introduced a function reset_get_optional, that is also
dummy-defined whenever the framework isn't enabled, for drivers that needs an
optional reset controller.

Switch to this function, since the mv64xxx driver is in this case. This also
fixes a compilation breakage whenever the reset framework wasn't selected:

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mv64xxx.c:771:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'devm_reset_control_get'

While we're at it, remove the redundant test on dev.of_node surrounding the
calls to reset framework functions, since it will either be a valid pointer, an
error pointer in the case where we called reset_get_optional without an of_node
pointer or if it failed, or NULL if we're not loaded through DT.
