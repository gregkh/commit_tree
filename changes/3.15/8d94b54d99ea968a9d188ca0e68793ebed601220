mmc: mmci: Enable support for busy detection for ux500 variant

The ux500 variants have HW busy detection support, which is indicated
by the busy_detect flag. For these variants let's enable the
MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY flag and add the support for it.

The mmc core will provide the RSP_BUSY command flag for those requests
we should care about busy detection. Regarding the max_busy_timeout,
the HW don't support busy detection timeouts so at this initial step
let's make it simple and set it to zero to indicate we are able to
support any timeout.
