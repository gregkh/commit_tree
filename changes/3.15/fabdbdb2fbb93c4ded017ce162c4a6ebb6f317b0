staging: rtl8192u: make in ieee80211/ieee80211_softmac.c some local functions static

Make some local functions static and fix coding style in these function
declarations when It is necessary

These are the local functions that were made static:

ieee80211_MFIE_rate_len, ieee80211_MFIE_Brate, ieee80211_MFIE_Grate,
ieee80211_WMM_Info, enqueue_mgmt, dequeue_mgmt, init_mgmt_queue,
MgntQuery_MgntFrameTxRate, ieee80211_send_beacon,
ieee80211_send_beacon_cb, ieee80211_softmac_scan_wq,
ieee80211_beacons_start, ieee80211_beacons_stop,
ieee80211_softmac_stop_scan, ieee80211_auth_resp, ieee80211_null_func,
ieee80211_resp_to_assoc_rq, ieee80211_resp_to_auth,
ieee80211_resp_to_probe, ieee80211_associate_abort_cb,
ieee80211_associate_step1, ieee80211_auth_challenge,
ieee80211_associate_step2, ieee80211_associate_complete_wq,
ieee80211_associate_complete, ieee80211_associate_procedure_wq,
auth_rq_parse, assoc_rq_parse, ieee80211_sta_ps_send_null_frame,
ieee80211_sta_ps_sleep, ieee80211_process_action, ieee80211_resume_tx,
ieee80211_start_monitor_mode, ieee80211_start_ibss_wq,
ieee80211_associate_retry_wq, ieee80211_wpa_assoc_frame,
ieee80211_sta_ps, ieee80211_send_probe, ieee80211_start_scan
and ieee80211_assoc_resp
