x86: Remove the PCI reboot method from the default chain

Steve reported a reboot hang and bisected it back to this commit:

  a4f1987e4c54 x86, reboot: Add EFI and CF9 reboot methods into the default list

He heroically tested all reboot methods and found the following:

  reboot=t       # triple fault                  ok
  reboot=k       # keyboard ctrl                 FAIL
  reboot=b       # BIOS                          ok
  reboot=a       # ACPI                          FAIL
  reboot=e       # EFI                           FAIL   [system has no EFI]
  reboot=p       # PCI 0xcf9                     FAIL

And I think it's pretty obvious that we should only try PCI 0xcf9 as a
last resort - if at all.

The other observation is that (on this box) we should never try
the PCI reboot method, but close with either the 'triple fault'
or the 'BIOS' (terminal!) reboot methods.

Thirdly, CF9_COND is a total misnomer - it should be something like
CF9_SAFE or CF9_CAREFUL, and 'CF9' should be 'CF9_FORCE' ...

So this patch fixes the worst problems:

 - it orders the actual reboot logic to follow the reboot ordering
   pattern - it was in a pretty random order before for no good
   reason.

 - it fixes the CF9 misnomers and uses BOOT_CF9_FORCE and
   BOOT_CF9_SAFE flags to make the code more obvious.

 - it tries the BIOS reboot method before the PCI reboot method.
   (Since 'BIOS' is a terminal reboot method resulting in a hang
    if it does not work, this is essentially equivalent to removing
    the PCI reboot method from the default reboot chain.)

 - just for the miraculous possibility of terminal (resulting
   in hang) reboot methods of triple fault or BIOS returning
   without having done their job, there's an ordering between
   them as well.
