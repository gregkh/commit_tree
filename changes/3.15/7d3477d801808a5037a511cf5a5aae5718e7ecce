video: atmel_lcdfb: ensure the hardware is initialized with the correct mode

If no driver takeover the atmel_lcdfb, the lcd won't be in a working state
since atmel_lcdfb_set_par() will never be called. Enabling a driver which does,
like fbcon, will call the function and put atmel_lcdfb in a working state.
