drm/dp: Add AUX channel infrastructure

This is a superset of the current i2c_dp_aux bus functionality and can
be used to transfer native AUX in addition to I2C-over-AUX messages.

Helpers are provided to read and write the DPCD, either blockwise or
byte-wise. Many of the existing helpers for DisplayPort take a copy of a
portion of the DPCD and operate on that, without a way to write data
back to the DPCD (e.g. for configuration of the link).

Subsequent patches will build upon this infrastructure to provide common
functionality in a generic way.
