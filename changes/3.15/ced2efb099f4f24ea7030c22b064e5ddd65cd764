perf/x86/uncore: add hrtimer to SNB uncore IMC PMU

This patch is needed because that PMU uses 32-bit free
running counters with no interrupt capabilities.

On SNB/IVB/HSW, we used 20GB/s theoretical peak to calculate
the hrtimer timeout necessary to avoid missing an overflow.
That delay is set to 5s to be on the cautious side.

The SNB IMC uses free running counters, which are handled
via pseudo fixed counters. The SNB IMC PMU implementation
supports an arbitrary number of events, because the counters
are read-only. Therefore it is not possible to track active
counters. Instead we put active events on a linked list which
is then used by the hrtimer handler to update the SW counts.
