arm64: Relax the kernel cache requirements for boot

With system caches for the host OS or architected caches for guest OS we
cannot easily guarantee that there are no dirty or stale cache lines for
the areas of memory written by the kernel during boot with the MMU off
(therefore non-cacheable accesses).

This patch adds the necessary cache maintenance during boot and relaxes
the booting requirements.
