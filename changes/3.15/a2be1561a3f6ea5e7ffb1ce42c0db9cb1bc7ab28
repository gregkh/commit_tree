ARM: mvebu: use C preprocessor include for Armada 375/38x DTs

Some of the Armada 375/38x DTs that were recently submitted were still
using the old-style /include/ instead of the new-style, C-preprocessor
based #include. Since we are going to start including more headers,
switching to the C-preprocessor based includes is important.
