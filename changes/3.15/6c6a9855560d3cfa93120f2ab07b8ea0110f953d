mac802154: fix duplicate #include headers

The commit e6278d92005e ("mac802154: use header operations to
create/parse headers") included the header

		net/ieee802154_netdev.h

which had been included by the commit b70ab2e87f17 ("ieee802154:
enforce consistent endianness in the 802.15.4 stack"). Fix this
duplicate #include by deleting the latter one as the required header
has already been in place.
