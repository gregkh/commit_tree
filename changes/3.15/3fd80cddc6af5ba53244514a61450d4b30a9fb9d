locks: report l_pid as -1 for FL_FILE_PVT locks

FL_FILE_PVT locks are no longer tied to a particular pid, and are
instead inheritable by child processes. Report a l_pid of '-1' for
these sorts of locks since the pid is somewhat meaningless for them.

This precedent comes from FreeBSD. There, POSIX and flock() locks can
conflict with one another. If fcntl(F_GETLK, ...) returns a lock set
with flock() then the l_pid member cannot be a process ID because the
lock is not held by a process as such.
