spi: fsl: Fix problem with multi message transfers

When used via spidev with more than one messages to tranfer via
SPI_IOC_MESSAGE the current implementation would return with
-EINVAL, since bits_per_word and speed_hz are set in all
transfer structs. And in the 2nd loop status will stay at
-EINVAL as its not overwritten again via fsl_spi_setup_transfer().

This patch changes this behavious by first checking if one of
the messages uses different settings. If this is the case
the function will return with -EINVAL. If not, the messages
are transferred correctly.
