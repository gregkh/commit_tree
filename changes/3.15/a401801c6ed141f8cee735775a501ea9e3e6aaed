be2net: add FW cmds needed for VxLAN offloads

This patch adds support for the FW cmds needed for VxLAN offloads
on Skyhawk-R:
1) The VxLAN UDP port needs to be configured via the port-desc of
   SET_PROFILE_CONFIG_v1 cmd.
   This patch re-factors the be_set_profile_config() code (used so far
   only for setting VF QoS) to be used to set any type of descriptor.
2) The MANAGE_IFACE_FILTERS cmds is needed to convert a normal interface
   into a tunnel interface. This allows for RSS to work even on the inner
   TCP/UDP headers of VxLAN traffic.
