staging: comedi: pcl818: tidy up pcl818_check()

This function probes a number of the boards registers during the
(*attach) to verify that it is actually a PCL-818 compatible board.
For aesthetics, move the function closer to the (*attach).

Refactor the function to return an errno if fails. Change the errno
from -EIO to -ENODEV and remove the unnecessary comedi_error() noise.

Make sure the CONTROL register is reset to a known state after the
check. The 0x18 value actually defines an invalid interrupt selection
and sets an undefined bit.

Add a couple comments to clarify the magic values.
