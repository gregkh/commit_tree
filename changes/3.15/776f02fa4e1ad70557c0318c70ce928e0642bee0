cgroup: remove cgroupfs_root->refcnt

Currently, cgroupfs_root and its ->top_cgroup are separated reference
counted and the latter's is ignored.  There's no reason to do this
separately.  This patch removes cgroupfs_root->refcnt and destroys
cgroupfs_root when the top_cgroup is released.

* cgroup_put() updated to ignore cgroup_is_dead() test for top
  cgroups.  cgroup_free_fn() updated to handle root destruction when
  releasing a top cgroup.

* As root destruction is now bounced through cgroup destruction, it is
  asynchronous.  Update cgroup_mount() so that it waits for pending
  release which is currently implemented using msleep().  Converting
  this to proper wait_queue isn't hard but likely unnecessary.
