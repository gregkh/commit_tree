KVM: PPC: Book3S: Introduce hypervisor call H_GET_TCE

This introduces the H_GET_TCE hypervisor call, which is basically the
reverse of H_PUT_TCE, as defined in the Power Architecture Platform
Requirements (PAPR).

The hcall H_GET_TCE is required by the kdump kernel, which uses it to
retrieve TCEs set up by the previous (panicked) kernel.
