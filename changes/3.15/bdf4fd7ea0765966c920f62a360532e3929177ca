drm/i915: Do aliasing PPGTT init with contexts

We have a default context which suits the aliasing PPGTT well. Tie them
together so it looks like any other context/PPGTT pair. This makes the
code cleaner as it won't have to special case aliasing as often.

The patch has one slightly tricky part in the default context creation
function. In the future (and on aliased setup) we create a new VM for a
context (potentially). However, if we have aliasing PPGTT, which occurs
at this point in time for all platforms GEN6+, we can simply manage the
refcounting to allow things to behave as normal. Now is a good time to
recall that the aliasing_ppgtt doesn't have a real VM, it uses the GGTT
drm_mm.
