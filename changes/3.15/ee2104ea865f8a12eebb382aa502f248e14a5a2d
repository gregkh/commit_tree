staging/bcm: integer underflow leads to Oom

We do:

        if (NOB > DEFAULT_BUFF_SIZE)
                BuffSize = DEFAULT_BUFF_SIZE;
        else
                BuffSize = NOB;

Since NOB can be negative it results in a larger than intended BuffSize
and makes kzalloc() fail.

The code is still a bit crap because it lets the users read as much as
they want from nvram, but I don't know what a sensible upper limit
should be.
