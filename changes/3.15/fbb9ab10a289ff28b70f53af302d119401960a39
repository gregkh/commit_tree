e1000e: Expand workaround for 10Mb HD throughput bug

In commit 772d05c51c4f4896c120ad418b1e91144a2ac813 "e1000e: slow performance
between two 82579 connected via 10Mbit hub", a workaround was put into place
to address the overaggressive transmit behavior of 82579 parts when connecting
at 10Mbs half-duplex.

This same behavior is seen on i217 and i218 parts as well.  This patch expands
the original workaround to encompass these parts.
