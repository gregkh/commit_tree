sysfs: make sure read buffer is zeroed

13c589d5b0ac ("sysfs: use seq_file when reading regular files")
switched sysfs from custom read implementation to seq_file to enable
later transition to kernfs.  After the change, the buffer passed to
->show() is acquired through seq_get_buf(); unfortunately, this
introduces a subtle behavior change.  Before the commit, the buffer
passed to ->show() was always zero as it was allocated using
get_zeroed_page().  Because seq_file doesn't clear buffers on
allocation and neither does seq_get_buf(), after the commit, depending
on the behavior of ->show(), we may end up exposing uninitialized data
to userland thus possibly altering userland visible behavior and
leaking information.

Fix it by explicitly clearing the buffer.
