ACPI / notify: Do not block unknown type notifications in root handler

Commit 1a699476e258 "ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Hotplug notifications from
acpi_bus_notify()" changed the root notify handler, acpi_bus_notify(),
to block unknown type norifications, but it overlooked the fact that
they might be propagated to drivers via the ->notify() callback.

Fix the problem by allowing drivers to receive unknown type
notifications via ->notify() as before.
