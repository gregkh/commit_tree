PCI: Increment max correctly in pci_scan_bridge()

This patch fixes two small issues:
 - If pci_add_new_bus() fails, max must not be incremented. Otherwise
   an incorrect value is returned from pci_scan_bridge().
 - If the bus is already present, max must be incremented. I think
   that this case should only be hit if we trigger a manual rescan of a
   CardBus bridge.
