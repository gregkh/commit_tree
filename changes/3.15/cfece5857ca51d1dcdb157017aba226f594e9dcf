[media] V4L2: ov7670: fix a wrong index, potentially Oopsing the kernel from user-space

Commit 75e2bdad8901a0b599e01a96229be922eef1e488 "ov7670: allow
configuration of image size, clock speed, and I/O method" uses a wrong
index to iterate an array. Apart from being wrong, it also uses an
unchecked value from user-space, which can cause access to unmapped
memory in the kernel, triggered by a normal desktop user with rights to
use V4L2 devices.
