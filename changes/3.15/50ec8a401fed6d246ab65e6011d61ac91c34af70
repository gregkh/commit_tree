sched/numa: Track from which nodes NUMA faults are triggered

Track which nodes NUMA faults are triggered from, in other words
the CPUs on which the NUMA faults happened. This uses a similar
mechanism to what is used to track the memory involved in numa faults.

The next patches use this to build up a bitmap of which nodes a
workload is actively running on.
