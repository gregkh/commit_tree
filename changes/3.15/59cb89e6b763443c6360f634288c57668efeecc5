doc: update driver TX algorithm in timestamping.txt

Since cd4d8fdad1f1 ("net: kernel panic in dev_hard_start_xmit:
remove faulty software TX time stamping") dev_hard_start_xmit()
will not provide software timestamps. It's a responsibility of
the drivers to call skb_tx_timestamp() at the right time.
