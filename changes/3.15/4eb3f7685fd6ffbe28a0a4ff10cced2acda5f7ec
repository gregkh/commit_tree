i40e: eeprom integrity check on load and empr

The driver needs to verify the eeprom checksum and firmware crc status bits,
and shutdown the driver if they fail. This code stops the processing of traffic,
but doesn't kill the PF netdev so that the NVMUpdate process should still have a
chance at fixing the image. The eeprom is checked on driver load and after an
EMP reset, the latter of which should be generated after an NVMUpdate.
