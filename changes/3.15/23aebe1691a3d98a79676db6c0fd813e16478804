exec: kill bprm->tcomm[], simplify the "basename" logic

Starting from commit c4ad8f98bef7 ("execve: use 'struct filename *' for
executable name passing") bprm->filename can not go away after
flush_old_exec(), so we do not need to save the binary name in
bprm->tcomm[] added by 96e02d158678 ("exec: fix use-after-free bug in
setup_new_exec()").

And there was never need for filename_to_taskname-like code, we can
simply do set_task_comm(kbasename(filename).

This patch has to change set_task_comm() and trace_task_rename() to
accept "const char *", but I think this change is also good.
