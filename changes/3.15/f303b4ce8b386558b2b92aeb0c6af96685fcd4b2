KVM: SVM: fix NMI window after iret

We should open NMI window right after an iret, but SVM exits before it.
We wanted to single step using the trap flag and then open it.
(or we could emulate the iret instead)
We don't do it since commit 3842d135ff2 (likely), because the iret exit
handler does not request an event, so NMI window remains closed until
the next exit.

Fix this by making KVM_REQ_EVENT request in the iret handler.
