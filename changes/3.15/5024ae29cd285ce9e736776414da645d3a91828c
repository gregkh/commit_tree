cgroup: introduce task_css_is_root()

Determining the css of a task usually requires RCU read lock as that's
the only thing which keeps the returned css accessible till its
reference is acquired; however, testing whether a task belongs to the
root can be performed without dereferencing the returned css by
comparing the returned pointer against the root one in init_css_set[]
which never changes.

Implement task_css_is_root() which can be invoked in any context.
This will be used by the scheduled cgroup_freezer change.

v2: cgroup no longer supports modular controllers.  No need to export
    init_css_set.  Pointed out by Li.
