net: filter: move filter accounting to filter core

This patch basically does two things, i) removes the extern keyword
from the include/linux/filter.h file to be more consistent with the
rest of Joe's changes, and ii) moves filter accounting into the filter
core framework.

Filter accounting mainly done through sk_filter_{un,}charge() take
care of the case when sockets are being cloned through sk_clone_lock()
so that removal of the filter on one socket won't result in eviction
as it's still referenced by the other.

These functions actually belong to net/core/filter.c and not
include/net/sock.h as we want to keep all that in a central place.
It's also not in fast-path so uninlining them is fine and even allows
us to get rd of sk_filter_release_rcu()'s EXPORT_SYMBOL and a forward
declaration.

Joint work with Alexei Starovoitov.
