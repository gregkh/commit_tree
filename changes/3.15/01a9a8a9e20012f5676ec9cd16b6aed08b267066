Btrfs: send, fix corrupted path strings for long paths

If a path has more than 230 characters, we allocate a new buffer to
use for the path, but we were forgotting to copy the contents of the
previous buffer into the new one, which has random content from the
kmalloc call.

Test:

    mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdd
    mount /dev/sdd /mnt

    TEST_PATH="/mnt/fdmanana/.config/google-chrome-mysetup/Default/Pepper_Data/Shockwave_Flash/WritableRoot/#SharedObjects/JSHJ4ZKN/s.wsj.net/[[IMPORT]]/players.edgesuite.net/flash/plugins/osmf/advanced-streaming-plugin/v2.7/osmf1.6/Ak#"
    mkdir -p $TEST_PATH
    echo "hello world" > $TEST_PATH/amaiAdvancedStreamingPlugin.txt

    btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt /mnt/mysnap1
    btrfs send /mnt/mysnap1 -f /tmp/1.snap

A test for xfstests follows.
