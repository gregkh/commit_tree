packet: report tx_dropped in packet_direct_xmit

Since commit 015f0688f57c ("net: net: add a core netdev->tx_dropped
counter"), we can now account for TX drops from within the core
stack instead of drivers.

Therefore, fix packet_direct_xmit() and increase drop count when we
encounter a problem before driver's xmit function was called (we do
not want to doubly account for it).
