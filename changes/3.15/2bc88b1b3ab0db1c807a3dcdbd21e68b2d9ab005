ARM: dts: vf610: use the interrupt macros

This patch uses the IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH/IRQ_TYPE_NONE to replace
the hardcode.

[shawn.guo: While at it, we also fix the typo in uart0 interrupts
property, where the 0x00 should 0x04.  Hense, it should also be
IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH just like other UART instances.]
