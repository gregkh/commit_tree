Bluetooth: Fix response on confirm_name

According to mgmt-api.txt, in case of confirm name command,
cmd_complete should be always use as a response. Not command status
as it is now for failures.
Using command complete on failure is actually better as client might
be interested in device address for which confirm name failed.
