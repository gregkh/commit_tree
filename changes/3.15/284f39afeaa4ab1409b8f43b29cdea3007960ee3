mm: memcg: push !mm handling out to page cache charge function

Only page cache charges can happen without an mm context, so push this
special case out of the inner core and into the cache charge function.

An ancient comment explains that the mm can also be NULL in case the
task is currently being migrated, but that is not actually true with the
current case, so just remove it.
