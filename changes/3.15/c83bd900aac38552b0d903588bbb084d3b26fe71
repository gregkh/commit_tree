PCI: Mark 64-bit resource as IORESOURCE_UNSET if we only support 32-bit

If we don't support 64-bit addresses, i.e., CONFIG_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT is not
set, we can't deal with BARs above 4GB.  In this case we already pretend
the BAR contained zero; this patch also sets IORESOURCE_UNSET so we can try
to reallocate it later.

I don't think this is exactly correct: what we care about here are *bus*
addresses, not CPU addresses, so the tests of sizeof(resource_size_t)
probably should be on sizeof(dma_addr_t) instead.  But this is what's been
in -next, so we'll fix that later.
