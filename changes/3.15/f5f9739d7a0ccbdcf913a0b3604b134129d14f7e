sched: Put rq's sched_avg under CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED

The struct sched_avg of struct rq is only used in case group
scheduling is enabled inside __update_tg_runnable_avg() to update
per-cpu representation of a task group.  I.e. that there is no need to
maintain the runnable avg of a rq in the !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED case.

This patch guards struct sched_avg of struct rq and
update_rq_runnable_avg() with CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED.

There is an extra empty definition for update_rq_runnable_avg()
necessary for the !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED && CONFIG_SMP case.

The function print_cfs_group_stats() which prints out struct sched_avg
of struct rq is already guarded with CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED.
