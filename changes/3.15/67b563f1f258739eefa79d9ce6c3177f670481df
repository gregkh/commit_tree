spmi: pmic_arb: add support for interrupt handling

The Qualcomm PMIC Arbiter, in addition to being a basic SPMI controller,
also implements interrupt handling for slave devices.  Note, this is
outside the scope of SPMI, as SPMI leaves interrupt handling completely
unspecified.

Extend the driver to provide a irq_chip implementation and chained irq
handling which allows for these interrupts to be used.
