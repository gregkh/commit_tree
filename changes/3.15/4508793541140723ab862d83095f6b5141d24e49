tools lib traceevent: Fix backward compatibility macros for pevent filter enums

The return value for pevent_filter_match() is suppose to return FILTER_NONE
if the event doesn't have a filter, and FILTER_NOEXIST if there is no filter
at all. But the change 41e12e580a7 "tools lib traceevent: Refactor
pevent_filter_match() to get rid of die()" replaced the return value
with PEVENT_ERRNO__* values and added "backward compatibility" macros
that used the old names. Unfortunately, the NOEXIST and NONE macros were
swapped, and this broke users that use the old return names.
