ASoC: simple-card: overwrite cpu_dai->fmt with codec_dai->fmt

The current simple-card driver separates the daimft for cpu_dai and codec_dai.
So we might get different values for them (0x4003 and 0x1003 for example):

asoc-simple-card sound-cs42888.12: cpu : 2024000.esai / 4003 / 132000000
asoc-simple-card sound-cs42888.12: codec : cs42888 / 1003 / 24576000
asoc-simple-card sound-cs42888.12: cs42888 <-> 2024000.esai mapping ok

This is not allowed at all as we need to keep the DAIFMT settings identical
for both the ends of the link.

Thus this patch fixes it by overwriting the cpu_dai->fmt with codec_dai->fmt
since we defined the DAIFMT_MASTER basing on CODEC at the first place while
the other bits are same.
