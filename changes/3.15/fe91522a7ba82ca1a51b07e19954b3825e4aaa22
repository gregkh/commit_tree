don't remove from shrink list in select_collect()

	If we find something already on a shrink list, just increment
data->found and do nothing else.  Loops in shrink_dcache_parent() and
check_submounts_and_drop() will do the right thing - everything we
did put into our list will be evicted and if there had been nothing,
but data->found got non-zero, well, we have somebody else shrinking
those guys; just try again.
