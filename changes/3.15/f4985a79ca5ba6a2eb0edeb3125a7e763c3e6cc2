staging: comedi: pcl818: don't calc the timer divisors twice

The timer divisors are calculated in the (*do_cmdtest) before the (*do_cmd)
is called by the comedi core. The extra sanity checks in the (*do_cmd) are
not necessary, the values returned from i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer() will be
greater than 1. Save the values in the private data so they don't need to be
recalced.

Refactor pcl818_start_pacer() to use the values from the private data.
