tipc: explicitly include core.h in addr.h

The inline functions in addr.h uses tipc_own_addr which is exported by
core.h, but addr.h never actually includes it. It works because it is
explicitly included where this is used, but it looks a bit strange.

Include core.h in addr.h explicitly to make the dependency clearer.
