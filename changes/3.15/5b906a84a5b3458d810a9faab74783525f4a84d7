Bluetooth: Support resolvable private addresses

Only identity addresses are inserted into hdev->pend_le_conns. So,
in order to support resolvable private addresses in auto connection
mechanism, we should resolve the address before checking for pending
connections.

Thus, this patch adds an extra check in check_pending_le_conn() and
updates 'addr' and 'addr_type' variables before hci_pend_le_conn_
lookup().
