gianfar: Avoid unnecessary reg accesses in adjust_link()

For phy devices that don't issue interrupts upon link
state changes, phylib polls the link state resulting in
repeated calls to adjust_link(), even if the link state
didn't change.  As a result, some mac registers are
repeatedly read and written with the same values, which
is not ok.

To fix this, adjust_link() has been refactored to check
first whether the link state has changed and to take action
only if needed, updating mac registers and local state
variables.  The 'new_state' local flag, set if one of the
link params changed (link, speed or duplex), has been
rendered useless and removed by this refactoring.
