w1: ds2490 USB setup fixes

Calling usb_reset_configuration after usb_set_interface resets the
interface that was just selected, so call reset first.
Using alternative 3 greatly speeds the one wire search.
alt 0 or 1, 10ms int, 23.16 seconds
alt 2 or 3,  1ms int, 2.99 to 3.05 seconds

Use usb_interrupt_msg not usb_bulk_msg as it is an interrupt pipe
(bulk worked, it was just technically the wrong call).
