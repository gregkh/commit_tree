staging/octeon-ethernet: Call dev_kfree/consume_skb_any instead of dev_kfree_skb.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_kfree_skb_any in cvm_oct_xmit_pow which
can be called in hard irq and other contexts, on the code paths that
drop packets.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in cvm_oct_xmit_pow which
can be called in hard irq and other contexts, on the code path where
the packet is transmitted successfully.
