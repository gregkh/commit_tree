perf machine: Search for modules in %s/lib/modules/%s

Modules installed outside of the kernel's build system should go into
"%s/lib/modules/%s/extra", but at present, perf will only look at them
when they are in "%s/lib/modules/%s/kernel". Lets encourage good
citizenship by relaxing this requirement to "%s/lib/modules/%s". This
way open source modules that are out-of-tree have no incentive to start
populating a directory reserved for in-kernel modules and I can stop
hex-editing my system's perf binary when profiling OSS out-of-tree
modules.

Feedback from Namhyung Kim correctly revealed that the hex-edits that I
had been doing meant that perf was also traversing the build and source
symlinks in %s/lib/modules/%s. That is undesireable, so we explicitly
exclude them from traversal with a minor tweak to the traversal routine.
