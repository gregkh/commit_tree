perf symbols: Apply all filters to an addr_location

Instead of bailing out as soon as we find a filter that applies, go on
checking all of them so that we can zoom in/out filters.

We also need to make sure we only update al->filtered after
thread__find_addr_map(), because there is where al->filtered gets
initialized to zero.

This will increase the cost of processing when all we don't need this
toggling, but will provide flexibility for the TUI and GTK+ interfaces,
that will incur in creating the hist_entries just once.
