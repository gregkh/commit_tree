[SCSI] dual scan thread bug fix

In the highly unusual case where two threads are running concurrently through
the scanning code scanning the same target, we run into the situation where
one may allocate the target while the other is still using it.  In this case,
because the reap checks for STARGET_CREATED and kills the target without
reference counting, the second thread will do the wrong thing on reap.

Fix this by reference counting even creates and doing the STARGET_CREATED
check in the final put.
