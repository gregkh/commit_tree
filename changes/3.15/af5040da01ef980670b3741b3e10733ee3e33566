blktrace: fix accounting of partially completed requests

trace_block_rq_complete does not take into account that request can
be partially completed, so we can get the following incorrect output
of blkparser:

  C   R 232 + 240 [0]
  C   R 240 + 232 [0]
  C   R 248 + 224 [0]
  C   R 256 + 216 [0]

but should be:

  C   R 232 + 8 [0]
  C   R 240 + 8 [0]
  C   R 248 + 8 [0]
  C   R 256 + 8 [0]

Also, the whole output summary statistics of completed requests and
final throughput will be incorrect.

This patch takes into account real completion size of the request and
fixes wrong completion accounting.
