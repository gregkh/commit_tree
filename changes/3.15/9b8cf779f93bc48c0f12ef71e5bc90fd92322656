irqchip: armada-370-xp: Add helper for the MSI IRQ handling

Introduce a helper function to handle the MSI interrupts. This makes
the code more readable. In addition, this will allow to introduce a
chained IRQ handler mechanism, which is needed in situations where the
MPIC is used as a slave to another interrupt controller.
