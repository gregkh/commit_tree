perf tools: Drop prefetch.h

This was needed at the time before e66eed651fd1 ("list: remove
prefetching from regular list iterators") where the list iterators did
prefetch elements. This turned out to be counter-productive and hurt
performance and they were removed. Which makes the prefetch.h header
unused so drop it.
