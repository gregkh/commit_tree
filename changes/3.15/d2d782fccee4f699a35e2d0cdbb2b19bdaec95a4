HID: sony: Prevent duplicate controller connections.

If a Sixaxis or Dualshock 4 controller is connected via USB while already
connected via Bluetooth it will cause duplicate devices to be added to the
input device list.

To prevent this a global list of controllers and their MAC addresses is
maintained and new controllers are checked against this list.  If a duplicate
is found, the probe function will exit with -EEXIST.

On USB the MAC is retrieved via a feature report.  On Bluetooth neither
controller reports the MAC address in a feature report so the MAC is parsed from
the uniq string.  As uniq cannot be guaranteed to be a MAC address in every case
(uHID or the behavior of HIDP changing) a parsing failure will not prevent the
connection.
