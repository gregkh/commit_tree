ASoC: alc5623: Fix regmap endianness

Commit 0cd257bf9b9b0cbb4fa1a5c988a232506997867c, "ASoC: alc5623:
Convert to direct regmap API usage" broke probing of the codec,
because of wrong endinness of the ID and codec version read from the
device. Fix this by removing the existing flipping of the endiannes,
and extracting the codec type byte from the word from the regmap.
