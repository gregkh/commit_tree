hwpoison, hugetlb: lock_page/unlock_page does not match for handling a free hugepage

For handling a free hugepage in memory failure, the race will happen if
another thread hwpoisoned this hugepage concurrently.  So we need to
check PageHWPoison instead of !PageHWPoison.

If hwpoison_filter(p) returns true or a race happens, then we need to
unlock_page(hpage).
