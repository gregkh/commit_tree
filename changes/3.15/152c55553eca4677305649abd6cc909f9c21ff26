ARM: integrator: only select pl01x if TTY is enabled

Building the integrator platform without TTY support currently
results in a build failure because we always turn on the
pl010 or pl011 drivers. Changing this to a conditional 'select'
statement enables us to build more random configurations, although
it should have little impact for practical configurations.
