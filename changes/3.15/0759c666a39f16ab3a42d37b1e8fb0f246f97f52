[SCSI] scsi_debug: add ability to enable clustering

This adds a module parameter to enable clustering.

Without enabling clustering support, the transfer length for read and
write scsi commands is limited upto 8MB when page size is 4KB and
sg_tablesize is 2048 (= SCSI_MAX_SG_CHAIN_SEGMENTS).  I would like to
test commands with more than that transfer length.
