ASoC: core: use regmap's parse_val to do endian translation

    In snd_soc_bytes_put function, it forces cpu to do cpu_to_be translation,
but for mmio bus which uses REGMAP_ENDIAN_NATIVE, it doesn't need to do
endian translation. So it is better to use regmap's api which can decide
if this translation is needed according to bus configuration.
