xen-netback: Add stat counters for zerocopy

These counters help determine how often the buffers had to be copied. Also
they help find out if packets are leaked, as if "sent != success + fail",
there are probably packets never freed up properly.

NOTE: if bisect brought you here, you should apply the series up until
"xen-netback: Timeout packets in RX path", otherwise Windows guests can't work
properly and malicious guests can block other guests by not releasing their sent
packets.
