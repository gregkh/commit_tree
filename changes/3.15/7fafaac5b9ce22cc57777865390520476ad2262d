rcutorture: Fix rcutorture shutdown races

Not all of the rcutorture kthreads waited for kthread_should_stop()
before returning from their top-level functions, and none of them
used torture_shutdown_absorb() properly.  These problems can result in
segfaults and hangs at shutdown time, and some recent changes perturbed
timing sufficiently to make them much more probable.  This commit
therefore creates a torture_kthread_stopping() function that does the
proper kthread shutdown dance in one centralized location.

Accommodate this grouping by making VERBOSE_TOROUT_STRING() capable of
taking a non-const string as its argument, which allows the new
torture_kthread_stopping() to pass its "title" argument directly to
the updated version of VERBOSE_TOROUT_STRING().
