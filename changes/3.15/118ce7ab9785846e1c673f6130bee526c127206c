atm: nicstar: remove interruptible_sleep_on_timeout

We are trying to finally kill off interruptible_sleep_on_timeout.
the two uses in the nicstar driver can be trivially replaced
with wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout, which prevents the
wake-up race and is able to check the buffer state with scq->lock
held.
