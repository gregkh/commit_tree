ARM: mvebu: switch the Armada XP DB to use internal registers at 0xf1000000

Marvell has now provided bootloaders that are Device Tree capable for
the Armada XP DB board, and that also remap the internal register base
address to 0xf1000000. In addition, the bootloader now sets the MBus
Window base address to 0xf0000000, but on this board, this change
doesn't make much difference since the board is by default equipped
with 2 GB of RAM.

Therefore this commit updates the soc->ranges Device Tree property
with the fact that the internal registers are now mapped at
0xf1000000.
