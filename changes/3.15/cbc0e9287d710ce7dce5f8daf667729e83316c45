Btrfs: remove unneeded field / smaller extent_map structure

We don't need to have an unsigned int field in the extent_map struct
to tell us whether the extent map is in the inode's extent_map tree or
not. We can use the rb_node struct field and the RB_CLEAR_NODE and
RB_EMPTY_NODE macros to achieve the same task.

This reduces sizeof(struct extent_map) from 152 bytes to 144 bytes (on a
64 bits system).
