vlan: Fix lockdep warning with stacked vlan devices.

This reverts commit dc8eaaa006350d24030502a4521542e74b5cb39f.
	vlan: Fix lockdep warning when vlan dev handle notification

Instead we use the new new API to find the lock subclass of
our vlan device.  This way we can support configurations where
vlans are interspersed with other devices:
  bond -> vlan -> macvlan -> vlan
