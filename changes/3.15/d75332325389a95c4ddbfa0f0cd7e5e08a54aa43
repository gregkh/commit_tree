s390/PCI: Use generic pci_enable_resources()

The generic pci_enable_resources() does essentially the same thing as the
code in the s390 version of pcibios_enable_device().

There are differences, but I don't think any of them are a problem.  The
generic code:

  - Checks everything up to PCI_NUM_RESOURCES, not PCI_BAR_COUNT (6), so
    we'll now check the ROM resource, IOV resources, and bridge windows.

  - Checks for res->flags & IORESOURCE_UNSET.  The s390 code never sets
    IORESOURCE_UNSET, so this isn't a problem.

  - Checks res->parent.  The s390 pcibios_add_device() calls
    pci_claim_resource() on all BARs (except ROM, IOV, and bridge windows)
    so this isn't a problem either.
