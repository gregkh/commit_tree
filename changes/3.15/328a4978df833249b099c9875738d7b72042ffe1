genirq: Add a new IRQCHIP_EOI_THREADED flag

The flag is necessary for interrupt chips which require an ACK/EOI
after the handler has run. In case of threaded handlers this needs to
happen after the threaded handler has completed before the unmask of
the interrupt.

The flag is only unseful in combination with the handle_fasteoi_irq
flow control handler.

It can be combined with the flag IRQCHIP_EOI_IF_HANDLED, so the EOI is
not issued when the interrupt is disabled or in progress.
