ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Drop acpiphp_bus_add()

acpiphp_bus_add() is only called from one place, so move the code out
of it into that place and drop it.  Also make that code use
func_to_acpi_device() to get the struct acpi_device pointer it needs
instead of calling acpi_bus_get_device() which may be costly.
