ARM: 8052/1: unwind: Fix handling of "Pop r4-r[4+nnn],r14" opcode

The arm EABI states that unwind opcode 10100nnn means pop register r4-4[4+nnn],aditionally there is a similar unwind opcode: 10101nnn which means the same thing plus popping r14. Those two cases are handled by the unwind_exec_pop_r4_to_rN function which checks whether the 4th bit is set and does r14 popping.

However, up until now it has been checking whether the 8th bit was set (mask & 0x80) instead of the 4th (mask & 0x8), a simple to make typo but this meant that we were always popping r14 even if we had the former opcode.

This patch changes the mask so that the 2 unwind opcodes are being handled correctly.
