can: allow to change the device mtu for CAN FD capable devices

The configuration for CAN FD depends on CAN_CTRLMODE_FD enabled in the driver
specific ctrlmode_supported capabilities.

The configuration can be done either with the 'fd { on | off }' option in the
'ip' tool from iproute2 or by setting the CAN netdevice MTU to CAN_MTU (16) or
to CANFD_MTU (72).
