Bluetooth: Use unresolvable private address for active scanning

When running active scanning during LE discovery, do not reveal the own
identity to the peer devices. In case LE privacy has been enabled, then
a resolvable private address is used. If the LE privacy option is off,
then use an unresolvable private address.

The public address or static random address is never used in active
scanning anymore. This ensures that scan request are send using a
random address.
