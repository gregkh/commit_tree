drm/exynos: hdmi: remove the i2c drivers and use

The i2c client was previously being passed into the hdmi driver via a
dedicated i2c driver, and then a global variable. This patch removes all
of that and just uses the device tree to get the i2c_client. This patch
also properly references the client so we don't lose it before we're
done with it.
