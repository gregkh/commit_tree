bonding: permit using arp_validate with non-ab modes

Currently it's disabled because it's sometimes hard, in typical configs, to
make it work - because of the nature how the loadbalance modes work - as
it's hard to deliver valid arp replies to correct slaves by the switch.

However we still can use arp_validation in loadbalance with several other
configs, per example with arp_validate == 2 for backup with one broadcast
domain, without the switch(es) doing any balancing - this way we'd be (a
bit more) sure that the slave is up.

So, enable it to let users decide which one works/suits them best. Also
correct the mode limitation from BOND_OPT_ARP_VALIDATE.
