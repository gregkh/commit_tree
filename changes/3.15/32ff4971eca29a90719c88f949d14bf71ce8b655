ARM: orion5x: make dns323 independent of PHY support

The D-Link DNS-323 machine tries to unconditionally select CONFIG_PHYLIB,
but that has other dependencies that might not necessarily be enabled,
causing random build errors.

To work around this, this patch removes the 'select' statement and
instead uses a compile-time check to skip the phy_register_fixup_for_uid()
call if PHYLIB is not available in the kernel.
