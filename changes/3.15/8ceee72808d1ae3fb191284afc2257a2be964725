crypto: ghash-clmulni-intel - use C implementation for setkey()

The GHASH setkey() function uses SSE registers but fails to call
kernel_fpu_begin()/kernel_fpu_end(). Instead of adding these calls, and
then having to deal with the restriction that they cannot be called from
interrupt context, move the setkey() implementation to the C domain.

Note that setkey() does not use any particular SSE features and is not
expected to become a performance bottleneck.
