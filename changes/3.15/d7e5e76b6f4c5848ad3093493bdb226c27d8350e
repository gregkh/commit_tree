Bluetooth: Always use l2cap_chan->psm for returning PSM to user space

The l2cap_chan->psm value is always set to a valid value for a
connection oriented channel. The l2cap_chan->sport is used for tracking
local PSM allocations but will not always have a proper value, such as
with connected sockets derived from a listening socket. This patch fixes
the sock_getname callback to always use chan->psm when returning address
information.
