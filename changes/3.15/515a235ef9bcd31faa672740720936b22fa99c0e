checkpatch: improve octal permissions test speed

The current octal permissions test is very slow.

When patch ("checkpatch: add checks for constant non-octal permissions")
was added, processing time approximately tripled.

Regain almost all of the performance by not looping through all the
possible functions unless the line contains one of the functions.
