powerpc/book3s: Fix mc_recoverable_range buffer overrun issue.

Currently we wrongly allocate mc_recoverable_range buffer (to hold
recoverable ranges) based on size of the property "mcheck-recoverable-ranges".
This results in allocating less memory to hold available recoverable range
entries from /proc/device-tree/ibm,opal/mcheck-recoverable-ranges.

This patch fixes this issue by allocating mc_recoverable_range buffer based
on number of entries of recoverable ranges instead of device property size.
Without this change we end up allocating less memory and run into memory
corruption issue.
