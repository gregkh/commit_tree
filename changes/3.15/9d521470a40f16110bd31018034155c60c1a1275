libceph: a per-osdc crush scratch buffer

With the addition of erasure coding support in the future, scratch
variable-length array in crush_do_rule_ary() is going to grow to at
least 200 bytes on average, on top of another 128 bytes consumed by
rawosd/osd arrays in the call chain.  Replace it with a buffer inside
struct osdmap and a mutex.  This shouldn't result in any contention,
because all osd requests were already serialized by request_mutex at
that point; the only unlocked caller was ceph_ioctl_get_dataloc().
