s390/compat: add sync_file_range and fallocate compat syscalls

The compat syscall wrappers for sync_file_range and fallocate merged 32 bit
parameters into 64 bit parameters. Therefore they did more than just the
usual zero and/or sign extension of system call parameters.

So convert these two wrappers to full s390 specific compat sytem calls.
