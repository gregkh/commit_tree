Revert "HID: microsoft: Add ID's for Surface Type/Touch Cover 2"

This reverts commit 117309c51dca42121f70cacec801511b76acf75c.

The MS Surface Pro 2 has an USB composite device with 3 interfaces
- interface 0 - sensor hub
- interface 1 - wacom digitizer
- interface 2 - the keyboard cover, if one is attached
This USB composite device changes it product id dependent on if and which
keyboard cover is attached. Adding the covers to hid_have_special_driver
prevents loading the right hid drivers for the other two interfaces, all 3
get loaded with hid-microsoft. We don't even need hid-microsoft for the
keyboards. We have to revert this to load the right hid modules for each
interface.
