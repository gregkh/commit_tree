fuse: update mtime on open(O_TRUNC) in atomic_o_trunc mode

In case of fc->atomic_o_trunc is set, fuse does nothing in
fuse_do_setattr() while handling open(O_TRUNC). Hence, i_mtime must be
updated explicitly in fuse_finish_open(). The patch also adds extra locking
encompassing open(O_TRUNC) operation to avoid races between the truncation
and updating i_mtime.
