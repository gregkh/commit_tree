Bluetooth: Connection parameters and auto connection

This patch modifies hci_conn_params_add() and hci_conn_params_del() so
they also add/delete pending LE connections according to the auto_
connect option. This way, background scan is automatically triggered/
untriggered when connection parameters are added/removed.

For instance, when a new connection parameters with HCI_AUTO_CONN_ALWAYS
option is added and we are not connected to the device, we add a pending
LE connection for that device.

Likewise, when the connection parameters are updated we add or delete
a pending LE connection according to its new auto_connect option.

Finally, when the connection parameter is deleted we also delete the
pending LE connection (if any).
