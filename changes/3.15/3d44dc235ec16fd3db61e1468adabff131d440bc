mtd: nand: flctl: Add dependency on HAS_IOMEM and HAS_DMA

On archs like S390 or um this driver cannot build nor work.
Make it depend on HAS_IOMEM and HAS_DMA to bypass build failures.

drivers/built-in.o: In function `flctl_probe':
drivers/mtd/nand/sh_flctl.c:1097: undefined reference to `devm_ioremap_resource'
drivers/built-in.o: In function `flctl_dma_fifo0_transfer':
drivers/mtd/nand/sh_flctl.c:368: undefined reference to `dma_map_single'
drivers/mtd/nand/sh_flctl.c:407: undefined reference to `dma_unmap_single'
