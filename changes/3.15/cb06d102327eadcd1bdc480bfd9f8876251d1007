igb: Fix Null-pointer dereference in igb_reset_q_vector

When igb_set_interrupt_capability() calls
igb_reset_interrupt_capability() (e.g., because CONFIG_PCI_MSI is unset),
num_q_vectors has been set but no vector has yet been allocated.

igb_reset_interrupt_capability() will then call igb_reset_q_vector,
which assumes that the vector is allocated. As this is not the case, we
are accessing a NULL-pointer.

This patch fixes it by checking that q_vector is indeed different from
NULL.
