w1: small type cleanup in sysfs

On 64 bit systems, a large value for "long tmp" is truncated when
assigning to "int md->max_slave_count" so we still end up with a value
less than one despite the "tmp < 1" check.

This is more of a problem for static checkers than a real life issue,
but it's simple enough to fix.
