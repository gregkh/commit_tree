SubmittingPatches: add recommendation for mailing list references

SubmittingPatches already mentions referencing bugs fixed by a commit,
but doesn't mention citing relevant mailing list discussions.  Add a
note to that effect, along with a recommendation to use the
https://lkml.kernel.org/ redirector.

Portions based on text from git's SubmittingPatches.
