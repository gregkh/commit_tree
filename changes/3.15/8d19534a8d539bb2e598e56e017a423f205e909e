spi: sh-msiof: Use the core cs_gpio field, and make it optional

In current implementation, CS is controlled by GPIO, which is passed
through spi->controller_data.  However, the MSIOF HW module has a function
to output CS by itself, which is already enabled and actual switch will be
done by pinmux.

Store the GPIO number in the core cs_gpio field, and ignore it if it is
an invalid (negative) GPIO number.

Loosely based on a patch from Takashi Yoshii <takasi-y@ops.dti.ne.jp>.
