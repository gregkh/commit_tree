PCI: pciehp: Remove a non-existent card, regardless of "surprise" capability

In case a card is physically yanked out, it should immediately be removed,
regardless of the "surprise" capability bit. Thus:

  - Always handle the physical removal - regardless of the "surprise" bit.
  - Don't use "surprise" capability when making decisions about enabling
    presence detect notifications.
  - Reword the comments to indicate the intent.
