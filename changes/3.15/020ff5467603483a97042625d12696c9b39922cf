drm/radeon: set PIPE_CONFIG for 1D and linear tiling modes on CIK

This fixes fast color clear with 1D-tiled single-sample surfaces
and Hyper-Z corruption with 1D-tiled depth surfaces.

Even though it seems it is not needed for 1D tiling, CMASK and HTILE are
always 2D-tiled, thus the hw needs to know the actual pipe configuration
for CMASK and HTILE addressing no matter what the tiling mode of the surface
is.
