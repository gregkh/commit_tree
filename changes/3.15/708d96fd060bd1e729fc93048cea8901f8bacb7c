vsprintf: remove %n handling

All in-kernel users of %n in format strings have now been removed and
the %n directive is ignored.  Remove the handling of %n so that it is
treated the same as any other invalid format string directive.  Keep a
warning in place to deter new instances of %n in format strings.
