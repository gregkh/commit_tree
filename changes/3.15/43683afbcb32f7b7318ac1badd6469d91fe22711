arm64: debug: remove noisy, pointless warning

Sending a SIGTRAP to a user task after execution of a BRK instruction at
EL0 is fundamental to the way in which software breakpoints work and
doesn't deserve a warning to be logged in dmesg. Whilst the warning can
be justified from EL1, do_debug_exception will already do the right thing,
so simply remove the code altogether.
