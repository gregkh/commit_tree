mfd: lpc_ich: Add support for iTCO v3

Some newer Atom CPUs, eg Avoton and Bay Trail, use slightly different
register layouts for the iTCO than the current v1 and v2 iTCO.
Differences from previous iTCO versions include:
- The ACPI space is enabled in the "ACPI base address" register instead
  of the "ACPI control register"

- The "no reboot" functionality is set in the "Power Management
  Configuration" register instead of the "General Control and Status"
  (GCS) register or PCI configuration space.

- The "ACPI Control Register" is not present on v3.  The "Power
  Management Configuration Base Address" register resides at the same
  address is Avoton/Bay Trail.

To differentiate these newer chipsets create a new v3 iTCO version and
update the MFD driver to support them.
