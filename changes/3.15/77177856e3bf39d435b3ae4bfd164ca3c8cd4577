sched: Init idle->on_rq in init_idle()

We stumbled in RT over a SMP bringup issue on ARM where the
idle->on_rq == 0 was causing try_to_wakeup() on the other cpu to run
into nada land.

After adding that idle->on_rq = 1; I was able to find the root cause
of the lockup: the idle task on the newly woken up cpu was fiddling
with a sleeping spinlock, which is a nono.

I kept the init of idle->on_rq to keep the state consistent and to
avoid another long lasting debug session.

As a side note, the whole debug mess could have been avoided if
might_sleep() would have yelled when called from the idle task. That's
fixed with patch 2/6 - and that one actually has a changelog :)
