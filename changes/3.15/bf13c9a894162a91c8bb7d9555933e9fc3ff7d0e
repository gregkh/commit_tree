serial: sh-sci: Add missing call to uart_remove_one_port() in failure path

If cpufreq_register_notifier() fails, we have to remove the port added by
sci_probe_single(), which is not done by sci_cleanup_single().

Else the serial port stays active from the point of view of the serial
subsystem, and it may crash when userspace getty is started, or when the
loadable driver module is unloaded.

This was introduced by commit 6dae14216c85eea13db7b12c469475c5d30e5499
("serial: sh-sci: Fix probe error paths").
