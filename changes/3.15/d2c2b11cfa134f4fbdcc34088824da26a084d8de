device_cgroup: check if exception removal is allowed

[PATCH v3 1/2] device_cgroup: check if exception removal is allowed

When the device cgroup hierarchy was introduced in
	bd2953ebbb53 - devcg: propagate local changes down the hierarchy

a specific case was overlooked. Consider the hierarchy bellow:

	A	default policy: ALLOW, exceptions will deny access
	 \
	  B	default policy: ALLOW, exceptions will deny access

There's no need to verify when an new exception is added to B because
in this case exceptions will deny access to further devices, which is
always fine. Hierarchy in device cgroup only makes sure B won't have
more access than A.

But when an exception is removed (by writing devices.allow), it isn't
checked if the user is in fact removing an inherited exception from A,
thus giving more access to B.

Example:

	# echo 'a' >A/devices.allow
	# echo 'c 1:3 rw' >A/devices.deny
	# echo $$ >A/B/tasks
	# echo >/dev/null
	-bash: /dev/null: Operation not permitted
	# echo 'c 1:3 w' >A/B/devices.allow
	# echo >/dev/null
	#

This shouldn't be allowed and this patch fixes it by making sure to never allow
exceptions in this case to be removed if the exception is partially or fully
present on the parent.

v3: missing '*' in function description
v2: improved log message and formatting fixes
