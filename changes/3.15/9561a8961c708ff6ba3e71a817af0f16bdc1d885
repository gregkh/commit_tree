kernfs: fix hash calculation in kernfs_rename_ns()

3eef34ad7dc3 ("kernfs: implement kernfs_get_parent(),
kernfs_name/path() and friends") restructured kernfs_rename_ns() such
that new name assignment happens under kernfs_rename_lock;
unfortunately, it mistakenly passed NULL to kernfs_name_hash() to
calculate the new hash if the name hasn't changed, which can lead to
oops.

Fix it by using kn->name and kn->ns when calculating the new hash.
