ext4: fix error return from ext4_ext_handle_uninitialized_extents()

Commit 3779473246 breaks the return of error codes from
ext4_ext_handle_uninitialized_extents() in ext4_ext_map_blocks().  A
portion of the patch assigns that function's signed integer return
value to an unsigned int.  Consequently, negatively valued error codes
are lost and can be treated as a bogus allocated block count.
