clk: Fix notifier documentation

Contradicting to documenation, the notifier callbacks do receive
the original clock rate in struct clk_notifier_data.old_rate and the new
frequency struct clk_notifier_data.new_rate, independent of the
notification reason.

This behavior also seems to make more sense, since callbacks can use the
same code to deterimine whether clocks are scaled up or down. Something
which would not even possible in the post-rate-change case if the
behavior was as documented.
