irqchip: armada-370-xp: Setup a chained handler for the MPIC

The new Armada 375 and Armada 38x Marvell SoCs are based on Cortex-A9
CPU cores and use the ARM GIC as their main interrupt controller.
However, for various purposes (wake-up from suspend, MSI interrupts),
they have kept a separate MPIC interrupt controller, acting as a slave
to the GIC. This MPIC was already used as the primary controller on
previous Marvell SoCs, so this commit extends the existing driver to
allow the MPIC to be used as a GIC slave.
