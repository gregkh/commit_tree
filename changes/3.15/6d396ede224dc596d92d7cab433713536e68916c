Input: synaptics - T540p - unify with other LEN0034 models

The T540p has a touchpad with pnp-id LEN0034, all the models with this
pnp-id have the same min/max values, except the T540p where the values are
slightly off. Fix them to be identical.

This is a preparation patch for simplifying the quirk table.
