iio: Add si7005 relative humidity and temperature sensor driver

sensor provides 12-bit relative humidity and 14-bit temperature
via I2C interface; temperature and linearity compensation is not
implemented (yet)

driver also supports the Si7015, but not the 2nd generation
sensors Si7013/Si7020/Si7021

datasheet is here

v2: (thanks to Lars-Peter Clausen)
* fix coding style
* use devm_iio_device_register()
* change copyright year to 2014
