perf probe: Fix --line option behavior

The commit 5a62257a3ddd1 ("perf probe: Replace line_list with
intlist") replaced line_list to intlist but it has a problem that if a
same line was added again, it'd return -EEXIST rather than 1.

Since line_range_walk_cb() only checks the result being negative, it
resulted in failure or segfault sometimes.
