x86, boot: Move memset() definition in compressed/string.c

Currently compressed/misc.c needs to link against memset(). I think one of
the reasons of this need is inclusion of various header files which define
static inline functions and use memset() inside these. For example,
include/linux/bitmap.h

I think trying to include "../string.h" and using builtin version of memset
does not work because by the time "#define memset" shows up, it is too
late. Some other header file has already used memset() and expects to
find a definition during link phase.

Currently we have a C definitoin of memset() in misc.c. Move it to
compressed/string.c so that others can use it if need be.
