crypto: caam - remove error propagation handling

Commit 61bb86bba169507a5f223b94b9176c32c84b4721
("crypto: caam - set descriptor sharing type to SERIAL")
changed the descriptor sharing mode from SHARE_WAIT to SHARE_SERIAL.

All descriptor commands that handle the "ok to share" and
"error propagation" settings should also go away, since they have no
meaning for SHARE_SERIAL.
