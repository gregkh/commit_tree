libceph: primary_temp infrastructure

Add primary_temp mappings infrastructure.  struct ceph_pg_mapping is
overloaded, primary_temp mappings are stored in an rb-tree, rooted at
ceph_osdmap, in a manner similar to pg_temp mappings.

Dump primary_temp mappings to /sys/kernel/debug/ceph/<client>/osdmap,
one 'primary_temp <pgid> <osd>' per line, e.g:

    primary_temp 2.6 4
