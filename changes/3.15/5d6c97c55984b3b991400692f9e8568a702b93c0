tracing: Do not try to recreated toplevel set_ftrace_* files

With the restructing of the function tracer working with instances, the
"top level" buffer is a bit special, as the function tracing is mapped
to the same set of filters. This is done by using a "global_ops" descriptor
and having the "set_ftrace_filter" and "set_ftrace_notrace" map to it.

When an instance is created, it creates the same files but its for the
local instance and not the global_ops.

The issues is that the local instance creation shares some code with
the global instance one and we end up trying to create th top level
"set_ftrace_*" files twice, and on boot up, we get an error like this:

 Could not create debugfs 'set_ftrace_filter' entry
 Could not create debugfs 'set_ftrace_notrace' entry

The reason they failed to be created was because they were created
twice, and the second time gives this error as you can not create the
same file twice.
