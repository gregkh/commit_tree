irqchip: irq-crossbar: Not allocating enough memory

We are allocating the size of a pointer and not the size of the data.
This will lead to memory corruption.

There isn't actually a "cb_device" struct, btw.  The code is only able
to compile because GCC knows that all pointers are the same size.

Fixes: 96ca848ef7ea ('DRIVERS: IRQCHIP: CROSSBAR: Add support for Crossbar IP')
