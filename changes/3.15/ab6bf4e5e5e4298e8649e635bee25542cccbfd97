crypto: hash - Fix the pointer voodoo in unaligned ahash

Add documentation for the pointer voodoo that is happening in crypto/ahash.c
in ahash_op_unaligned(). This code is quite confusing, so add a beefy chunk
of documentation.

Moreover, make sure the mangled request is completely restored after finishing
this unaligned operation. This means restoring all of .result, .base.data
and .base.complete .

Also, remove the crypto_completion_t complete = ... line present in the
ahash_op_unaligned_done() function. This type actually declares a function
pointer, which is very confusing.

Finally, yet very important nonetheless, make sure the req->priv is free()'d
only after the original request is restored in ahash_op_unaligned_done().
The req->priv data must not be free()'d before that in ahash_op_unaligned_finish(),
since we would be accessing previously free()'d data in ahash_op_unaligned_done()
and cause corruption.
