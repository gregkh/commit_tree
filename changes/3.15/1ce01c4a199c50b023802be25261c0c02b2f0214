ext4: fix COLLAPSE_RANGE test failure in data journalling mode

When mounting ext4 with data=journal option, xfstest shared/002 and
shared/004 are currently failing as checksum computed for testfile
does not match with the checksum computed in other journal modes.
In case of data=journal mode, a call to filemap_write_and_wait_range
will not flush anything to disk as buffers are not marked dirty in
write_end. In collapse range this call is followed by a call to
truncate_pagecache_range. Due to this, when checksum is computed,
a portion of file is re-read from disk which replace valid data with
NULL bytes and hence the reason for the difference in checksum.

Calling ext4_force_commit before filemap_write_and_wait_range solves
the issue as it will mark the buffers dirty during commit transaction
which can be later synced by a call to filemap_write_and_wait_range.
