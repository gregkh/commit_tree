dm mpath: really fix lockdep warning

lockdep complains about a circular locking.  And indeed, we need to
release the lock before calling dm_table_run_md_queue_async().

As such, commit 4cdd2ad ("dm mpath: fix lock order inconsistency in
multipath_ioctl") must also be reverted in addition to fixing the
lock order in the other dm_table_run_md_queue_async() callers.
