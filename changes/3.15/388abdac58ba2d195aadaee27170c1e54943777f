staging: cxt1e1: cleanup mfg_template[] a bit

1) Make it static.
2) Change it to u8 data instead of short.
3) This means we can memcpy() it to the correct location instead of
   using a for loop.
4) With memcpy() we can use the union member we want directly instead of
   copying to the generic .bytes union member.
