mmc: omap_hsmmc: support more DT properties

This should probably be done implicitly through mmc_of_parse(), but that
doesn't play well along with the multi-slot model the hsmmc driver
features. Hence, for now, do it manually. The properties are already
documented in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt.
