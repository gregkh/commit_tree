lockdep: Change lockdep_set_novalidate_class() to use _and_name

Cosmetic. This doesn't really matter because a) device->mutex is
the only user of __lockdep_no_validate__ and b) this class should
be never reported as the source of problem, but if something goes
wrong "&dev->mutex" looks better than "&__lockdep_no_validate__"
as the name of the lock.
