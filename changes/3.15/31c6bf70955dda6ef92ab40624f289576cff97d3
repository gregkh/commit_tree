usb: core: let dynamic ids override static ids

This modifies the probing order so that any matching
dynamic entry always will be used, even if the driver
has a matching static entry.

It is sometimes useful to dynamically update existing
device entries. With the new ability to set the dynamic
entry driver_info field, this can be used to test new
additions to class driver exception lists or proposed
changes to existing static per-device driver_info
entries.
