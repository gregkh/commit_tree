ARM: show_regs: on v7-M there are no FIQs, different processor modes, ...

no indication about irqs in PSR and only a single ISA. So skip the whole
decoding and just print the xPSR on v7-M.

Also mark two static variables as __maybe_unused to prevent the compiler
from emitting:

	arch/arm/kernel/process.c:51:20: warning: 'processor_modes' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
	arch/arm/kernel/process.c:58:20: warning: 'isa_modes' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
