Staging: comedi: Correct a few printf format codes

My static checker found some slightly inaccurate format codes in printf
calls in comedi_fops.c and drivers/comedi_bond.c.  It may be slightly
pedantic to change them, but using the correctly corresponding format
codes is probably a good idea.  All but one were unsigned ints that were
formatted with %i, change these to %u, and one was an int formatted with
%u, we want to format this with %d.
