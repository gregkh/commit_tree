mm: postpone the disabling of kmemleak early logging

Commit 8910ae896c8c ("kmemleak: change some global variables to int"),
in addition to the atomic -> int conversion, moved the disabling of
kmemleak_early_log to the beginning of the kmemleak_init() function,
before the full kmemleak tracing is actually enabled.  In this small
window, kmem_cache_create() is called by kmemleak which triggers
additional memory allocation that are not traced.  This patch restores
the original logic with kmemleak_early_log disabling when kmemleak is
fully functional.

Fixes: 8910ae896c8c (kmemleak: change some global variables to int)
