fanotify: use fanotify event structure for permission response processing

Currently, fanotify creates new structure to track the fact that
permission event has been reported to userspace and someone is waiting
for a response to it.  As event structures are now completely in the
hands of each notification framework, we can use the event structure for
this tracking instead of allocating a new structure.

Since this makes the event structures for normal events and permission
events even more different and the structures have different lifetime
rules, we split them into two separate structures (where permission
event structure contains the structure for a normal event).  This makes
normal events 8 bytes smaller and the code a tad bit cleaner.
