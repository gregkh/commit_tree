PCI: designware: Fix RC BAR to be single 64-bit non-prefetchable memory BAR

The Synopsys PCIe core provides one pair of 32-bit BARs (BAR 0 and BAR 1).
The BARs can be configured as follows:

  - One 64-bit BAR: BARs 0 and 1 are combined to form a single 64-bit BAR
  - Two 32-bit BARs: BARs 0 and 1 are two independent 32-bit BARs

This patch corrects 64-bit, non-prefetchable memory BAR configuration
implemented in dw driver.
