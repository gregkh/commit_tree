arm64: Convert asm/tlb.h to generic mmu_gather

Over the past couple of years, the generic mmu_gather gained range
tracking - 597e1c3580b7 (mm/mmu_gather: enable tlb flush range in generic
mmu_gather), 2b047252d087 (Fix TLB gather virtual address range
invalidation corner cases) - and tlb_fast_mode() has been removed -
29eb77825cc7 (arch, mm: Remove tlb_fast_mode()).

The new mmu_gather structure is now suitable for arm64 and this patch
converts the arch asm/tlb.h to the generic code. One functional
difference is the shift_arg_pages() case where previously the code was
flushing the full mm (no tlb_start_vma call) but now it flushes the
range given to tlb_gather_mmu() (possibly slightly more efficient
previously).
