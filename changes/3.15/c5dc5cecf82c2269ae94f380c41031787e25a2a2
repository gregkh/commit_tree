drm/i915: Create a USES_PPGTT macro

There are cases where we want to know if there is a full, or aliased
PPGTT. Currently, in fact the only distinction we ever need to make is
when we're using full PPGTT.

This patch is simply to promote readability and clarify for the
confusing existing usage where "aliasing" meant aliasing and full.

v2: Remove USES_ALIASING_PPGTT since there are currently no cases where
we need to check if we're using aliasing, but not full PPGTT. (Daniel)
