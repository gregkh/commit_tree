can: c_can: remove obsolete STRICT_FRAME_ORDERING Kconfig option

In 2b9aecdce2 ("can: c_can: Disable rx split as workaround") a new Kconfig
option was introduced as a workaround. The tests performed by Alexander Stein
confirmed this option to be obsolete with all the other cleanups and fixes
that had been discussed that time:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-can&m=139746476821294&w=2

Both (author and tester) agreed to remove this Kconfig option again:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-can&m=139883820714229&w=2

As some more cleanups took place since then a simple revert is not possible.
This patch removes the entire option as it would behave when disabled.
Further beautificationâ€™s can be done later.
