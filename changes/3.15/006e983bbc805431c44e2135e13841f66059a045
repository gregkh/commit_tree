DRIVERS: IRQCHIP: IRQ-GIC: Add support for routable irqs

In some socs the gic can be preceded by a crossbar IP which
routes the peripheral interrupts to the gic inputs. The peripheral
interrupts are associated with a fixed crossbar input line and the
crossbar routes that to one of the free gic input line.

The DT entries for peripherals provides the fixed crossbar input line
as its interrupt number and the mapping code should associate this with
a free gic input line. This patch adds the support inside the gic irqchip
to handle such routable irqs. The routable irqs are registered in a linear
domain. The registered routable domain's callback should be implemented
to get a free irq and to configure the IP to route it.
