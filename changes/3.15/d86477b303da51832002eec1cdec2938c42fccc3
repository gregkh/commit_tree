Btrfs: add missing error check in incremental send

Function wait_for_parent_move() returns negative value if an error
happened, 0 if we don't need to wait for the parent's move, and
1 if the wait is needed.
Before this change an error return value was being treated like the
return value 1, which was not correct.
