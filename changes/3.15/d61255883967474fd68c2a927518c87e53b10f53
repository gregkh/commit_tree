staging: comedi: pcl818: remove 'io_range' from boardinfo

The 'io_range' is the same for all board types. Remove this data from
the boardinfo.

The i/o resource size is larger for board types that have a FIFO but this
larger region is only requested if the user wants to use the fifo.

Modify the pcl818_attach() to remove the need for the 'io_range' in the
private data.

For aesthetics, rename the 'fifo' member in the boardinfo to 'has_fifo'
and change it to a bit-field.
