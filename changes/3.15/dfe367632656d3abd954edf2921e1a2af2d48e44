ARM: at91: don't provide dt init code for at91x40

at91x40 has no support for device tree, but Kconfig allows
us to enable CONFIG_OF anyway, causing a link error in the
at91 reset controller initialization.

The easiest fix is to adapt the existing #ifdef to omit
the broken code on at91x40 where it is never called anyway.
