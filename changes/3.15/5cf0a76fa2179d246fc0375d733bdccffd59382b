iommu/vt-d: Clean up size handling for intel_iommu_unmap()

We have this horrid API where iommu_unmap() can unmap more than it's asked
to, if the IOVA in question happens to be mapped with a large page.

Instead of propagating this nonsense to the point where we end up returning
the page order from dma_pte_clear_range(), let's just do it once and adjust
the 'size' parameter accordingly.

Augment pfn_to_dma_pte() to return the level at which the PTE was found,
which will also be useful later if we end up changing the API for
iommu_iova_to_phys() to behave the same way as is being discussed upstream.
