staging/usbip: change usbip userspace to include new uapi usbip.h

usbip userspace has duplicated enum definition to report usbip device
status maintained by the kernel. A new uapi usbip.h now defines the
usbip device status for kernel and userspace to use. Change usbip
userspace to include uapi usbip.h for usbip device status.
