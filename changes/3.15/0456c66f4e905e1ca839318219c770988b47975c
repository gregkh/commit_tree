Input: serio - add firmware_id sysfs attribute

serio devices exposed via platform firmware interfaces such as ACPI may
provide additional identifying information of use to userspace.

We don't associate the serio devices with the firmware device (we don't
set it as parent), so there's no way for userspace to make use of this
information.

We cannot change the parent for serio devices instantiated though a
firmware interface as that would break suspend / resume ordering.

Therefore this patch adds a new firmware_id sysfs attribute so that
userspace can get a string from there with any additional identifying
information the firmware interface may provide.
