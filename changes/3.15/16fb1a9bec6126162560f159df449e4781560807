arm64: vdso: clean up vdso_pagelist initialization

Remove some unnecessary bits that were apparently carried over from
another architecture's implementation:

- No need to get_page() the vdso text/data - these are part of the
  kernel image.
- No need for ClearPageReserved on the vdso text.
- No need to vmap the first text page to check the ELF header - this
  can be done through &vdso_start.

Also some minor cleanup:
- Use kcalloc for vdso_pagelist array allocation.
- Don't print on allocation failure, slab/slub will do that for us.
