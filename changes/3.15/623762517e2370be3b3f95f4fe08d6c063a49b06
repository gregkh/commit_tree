revert "mm: vmscan: do not swap anon pages just because free+file is low"

This reverts commit 0bf1457f0cfc ("mm: vmscan: do not swap anon pages
just because free+file is low") because it introduced a regression in
mostly-anonymous workloads, where reclaim would become ineffective and
trap every allocating task in direct reclaim.

The problem is that there is a runaway feedback loop in the scan balance
between file and anon, where the balance tips heavily towards a tiny
thrashing file LRU and anonymous pages are no longer being looked at.
The commit in question removed the safe guard that would detect such
situations and respond with forced anonymous reclaim.

This commit was part of a series to fix premature swapping in loads with
relatively little cache, and while it made a small difference, the cure
is obviously worse than the disease.  Revert it.
