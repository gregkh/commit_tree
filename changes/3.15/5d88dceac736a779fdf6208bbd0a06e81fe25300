pinctrl: Quiet logging about missing DT nodes when not using DT

On systems which were not booted using DT it is entirely unsurprising that
device nodes don't have any DT information and this is going to happen for
every single device in the system. Make pinctrl be less chatty about this
situation by only logging in the case where we have DT.
