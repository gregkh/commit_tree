HID: core: do not scan constant input report

The Microsoft Surface Type/Touch Cover 2 is a fancy device which advertised
itself as a multitouch device but with constant input reports.
This way, hid_scan_report() gives the group MULTITOUCH to it, but
hid-multitouch can not handle it due to the constant collection ignored
by hid-input.

To prevent such crap in the future, and while we do not fix this particular
device, make the scan_report coherent with hid-input.c, and ignore constant
input reports.
