powerpc/spufs: Remove MAX_USER_PRIO define

Current ppc64_defconfig fails with:

 arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spufs/sched.c:86:0: error: "MAX_USER_PRIO" redefined [-Werror]
 cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

Commit 6b6350f155af ("sched: Expose some macros related to priority")
introduced a generic MAX_USER_PRIO macro to sched/prio.h, which is
causing the conflit. Use that one instead of our own.
