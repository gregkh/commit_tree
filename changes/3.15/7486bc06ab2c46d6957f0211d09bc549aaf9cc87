lustre: Unsafe error handling around ll_splice_alias

Callers of ll_splice_alias() should not assign the returned pointer to
the dentry since it can be an err pointer. Fixed the above bug using a
temporary dentry pointer. This temporary pointer is assigned to dentry
only if ll_splice_alias has not returned an err pointer.
