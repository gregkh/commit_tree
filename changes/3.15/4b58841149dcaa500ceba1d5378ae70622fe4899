audit: Add generic compat syscall support

lib/audit.c provides a generic function for auditing system calls.
This patch extends it for compat syscall support on bi-architectures
(32/64-bit) by adding lib/compat_audit.c.
What is required to support this feature are:
 * add asm/unistd32.h for compat system call names
 * select CONFIG_AUDIT_ARCH_COMPAT_GENERIC
