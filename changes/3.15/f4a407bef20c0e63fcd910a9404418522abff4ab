Bluetooth: Wait for SMP key distribution completion when pairing

When we initiate pairing through mgmt_pair_device the code has so far
been waiting for a successful HCI Encrypt Change event in order to
respond to the mgmt command. However, putting privacy into the play we
actually want the key distribution to be complete before replying so
that we can include the Identity Address in the mgmt response.

This patch updates the various hci_conn callbacks for LE in mgmt.c to
only respond in the case of failure, and adds a new mgmt_smp_complete
function that the SMP code will call once key distribution has been
completed.

Since the smp_chan_destroy function that's used to indicate completion
and clean up the SMP context can be called from various places,
including outside of smp.c, the easiest way to track failure vs success
is a new flag that we set once key distribution has been successfully
completed.
