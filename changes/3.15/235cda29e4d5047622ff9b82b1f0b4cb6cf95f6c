ARM: shmobile: Remove Lager USBHS UDC ifdefs

Remove ifdefs to make the Lager USBHS device always present.
This makes it more like other devices, no need to be special.

Also, these ifdefs by themselves do not hurt much, but combined
with USB Host device ifdefs that were proposed earlier we could
basically end up with a kernel that drives VBUS incorrectly
depending on the kernel configuration - lets not do that.
