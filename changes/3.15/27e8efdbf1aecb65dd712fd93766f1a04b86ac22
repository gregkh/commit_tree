ARM: 7986/1: bios32: use pci_enable_resource to enable PCI resources

This patch moves bios32 over to using the generic code for enabling PCI
resources. Since the core code takes care of bridge resources too, we
can also drop the explicit IO and MEMORY enabling for them in the arch
code.

A side-effect of this change is that we no longer explicitly enable
devices when running in PCI_PROBE_ONLY mode. This stays closer to the
meaning of the option and prevents us from trying to enable devices
without any assigned resources (the core code refuses to enable
resources without parents).
