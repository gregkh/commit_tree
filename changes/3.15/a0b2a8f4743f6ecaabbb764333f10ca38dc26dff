wireless: Kconfig: add missing dependency for airo_cs

commit 4c59ff221e070 "wireless: Kconfig: add missing dependency" added a number
of 'depends on CFG80211' statements, but missed the AIRO_CS driver that
also causes the airo.c file to be built. This adds the (hopefully) last
such missing statement
