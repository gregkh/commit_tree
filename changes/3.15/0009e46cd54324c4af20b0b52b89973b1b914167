drm/i915: Track which ring a context ran on

Previously we dropped the association of a context to a ring. It is
however very important to know which ring a context ran on (we could
have reused the other member, but I was nitpicky).

This is very important when we switch address spaces, which unlike
context objects, do change per ring.

As an example, if we have:

        RCS   BCS
ctx            A
ctx      A
ctx      B
ctx            B

Without tracking the last ring B ran on, we wouldn't know to switch the
address space on BCS in the last row.

As a result, we no longer need to track which ring a context "belongs"
to, as it never really made much sense anyway.
