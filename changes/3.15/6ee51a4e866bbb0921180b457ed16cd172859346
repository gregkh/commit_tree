mlx4: Adjust QP1 multiplexing for RoCE/SRIOV

This requires the following modifications:
1. Fix build_mlx4_header to properly fill in the ETH fields
2. Adjust mux and demux QP1 flow to support RoCE.

This commit still assumes only one GID per slave for RoCE.
The commit enabling multiple GIDs is a subsequent commit, and
is done separately because of its complexity.
