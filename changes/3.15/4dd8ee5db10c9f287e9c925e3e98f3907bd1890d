MIPS: Add CP0 CMGCRBase definitions & accessor

The CMGCRBase register is defined by the PRA specification as an optional
register which indicates the physical base of the MIPS Coherence Manager
Global Control Register block. This patch simply adds a definition for
the base address field within the register, along with an accessor
function for reading the register.
