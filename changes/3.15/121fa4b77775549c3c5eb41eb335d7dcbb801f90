xen-netback: Minor refactoring of netback code

This patch contains a few bits of refactoring before introducing the grant
mapping changes:
- introducing xenvif_tx_pending_slots_available(), as this is used several
  times, and will be used more often
- rename the thread to vifX.Y-guest-rx, to signify it does RX work from the
  guest point of view
