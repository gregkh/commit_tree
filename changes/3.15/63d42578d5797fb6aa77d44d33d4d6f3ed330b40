lustre/recovery: free open/close request promptly

- For the non-create open or committed open, the open request
  should be freed along with the close request as soon as the
  close done, despite that the transno of open/close is
  greater than the last committed transno known by client or not.

- Move the committed open request into another dedicated list,
  that will avoid scanning a huge replay list on receiving each
  reply (when there are many open files).
