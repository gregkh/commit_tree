powerpc: Rate-limit users spamming kernel log buffer

The facility unavailable exception can be triggered from userspace by
accessing PMU registers when EBB is not enabled.  This causes the
included pr_err() to run, hence spamming the kernel log buffer.

This avoids this by rate limiting these messages.
