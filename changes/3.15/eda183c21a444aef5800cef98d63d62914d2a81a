ixgbe: clean up Rx time stamping code

Time stamping resources are per-interface so there is no need
to keep separate last_rx_timestamp for each Rx ring, move
last_rx_timestamp to the adapter structure.

With last_rx_timestamp inside adapter, ixgbe_ptp_rx_hwtstamp()
inline function is reduced to a single if statement so it is
no longer necessary. If statement is placed directly in
ixgbe_process_skb_fields() fixing likely/unlikely marking.

Checks for q_vector or adapter to be NULL are superfluous.

Comment about taking I/O hit is a leftover from previous design.
