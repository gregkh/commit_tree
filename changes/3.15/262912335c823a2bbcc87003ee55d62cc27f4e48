[media] rc-main: fix missing unlock if no devno left

While playing with make coccicheck I noticed this message:
drivers/media/rc/rc-main.c:1245:3-9: preceding lock on line 1238

It was introduced by commit 587d1b06e07b ([media] rc-core: reuse device
numbers) which returns -ENOMEM after a mutex_lock without first
unlocking it when there are no more device numbers left. The added code
doesn't depend on the device lock, so move it before the lock is taken.
