brcmfmac: remove mode field from brcmf_cfg80211_vif structure

The nl80211 iftype was converted to a mode value and stored in
brcmf_cfg80211_vif structure. The value was used only within
brcmfmac driver to decide execution of conditional code. Better
use wireless_dev::iftype for that as the wdev is contained in
the brcmf_cfg80211_vif structure.
