mwifiex: memory corruption in mwifiex_tdls_add_vht_capab()

There is a typo here because the names are confusingly similar.  The
intent was sizeof(struct ieee80211_vht_cap) (size 12) but sizeof(struct
ieee80211_ht_cap) (size 32) was used.

Anway, it's cleaner to just specify the variable instead of the type.
