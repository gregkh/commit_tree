drm/i915: Get context early in execbuf

We need to have the address space when reserving space for the objects.
Since the address space and context are tied together, and reserve
occurs before context switch (for good reason), we must lookup our
context earlier in the process.

This leaves some room for optimizations where we no longer need to use
ctx_id in certain places. This will be addressed in a subsequent patch.

Important tricky bit:
Because slow relocations during execbuffer drop struct_mutex

Perhaps it would be best to acquire the reference when we get the
context, but I'll save that for another day (note I have written the
patch before, and I found the changes required to be uglier than this).

Note that since we currently access everything via context id, and not
the data structure this is fine, though not desirable. The next change
attempts to get the context only once via the context ID idr lookup, and
as such, the following can happen:

CTX-A is created, refcount = 1
CTX-A execbuf, mutex dropped
close IOCTL called on CTX-A, refcount = 0
CTX-A resumes in execbuf.
