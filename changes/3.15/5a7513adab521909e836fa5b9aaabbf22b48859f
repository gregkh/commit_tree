can: c_can: Simplify TX interrupt cleanup

The function loads the message object from the hardware to get the
payload length. The previous patch stores that information in an
array, so we can avoid the hardware access.

Remove the hardware access and move the led toggle outside of the
spinlocked region. Toggle the led only once when at least one packet
has been received.

Binary size shrinks along with the code
