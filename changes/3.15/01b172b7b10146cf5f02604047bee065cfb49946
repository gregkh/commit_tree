GFS2: Ensure workqueue is scheduled after noexp request

This patch closes a small timing window whereby a request to hold the
transaction glock can get stuck. The problem is that after the DLM has
granted the lock, it can get into a state whereby it doesn't transition
the glock to a held state, due to not having requeued the glock state
machine to finish the transition.
