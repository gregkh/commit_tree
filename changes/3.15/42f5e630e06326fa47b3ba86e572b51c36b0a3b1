[media] rc-core: do not change 32bit NEC scancode format for now

This reverts 18bc17448147e93f31cc9b1a83be49f1224657b2 and changes
the code at img-ir-nec.c to use the order used by the other NEC decoders.

The original patch ignored the fact that NEC32 scancodes are generated not
only in the NEC raw decoder but also directly in some drivers. Whichever
approach is chosen it should be consistent across drivers and this patch
needs more discussion.

Furthermore, I'm convinced that we have to stop playing games trying to
decipher the "meaning" of NEC scancodes (what's the customer/vendor/address,
which byte is the MSB, etc).
