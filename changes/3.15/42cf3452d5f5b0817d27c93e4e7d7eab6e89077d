jbd2: calculate statistics without holding j_state_lock and j_list_lock

The two hottest locks, and thus the biggest scalability bottlenecks,
in the jbd2 layer, are the j_list_lock and j_state_lock.  This has
inspired some people to do some truly unnatural things[1].

We don't need to be holding both j_state_lock and j_list_lock while
calculating the journal statistics, so move those calculations to the
very end of jbd2_journal_commit_transaction.
