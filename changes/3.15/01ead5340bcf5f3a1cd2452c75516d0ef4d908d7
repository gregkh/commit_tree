mm/compaction: do not call suitable_migration_target() on every page

suitable_migration_target() checks that pageblock is suitable for
migration target.  In isolate_freepages_block(), it is called on every
page and this is inefficient.  So make it called once per pageblock.

suitable_migration_target() also checks if page is highorder or not, but
it's criteria for highorder is pageblock order.  So calling it once
within pageblock range has no problem.
