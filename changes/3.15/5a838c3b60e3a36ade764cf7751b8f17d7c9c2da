percpu: make pcpu_alloc_chunk() use pcpu_mem_free() instead of kfree()

pcpu_chunk_struct_size = sizeof(struct pcpu_chunk) +
	BITS_TO_LONGS(pcpu_unit_pages) * sizeof(unsigned long)

It hardly could be ever bigger than PAGE_SIZE even for large-scale machine,
but for consistency with its couterpart pcpu_mem_zalloc(),
use pcpu_mem_free() instead.

Commit b4916cb17c26 ("percpu: make pcpu_free_chunk() use
pcpu_mem_free() instead of kfree()") addressed this problem, but
missed this one.
