ARM: ks8695/og: make PCI setup conditional

The 'og' machine tries to always initialized the PCI code, but that
may be disabled in Kconfig, leading to a build error.

This patch changes the code to use the same Kconfig symbol to decide
about calling the ks8695_init_pci function at build time that we
use to decide about building the ks8695 PCI support.
