tick-sched: Don't call update_wall_time() when delta is lesser than tick_period

In tick_do_update_jiffies64() we are processing ticks only if delta is
greater than tick_period. This is what we are supposed to do here and
it broke a bit with this patch:

commit 47a1b796 (tick/timekeeping: Call update_wall_time outside the
jiffies lock)

With above patch, we might end up calling update_wall_time() even if
delta is found to be smaller that tick_period. Fix this by returning
when the delta is less than tick period.

[ tglx: Made it a 3 liner and massaged changelog ]
