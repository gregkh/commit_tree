HID: multitouch: remove registered devices with default behavior

The default multitouch protocol class in use since the kernel v3.9 is
working quite well. Since its inclusion, the only devices we had to tweak
were those who really need quirks (GeneralTouch, FocalTech and Wistron,
the 3 of them are Win 7 certified ones).
The flow of new unhandled devices has stopped, which is great and I think
it's time to reduce the list of registered device.

This commit removes only the registration in the kernel of devices that
use the class MT_CLS_DEFAULT, or that can use it. By that, I mean that I
checked all the recordings I have, and the produced input device and
events are the same before and after applying the patch.

This gives two benefits:
- remove a bunch of lines of codes
- prevent bad handling of existing registered devices which are using a
different protocol while using the same VID/PID (I got the case of a
Quanta 3008 recently).

I also removed the associated classes (MT_CLS*). I kept their #define in
case people use the new_id sysfs node with a non standard class (their
should be really few people now, but we never now). This is why there
are /* reserved .... */.

Last, I add a comment on top of mt_devices[] definition to remember people
(and myself) not to include devices for the beauty of it.

To people still trying to add devices with the default class:
"""
Guys, try out your device under a kernel greater or equal to v3.9. If it
works, you are all set. Adding your VID/PID to the kernel only brings us
overload and you won't get anything from it _because_ even a backport of
this shiny patch will _not_ make the device work under 3.0, 3.2, 3.4 or
even 3.8.
So if it works, it works.
If it does not work, then yes, submit a patch or call for help.
In any cases, if you want me to do regression tests, I'd be happy to
get some traces of your device. But I won't patch the kernel if it works.
