ARM: 8033/1: fix big endian __pv_phys_pfn_offset size related issue

Fix e26a9e00afc482b971afcaef1db8c9034d4d6d7c 'ARM: Better
virt_to_page() handling' replaced __pv_phys_offset with
__pv_phys_pfn_offset. Also note that size of __pv_phys_offset
was quad but size of __pv_phys_pfn_offset is word. Instruction
that used to update __pv_phys_offset which address is in r6
had to update low word of __pv_phys_offset so it used #LOW_OFFSET
macro for store offset. Now when size of __pv_phys_pfn_offset is
word, no difference between little endian and big endian should
exist - i.e no offset should be used when __pv_phys_pfn_offset
is stored.

Note that for little endian image proposed change is noop,
since in little endian case #LOW_OFFSET is defined 0 anyway.
