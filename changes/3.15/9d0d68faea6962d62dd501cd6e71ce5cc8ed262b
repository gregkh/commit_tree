team: fix mtu setting

Now it is not possible to set mtu to team device which has a port
enslaved to it. The reason is that when team_change_mtu() calls
dev_set_mtu() for port device, notificator for NETDEV_PRECHANGEMTU
event is called and team_device_event() returns NOTIFY_BAD forbidding
the change. So fix this by returning NOTIFY_DONE here in case team is
changing mtu in team_change_mtu().
