phy: fix kernel oops in phy_lookup()

The kernel oopses in phy_lookup() due to 'phy->init_data' being NULL if we
register PHYs from a device tree probing driver and then call phy_get() on a
device that has no representation in the device tree (e.g. a PCI device).
Checking the pointer before dereferening it and skipping an interation if
it's NULL prevents this kernel oops.
