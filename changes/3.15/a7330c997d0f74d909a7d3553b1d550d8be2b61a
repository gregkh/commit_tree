asmlinkage Make __stack_chk_failed and memcmp visible

In LTO symbols implicitely referenced by the compiler need
to be visible. Earlier these symbols were visible implicitely
from being exported, but we disabled implicit visibility fo
 EXPORTs when modules are disabled to improve code size. So
now these symbols have to be marked visible explicitely.

Do this for __stack_chk_fail (with stack protector)
and memcmp.
