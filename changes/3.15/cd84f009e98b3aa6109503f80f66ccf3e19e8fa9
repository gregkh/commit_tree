usb: chipidea: coordinate usb phy initialization for different phy type

For internal PHY (like UTMI), the phy clock may from internal pll,
it is on/off on the fly, the access PORTSC.PTS will hang without
phy clock. So, the usb_phy_init which will open phy clock needs to
be called before hw_phymode_configure.

For external PHY (like ulpi), it needs to configure portsc.pts before
visit viewport, or the viewport can't be visited. so phy_phymode_configure
needs to be called before usb_phy_init.

It may not the best solution, but it can work for all situations.
