slab: fix wrongly used macro

commit 'slab: restrict the number of objects in a slab' uses
__builtin_constant_p() on #if macro. It is wrong usage of builtin
function, but it is compiled on x86 without any problem, so I can't
find it before 0 day build system find it.

This commit fixes the situation by using KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE, instead of
KMALLOC_SHIFT_LOW. KMALLOC_SHIFT_LOW is parsed to ilog2() on some
architecture and this ilog2() uses __builtin_constant_p() and results in
the problem. This problem would disappear by using KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE,
since it is just constant.
