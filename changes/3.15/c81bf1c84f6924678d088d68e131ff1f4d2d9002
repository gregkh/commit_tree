This patch fixes performance regression of dbench reported by
Alex <hbx7d@yandex.com>.

This issue was revealed by Phoronix tests results:

It turns out that we need to assign WRITE_SYNC to the node writes, if
fsync is triggered.

The performance numbers are like below, which is measured by Alex.
1. 355MB/s       ext4
2. 225MB/s       f2fs : WRITE for node writes
3. 525MB/s       f2fs : WRITE_SYNC for node writes
