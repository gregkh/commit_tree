Bluetooth: Fix sending wrong store hint for new long term keys

The long term keys should only be stored when they belong to an
indentity address. The identity address can either be a public
address or a random static address.

For all other addresses (unresovable or resolvable) tell userspace
that the long term key is not persistent.
