ASoC: fsl_esai: Set PCRC and PRRC registers at the end of hw_params()

According to Reference Manual -- ESAI Initialization chapter, as the
standard procedure of ESAI personal reset, the PCRC and PRRC registers
should be remained in its reset value and then configured after T/RCCR
and T/RCR configurations's done but before TE/RE's enabling.

So this patch moves PCRC and PRRC settings to the end of hw_params().
