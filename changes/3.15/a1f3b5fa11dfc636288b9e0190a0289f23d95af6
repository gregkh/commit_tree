ALSA: hda - add headset mic detect quirks for three Dell laptops

When we plug a 3-ring headset on the Dell machines (VID: 0x10ec0255,
SID: 0x1028065c; VID: 0x10ec0255, SID: 0x10280680; VID: 0x10ec0292,
SID: 0x10280684), the headset mic can't be detected, after apply this
patch, the headset mic can work well.

And on the machine with SID 0x10280684, and the Lineout and external
microphone should be routed to docking, this patch also fix this
problem.
