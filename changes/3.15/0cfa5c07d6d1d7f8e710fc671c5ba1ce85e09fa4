tcp: fix cwnd undo on DSACK in F-RTO

This bug is discovered by an recent F-RTO issue on tcpm list
https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tcpm/current/msg08794.html

The bug is that currently F-RTO does not use DSACK to undo cwnd in
certain cases: upon receiving an ACK after the RTO retransmission in
F-RTO, and the ACK has DSACK indicating the retransmission is spurious,
the sender only calls tcp_try_undo_loss() if some never retransmisted
data is sacked (FLAG_ORIG_DATA_SACKED).

The correct behavior is to unconditionally call tcp_try_undo_loss so
the DSACK information is used properly to undo the cwnd reduction.
