ALSA: usb-audio: Fix deadlocks at resuming

The recent addition of the USB audio mixer suspend/resume may lead to
deadlocks when the driver tries to call usb_autopm_get_interface()
recursively, since the function tries to sync with the finish of the
other calls.  For avoiding it, introduce a flag indicating the resume
operation and avoids the recursive usb_autopm_get_interface() calls
during the resume.
