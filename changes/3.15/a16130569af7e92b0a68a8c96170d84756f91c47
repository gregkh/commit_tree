w1: increase w1_max_slave_count, allow write access

w1_max_slave_count is only used to abort the search early
or take a fast search (when 1), so there isn't any reason to not allow
it to be updated through sysfs.  Memory is not allocated based on
the current value and 10 is a rather low base number, increasing to
64, and printing a message the first time the count is reached and
there were more devices to discover to let the user know why not
all the devices were found.
