ledtrig-cpu: Handle CPU hot(un)plugging

When CPU is hot(un)plugged, no syscore notification is being
generated, nor is cpuidle involved. This leaves the CPU LED
turned on, because the dying thread is doing some work (LED on)
and than it is... well, dying (LED still on :-)

Added notifier block for hot(un)plugging operations, generating
existing trigger events.
