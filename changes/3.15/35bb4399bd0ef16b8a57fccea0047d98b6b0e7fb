tracing: Move event storage for array from macro to standalone function

The code that shows array fields for events is defined for all events.
This can add up quite a bit when you have over 500 events.

By making helper functions in the core kernel to do the work
instead, we can shrink the size of the kernel down a bit.

With a kernel configured with 502 events, the change in size was:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
12990946        1913568 9785344 24689858        178bcc2 /tmp/vmlinux
12987390        1913504 9785344 24686238        178ae9e /tmp/vmlinux.patched

That's a total of 3556 bytes, which comes down to 7 bytes per event.
Although it's not much, this code is just called at initialization of
the events.
