mm/compaction: disallow high-order page for migration target

Purpose of compaction is to get a high order page.  Currently, if we
find high-order page while searching migration target page, we break it
to order-0 pages and use them as migration target.  It is contrary to
purpose of compaction, so disallow high-order page to be used for
migration target.

Additionally, clean-up logic in suitable_migration_target() to simplify
the code.  There is no functional changes from this clean-up.
