mwifiex: fix hung task on command timeout

Sometimes when command timeout occurs due to a firmware or
hardware bug, there may be some synchronous commands in command
queue. These commands are never downloaded to firmware causing
hung task warnings. This patch replaces wait_event_interruptible
call with wait_event_interruptible_timeout to fix the issue.
