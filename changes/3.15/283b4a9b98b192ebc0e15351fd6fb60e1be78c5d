[SCSI] hpsa: add ioaccell mode 1 RAID offload support.

This enables sending i/o's destined for RAID logical drives
which can be serviced by a single physical disk down a different,
faster i/o path directly to physical drives for certain logical
volumes on SSDs bypassing the Smart Array RAID stack for a
performance improvement.
