arch/powerpc: Use RCU_INIT_POINTER(x, NULL) in platforms/cell/spu_syscalls.c

Here rcu_assign_pointer() is ensuring that the
initialization of a structure is carried out before storing a pointer
to that structure.
So, rcu_assign_pointer(p, NULL) can always safely be converted to
RCU_INIT_POINTER(p, NULL).
