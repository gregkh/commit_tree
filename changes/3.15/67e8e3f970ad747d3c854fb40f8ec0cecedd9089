drm/radeon: track memory statistics about VRAM and GTT usage and buffer moves v2

The statistics are:
- VRAM usage in bytes
- GTT usage in bytes
- number of bytes moved by TTM

The last one is actually a counter, so you need to sample it before and after
command submission and take the difference.

This is useful for finding performance bottlenecks. Userspace queries are
also added.

v2: use atomic64_t
