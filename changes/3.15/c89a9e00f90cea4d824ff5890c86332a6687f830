i40evf: don't shut down admin queue on error

If the driver encounters an error while communicating with the PF
driver,  don't just shut down the admin queue unconditionally. The PF
may be delayed, and shutting down the admin queue causes it to fail
completely. If this happens, the VF will never complete initialization.
