staging: rtl8192u: make in ieee80211/rtl819x_HTProc.c some local functions static

Make some local functions static.

These are the local functions that were made static:

IsHTHalfNmode40Bandwidth, IsHTHalfNmodeSGI, HTIOTPeerDetermine,
HTIOTActIsDisableMCS14, HTIOTActIsDisableMCS15,
HTIOTActIsDisableMCSTwoSpatialStream, HTIOTActIsDisableEDCATurbo,
HTIOTActIsMgntUseCCK6M, HTIOTActIsCCDFsync, HT_PickMCSRate,
HTFilterMCSRate, HTUseDefaultSetting

Fix the following sparse warnings in ieee80211/rtl819x_HTProc.c
