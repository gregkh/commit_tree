drm/i915: get power domain in case the BIOS enabled eDP VDD

If I unplug the eDP monitor, the BIOS of my machine will enable the
VDD bit, then when the driver loads it will think VDD is enabled. It
will detect that the eDP is not enabled and return false from
intel_edp_init_connector. This will trigger a call to
edp_panel_vdd_off_sync(), which trigger a WARN saying that the
refcount of the power domain is less than zero.

The problem happens because the driver gets a refcount whenever it
enables the VDD bit, and puts the refcount whenever it disables the
VDD bit. But on this case, the BIOS enabled VDD, so all we do is to
call put() without calling get() first, so the code added is there to
make sure we always have the get() in case the BIOS enabled the bit.

This regression was introduced in
