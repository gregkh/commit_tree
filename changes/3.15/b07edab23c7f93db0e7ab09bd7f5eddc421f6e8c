s390/compat: convert system call wrappers to C part 01

Introduce a new compat_wrap.c file which contains the s390 specific compat
system call wrappers.
The s390 specific system call wrappers only perform sign, zero and pointer
conversion of system call arguments before actually calling the non-compat
system call.

Therefore introduce COMPAT_SYSCALL_WRAPx macros which generate C code that
is nearly identical to the assembly code. This has the advantage that the
compile will generate correct code, and we avoid the frequent copy-paste
errors seen in the compat_wrapper.S file.
