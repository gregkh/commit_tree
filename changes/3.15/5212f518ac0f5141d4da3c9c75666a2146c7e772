rtlwifi: btcoexist: remove undefined Kconfig macros

There are references to four undefined Kconfig macros in the code.
Commit 8542373dccd2 ("Staging: rtl8812ae: remove undefined Kconfig
macros") removed identical references from that staging driver, but
they resurfaced in rtlwifi. Remove these again as the checks for them
still will always evaluate to false.
