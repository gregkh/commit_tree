memcg: do not replicate get_mem_cgroup_from_mm in __mem_cgroup_try_charge

__mem_cgroup_try_charge duplicates get_mem_cgroup_from_mm for charges
which came without a memcg.  The only reason seems to be a tiny
optimization when css_tryget is not called if the charge can be consumed
from the stock.  Nevertheless css_tryget is very cheap since it has been
reworked to use per-cpu counting so this optimization doesn't give us
anything these days.

So let's drop the code duplication so that the code is more readable.
