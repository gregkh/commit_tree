tracing/uprobes: Support ftrace_event_file base multibuffer

Support multi-buffer on uprobe-based dynamic events by
using ftrace_event_file.

This patch is based kprobe-based dynamic events multibuffer
support work initially, commited by Masami(commit 41a7dd420c),
but revised as below:

Oleg changed the kprobe-based multibuffer design from
array-pointers of ftrace_event_file into simple list,
so this patch also change to the list design.

rcu_read_lock/unlock added into uprobe_trace_func/uretprobe_trace_func,
to synchronize with ftrace_event_file list add and delete.

Even though we allow multi-uprobes instances now,
but TP_FLAG_PROFILE/TP_FLAG_TRACE are still mutually exclusive
in probe_event_enable currently, this means we cannot allow
one user is using uprobe-tracer, and another user is using
perf-probe on same uprobe concurrently.
(Perhaps this will be fix in future, kprobe don't have this
limitation now)
