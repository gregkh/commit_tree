Bluetooth: Release rfcomm_dev only once

No logic prevents an rfcomm_dev from being released multiple
times. For example, if the rfcomm_dev ref count is large due
to pending tx, then multiple RFCOMMRELEASEDEV ioctls may
mistakenly release the rfcomm_dev too many times. Note that
concurrent ioctls are not required to create this condition.

Introduce RFCOMM_DEV_RELEASED status bit which guarantees the
rfcomm_dev can only be released once.

NB: Since the flags are exported to userspace, introduce the status
field to track state for which userspace should not be aware.
