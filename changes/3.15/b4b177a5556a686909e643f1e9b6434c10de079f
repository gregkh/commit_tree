mac80211: fix on-channel remain-on-channel

Jouni reported that if a remain-on-channel was active on the
same channel as the current operating channel, then the ROC
would start, but any frames transmitted using mgmt-tx on the
same channel would get delayed until after the ROC.

The reason for this is that the ROC starts, but doesn't have
any handling for "remain on the same channel", so it stops
the interface queues. The later mgmt-tx then puts the frame
on the interface queues (since it's on the current operating
channel) and thus they get delayed until after the ROC.

To fix this, add some logic to handle remaining on the same
channel specially and not stop the queues etc. in this case.
This not only fixes the bug but also improves behaviour in
this case as data frames etc. can continue to flow.
