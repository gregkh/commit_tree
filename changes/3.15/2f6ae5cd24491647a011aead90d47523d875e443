[SCSI] hpsa: only allow REQ_TYPE_FS to use fast path

When commands sent down the "fast path" fail, they must be re-tried down the
normal RAID path.  We do this by kicking i/o's back to the scsi mid layer with
a DID_SOFT_ERROR status, which causes them to be retried.  This won't work for
SG_IO's and other non REQ_TYPE_FS i/o's which could get kicked all the way back
to the application, which may have no idea that the command needs resubmitting
and likely no way to resubmit it in such a way the that driver can recognize it
as a resubmit and send it down the normal RAID path.  So we just always send
non REQ_TYPE_FS i/o's down the normal RAID path, never down the "fast path".
