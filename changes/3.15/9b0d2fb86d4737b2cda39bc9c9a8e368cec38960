perf ui/stdio: Fix invalid output on event group report

When some of group member has 0 overhead, it printed previous percentage
instead of 0.00%.  It's because passing integer 0 as a percent rather
than double 0.0 so the remaining bits came from garbage.  The TUI and
GTK don't have this problem since they pass 0.0.
