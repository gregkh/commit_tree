PCI: Log IDE resource quirk in dmesg

Make a note in dmesg when we overwrite legacy IDE BAR info.  We previously
logged something like this:

  pci 0000:00:1f.1: reg 0x10: [io  0x0000-0x0007]

and then silently overwrote the resource.  There's an example in the
bugzilla below.  This doesn't fix the bugzilla; it just makes what's going
on more obvious.

No functional change; merely adds some dev_info() calls.
