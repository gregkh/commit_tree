x86: always define BUG() and HAVE_ARCH_BUG, even with !CONFIG_BUG

This ensures that BUG() always has a definition that causes a trap (via
an undefined instruction), and that the compiler still recognizes the
code following BUG() as unreachable, avoiding warnings that would
otherwise appear (such as on non-void functions that don't return a
value after BUG()).

In addition to saving a few bytes over the generic infinite-loop
implementation, this implementation traps rather than looping, which
potentially allows for better error-recovery behavior (such as by
rebooting).
