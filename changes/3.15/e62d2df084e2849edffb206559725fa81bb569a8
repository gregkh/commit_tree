net: ptp: use sk_unattached_filter_create() for BPF

This patch migrates an open-coded sk_run_filter() implementation with
proper use of the BPF API, that is, sk_unattached_filter_create(). This
migration is needed, as we will be internally transforming the filter
to a different representation, and therefore needs to be decoupled.

It is okay to do so as skb_timestamping_init() is called during
initialization of the network stack in core initcall via sock_init().
This would effectively also allow for PTP filters to be jit compiled if
bpf_jit_enable is set.

For better readability, there are also some newlines introduced, also
ptp_classify.h is only in kernel space.

Joint work with Alexei Starovoitov.
