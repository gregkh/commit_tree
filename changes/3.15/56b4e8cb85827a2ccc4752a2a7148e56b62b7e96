zram: use scnprintf() in attrs show() methods

sysfs.txt documentation lists the following requirements:

 - The buffer will always be PAGE_SIZE bytes in length. On i386, this
   is 4096.

 - show() methods should return the number of bytes printed into the
   buffer. This is the return value of scnprintf().

 - show() should always use scnprintf().

Use scnprintf() in show() functions.
