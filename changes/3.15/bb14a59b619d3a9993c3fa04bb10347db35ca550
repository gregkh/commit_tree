Btrfs: use signed integer instead of unsigned long integer for log transid

The log trans id is initialized to be 0 every time we create a log tree,
and the log tree need be re-created after a new transaction is started,
it means the log trans id is unlikely to be a huge number, so we can use
signed integer instead of unsigned long integer to save a bit space.
