Bluetooth: Verify dlci not in use before rfcomm_dev create

Only one session/channel combination may be in use at any one
time. However, the failure does not occur until the tty is
opened (in rfcomm_dlc_open()).

Because these settings are actually bound at rfcomm device
creation (via RFCOMMCREATEDEV ioctl), validate and fail before
creating the rfcomm tty device.
