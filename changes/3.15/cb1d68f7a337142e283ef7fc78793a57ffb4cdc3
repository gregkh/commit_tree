Bluetooth: Track LE initiator and responder address information

For SMP we need the local and remote addresses (and their types) that
were used to establish the connection. These may be different from the
Identity Addresses or even the current RPA. To guarantee that we have
this information available and it is correct track these values
separately from the very beginning of the connection.

For outgoing connections we set the values as soon as we get a
successful command status for HCI_LE_Create_Connection (for which the
patch adds a command status handler function) and for incoming
connections as soon as we get a LE Connection Complete HCI event.
