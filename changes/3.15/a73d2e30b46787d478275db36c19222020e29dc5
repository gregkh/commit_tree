pinctrl: as3722: fix handling of GPIO invert bit

The AS3722_GPIO_INV bit will always be blindly overwritten by
as3722_pinctrl_gpio_set_direction() and will be ignored when
setting the value of the GPIO in as3722_gpio_set() since the
enable_gpio_invert flag is never set.  This will cause an
initially inverted GPIO to toggle when requested as an output,
which could be problematic if, for example, the GPIO controls
a critical regulator.

Instead of setting up the enable_gpio_invert flag, just leave
the invert bit alone and check it before setting the GPIO value.
