ext4: atomically set inode->i_flags in ext4_set_inode_flags()

Use cmpxchg() to atomically set i_flags instead of clearing out the
S_IMMUTABLE, S_APPEND, etc. flags and then setting them from the
EXT4_IMMUTABLE_FL, EXT4_APPEND_FL flags, since this opens up a race
where an immutable file has the immutable flag cleared for a brief
window of time.
