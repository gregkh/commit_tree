[SCSI] Add EVPD page 0x83 and 0x80 to sysfs

EVPD page 0x83 is used to uniquely identify the device.
So instead of having each and every program issue a separate
SG_IO call to retrieve this information it does make far more
sense to display it in sysfs.

Some older devices (most notably tapes) will only report reliable
information in page 0x80 (Unit Serial Number). So export this
in the sysfs attribute 'vpd_pg80'.
