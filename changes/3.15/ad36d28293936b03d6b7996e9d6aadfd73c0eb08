pid: get pid_t ppid of task in init_pid_ns

Added the functions task_ppid_nr_ns() and task_ppid_nr() to abstract the lookup
of the PPID (real_parent's pid_t) of a process, including rcu locking, in the
arbitrary and init_pid_ns.
This provides an alternative to sys_getppid(), which is relative to the child
process' pid namespace.
