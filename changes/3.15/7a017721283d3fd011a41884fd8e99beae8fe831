audit: Add CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_AUDITSYSCALL

Currently AUDITSYSCALL has a long list of architecture depencency:
       depends on AUDIT && (X86 || PARISC || PPC || S390 || IA64 || UML ||
		SPARC64 || SUPERH || (ARM && AEABI && !OABI_COMPAT) || ALPHA)
The purpose of this patch is to replace it with HAVE_ARCH_AUDITSYSCALL
for simplicity.
