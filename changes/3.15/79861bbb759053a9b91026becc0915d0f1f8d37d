ASoC: rsnd: fix clock prepare/unprepare

As with the previous commit, before a clock can be used it must be prepared
for use. Change from clk_enable() and clk_disable() to the versions of the
calls which also prepare and un-prepare the clocks.

Will fix warnings from the clock code when this is used.
