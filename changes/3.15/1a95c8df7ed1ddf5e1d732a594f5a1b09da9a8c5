iwlwifi: mvm: configure seq_num to D0i3

Configure the QoS counters when entering D0i3.

The fw might use them later when performing protocol
offloading (we'll update the the counters back on
d0i3 exit in a following patch).

Non-QoS counter is handled internally in the fw, so
no need to configure it.

Also, add support for a new version of WOWLAN_CONFIG_CMD
