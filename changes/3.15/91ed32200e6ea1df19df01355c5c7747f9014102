ARM: mvebu: switch the Armada XP GP to use internal registers at 0xf1000000

Marvell has now provided bootloaders that are Device Tree capable for
the Armada XP GP board, and that also remap the internal register base
address to 0xf1000000. In addition, the bootloader now sets the MBus
Window base address to 0xf0000000, which allows to use much more RAM
in the last GB of RAM before the 4 GB limit (the entire space from
0xC0000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF was not usable due to being used for I/O, not
only the space from 0xF0000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF is used for I/O).

Therefore this commit:

 * Updates the memory->reg Device Tree property with the fact that in
   the first bank of RAM, memory up to 0xf0000000 can be used.

 * Updates the soc->ranges Device Tree property with the fact that the
   internal registers are now mapped at 0xf1000000.
