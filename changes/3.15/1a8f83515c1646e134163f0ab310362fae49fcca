ACPI / LPSS: Support for device latency tolerance PM QoS

Add a new routine, acpi_lpss_set_ltr(), for setting latency tolerance
values for LPSS devices having LTR (Latency Tolerance Reporting)
registers.  Add .bind()/.unbind() callbacks to lpss_handler to set
the LPSS devices' power.set_latency_tolerance callback pointers to
acpi_lpss_set_ltr() during device addition and to clear them on
device removal, respectively.

That will cause the device latency tolerance PM QoS to work for
the devices in question as documented.

This changeset includes a fix from Mika Westerberg.
