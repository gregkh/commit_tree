rtlwifi: rtl8192se: Fix regression due to commit 1bf4bbb

Beginning with kernel 3.13, this driver fails on some systems. The problem
was bisected to:

Commit 1bf4bbb4024dcdab5e57634dd8ae1072d42a53ac
Author: Felix Fietkau <nbd@openwrt.org>
Title: mac80211: send control port protocol frames to the VO queue

There is noting wrong with the above commit. The regression occurs because
V0 queue on RTL8192SE cards uses priority 6, not the usual 7. The fix is to
modify the rtl8192se routine that sets the correct transmit queue.
