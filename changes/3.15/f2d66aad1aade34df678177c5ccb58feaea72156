imx-drm: simplify setup of panel format

The encoder format passed into imx_drm_crtc_panel_format*() is the
encoder format used for DRM in most cases; the HDMI encoder sets
this to none, but this is incorrect, it should be TMDS.

Since this is the case, we can pass the drm_encoder structure
directly into this function and use the supplied fields there to
configure the CRTC.
