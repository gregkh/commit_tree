afs: don't use PREPARE_WORK

PREPARE_[DELAYED_]WORK() are being phased out.  They have few users
and a nasty surprise in terms of reentrancy guarantee as workqueue
considers work items to be different if they don't have the same work
function.

afs_call->async_work is multiplexed with multiple work functions.
Introduce afs_async_workfn() which invokes afs_call->async_workfn and
always use it as the work function and update the users to set the
->async_workfn field instead of overriding the work function using
PREPARE_WORK().

It would probably be best to route this with other related updates
through the workqueue tree.

Compile tested.
