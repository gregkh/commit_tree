IB/mad: Check and handle potential DMA mapping errors

Running with DMA_API_DEBUG enabled and not checking for DMA mapping
errors triggers a kernel stack trace with "DMA-API: device driver
failed to check map error" message.  Add these checks to the MAD
module, both to be be more robust and also eliminate these
false-positive stack traces.
