perpcu: fold pcpu_split_block() into the only caller

... and simplify the results a bit.  Makes the next step easier
to deal with - we will be changing the data representation for
chunk->map[] and it's easier to do if the code in question is
not split between pcpu_alloc_area() and pcpu_split_block().
