xen-netback: Use skb->cb for pending_idx

Storing the pending_idx at the first byte of the linear buffer never looked
good, skb->cb is a more proper place for this. It also prevents the header to
be directly grant copied there, and we don't have the pending_idx after we
copied the header here, so it's time to change it.
It also introduces helpers for the RX side
