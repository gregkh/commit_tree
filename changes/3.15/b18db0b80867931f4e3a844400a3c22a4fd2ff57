KVM guest: Make pv trampoline code executable

Our PV guest patching code assembles chunks of instructions on the fly when it
encounters more complicated instructions to hijack. These instructions need
to live in a section that we don't mark as non-executable, as otherwise we
fault when jumping there.

Right now we put it into the .bss section where it automatically gets marked
as non-executable. Add a check to the NX setting function to ensure that we
leave these particular pages executable.
