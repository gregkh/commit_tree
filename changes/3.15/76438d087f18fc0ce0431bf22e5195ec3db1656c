[SCSI] hpsa: poll controller to detect device change event

For shared SAS configurations, hosts need to poll Smart Arrays
periodically in order to be able to detect configuration changes
such as logical drives being added or removed from remote hosts.
A register on the controller indicates when such events have
occurred, and the driver polls the register via a workqueue
and kicks off a rescan of devices if such an event is detected.
Additionally, changes to logical drive raid offload eligibility
are autodetected in this way.
