staging: comedi: pcl818: tidy up dma buffer allocation

This driver uses 2 buffers for DMA. Refactor the buffer allocation to
use a for loop to remove code duplication. Remove the dev_err() messages
when __get_dma_pages() fails and change the errno returned from -EBUSY
to -ENOMEM.

Both buffers are the same size so replace the 'dmapages' and 'hwdmasize'
arrays in the private data with variables to save a bit of space.
