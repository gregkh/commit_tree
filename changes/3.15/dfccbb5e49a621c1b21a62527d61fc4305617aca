wait: fix reparent_leader() vs EXIT_DEAD->EXIT_ZOMBIE race

wait_task_zombie() first does EXIT_ZOMBIE->EXIT_DEAD transition and
drops tasklist_lock.  If this task is not the natural child and it is
traced, we change its state back to EXIT_ZOMBIE for ->real_parent.

The last transition is racy, this is even documented in 50b8d257486a
"ptrace: partially fix the do_wait(WEXITED) vs EXIT_DEAD->EXIT_ZOMBIE
race".  wait_consider_task() tries to detect this transition and clear
->notask_error but we can't rely on ptrace_reparented(), debugger can
exit and do ptrace_unlink() before its sub-thread sets EXIT_ZOMBIE.

And there is another problem which were missed before: this transition
can also race with reparent_leader() which doesn't reset >exit_signal if
EXIT_DEAD, assuming that this task must be reaped by someone else.  So
the tracee can be re-parented with ->exit_signal != SIGCHLD, and if
/sbin/init doesn't use __WALL it becomes unreapable.

Change reparent_leader() to update ->exit_signal even if EXIT_DEAD.
Note: this is the simple temporary hack for -stable, it doesn't try to
solve all problems, it will be reverted by the next changes.
