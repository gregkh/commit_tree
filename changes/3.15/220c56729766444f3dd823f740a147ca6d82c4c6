KVM: nVMX: Do not inject NMI vmexits when L2 has a pending interrupt

According to SDM 27.2.3, IDT vectoring information will not be valid on
vmexits caused by external NMIs. So we have to avoid creating such
scenarios by delaying EXIT_REASON_EXCEPTION_NMI injection as long as we
have a pending interrupt because that one would be migrated to L1's IDT
vectoring info on nested exit.
