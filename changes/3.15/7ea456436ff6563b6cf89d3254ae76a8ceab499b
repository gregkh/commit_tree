pinctrl: vt8500: Ensure value reg is updated when setting direction

Current code only touches the direction register when setting direction
to output, which breaks logic like

echo high > /sys/class/gpio/gpio0/direction

which is expected to also set the value. This patch also adds a call
to update the value register when setting direction to output.
