iwlwifi: mvm: change the format of the SRAM dump

As a debug tool, we dump the SRAM from the device when an
error occurs. The main users of this want it in a different
format, so change the format to suit their needs.
Also - add a short delay between the prints to make sure
that the user space logger can catch up.

This happens only when the firmware asserts, and only when
fw_restart is set to 0 which is typically a testing
configuration.
