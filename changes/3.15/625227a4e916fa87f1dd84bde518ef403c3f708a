spi: sirf: set SPI controller in RISC IO chipselect mode

SPI bitbang supply "chipselect" interface for change chip-select line
, in the SiRFSoC SPI controller, we need to enable "SPI_CS_IO_MODE",
otherwise, spi_sirfsoc_chipselect() has no effect.
now the driver is working is because SPI controller will control CS
automatically without SPI_CS_IO_MODE. this patch makes the CS controller
really controlled by software.
