ARM: tegra: fix board DT pinmux setup

Neither Tegra114 nor Tegra124 allow "low power mode" to be configured
on SDIO1 or SDIO3 drive groups. Remove the attempt to configure that
option from the Dalmore and Venice2 DTs.

The Venice2 DT contained duplicate configurations for most sdmmc1_*
pins. Remove the duplicate pins from one of the nodes, and fix the
configuration since the remaining clk pin is output-only.
