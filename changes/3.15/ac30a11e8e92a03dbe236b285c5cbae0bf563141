ARM: KVM: introduce per-vcpu HYP Configuration Register

So far, KVM/ARM used a fixed HCR configuration per guest, except for
the VI/VF/VA bits to control the interrupt in absence of VGIC.

With the upcoming need to dynamically reconfigure trapping, it becomes
necessary to allow the HCR to be changed on a per-vcpu basis.

The fix here is to mimic what KVM/arm64 already does: a per vcpu HCR
field, initialized at setup time.
