perf kvm: Fix 'Min time' counting in report command

Every event in the perf-kvm has a 'stats' structure, which contains
max/min/average/etc times of handling this event.
The problem is that the 'perf-kvm stat report' command always shows
that 'min time' is 0us for every event. Example:

 # perf kvm stat report

 Analyze events for all VCPUs:

    VM-EXIT    Samples  Samples%     Time%   Min Time   Max Time Avg time
  [..]
  0xB2 MSCH         12     0.07%     0.00%        0us        8us 7.31us ( +-   2.11% )
  0xB2 CHSC         12     0.07%     0.00%        0us       18us 9.39us ( +-   9.49% )
  0xB2 STPX          8     0.05%     0.00%        0us        2us 1.88us ( +-   7.18% )
  0xB2 STSI          7     0.04%     0.00%        0us       44us 16.49us ( +-  38.20% )
  [..]

This happens because the 'stats' structure is not initialized and
stats->min equals to 0. Lets initialize the structure for every
event after its allocation using init_stats() function. This initializes
stats->min to -1 and makes 'Min time' statistics counting work:

 # perf kvm stat report

 Analyze events for all VCPUs:

    VM-EXIT    Samples  Samples%     Time%   Min Time   Max Time Avg time
  [..]
  0xB2 MSCH         12     0.07%     0.00%        6us        8us 7.31us ( +-   2.11% )
  0xB2 CHSC         12     0.07%     0.00%        7us       18us 9.39us ( +-   9.49% )
  0xB2 STPX          8     0.05%     0.00%        1us        2us 1.88us ( +-   7.18% )
  0xB2 STSI          7     0.04%     0.00%        1us       44us 16.49us ( +-  38.20% )
