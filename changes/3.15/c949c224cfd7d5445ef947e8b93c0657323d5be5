Bluetooth: Fix RFCOMM tty teardown race

RFCOMM tty device teardown can race with new tty device registration
for the same device id:

CPU 0                           | CPU 1
rfcomm_dev_add                  | rfcomm_dev_destruct
                                |   spin_lock
                                |   list_del   <== dev_id no longer used
                                |   spin_unlock
  spin_lock                     |     .
  [search rfcomm_dev_list]      |     .
  [dev_id not in use]           |     .
  [initialize new rfcomm_dev]   |     .
  spin_unlock                   |     .
                                |     .
  tty_port_register_device      |   tty_unregister_device

Don't remove rfcomm_dev from the device list until after tty device
unregistration has completed.
