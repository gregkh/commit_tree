drivers: of: add initialization code for static reserved memory

This patch adds support for static (defined by 'reg' property) reserved
memory regions declared in device tree.

Memory blocks can be reliably reserved only during early boot. This must
happen before the whole memory management subsystem is initialized,
because we need to ensure that the given contiguous blocks are not yet
allocated by kernel. Also it must happen before kernel mappings for the
whole low memory are created, to ensure that there will be no mappings
(for reserved blocks). Typically, all this happens before device tree
structures are unflattened, so we need to get reserved memory layout
directly from fdt.
