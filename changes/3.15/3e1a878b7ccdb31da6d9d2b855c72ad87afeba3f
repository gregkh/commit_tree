x86/smpboot: Initialize secondary CPU only if master CPU will wait for it

Hang is observed on virtual machines during CPU hotplug,
especially in big guests with many CPUs. (It reproducible
more often if host is over-committed).

It happens because master CPU gives up waiting on
secondary CPU and allows it to run wild. As result
AP causes locking or crashing system. For example
as described here:

   https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/3/6/257

If master CPU have sent STARTUP IPI successfully,
and AP signalled to master CPU that it's ready
to start initialization, make master CPU wait
indefinitely till AP is onlined.
To ensure that AP won't ever run wild, make it
wait at early startup till master CPU confirms its
intention to wait for AP. If AP doesn't respond in 10
seconds, the master CPU will timeout and cancel
AP onlining.
