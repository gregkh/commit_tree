vsprintf: Add support for IORESOURCE_UNSET in %pR

Sometimes we have a struct resource where we know the type (MEM/IO/etc.)
and the size, but we haven't assigned address space for it.  The
IORESOURCE_UNSET flag is a way to indicate this situation.  For these
"unset" resources, the start address is meaningless, so print only the
size, e.g.,

  - pci 0000:0c:00.0: reg 184: [mem 0x00000000-0x00001fff 64bit]
  + pci 0000:0c:00.0: reg 184: [mem size 0x2000 64bit]

For %pr (printing with raw flags), we still print the address range,
because %pr is mostly used for debugging anyway.

Thanks to Fengguang Wu <fengguang.wu@intel.com> for suggesting
resource_size().
