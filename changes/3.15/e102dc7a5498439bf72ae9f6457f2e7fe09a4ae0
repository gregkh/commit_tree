rtc: mv: reset date if after year 2038

Dates after January, 19th 2038 are badly handled by userspace due to
the time being stored on 32 bits. This causes issues on some Marvell
platform on which the RTC is initialized by default to a date that's
beyond 2038, causing a really weird behavior of the RTC.

In order to avoid that, reset the date to a sane value if the RTC is
beyond 2038.
