ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Rework acpiphp_check_host_bridge()

Since the only existing caller of acpiphp_check_host_bridge(),
which is acpi_pci_root_scan_dependent(), already has a struct
acpi_device pointer needed to obtain the ACPIPHP context, it
doesn't make sense to execute acpi_bus_get_device() on its
handle in acpiphp_handle_to_bridge() just in order to get that
pointer back.

For this reason, modify acpiphp_check_host_bridge() to take
a struct acpi_device pointer as its argument and rearrange the
code accordingly.
