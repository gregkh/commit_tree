powerpc/booke64: Use SPRG_TLB_EXFRAME on bolted handlers

While bolted handlers (including e6500) do not need to deal with a TLB
miss recursively causing another TLB miss, nested TLB misses can still
happen with crit/mc/debug exceptions -- so we still need to honor
SPRG_TLB_EXFRAME.

We don't need to spend time modifying it in the TLB miss fastpath,
though -- the special level exception will handle that.
