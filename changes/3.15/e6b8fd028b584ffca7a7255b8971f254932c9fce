powerpc/tm: Disable IRQ in tm_recheckpoint

We can't take an IRQ when we're about to do a trechkpt as our GPR state is set
to user GPR values.

We've hit this when running some IBM Java stress tests in the lab resulting in
the following dump:

This moves tm_recheckpoint to a C function and moves the tm_restore_sprs into
that function.  It then adds IRQ disabling over the trechkpt critical section.
It also sets the TEXASR FS in the signals code to ensure this is never set now
that we explictly write the TM sprs in tm_recheckpoint.
