mmc: sdhci-s3c: Use shifts to divide by powers of two

Current implementation of sdhci_s3c_consider_clock() is highly
inefficient due to multiple integer divisions by variable performed in a
loop. Since only divisors that are powers of two are considered, this
patch replaces them with respective shifts, removing all the integer
divisions.
