mm: optimize put_mems_allowed() usage

Since put_mems_allowed() is strictly optional, its a seqcount retry, we
don't need to evaluate the function if the allocation was in fact
successful, saving a smp_rmb some loads and comparisons on some relative
fast-paths.

Since the naming, get/put_mems_allowed() does suggest a mandatory
pairing, rename the interface, as suggested by Mel, to resemble the
seqcount interface.

This gives us: read_mems_allowed_begin() and read_mems_allowed_retry(),
where it is important to note that the return value of the latter call
is inverted from its previous incarnation.
