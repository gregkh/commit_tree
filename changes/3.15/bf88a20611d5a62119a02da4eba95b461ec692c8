can: c_can: Provide protection in the xmit path

The network core does not serialize the access to the hardware. The
xmit related code lets the following happen:

CPU0 	     	       CPU1
interrupt()
 do_poll()
   c_can_do_tx()
    Fiddle with HW and	xmit()
    internal data	  Fiddle with HW and
    	     		  internal data

due the complete lack of serialization.

Add proper locking.
