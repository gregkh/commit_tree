drm/i915: Disable self-refresh for untiled fbs on i915gm

Apparently it doesn't work. X-tiled self-refresh works flawlessly
otoh. Apparently X still works correctly with linear framebuffers, so
might just be an issue with the initial modeset. It's unclear whether
this just borked wm setup from our side or a hw restriction, but just
disabling gets things going.

Note that this regression was only brought to light with

    drm/i915: Fix 915GM self-refresh enable/disable

before that self-refresh for i915GM didn't work at all.

Kudos to Ville for spotting a little bug in the original patch I've
attached to the bug.
