spi: sh-msiof: Move clock management to (un)prepare_message()

Move clock management and pin configuration from the bitbang chipselect()
method to the SPI core prepare_message() and unprepare_message() methods.

As spi_master.{,un}prepare_message() is guaranteed to be called in
matching pairs, the clock management synchronization is no longer needed.

As sh_msiof_spi_set_pin_regs() is no longer called at spi_master.setup()
time (through spi_bitbang_setup() and the spi_bitbang.chipselect()
callback), we now have to take care of that ourselves.
