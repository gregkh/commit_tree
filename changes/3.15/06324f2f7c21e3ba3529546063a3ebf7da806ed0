af_ieee802154: fix check on broadcast address

This patch fixes an issue which was introduced by commit
b70ab2e87f17176d18f67ef331064441a032b5f3 ("ieee802154: enforce
consistent endianness in the 802.15.4 stack").

The correct behaviour should be a check on the broadcast address field
which is 0xffff.
