watchdog: Add tegra watchdog

Add a driver for the hardware watchdogs in NVIDIA Tegra SoCs (Tegra30 and
later).  This driver will configure one watchdog timer that will reset the
system in the case of a watchdog timeout.

This driver binds to the nvidia,tegra30-timer device node and gets its
register base from there.
