IB/iser: Remove struct iscsi_iser_conn

The iscsi stack has existing mechanisms to link back and forth between
the iscsi connection and the iscsi transport (e.g iser/tcp) connection.

This is done through a dd_data pointer field in struct iscsi_conn
which can be set to point to the transport connection, etc.

The iscsi_iser_conn structure was used to get this linking done in
another way, which is uneeded and adds extra complication to the iser
code, so we just remove it.
