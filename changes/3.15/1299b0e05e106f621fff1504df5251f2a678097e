MIPS: Loongson: Add swiotlb to support All-Memory DMA

Loongson doesn't support DMA address above 4GB traditionally. If memory
is more than 4GB, CONFIG_SWIOTLB and ZONE_DMA32 should be selected. In
this way, DMA pages are allocated below 4GB preferably. However, if low
memory is not enough, high pages are allocated and swiotlb is used for
bouncing.

Moreover, we provide a platform-specific dma_map_ops::set_dma_mask() to
set a device's dma_mask and coherent_dma_mask. We use these masks to
distinguishes an allocated page can be used for DMA directly, or need
swiotlb to bounce.

Recently, we found that 32-bit DMA isn't a hardware bug, but a hardware
configuration issue. So, latest firmware has enable the DMA support as
high as 40-bit. To support all-memory DMA for all devices (besides the
Loongson platform limit, there are still some devices have their own
DMA32 limit), and also to be compatible with old firmware, we keep use
swiotlb.
