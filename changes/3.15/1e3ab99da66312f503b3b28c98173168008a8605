target: silence GCC warning in target_alua_state_check

Building target_core_alua.o triggers a GCC warning:
    drivers/target/target_core_alua.c: In function ‘target_alua_state_check’:
    drivers/target/target_core_alua.c:773:18: warning: ‘alua_ascq’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
       cmd->scsi_ascq = alua_ascq;
                      ^

This is a false positive. A little trial and error shows it is
apparently caused by core_alua_state_lba_dependent(). It must be hard
for GCC to track the branches of a switch statement, inside a
list_for_each_entry loop, inside a while loop.

But if we add a small (inline) helper function we can reorganize the
code a bit. That also allows to drop alua_ascq which, obviously, gets
rid of this warning.
