ARC: !PREEMPT: Ensure Return to kernel mode is IRQ safe

There was a very small race window where resume to kernel mode from a
Exception Path (or pure kernel mode which is true for most of ARC
exceptions anyways), was not disabling interrupts in restore_regs,
clobbering the exception regs

Anton found the culprit call flow (after many sleepless nights)

| 1. we got a Trap from user land
| 2. started to service it.
| 3. While doing some stuff on user-land memory (I think it is padzero()),
|     we got a DataTlbMiss
| 4. On return from it we are taking "resume_kernel_mode" path
| 5. NEED_RESHED is not set, so we go to "return from exception" path in
|     restore regs.
| 6. there seems to be IRQ happening
