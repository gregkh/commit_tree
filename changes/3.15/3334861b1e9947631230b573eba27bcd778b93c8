ACPICA: Update the conditions to enable the utility resource dump strings.

This patch enables resource dump functions for debugging purpose where
ACPI_DEBUG_OUTPUT is enabled.  Such functions are useful for developers
to track kernel issues when composing debugging patches.  They will be
optimized out during link stage for normal builds.

This patch updates the compilation condition used for the resource dump
related string tables to match the compilation environment used for
rsdump.c and rsdumpinfo.c.

This patch can help to improve the ACPICA release automation.  Lv Zheng.
