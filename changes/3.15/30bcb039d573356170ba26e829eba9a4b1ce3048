staging: comedi: pcl812: tidy up the analog input (*insn_read)

For aesthetics, move this function out of the async command support
code.

For safety, the INT request (end-of-conversion flag) should be cleared
before doing each conversion and after the final data sample is read.
The driver currently does not do this.

Refactor the function a bit so it's more like the pcl818 and pcl816
drivers and use common code to clear the flag for a timeout and after
the last sample.

Do a bit of other tidying up during the move.
