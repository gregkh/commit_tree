Btrfs: fix preallocate vs double nocow write

We can not release the reserved metadata space for the first write if we
find the write position is pre-allocated. Because the kernel might write
the data on the disk before we do the second write but after the can-nocow
check, if we release the space for the first write, we might fail to update
the metadata because of no space.

Fix this problem by end nocow write if there is dirty data in the range whose
space is pre-allocated.
