rcutorture: Abstract torture-test initialization

This commit creates torture_init_begin() and torture_init_end() functions
to abstract locking and allow the torture_type and verbose variables
in kernel/torture.o to become static.  With a bit more abstraction,
fullstop_mutex will also become static.
