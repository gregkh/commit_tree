ASoC: wm{5102, 5110, 8997}: Replace codec->control_data with arizona->regmap

With the ongoing component-ization of the ASoC framework and the continuing
migration to using regmap for IO the control_data field of the snd_soc_codec
struct will eventually be removed. Prepare the wm5192, wm5110 and wm8997
drivers for this by using arizona->regmap instead of accessing the CODEC's
control_data field.
