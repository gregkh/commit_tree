powerpc/booke64: Remove ints from EXCEPTION_COMMON

The ints parameter was used to optionally insert RECONCILE_IRQ_STATE
into EXCEPTION_COMMON.  However, since it came at the end of
EXCEPTION_COMMON, there was no real benefit for it to be there as
opposed to being called separately by the caller of EXCEPTION_COMMON.

The ints parameter was causing some hassle when trying to add an extra
macro layer.  Besides avoiding that, moving "ints" to the caller makes
the code simpler by:
 - avoiding the asymmetry where INTS_RESTORE_HARD is called separately
by the individual exception, but INTS_DISABLE was not
 - removing the no-op INTS_KEEP
 - not having an unnecessary macro parameter

It also turned out to be necessary to delay the INTS_DISABLE
in the case of special level exceptions until after we saved the
old value of PACAIRQHAPPENED.
