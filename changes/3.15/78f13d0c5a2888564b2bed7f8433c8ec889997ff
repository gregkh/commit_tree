ASoC: rsnd: add struct rsnd_dai_platform_info

R-Car sound DAI consists from SSI/SCU/SSIU/SRU...
Current R-Car sound DAI is decided from these settings,
but it is intuitively unclear, and is not good design for DT support.
This patch adds new rsnd_dai_platform_info to solve this issue.

But now, many platform is using this driver without
rsnd_dai_platform_info.
So, this patch still supports DAI settings via SSI to keep compatible.
It will be removed in next Linux version.
