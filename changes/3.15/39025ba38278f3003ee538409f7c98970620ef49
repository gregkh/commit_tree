x86/vsmp: Fix irq routing

Correct IRQ routing in case a vSMP box is detected
but the  Interrupt Routing Comply (IRC) value is set to
"comply", which leads to incorrect IRQ routing.

Before the patch:

When a vSMP box was detected and IRC was set to "comply",
users (and the kernel) couldn't effectively set the
destination of the IRQs. This is because the hook inside
vsmp_64.c always setup all CPUs as the IRQ destination using
cpumask_setall() as the return value for IRQ allocation mask.
Later, this "overrided" mask caused the kernel to set the IRQ
destination to the lowest online CPU in the mask (CPU0 usually).

After the patch:

When the IRC is set to "comply", users (and the kernel) can control
the destination of the IRQs as we will not be changing the
default "apic->vector_allocation_domain".
