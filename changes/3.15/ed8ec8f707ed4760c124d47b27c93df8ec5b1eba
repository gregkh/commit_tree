tcm_fc: Fix free-after-use regression in ft_free_cmd

This patch fixes a free-after-use regression in ft_free_cmd(), where
ft_sess_put() is called with cmd->sess after percpu_ida_free() has
already released the tag.

Fix this bug by saving the ft_sess pointer ahead of percpu_ida_free(),
and pass it directly to ft_sess_put().

The regression was originally introduced in v3.13-rc1 commit:
