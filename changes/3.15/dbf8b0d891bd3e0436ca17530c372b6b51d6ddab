ixgbevf: Check register reads for adapter removal

Check all register reads for adapter removal by checking the status
register after any register read that returns 0xFFFFFFFF. Since the
status register will never return 0xFFFFFFFF unless the adapter is
removed, such a value from a status register read confirms the
removal. Since this patch adds so much to ixgbe_read_reg, stop
inlining it, to reduce driver bloat.
