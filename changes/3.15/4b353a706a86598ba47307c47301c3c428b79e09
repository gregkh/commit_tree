ARM: OMAP4: Fix the boot regression with CPU_IDLE enabled

On OMAP4 panda board, there have been several bug reports about boot
hang and lock-ups with CPU_IDLE enabled. The root cause of the issue
is missing interrupts while in idle state. Commit cb7094e8 {cpuidle / omap4 :
use CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP flag} moved the broadcast notifiers to common
code for right reasons but on OMAP4 which suffers from a nasty ROM code
bug with GIC, commit ff999b8a {ARM: OMAP4460: Workaround for ROM bug ..},
we loose interrupts which leads to issues like lock-up, hangs etc.

Patch reverts commit cb7094 {cpuidle / omap4 : use CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP
flag} and 54769d6 {cpuidle: OMAP4: remove timer broadcast initialization} to
avoid the issue. With this change, OMAP4 panda boards, the mentioned
issues are getting fixed. We no longer loose interrupts which was the cause
of the regression.

Fixes: cb7094e8 (cpuidle / omap4 : use CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP flag)
Fixes: ff999b8a (cpuidle: OMAP4: remove timer broadcast initialization)
