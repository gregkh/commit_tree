nfsd4: remove lockowner when removing lock stateid

The nfsv4 state code has always assumed a one-to-one correspondance
between lock stateid's and lockowners even if it appears not to in some
places.

We may actually change that, but for now when FREE_STATEID releases a
lock stateid it also needs to release the parent lockowner.

Symptoms were a subsequent LOCK crashing in find_lockowner_str when it
calls same_lockowner_ino on a lockowner that unexpectedly has an empty
so_stateids list.
