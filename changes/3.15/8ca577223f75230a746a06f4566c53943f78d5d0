affs: add mount option to avoid filename truncates

Normal behavior for filenames exceeding specific filesystem limits is to
refuse operation.

AFFS standard name length being only 30 characters against 255 for usual
Linux filesystems, original implementation does filename truncate by
default with a define value AFFS_NO_TRUNCATE which can be enabled but
needs module compilation.

This patch adds 'nofilenametruncate' mount option so that user can
easily activate that feature and avoid a lot of problems (eg overwrite
files ...)
