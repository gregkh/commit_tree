net: sched: use no more than one page in struct fw_head

In commit b4e9b520ca5d ("[NET_SCHED]: Add mask support to fwmark
classifier") Patrick added an u32 field in fw_head, making it slightly
bigger than one page.

Lets use 256 slots to make fw_hash() more straight forward, and move
@mask to the beginning of the structure as we often use a small number
of skb->mark. @mask and first hash buckets share the same cache line.

This brings back the memory usage to less than 4000 bytes, and permits
John to add a rcu_head at the end of the structure later without any
worry.
