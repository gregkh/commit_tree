drm/i915: Fix SNB GT_MODE register setup

On SNB we set up WaSetupGtModeTdRowDispatch:snb early in
gen6_init_clock_gating(). That sets a bit in the GEN6_GT_MODE register.
However later we go and disable all the bits in the same register. And
then we go on to set some other bit. So apparently we never actually
implemented this workaround since the "disable all bits" part was there
already before the w/a got supposedly implemented.

These are the relevant commits:

    drm/i915: Fix GT_MODE default value

So, let's drop the "disable all bits" part, move both writes to
closer proxomity to each other, and name the WIZ hashing bits
appropriately. BSpec is still a bit confused how the bits should
actually be interpreted, but I took the the description for the
high bit since the low bit part only lists values for a single bit.

Also add a comment about our choice of WIZ hashing mode.
