[media] drx-j: get rid of dead code

There are large chunks of code at drx-j that aren't used. Most
of them are due to analog TV support. Well, just enabling them
won't make analog support work, as devices with DRX and analog
support requires an extra chip (avf4910).

We don't have drivers for it, nor the current device that uses
this frontend has support for analog TV.

So, let's just get rid of this code. If latter needed, this
patch can easily be reverted from git history.
