ACPI / blacklist: Add dmi_enable_osi_linux quirk for Asus EEE PC 1015PX

Without this this EEE PC exports a non working WMI interface, with this it
exports a working "good old" eeepc_laptop interface, fixing brightness control
not working as well as rfkill being stuck in a permanent wireless blocked
state.

This is not an ideal way to fix this, but various attempts to fix this
otherwise have failed, see:
