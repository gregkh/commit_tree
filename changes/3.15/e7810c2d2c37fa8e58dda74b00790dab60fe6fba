target: Allow READ_CAPACITY opcode in ALUA Standby access state

This patch allows READ_CAPACITY + SAI_READ_CAPACITY_16 opcode
processing to occur while the associated ALUA group is in Standby
access state.

This is required to avoid host side LUN probe failures during the
initial scan if an ALUA group has already implicitly changed into
Standby access state.

This addresses a bug reported by Chris + Philip using dm-multipath
+ ESX hosts configured with ALUA multipath.
