virtio-ccw: virtio-ccw adapter interrupt support.

Implement the new CCW_CMD_SET_IND_ADAPTER command and try to enable
adapter interrupts for every device on the first startup. If the host
does not support adapter interrupts, fall back to normal I/O interrupts.

virtio-ccw adapter interrupts use the same isc as normal I/O subchannels
and share a summary indicator for all devices sharing the same indicator
area.

Indicator bits for the individual virtqueues may be contained in the same
indicator area for different devices.
