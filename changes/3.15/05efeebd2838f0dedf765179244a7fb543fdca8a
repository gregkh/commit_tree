    drm/i915: Consolidate forcewake resetting to a single function

The reordered setup sequence ended up calling del_timer_sync before
the timer was set up correctly, resulting in endless hilarity when
loading the driver.

Compared to Ben's patch (which moved around the setup_timer call to
sanitize_early) this moves the sanitize_early call around in the
driver load call. This way we avoid calling setup_timer again in the
resume code (where we also call sanitize_early).
