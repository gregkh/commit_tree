xattr: guard against simultaneous glibc header inclusion

If the glibc xattr.h header is included after the uapi header,
compilation fails due to an enum re-using a #define from the uapi
header.

Protect against this by guarding the define and enum inclusions against
each other.

(See https://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc/2014/03/msg00029.html
and https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Synchronizing_Headers
for more information.)
