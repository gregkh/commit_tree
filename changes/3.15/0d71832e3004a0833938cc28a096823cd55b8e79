uml: Simplify tempdir logic.

Inferring the mount hierarchy correctly from /proc/mounts is hard when MS_MOVE
may have been used, and the previous code did it wrongly. This change simplifies
the logic to only require that /dev/shm be _on_ tmpfs (which can be checked
trivially with statfs) rather than that it be a _mountpoint_ of tmpfs, since
there isn't a compelling reason to be that strict. We also now check for tmpfs
on whatever directory we ultimately use so that the user is better informed.

This change also moves the more standard TMPDIR environment variable check ahead
of the others.

Applies to 3.12.
