ARM: perf: fully support Krait CPU PMU events

Krait supports a set of performance monitor region event
selection registers (PMRESR) sitting behind a cp15 based
interface that extend the architected PMU events to include Krait
CPU and Venum VFP specific events. To use these events the user
is expected to program the region register (PMRESRn) with the
event code shifted into the group they care about and then point
the PMNx event at that region+group combo by writing a
PMRESRn_GROUPx event. Add support for this hardware.

Note: the raw event number is a pure software construct that
allows us to map the multi-dimensional number space of regions,
groups, and event codes into a flat event number space suitable
for use by the perf framework.

This is based on code originally written by Ashwin Chaugule and
Neil Leeder [1].
