regulator: s5m8767: Use GPIO for controlling Buck9/eMMC

Add support for GPIO control (enable/disable) over Buck9. The Buck9
Converter is used as a supply for eMMC Host Controller.

BUCK9EN GPIO of S5M8767 chip may be used by application processor to
enable or disable the Buck9. This has two benefits:
 - It is faster than toggling it over I2C bus.
 - It allows disabling the regulator during suspend to RAM; The AP will
   enable it during resume; Without the patch the regulator supplying
   eMMC must be defined as fixed-regulator.
