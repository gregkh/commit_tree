Bluetooth: Use hdev->init/resp_addr values for smp_c1 function

Now that we have nicely tracked values of the initiator and responder
address information we can pass that directly to the smp_c1 function
without worrying e.g. about who initiated the connection. This patch
updates the two places in smp.c to use the new variables.
