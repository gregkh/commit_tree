cfg80211: consider existing DFS interfaces

It was possible to break interface combinations in
the following way:

 combo 1: iftype = AP, num_ifaces = 2, num_chans = 2,
 combo 2: iftype = AP, num_ifaces = 1, num_chans = 1, radar = HT20

With the above interface combinations it was
possible to:

 step 1. start AP on DFS channel by matching combo 2
 step 2. start AP on non-DFS channel by matching combo 1

This was possible beacuse (step 2) did not consider
if other interfaces require radar detection.

The patch changes how cfg80211 tracks channels -
instead of channel itself now a complete chandef
is stored.
