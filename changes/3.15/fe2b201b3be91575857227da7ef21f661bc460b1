KVM: x86: Check for host supported fields in shadow vmcs

We track shadow vmcs fields through two static lists,
one for read only and another for r/w fields. However, with
addition of new vmcs fields, not all fields may be supported on
all hosts. If so, copy_vmcs12_to_shadow() trying to vmwrite on
unsupported hosts will result in a vmwrite error. For example, commit
36be0b9deb23161 introduced GUEST_BNDCFGS, which is not supported
by all processors. Filter out host unsupported fields before
letting guests use shadow vmcs
