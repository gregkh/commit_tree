ixgbe: modify behavior on receiving a HW ECC error.

Currently when we noticed a HW ECC error we would request the use reload
the driver to force a reset of the part.  This was done due to the mistaken
believe that a normal reset would not be sufficient.  Well it turns out it
would be so now we just schedule a reset upon seeing the ECC.
