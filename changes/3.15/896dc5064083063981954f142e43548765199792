x86, acpi: Fix bug in associating hot-added CPUs with corresponding NUMA node

Current ACPI cpu hotplug driver fails to associate hot-added CPUs with
corresponding NUMA node when doing socket online. The code path to
associate CPU with NUMA node is as below:
acpi_processor_add()
    ->acpi_processor_get_info()
	->acpi_processor_hotadd_init()
	    ->acpi_map_lsapic()
		->_acpi_map_lsapic()
		    ->acpi_map_cpu2node()
cpu_subsys_online()
    ->try_online_node()
	->node_set_online()

When doing socket online, a new NUMA node is introduced in addition to
hot-added CPU and memory device. And the new NUMA node is marked as
online when onlining hot-added CPUs through sysfs interface
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuxx/online.

On the other hand, acpi_map_cpu2node() will only build the CPU to node
map if corresponding NUMA node is already online, so it always fails
to associate hot-added CPUs with corresponding NUMA node because the
NUMA node is still in offline state.

For the fix, we could safely remove the "node_online(node)" check in
function acpi_map_cpu2node() because it's only called for hot-added CPUs
by acpi_processor_hotadd_init().
