Bluetooth: Fix returning peer address in pending connect state

We should let user space request the peer address also in the pending
connect states, i.e. BT_CONNECT and BT_CONNECT2. There is existing user
space code that tries to do this and will fail without extending the set
of allowed states for the peer address information.

This patch adds the two states to the allowed ones in the L2CAP and
RFCOMM sock_getname functions, thereby preventing ENOTCONN from being
returned.
