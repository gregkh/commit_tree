s390/uaccess: fix possible register corruption in strnlen_user_srst()

The whole point of the out-of-line strnlen_user_srst() function was to
avoid corruption of register 0 due to register asm assignment.
However 'somebody' :) forgot to remove the update_primary_asce() function
call, which may clobber register 0 contents.
So let's remove that call and also move the size check to the calling
function.
