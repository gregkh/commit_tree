KVM: s390: Fixed CC of SIGP SET_PREFIX handler

When SIGP SET_PREFIX is called with an illegal CPU id, it must return
the condition code 3 ("not operational") instead of 1. Also fixed the
order in which the checks are done - CC3 has a higher priority than CC1.
And while we're at it, this patch also get rid of the floating interrupt
lock here by using kvm_get_vcpu() to get the local_int struct of the
destination CPU.
