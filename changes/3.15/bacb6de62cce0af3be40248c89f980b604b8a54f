staging: Additional item for rtl8188eu TODO list

The rtw_recv_indicatepkt() function in the file named
drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/os_dep/recv_linux.c has this strange code:

	rcu_read_lock();
	rcu_dereference(padapter->pnetdev->rx_handler_data);
	rcu_read_unlock();

This code has no effect.  Normally, you would assign the result of
rcu_dereference() to some variable, but it is not clear from the
code what variable that would be.  Therefore, this patch applies to
the TODO file instead of the code itself.
