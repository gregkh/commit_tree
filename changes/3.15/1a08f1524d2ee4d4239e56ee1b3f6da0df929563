MIPS: Loongson: Add UEFI-like firmware interface (LEFI) support

The new UEFI-like firmware interface (LEFI, i.e. Loongson Unified
Firmware Interface) has 3 advantages:

1, Firmware export a physical memory map which is similar to X86's
   E820 map, so prom_init_memory() will be more elegant that #ifdef
   clauses can be removed.
2, Firmware export a pci irq routing table, we no longer need pci
   irq routing fixup in kernel's code.
3, Firmware has a built-in vga bios, and its address is exported,
   the linux kernel no longer need an embedded blob.

With the LEFI interface, Loongson-3A/2G and all their successors can use
a unified kernel. All Loongson-based machines support this new interface
except 2E/2F series.
