md: avoid possible spinning md thread at shutdown.

If an md array with externally managed metadata (e.g. DDF or IMSM)
is in use, then we should not set safemode==2 at shutdown because:

1/ this is ineffective: user-space need to be involved in any 'safemode' handling,
2/ The safemode management code doesn't cope with safemode==2 on external metadata
   and md_check_recover enters an infinite loop.

Even at shutdown, an infinite-looping process can be problematic, so this
could cause shutdown to hang.
