[media] rtl28xxu: do not hard depend on staging SDR module

RTL2832 SDR extension module is currently on staging. SDR module
headers were included from staging causing direct dependency staging
directory. As a solution, add needed headers to main driver.
Motivation of that change comes from Luis / driver backports project.
