can: c_can: Make bus off interrupt disable logic work

The state change handler is called with device interrupts disabled
already. So no point in disabling them again when we enter bus off
state.

But what's worse is that we reenable the interrupts at the end of NAPI
poll unconditionally. So c_can_start() which is called from the
restart timer can trigger interrupts which confuse the hell out of the
half reinitialized driver/hw.

Remove the pointless device interrupt disable in the BUS_OFF handler
and prevent reenabling the device interrupts at the end of the poll
routine when the current state is BUS_OFF.
