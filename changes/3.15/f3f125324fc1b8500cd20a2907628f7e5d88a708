PM / suspend: Make cpuidle work in the "freeze" state

The "freeze" system sleep state introduced by commit 7e73c5ae6e79
(PM: Introduce suspend state PM_SUSPEND_FREEZE) requires cpuidle
to be functional when freeze_enter() is executed to work correctly
(that is, to be able to save any more energy than runtime idle),
but that is impossible after commit 8651f97bd951d (PM / cpuidle:
System resume hang fix with cpuidle) which caused cpuidle to be
paused in dpm_suspend_noirq() and resumed in dpm_resume_noirq().

To avoid that problem, add cpuidle_resume() and cpuidle_pause()
to the beginning and the end of freeze_enter(), respectively.
