ASoC: io: New signature for snd_soc_codec_set_cache_io()

Now that all users have been converted to regmap and the config.reg_bits
and config.val_bits can be setted by each user through regmap core API.
So these two params are redundant here.

Since the only control type that left is SND_SOC_REGMAP, so remove it. Drop
the control params and add struct regmap *regmap to simplify the code.
