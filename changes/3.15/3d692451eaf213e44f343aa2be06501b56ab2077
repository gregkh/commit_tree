ALSA: hda - Do not accept responses from non-existing codecs

While looking into some spurious responses, I found that the addr value was
treated a bit inconsistent: values 8..0xf will be treated as codec 0 and
values 0..7 will be treated as no error regardless of whether there is a codec
there, or not.

With this patch, all non-existing codecs will be treated equally.
In addition, printing rp and wp could help figuring out if the wp value is
reported wrongly from the controller or if something else is wrong.
