dm cache: prevent corruption caused by discard_block_size > cache_block_size

If the discard block size is larger than the cache block size we will
not properly quiesce IO to a region that is about to be discarded.  This
results in a race between a cache migration where no copy is needed, and
a write to an adjacent cache block that's within the same large discard
block.

Workaround this by limiting the discard_block_size to cache_block_size.
Also limit the max_discard_sectors to cache_block_size.

A more comprehensive fix that introduces range locking support in the
bio_prison and proper quiescing of a discard range that spans multiple
cache blocks is already in development.
