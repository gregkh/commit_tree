PCI: mvebu: Call request_resource() on the apertures

It is typical for host drivers to request a resource for the aperture; once
this is done the PCI core will properly populate resources for all BARs in
the system.

With this patch cat /proc/iomem will now show:

  e0000000-efffffff : PCI MEM 0000
    e0000000-e00fffff : PCI Bus 0000:01
      e0000000-e001ffff : 0000:01:00.0

Tested on Kirkwood.
