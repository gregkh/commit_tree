sched: Move rq->idle_stamp up to the core

idle_balance() modifies the rq->idle_stamp field, making this information
shared across core.c and fair.c.

As we know if the cpu is going to idle or not with the previous patch, let's
encapsulate the rq->idle_stamp information in core.c by moving it up to the
caller.

The idle_balance() function returns true in case a balancing occured and the
cpu won't be idle, false if no balance happened and the cpu is going idle.
