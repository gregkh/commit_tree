ARM: use a function table for determining instruction interpreter action

Make the instruction interpreter call back to semantic action functions
through a function pointer array provided by the invoker.  The interpreter
decodes the instructions into groups and uses the group number to index
into the supplied array.  kprobes and uprobes code will each supply their
own array of functions.
