neigh: set nud_state to NUD_INCOMPLETE when probing router reachability

Since commit 7e98056964("ipv6: router reachability probing"), a router falls
into NUD_FAILED will be probed.

Now if function rt6_select() selects a router which neighbour state is NUD_FAILED,
and at the same time function rt6_probe() changes the neighbour state to NUD_PROBE,
then function dst_neigh_output() can directly send packets, but actually the
neighbour still is unreachable. If we set nud_state to NUD_INCOMPLETE instead
NUD_PROBE, packets will not be sent out until the neihbour is reachable.

In addition, because the route should be probes with a single NS, so we must
set neigh->probes to neigh_max_probes(), then the neigh timer timeout and function
neigh_timer_handler() will not send other NS Messages.
