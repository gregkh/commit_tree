i2c: add deprecation warning for class based instantiation

Class based instantiation can cause noticeable delays when booting. This
mechanism is used when it is not possible to describe slaves on I2C
busses. As we do have other mechanisms, most embedded I2C will not need
classes and for embedded it is explicitly not recommended to use them. Add
a deprecation warning for drivers which want to disable class based
instantiation in the near future to gain boot-up time, so users relying
on this technique can switch to something better. They really should.
