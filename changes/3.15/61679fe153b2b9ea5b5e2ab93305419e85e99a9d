drm/nouveau/pm/fan: drop the fan lock in fan_update() before rescheduling

This should fix a deadlock that has been reported to us where fan_update()
would hold the fan lock and try to grab the alarm_program_lock to reschedule
an update. On an other CPU, the alarm_program_lock would have been taken
before calling fan_update(), leading to a deadlock.

We should Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 3.9+
