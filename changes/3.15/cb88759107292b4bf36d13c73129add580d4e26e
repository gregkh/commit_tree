firmware: google memconsole driver fixes

The google memconsole driver is currently broken upstream, as it tries
to read memory that is described as reserved in /proc/iomem, by
dereferencing a pointer obtained through phys_to_virt(). This triggers
a kernel fault as such regions are unmapped after early boot.

The proper workaround is to use ioremap_cache() / iounmap() around such
accesses.

As some unrelated changes, I also converted some printks to use pr_info()
and added some missing __init annotations.

Tested: booted dbg build, verified I could read /sys/firmware/log
