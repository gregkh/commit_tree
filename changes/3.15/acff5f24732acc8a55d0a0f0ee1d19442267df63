[media] rc: add allowed/enabled wakeup protocol masks

Only a single allowed and enabled protocol mask currently exists in
struct rc_dev, however to support a separate wakeup filter protocol two
of each are needed, ideally as an array.

Therefore make both rc_dev::allowed_protos and rc_dev::enabled_protocols
arrays, update all users to reference the first element
(RC_FILTER_NORMAL), and add a couple more helper functions for drivers
to use for setting the allowed and enabled wakeup protocols.

We also rename allowed_protos to allowed_protocols while we're at it,
which is more consistent with enabled_protocols.
