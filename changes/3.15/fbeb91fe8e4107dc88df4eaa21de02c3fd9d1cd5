dmaengine: sa11x0: remove broken #ifdef

The sa11x0_dma_pm_ops unconditionally reference sa11x0_dma_resume
and sa11x0_dma_suspend, which currently breaks if CONFIG_PM_SLEEP
is disabled.

There is probably a better way to remove the reference in this
case, but the safe choice is to have the suspend/resume code always
built in the driver.
