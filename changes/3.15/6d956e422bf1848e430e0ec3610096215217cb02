watchdog: Fix Elan SC520 dependencies

Anyone using a system based on an AMD Elan SC520 processor would be
building a dedicated kernel for it, so we can make the sc520_wdt
driver depend on MELAN. SC520_CPUFREQ already depends on MELAN so it
makes things more consistent. It also makes kernel configuration for
every other x86 user easier.
