ARM: dts: am335x: update USB DT references

In "ARM: dts: am33xx: correcting dt node unit address for usb", the
usb_ctrl_mod and cppi41dma nodes were updated with the correct register
addresses.  However, the dts files that reference these nodes were not
updated, and those devices are no longer being enabled.

This patch corrects the references for the affected dts files.
