cfg80211: fix channel configuration in IBSS join

When receiving an IBSS_JOINED event select the BSS object
based on the {bssid, channel} couple rather than the bssid
only.
With the current approach if another cell having the same
BSSID (but using a different channel) exists then cfg80211
picks up the wrong BSS object.
The result is a mismatching channel configuration between
cfg80211 and the driver, that can lead to any sort of
problem.

The issue can be triggered by having an IBSS sitting on
given channel and then asking the driver to create a new
cell using the same BSSID but with a different frequency.
By passing the channel to cfg80211_get_bss() we can solve
this ambiguity and retrieve/create the correct BSS object.
All the users of cfg80211_ibss_joined() have been changed
accordingly.

Moreover WARN when cfg80211_ibss_joined() gets a NULL
channel as argument and remove a bogus call of the same
function in ath6kl (it does not make sense to call
cfg80211_ibss_joined() with a zero BSSID on ibss-leave).
