uwb: don't call spin_unlock_irq in a USB completion handler

This patch converts the use of spin_lock_irq/spin_unlock_irq to
spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_irqrestore in uwb_rc_set_drp_cmd_done
which is called from a USB completion handler.  There are also
whitespace cleanups to make checkpatch.pl happy.
