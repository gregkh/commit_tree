gpio: ich: Add output levels cache support

This patch allows GPIO driver to cache GPIO_LVL output registers. The aim is to
support chipsets on which GPIO_LVL value can't be read for output pins.

Caching output levels implies the first output values reading as 0. The driver
so can't be aware of set values GPIOs by bootloader or BIOS.
