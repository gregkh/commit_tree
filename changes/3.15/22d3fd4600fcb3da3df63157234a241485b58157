drm/i915: Move num_plane to the intel_device_info structure

And rename it to num_sprites as this value doesn't count the primary
plane.

This limit lives with num_pipes really, and now that dev_priv->info is
writable we can put it there instead.

While at it, introduce a intel_device_info_runtime_init() where we'll be
able to gather the device info fields at run-time.
