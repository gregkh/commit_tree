usb: gadget: return the right length in ffs_epfile_io()

When the request length is aligned to maxpacketsize, sometimes
the return length ret > the user space requested len.

At that time, we will use min_t(size_t, ret, len) to limit the
size in case of user data buffer overflow.

But we need return the min_t(size_t, ret, len) to tell the user
space rightly also.
