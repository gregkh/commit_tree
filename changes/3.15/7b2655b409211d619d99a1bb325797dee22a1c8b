ASoC: snappercl15: Convert to table based DAPM setup

Use table based setup to register the DAPM widgets and routes.  This on one hand
makes the code a bit shorter and cleaner and on the other hand the board level
DAPM elements get registered in the card's DAPM context rather than in the
CODEC's DAPM context.
