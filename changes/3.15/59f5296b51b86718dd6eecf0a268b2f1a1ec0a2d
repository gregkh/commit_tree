cgroup: misc preps for kernfs conversion

* Un-inline seq_css().  After kernfs conversion, the function will
  need to dereference internal data structures.

* Add cgroup_get/put_root() and replace direct super_block->s_active
  manipulatinos with them.  These will be converted to kernfs_root
  refcnting.

* Add cgroup_get/put() and replace dget/put() on cgrp->dentry with
  them.  These will be converted to kernfs refcnting.

* Update current_css_set_cg_links_read() to use cgroup_name() instead
  of reaching into the dentry name.  The end result is the same.

These changes don't make functional differences but will make
transition to kernfs easier.

v2: Rebased on top of 0ab02ca8f887 ("cgroup: protect modifications to
    cgroup_idr with cgroup_mutex").
