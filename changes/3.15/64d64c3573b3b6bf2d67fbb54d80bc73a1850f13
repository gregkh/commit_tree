clk: clk-s2mps11: Refactor for including support for other MFD clocks

The clocks in S2MPS11 and S5M8767 are managed in the same way, baring
a difference in the register offset. It would be better to update
existing S2MPS11 driver to support the clocks in S5M8767, rather than
creating an almost duplicate driver altogether.
