mfd: kempld-core: Fix potential hang-up during boot

On PXT and COMe-cPC2 boards it is observed that the hardware
mutex is acquired but not being released during initialization.
This can result in a hang-up during boot if the driver is built
into the kernel.

Releasing the mutex twice if it was acquired fixes the problem.
Subsequent request/release cycles work as expected, so the fix is
only needed during initialization.
