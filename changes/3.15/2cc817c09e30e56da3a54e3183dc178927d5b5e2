staging: rtl8192u: make in r819xU_firmware.c some local functions static

Make some local functions static (firmware_init_param, fw_download_code,
CPUcheck_maincodeok_turnonCPU and CPUcheck_firmware_ready) and fix
coding style in these function declarations when It is necessary.

Fixed the following sparse warnings in r819xU_firmware.c
