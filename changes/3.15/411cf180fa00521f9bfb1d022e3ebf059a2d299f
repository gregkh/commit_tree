perf/x86/uncore: fix initialization of cpumask

On certain processors, the uncore PMU boxes may only be
msr-bsed or PCI-based. But in both cases, the cpumask,
suggesting on which CPUs to monitor to get full coverage
of the particular PMU, must be created.

However with the current code base, the cpumask was only
created on processor which had at least one MSR-based
uncore PMU. This patch removes that restriction and
ensures the cpumask is created even when there is no
msr-based PMU. For instance, on SNB client where only
a PCI-based memory controller PMU is supported.
