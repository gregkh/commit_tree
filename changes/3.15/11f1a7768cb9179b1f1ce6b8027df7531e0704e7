iommu/vt-d: Check for NULL pointer in dmar_acpi_dev_scope_init()

When ir_dev_scope_init() is called via a rootfs initcall it
will check for irq_remapping_enabled before it calls
(indirectly) into dmar_acpi_dev_scope_init() which uses the
dmar_tbl pointer without any checks.

The AMD IOMMU driver also sets the irq_remapping_enabled
flag which causes the dmar_acpi_dev_scope_init() function to
be called on systems with AMD IOMMU hardware too, causing a
boot-time kernel crash.
