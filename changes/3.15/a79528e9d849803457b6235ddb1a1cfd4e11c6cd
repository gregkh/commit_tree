ARM: integrator: register sched_clock directly

The detour through plat-versatile/sched-clock.c is hard to migrate
to multiplatform set-up and it's very little code being duplicated
so let's just inline the sched_clock registration and cut one more
dependency to plat-versatile.

This also makes this sched_clock implementation compulsory.
