ARM: OMAP2+: INTC: Acknowledge stuck active interrupts

When an interrupt has become active on the INTC it will stay active
until it is acked, even if masked or de-asserted. The
INTC_PENDING_IRQn registers are however updated and since these are
used by omap_intc_handle_irq to determine which interrupt to handle,
it will never see the active interrupt. This will result in a storm of
useless interrupts that is only stopped when another higher priority
interrupt is asserted.

Fix by sending the INTC an acknowledge if we find no interrupts to
handle.
