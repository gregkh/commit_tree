Staging: comedi: addi-data: style cleanups in hwdrv_apci1564.c

This patch cleans up a few trivial style issues, including fixing crazy
indentation problems in the defines near the top of the file, removing a
couple of unneeded braces, and wrapping a couple of long comments onto new
lines to fix lines which were in excess of 80 characters.
