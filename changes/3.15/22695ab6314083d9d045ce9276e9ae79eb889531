cpuidle: Use actual state latency in menu governor

Currently menu governor records the exit latency of the state it has
chosen for the idle period. The stored latency value is then later
used to calculate the actual length of the idle period. This value
may however be incorrect, as the entered state may not be the one
chosen by the governor. The entered state information is available,
so we can use that to obtain the real exit latency.
