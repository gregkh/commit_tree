kmemleak: free internal objects only if there're no leaks to be reported

Currently if you stop kmemleak thread before disabling kmemleak,
kmemleak objects will be freed and so you won't be able to check
previously reported leaks.

With this patch, kmemleak objects won't be freed if there're leaks that
can be reported.
