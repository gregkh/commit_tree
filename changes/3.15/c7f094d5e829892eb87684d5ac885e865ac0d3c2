ARM: mvebu: don't select CONFIG_NEON

CONFIG_NEON is meant to be user-selectable. Turning it on
unconditionally means we can't build a smaller kernel when
we don't need it, and causes build errors if CONFIG_VFP
is not also enabled.

To still have neon enabled however, we need to turn it on
now in multi_v7_defconfig and mvebu_v7_defconfig.
