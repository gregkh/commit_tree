ppc/powernv: Set the runlatch bits correctly for offline cpus

Up until now we have been setting the runlatch bits for a busy CPU and
clearing it when a CPU enters idle state. The runlatch bit has thus
been consistent with the utilization of a CPU as long as the CPU is online.

However when a CPU is hotplugged out the runlatch bit is not cleared. It
needs to be cleared to indicate an unused CPU. Hence this patch has the
runlatch bit cleared for an offline CPU just before entering an idle state
and sets it immediately after it exits the idle state.
