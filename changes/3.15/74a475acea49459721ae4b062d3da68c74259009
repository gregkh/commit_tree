SubmittingPatches: add style recommendation to use imperative descriptions

Most commit messages use this style, and the recommendation frequently
comes up in discussions (especially in response to patches that don't
use it), but that recommendation doesn't actually appear anywhere in
Documentation.  Add this style guideline to SubmittingPatches, using the
description from git's SubmittingPatches.
