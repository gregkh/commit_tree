notifier: Substitute rcu_access_pointer() for rcu_dereference_raw()

(Trivial patch.)

If the code is looking at the RCU-protected pointer itself, but not
dereferencing it, the rcu_dereference() functions can be downgraded
to rcu_access_pointer().  This commit makes this downgrade in
__blocking_notifier_call_chain() which simply compares the RCU-protected
pointer against NULL with no dereferencing.
