drm/i915: Replace a few for_each_pipe(i) by for_each_pipe(pipe)

Consistency throughout the code base is good and remove some room for
mistakes (as explained in the "drm/i915: Use a pipe variable to cycle
through the pipes" commit)

So, let's replace the for_each_pipe(i) occurences by for_each_pipe(pipe)
when it's reasonable and practical to do so (eg. when there isn't another
pipe variable already).
