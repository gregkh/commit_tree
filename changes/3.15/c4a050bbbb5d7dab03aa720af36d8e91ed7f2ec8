Btrfs: abort the transaction when we don't find our extent ref

I'm not sure why we weren't aborting here in the first place, it is obviously a
bad time from the fact that we print the leaf and yell loudly about it.  Fix
this up, otherwise we panic because our path could be pointing into oblivion.
Thanks,
