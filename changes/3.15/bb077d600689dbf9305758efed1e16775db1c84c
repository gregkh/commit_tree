Revert "x86/smpboot: Initialize secondary CPU only if master CPU will wait for it"

This reverts commit 3e1a878b7ccdb31da6d9d2b855c72ad87afeba3f.

It came in very late, and already has one reported failure: Sitsofe
reports that the current tree fails to boot on his EeePC, and bisected
it down to this.  Rather than waste time trying to figure out what's
wrong, just revert it.
