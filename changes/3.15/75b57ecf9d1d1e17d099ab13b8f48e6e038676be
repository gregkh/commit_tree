of: Make device nodes kobjects so they show up in sysfs

Device tree nodes are already treated as objects, and we already want to
expose them to userspace which is done using the /proc filesystem today.
Right now the kernel has to do a lot of work to keep the /proc view in
sync with the in-kernel representation. If device_nodes are switched to
be kobjects then the device tree code can be a whole lot simpler. It
also turns out that switching to using /sysfs from /proc results in
smaller code and data size, and the userspace ABI won't change if
/proc/device-tree symlinks to /sys/firmware/devicetree/base.

v7: Add missing sysfs_bin_attr_init()
v6: Add __of_add_property() early init fixes from Pantelis
v5: Rename firmware/ofw to firmware/devicetree
    Fix updating property values in sysfs
v4: Fixed build error on Powerpc
    Fixed handling of dynamic nodes on powerpc
v3: Fixed handling of duplicate attribute and child node names
v2: switch to using sysfs bin_attributes which solve the problem of
    reporting incorrect property size.
