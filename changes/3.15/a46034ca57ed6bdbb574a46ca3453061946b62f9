staging: usbip: trigger driver probing after unbinding from usbip-host

A sysfs attribute is used to announce kernel space that a
new driver probing session should be triggered for the just
unbinded device.

In order to have the address of struct device associated to this
USB device, a new member has been added to struct bus_id_priv.
