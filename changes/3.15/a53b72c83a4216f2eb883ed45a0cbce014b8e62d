net: Move the permission check in sock_diag_put_filterinfo to packet_diag_dump

The permission check in sock_diag_put_filterinfo is wrong, and it is so removed
from it's sources it is not clear why it is wrong.  Move the computation
into packet_diag_dump and pass a bool of the result into sock_diag_filterinfo.

This does not yet correct the capability check but instead simply moves it to make
it clear what is going on.
