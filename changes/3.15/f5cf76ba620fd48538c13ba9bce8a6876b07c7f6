xgmac: Call dev_kfree/consume_skb_any instead of dev_kfree_skb.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in xgmac_tx_complete
that can be called in hard irq and other contexts.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_kfree_skb_any in xgmac_xmit that can
be called in hard irq and other contexts.

dev_consume_skb_any is used in xgamc_tx_complete as skbs that reach
there have been successfully transmitted, dev_kfree_skby_any is used
in xgmac_xmit as skbs that are freed there are being dropped.
