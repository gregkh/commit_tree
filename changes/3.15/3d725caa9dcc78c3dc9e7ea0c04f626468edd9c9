Input: atkbd - fix keyboard not working on some LG laptops

After issuing ATKBD_CMD_RESET_DIS, keyboard on some LG laptops stops
working. The workaround is to stop issuing ATKBD_CMD_RESET_DIS commands.

In order to keep changes in atkbd driver to the minimum we check DMI
signature and only skip ATKBD_CMD_RESET_DIS if we are running on LG
LW25-B7HV or P1-J273B.
