powerpc/booke64: Use SPRG7 for VDSO

Previously SPRG3 was marked for use by both VDSO and critical
interrupts (though critical interrupts were not fully implemented).

In commit 8b64a9dfb091f1eca8b7e58da82f1e7d1d5fe0ad ("powerpc/booke64:
Use SPRG0/3 scratch for bolted TLB miss & crit int"), Mihai Caraman
made an attempt to resolve this conflict by restoring the VDSO value
early in the critical interrupt, but this has some issues:

 - It's incompatible with EXCEPTION_COMMON which restores r13 from the
   by-then-overwritten scratch (this cost me some debugging time).
 - It forces critical exceptions to be a special case handled
   differently from even machine check and debug level exceptions.
 - It didn't occur to me that it was possible to make this work at all
   (by doing a final "ld r13, PACA_EXCRIT+EX_R13(r13)") until after
   I made (most of) this patch. :-)

It might be worth investigating using a load rather than SPRG on return
from all exceptions (except TLB misses where the scratch never leaves
the SPRG) -- it could save a few cycles.  Until then, let's stick with
SPRG for all exceptions.

Since we cannot use SPRG4-7 for scratch without corrupting the state of
a KVM guest, move VDSO to SPRG7 on book3e.  Since neither SPRG4-7 nor
critical interrupts exist on book3s, SPRG3 is still used for VDSO
there.
