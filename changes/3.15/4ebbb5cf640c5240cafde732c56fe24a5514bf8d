[SCSI] qla4xxx: Reduce rom-lock contention during reset recovery.

Issue:
Driver holds rom-lock for too long during reset recovery.

During adapter reset testing, it was found that the driver
holds the rom-lock for too long, because of which other
drivers fail to acquire the rom-lock, leading to reset
failures.
The primary cause is, in the bootstrap code, while
holding the rom-lock, the driver checks if the peg is
halted, causing a 2 second contention.

Fix:
When a reset recovery starts, the driver deduces the cause, and
sets appropriate flags in watchdog & recover_adapter routines.
This flag should be used to determine if bootstrap is invoked
from probe or reset context, reducing the rom-lock footprint of
the drivers.
