drm/dp: let drivers specify the name of the I2C-over-AUX adapter

Let the drivers specify the name of the I2C-over-AUX adapter to maintain
backwards compatibility in the sysfs when converting to the new
I2C-over-AUX helper infrastructure.

The i915 driver currently uses DPDDC-A to DPDDC-D as names for the DP
i2c adapters. These names show up in the i2c sysfs name attribute. We'd
like to be able to maintain that when switching over to the new helpers.

Due to i2c device and connector cleanup ordering issues we also recently
made the drm device (instead of connector) the parent of the i2c
adapters:

    drm/i915: dp: fix order of dp aux i2c device cleanup

With the name picked up from the adapter parent using dev_name(), it
would be the same for all i2c adapters with the current I2C-over-AUX
helpers.
