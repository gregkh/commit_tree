Bluetooth: Add support for handling signature resolving keys

The connection signature resolving key (CSRK) is used for attribute
protocol signed write procedures. This change generates a new local
key during pairing and requests the peer key as well.

Newly generated key and received key will be provided to userspace
using the New Signature Resolving Key management event.

The Master CSRK can be used for verification of remote signed write
PDUs and the Slave CSRK can be used for sending signed write PDUs
to the remote device.
