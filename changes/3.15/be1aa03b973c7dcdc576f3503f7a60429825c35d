mm/compaction: change the timing to check to drop the spinlock

It is odd to drop the spinlock when we scan (SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX - 1) th
pfn page.  This may results in below situation while isolating
migratepage.

1. try isolate 0x0 ~ 0x200 pfn pages.
2. When low_pfn is 0x1ff, ((low_pfn+1) % SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX) == 0, so drop
   the spinlock.
3. Then, to complete isolating, retry to aquire the lock.

I think that it is better to use SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX th pfn for checking the
criteria about dropping the lock.  This has no harm 0x0 pfn, because, at
this time, locked variable would be false.
