perf: Fix prototype of find_pmu_context()

For some reason find_pmu_context() is defined as returning void * rather
than a __percpu struct perf_cpu_context *. As all the requisite types are
defined in advance there's no reason to keep it that way.

This patch modifies the prototype of pmu_find_context to return a
__percpu struct perf_cpu_context *.
