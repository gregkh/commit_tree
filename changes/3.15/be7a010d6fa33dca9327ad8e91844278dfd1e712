ipv6: update Destination Cache entries when gateway turn into host

RFC 4861 states in 7.2.5:

	The IsRouter flag in the cache entry MUST be set based on the
         Router flag in the received advertisement.  In those cases
         where the IsRouter flag changes from TRUE to FALSE as a result
         of this update, the node MUST remove that router from the
         Default Router List and update the Destination Cache entries
         for all destinations using that neighbor as a router as
         specified in Section 7.3.3.  This is needed to detect when a
         node that is used as a router stops forwarding packets due to
         being configured as a host.

Currently, when dealing with NA Message which IsRouter flag changes from
TRUE to FALSE, the kernel only removes router from the Default Router List,
and don't update the Destination Cache entries.

Now in order to update those Destination Cache entries, i introduce
function rt6_clean_tohost().
