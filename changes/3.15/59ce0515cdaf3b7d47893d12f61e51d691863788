iommu/vt-d: Update DRHD/RMRR/ATSR device scope caches when PCI hotplug happens

Current Intel DMAR/IOMMU driver assumes that all PCI devices associated
with DMAR/RMRR/ATSR device scope arrays are created at boot time and
won't change at runtime, so it caches pointers of associated PCI device
object. That assumption may be wrong now due to:
1) introduction of PCI host bridge hotplug
2) PCI device hotplug through sysfs interfaces.

Wang Yijing has tried to solve this issue by caching <bus, dev, func>
tupple instead of the PCI device object pointer, but that's still
unreliable because PCI bus number may change in case of hotplug.

This patch introduces a new mechanism to update the DRHD/RMRR/ATSR device scope
caches by hooking PCI bus notification.
