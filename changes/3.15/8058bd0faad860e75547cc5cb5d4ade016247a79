tracepoint: Fix use of tracepoint funcs after rcu free

Commit de7b2973903c "tracepoint: Use struct pointer instead of name hash
for reg/unreg tracepoints" introduces a use after free by calling
release_probes on the old struct tracepoint array before the newly
allocated array is published with rcu_assign_pointer. There is a race
window where tracepoints (RCU readers) can perform a
"use-after-grace-period-after-free", which shows up as a GPF in
stress-tests.
