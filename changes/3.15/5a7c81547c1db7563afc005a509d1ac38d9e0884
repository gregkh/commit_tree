memory: ti-aemif: introduce AEMIF driver

Add new AEMIF driver for EMIF16 Texas Instruments controller.
The EMIF16 module is intended to provide a glue-less interface to
a variety of asynchronous memory devices like ASRA M, NOR and NAND
memory. A total of 256M bytes of any of these memories can be
accessed at any given time via 4 chip selects with 64M byte access
per chip select.

Synchronous memories such as DDR1 SD RAM, SDR SDRAM and Mobile SDR
are not supported.

This controller is used on SoCs like Davinci, Keysone2
