powerpc/book3s: Recover from MC in sapphire on SCOM read via MMIO.

Detect and recover from machine check when inside opal on a special
scom load instructions. On specific SCOM read via MMIO we may get a machine
check exception with SRR0 pointing inside opal. To recover from MC
in this scenario, get a recovery instruction address and return to it from
MC.

OPAL will export the machine check recoverable ranges through
device tree node mcheck-recoverable-ranges under ibm,opal:

# hexdump /proc/device-tree/ibm,opal/mcheck-recoverable-ranges
0000000 0000 0000 3000 2804 0000 000c 0000 0000
0000010 3000 2814 0000 0000 3000 27f0 0000 000c
0000020 0000 0000 3000 2814 xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
0000030 llll llll yyyy yyyy yyyy yyyy
...
...
#

where:
	xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx = Starting instruction address
	llll llll           = Length of the address range.
	yyyy yyyy yyyy yyyy = recovery address

Each recoverable address range entry is (start address, len,
recovery address), 2 cells each for start and recovery address, 1 cell for
len, totalling 5 cells per entry. During kernel boot time, build up the
recovery table with the list of recovery ranges from device-tree node which
will be used during machine check exception to recover from MMIO SCOM UE.
