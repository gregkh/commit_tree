bus: mvebu-mbus: Avoid setting an undefined window size

The mbus hardware requires a power of two size, and size aligned base.
Currently, if a non-power of two is passed in to the low level routines
they configure the register in a way that results in undefined behaviour.

Call WARN and return EINVAL instead.

Also, update the debugfs routines to show a message if there is an
invalid register setting.

All together this makes the recent problems with silent failure
of PCI very obvious, noisy and debuggable.
