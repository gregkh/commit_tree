x86, hyperv: Bypass the timer_irq_works() check

This patch bypass the timer_irq_works() check for hyperv guest since:

- It was guaranteed to work.
- timer_irq_works() may fail sometime due to the lpj calibration were inaccurate
  in a hyperv guest or a buggy host.

In the future, we should get the tsc frequency from hypervisor and use preset
lpj instead.

[ hpa: I would prefer to not defer things to "the future" in the future... ]
