tipc: changes to general packet reception algorithm

We change the order of checking for destination users when processing
incoming packets. By placing the checks for users that may potentially
replace the processed buffer, i.e., CHANGEOVER_PROTOCOL and
MSG_FRAGMENTER, in a separate step before we check for the true end
users, we get rid of a label and a 'goto', at the same time making the
code more comprehensible and easy to follow.

This commit does not change any functionality, it is just a cosmetic
code reshuffle.
