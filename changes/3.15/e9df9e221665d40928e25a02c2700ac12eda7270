irqchip: sun4i: Don't ack IRQs > 0, fix acking of IRQ 0

All IRQs except for IRQ 0 seem to not need acking, so drop acking for them.

The ENMI needs to have the ack done *after* clearing the interrupt source,
otherwise we will get a spurious interrupt for each real interrupt.

So use the new IRQCHIP_EOI_THREADED flag for this in combination with
handle_fasteoi_irq. This uses a separate irq_chip struct for IRQ 0,
since we only want this behavior for IRQ 0.
