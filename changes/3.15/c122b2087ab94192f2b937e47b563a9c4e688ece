mm/compaction: check pageblock suitability once per pageblock

isolation_suitable() and migrate_async_suitable() is used to be sure
that this pageblock range is fine to be migragted.  It isn't needed to
call it on every page.  Current code do well if not suitable, but, don't
do well when suitable.

1) It re-checks isolation_suitable() on each page of a pageblock that was
   already estabilished as suitable.
2) It re-checks migrate_async_suitable() on each page of a pageblock that
   was not entered through the next_pageblock: label, because
   last_pageblock_nr is not otherwise updated.

This patch fixes situation by 1) calling isolation_suitable() only once
per pageblock and 2) always updating last_pageblock_nr to the pageblock
that was just checked.

Additionally, move PageBuddy() check after pageblock unit check, since
pageblock check is the first thing we should do and makes things more
simple.
