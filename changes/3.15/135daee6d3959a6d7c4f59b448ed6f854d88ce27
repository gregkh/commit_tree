tipc: redefine 'started' flag in struct link to bitmap

Currently, the 'started' field in struct tipc_link represents only a
binary state, 'started' or 'not started'. We need it to represent
more link execution states in the coming commits in this series.
Hence, we rename the field to 'flags', and define the current
started/non-started state to be represented by the LSB bit of
that field.
