bdi: avoid oops on device removal

After commit 839a8e8660b6 ("writeback: replace custom worker pool
implementation with unbound workqueue") when device is removed while we
are writing to it we crash in bdi_writeback_workfn() ->
set_worker_desc() because bdi->dev is NULL.

This can happen because even though bdi_unregister() cancels all pending
flushing work, nothing really prevents new ones from being queued from
balance_dirty_pages() or other places.

Fix the problem by clearing BDI_registered bit in bdi_unregister() and
checking it before scheduling of any flushing work.
