mei: wd: fix stop completion failure

While running Documentation/watchdog/src/watchdog-simple.c
and quiting by Ctrl-C, fallowing error is displayed:
mei_me 0000:00:16.0: wd: stop failed to complete ret=-512.

The whatchdog core framework is not able to propagate
-ESYSRESTART or -EINTR. Also There is no much sense in
restarting the close system call so instead of using
wait_event_interruptible_timeout we can use wait_event_timeout
with reasonable 10 msecs timeout.
