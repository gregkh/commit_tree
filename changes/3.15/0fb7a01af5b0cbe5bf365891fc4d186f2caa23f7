random: simplify accounting code

With this we handle "reserved" in just one place.  As a bonus the
code becomes less nested, and the "wakeup_write" flag variable
becomes unnecessary.  The variable "flags" was already unused.

This code behaves identically to the previous version except in
two pathological cases that don't occur.  If the argument "nbytes"
is already less than "min", then we didn't previously enforce
"min".  If r->limit is false while "reserved" is nonzero, then we
previously applied "reserved" in checking whether we had enough
bits, even though we don't apply it to actually limit how many we
take.  The callers of account() never exercise either of these cases.

Before the previous commit, it was possible for "nbytes" to be less
than "min" if userspace chose a pathological configuration, but no
longer.
