[SCSI] libiscsi: remove unneeded queue work when max_cmdsn is increased

iscsi_queuecommand will only take in commands that can fit in the
current window. So, if a command is on the cmdqueue then it can
fit in the current window. If a command is on the mgmtqueue, then
we are setting the immediate bit so they will also fit in the
window. As a result, we never need to to do a iscsi_conn_queue_work
when the maxCmdSn is increased.

What should happen is that a command will complete the window will
be increased, then the scsi layer will send us more commands by
running the scsi_device queues.
