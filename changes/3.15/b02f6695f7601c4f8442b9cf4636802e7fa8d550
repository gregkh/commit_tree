PM / QoS: Rename device resume latency QoS items

Rename symbols, variables, functions and structure fields related do
the resume latency device PM QoS type so that it is clear where they
belong (in particular, to avoid confusion with the latency tolerance
device PM QoS type introduced by a subsequent changeset).

Update the PM QoS documentation to better reflect its current state.
