ACPICA: Add auto-serialization support for ill-behaved control methods.

This change adds support to automatically mark a control method as
"serialized" if the method creates any named objects. This will
positively prevent the method from being entered by more than one
thread and thus preventing a possible abort when an attempt is
made to create an object twice.

Implemented by parsing all non-serialize control methods at table
load time.

This feature is disabled by default and this patch also adds a new
Linux kernel parameter "acpi_auto_serialize" to allow this feature
to be turned on for a specific boot.
