sched: declare pid_alive as inline

We accidentally declared pid_alive without any extern/inline connotation.
Some platforms were fine with this, some like ia64 and mips were very angry.
If the function is inline, the prototype should be inline!

on ia64:
include/linux/sched.h:1718: warning: 'pid_alive' declared inline after
being called
