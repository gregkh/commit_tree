xen-netback: Non-functional follow-up patch for grant mapping series

Ian made some late comments about the grant mapping series, I incorporated the
non-functional outcomes into this patch:

- typo fixes in a comment of xenvif_free(), and add another one there as well
- typo fix for comment of rx_drain_timeout_msecs
- remove stale comment before calling xenvif_grant_handle_reset()
