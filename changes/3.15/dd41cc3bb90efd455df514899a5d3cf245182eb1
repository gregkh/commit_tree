net/mlx4: Adapt num_vfs/probed_vf params for single port VF

A new syntax is added for the module parameters num_vfs and probe_vf.

  num_vfs=p1,p2,p1+p2
  probe_bf=p1,p2,p1+p2

Where p1(2) is the number of VFs on / probed VFs for physical
port1(2) and p1+p2 is the number of dual port VFs.

Single port VFs are currently supported only when the link type
for both ports of the device is Ethernet.
