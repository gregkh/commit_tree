bnx2x: save RAM in kdump kernel by disabling TPA

When running in a kdump kernel, disable TPA. This saves memory, which
tends to be scarce in kdump.

TPA, being a receive acceleration, is unlikely to be useful for kdump,
whose purpose is to send the memory image out.

This saves additional 5 MB in the kdump environment.
