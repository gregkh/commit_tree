ACPICA: Ignore sync_level for methods that have been auto-serialized.

Cannot use a sync_level for methods that have been serialized at load-time
or runtime because this may interfere with any existing use of sync_levels
within the ASL code. So, we simply ignore the sync_level for these methods,
thus preserving any existing sync_level priorities. Note, the use of
sync_levels is actually rather rare within BIOS ASL code.
