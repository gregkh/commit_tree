ACPICA: Introduce acpi_get_data_full() and rework acpi_get_data()

Introduce a new function, acpi_get_data_full(), working in analogy
with acpi_get_data() except that it can execute a callback provided
as its 4th argument right after acpi_ns_get_attached_data() has
returned a success.

That will allow Linux to reference count the object pointed to by
*data before the namespace mutex is released so as to ensure that it
will not be freed going forward until the reference to it acquired
by acpi_get_data_full() is dropped.
