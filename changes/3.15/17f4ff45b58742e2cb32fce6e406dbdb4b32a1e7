dm mpath: do not call pg_init when it is already running

This patch moves condition checks as a preparation of following
patches and has no effect on behaviour.
process_queued_ios() is the only caller of __pg_init_all_paths()
and 2 condition checks are moved from outside to inside without
side effects.
