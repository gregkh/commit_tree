kernfs: implement kernfs_node_from_dentry(), kernfs_root_from_sb() and kernfs_rename()

Implement helpers to determine node from dentry and root from
super_block.  Also add a kernfs_rename_ns() wrapper which assumes NULL
namespace.  These generally make sense and will be used by cgroup.

v2: Some dummy implementations for !CONFIG_SYSFS was missing.  Fixed.
