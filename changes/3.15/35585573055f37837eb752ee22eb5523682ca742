cgroup: drop CGRP_ROOT_SUBSYS_BOUND

Before kernfs conversion, due to the way super_block lookup works,
cgroup roots were created and made visible before being fully
initialized.  This in turn required a special flag to mark that the
root hasn't been fully initialized so that the destruction path can
tell fully bound ones from half initialized.

That flag is CGRP_ROOT_SUBSYS_BOUND and no longer necessary after the
kernfs conversion as the lookup and creation of new root are atomic
w.r.t. cgroup_mutex.  This patch removes the flag and passes the
requests subsystem mask to cgroup_setup_root() so that it can set the
respective mask bits as subsystems are bound.
