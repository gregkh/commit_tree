btrfs: Cleanup the "_struct" suffix in btrfs_workequeue

Since the "_struct" suffix is mainly used for distinguish the differnt
btrfs_work between the original and the newly created one,
there is no need using the suffix since all btrfs_workers are changed
into btrfs_workqueue.

Also this patch fixed some codes whose code style is changed due to the
too long "_struct" suffix.
