mmc: core: Rename max_discard_to to max_busy_timeout

Rename host->max_discard_to to host->max_busy_timeout, to reflect that
it tells the mmc core layer about the maximum supported busy detection
timeout by the host.

This timeout is at the moment only applicable to erase/trim/discard
commands. By the renaming we provide the option of make use of it for
other commands that cares about busy detection. In other words, those
commands that wants an R1B response, like for example the mmc switch
command.

Do note that the max_busy_timeout is supposed to be specified only by
hosts supporting MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY.
