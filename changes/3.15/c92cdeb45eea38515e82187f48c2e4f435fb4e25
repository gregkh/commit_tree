audit: convert PPIDs to the inital PID namespace.

sys_getppid() returns the parent pid of the current process in its own pid
namespace.  Since audit filters are based in the init pid namespace, a process
could avoid a filter or trigger an unintended one by being in an alternate pid
namespace or log meaningless information.

Switch to task_ppid_nr() for PPIDs to anchor all audit filters in the
init_pid_ns.
