ixgbevf: fix skb->pkt_type checks

skb->pkt_type is not a bitmask, but contains only value at a time from
the range defined in include/uapi/linux/if_packet.h.

Checking it like if it was a bitmask of values would also cause
PACKET_OTHERHOST, PACKET_LOOPBACK and PACKET_FASTROUTE to be matched by
this check since their lower 2 bits are also set, although that does not
fix a real bug, it is still potentially confusing.

This bogus check was introduced in commit 815cccbf ("ixgbe: add setlink,
getlink support to ixgbe and ixgbevf").
