drm/i915: Some polish for the new pipestat_irq_handler

Just a bit of polish which I hope will help me with massaging some
internal patches to use Imre's reworked pipestat handling:
- Don't check for underrun reporting or enable pipestat interrupts
  twice.
- Frob the comments a bit.
- Do the iir PIPE_EVENT to pipe mapping explicitly with a switch. We
  only have one place which does this, so better to make it explicit.

v2: Ville noticed that I've broken the logic a bit with trying to
avoid checking whether we're interested in a given pipe twice. push
the PIPESTAT read down after we've computed the mask of interesting
bits first to avoid that duplication properly.

v3: Squash in fixups from Imre on irc.
