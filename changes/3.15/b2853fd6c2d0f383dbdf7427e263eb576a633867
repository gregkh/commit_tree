IB/core: Don't resolve passive side RoCE L2 address in CMA REQ handler

The code that resolves the passive side source MAC within the rdma_cm
connection request handler was both redundant and buggy, so remove it.

It was redundant since later, when an RC QP is modified to RTR state,
the resolution will take place in the ib_core module.  It was buggy
because this callback also deals with UD SIDR exchange, for which we
incorrectly looked at the REQ member of the CM event and dereferenced
a random value.
