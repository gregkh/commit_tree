imx-drm: remove separate imx-fbdev

Now that we know when the components of the imx-drm subsystem will be
initialised, we can move the fbdev helper initialisation and teardown
into imx-drm-core.  This gives us the required ordering that DRM wants
in both driver load and unload methods.

We can also stop exporting the imx_drm_device_get() and
imx_drm_device_put() methods; nothing but the fbdev helper was making
use of these.
