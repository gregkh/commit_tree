gianfar: Fix multi-queue support checks @probe()

priv is not instantiated at gfar_of_init() time, when
parsing the DT for info on supported HW queues.  Before
the netdev can be allocated, the number of supported
queues must be known.  Because the number of supported
queues depends on device type, move the compatibility
checks before netdev allocation.  Local vars are used
to hold the operation mode info before netdev allocation.
This fixes the null accesses for priv->.., in gfar_of_init.
