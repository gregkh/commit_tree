[media] drx-j: fix boot failure due to null pointer dereference

DJH_DEBUG only code path in drxbsp_i2c_write_read() dereferences
w_dev_addr and subsequently w_dev_addr->user_data->i2c which results
in failure during boot. This patch fixes the null pointer derefence
bug as well as the following compile errors:
