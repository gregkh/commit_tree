hwmon: (ntc_thermistor) Fix OF device ID mapping

The mapping from OF device IDs to platform device IDs is wrong.
TYPE_NCPXXWB473 is 0, TYPE_NCPXXWL333 is 1, so
ntc_thermistor_id[TYPE_NCPXXWB473] is { "ncp15wb473", TYPE_NCPXXWB473 }
while
ntc_thermistor_id[TYPE_NCPXXWL333] is { "ncp18wb473", TYPE_NCPXXWB473 }.

So the name is wrong for all but the "ntc,ncp15wb473" entry, and the
type is wrong for the "ntc,ncp15wl333" entry.

So map the entries by index, it is neither elegant nor robust but at
least it is correct.
