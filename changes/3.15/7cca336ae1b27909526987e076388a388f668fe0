gianfar: Remove clean_rx_ring race from gfar_ethtool

gfar_clean_rx_ring() was designed to be called from napi
(rx softirq) context to do the Rx processing. Calling it
from a process context like this is a bug as it will
clearly race with the napi Rx processing.

There's also no point in initializing num_txbdfree since
startup_gfar() already does that, when bringing the device
up again (after reset). Changing num_txbdfree "on-the-fly"
like this is also subject to race conditions.  num_txbdfree
is handled by the Tx processing path and the device reset
procedure.  Also, don't assume that num_rx_queues is always
equal to num_tx_queues.
