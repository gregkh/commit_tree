staging: comedi: comedi_fops: introduce __comedi_get_user_cmd()

The COMEDI_CMD and COMEDI_CMDTEST ioctl functions both copy the
comedi_cmd passed by the user from __user memory space to kernel
memory space. They then do some basic sanity checking of the cmd
before the subdevice (*do_cmdtest) and (*do_cmd) operations are
called.

Introduce a helper function to handle the copy_from_user() and
do the basic sanity checking.
