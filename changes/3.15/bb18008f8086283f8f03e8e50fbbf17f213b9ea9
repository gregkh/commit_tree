intel_pstate: Set core to min P state during core offline

Change to use the new ->stop_cpu() callback to do clean up during CPU
hotplug. The requested P state for an offline core will be used by the
hardware coordination function to select the package P state. If the
core is under load when it is offlined it will fix the package P state
floor to the requested P state of offline core.
