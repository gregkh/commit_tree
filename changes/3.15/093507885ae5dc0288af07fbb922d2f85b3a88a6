xen-netback: Timeout packets in RX path

A malicious or buggy guest can leave its queue filled indefinitely, in which
case qdisc start to queue packets for that VIF. If those packets came from an
another guest, it can block its slots and prevent shutdown. To avoid that, we
make sure the queue is drained in every 10 seconds.
The QDisc queue in worst case takes 3 round to flush usually.
