drm: add minor-lookup/release helpers

Instead of accessing drm_minors_idr directly, this adds a small helper to
hide the internals. This will help us later to remove the drm_global_mutex
requirement for minor-lookup.

Furthermore, this also makes sure that minor->dev is always valid and
takes a reference-count to the device as long as the minor is used in an
open-file. This way, "struct file*"->private_data->dev is guaranteed to be
valid (which it has to, as we cannot reset it).
