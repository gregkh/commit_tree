ath10k: Set proper nss value for the peer

It was found during testing the nss calculation does not
cover all corner cases. Station could request eq. only MCS8
and MCS9 (nss=2 specific). Next num_rates=2 so the driver
sets nss=(max((2+7)/8, 1))=1. Which is wrong. The in-driver
calculation was introduced prior (commit ddcc347b70
mac80211: fix rx_nss calculation for drivers with hw rc).
Since it's fixed, use mac80211 provided value from now.
End user will experience lower throuhputs than expected
if the nss is wrongly calculated.
