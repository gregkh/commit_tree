[SCSI] remove a useless get/put_device pair in scsi_request_fn

SCSI devices may only be removed by calling scsi_remove_device().
That function must invoke blk_cleanup_queue() before the final put
of sdev->sdev_gendev. Since blk_cleanup_queue() waits for the
block queue to drain and then tears it down, scsi_request_fn cannot
be active anymore after blk_cleanup_queue() has returned and hence
the get_device()/put_device() pair in scsi_request_fn is unnecessary.
