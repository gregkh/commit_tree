ata: ahci_platform: runtime resume the device before use

On OMAP platforms the device needs to be runtime resumed before it can
be accessed. The OMAP HWMOD framework takes care of enabling the
module and its resources based on the device's runtime PM state.

In this patch we runtime resume during .probe() and runtime suspend
after .remove().

We also update the runtime PM state during .resume().
