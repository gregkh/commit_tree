perf/x86: Fix RAPL rdmsrl_safe() usage

This patch fixes a bug introduced by:

  24223657806a ("perf/x86/intel: Use rdmsrl_safe() when initializing RAPL PMU")

The rdmsrl_safe() function returns 0 on success.
The current code was failing to detect the RAPL PMU
on real hardware  (missing /sys/devices/power) because
the return value of rdmsrl_safe() was misinterpreted.
