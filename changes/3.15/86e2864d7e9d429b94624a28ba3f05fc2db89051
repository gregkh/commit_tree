usb: wusbcore: disable transfer notifications for Alereon HWAs

The HWA driver does not do anything with transfer notifications after
receiving the first one and the Alereon HWA allows them to be disabled
as a performance optimization.  This patch sends a vendor specific
command to the Alereon HWA on startup to disable transfer notifications.
If the command is successful, the DTI system is started immediately
since that would normally be started upon the first reception of a
transfer notification which will no longer be sent.
