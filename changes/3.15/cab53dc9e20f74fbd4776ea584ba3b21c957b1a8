tty/serial: omap: fix RX interrupt enable/disable in half-duplex TX

Make sure that serial_omap_stop_rx() also disables RDI (Receiver Data Interrupt),
otherwise the interrupt handler will call serial_omap_rdi() to read the new data,
resulting in the transmission being echoed back.

When the half-duplex transmission is complete, in order to reverse the effects of
serial_omap_stop_rx(), we should re-enable:

  * the RX interrupts _without_ overwriting up->ier

  * the UART_LSR_DR bit of the up->port.read_status_mask
