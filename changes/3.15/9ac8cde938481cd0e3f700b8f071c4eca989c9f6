powerpc/pseries: Use remove_memory() to remove memory

The memory remove code for powerpc/pseries should call remove_memory()
so that we are holding the hotplug_memory lock during memory remove
operations.

This patch updates the memory node remove handler to call remove_memory()
and adds a ppc_md.remove_memory() entry to handle pseries specific work
that is called from arch_remove_memory().

During memory remove in pseries_remove_memblock() we have to stay with
removing memory one section at a time. This is needed because of how memory
resources are handled. During memory add for pseries (via the probe file in
sysfs) we add memory one section at a time which gives us a memory resource
for each section. Future patches will aim to address this so will not have
to remove memory one section at a time.
