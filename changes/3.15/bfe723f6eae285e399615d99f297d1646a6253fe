ASoC: sirf-audio-codec: Remove snd_soc_codec_set_cache_io() call

There was a overlap between the snd_soc_codec_set_cache_io() cleanup and the
addition of the sirf-audio-codec resulting in the sirf-audio-codec driver still
using the old signature of snd_soc_codec_set_cache_io(), which will cause a
compile error. Since the core is able to automatically setup IO for this driver
we can just remove both the snd_soc_set_cache_io() call and the control_data
assignment.
