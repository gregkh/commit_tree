uas: Fix uas not working when plugged into an ehci port

I thought it would be a good idea to also test uas with usb-2, and it turns out
it was, as it did not work. The problem is that the uas driver was passing the
bEndpointAddress' direction bit to usb_rcvbulkpipe, the xhci code seems to not
care about this, but with the ehci code this causes usb_submit_urb failure.

With this fixed the uas code works nicely with an uas device plugged into
an ehci port.
