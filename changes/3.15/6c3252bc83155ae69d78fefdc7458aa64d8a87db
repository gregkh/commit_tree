drm/nouveau: fix small thinko in vblank timestamping.

*hpos horizontal scanout position doesn't need to be corrected
to count the pixels between hactive end and htotal negative.
That is only needed for *vpos to count lines until end of
vblank for the vblank timestamping.

Use hpos as is without correction.

Removes occassional spikes in timestamps of up to 1 scanline
duration, thereby improves accuracy to about +/- 2 usecs instead
of +/- 12 usecs, wrt. true onset time as measured with high
precision equipment on NV-A5.
