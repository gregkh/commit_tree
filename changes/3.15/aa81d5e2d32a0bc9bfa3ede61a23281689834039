[media] drx-j: use customise option correctly

The Kconfig entry for "Micronas DRX-J demodulator" defaults to modular
if DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE is set. But that Kconfig symbol was replaced with
MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT as of v3.7. So use the new symbol. And negate
the logic, because MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT's logic is the opposite of
the former logic.
