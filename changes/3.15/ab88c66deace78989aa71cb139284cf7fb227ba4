[media] rc: add wakeup_protocols sysfs file

Add a wakeup_protocols sysfs file which controls the new
rc_dev::enabled_protocols[RC_FILTER_WAKEUP], which is the mask of
protocols that are used for the wakeup filter.

A new RC driver callback change_wakeup_protocol() is called to change
the wakeup protocol mask.
