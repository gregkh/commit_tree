arm64: mm: Route pmd thp functions through pte equivalents

Rather than have separate hugetlb and transparent huge page pmd
manipulation functions, re-wire our thp functions to simply call the
pte equivalents.

This allows THP to take advantage of the new PTE_WRITE logic introduced
in:
  c2c93e5 arm64: mm: Introduce PTE_WRITE

To represent splitting THPs we use the PTE_SPECIAL bit as this is not
used for pmds.
