netpoll: Respect NETIF_F_LLTX

Stop taking the transmit lock when a network device has specified
NETIF_F_LLTX.

If no locks needed to trasnmit a packet this is the ideal scenario for
netpoll as all packets can be trasnmitted immediately.

Even if some locks are needed in ndo_start_xmit skipping any unnecessary
serialization is desirable for netpoll as it makes it more likely a
debugging packet may be trasnmitted immediately instead of being
deferred until later.
