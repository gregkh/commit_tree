NFC: port100: Add support for type 4A tag platform

This adds support for ISO-DEP protocol over NFC-A rf technology. The
port100 already supports NFC-A and ATS request and response for type 4A
tags are handled at digital level. This patch adds NFC_PROTO_ISO14443
to the supported protocols and an entry for framing configuration which
is the same as NFC-A standard frame with CRC handling.
