ARM: mvebu: fix definitions of PCIe interfaces on Armada 38x

Due a copy/paste error, the 'reg' values for the third PCIe interface
on Armada 380, and the third and fourth PCIe interfaces on Armada 385
are wrong: they are equal to the one of the second PCIe interface.

This patch fixes this by using the appropriate 'reg' values for those
PCIe interfaces.

Without this fix, the third and fourth PCIe interfaces are unusable on
those platforms.
