kbuild: create a build directory automatically for out-of-tree build

Kbuild supports saving output files in a separate directory.
But the build directory must be created beforehand. For example,

  $ mkdir -p dir/to/store/output/files
  $ make O=dir/to/store/output/files defconfig

Creating a build directory automatically would be useful.
