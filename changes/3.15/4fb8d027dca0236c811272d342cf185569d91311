powerpc: Fix Oops in rtas_stop_self()

commit 41dd03a9 may cause Oops in rtas_stop_self().

The reason is that the rtas_args was moved into stack space. For a box
with more that 4GB RAM, the stack could easily be outside 32bit range,
but RTAS is 32bit.

So the patch moves rtas_args away from stack by adding static before
it.
