drm: Protect the master management with a drm_device::master_mutex v3

The master management was previously protected by the drm_device::struct_mutex.
In order to avoid locking order violations in a reworked dropped master
security check in the vmwgfx driver, break it out into a separate master_mutex.
Locking order is master_mutex -> struct_mutex.

Also remove drm_master::blocked since it's not used.

v2: Add an inline comment about what drm_device::master_mutex is protecting.
v3: Remove unneeded struct_mutex locks. Fix error returns in
    drm_setmaster_ioctl().
