sched: Implement task_nice() as static inline function

As patch "sched: Move the priority specific bits into a new header file" exposes
the priority related macros in linux/sched/prio.h, we don't have to implement
task_nice() in kernel/sched/core.c any more.

This patch implements it in linux/sched/sched.h as static inline function,
saving the kernel stack and enhancing performance a bit.
