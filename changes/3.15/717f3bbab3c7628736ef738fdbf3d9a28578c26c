serial_core: Fix conditional start_tx on ring buffer not empty

If the serial_core ring buffer empties just as the tty layer receives
an XOFF, then start_tx will never be called when the tty layer
receives an XON as the serial_core ring buffer is empty.  This will
possibly leave a few bytes trapped in the fifo for drivers that
disable the transmitter when flow controlled.
