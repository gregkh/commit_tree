bug: when !CONFIG_BUG, simplify WARN_ON_ONCE and family

When !CONFIG_BUG, WARN_ON and family become simple passthroughs of their
condition argument; however, WARN_ON_ONCE and family still have conditions
and a boolean to detect one-time invocation, even though the warning
they'd emit doesn't exist.  Make the existing definitions conditional on
CONFIG_BUG, and add definitions for !CONFIG_BUG that map to the
passthrough versions of WARN and WARN_ON.

This saves 4.4k on a minimized configuration (smaller than allnoconfig),
and 20.6k with defconfig plus CONFIG_BUG=n.
