parisc: 'renameat2()' doesn't need (or have) a separate compat system call

The 'renameat2()' system call was incorrectly added as a ENTRY_COMP() in
the parisc system call table by commit 18e480aa07f78 ("parisc: add
renameat2 syscall").  That causes a link-time error due to there not
being any compat version of that system call:

  arch/parisc/kernel/built-in.o: In function `sys_call_table':
  (.rodata+0xad0): undefined reference to `compat_sys_renameat2'
  make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

Easily fixed by marking the system call as being the same for compat as
for native by using ENTRY_SAME() instead of ENTRY_COMP().
