i2c: at91: Add device tree property to set clock-frequency

This adds the ability to set "clock-frequency" in the device tree for the at91
i2cbus following the naming of other i2c bus implementations. If the property
is not set,the clock frequency will default to the previously used define
of 100KHz.
