MIPS: Deprecate CONFIG_MIPS_CMP

CONFIG_MIPS_CPS is a better option for systems where it is supported,
which as far as I am aware should be all systems where CONFIG_MIPS_CMP
could provide any value (ie. where there are multiple cores for YAMON to
bring up). This option is therefore deprecated, and marked as such. It
is left intact for the time being in order to provide a fallback should
someone find a system where CONFIG_MIPS_CPS will not function (ie. where
the reset vector cannot be moved), and should be removed entirely in the
future assuming that does not happen.
