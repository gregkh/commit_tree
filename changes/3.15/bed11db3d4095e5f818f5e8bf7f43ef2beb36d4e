can: c_can: Fix startup logic

c_can_start() enables interrupts way too early. The first enabling
happens when setting the control mode in c_can_chip_config() and then
again at the end of the function.

But that happens before napi_enable() and that means that an interrupt
which comes in will disable interrupts again and call napi_schedule,
which ignores the request and the later napi_enable() is not making
thinks work either. So the interface is up with all device interrupts
disabled.

Move the device interrupt after napi_enable() and add it to the other
callsites of c_can_start() in c_can_set_mode() and c_can_power_up()
