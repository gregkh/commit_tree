ipv6: honor IPV6_PKTINFO with v4 mapped addresses on sendmsg

In case we decide in udp6_sendmsg to send the packet down the ipv4
udp_sendmsg path because the destination is either of family AF_INET or
the destination is an ipv4 mapped ipv6 address, we don't honor the
maybe specified ipv4 mapped ipv6 address in IPV6_PKTINFO.

We simply can check for this option in ip_cmsg_send because no calls to
ipv6 module functions are needed to do so.
