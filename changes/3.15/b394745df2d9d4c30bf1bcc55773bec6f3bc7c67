net: phy: Don't call phy_resume if phy_init_hw failed

After the call to phy_init_hw failed in phy_attach_direct, phy_detach is called
to detach the phy device from its network device. If the attached driver is a
generic phy driver, this also detaches the driver. Subsequently phy_resume
is called, which assumes without checking that a driver is attached to the
device. This will result in a crash such as

Only call phy_resume if phy_init_hw was successful.
