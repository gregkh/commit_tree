ARM: Kirkwood: T5325: Fix double probe of Codec

The codec is defined both in DT and the board file. The board file
however contains platform data which is required in order that the
codec works. When the DT instantiates the codec before the board files
does, it is missing the platform data and so fails. Remove the DT node
until we have a binding which can pass the additional data.
