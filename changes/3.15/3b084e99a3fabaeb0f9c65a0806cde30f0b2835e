netfilter: nf_tables: fix trace of matching non-terminal rule

Add the corresponding trace if we have a full match in a non-terminal
rule. Note that the traces will look slightly different than in
x_tables since the log message after all expressions have been
evaluated (contrary to x_tables, that emits it before the target
action). This manifests in two differences in nf_tables wrt. x_tables:

1) The rule that enables the tracing is included in the trace.

2) If the rule emits some log message, that is shown before the
   trace log message.
