drivers: block: Move prototype declaration of function tl_abort_disk_io() to appropriate header file from drbd_state.c

Move the prototype declaration of function tl_abort_disk_io() from
drbd/drbd_state.c to appropriate header file drbd/drbd_int.h because it
is used by more than 2 files.

This eliminates the following warnings in drbd/drbd_main.c:
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_main.c:310:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘tl_abort_disk_io’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
