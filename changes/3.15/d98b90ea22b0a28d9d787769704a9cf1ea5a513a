ARM: 7990/1: asm: rename logical shift macros push pull into lspush lspull

Renames logical shift macros, 'push' and 'pull', defined in
arch/arm/include/asm/assembler.h, into 'lspush' and 'lspull'.
That eliminates name conflict between 'push' logical shift macro
and 'push' instruction mnemonic. That allows assembler.h to be
included in .S files that use 'push' instruction.
