tracing: Set up infrastructure to allow tracers for instances

Currently the tracers (function, function_graph, irqsoff, etc) can only
be used by the top level tracing directory (not for instances).

This sets up the infrastructure to allow instances to be able to
run a separate tracer apart from the what the top level tracing is
doing.

As tracers need to adapt for being used by instances, the tracers
must flag if they can be used by instances or not. Currently only the
'nop' tracer can be used by all instances.
