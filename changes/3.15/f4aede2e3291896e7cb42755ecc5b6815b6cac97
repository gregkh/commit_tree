drm: skip redundant minor-lookup in open path

The drm_open_helper() function is only used internally for drm_open() so
we can safely pass in the minor-object directly instead of the minor-id.
This way, we avoid the additional minor IDR lookup, which we already do
twice in drm_stub_open() and drm_open().
