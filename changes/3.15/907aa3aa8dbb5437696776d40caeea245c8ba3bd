phy: restore OMAP_CONTROL_PHY dependencies

When OMAP_CONTROL_USB was renamed to OMAP_CONTROL_PHY (commit
14da699b), its dependencies were lost in the process. Nothing in the
commit message indicates that this removal was intentional, so I think
it was by accident and the dependencies should be restored.
