cxfb4vf: Call dev_kfree/consume_skb_any instead of [dev_]kfree_skb.

Replace kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in free_tx_desc that can be
called in hard irq and other contexts. dev_consume_skb_any is used
as this function consumes successfully transmitted skbs.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_kfree_skb_any in t4vf_eth_xmit that can
be called in hard irq and other contexts, on paths that drop the skb.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in t4vf_eth_xmit that can
be called in hard irq and other contexts, on paths that successfully
transmit the skb.
