resources: Set type in __request_region()

We don't set the type (I/O, memory, etc.) of resources added by
__request_region(), which leads to confusing messages like this:

    address space collision: [io  0x1000-0x107f] conflicts with ACPI CPU throttle [??? 0x00001010-0x00001015 flags 0x80000000]

Set the type of a new resource added by __request_region() (used by
request_region() and request_mem_region()) to the type of its parent.  This
makes the resource tree internally consistent and fixes messages like the
above, where the ACPI CPU throttle resource really is an I/O port region,
but request_region() didn't fill in the type, so %pR didn't know how to
print it.
