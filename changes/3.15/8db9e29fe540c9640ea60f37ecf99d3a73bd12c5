pwm: atmel: Fix polarity handling

When atmel_pwm_config() calculates and then sets the prescaler, it is
overwriting the channel's CMR register so we are losing the CPOL
configuration.

As atmel_pwm_config() is always called before enabling a channel,
inverting the polarity doesn't work.

Fix that by reading CMR first and only overwriting the prescaler bits.
