ARM: mvebu: Allows to get the SoC ID even without PCI enabled

The address translation of a PCI node don't require anymore the PCI
support in the kernel. This translation is mandatory to be able to
read the SoC ID which is stored in the PCI controller of the mvebu
SoCs.

This patch selects the symbol needed to get only this translation for
all the mvebu platforms.
