rcu: Optimize RCU_FAST_NO_HZ for RCU_NOCB_CPU_ALL

If CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_ALL=y, then no CPU will ever have RCU callbacks
because these callbacks will instead be handled by the rcuo kthreads.
However, the current version of RCU_FAST_NO_HZ nevertheless checks for RCU
callbacks.  This commit therefore creates static inline implementations
of rcu_prepare_for_idle() and rcu_cleanup_after_idle() that are no-ops
when CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_ALL=y.
