powerpc: Fix 64 bit builds with binutils 2.24

With binutils 2.24, various 64 bit builds fail with relocation errors
such as

arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o: In function `exc_debug_crit_book3e':
	(.text+0x165ee): relocation truncated to fit: R_PPC64_ADDR16_HI
	against symbol `interrupt_base_book3e' defined in .text section
	in arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o
arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o: In function `exc_debug_crit_book3e':
	(.text+0x16602): relocation truncated to fit: R_PPC64_ADDR16_HI
	against symbol `interrupt_end_book3e' defined in .text section
	in arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o

The assembler maintainer says:

 I changed the ABI, something that had to be done but unfortunately
 happens to break the booke kernel code.  When building up a 64-bit
 value with lis, ori, shl, oris, ori or similar sequences, you now
 should use @high and @higha in place of @h and @ha.  @h and @ha
 (and their associated relocs R_PPC64_ADDR16_HI and R_PPC64_ADDR16_HA)
 now report overflow if the value is out of 32-bit signed range.
 ie. @h and @ha assume you're building a 32-bit value. This is needed
 to report out-of-range -mcmodel=medium toc pointer offsets in @toc@h
 and @toc@ha expressions, and for consistency I did the same for all
 other @h and @ha relocs.

Replacing @h with @high in one strategic location fixes the relocation
errors. This has to be done conditionally since the assembler either
supports @h or @high but not both.
