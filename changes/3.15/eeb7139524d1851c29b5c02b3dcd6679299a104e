spi: sirf: provide a shortcut for spi command-data mode

there are many SPI clients which use the following protocal:
step 1: send command bytes to clients(rx buffer is empty)
step 2: send data bytes to clients or receive data bytes from
clients.
SiRFprimaII provides a shortcut for this kind of SPI transfer.
when tx buf is less or equal than 4 bytes and rx buf is null
in a transfer, we think it as 'command' data and use hardware
command register for the transfer.
here we can save some CPU loading than doing both tx and rx
for a normal transfer.
