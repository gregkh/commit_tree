dentry_kill(): don't try to remove from shrink list

If the victim in on the shrink list, don't remove it from there.
If shrink_dentry_list() manages to remove it from the list before
we are done - fine, we'll just free it as usual.  If not - mark
it with new flag (DCACHE_MAY_FREE) and leave it there.

Eventually, shrink_dentry_list() will get to it, remove the sucker
from shrink list and call dentry_kill(dentry, 0).  Which is where
we'll deal with freeing.

Since now dentry_kill(dentry, 0) may happen after or during
dentry_kill(dentry, 1), we need to recognize that (by seeing
DCACHE_DENTRY_KILLED already set), unlock everything
and either free the sucker (in case DCACHE_MAY_FREE has been
set) or leave it for ongoing dentry_kill(dentry, 1) to deal with.
