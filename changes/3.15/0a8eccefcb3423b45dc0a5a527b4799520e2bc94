KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add missing code for transaction reclaim on guest exit

Testing by Michael Neuling revealed that commit e4e38121507a ("KVM:
PPC: Book3S HV: Add transactional memory support") is missing the code
that saves away the checkpointed state of the guest when switching to
the host.  This adds that code, which was in earlier versions of the
patch but went missing somehow.
