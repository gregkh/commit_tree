mtd: st_spi_fsm: Provide a method to put the chip into 32bit addressing mode

Most Serial Flash chips support 24bit addressing as a default but more
recent incarnations can support 32bit. Based on information provided
though platform specific data and capabilities we can determine whether
or not our current chip can. This patch provides a means to setup the
FSM message sequence to put the chip into 32bit mode.
