mmc: omap_hsmmc: Add support for quirky omap3 hsmmc controller

When device is booted using devicetree, platforms impacted by Erratum
2.1.1.128 is not detected easily in the mmc driver. This erratum
indicates that the module cannot do multi-block transfers. Platforms
such as LDP which use OMAP3 ES revision prior to ES3.0 are impacted by
this.

Provide a new compatible property "ti,omap3-pre-es3-hsmmc" to allow
driver to determine if driver needs to implement quirks associated
with the specific module version (primarily because the IP revision
information is not sufficient for the same).
