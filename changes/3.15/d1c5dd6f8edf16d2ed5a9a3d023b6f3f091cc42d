usb: wusbcore: add info to HWA debug prints

This patch adds a debug print in the transfer dequeue case where a
transfer result arrives for a transfer that has already been cleaned up.
It also adds the transfer ID to some debug prints and prints error codes
as signed integers in a couple of others.
