ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Simplify disable_slot()

After recent PCI core changes related to the rescan/remove locking,
the ACPIPHP's disable_slot() function is only called under the
general PCI rescan/remove lock, so it doesn't have to use
dev_in_slot() any more to avoid race conditions.  Make it simply
walk the devices on the bus and drop the ones in the slot being
disabled and drop dev_in_slot() which has no more users.

Moreover, to avoid problems described in the changelog of commit
29ed1f29b68a (PCI: pciehp: Fix null pointer deref when hot-removing
SR-IOV device), make disable_slot() carry out the list walk in
reverse order.
