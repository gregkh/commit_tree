lib/clz_ctz.c: add prototype declarations in lib/clz_ctz.c

Add prototype declarations of functions in lib/clz_ctz.c.  These
functions are required by GCC builtins and hence can not be removed
despite of their unreferenced appearance in kernel source.

This eliminates the following warning in lib/clz_ctz.c:

  lib/clz_ctz.c:16:12: warning: no previous prototype for `__ctzsi2' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
  lib/clz_ctz.c:22:12: warning: no previous prototype for `__clzsi2' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
  lib/clz_ctz.c:44:12: warning: no previous prototype for `__clzdi2' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
  lib/clz_ctz.c:50:12: warning: no previous prototype for `__ctzdi2' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
