x86: Fix typo preventing msr_set/clear_bit from having an effect

Due to a typo the msr accessor function introduced in
22085a66c2fab6cf9b9393c056a3600a6b4735de didn't have any lasting
effects because they accidentally wrote the old value back.

After c0a639ad0bc6b178b46996bd1f821a04643e2bde this at the very least
this causes cpuid limits not to be lifted on some cpus leading to
missing capabilities for those.
