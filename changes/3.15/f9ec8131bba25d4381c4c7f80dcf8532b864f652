cxgb3: Call dev_kfree/consume_skb_any instead of [dev_]kfree_skb.

Replace kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in free_tx_desc, and
write_tx_pkt_wr that can be called in hard irq and other contexts.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_kfree_skb_any in t3_eth_xmit that can
be called in hard irq and other contexts.

dev_kfree_skb is replaced with dev_kfree_skb_any in t3_eth_xmit as
that location is a packet drop, while kfree_skb in free_tx_desc,
and in write_tx_pkt_wr are places where packets are consumed
in a healthy manner.
