bnx2x: utilize FW 7.8.19

    This new firmware fixes following bugs:
     1. HW attention appears and traffic stops when iSCSI firmware tries to
        retransmit iSCSI login command when the iSCSI login is carrying data
        not aligned to 4-bytes.
     2. FCoE traffic fails to run when running in switch-independent multi-function
        mode and there's more than one interface supporting FCoE on a given port.
     3. While two ports are running FCoE with at least one of them has a function
        number (>1) on the same engine in a 4-port device a zeroed CQE is given,
        causing FCoE traffic to stop.
