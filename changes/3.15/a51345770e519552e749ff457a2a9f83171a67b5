ARM: 7987/1: ARM : unwinder : Prevent data abort due to stack overflow

While unwinding backtrace, stack overflow is possible. This stack
overflow can sometimes lead to data abort in system if the area after
stack is not mapped to physical memory.

To prevent this problem from happening, execute the instructions that
can cause a data abort in separate helper functions, where a check for
feasibility is made before reading each word from the stack.
