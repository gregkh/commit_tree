rcutorture: Abstract torture_create_kthread()

Creation of kthreads is not RCU-specific, so this commit abstracts
out torture_create_kthread(), saving a few tens of lines of code in
the process.

This change requires modifying VERBOSE_TOROUT_ERRSTRING() to take a
non-const string, so that _torture_create_kthread() can avoid an
open-coded substitute.
