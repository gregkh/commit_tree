can: move sanity check for bitrate and tq into can_get_bittiming

This patch moves a sanity check in order to have a second user for CAN FD.
Also simplify the return value generation in can_get_bittiming() as only
correct return values of can_[calc|fixup]_bittiming() lead to a return value of
zero.
