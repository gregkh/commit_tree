mtd: st_spi_fsm: Provide the default read/write configurations

Message sequences can vary depending on how many pads (lines) are
required to address the chip (mode & dummy), how many data pads (lines)
are required to write out to the chip which will determine speed
amongst other things which are detailed by the SFDP specification. We
are able to use multiple configurations for each chip, but they need
to me matched to a device's capabilities. These configurations are
listed in preference order - most preferred first.
