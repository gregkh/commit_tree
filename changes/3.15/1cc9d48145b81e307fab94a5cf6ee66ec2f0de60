ARM: orion5x: fix target ID for crypto SRAM window

In commit 4ca2c04085a1caa903e92a5fc0da25362150aac2 ('ARM: orion5x:
Move to ID based window creation'), the mach-orion5x code was changed
to use the new mvebu-mbus API. However, in the process, a mistake was
made on the crypto SRAM window target ID: it should have been 0x9
(verified in the datasheet) and not 0x0.
