drm/exynos: Rename display_op power_on to dpms

This patch renames the display_op power_on to dpms to accurately reflect
what the function does.

The side-effect of this patch is that the new hdmi dpms callback is now
invoked twice in the dpms path. This is safe and will be dealt with when
the exynos_drm shim goes away.
