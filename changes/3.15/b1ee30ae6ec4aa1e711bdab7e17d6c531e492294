Revert a02bbb1ccfe8: MAINTAINERS: add virtio-dev ML for virtio

The OASIS virtio-dev mailing list is a good place for implementers to
discuss details of the standard, but it requires subscription to avoid
IP issues :(

It makes more sense to stick with the
virtualization@lists.linux-foundation.org mailing list for bug
reports.  We can refer to the OASIS list if it involves a question on
the standard itself.
