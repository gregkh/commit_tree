checkpatch: fix spurious vendor compatible warnings

With a compatible string like

  compatible = "foo";

checkpatch will currently try to find "foo" in vendor-prefixes.txt,
which is wrong since the vendor prefix is empty in this specific case.

Skip the vendor test if the compatible is not like

  compatible = "vendor,something";
