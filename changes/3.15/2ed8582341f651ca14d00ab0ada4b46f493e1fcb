PCI: Clarify the "scan anyway" comment in pci_scan_bridge()

Initially when we encountered a bus that was already present we skipped
it. Since 74710ded8e16 'PCI: always scan child buses' we continue
scanning in order to allow user triggered rescans of already existing
busses.

The old comment suggested that the reason for continuing the scan is a
bug in the i450NX chipset. This is not the case.
