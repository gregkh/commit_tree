net: filter: keep original BPF program around

In order to open up the possibility to internally transform a BPF program
into an alternative and possibly non-trivial reversible representation, we
need to keep the original BPF program around, so that it can be passed back
to user space w/o the need of a complex decoder.

The reason for that use case resides in commit a8fc92778080 ("sk-filter:
Add ability to get socket filter program (v2)"), that is, the ability
to retrieve the currently attached BPF filter from a given socket used
mainly by the checkpoint-restore project, for example.

Therefore, we add two helpers sk_{store,release}_orig_filter for taking
care of that. In the sk_unattached_filter_create() case, there's no such
possibility/requirement to retrieve a loaded BPF program. Therefore, we
can spare us the work in that case.

This approach will simplify and slightly speed up both, sk_get_filter()
and sock_diag_put_filterinfo() handlers as we won't need to successively
decode filters anymore through sk_decode_filter(). As we still need
sk_decode_filter() later on, we're keeping it around.
