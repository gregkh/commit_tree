fuse: trust kernel i_ctime only

Let the kernel maintain i_ctime locally: update i_ctime explicitly on
truncate, fallocate, open(O_TRUNC), setxattr, removexattr, link, rename,
unlink.

The inode flag I_DIRTY_SYNC serves as indication that local i_ctime should
be flushed to the server eventually.  The patch sets the flag and updates
i_ctime in course of operations listed above.
