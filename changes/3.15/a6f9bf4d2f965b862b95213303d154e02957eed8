libata: clean up ZPODD when a port is detached

When a ZPODD device is unbound via sysfs, the ACPI notify handler
is not removed. This causes panics as observed in Bug #74601. The
panic only happens when the wake happens from outside the kernel
(i.e. inserting a media or pressing a button). Add a loop to
ata_port_detach which loops through the port's devices and checks
if zpodd is enabled, if so call zpodd_exit.
