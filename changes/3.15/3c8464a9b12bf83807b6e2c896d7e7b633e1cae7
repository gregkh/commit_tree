powerpc: Delete old PrPMC 280/2800 support

This processor/memory module was mostly used on ATCA blades and
before that, on cPCI blades.  It wasn't really user friendly, with
custom non u-boot bootloaders (powerboot/motload) and no real way
to recover corrupted boot flash (which was a common problem).

As such, it had its day back before the big ppc --> powerpc move
to device trees, and that was largely through commercial BSPs that
started to dry up around 2007.

Systems using one were largely in a "deploy and sustain" mode,
so interest in upgrading to new kernels in the field was nil.
Also, requiring 50A, 48V power supplies and a 2'x2'x2' ATCA
chassis largely rules out any hobbyist/enthusiast interest.

The point of all this, is that we might as well delete the in
kernel files relating to this platform.  No point in continuing
to build it via walking the defconfigs or via linux-next testing.
