lib/decompress_inflate.c: include appropriate header file

Include appropriate header file include/linux/decompress/inflate.h in
lib/decompress_inflate.c because it has prototype declaration of
function defined in lib/decompress_inflate.c.

Also, fix the guard around the header file
include/linux/decompress/inflate.h to use a more unique guard symbol.
This avoids conflict with the INFLATE_H defined by
zlib_inflate/inflate.h.

This eliminates the following warning in lib/decompress_inflate.c:

  lib/decompress_inflate.c:35:17: warning: no previous prototype for `gunzip' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
