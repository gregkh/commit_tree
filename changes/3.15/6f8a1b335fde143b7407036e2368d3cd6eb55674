x86: Adjust irq remapping quirk for older revisions of 5500/5520 chipsets

Commit 03bbcb2e7e2 (iommu/vt-d: add quirk for broken interrupt
remapping on 55XX chipsets) properly disables irq remapping on the
5500/5520 chipsets that don't correctly perform that feature.

However, when I wrote it, I followed the errata sheet linked in that
commit too closely, and explicitly tied the activation of the quirk to
revision 0x13 of the chip, under the assumption that earlier revisions
were not in the field.  Recently a system was reported to be suffering
from this remap bug and the quirk hadn't triggered, because the
revision id register read at a lower value that 0x13, so the quirk
test failed improperly.  Given this, it seems only prudent to adjust
this quirk so that any revision less than 0x13 has the quirk asserted.

[ tglx: Removed the 0x12 comparison of pci id 3405 as this is covered
    	by the <= 0x13 check already ]
