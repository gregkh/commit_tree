gianfar: Fix P1010 config regression (SQ polling)

The P1010 device tree restricts the number of
supported interrupt groups to 1, although the eth
controller can support 2 interrupt groups and the
driver assumes the Multi-Group mode ("fsl,etsec2" model).

So, in this case the assumption that the Multi-Group
mode (MQ_MG_MODE) devices always support 2 interrupt
groups is false.  To fix this, a check for the actual
number of interrupt groups enabled in the board's
device tree has been added in gfar_probe for the
"fsl,etsec2" devices.

Without this fix, P1010 based boards claim support for
2 Tx queues to the net stack but only one is actually
allocated, leading to NULL access in xmit.  This issue
was introduced by enabling Single-Queue polling for
the P1010 devices.

"fsl,etsec2")
