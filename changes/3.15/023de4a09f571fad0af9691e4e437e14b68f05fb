x86/apic: Reinstate error IRQ Pentium erratum 3AP workaround

A change introduced with commit 60283df7ac26a4fe2d56631ca2946e04725e7eaf
("x86/apic: Read Error Status Register correctly") removed a read from the
APIC ESR register made before writing to same required to retrieve the
correct error status on Pentium systems affected by the 3AP erratum[1]:

	"3AP. Writes to Error Register Clears Register

	PROBLEM: The APIC Error register is intended to only be read.
	If there is a write to this register the data in the APIC Error
	register will be cleared and lost.

	IMPLICATION: There is a possibility of clearing the Error
	register status since the write to the register is not
	specifically blocked.

	WORKAROUND: Writes should not occur to the Pentium processor
	APIC Error register.

	STATUS: For the steppings affected see the Summary Table of
	Changes at the beginning of this section."

The steppings affected are actually: B1, B3 and B5.

To avoid this information loss this change avoids the write to
ESR on all Pentium systems where it is actually never needed;
in Pentium processor documentation ESR was noted read-only and
the write only required for future architectural
compatibility[2].

The approach taken is the same as in lapic_setup_esr().
