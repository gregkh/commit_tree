ARM: dts: i.MX53: add support for MCIMX53-START-R

The "Start-R QSB" has a different PMIC than the older "Start QSB".
Add a new devicetree for the Start-R.
They both could use the same DT, as both PMICs (the dialog and the mc34708)
have different i2c addresses and could coexist in the same DT without any
errors. But once phandles are used, this will get messy.

The pmic nodes are based on an earlier patch

	[PATCH] arm: imx53-qsb: Add Ripley driver DT nodes

from

	Ying-Chun Liu (PaulLiu) <paul.liu@linaro.org>

which apparently got lost/abandoned.

I added phandles/newlines and changed the node name from ripley to mc34708.
