[media] e4000: fix PLL calc to allow higher frequencies

There was 32-bit overflow on VCO frequency calculation which blocks
tuning to 1073 - 1104 MHz. Use 64 bit number in order to avoid VCO
frequency overflow.

After that fix device in question tunes to following range:
60 - 1104 MHz
1250 - 2207 MHz
