clk: shmobile: rcar-gen2: fix lb/sd0/sd1/sdh clock parent to pll1

The clock generator for rcar-gen2 has the lb, sdh, sd0 and sd1 clocks
parented to pll1_div2 where the hardware diagram shows these to be
directly fed from pll1.

This fixes the initial rate for sdh0 clock to be 97.5MHz instead of
the reported 48MHz where the manual says the default register values
are for 97.5MHz.
