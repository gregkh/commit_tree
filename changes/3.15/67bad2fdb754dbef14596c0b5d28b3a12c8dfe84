cpu: add generic support for CPU feature based module autoloading

This patch adds support for advertising optional CPU features over udev
using the modalias, and for declaring compatibility with/dependency upon
such a feature in a module.

The mapping between feature numbers and actual features should be provided
by the architecture in a file called <asm/cpufeature.h> which exports the
following functions/macros:
- cpu_feature(FEAT), a preprocessor macro that maps token FEAT to a
  numeric index;
- bool cpu_have_feature(n), returning whether this CPU has support for
  feature #n;
- MAX_CPU_FEATURES, an upper bound for 'n' in the previous function.

The feature can then be enabled by setting CONFIG_GENERIC_CPU_AUTOPROBE
for the architecture.

For instance, a module that registers its module init function using

  module_cpu_feature_match(FEAT_X, module_init_function)

will be probed automatically when the CPU's support for the 'FEAT_X'
feature is advertised over udev, and will only allow the module to be
loaded by hand if the 'FEAT_X' feature is supported.
