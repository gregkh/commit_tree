iwlwifi: mvm: disable power on P2P client when BSS is added

When power update is initiated on BSS STA while P2P client
exists, the power command will be sent only on BSS STA vif
ignoring P2P client.

Since the firmware has symmetric constraints on the power
save enablement we can simplify the code a bit.

The current firmware doesn't know how to enable power
management on P2P client. Even BSS power management must
be disabled when a P2P client is added.

Future firmware will support power save on BSS and P2P client
as long as they are on different channels.
This was buggy since we didn't disable power management on
P2P client interface if BSS added on the same channel.
