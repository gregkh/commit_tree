ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: fix missing braces in _init()

Bug was introduced by commit 'f92d959: ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod:
Extract no-idle and no-reset info from DT'

There were 2 versions of the patch posted which resulted in the above
commit. While v1 [1] had the bug, v2 [2] had it fixed.
However v1 apparently seemed to have been pulled in by mistake
introducing the bug.

Given of_find_property() does return NULL when the node passed is
NULL, it did not introduce any functional issues as such, just the
fact that the second if check was executed unnecessarily.
