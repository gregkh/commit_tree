x86, boot: Move memcmp() into string.h and string.c

Try to treat memcmp() in same way as memcpy() and memset(). Provide a
declaration in boot/string.h and by default user gets a memcmp() which
maps to builtin function.

Move optimized definition of memcmp() in boot/string.c. Now a user can
do #undef memcmp and link against string.c to use optimzied memcmp().

It also simplifies boot/compressed/string.c where we had to redefine
memcmp(). That extra definition is gone now.
