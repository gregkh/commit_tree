Make some local functions static and fix coding style in these function
declarations when It is necessary

These are the local functions that were made static:
rtl8192_CalculateBitShift, rtl8192_phy_RFSerialRead,
rtl8192_phy_RFSerialWrite, rtl8192_InitBBRFRegDef,
rtl8192_BB_Config_ParaFile,rtl8192_SetTxPowerLevel,
rtl8192_phy_SetSwChnlCmdArray, rtl8192_phy_SwChnlStepByStep,
rtl8192_phy_FinishSwChnlNow

Fixed the following sparse warnings in r819xU_phy.c
