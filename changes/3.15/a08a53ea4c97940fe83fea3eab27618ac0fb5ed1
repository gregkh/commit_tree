powerpc/le: Enable RTAS events support

The current kernel code assumes big endian and parses RTAS events all
wrong. The most visible effect is that we cannot honor EPOW events,
meaning, for example, we cannot shut down a guest properly from the
hypervisor.

This new patch is largely inspired by Nathan's work: we get rid of all
the bit fields in the RTAS event structures (even the unused ones, for
consistency). We also introduce endian safe accessors for the fields used
by the kernel (trivial rtas_error_type() accessor added for consistency).
