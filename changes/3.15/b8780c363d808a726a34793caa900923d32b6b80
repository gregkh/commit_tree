sched: remove sleep_on() and friends

This is the final piece in the puzzle, as all patches to remove the
last users of \(interruptible_\|\)sleep_on\(_timeout\|\) have made it
into the 3.15 merge window. The work was long overdue, and this
interface in particular should not have survived the BKL removal
that was done a couple of years ago.

Citing Jon Corbet from http://lwn.net/2001/0201/kernel.php3":

 "[...] it was suggested that the janitors look for and fix all code
  that calls sleep_on() [...] since (1) almost all such code is
  incorrect, and (2) Linus has agreed that those functions should
  be removed in the 2.5 development series".

We haven't quite made it for 2.5, but maybe we can merge this for 3.15.
