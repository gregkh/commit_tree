HID: sensor-hub: add sensor hub quirk for ThinkPad Helix

Just like some of the other laptops/tablets on the market with ultrabook
sensors, the ThinkPad Helix's sensor hub requires a special quirk in
order for it to power on properly. Without it the sensors are detected
by the kernel and set up as usual, but they won't output any data. This
will also fix the sensors on any other laptops with the same model of
sensor hub.
