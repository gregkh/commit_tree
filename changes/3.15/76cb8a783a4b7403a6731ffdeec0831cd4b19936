powerpc/perf: Enable BHRB access for EBB events

The previous commit added constraint and register handling to allow
processes using EBB (Event Based Branches) to request access to the BHRB
(Branch History Rolling Buffer).

With that in place we can allow processes using EBB to access the BHRB.
This is achieved by setting BHRBA in MMCR0 when we enable EBB access. We
must also clear BHRBA when we are disabling.
