Bluetooth: Directly close dlc for not yet started RFCOMM session

If the RFCOMM session has not yet been started (ie., session is
still in BT_BOUND state) when a dlc is closed, directly close and
unlink the dlc rather than sending a DISC frame that is never
sent.

This allows the dlci to be immediately reused rather than waiting
for a 20 second timeout.
