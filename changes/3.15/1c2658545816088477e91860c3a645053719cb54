ipv6: fib: fix fib dump restart

When the ipv6 fib changes during a table dump, the walk is
restarted and the number of nodes dumped are skipped. But the existing
code doesn't advance to the next node after a node is skipped. This can
cause the dump to loop or produce lots of duplicates when the fib
is modified during the dump.

This change advances the walk to the next node if the current node is
skipped after a restart.
