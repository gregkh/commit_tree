[SCSI] ipr: Handle early EEH

If, when the ipr driver loads, the adapter is in an EEH error state,
it will currently oops and not be able to recover, as it attempts
to access memory that has not yet been allocated. We've seen this
occur in some kexec scenarios. The following patch fixes the oops
and also allows the driver to recover from these probe time EEH errors.
