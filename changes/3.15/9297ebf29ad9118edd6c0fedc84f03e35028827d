drm/i915: Do not dereference pointers from ring buffer in evict event

The TP_printk() should never dereference any pointers, because the ring
buffer can be read at some unknown time in the future. If a device no
longer exists, it can cause a kernel oops. This also makes this
event useless when saving the ring buffer in userspaces tools such as
perf and trace-cmd.

The i915_gem_evict_vm dereferences the vm pointer which may also not
exist when the ring buffer is read sometime in the future.
