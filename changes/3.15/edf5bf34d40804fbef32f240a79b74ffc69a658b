ACPI / dock: Use callback pointers from devices' ACPI hotplug contexts

Instead of requiring a set of special dock operations to be registered
via register_hotplug_dock_device() for each ACPI dock device, it is
much more straightforward to use callback pointers from the devices'
hotplug contexts if available.

For this reason, modify dock_hotplug_event() to use callback pointers
from the hotplug contexts of ACPI devices and fall back to using the
special dock operarions only if those callbacks are missing.  Also
make the ACPI-based PCI hotplug (ACPIPHP) subsystem set the .fixup
callback pointer in the hotplug contexts of devices handled by it to
a new function, acpiphp_post_dock_fixup(), so that the dock station
driver can use the callbacks from those contexts instead of special
dock operations registered via register_hotplug_dock_device().

Along with the above changes drop the ACPIPHP's dock operations that
are not necessary any more.
