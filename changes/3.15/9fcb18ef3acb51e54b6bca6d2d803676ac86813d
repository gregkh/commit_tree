Bluetooth: Introduce LE auto connect options

This patch introduces the LE auto connection options: HCI_AUTO_CONN_
ALWAYS and HCI_AUTO_CONN_LINK_LOSS. Their working mechanism are
described as follows:

The HCI_AUTO_CONN_ALWAYS option configures the kernel to always re-
establish the connection, no matter the reason the connection was
terminated. This feature is required by some LE profiles such as
HID over GATT, Health Thermometer and Blood Pressure. These profiles
require the host autonomously connect to the device as soon as it
enters in connectable mode (start advertising) so the device is able
to delivery notifications or indications.

The BT_AUTO_CONN_LINK_LOSS option configures the kernel to re-
establish the connection in case the connection was terminated due
to a link loss. This feature is required by the majority of LE
profiles such as Proximity, Find Me, Cycling Speed and Cadence and
Time.
