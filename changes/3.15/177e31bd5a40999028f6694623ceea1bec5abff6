IB/iser: Support T10-PI operations

Add logic to initialize protection information entities.  Upon each
iSCSI task, we keep the scsi_cmnd in order to query the scsi
protection operations and reference to protection buffers.

Modify iser_fast_reg_mr to receive indication whether it is
registering the data or protection buffers.

In addition introduce iser_reg_sig_mr which performs fast registration
work-request for a signature enabled memory region
(IB_WR_REG_SIG_MR).  In this routine we set all the protection
relevants for the device to offload protection data-transfer and
verification.
