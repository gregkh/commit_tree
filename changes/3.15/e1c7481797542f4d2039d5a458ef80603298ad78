ACPI / LPSS: Add Intel BayTrail ACPI mode PWM

Intel BayTrail LPSS consists of two PWM controllers which can
be enumerated from ACPI namespace. This change will cause
platform device objects to be created for Intel BayTrail PWM
controllers which will allow the pwm-lpss driver to bind to them
and handle those devices.
