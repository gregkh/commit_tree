[media] rc: img-ir: add hardware decoder driver

Add remote control input driver for the ImgTec Infrared block hardware
decoder, which is set up with timings for a specific protocol and
supports mask/value filtering and wake events.

The hardware decoder timing values, raw data to scan code conversion
function and scan code filter to raw data filter conversion function
will be provided in separate files for each protocol which this part of
the driver can use. The new generic scan code filter interface is made
use of to reduce interrupts and control wake events.
