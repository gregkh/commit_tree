x86, acpi: LLVMLinux: Remove nested functions from Thinkpad ACPI

The only real change is passing in event_mask to the formerly nested functions.
Otherwise it's just moving around function and macro code.

This is the only place in the Linux kernel where nested functions are still in
use. Nested functions aren't part of the C standards, and complicate the
generated code. Although the Linux Kernel has never set out to be entirely C
standard compliant, it is increasingly compliant to the standard which is
supported by other compilers such as Clang. The LLVMLinux project is working on
being able to compile the Linux kernel with Clang. The use of nested functions
blocks this effort.
