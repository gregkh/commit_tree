cgroup: reorganize cgroup bootstrapping

* Fields of init_css_set and css_set_count are now set using
  initializer instead of programmatically from cgroup_init_early().

* init_cgroup_root() now also takes @opts and performs the optional
  part of initialization too.  The leftover part of
  cgroup_root_from_opts() is collapsed into its only caller -
  cgroup_mount().

* Initialization of cgroup_root_count and linking of init_css_set are
  moved from cgroup_init_early() to to cgroup_init().  None of the
  early_init users depends on init_css_set being linked.

* Subsystem initializations are moved after dummy hierarchy init and
  init_css_set linking.

These changes reorganize the bootstrap logic so that the dummy
hierarchy can share the usual hierarchy init path and be made more
normal.  These changes don't make noticeable behavior changes.
