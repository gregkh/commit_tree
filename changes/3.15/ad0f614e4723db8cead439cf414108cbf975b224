wait: swap EXIT_ZOMBIE(Z) and EXIT_DEAD(X) chars in TASK_STATE_TO_CHAR_STR

In commit ad86622b478e ("wait: swap EXIT_ZOMBIE and EXIT_DEAD to hide
EXIT_TRACE from user-space") the order of task state definitions were
changed: EXIT_DEAD and EXIT_ZOMBIE were swapped.  Though the charterers
for the states in TASK_STATE_TO_CHAR_STR string were not updated.  This
patch synchronizes the string to the order of definitions.
