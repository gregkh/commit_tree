x86, boot: Create a separate string.h file to provide standard string functions

Create a separate arch/x86/boot/string.h file to provide declaration of
some of the common string functions.

By default memcpy, memset and memcmp functions will default to gcc
builtin functions. If code wants to use an optimized version of any
of these functions, they need to #undef the respective macro and link
against a local file providing definition of undefed function.

For example, arch/x86/boot/* code links against copy.S to get memcpy()
and memcmp() definitions. arch/86/boot/compressed/* links against
compressed/string.c.

There are quite a few places in arch/x86/ where these functions are
used. Idea is to try to consilidate  their declaration and possibly
definitions so that it can be reused.

I am planning to reuse boot/string.h in arch/x86/purgatory/ and use
gcc builtin functions for memcpy, memset and memcmp.
