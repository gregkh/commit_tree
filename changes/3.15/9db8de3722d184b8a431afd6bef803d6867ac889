cgroup: cosmetic updates to cgroup_attach_task()

cgroup_attach_task() is planned to go through restructuring.  Let's
tidy it up a bit in preparation.

* Update cgroup_attach_task() to receive the target task argument in
  @leader instead of @tsk.

* Rename @tsk to @task.

* Rename @retval to @ret.

This is purely cosmetic.

v2: get_nr_threads() was using uninitialized @task instead of @leader.
    Fixed.  Reported by Dan Carpenter.
