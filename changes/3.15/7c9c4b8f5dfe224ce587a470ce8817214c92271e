    drm/i915: Permit contexts on all rings

We don't actually need this, only the internal changes to allow
contexts on all rings for the purpose of ppgtt switching are required.
And I'm not sure whether this is the right thing to do given some of
the hw features in the pipeline.

Also, new abi needs userspace patches as a proof-of-need, which is
completely lacking here.
