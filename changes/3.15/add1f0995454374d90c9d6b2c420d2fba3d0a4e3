fs: Substitute rcu_access_pointer() for rcu_dereference_raw()

(Trivial patch.)

If the code is looking at the RCU-protected pointer itself, but not
dereferencing it, the rcu_dereference() functions can be downgraded to
rcu_access_pointer().  This commit makes this downgrade in __alloc_fd(),
which simply compares the RCU-protected pointer against NULL with no
dereferencing.
