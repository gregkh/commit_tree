dm: stop using bi_private

Device mapper uses the bio structure's bi_private field as a pointer
to dm_target_io or dm_rq_clone_bio_info.  But a bio structure is
embedded in the dm_target_io and dm_rq_clone_bio_info structures, so the
pointer to the structure that contains the bio can be found with the
container_of() macro.

Remove the use of bi_private and use container_of() instead.
