x86: align x86 arch with generic CPU modalias handling

The x86 CPU feature modalias handling existed before it was reimplemented
generically. This patch aligns the x86 handling so that it
(a) reuses some more code that is now generic;
(b) uses the generic format for the modalias module metadata entry, i.e., it
    now uses 'cpu:type:x86,venVVVVfamFFFFmodMMMM:feature:,XXXX,YYYY' instead of
    the 'x86cpu:vendor:VVVV:family:FFFF:model:MMMM:feature:,XXXX,YYYY' that was
    used before.
