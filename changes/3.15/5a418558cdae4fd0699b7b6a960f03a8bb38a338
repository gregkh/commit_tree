rtc: pm8xxx: add support for devicetree

Add support for describing the PM8921/PM8058 RTC in device tree.

Additionally:
   - drop support for describing the RTC using platform data,
     as there are no current in tree users who do so.
   - make allow_set_time a device-specific flag, instead of mucking
     with the rtc_ops
