drm/i915: Restore rps/rc6 on reset

A check of rps/rc6 state after i915_reset determined that the ring
MAX_IDLE registers were returned to their hardware defaults and that
the GEN6_PMIMR register was set to mask all interrupts. This change
restores those values to their pre-reset states by re-initializing
rps/rc6 in i915_reset. A full re-initialization was opted for versus
a targeted set of restore operations for simplicity and maintain-
ability. Note that the re-initialization is not done for Ironlake,
due to a past comment that it causes problems.

Also updated the rps initialization sequence to preserve existing
min/max values in the case of a re-init. We assume the values were
validated upon being set and do not do further range checking. The
debugfs interface for changing min/max was updated with range
checking to ensure this condition (already present in sysfs
interface).

v2: fix rps logging to output hw_max and hw_min, not rps.max_delay
    and rps.min_delay which don't strictly represent hardware limits.
    Add igt testcase to signed-off-by section.
