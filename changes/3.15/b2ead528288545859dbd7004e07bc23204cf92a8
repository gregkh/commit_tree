MIPS: Move & rename fpu_emulator_{save,restore}_context

These functions aren't directly related to the FPU emulator at all, they
simply copy between a thread's saved context & a sigcontext. Thus move
them to the appropriate signal files & rename them accordingly. This
makes it clearer that the functions don't require the FPU emulator in
any way.
