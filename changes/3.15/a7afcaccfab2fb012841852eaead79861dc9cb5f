[media] vb2: don't init the list if there are still buffers

__vb2_queue_free() would init the queued_list at all times, even if
q->num_buffers > 0. This should only happen if num_buffers == 0.

This situation can happen if a CREATE_BUFFERS call couldn't allocate
enough buffers and had to free those it did manage to allocate before
returning an error.

While we're at it: __vb2_queue_alloc() returns the number of buffers
allocated, not an error code. So stick the result in allocated_buffers
instead of ret as that's very confusing.
