spi: rspi: Add support for more than one interrupt

Add support for multiple interrupts, based on the SDK reference code.
This is needed for RZ/A1H, which supports 3 interrupts.

When using multiple interrupts, they must be called "rx" (SPRI) and "tx"
(SPTI). The error interrupt (SPEI) is not used, as it matters for slave
mode only.

When using a single interrupt, it may be called "mux". If it cannot be
found, the first interrupt in the device's resources will be used.
