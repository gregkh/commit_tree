phy: core: Add an exported of_phy_get function

Previously the of_phy_get function took a struct device * and
was declared static. It was impossible to call it from
another driver and thus it was impossible to get phy defined
for a given node. The old function was renamed to _of_phy_get
and was left for internal use. of_phy_get function was added
and it was exported. The function enables to get a phy for
a given device tree node.
