drm/i915/bdw: Free PPGTT struct

GEN8 never freed the PPGTT struct. As GEN8 doesn't use full PPGTT, the
leak is small and only found on a module reload. ie. I don't think this
needs to go to stable.

v2: The very naive, kfree in gen8 ppgtt cleanup, is subject to a double
free on PPGTT initialization failure. (Spotted by Imre). Instead this
patch pulls the ppgtt struct freeing out of the cleanup and leaves it to
the allocators/callers or the one doing the last kref_put as in standard
convention
