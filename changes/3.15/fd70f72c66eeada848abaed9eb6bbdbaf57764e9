net: phy: add MoCA PHY type

Some Ethernet MACs are connected to a MoCA PHY which will handle the
low-level job of sending Ethernet frames on the coaxial cable, these
Ethernet MACs need to know about it to be properly configured.
Add a new PHY mode "moca" and update the Device Tree parsing logic to
look for it.
