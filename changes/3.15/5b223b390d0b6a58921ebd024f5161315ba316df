[media] drx-j: get rid of the typedefs on bsp_i2c.h

Most of the hard work here were done by this small script:

for i in *; do sed s,pI2CDeviceAddr_t,"struct i2c_device_addr *",g <$i >a && mv a $i; done
for i in *; do sed s,I2CDeviceAddr_t,"struct i2c_device_addr",g <$i >a && mv a $i; done

Only bsp_i2c.h were added by hand.
