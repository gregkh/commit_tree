mmc: slot-gpio: Add GPIO descriptor based CD GPIO API

Add functions to request a CD GPIO using the GPIO descriptor API.
Note that the new request function is paired with mmc_gpiod_free_cd()
not mmc_gpio_free_cd().  Note also that it must be called prior to
mmc_add_host() otherwise the caller must also call
mmc_gpiod_request_cd_irq().
