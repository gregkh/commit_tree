[media] vivi: fix sequence counting

The sequence counting was not reset to 0 between each streaming run,
and it was increased only every other frame. This is incorrect behavior:
the confusion is with FIELD_ALTERNATE systems where each field is transmitted
separately and only when both fields have been received is the frame
sequence number increased.
