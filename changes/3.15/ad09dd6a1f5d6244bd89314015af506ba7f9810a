mfd: max77693: Fix possible NULL pointer dereference on i2c_new_dummy error

During probe the driver allocates dummy I2C devices for MUIC and haptic
with i2c_new_dummy() but it does not check the return value of this
calls.

In case of error (i2c_new_device(): memory allocation failure or I2C
address cannot be used) this function returns NULL which is later used
by devm_regmap_init_i2c() and i2c_unregister_device().

If i2c_new_dummy() fails for MUIC or haptic devices, fail also the probe
for main MFD driver.
