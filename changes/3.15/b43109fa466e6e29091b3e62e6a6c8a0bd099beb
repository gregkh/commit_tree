ACPI / dock: Pass ACPI device pointer to acpi_device_is_battery()

Since we already know what the device's PNP IDs are when
acpi_device_is_battery() is called, it is not necessary to run
acpi_get_object_info() for the device in that function.  Instead, if
acpi_device_is_battery() is passed a pointer to a struct acpi_device
object, it can use the list of PNP IDs from that object, so make that
happen and modify the function's header accordingly
