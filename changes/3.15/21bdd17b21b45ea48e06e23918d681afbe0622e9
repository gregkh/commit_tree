module: allow multiple calls to MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() per module

Commit 78551277e4df5: "Input: i8042 - add PNP modaliases" had a bug, where the
second call to MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() overrode the first resulting in not all
the modaliases being exposed.

This fixes the problem by including the name of the device_id table in the
__mod_*_device_table alias, allowing us to export several device_id tables
per module.
