dealing with the rest of shrink_dentry_list() livelock

We have the same problem with ->d_lock order in the inner loop, where
we are dropping references to ancestors.  Same solution, basically -
instead of using dentry_kill() we use lock_parent() (introduced in the
previous commit) to get that lock in a safe way, recheck ->d_count
(in case if lock_parent() has ended up dropping and retaking ->d_lock
and somebody managed to grab a reference during that window), trylock
the inode->i_lock and use __dentry_kill() to do the rest.
