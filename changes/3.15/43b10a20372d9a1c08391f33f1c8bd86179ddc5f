ocfs2: avoid system inode ref confusion by adding mutex lock

The following case may lead to the same system inode ref in confusion.

A thread                            B thread
ocfs2_get_system_file_inode
->get_local_system_inode
->_ocfs2_get_system_file_inode
                                    because of *arr == NULL,
                                    ocfs2_get_system_file_inode
                                    ->get_local_system_inode
                                    ->_ocfs2_get_system_file_inode
gets first ref thru
_ocfs2_get_system_file_inode,
gets second ref thru igrab and
set *arr = inode
                                    at the moment, B thread also gets
                                    two refs, so lead to one more
                                    inode ref.

So add mutex lock to avoid multi thread set two inode ref once at the
same time.
