iio: Avoid unnecessary kasprintf

name_format already contains the final name and no format characters. So the
code basically reads:

	dev_attr->attr.name = kstrdup(GFP_KERNEL, name_format);
	if (dev_attr->attr.name == NULL)
		...
	kfree(name_format);

Which means we can save one alloc and free pair per attribute name if we
directly assign name_format to dev_attr->attr.name.

The patch also renames name_format to name to denote that this is indeed the
final name and has no format characters in it.
