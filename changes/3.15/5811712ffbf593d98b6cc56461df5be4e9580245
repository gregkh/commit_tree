tty: serial: bcm63xx_uart: define UART_REG_SIZE constant

The bcm63xx_uart driver uses RSET_UART_SIZE which is a constant defined
for MIPS-based BCM63xx platforms, pull this constant value from the
MIPS-specific header and put it in include/linux/serial_bcm63xx.h to
make the driver platform agnostic.
