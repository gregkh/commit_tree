net: mvmdio: Check for a valid interrupt instead of an error

    of/irq: do irq resolution in platform_get_irq

changed platform_get_irq() which now returns EINVAL and EPROBE_DEFER,
in addition to ENXIO. If there's no interrupt for mvmdio, platform_get_irq()
returns EINVAL, but we currently check only for ENXIO.

Fix this by looking for a positive integer, which is the proper way of
validating a virtual interrupt number.

While at it, add a proper handling for the deferral probe case.
