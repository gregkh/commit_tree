gpio / ACPI: Allocate ACPI specific data directly in acpi_gpiochip_add()

We are going to add more ACPI specific data to accompany GPIO chip so
instead of allocating it per each use-case we allocate it once when
acpi_gpiochip_add() is called and release it when acpi_gpiochip_remove() is
called.

Doing this allows us to add more ACPI specific data by merely adding new
fields to struct acpi_gpio_chip.

In addition we embed evt_pins member directly to the structure instead of
having it as a pointer. This simplifies the code a bit since we don't need
to check against NULL.
