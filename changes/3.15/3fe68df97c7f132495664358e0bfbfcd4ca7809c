bonding: always set recv_probe to bond_arp_rcv in arp monitor

Currently we only set bond_arp_rcv() if we're using arp_validate, however
this makes us skip updating last_arp_rx if we're not validating incoming
ARPs - thus, if arp_validate is off, last_arp_rx will never be updated.

Fix this by always setting up recv_probe = bond_arp_rcv, even if we're not
using arp_validate.
