ARM: pxa: select I2C_GPIO only if I2C is on

The Arcom/Eurotech VIPER SBC enables the I2C_GPIO driver, but
that has a dependency on I2C, and causes build failures if I2C
is disabled. To keep existing configurations running while fixing
the randconfig problems, this changes the logic to only enable
I2C_GPIO if I2C is already enabled.
