Btrfs: avoid warning bomb of btrfs_invalidate_inodes

So after transaction is aborted, we need to cleanup inode resources by
calling btrfs_invalidate_inodes(), and btrfs_invalidate_inodes() hopes
roots' refs to be zero in old times and sets a WARN_ON(), however, this
is not always true within cleaning up transaction, so we get to detect
transaction abortion and not warn at all.
