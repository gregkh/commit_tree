[media] v4l: Rename vb2_queue.timestamp_type as timestamp_flags

The timestamp_type field used to contain only the timestamp type. Soon it
will be used for timestamp source flags as well. Rename the field
accordingly.

[m.chehab@samsung.com: do the change also to drivers/staging/media and at s2255]
