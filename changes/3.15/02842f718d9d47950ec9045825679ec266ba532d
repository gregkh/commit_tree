tipc: rename stack variables in function tipc_link_tunnel_rcv

After the previous redesign of the tunnel reception algorithm and
functions, we finalize it by renaming a couple of stack variables
in tipc_tunnel_rcv(). This makes it more consistent with the naming
scheme elsewhere in this part of the code.

This change is purely cosmetic, with no functional changes.
