tick: Introduce hrtimer based broadcast

On some architectures, in certain CPU deep idle states the local timers stop.
An external clock device is used to wakeup these CPUs. The kernel support for the
wakeup of these CPUs is provided by the tick broadcast framework by using the
external clock device as the wakeup source.

However not all implementations of architectures provide such an external
clock device. This patch includes support in the broadcast framework to handle
the wakeup of the CPUs in deep idle states on such systems by queuing a hrtimer
on one of the CPUs, which is meant to handle the wakeup of CPUs in deep idle states.

This patchset introduces a pseudo clock device which can be registered by the
archs as tick_broadcast_device in the absence of a real external clock
device. Once registered, the broadcast framework will work as is for these
architectures as long as the archs take care of the BROADCAST_ENTER
notification failing for one of the CPUs. This CPU is made the stand by CPU to
handle wakeup of the CPUs in deep idle and it *must not enter deep idle states*.

The CPU with the earliest wakeup is chosen to be this CPU. Hence this way the
stand by CPU dynamically moves around and so does the hrtimer which is queued
to trigger at the next earliest wakeup time. This is consistent with the case where
an external clock device is present. The smp affinity of this clock device is
set to the CPU with the earliest wakeup. This patchset handles the hotplug of
the stand by CPU as well by moving the hrtimer on to the CPU handling the CPU_DEAD
notification.
