locks: skip deadlock detection on FL_FILE_PVT locks

It's not really feasible to do deadlock detection with FL_FILE_PVT
locks since they aren't owned by a single task, per-se. Deadlock
detection also tends to be rather expensive so just skip it for
these sorts of locks.

Also, add a FIXME comment about adding more limited deadlock detection
that just applies to ro -> rw upgrades, per Andy's request.
