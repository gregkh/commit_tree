ALSA: hda/realtek - Correction of fixup codes for PB V7900 laptop

Correcion of wrong fixup entries add in commit ca8f0424 to replace
static model quirk for PB V7900 laptop (will model).

[note: the removal of ALC260_FIXUP_HP_PIN_0F chain is also needed as a
 part of the fix; otherwise the pin is set up wrongly as a headphone,
 and user-space (PulseAudio) may be wrongly trying to detect the jack
 state -- tiwai]
