ASoC: Move active count from CODEC to component

There is no reason why active count tracking should only be done for CODECs but
not for other components. Moving the active count from the snd_soc_codec struct
to the snd_soc_component struct reduces the differences between CODECs and other
components and will eventually allow component to component DAI links (Which is
a prerequisite for converting CODECs to components).
