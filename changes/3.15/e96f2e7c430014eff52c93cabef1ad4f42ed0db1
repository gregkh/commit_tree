ip_tunnel: Set network header properly for IP_ECN_decapsulate()

In ip_tunnel_rcv(), set skb->network_header to inner IP header
before IP_ECN_decapsulate().

Without the fix, IP_ECN_decapsulate() takes outer IP header as
inner IP header, possibly causing error messages or packet drops.

Note that this skb_reset_network_header() call was in this spot when
the original feature for checking consistency of ECN bits through
tunnels was added in eccc1bb8d4b4 ("tunnel: drop packet if ECN present
with not-ECT"). It was only removed from this spot in 3d7b46cd20e3
("ip_tunnel: push generic protocol handling to ip_tunnel module.").

Fixes: 3d7b46cd20e3 ("ip_tunnel: push generic protocol handling to ip_tunnel module.")
