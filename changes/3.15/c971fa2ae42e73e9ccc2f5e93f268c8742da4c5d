can: Unify MTU settings for CAN interfaces

CAN interfaces only support MTU values of 16 (CAN 2.0) and 72 (CAN FD).
Setting the MTU to other values is pointless but it does not really hurt.
With the introduction of the CAN FD support in drivers/net/can a new
function to switch the MTU for CAN FD has been introduced.

This patch makes use of this can_change_mtu() function to check for correct
MTU settings also in legacy CAN (2.0) devices.
