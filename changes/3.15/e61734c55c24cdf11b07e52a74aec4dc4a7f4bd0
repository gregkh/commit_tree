cgroup: remove cgroup->name

cgroup->name handling became quite complicated over time involving
dedicated struct cgroup_name for RCU protection.  Now that cgroup is
on kernfs, we can drop all of it and simply use kernfs_name/path() and
friends.  Replace cgroup->name and all related code with kernfs
name/path constructs.

* Reimplement cgroup_name() and cgroup_path() as thin wrappers on top
  of kernfs counterparts, which involves semantic changes.
  pr_cont_cgroup_name() and pr_cont_cgroup_path() added.

* cgroup->name handling dropped from cgroup_rename().

* All users of cgroup_name/path() updated to the new semantics.  Users
  which were formatting the string just to printk them are converted
  to use pr_cont_cgroup_name/path() instead, which simplifies things
  quite a bit.  As cgroup_name() no longer requires RCU read lock
  around it, RCU lockings which were protecting only cgroup_name() are
  removed.

v2: Comment above oom_info_lock updated as suggested by Michal.

v3: dummy_top doesn't have a kn associated and
    pr_cont_cgroup_name/path() ended up calling the matching kernfs
    functions with NULL kn leading to oops.  Test for NULL kn and
    print "/" if so.  This issue was reported by Fengguang Wu.

v4: Rebased on top of 0ab02ca8f887 ("cgroup: protect modifications to
    cgroup_idr with cgroup_mutex").
