can: c_can: Remove tx locking

Mark suggested to use one IF for the softirq and the other for the
xmit function to avoid the xmit lock.

That requires to write the frame into the interface first, then handle
the echo skb and store the dlc before committing the TX request to the
message ram.

We use an atomic to handle the active buffers instead of reading the
MSGVAL register as thats way faster especially on PCH/x86.
