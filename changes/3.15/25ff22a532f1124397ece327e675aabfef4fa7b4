ARM: sunxi: dt: Add sunxi-common-regulators include file

Most sunxi boards with a sata connector also have a gpio controlled connector
for sata target power and almost all sunxi boards have a gpio controlled vbus
for usb1 and usb2.

This commit adds an include file for the regulators representing these
supplies, avoiding the need to copy and paste the regulator code to allmost
all sunxi board dts files.
