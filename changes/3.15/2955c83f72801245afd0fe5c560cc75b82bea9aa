KVM: s390: Optimize ucontrol path

Since commit 7c470539c95630c1f2a10f109e96f249730b75eb
(s390/kvm: avoid automatic sie reentry) we will run through the C code
of KVM on host interrupts instead of just reentering the guest. This
will result in additional ucontrol exits (at least HZ per second). Let
handle a 0 intercept in the kernel and dont return to userspace,
even if in ucontrol mode.
