can: peak_pci: prevent use after free at netdev removal

As remarked by Christopher R. Baker in his post at

http://marc.info/?l=linux-can&m=139707295706465&w=2

there's a possibility for an use after free condition at device removal.

This simplified patch introduces an additional variable to prevent the issue.
Thanks for catching this.
