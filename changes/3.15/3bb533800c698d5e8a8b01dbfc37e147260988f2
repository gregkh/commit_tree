tipc: change signature of tunnelling reception function

After the earlier commits in this series related to the function
tipc_link_tunnel_rcv(), we can now go further and simplify its
signature.

The function now consumes all DUPLICATE packets, and only returns such
ORIGINAL packets that are ready for immediate delivery, i.e., no
more link level protocol processing needs to be done by the caller.
As a consequence, the the caller, tipc_rcv(), does not access the link
pointer after call return, and it becomes unnecessary to pass a link
pointer reference in the call. Instead, we now only pass it the tunnel
link's owner node, which is sufficient to find the destination link for
the tunnelled packet.
