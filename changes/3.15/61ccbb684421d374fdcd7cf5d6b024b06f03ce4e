ether: add loopback type ETH_P_LOOPBACK

Per IEEE 802.3*, the correct packet type for loopback 0x9000. There's
already one ETH_P_LOOP 0x0060, which has been there for ages, however it's
plainly wrong as anything that small is considered a length field.

We can't remove it because legacy, so add a new type which corresponds to
the correct id.
