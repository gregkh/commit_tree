ARM: mvebu: make use of of_find_matching_node_and_match

Instead of the of_find_matching_node()/of_match_node() pair, which requires two
iterations through the match table, make use of of_find_matching_node_and_match(),
which only iterates through the table once.

While we're here, mark the of_system_controller table const.
