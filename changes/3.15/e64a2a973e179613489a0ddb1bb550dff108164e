PCI: rcar: Fix bridge logic configuration accesses

The bridge logic at slot 0 only supports reads up to 0x40 and the rest of
the PCI configuration space for this slot is marked as reserved in the
manual.

Trying a read from offset 0x100 is producing an error from the bridge. With
error interrupts enabled, the following is printed:

  pci-rcar-gen2 ee0d0000.pci: error irq: status 00000014
