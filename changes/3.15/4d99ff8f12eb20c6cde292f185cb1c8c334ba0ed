fuse: Turn writeback cache on

Introduce a bit kernel and userspace exchange between each-other on
the init stage and turn writeback on if the userspace want this and
mount option 'allow_wbcache' is present (controlled by fusermount).

Also add each writable file into per-inode write list and call the
generic_file_aio_write to make use of the Linux page cache engine.
