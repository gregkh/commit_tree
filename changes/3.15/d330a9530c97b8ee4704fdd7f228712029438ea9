drm/i915: move module parameters into a struct, in a new file

With 20+ module parameters, I think referring to them via a struct
improves clarity over just having a bunch of globals. While at it, move
the parameter initialization and definitions into a new file
i915_params.c to reduce clutter in i915_drv.c.

Apart from the ill-named i915_enable_rc6, i915_enable_fbc and
i915_enable_ppgtt parameters, for which we lose the "i915_" prefix
internally, the module parameters now look the same both on the kernel
command line and in code. For example, "i915.modeset".

The downsides of the change are losing static on a couple of variables
and not having the initialization and module_param_named() right next to
each other. On the other hand, all module parameters are now defined in
one place at i915_params.c. Plus you can do this to find all module
parameter references:

$ git grep "i915\." -- drivers/gpu/drm/i915

v2:
- move the definitions into a new file
- s/i915_params/i915/
- make i915_try_reset i915.reset, for consistency
