x86, boot: Undef memcmp before providing a new definition

With CONFIG_X86_32=y, string_32.h gets pulled in compressed/string.c by
"misch.h". string_32.h defines a macro to map memcmp to __builtin_memcmp().
And that macro in turn changes the name of memcmp() defined here and
converts it to __builtin_memcmp().

I thought that's not the intention though. We probably want to provide
our own optimized definition of memcmp(). If yes, then undef the memcmp
before we define a new memcmp.
