crypto: dcp - Move the AES operation type from actx to rctx

Move the AES operation type and mode from async crypto context to
crypto request context. This allows for recycling of the async crypto
context for different kinds of operations.

I found this problem when I used dm-crypt, which uses the same async
crypto context (actx) for both encryption and decryption requests.
Since the requests are enqueued into the processing queue, immediatelly
storing the type of operation into async crypto context (actx) caused
corruption of this information when encryption and decryption operations
followed imediatelly one after the other. When the first operation was
dequeued, the second operation was already enqueued and overwritten the
type of operation in actx, thus causing incorrect result of the first
operation.

Fix this problem by storing the type of operation into the crypto request
context.
