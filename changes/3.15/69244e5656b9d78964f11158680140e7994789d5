ath10k: add vdev-id, return code to error codes

When using multiple vdevs (stations, aps, etc), it is
nice to be able to associate log messages with specific
interfaces.  So, add vdev-id to most logging messages.
Add return code as well, where it was missing.

kvalo: unify some of the messages to follow the same style
