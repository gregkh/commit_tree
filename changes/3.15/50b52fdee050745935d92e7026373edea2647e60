PCI: pciehp: Add hotplug_lock to serialize hotplug events

Today it is there is no protection around pciehp_enable_slot() and
pciehp_disable_slot() to ensure that they complete before another
hot-plug operation can be done on that particular slot.

This patch introduces the slot->hotplug_lock to ensure that any hotplug
operations (add / remove) complete before another hotplug event can begin
processing on that particular slot.
