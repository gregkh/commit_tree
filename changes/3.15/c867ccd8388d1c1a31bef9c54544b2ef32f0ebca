ftrace: Inline the code from ftrace_dyn_table_alloc()

The function used to do allocations some time ago. This no longer
happens and it only checks the count and prints some info. This patch
inlines the body to the only caller. There are two reasons:
* the name of the function was misleading
* it's clear what is going on in ftrace_init now
