cgroup: clean up cgroup_subsys names and initialization

cgroup_subsys is a bit messier than it needs to be.

* The name of a subsys can be different from its internal identifier
  defined in cgroup_subsys.h.  Most subsystems use the matching name
  but three - cpu, memory and perf_event - use different ones.

* cgroup_subsys_id enums are postfixed with _subsys_id and each
  cgroup_subsys is postfixed with _subsys.  cgroup.h is widely
  included throughout various subsystems, it doesn't and shouldn't
  have claim on such generic names which don't have any qualifier
  indicating that they belong to cgroup.

* cgroup_subsys->subsys_id should always equal the matching
  cgroup_subsys_id enum; however, we require each controller to
  initialize it and then BUG if they don't match, which is a bit
  silly.

This patch cleans up cgroup_subsys names and initialization by doing
the followings.

* cgroup_subsys_id enums are now postfixed with _cgrp_id, and each
  cgroup_subsys with _cgrp_subsys.

* With the above, renaming subsys identifiers to match the userland
  visible names doesn't cause any naming conflicts.  All non-matching
  identifiers are renamed to match the official names.

  cpu_cgroup -> cpu
  mem_cgroup -> memory
  perf -> perf_event

* controllers no longer need to initialize ->subsys_id and ->name.
  They're generated in cgroup core and set automatically during boot.

* Redundant cgroup_subsys declarations removed.

* While updating BUG_ON()s in cgroup_init_early(), convert them to
  WARN()s.  BUGging that early during boot is stupid - the kernel
  can't print anything, even through serial console and the trap
  handler doesn't even link stack frame properly for back-tracing.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.

v2: Rebased on top of fe1217c4f3f7 ("net: net_cls: move cgroupfs
    classid handling into core").
