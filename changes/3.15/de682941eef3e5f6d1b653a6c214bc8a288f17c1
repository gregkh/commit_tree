bnx2x: Fix UNDI driver unload

Commit 91ebb928b "bnx2x: Add support for Multi-Function UNDI" contains a bug
which prevent the emptying of the device's Rx buffers before reset.
As a result, on new boards it is likely HW will reach some fatal assertion
once its interfaces load after UNDI was previously loaded.
