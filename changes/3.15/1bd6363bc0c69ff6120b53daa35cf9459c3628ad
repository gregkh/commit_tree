spi: sh-msiof: Use core message handling instead of spi-bitbang

The only remaining feature of spi-bitbang used by this driver is the
chipselect() callback, which just does conditional GPIO.
This is handled fine by the SPI core's spi_set_cs(), hence switch the
driver to use the core message handling through our own transfer_one()
method.

As the (optional) GPIO CS is no longer deasserted at spi_master.setup()
time (through spi_bitbang_setup() and the spi_bitbang.chipselect()
callback), we now have to take care of that ourselves.

Remove the call to spi_master_put() in sh_msiof_spi_remove(), as our SPI
master is now registered using devm_spi_register_master()
(spi_bitbang_start() uses the non-managed version).
