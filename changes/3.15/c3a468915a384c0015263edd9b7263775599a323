btrfs: Add trace for btrfs_workqueue alloc/destroy

Since most of the btrfs_workqueue is printed as pointer address,
for easier analysis, add trace for btrfs_workqueue alloc/destroy.
So it is possible to determine the workqueue that a given work belongs
to(by comparing the wq pointer address with alloc trace event).
