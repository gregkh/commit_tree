net: cdc_ncm: respect operator preferred MTU reported by MBIM

According to "Universal Serial Bus Communications Class Subclass
Specification for Mobile Broadband Interface Model, Revision 1.0,
Errata-1" published by USB-IF, the wMTU field of the MBIM extended
functional descriptor indicates the operator preferred MTU for IP data
streams.

This patch modifies cdc_ncm_setup to ensure that the MTU value set on
the usbnet device does not exceed the operator preferred MTU indicated
by wMTU if the MBIM device exposes a MBIM extended functional
descriptor.
