powercap / intel_rapl: relax sanity check on energy counters

Some RAPL domains may not be active at the time driver is being
loaded. Checking energy counter increment may be too strict and
time consuming. So relax the sanity check on energy counters of
these domains.

Otherwise, they may be ignored and become unavailable to the
powercap framework.
