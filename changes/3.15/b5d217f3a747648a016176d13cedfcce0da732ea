ixgbevf: fix handling of tx checksumming

This patch resolves an issue introduced by:
commit 7ad1a093519e37fb673579819bf6af122641c397
ixgbevf: make the first tx_buffer a repository for most of the skb info

Incorrect check for the result of ixgbevf_tso() can lead to calling
ixgbevf_tx_csum() which can spawn 2 context descriptors and result in
performance degradation and/or corrupted packets.
