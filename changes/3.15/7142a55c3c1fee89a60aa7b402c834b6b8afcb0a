e1000e: Fix issue with link flap on 82579

Several customers have reported a link flap issue on 82579. The symptoms
are random and intermittent link losses when 82579 is connected to specific
link partners. Issue has been root caused as interoperability problem
between 82579 and at least some Broadcom PHYs in the Energy Efficient
Ethernet wake mechanism.

To fix the issue, we are disabling the Phase Locked Loop shutdown in 100M
Low Power Idle.  This solution will cause an increase of power in 100M EEE
link. It will cost additional 28mW in this specific mode.
