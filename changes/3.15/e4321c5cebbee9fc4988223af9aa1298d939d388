HID: Kconfig updates for the Sony module

Update the HID_SONY config with 'select POWER_SUPPLY' to fix build issues
relating to undefined references to the  power_supply_* functions in
certain build configurations.

Update the description text to reflect that Playstation 4 controllers are now
supported.

[jkosina@suse.cz: drop the POWER_SUPPLY hunk, as I've already fixed that]
