driver/memory:Move Freescale IFC driver to a common driver

 Freescale IFC controller has been used for mpc8xxx. It will be used
 for ARM-based SoC as well. This patch moves the driver to driver/memory
 and fix the header file includes.

  Also remove module_platform_driver() and  instead call
  platform_driver_register() from subsys_initcall() to make sure this module
  has been loaded before MTD partition parsing starts.
