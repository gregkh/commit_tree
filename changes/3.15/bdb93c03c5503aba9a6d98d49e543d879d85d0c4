gpio: bcm281xx: Centralize register locking

Rather than unlock/re-lock for every write access, unlock a GPIO when
it is requested and re-lock it when it is freed. As a result, the GPIO
helper functions no longer have to deal with unlocking and re-locking
the register.

In addition, only unlock a specific GPIO rather than unlocking the
entire GPIO bank as before.
