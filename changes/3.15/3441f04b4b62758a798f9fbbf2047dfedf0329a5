powerpc/powernv: Create OPAL sglist helper functions and fix endian issues

We have two copies of code that creates an OPAL sg list. Consolidate
these into a common set of helpers and fix the endian issues.

The flash interface embedded a version number in the num_entries
field, whereas the dump interface did did not. Since versioning
wasn't added to the flash interface and it is impossible to add
this in a backwards compatible way, just remove it.
