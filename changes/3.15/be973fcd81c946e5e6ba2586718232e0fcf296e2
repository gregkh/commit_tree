staging: vt6656: fix indentation in if statement

Dave Jones pointed out that commit
302433daf47aeb7d21d66e55fb84d6a8fffd4aed (staging: vt6656: device.h
Remove typedef enum __device_init_type.), improperly indented a line to
make it look like it was under the if line above it, but it wasn't.

So fix this up.
