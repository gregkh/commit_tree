ipv6: gro: fix CHECKSUM_COMPLETE support

When GRE support was added in linux-3.14, CHECKSUM_COMPLETE handling
broke on GRE+IPv6 because we did not update/use the appropriate csum :

GRO layer is supposed to use/update NAPI_GRO_CB(skb)->csum instead of
skb->csum

Tested using a GRE tunnel and IPv6 traffic. GRO aggregation now happens
at the first level (ethernet device) instead of being done in gre
tunnel. Native IPv6+TCP is still properly aggregated.
