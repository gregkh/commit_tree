pinctrl: tegra: add some missing Tegra114 entries

Add some missing pin and drive group definitions to the driver. These
are all defined in the TRM, but missing from the driver for some reason.

Fix a couple of mistakes in the drive group definitions.

Much of the diff to tegra114_groups[] is an indentation change due to one
of the new group names being long. git diff/show -w will highlight this.
