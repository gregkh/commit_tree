xhci: Set SCT field for Set TR dequeue on streams

Nec XHCI controllers don't seem to care, but without this Intel XHCI
controllers reject Set TR dequeue commands with a COMP_TRB_ERR, leading
to the following warning:

WARN Set TR Deq Ptr cmd invalid because of stream ID configuration

And very shortly after this the system completely freezes.
