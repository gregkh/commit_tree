bus: mvebu-mbus: allow several windows with the same target/attribute

Having multiple windows with the same target and attribute is actually
legal, and can be useful for PCIe windows, when PCIe BARs have a size
that isn't a power of two, and we therefore need to create several
MBus windows to cover the PCIe BAR for a given PCIe interface.
