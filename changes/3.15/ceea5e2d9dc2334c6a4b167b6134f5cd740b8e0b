[media] drx-j: use the proper timeout code on scu_command

Checking if a time is after another one can have issues, as
times are generally u32 wide.

Use the proper macros for that at scu_command().

It should be noticed that other places also use jiffies
calculus on an improper way. This should be fixed too,
but the logic there is more complex. So, let's do it in
separate patches.
