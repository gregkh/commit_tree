can: c_can: Make it SMP safe

The hardware has two message control interfaces, but the code only uses the
first one. So on SMP the following can be observed:

CPU0 	       	CPU1
rx_poll()
  write IF1	xmit()
		write IF1
  write IF1

That results in corrupted message object configurations. The TX/RX is not
globally serialized it's only serialized on a core.

Simple solution: Let RX use IF1 and TX use IF2 and all is good.
