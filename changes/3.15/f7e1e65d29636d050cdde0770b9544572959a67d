s390: improve debug feature usage

The maximum usable buffer size of the s390 debug feature (when using
the sprintf_view) is 11 * sizeof(long) (1 pointer for the format
string + 10 arguments). When a larger buffer size is specified the
additional memory is unused and wasted per debug entry. So reducing
the buffer size to its maximum (or to the actual buffer size used)
will make more precious debug feature space usable.

For pci_msg, chsc_msg, and cio_crw we use the additional usable dbf
space to reduce the number of allocated pages.
