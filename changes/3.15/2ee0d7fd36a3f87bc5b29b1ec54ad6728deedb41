ARM64: perf: add support for perf registers API

This patch implements the functions required for the perf registers API,
allowing the perf tool to interface kernel register dumps with libunwind
in order to provide userspace backtracing.
Compat mode is also supported.

Only the general purpose user space registers are exported, i.e.:
 PERF_REG_ARM_X0,
 ...
 PERF_REG_ARM_X28,
 PERF_REG_ARM_FP,
 PERF_REG_ARM_LR,
 PERF_REG_ARM_SP,
 PERF_REG_ARM_PC
and not the PERF_REG_ARM_V* registers.
