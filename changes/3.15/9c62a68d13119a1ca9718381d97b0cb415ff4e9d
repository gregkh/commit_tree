netpoll: Remove dead packet receive code (CONFIG_NETPOLL_TRAP)

The netpoll packet receive code only becomes active if the netpoll
rx_skb_hook is implemented, and there is not a single implementation
of the netpoll rx_skb_hook in the kernel.

All of the out of tree implementations I have found all call
netpoll_poll which was removed from the kernel in 2011, so this
change should not add any additional breakage.

There are problems with the netpoll packet receive code.  __netpoll_rx
does not call dev_kfree_skb_irq or dev_kfree_skb_any in hard irq
context.  netpoll_neigh_reply leaks every skb it receives.  Reception
of packets does not work successfully on stacked devices (aka bonding,
team, bridge, and vlans).

Given that the netpoll packet receive code is buggy, there are no
out of tree users that will be merged soon, and the code has
not been used for in tree for a decade let's just remove it.

Reverting this commit can server as a starting point for anyone
who wants to resurrect netpoll packet reception support.
