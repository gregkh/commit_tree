ethtool: Document the general convention for VLAs in kernel space

Various ethtool command structures are declared with zero-length array
at the end which are intended to be variable-length in userland
(relying on lack of compiler bounds checking).  However, in the kernel
the structure and array are always allocated and passed to driver
operations separately.  Make that explicit.
