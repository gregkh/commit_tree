raid5: fix a race of stripe count check

I hit another BUG_ON with e240c1839d11152b0355442. In __get_priority_stripe(),
stripe count equals to 0 initially. Between atomic_inc and BUG_ON,
get_active_stripe() finds the stripe. So the stripe count isn't 1 any more.

V2: keeps the BUG_ON suggested by Neil.
