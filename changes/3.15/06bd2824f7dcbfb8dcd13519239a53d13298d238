xtensa: handle memmap kernel option

This option is useful for reserving memory regions for secondary cores
in AMP configurations.

Implement the following memmap variants:
- memmap=nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]: force usage of a specific region of memory;
- memmap=nn[KMG]$ss[KMG]: mark specified memory as reserved;
- memmap=nn[KMG]: set end of memory.
