arm64: KVM: flush VM pages before letting the guest enable caches

When the guest runs with caches disabled (like in an early boot
sequence, for example), all the writes are diectly going to RAM,
bypassing the caches altogether.

Once the MMU and caches are enabled, whatever sits in the cache
becomes suddenly visible, which isn't what the guest expects.

A way to avoid this potential disaster is to invalidate the cache
when the MMU is being turned on. For this, we hook into the SCTLR_EL1
trapping code, and scan the stage-2 page tables, invalidating the
pages/sections that have already been mapped in.
