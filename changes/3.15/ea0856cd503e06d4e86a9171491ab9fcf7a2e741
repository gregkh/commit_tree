fs/reiserfs: move prototype declaration to header file

Move prototype declaration to header file reiserfs/reiserfs.h from
reiserfs/super.c because they are used by more than one file.

This eliminates the following warning in reiserfs/bitmap.c:

  fs/reiserfs/bitmap.c:647:6: warning: no previous prototype for `show_alloc_options' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
