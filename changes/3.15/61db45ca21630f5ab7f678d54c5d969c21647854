  Subject: ACPICA: Add mechanism for early object repairs on a per-name basis

  Adds the framework to allow object repairs very early in the
  return object analysis. Enables repairs like string->unicode,
  etc.

This patch restores the implementation of the NULL element repair code for
ACPI_RTYPE_NONE.  In the original design, ACPI_RTYPE_NONE is defined to
collect simple NULL object repairs.
