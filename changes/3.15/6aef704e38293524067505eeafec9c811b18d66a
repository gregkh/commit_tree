HID: multitouch: add support of other generic collections in hid-mt

The ANTON Touch Pad is a device which can switch from a multitouch
touchpad to a mouse. It thus presents several generic collections which
are currently ignored by hid-multitouch. Enable them by not ignoring
them in mt_input_mapping.
Adding also a suffix for them depending on their application.
