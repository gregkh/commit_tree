ARM: OMAP3: fix iva mmu programming issues

The IVA MMU is not functional when used through the hwmod and
omap_device layers. Add fixes to clockdomain and hwmod data
to have it functional. The hwmod changes are needed to enable
the clock, and the SWSUP change is needed to wakeup the domain
because the power domain is programmed to be in RET, and there
is no automatic power domain switching to ON.
