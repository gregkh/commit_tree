ext4: avoid exposure of stale data in ext4_punch_hole()

While handling punch-hole fallocate, it's useless to truncate page cache
before removing the range from extent tree (or block map in indirect case)
because page cache can be re-populated (by read-ahead or read(2) or mmap-ed
read) immediately after truncating page cache, but before updating extent
tree (or block map). In that case the user will see stale data even after
fallocate is completed.

Until the problem of data corruption resulting from pages backed by
already freed blocks is fully resolved, the simple thing we can do now
is to add another truncation of pagecache after punch hole is done.
