cfg80211: Pass TDLS peer capability information in tdls_mgmt

While framing the TDLS Setup Confirmation frame, the driver needs to
know if the TDLS peer is VHT/HT/WMM capable and thus shall construct
the VHT/HT operation / WMM parameter elements accordingly. Supplicant
determines if the TDLS peer is VHT/HT/WMM capable based on the
presence of the respective IEs in the received TDLS Setup Response frame.

The host driver should not need to parse the received TDLS Response
frame and thus, should be able to rely on the supplicant to indicate
the capability of the peer through additional flags while transmitting
the TDLS Setup Confirmation frame through tdls_mgmt operations.
