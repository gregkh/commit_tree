ASoC: Intel: Fix audio crash due to race condition in stream deletion

There is a race between sst_byt_stream_free() and sst_byt_get_stream()
if sst_byt_get_stream() called from sst_byt_irq_thread() context is
accessing the byt->stream_list while a stream is deleted from the list.

A stream is added to byt->stream_list in sst_byt_stream_new() and deleted in
sst_byt_stream_free(). sst_byt_get_stream() is always protected by
sst->spinlock, but the stream addition and deletion are not protected.

The patch adds spinlock to both stream addition and deletion.

[Jarkko: Same fix added to sst-haswell-ipc.c too]
