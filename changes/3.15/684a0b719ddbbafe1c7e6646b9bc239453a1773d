KVM: eventfd: Fix lock order inversion.

When registering a new irqfd, we call its ->poll method to collect any
event that might have previously been pending so that we can trigger it.
This is done under the kvm->irqfds.lock, which means the eventfd's ctx
lock is taken under it.

However, if we get a POLLHUP in irqfd_wakeup, we will be called with the
ctx lock held before getting the irqfds.lock to deactivate the irqfd,
causing lockdep to complain.

Calling the ->poll method does not really need the irqfds.lock, so let's
just move it after we've given up the irqfds.lock in kvm_irqfd_assign().
