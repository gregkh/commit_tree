staging:rtl8187se: Change argument type in function to bool

Since the argument morefrag is being used as a booleon in the function
rtl8180_tx, the type for the argument is changed to booleon in the
function definition and declaration. This ensures that the variable
morefrag is always in the range 0-1 and overflow dooes not cause errors
if it is assigned a value. Also, this improves code readability.
