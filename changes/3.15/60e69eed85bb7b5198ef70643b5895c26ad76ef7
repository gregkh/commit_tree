sched/numa: Fix task_numa_free() lockdep splat

Sasha reported that lockdep claims that the following commit:
made numa_group.lock interrupt unsafe:

  156654f491dd ("sched/numa: Move task_numa_free() to __put_task_struct()")

While I don't see how that could be, given the commit in question moved
task_numa_free() from one irq enabled region to another, the below does
make both gripes and lockups upon gripe with numa=fake=4 go away.
