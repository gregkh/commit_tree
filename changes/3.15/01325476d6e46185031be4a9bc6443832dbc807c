Drivers: hv: Implement the file copy service

Implement the file copy service for Linux guests on Hyper-V. This permits the
host to copy a file (over VMBUS) into the guest. This facility is part of
"guest integration services" supported on the Windows platform.
Here is a link that provides additional details on this functionality:

In V1 version of the patch I have addressed comments from
Olaf Hering <olaf@aepfle.de> and Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>

In V2 version of this patch I did some minor cleanup (making some globals
static). In V4 version of the patch I have addressed all of Olaf's
most recent set of comments/concerns.

In V5 version of the patch I had addressed Greg's most recent comments.
I would like to thank Greg for suggesting that I use misc device; it has
significantly simplified the code.

In V6 version of the patch I have cleaned up error message based on Olaf's
comments. I have also rebased the patch based on the current tip.

In this version of the patch, I have addressed the latest comments from Greg.
