staging/usbip: remove vhci_hcd vhci_hub_status change message

When vhci_hcd is enabled, the following message floods the dmesg buffer.
This message doesn't provide any useful information other than cluttering
the dmesg buffer. Fix it by removing the message. There is another debug
message in this routine that dumps detailed port status change information.
