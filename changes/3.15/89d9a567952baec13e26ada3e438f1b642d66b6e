[SCSI] add support for per-host cmd pools

This allows drivers to specify the size of their per-command private
data in the host template and then get extra memory allocated for
each command instead of needing another allocation in ->queuecommand.

With the current SCSI code that already does multiple allocations for
each command this probably doesn't make a big performance impact, but
it allows to clean up the drivers, and prepare them for using the
blk-mq infrastructure where the common allocation will make a difference.
