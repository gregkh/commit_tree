ARM: sun6i: colombus: Enable the I2C controllers

The A31 Colombus board has 3 I2C controllers that should be usable. However,
the first one is not working for some reason on the hardware I have been able
to test it on, while it should really be the same controller. Enable the i2c1
and i2c2 busses, and mark i2c0 as in failure in the DT.
