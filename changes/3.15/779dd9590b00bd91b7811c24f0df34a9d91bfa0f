ARM: add missing system_misc.h include to process.c

arm_pm_restart(), arm_pm_idle() and soft_restart() are all declared in
system_misc.h, but this file is not included in process.c.  Add this
missing include.  Found via sparse:

arch/arm/kernel/process.c:98:6: warning: symbol 'soft_restart' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/arm/kernel/process.c:127:6: warning: symbol 'arm_pm_restart' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/arm/kernel/process.c:134:6: warning: symbol 'arm_pm_idle' was not declared. Should it be static?
