ALSA: Replace with IS_ENABLED()

Replace the lengthy #if defined(XXX) || defined(XXX_MODULE) with the
new IS_ENABLED() macro.

The patch still doesn't cover all ifdefs.  For example, the dependency
on CONFIG_GAMEPORT is still open-coded because this also has an extra
dependency on MODULE.  Similarly, an open-coded ifdef in pcm_oss.c and
some sequencer-related stuff are left untouched.
