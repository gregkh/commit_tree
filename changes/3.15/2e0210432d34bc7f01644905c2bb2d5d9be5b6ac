virtio_ccw: fix vcdev pointer handling issues

The interrupt handler virtio_ccw_int_handler() using the vcdev pointer
is protected by the ccw_device lock. Resetting the pointer within the
ccw_device structure should be done when holding this lock.

Also resetting the vcdev pointer (under the ccw_device lock) prior to
freeing the vcdev pointer memory removes a critical path.
