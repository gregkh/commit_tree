drm: Pull the test on drm_debug in the logging macros

In the logging code, we are currently checking is we need to output in
drm_ut_debug_printk(). This is too late. The problem is that when we write
something like:

    DRM_DEBUG_DRIVER("ELD on [CONNECTOR:%d:%s], [ENCODER:%d:%s]\n",
                     connector->base.id,
                     drm_get_connector_name(connector),
                     connector->encoder->base.id,
                     drm_get_encoder_name(connector->encoder));

We start by evaluating the arguments (so call drm_get_connector_name() and
drm_get_connector_name()) before ending up in drm_ut_debug_printk() which will
then does nothing.

This means we execute a lot of instructions (drm_get_connector_name(), in turn,
calls snprintf() for example) to happily discard them in the normal case,
drm.debug=0.

So, let's put the test on drm_debug earlier, in the macros themselves.
Sprinkle an unlikely() as well for good measure.
