Kconfig: rename HAS_IOPORT to HAS_IOPORT_MAP

If the renamed symbol is defined lib/iomap.c implements ioport_map and
ioport_unmap and currently (nearly) all platforms define the port
accessor functions outb/inb and friend unconditionally.  So
HAS_IOPORT_MAP is the better name for this.

Consequently NO_IOPORT is renamed to NO_IOPORT_MAP.

The motivation for this change is to reintroduce a symbol HAS_IOPORT
that signals if outb/int et al are available.  I will address that at
least one merge window later though to keep surprises to a minimum and
catch new introductions of (HAS|NO)_IOPORT.

The changes in this commit were done using:

	$ git grep -l -E '(NO|HAS)_IOPORT' | xargs perl -p -i -e 's/\b((?:CONFIG_)?(?:NO|HAS)_IOPORT)\b/$1_MAP/'
