x86/efi: earlyprintk=efi,keep fix

earlyprintk=efi,keep will cause kernel hangs while freeing initmem like
below:

  VFS: Mounted root (ext4 filesystem) readonly on device 254:2.
  devtmpfs: mounted
  Freeing unused kernel memory: 880K (ffffffff817d4000 - ffffffff818b0000)

It is caused by efi earlyprintk use __init function which will be freed
later.  Such as early_efi_write is marked as __init, also it will use
early_ioremap which is init function as well.

To fix this issue, I added early initcall early_efi_map_fb which maps
the whole efi fb for later use. OTOH, adding a wrapper function
early_efi_map which calls early_ioremap before ioremap is available.

With this patch applied efi boot ok with earlyprintk=efi,keep console=efi
