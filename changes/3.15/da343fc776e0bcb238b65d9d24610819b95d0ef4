irqchip: armada-370-xp: fix invalid cast of signed value into unsigned variable

The armada_370_xp_alloc_msi() function returns a signed int, which is
negative on error. However, we store the return value into an
irq_hw_number_t, which is unsigned. Therefore, we actually never test
if armada_370_xp_alloc_msi() returns an error or not, which may lead
us to use hwirq numbers of as 0xffffffe4 (when
armada_370_xp_alloc_msi() returns -ENOSPC).

This commit fixes that by storing the return value of
armada_370_xp_alloc_msi() in a signed variable.
