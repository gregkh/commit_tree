Documentation: update /proc/stat "intr" count summary

The sum at the beginning of line "intr" includes also unnumbered
interrupts.  It implies that the sum at the beginning isn't the sum
of the remainder of the line, not even an estimation.

Fixed the documentation to mention that.

This behaviour was added to /proc/stat in commit a2eddfa95919 ("x86:
make /proc/stat account for all interrupts")
