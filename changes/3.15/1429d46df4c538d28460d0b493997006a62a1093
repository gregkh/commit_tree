xen/grant-table: Refactor gnttab_[un]map_refs to avoid m2p_override

The grant mapping API does m2p_override unnecessarily: only gntdev needs it,
for blkback and future netback patches it just cause a lock contention, as
those pages never go to userspace. Therefore this series does the following:
- the bulk of the original function (everything after the mapping hypercall)
  is moved to arch-dependent set/clear_foreign_p2m_mapping
- the "if (xen_feature(XENFEAT_auto_translated_physmap))" branch goes to ARM
- therefore the ARM function could be much smaller, the m2p_override stubs
  could be also removed
- on x86 the set_phys_to_machine calls were moved up to this new funcion
  from m2p_override functions
- and m2p_override functions are only called when there is a kmap_ops param

It also removes a stray space from arch/x86/include/asm/xen/page.h.
