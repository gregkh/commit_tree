ocfs2: avoid blocking in ocfs2_mark_lockres_freeing() in downconvert thread

If we are dropping last inode reference from downconvert thread, we will
end up calling ocfs2_mark_lockres_freeing() which can block if the lock
we are freeing is queued thus creating an A-A deadlock.  Luckily, since
we are the downconvert thread, we can immediately dequeue the lock and
thus avoid waiting in this case.
