cgroup: fix spurious lockdep warning in cgroup_exit()

cgroup_exit() is called in fork and exit path. If it's called in the
failure path during fork, PF_EXITING isn't set, and then lockdep will
complain.

Fix this by removing cgroup_exit() in that failure path. cgroup_fork()
does nothing that needs cleanup.
