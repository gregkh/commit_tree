uas: Clear cmdinfo on command queue-ing

The scsi error handling path re-uses previously queued up (and errored-out)
cmds. If such a re-used cmd had a data-phase then cmdinfo will have
data_in_urb / data_out_urb still set to the free-ed urbs from the errored-out
cmd, and they will get free-ed a second time when the error handling cmd
completes, corrupting the kernel heap.

Clearing cmdinfo on command queue-ing fixes this, and seems like a good idea
in general.
