cpufreq: move call to __find_governor() to cpufreq_init_policy()

We call __find_governor() during the addition of the first CPU of
each policy from __cpufreq_add_dev() to find the last governor used
for this CPU before it was hot-removed.

After that we call cpufreq_parse_governor() in cpufreq_init_policy(),
either with this governor, or with the default governor. Right after
that policy->governor is set to NULL.

While that code is not functionally problematic, the structure of it
is suboptimal, because some of the code required in cpufreq_init_policy()
is being executed by its caller, __cpufreq_add_dev(). So, it would make
more sense to get all of it together in a single place to make code more
readable.

Accordingly, move the code needed for policy initialization to
cpufreq_init_policy() and initialize policy->governor to NULL at the
beginning.

In order to clean up the code a bit more, some of the #ifdefs for
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU are dropped too.
