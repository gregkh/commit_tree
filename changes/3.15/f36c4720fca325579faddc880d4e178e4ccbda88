MIPS: Add support for the M5150 processor

The M5150 core is a 32-bit MIPS RISC which implements the
MIPS Architecture Release-5  in a 5-stage pipeline.
In addition, it includes the MIPS Architecture Virtualization Module
that enables virtualization of operating systems,
which provides a scalable, trusted, and secure execution environment.
