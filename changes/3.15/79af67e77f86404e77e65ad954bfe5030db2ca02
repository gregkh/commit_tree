[media] uvcvideo: Update uvc_endpoint_max_bpi to handle USB_SPEED_WIRELESS devices

Isochronous endpoints on devices with speed == USB_SPEED_WIRELESS can
have a max packet size ranging from 1-3584 bytes.  Add a case to
uvc_endpoint_max_bpi to handle USB_SPEED_WIRELESS.  Otherwise endpoints
for those devices will fall to the default case which masks off any
values > 2047.  This causes uvc_init_video to underestimate the
bandwidth available and fail to find a suitable alt setting for high
bandwidth video streams.
