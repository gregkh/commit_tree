USB: ohci-platform: check for platform data misconfiguration

The ohci-platform driver checks for misconfigurations in cases where
the Device Tree data specifies big-endian registers or descriptors but
the corresponding driver config settings have not been enabled.  As
Jonas Gorski suggested, we may as well apply the same check to general
platform data too.

This requires moving the code that sets the big-endian quirk flags
from the ohci_platform_reset() routine into ohci_platform_probe(), and
moving the checks out of the DT-specific "if" statement clause.

The patch also changes the text of the error messages in an attempt to
make the nature of the error more clear.
