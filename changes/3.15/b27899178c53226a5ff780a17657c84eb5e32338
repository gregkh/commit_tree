ARM: SAMSUNG: Move common save/restore helpers to separate file

To separate legacy PM code from generic helpers, this patch moves the
generic register save/restore helpers to a new file called pm-common.c
that is compiled always when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled, to allow
platforms that do not want to use the legacy PM code use the generic
helpers.
