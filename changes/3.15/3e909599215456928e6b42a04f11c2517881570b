efi: Move facility flags to struct efi

As we grow support for more EFI architectures they're going to want the
ability to query which EFI features are available on the running system.
Instead of storing this information in an architecture-specific place,
stick it in the global 'struct efi', which is already the central
location for EFI state.

While we're at it, let's change the return value of efi_enabled() to be
bool and replace all references to 'facility' with 'feature', which is
the usual word used to describe the attributes of the running system.
