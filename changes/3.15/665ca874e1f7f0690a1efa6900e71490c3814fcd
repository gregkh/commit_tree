ARM: mvebu: Armada 375/38x depend on MULTI_V7

During this release cycle, we're adding the new Armada 375, 380, and 385
SoCs.  We're also migrating DT kirkwood boards into mach-mvebu.  The
kirkwood changes make the different SoCs in mach-mvebu/ depend on
MULTI_V7 or MULTI_V5 as appropriate.

We add this dependency to the new SoCs so that when the branches are
merged, everything is as it should be.
