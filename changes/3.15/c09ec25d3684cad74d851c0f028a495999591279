xhci: Switch Intel Lynx Point ports to EHCI on shutdown.

The same issue like with Panther Point chipsets. If the USB ports are
switched to xHCI on shutdown, the xHCI host will send a spurious interrupt,
which will wake the system. Some BIOS have work around for this, but not all.
One example is Compulab's mini-desktop, the Intense-PC2.

The bug can be avoided if the USB ports are switched back to EHCI on
shutdown.

This patch should be backported to stable kernels as old as 3.12,
that contain the commit 638298dc66ea36623dbc2757a24fc2c4ab41b016
