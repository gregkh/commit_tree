MIPS: KVM: Consult HWREna before emulating RDHWR

The ability to read hardware registers from userland with the RDHWR
instruction should depend upon the corresponding bit of the HWREna
register being set, otherwise a reserved instruction exception should be
generated.

However KVM's current emulation ignores the guest's HWREna and always
emulates RDHWR instructions even if the guest OS has disallowed them.

Therefore rework the RDHWR emulation code to check for privilege or the
corresponding bit in the guest HWREna bit. Also remove the #if 0 case
for the UserLocal register. I presume it was there for debug purposes
but it seems unnecessary now that the guest can control whether it
causes a guest exception.
