xen: Get rid of the last irq_desc abuse

Warn if any PIRQ cannot be bound to an event channel. Remove the check
for irq_desc->action. This hypercall never fails in practice so we can
emit a warning unconditionally.

Remove a check for a valid irq desc. The only caller of
xen_destroy_irq() will only do so if the irq was previously fully
setup, which means the descriptor has been allocated as well.
