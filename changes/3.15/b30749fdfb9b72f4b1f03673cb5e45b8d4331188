can: only send bitrate data via netlink when available

When setting the bitrate both can_calc_bittiming() and can_fixup_bittiming()
lead to the bitrate variable to be set, when a proper bit timing is available.
Only then the bitrate configuration is stored for the device, so checking for
priv->bittiming.bitrate is always sufficient.
