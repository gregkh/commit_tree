drm/i915: remove a column of zeros from the eDP wait definitions

I like how the macros are nicely column-aligned, so we can properly
compare what each macro waits for, but a column full of zeroes doesn't
really help anything: it just makes the lines bigger, and they're
already way past 80 columns. I imagine this column was used in the
past, but IMHO now we can get rid of it.
