iwlwifi: mvm: BT Coex add support for Co-running block

7265 features a new calibration which is called antenna
coupling. The purpose of this calibration (which isn't
really a calibration), is to measure the isolation between
the antennas and that can give us useful information for
the Coex modules.

With this information, we can tune the LookUpTables (LUTs)
that define the BT / WiFi contention policy.

The LUTs currently contain dummy values - but they will be
updated soon.

While at it, change the current code to stop duplicate the
host command while sending. This was needed back then, when
the command was short enough to be allocated on the stack.
Since then, the command grew a lot and is now allocated on
the heap - hence we can use the NOCOPY option instead.
