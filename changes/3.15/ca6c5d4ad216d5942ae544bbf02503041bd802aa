net: ipv4: ip_forward: fix inverted local_df test

local_df means 'ignore DF bit if set', so if its set we're
allowed to perform ip fragmentation.

This wasn't noticed earlier because the output path also drops such skbs
(and emits needed icmp error) and because netfilter ip defrag did not
set local_df until couple of days ago.

Only difference is that DF-packets-larger-than MTU now discarded
earlier (f.e. we avoid pointless netfilter postrouting trip).

While at it, drop the repeated test ip_exceeds_mtu, checking it once
is enough...
