drm/i915: Split context enabling from init

We **need** to do this for exactly 1 reason, because we want to embed a
PPGTT into the context, but we don't want to special case the default
context.

To achieve that, we must be able to initialize contexts after the GTT is
setup (so we can allocate and pin the default context's BO), but before
the PPGTT and rings are initialized. This is because, currently, context
initialization requires ring usage. We don't have rings until after the
GTT is setup. If we split the enabling part of context initialization,
the part requiring the ringbuffer, we can untangle this, and then later
embed the PPGTT

Incidentally this allows us to also adhere to the original design of
context init/fini in future patches: they were only ever meant to be
called at driver load and unload.

v2: Move hw_contexts_disabled test in i915_gem_context_enable() (Chris)

v3: BUG_ON after checking for disabled contexts. Or else it blows up pre
gen6 (Ben)

v4: Forward port
Modified enable for each ring, since that patch is earlier in the series
Dropped ring arg from create_default_context so it can be used by others
