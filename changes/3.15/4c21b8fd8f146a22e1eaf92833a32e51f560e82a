MIPS: seccomp: Handle indirect system calls (o32)

When userland uses syscall() to perform an indirect system call
the actually system call that needs to be checked by the filter
is on the first argument. The kernel code needs to handle this case
by looking at the original syscall number in v0 and if it's
NR_syscall, then it needs to examine the first argument to
identify the real system call that will be executed.
Similarly, we need to 'virtually' shift the syscall() arguments
so the syscall_get_arguments() function can fetch the correct
arguments for the indirect system call.
