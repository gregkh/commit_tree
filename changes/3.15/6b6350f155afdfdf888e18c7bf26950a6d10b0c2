sched: Expose some macros related to priority

Some macros in kernel/sched/sched.h about priority are
private to kernel/sched. But they are useful to other
parts of the core kernel.

This patch moves these macros from kernel/sched/sched.h to
include/linux/sched/prio.h so that they are available to
other subsystems.
