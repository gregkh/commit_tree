mtd: nand: omap: ecc.correct: omap_elm_correct_data: fix programmed-page bit-flip correction logic

This patch updates following checks when bit-flips are detected by ELM:

 - Do not evaluate bit-flips when un-correctable bit-flips is reported by ELM,
   because as per [1] when ELM reports an un-correctable bit-flips,
   'number of error' field in its ELM_LOCATION_STATUS register is also invalid.

 - Return with error-code '-EBADMSG' on detection of un-correctable bit-flip.

 - Return with error-code '-EBADMSG' when bit-flips position is outside current
   Sector and OOB area.

[1] ELM IP spec Table-25 ELM_LOCATION_STATUS Register.
    ELM_LOCATION_STATUS[8] = ECC_CORRECTABLE: Error location process exit status
        0x0: ECC error location process failed.
             Number of errors and error locations are invalid.
        0x1: all errors were successfully located.
             Number of errors and error locations are valid.
