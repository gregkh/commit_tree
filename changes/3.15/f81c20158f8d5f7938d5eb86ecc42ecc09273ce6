ocfs2: fix panic on kfree(xattr->name)

Commit 9548906b2bb7 ('xattr: Constify ->name member of "struct xattr"')
missed that ocfs2 is calling kfree(xattr->name).  As a result, kernel
panic occurs upon calling kfree(xattr->name) because xattr->name refers
static constant names.  This patch removes kfree(xattr->name) from
ocfs2_mknod() and ocfs2_symlink().
