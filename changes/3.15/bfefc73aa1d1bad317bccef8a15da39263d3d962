rcutorture: Stop generic kthreads in torture_cleanup()

The specific torture modules (like rcutorture) need to call
torture_cleanup() in any case, so this commit makes torture_cleanup()
deal with torture_shutdown_cleanup() and torture_stutter_cleanup() so
that the specific modules don't have to deal with these details.
