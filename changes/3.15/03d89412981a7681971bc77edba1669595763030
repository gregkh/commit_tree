perf probe: Use dwarf_getcfi_elf() instead of dwarf_getcfi()

The dwarf_getcfi() only checks .debug_frame section for CFI, but as
most binaries only have .eh_frame it'd return NULL and it makes
some variables inaccessible.

Using dwarf_getcfi_elf (along with dwarf_getelf()) allows to show and
add probe to more variables.
