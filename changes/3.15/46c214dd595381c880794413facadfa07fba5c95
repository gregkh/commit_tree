ARM: KVM: fix handling of trapped 64bit coprocessor accesses

Commit 240e99cbd00a (ARM: KVM: Fix 64-bit coprocessor handling)
changed the way we match the 64bit coprocessor access from
user space, but didn't update the trap handler for the same
set of registers.

The effect is that a trapped 64bit access is never matched, leading
to a fault being injected into the guest. This went unnoticed as we
didn't really trap any 64bit register so far.

Placing the CRm field of the access into the CRn field of the matching
structure fixes the problem. Also update the debug feature to emit the
expected string in case of failing match.
