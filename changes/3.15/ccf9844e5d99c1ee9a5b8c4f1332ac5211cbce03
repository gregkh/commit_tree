kvm, vmx: Really fix lazy FPU on nested guest

Commit e504c9098ed6 (kvm, vmx: Fix lazy FPU on nested guest, 2013-11-13)
highlighted a real problem, but the fix was subtly wrong.

nested_read_cr0 is the CR0 as read by L2, but here we want to look at
the CR0 value reflecting L1's setup.  In other words, L2 might think
that TS=0 (so nested_read_cr0 has the bit clear); but if L1 is actually
running it with TS=1, we should inject the fault into L1.

The effective value of CR0 in L2 is contained in vmcs12->guest_cr0, use
it.
