regulator: arizona-ldo1: Correct default regulator init_data

Both 5102 and 8997 have the regulator capable of supplying 1.8V, and the
voltage step from the 5110 regulator is different from what is specified
in the default description. This patch updates the default regulator
description to match 5110 and selects the 1.8V capable description for
8997.
