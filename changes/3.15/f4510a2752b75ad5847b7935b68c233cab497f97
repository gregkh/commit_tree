drm: Replace crtc fb with primary plane fb (v3)

Now that CRTC's have a primary plane, there's no need to track the
framebuffer in the CRTC.  Replace all references to the CRTC fb with the
primary plane's fb.

This patch was generated by the Coccinelle semantic patching tool using
the following rules:

        @@ struct drm_crtc C; @@
        -   (C).fb
        +   C.primary->fb

        @@ struct drm_crtc *C; @@
        -   (C)->fb
        +   C->primary->fb

v3: Generate patch via coccinelle.  Actual removal of crtc->fb has been
    moved to a subsequent patch.

v2: Fixup several lingering crtc->fb instances that were missed in the
    first patch iteration.  [Rob Clark]
