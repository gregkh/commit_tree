mtd: phram: Repair multiple instances support

Commit b2a2a84d35e0f42ad26e326ec4258f6a8b8eecbe (mtd: phram: dot not crash when
built-in and passing boot param) claims to be "based on Ville Herva's similar
patch to block2mtd" (c4e7fb313771ac03dfdca26d30e8b721731c562b), but it has
missed the crucial point of the original path: all these "if(n)def MODULE".
It has broken the possibility to create several phram instances when phram is
compiled as module. The possibility to add instances via /sys writes to
/sys/module/phram/parameters/phram was also broken with mentioned patch.
Proposed patch takes the idea of original block2mtd patch to its full extent.
Assumption "This function is always called before 'init_phram()'" was also
incorrect, so removed the comment. This patch effectively reverts also
b11ec57fc6e6d4882ef01a0c09a1dde58f50492e (mtd: phram: fix section mismatch for
phram_setup).
