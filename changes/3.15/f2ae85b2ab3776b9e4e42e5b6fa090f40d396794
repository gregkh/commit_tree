KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: fix GICD_ICFGR register accesses

Since KVM internally represents the ICFGR registers by stuffing two
of them into one word, the offset for accessing the internal
representation and the one for the MMIO based access are different.
So keep the original offset around, but adjust the internal array
offset by one bit.
