smp: Rename __smp_call_function_single() to smp_call_function_single_async()

The name __smp_call_function_single() doesn't tell much about the
properties of this function, especially when compared to
smp_call_function_single().

The comments above the implementation are also misleading. The main
point of this function is actually not to be able to embed the csd
in an object. This is actually a requirement that result from the
purpose of this function which is to raise an IPI asynchronously.

As such it can be called with interrupts disabled. And this feature
comes at the cost of the caller who then needs to serialize the
IPIs on this csd.

Lets rename the function and enhance the comments so that they reflect
these properties.
