ARM: integrator: select GPIO block

The Integrator/AP can be used with a logic module called
IM-PD1, which contains a few AMBA PrimeCell devices, one of which
is the PL061 GPIO controller. As the lines from this GPIO
controller are looped back to devices on the board itself and
provides resources back to it, we need to always have GPIO
and the PL061 driver available for other devices to work.
