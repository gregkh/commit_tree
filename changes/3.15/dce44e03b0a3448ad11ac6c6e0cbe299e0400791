compat: Fix sparse address space warnings

In compat_sys_old_getrlimit() we pass a kernel pointer to
sys_old_getrlimit() inside a set_fs() bracket.  This is okay, so we
can safely cast the affected pointer to __user.

In compat_clock_nanosleep_restart(), the variable "rmtp" holds a user
pointer.  Annotate it as such.

Both of these warnings are ancient, but were reported by Fengguang
Wu's test system due to other changes.
