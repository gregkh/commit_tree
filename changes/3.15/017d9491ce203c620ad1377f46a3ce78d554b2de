ASoC: pcm: Drop incorrect double/extra frees

The changes in "ASoC: pcm: free path list before exiting from error
conditions" actually introduced both double frees (in case where the
path list was allocated but empty) and frees of unallocated memory (in
cases where the error being handled was -ENOMEM.  Drop the commit for
now.
