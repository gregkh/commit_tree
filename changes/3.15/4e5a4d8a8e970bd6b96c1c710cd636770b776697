[media] vb2: fix read/write regression

Commit 88e268702bfba78448abd20a31129458707383aa ("vb2: Improve file I/O
emulation to handle buffers in any order") broke read/write support if
the size of the buffer being read/written is less than the size of the
image.

When the commit was tested originally I used qv4l2, which calls read()
with exactly the size of the image. But if you try 'cat /dev/video0'
then it will fail and typically hang after reading two buffers.

This patch fixes the behavior by adding a new cur_index field that
contains the index of the field currently being filled/read, or it
is num_buffers in which case a new buffer needs to be dequeued.

The old index field has been renamed to initial_index in order to be
a bit more descriptive.

This has been tested with both read and write.
