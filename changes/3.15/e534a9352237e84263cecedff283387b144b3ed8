HID: sony: do not rely on hid_output_raw_report

hid_out_raw_report is going to be obsoleted as it is not part of the
unified HID low level transport documentation
(Documentation/hid/hid-transport.txt)

To do so, we need to introduce two new quirks:
* HID_QUIRK_NO_OUTPUT_REPORTS_ON_INTR_EP: this quirks prevents the
  transport driver to use the interrupt channel to send output report
  (and thus force to use HID_REQ_SET_REPORT command)
* HID_QUIRK_SKIP_OUTPUT_REPORT_ID: this one forces usbhid to not
  include the report ID in the buffer it sends to the device through
  HID_REQ_SET_REPORT in case of an output report

This also fixes a regression introduced in commit 3a75b24949a8
(HID: hidraw: replace hid_output_raw_report() calls by appropriates ones).
The hidraw API was not able to communicate with the PS3 SixAxis
controllers in USB mode.
