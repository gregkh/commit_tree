[media] vb2: fix streamoff handling if streamon wasn't called

If you request buffers, then queue buffers and then call STREAMOFF
those buffers are not returned to their dequeued state because streamoff
will just return if q->streaming was 0.

This means that afterwards you can never QBUF that same buffer again unless
you do STREAMON, REQBUFS or close the filehandle first.

It is clear that if you do STREAMOFF even if no STREAMON was called before,
you still want to have all buffers returned to their proper dequeued state.
