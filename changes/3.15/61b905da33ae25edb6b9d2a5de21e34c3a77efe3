net: Rename skb->rxhash to skb->hash

The packet hash can be considered a property of the packet, not just
on RX path.

This patch changes name of rxhash and l4_rxhash skbuff fields to be
hash and l4_hash respectively. This includes changing uses of the
field in the code which don't call the access functions.
