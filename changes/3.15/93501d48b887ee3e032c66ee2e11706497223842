ixgbe: implement SIOCGHWTSTAMP ioctl

This patch adds support for the new SIOCGHWTSTAMP ioctl, which enables a
process to determine the current timestamp configuration. In order to
implement this, store a copy of the timestamp configuration. In
addition, we can remove the 'int cmd' parameter as the new set_ts_config
function doesn't use it. I also fixed a typo in the function
description.
