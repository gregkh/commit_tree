drm/i915: Perform pageflip using mmio if the GPU is terminally wedged

After a hang and failed reset, we cannot use the GPU to execute the page
flip instructions. Instead we can force a synchronous mmio flip. (Later,
we can reduce the synchronicity of the mmio flip by moving some of the
delays off to a worker, like the current page flip code; see vblank
tasks.)
