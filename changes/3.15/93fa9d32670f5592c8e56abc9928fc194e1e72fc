PCI: shpchp: Check bridge's secondary (not primary) bus speed

When a new device is added below a hotplug bridge, the bridge's secondary
bus speed and the device's bus speed must match.  The shpchp driver
previously checked the bridge's *primary* bus speed, not the secondary bus
speed.

This caused hot-add errors like:

  shpchp 0000:00:03.0: Speed of bus ff and adapter 0 mismatch

Check the secondary bus speed instead.
