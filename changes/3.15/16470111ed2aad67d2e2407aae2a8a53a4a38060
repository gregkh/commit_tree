tipc: make discovery domain a bearer attribute

The node discovery domain is assigned when a bearer is enabled.
In the previous commit we reflect this attribute directly in the
bearer structure since it's needed to reinitialize the node
discovery mechanism after a hardware address change.

There's no need to replicate this attribute anywhere else, so we
remove it from the tipc_link_req structure.
