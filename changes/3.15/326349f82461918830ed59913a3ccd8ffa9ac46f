uas: add dead request list

This patch adds a new list where all requests which are canceled are
added to, so we don't loose them.  Then, after killing all inflight
urbs on bus reset (and disconnect) we'll walk over the list and clean
them up.

Without this we can end up with aborted requests lingering around in
case of status pipe transfer errors.
