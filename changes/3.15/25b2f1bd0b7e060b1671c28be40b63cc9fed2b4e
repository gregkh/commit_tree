ARM: bcm2835: node name unit address cleanup

DT nodes that contain a reg property should include a unit address in
their name. Add the missing unit addresses.

The unit address in a node name must match the value in the reg property.
Fix the cases where they don't match.

Don't fix the /clocks/* node names yet; that causes problems the clock
driver to attempt to register multiple clocks with the same name, which
fails.
