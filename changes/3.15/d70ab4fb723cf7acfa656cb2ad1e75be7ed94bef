dm: remove dm_get_mapinfo

Remove dm_get_mapinfo() because no target uses it.  Targets can allocate
per-bio data using ti->per_bio_data_size, this is much more flexible
than union map_info.

Leave union map_info only for the request-based multipath target's use.
Also delete the unused "unsigned long long ll" field of union map_info.
