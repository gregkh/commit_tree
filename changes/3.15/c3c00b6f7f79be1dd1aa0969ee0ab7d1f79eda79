serial: st-asc: Fix SysRq char handling

This driver, like several others, uses the upper bits of the character
to track both real and dummy state. Unfortunately it neglects to mask
these bits properly when passing the character data around. This means
neither break detection nor sysrq character handling work correctly.

This patch adds the requires masking and has been tested to confirm
that it correctly handles magic sysrq sequences on ST's B2020 board.
