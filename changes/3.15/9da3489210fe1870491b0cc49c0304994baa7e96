powerpc/pseries: Expose in kernel device tree update to drmgr

Traditionally it has been drmgr's responsibilty to update the device tree
through the /proc/ppc64/ofdt interface after a suspend/resume operation.
This patchset however has modified suspend/resume ops to preform an update
entirely in the kernel during the resume. Therefore, a mechanism is required
to expose that information to drmgr.

This patch adds a show function to the "hibernate" attribute that returns 1
if the kernel performs a device tree update after the resume and 0 otherwise.
This allows newer versions of drmgr to avoid doing a second unnecessary
device tree update.
