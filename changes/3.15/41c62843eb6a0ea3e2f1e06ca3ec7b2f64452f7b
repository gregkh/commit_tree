ixgbe: Fix rcu warnings induced by LER

Resolve some rcu warnings produced when LER actions take place.
This appears to be due to not holding the rtnl lock when calling
ixgbe_down, so hold the lock. Also avoid disabling the device
when it is already disabled. This check is necessary because the
callback can be called more than once in some cases.
