net: Replace u64_stats_fetch_begin_bh to u64_stats_fetch_begin_irq

Replace the bh safe variant with the hard irq safe variant.

We need a hard irq safe variant to deal with netpoll transmitting
packets from hard irq context, and we need it in most if not all of
the places using the bh safe variant.

Except on 32bit uni-processor the code is exactly the same so don't
bother with a bh variant, just have a hard irq safe variant that
everyone can use.
