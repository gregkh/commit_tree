ARM: davinci: remove tnetv107x support

The tnetv107x support does not compile, and seems to have been broken
for a while with nobody caring to fix it. So far everyone I asked
said it's probably dead and completely unused and will never again
be needed in a future kernel release, so let's delete it.

If someone finds a use for this code later and is able to get it
to work again, we can always revert the removal.
