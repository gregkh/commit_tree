atl1c: Call dev_kfree/consume_skb_any instead of dev_kfree_skb.

The call path: atl1c_xmit_frame, atlc_tx_rollback, atl1c_clean_buffer
can not be tell at compile time if it will be invoked from hard irq
or other context, as atl1c_xmit_frame does not know.  So remove
the logic that  passes the compile time knowledge into al1c_clean_buffer
and figure out it out at runtime with dev_consume_skb_any.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_kfree_skb_any in atl1c_xmit_frame that
can be called in hard irq and other contexts.

Replace dev_kfree_skb and dev_kfree_skb_irq with dev_consume_skb_any
in atl1c_clean_buffer that can be called in hard irq and other
contexts.
