PNP / ACPI: Do not return errors if _DIS or _SRS are not present

The ACPI PNP subsystem returns errors from pnpacpi_set_resources()
and pnpacpi_disable_resources() if the _SRS or _DIS methods are not
present, respectively, but it should not do that, because those
methods are optional.  For this reason, modify pnpacpi_set_resources()
and pnpacpi_disable_resources(), respectively, to ignore missing _SRS
or _DIS.

This problem has been uncovered by commit 202317a573b2 (ACPI / scan:
Add acpi_device objects for all device nodes in the namespace) and
manifested itself by causing serial port suspend to fail on some
systems.
