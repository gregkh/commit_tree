cpuidle: Do not substract exit latency from assumed sleep length

The menu governor statistics update function tries to determine the
amount of time between entry to low power state and the occurrence
of the wakeup event. However, the time measured by the framework
includes exit latency on top of the desired value. This exit latency
is substracted from the measured value to obtain the desired value.

When measured value is not available, the menu governor assumes
the wakeup was caused by the timer and the time is equal to remaining
timer length. No exit latency should be substracted from this value.

This patch prevents the erroneous substraction and clarifies the
associated comment. It also removes one intermediate variable that
serves no purpose.
