ceph: use fl->fl_file as owner identifier of flock and posix lock

flock and posix lock should use fl->fl_file instead of process ID
as owner identifier. (posix lock uses fl->fl_owner. fl->fl_owner
is usually equal to fl->fl_file, but it also can be a customized
value). The process ID of who holds the lock is just for F_GETLK
fcntl(2).

The fix is rename the 'pid' fields of struct ceph_mds_request_args
and struct ceph_filelock to 'owner', rename 'pid_namespace' fields
to 'pid'. Assign fl->fl_file to the 'owner' field of lock messages.
We also set the most significant bit of the 'owner' field. MDS can
use that bit to distinguish between old and new clients.

The MDS counterpart of this patch modifies the flock code to not
take the 'pid_namespace' into consideration when checking conflict
locks.
