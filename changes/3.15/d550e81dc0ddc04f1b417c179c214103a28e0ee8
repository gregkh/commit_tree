timers: Reduce __run_timers() latency for empty list

The __run_timers() function currently steps through the list one jiffy at
a time in order to update the timer wheel.  However, if the timer wheel
is empty, no adjustment is needed other than updating ->timer_jiffies.
In this case, which is likely to be common for NO_HZ_FULL kernels, the
kernel currently incurs a large latency for no good reason.  This commit
therefore short-circuits this case.
