watchdog: orion: Make sure the watchdog is initially stopped

Having the watchdog initially fully stopped is important to avoid
any spurious watchdog triggers, in case the registers are not in
its reset state.

If the watchdog rstout is enabled and the watchdog counter running,
this initial stop is not performed, to comply with the 'nowayout'
parameter.
