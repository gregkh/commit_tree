fanotify: move unrelated handling from copy_event_to_user()

Move code moving event structure to access_list from copy_event_to_user()
to fanotify_read() where it is more logical (so that we can immediately
see in the main loop that we either move the event to a different list
or free it).  Also move special error handling for permission events
from copy_event_to_user() to the main loop to have it in one place with
error handling for normal events.  This makes copy_event_to_user()
really only copy the event to user without any side effects.
