checkpatch: fix jiffies comparison and others

checkpatch could not distinguish between a variable in a struct named
jiffies and the normal jiffies.

	foo->jiffies

would emit a "Comparing jiffies" arning.

Update the $Compare variable to do a negative look-behind for "-" when
finding a ">" so that a pointer dereference like -> isn't a comparison.
