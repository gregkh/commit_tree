powerpc: Rename duplicate COMMAND_LINE_SIZE define

We have two definitions of COMMAND_LINE_SIZE, one for the kernel
and one for the boot wrapper. I assume this is so the boot
wrapper can be self sufficient and not rely on kernel headers.

Having two defines with the same name is confusing, I just
updated the wrong one when trying to bump it.

Make the boot wrapper define unique by calling it
BOOT_COMMAND_LINE_SIZE.
