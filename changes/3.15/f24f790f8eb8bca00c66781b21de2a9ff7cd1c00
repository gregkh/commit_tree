net/mlx4_core: Load the Eth driver first

When running in SRIOV mode, VM that is assigned with a non-provisioned
Ethernet VFs get themselves a random mac when the Eth driver starts. In
this case, if the IB driver startup code that deals with RoCE runs first,
it will use a zero mac as the source mac for the Para-Virtual CM MADs
which is buggy. To handle that, we change the order of loading.
