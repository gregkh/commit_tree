more graceful recovery in umount_collect()

Start with shrink_dcache_parent(), then scan what remains.

First of all, BUG() is very much an overkill here; we are holding
->s_umount, and hitting BUG() means that a lot of interesting stuff
will be hanging after that point (sync(2), for example).  Moreover,
in cases when there had been more than one leak, we'll be better
off reporting all of them.  And more than just the last component
of pathname - %pd is there for just such uses...

That was the last user of dentry_lru_del(), so kill it off...
