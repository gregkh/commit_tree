NVMe: IOCTL path RCU protect queue access

This adds rcu protected access to a queue in the nvme IOCTL path
to fix potential races between a surprise removal and queue usage in
nvme_submit_sync_cmd. The fix holds the rcu_read_lock() here to prevent
the nvme_queue from freeing while this path is executing so it can't
sleep, and so this path will no longer wait for a available command
id should they all be in use at the time a passthrough IOCTL request
is received.
