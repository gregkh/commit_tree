Bluetooth: Introduce hdev->pend_le_conn list

This patch introduces the hdev->pend_le_conn list which holds the
device addresses the kernel should autonomously connect. It also
introduces some helper functions to manipulate the list.

The list and helper functions will be used by the next patch which
implements the LE auto connection infrastructure.
