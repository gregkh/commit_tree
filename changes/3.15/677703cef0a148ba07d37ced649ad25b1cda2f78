efi: Add separate 32-bit/64-bit definitions

The traditional approach of using machine-specific types such as
'unsigned long' does not allow the kernel to interact with firmware
running in a different CPU mode, e.g. 64-bit kernel with 32-bit EFI.

Add distinct EFI structure definitions for both 32-bit and 64-bit so
that we can use them in the 32-bit and 64-bit code paths.
