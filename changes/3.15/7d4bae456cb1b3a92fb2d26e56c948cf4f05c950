staging/lustre/mgs: set_param -P option that sets value permanently

set_param and conf_param have different syntaxes. Also conf_param
has unimplemented paths and no wildcarding support.

This patch adds set_param -P option, that replaces the whole
conf_param "direct" proc access with a simple upcall-type mechanism
from the MGC. Option conf_param is saved now for compatibility.

Part of the original Lustre commit changes server code.
The patch only picks up client side change.
