fs/mbcache.c: change block and index hash chain to hlist_bl_node

This patch changes each mb_cache's both block and index hash chains to
use a hlist_bl_node, which contains a built-in lock.  This is the
first step in decoupling of locks serializing accesses to mb_cache
global data and each mb_cache_entry local data.
