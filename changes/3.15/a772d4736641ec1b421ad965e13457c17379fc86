matroxfb: restore the registers M_ACCESS and M_PITCH

When X11 is running and the user switches back to console, the card
modifies the content of registers M_MACCESS and M_PITCH in periodic
intervals.

This patch fixes it by restoring the content of these registers before
issuing any accelerator command.
