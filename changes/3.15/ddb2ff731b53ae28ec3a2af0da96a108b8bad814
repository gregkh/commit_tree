ARM: 7940/1: add support for the Cortex-A12 processor

The A12 behaves as the A7/A15 does with respect to setting the SMP bit, and
doesn't require TLB ops broadcasting to be explicitly enabled like the A9 does.

Note that as the ACTLR cannot (usually) be written from non-secure, it is the
responsibility of the bootloader/firmware to set this bit per core - it is
done here in Linux as last resort in case of bad firmware.
