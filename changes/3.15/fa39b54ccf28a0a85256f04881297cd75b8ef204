can: c_can: Get rid of pointless interrupts

The driver handles pointlessly TWO interrupts per packet. The reason
is that it enables the status interrupt which fires for each rx and tx
packet and it enables the per message object interrupts as well.

The status interrupt merily acks or in case of D_CAN ignores the TX/RX
state and then the message object interrupt fires.

The message objects interrupts are only useful if all message objects
have hardware filters activated.

But we don't have that and its not simple to implement in that driver
without rewriting it completely.

So we can ditch the message object interrupts and handle the RX/TX
right away from the status interrupt. Instead of TWO we handle ONE.

Note: We must keep the TXIE/RXIE bits in the message buffers because
the status interrupt alone is not reliable enough in corner cases.

If we ever have the need for HW filtering, then this code needs a
complete overhaul and we can think about it then. For now we prefer a
lower interrupt load.
