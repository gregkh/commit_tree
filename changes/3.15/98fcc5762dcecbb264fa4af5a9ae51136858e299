mmc: rtsx: Revert "mmc: rtsx: add support for pre_req and post_req"

This reverts commit c42deffd5b53c9e583d83c7964854ede2f12410d.

commit <mmc: rtsx: add support for pre_req and post_req> did use
mutex_unlock() in tasklet, but mutex_unlock() can't be used in
tasklet(atomic context). The driver needs to use mutex to avoid
concurrency, so we can't use tasklet here, the patch need to be
removed.

The spinlock host->lock and pcr->lock may deadlock, one way to solve
the deadlock is remove host->lock in sd_isr_done_transfer(), but if
using workqueue the we can avoid using the spinlock and also avoid
the problem.
