drm/i915: Prevent recursion by retiring requests when the ring is full

As the VM do not track activity of objects and instead use a large
hammer to forcibly idle and evict all of their associated objects when
one is released, it is possible for that to cause a recursion when we
need to wait for free space on a ring and call retire requests.
(intel_ring_begin -> intel_ring_wait_request ->
i915_gem_retire_requests_ring -> i915_gem_context_free ->
i915_gem_evict_vm -> i915_gpu_idle -> intel_ring_begin etc)

In order to remove the requirement for calling retire-requests from
intel_ring_wait_request, we have to inline a couple of steps from
retiring requests, notably we have to record the position of the request
we wait for and use that to update the available ring space.
