ARM: dts: kirkwood: fix mislocated pcie-controller nodes

Commit 54397d85349f
 ("ARM: kirkwood: Relocate PCIe device tree nodes")

moved the pcie-controller nodes for the Kirkwood SoCs to the mbus
bus node. For some reason, two boards were not properly converted
and have their pci-controller nodes still in the ocp bus node.

As the corresponding SoC pcie-controller does not exist anymore,
it is likely that pcie is broken on those boards since above commit.
Fix it by moving the pcie related nodes to the correct location.
