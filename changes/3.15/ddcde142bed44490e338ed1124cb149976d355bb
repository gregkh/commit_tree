slip: fix spinlock variant

With commit cc9fa74e2a ("slip/slcan: added locking in wakeup function") a
formerly missing locking was added to slip.c and slcan.c by Andre Naujoks.

Alexander Stein contributed the fix 367525c8c2 ("can: slcan: Fix spinlock
variant") as the kernel lock debugging advised to use spin_lock_bh() instead
of just using spin_lock().

This fix has to be applied to the same code section in slip.c for the same
reason too.
