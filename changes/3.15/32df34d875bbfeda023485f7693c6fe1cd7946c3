[media] rc: img-ir: jvc: Remove unused no-leader timings

The JVC timings included timings intended for the secondary decoder
(which matches messages with no leader), however they were in the wrong
part of the timings structure, repeating s00 and s01 rather than being
in s10 and s11.

Distinct repeat timings can't be properly supported yet for JVC anyway
since the scancode callback cannot determine which decoder matched the
message, so for now remove these timings and don't bother to enable the
secondary decoder.

This fixes the following warnings with W=1:
drivers/media/rc/img-ir/img-ir-jvc.c +76 :3: warning: initialized field overwritten [-Woverride-init]
drivers/media/rc/img-ir/img-ir-jvc.c +76 :3: warning: (near initialization for ‘img_ir_jvc.timings.s00’) [-Woverride-init]

drivers/media/rc/img-ir/img-ir-jvc.c +81 :3: warning: (near initialization for ‘img_ir_jvc.timings.s01’) [-Woverride-init]
