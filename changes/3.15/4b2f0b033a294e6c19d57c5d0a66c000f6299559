cpuidle: poll state can measure residency

For some platforms, a poll state is inserted in the cpuidle driver states.
The flags for the state do not indicate that timekeeping is not affected.
As the state does not do anything apart from calling cpu_relax(), the
times returned by ktime_get should remain valid. Add the missing flag.
