selftests/powerpc: Import Anton's memcpy / copy_tofrom_user tests

Turn Anton's memcpy / copy_tofrom_user test into something that can
live in tools/testing/selftests.

It requires one turd in arch/powerpc/lib/memcpy_64.S, but it's pretty
harmless IMHO.

We are sailing very close to the wind with the feature macros. We define
them to nothing, which currently means we get a few extra nops and
include the unaligned calls.
