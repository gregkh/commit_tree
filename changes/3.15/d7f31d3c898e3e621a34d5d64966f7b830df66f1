ASoC: wm8962: Replace codec->control_data with wm8962->regmap

With the ongoing component-ization of the ASoC framework and the continuing
migration to using regmap for IO the control_data field of the snd_soc_codec
struct will eventually be removed. Prepare the wm8962 driver for this by using
wm8962->regmap instead of accessing the CODEC's control_data field.
