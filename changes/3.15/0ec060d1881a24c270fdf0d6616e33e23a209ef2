nilfs2: verify metadata sizes read from disk

Add code to check sizes of on-disk data of metadata files such as inode
size, segment usage size, DAT entry size, and checkpoint size.  Although
these sizes are read from disk, the current implementation doesn't check
them.

If these sizes are not sane on disk, it can cause out-of-range access to
metadata or memory access overrun on metadata block buffers due to
overflow in sundry calculations.

Both lower limit and upper limit of metadata sizes are verified to
prevent these issues.
