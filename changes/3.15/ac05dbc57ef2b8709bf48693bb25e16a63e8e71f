drm: Make control nodes master-less v3

Like for render-nodes, there is no point in maintaining the master concept
for control nodes, so set the struct drm_file::master pointer to NULL.

At the same time, make sure DRM_MASTER | DRM_CONTROL_ALLOW ioctls are always
allowed when called through the control node. Previously the caller also
needed to be master.

v2: Adapt to refactoring of ioctl permission check.
v3: Formatting of logical expression. Use drm_is_control_client() instead of
    drm_is_control().
