cpufreq: create another field .flags in cpufreq_frequency_table

Currently cpufreq frequency table has two fields: frequency and driver_data.
driver_data is only for drivers' internal use and cpufreq core shouldn't use
it at all. But with the introduction of BOOST frequencies, this assumption
was broken and we started using it as a flag instead.

There are two problems due to this:
- It is against the description of this field, as driver's data is used by
  the core now.
- if drivers fill it with -3 for any frequency, then those frequencies are
  never considered by cpufreq core as it is exactly same as value of
  CPUFREQ_BOOST_FREQ, i.e. ~2.

The best way to get this fixed is by creating another field flags which
will be used for such flags. This patch does that. Along with that various
drivers need modifications due to the change of struct cpufreq_frequency_table.
