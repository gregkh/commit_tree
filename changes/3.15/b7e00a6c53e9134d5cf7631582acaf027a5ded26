ftrace: Add private data to ftrace_ops

Passing data to the function callback was originally done by adding the
ftrace_ops in another structure, and using the container_of() to get
the field. But this adds a bit more complexity than it is worth, and
adding a simple .private field to ftrace_ops makes things a lot easier.

But be warned, the .private data should not be freed once it is used
unless the ftrace_ops itself has gone through the necessary freeing
routines. A simple synchronize_sched() is not enough as functions
can be traced that are called outside the view of RCU and all its
concoctions.
