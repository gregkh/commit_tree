mtd: nand: kill the the NAND_MAX_PAGESIZE/NAND_MAX_OOBSIZE for nand_buffers{}

The patch converts the arrays to buffer pointers for nand_buffers{}.

The cafe_nand.c is the only NAND_OWN_BUFFERS user which allocates
nand_buffers{} itself.

This patch disables the DMA for nand_scan_ident, and restores the DMA
status after we finish the nand_scan_ident. This way, we can get page
size and OOB size and use them to allocate cafe->dmabuf.

Since the cafe_nand.c uses the NAND_ECC_HW_SYNDROME ECC mode, we do not
allocate the buffers for @ecccalc and @ecccode.
