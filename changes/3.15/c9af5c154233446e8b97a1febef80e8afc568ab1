[media] lgdt3305: include sleep functionality in lgdt3304_ops

Add sleep ops to lgdt3304_ops to invoke lgdt3305_sleep() to be called
from dvb_frontend_suspend(). lgdt3305_soft_reset() is called for both
3304 and 3305 devices. soft_reset and sleep touch LGDT3305_GEN_CTRL_3
on 3304 and 3305 devices. Hence, adding sleep to lgdt3304_ops will help
suspend 3304 properly from dvb_frontend_suspend().
