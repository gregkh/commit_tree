ASoC: cache: Do the codec->reg_cache zero pionter check

For the snd_soc_cache_init(), the reg_size maybe zero and then the value
of codec->reg_cache, which is alloced via kzalloc, maybe equal to
ZERO_SIZE_PTR. If the reg parameter of snd_soc_cache_write() is large enough,
the cache[idx] = val maybe cause the kernel crash...

So this patch fix this via doing the zero pionter check of it.
