qlcnic: Fix MSI-X initialization code

Function qlcnic_setup_tss_rss_intr() might enter endless
loop in case pci_enable_msix() contiguously returns a
positive number of MSI-Xs that could have been allocated.
Besides, the function contains 'err = -EIO;' assignment
that never could be reached. This update fixes the
aforementioned issues.
