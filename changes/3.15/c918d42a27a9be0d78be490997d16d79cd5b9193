locks: make /proc/locks show IS_FILE_PVT locks as type "FLPVT"

In a later patch, we'll be adding a new type of lock that's owned by
the struct file instead of the files_struct. Those sorts of locks
will be flagged with a new FL_FILE_PVT flag.

Report these types of locks as "FLPVT" in /proc/locks to distinguish
them from "classic" POSIX locks.
