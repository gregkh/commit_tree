[media] drx-j: get rid of most of the typedefs

There are lots of typedefs there. Let's get rid of them.

Most of the work here is due to this small script:

	if [ "$3" == "" ]; then
		echo "usage: $0 type DRXName drx_name"
	fi
	t=$1; f=$2; g=$3
	for i in *.[ch]; do
		sed s,"p${f}_t","$t $g *",g <$i >a && mv a $i && \
		sed s,"${f}_t","$t $g",g <$i >a && mv a $i
	done

Just kept there the function typedefs, as those are still useful.

Yet, all those tuner_ops can likely be just removed on a latter
cleanup patch.
