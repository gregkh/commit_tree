drivers/net: Use RCU_INIT_POINTER(x, NULL) in bonding/bond_options.c

This patch replaces rcu_assign_pointer(x, NULL) with RCU_INIT_POINTER(x, NULL)

The rcu_assign_pointer() ensures that the initialization of a structure
is carried out before storing a pointer to that structure.
And in the case of the NULL pointer, there is no structure to initialize.
So, rcu_assign_pointer(p, NULL) can be safely converted to RCU_INIT_POINTER(p, NULL)
