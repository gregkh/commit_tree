ipsec: add support of limited SA dump

The goal of this patch is to allow userland to dump only a part of SA by
specifying a filter during the dump.
The kernel is in charge to filter SA, this avoids to generate useless netlink
traffic (it save also some cpu cycles). This is particularly useful when there
is a big number of SA set on the system.

Note that I removed the union in struct xfrm_state_walk to fix a problem on arm.
struct netlink_callback->args is defined as a array of 6 long and the first long
is used in xfrm code to flag the cb as initialized. Hence, we must have:
sizeof(struct xfrm_state_walk) <= sizeof(long) * 5.
With the union, it was false on arm (sizeof(struct xfrm_state_walk) was
sizeof(long) * 7), due to the padding.
In fact, whatever the arch is, this union seems useless, there will be always
padding after it. Removing it will not increase the size of this struct (and
reduce it on arm).
