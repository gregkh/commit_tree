PCI: Remove pci_find_parent_resource() use for allocation

If the resource hasn't been allocated yet, pci_find_parent_resource() is
documented as returning the region "where it should be allocated from."
This is impossible in general because there may be several candidates: a
prefetchable BAR can be put in either a prefetchable or non-prefetchable
window, a transparent bridge may have overlapping positively- and
subtractively-decoded windows, and a root bus may have several windows of
the same type.

Allocation should be done by pci_bus_alloc_resource(), which iterates
through all bus resources and looks for the best match, e.g., one with the
desired prefetchability attributes, and falls back to less-desired
possibilities.

The only valid use of pci_find_parent_resource() is to find the parent of
an already-allocated resource so we can claim it via request_resource(),
and all we need for that is a bus region of the correct type that contains
the resource.

Note that like 8c8def26bfaa ("PCI: allow matching of prefetchable resources
to non-prefetchable windows"), this depends on pci_bus_for_each_resource()
iterating through positively-decoded regions before subtractively-decoded
ones.  We prefer not to return a subtractively-decoded region because
requesting from it will likely conflict with the overlapping positively-
decoded window (see Launchpad report below).
