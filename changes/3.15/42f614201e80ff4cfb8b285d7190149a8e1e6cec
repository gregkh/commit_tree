NVMe: per-cpu io queues

The device's IO queues are associated with CPUs, so we can use a per-cpu
variable to map the a qid to a cpu. This provides a convienient way
to optimally assign queues to multiple cpus when the device supports
fewer queues than the host has cpus. The previous implementation may
have assigned these poorly in these situations. This patch addresses
this by sharing queues among cpus that are "close" together and should
have a lower lock contention penalty.
