Input: elantech - fix touchpad initialization on Gigabyte U2442

The hw_version 3 Elantech touchpad on the Gigabyte U2442 does not accept
0x0b as initialization value for r10, this stand-alone version of the
driver: http://planet76.com/drivers/elantech/psmouse-elantech-v6.tar.bz2

Uses 0x03 which does work, so this means not setting bit 3 of r10 which
sets: "Enable Real H/W Resolution In Absolute mode"

Which will result in half the x and y resolution we get with that bit set,
so simply not setting it everywhere is not a solution. We've been unable to
find a way to identify touchpads where setting the bit will fail, so this
patch uses a dmi based blacklist for this.
