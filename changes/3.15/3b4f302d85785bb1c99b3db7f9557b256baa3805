tipc: eliminate redundant locking

The three functions tipc_portimportance(), tipc_portunreliable() and
tipc_portunreturnable() and their corresponding tipc_set* functions,
are all grabbing port_lock when accessing the targeted port. This is
unnecessary in the current code, since these calls only are made from
within socket downcalls, already protected by sock_lock.

We remove the redundant locking. Also, since the functions now become
trivial one-liners, we move them to port.h and make them inline.
