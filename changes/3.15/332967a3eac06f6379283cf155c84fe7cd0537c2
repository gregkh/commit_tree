x86: kvm: introduce periodic global clock updates

commit 0061d53daf26f introduced a mechanism to execute a global clock
update for a vm. We can apply this periodically in order to propagate
host NTP corrections. Also, if all vcpus of a vm are pinned, then
without an additional trigger, no guest NTP corrections can propagate
either, as the current trigger is only vcpu cpu migration.
