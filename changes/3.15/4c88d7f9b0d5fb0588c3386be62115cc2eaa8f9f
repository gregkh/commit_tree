genirq: Provide irq_force_affinity fallback for non-SMP

Patch 01f8fa4f01d "genirq: Allow forcing cpu affinity of interrupts" added
an irq_force_affinity() function, and 30ccf03b4a6 "clocksource: Exynos_mct:
Use irq_force_affinity() in cpu bringup" subsequently uses it. However, the
driver can be used with CONFIG_SMP disabled, but the function declaration
is only available for CONFIG_SMP, leading to this build error:

drivers/clocksource/exynos_mct.c:431:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'irq_force_affinity' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
   irq_force_affinity(mct_irqs[MCT_L0_IRQ + cpu], cpumask_of(cpu));

This patch introduces a dummy helper function for the non-SMP case
that always returns success, to get rid of the build error.
Since the patches causing the problem are marked for stable backports,
this one should be as well.
