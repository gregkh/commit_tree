blk-mq: allow blk_mq_init_commands() to return failure

If drivers do dynamic allocation in the hardware command init
path, then we need to be able to handle and return failures.

And if they do allocations or mappings in the init command path,
then we need a cleanup function to free up that space at exit
time. So add blk_mq_free_commands() as the cleanup function.

This is required for the mtip32xx driver conversion to blk-mq.
