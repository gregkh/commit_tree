Input: synaptics - change min/max quirk table to pnp-id matching

Most of the affected models share pnp-ids for the touchpad. So switching
to pnp-ids give us 2 advantages:
1) It shrinks the quirk list
2) It will lower the new quirk addition frequency, ie the recently added W540
   quirk would not have been necessary since it uses the same LEN0034 pnp ids
   as other models already added before it

As an added bonus it actually puts the quirk on the actual psmouse, rather
then on the machine, which is technically more correct.
