netpoll: Move rx enable/disable into __dev_close_many

Today netpoll_rx_enable and netpoll_rx_disable are called from
dev_close and and __dev_close, and not from dev_close_many.

Move the calls into __dev_close_many so that we have a single call
site to maintain, and so that dev_close_many gains this protection as
well.  Which importantly makes batched network device deletes safe.
