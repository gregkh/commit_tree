Staging: speakup: Move pasting into a work item

Input is handled in softirq context, but when pasting we may
need to sleep.  speakup_paste_selection() currently tries to
bodge this by busy-waiting if in_atomic(), but that doesn't
help because the ldisc may also sleep.

For bonus breakage, speakup_paste_selection() changes the
state of current, even though it's not running in process
context.

Move it into a work item and make sure to cancel it on exit.
