f2fs: fix to mark the checkpointed nat entry correctly

The nat cache entry maintains a status whether it is checkpointed or not.
So, if a new cache entry is loaded from the last checkpoint,
nat_entry->checkpointed should be true.
If the cache entry is modified as being dirty, nat_entry->checkpoint should
be false.
