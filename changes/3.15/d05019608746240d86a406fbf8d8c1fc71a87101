iommu/vt-d: Be less pessimistic about domain coherency where possible

In commit 2e12bc29 ("intel-iommu: Default to non-coherent for domains
unattached to iommus") we decided to err on the side of caution and
always assume that it's possible that a device will be attached which is
behind a non-coherent IOMMU.

In some cases, however, that just *cannot* happen. If there *are* no
IOMMUs in the system which are non-coherent, then we don't need to do
it. And flushing the dcache is a *significant* performance hit.
