6lowpan: fix fragmentation on sending side

This patch fix the fragmentation on sending side according to rfc4944.

Also add improvement to use the full payload of a PDU which calculate
the nearest divided to 8 payload length for the fragmentation datagram
size attribute.

The main issue is that the datagram size of fragmentation header use the
ipv6 payload length, but rfc4944 says it's the ipv6 payload length inclusive
network header size (and transport header size if compressed).
