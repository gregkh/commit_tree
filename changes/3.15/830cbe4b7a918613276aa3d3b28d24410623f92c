irqchip: armada-370-xp: implement the ->check_device() msi_chip operation

Until now, we were leaving the ->check_device() msi_chip operation
empty, which leads the PCI core to believe that we support both MSI
and MSI-X. In fact, we do not support MSI-X, so we have to tell this
to the PCI core by providing an implementation of this operation.
