MIPS: Add MSA register definitions & access

This patch introduces definitions for the MSA control registers and
functions which allow access to both the control & vector registers. If
the toolchain being used to build the kernel includes support for MSA
then this patch will make use of that support & use MSA instructions
directly. However toolchain support for MSA is very new & far from a
point where it can be reasonably expected that everyone building the
kernel uses a toolchain with support. Thus fallbacks using .word
assembler directives are also provided for now as a temporary measure.
