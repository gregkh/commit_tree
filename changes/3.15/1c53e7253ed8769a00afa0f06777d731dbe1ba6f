ALSA: usb-audio: Save mixer status only once at suspend

The suspend callback of usb-audio driver may be called multiple times
per suspend when multiple USB interfaces are bound to a single sound
card instance.  In such a case, it's superfluous to save the mixer
values multiple times.  This patch fixes it by checking the counter.
