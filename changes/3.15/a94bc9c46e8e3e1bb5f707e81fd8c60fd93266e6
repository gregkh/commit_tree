can: preserve skbuff protocol in can_put_echo_skb

The skbuff protocol value was formerly fixed/sanitized to ETH_P_CAN in
can_put_echo_skb(). With CAN FD this value has to be preserved.
This patch changes the hard assignment of the protocol value to a check of
valid protocol values for CAN and CAN FD.
