trace: module: Maintain a valid user count

The replacement of the 'count' variable by two variables 'incs' and
'decs' to resolve some race conditions during module unloading was done
in parallel with some cleanup in the trace subsystem, and was integrated
as a merge.

Unfortunately, the formula for this replacement was wrong in the tracing
code, and the refcount in the traces was not usable as a result.

Use 'count = incs - decs' to compute the user count.
