ARM: sun4i: dt: Add USB host nodes to hackberry dts

Add nodes for the usb-phy and ehci- and ohci-usb-host controllers.

Based on fex file settings, the fex file also contains a mysterious line:
usb_hub_vcc_en_gpio = port:PB09<1><0><default><0>

Which also clashes with usbc0, which has:
usb_drv_vbus_gpio = port:PB09<1><0><default><0>

So if usb does not work properly we need someone with a hackberry to look
closer into this.
