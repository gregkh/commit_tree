ath9k: add a recv budget

Implement a recv budget so that in cases of high traffic we still allow other
taskets to get processed.

Without this, we can encounter a host of issues during high wireless traffic
reception depending on system load including rcu stall's detected (ARM),
soft lockups, failure to service critical tasks such as watchdog resets,
and triggering of the tx stuck tasklet.

The same thing was proposed previously by Ben:

The only difference here is that I make sure only processed packets are counted
in the budget by checking at the end of the rx loop.
