video: move fbdev to drivers/video/fbdev

The drivers/video directory is a mess. It contains generic video related
files, directories for backlight, console, linux logo, lots of fbdev
device drivers, fbdev framework files.

Make some order into the chaos by creating drivers/video/fbdev
directory, and move all fbdev related files there.

No functionality is changed, although I guess it is possible that some
subtle Makefile build order related issue could be created by this
patch.
