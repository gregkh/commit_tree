lockdep: Make held_lock->check and "int check" argument bool

The "int check" argument of lock_acquire() and held_lock->check are
misleading. This is actually a boolean: 2 means "true", everything
else is "false".

And there is no need to pass 1 or 0 to lock_acquire() depending on
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING, __lock_acquire() checks prove_locking at the
start and clears "check" if !CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING.

Note: probably we can simply kill this member/arg. The only explicit
user of check => 0 is rcu_lock_acquire(), perhaps we can change it to
use lock_acquire(trylock =>, read => 2). __lockdep_no_validate means
check => 0 implicitly, but we can change validate_chain() to check
hlock->instance->key instead. Not to mention it would be nice to get
rid of lockdep_set_novalidate_class().
