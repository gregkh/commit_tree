ALSA: hda - Add hda_controller.c and move pcm ops from hda_intel

Pull the pcm_ops and the functions they use into a new hda_controller
file.  This is done to allow for other hda implementations besides PCI
to use the same ops.  The hda_controller file will house functionality
related to HDA but independent of the bus used to talk to the
controller.

This currently shares dsp locking across the two files.  This will be
remedied in a following commit.
