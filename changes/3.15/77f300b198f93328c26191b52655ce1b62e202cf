workqueue: fix bugs in wq_update_unbound_numa() failure path

wq_update_unbound_numa() failure path has the following two bugs.

- alloc_unbound_pwq() is called without holding wq->mutex; however, if
  the allocation fails, it jumps to out_unlock which tries to unlock
  wq->mutex.

- The function should switch to dfl_pwq on failure but didn't do so
  after alloc_unbound_pwq() failure.

Fix it by regrabbing wq->mutex and jumping to use_dfl_pwq on
alloc_unbound_pwq() failure.
