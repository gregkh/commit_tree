arm: dma-mapping: remove order parameter from arm_iommu_create_mapping()

The 'order' parameter for IOMMU-aware dma-mapping implementation was
introduced mainly as a hack to reduce size of the bitmap used for
tracking IO virtual address space. Since now it is possible to dynamically
resize the bitmap, this hack is not needed and can be removed without any
impact on the client devices. This way the parameters for
arm_iommu_create_mapping() becomes much easier to understand. 'size'
parameter now means the maximum supported IO address space size.

The code will allocate (resize) bitmap in chunks, ensuring that a single
chunk is not larger than a single memory page to avoid unreliable
allocations of size larger than PAGE_SIZE in atomic context.
