ftrace: Pass retval through return in ftrace_dyn_arch_init()

No architecture uses the "data" parameter in ftrace_dyn_arch_init() in any
way, it just sets the value to 0. And this is used as a return value
in the caller -- ftrace_init, which just checks the retval against
zero.

Note there is also "return 0" in every ftrace_dyn_arch_init.  So it is
enough to check the retval and remove all the indirect sets of data on
all archs.
