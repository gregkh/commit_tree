kconfig: make allnoconfig disable options behind EMBEDDED and EXPERT

"make allnoconfig" exists to ease testing of minimal configurations.
Documentation/SubmitChecklist includes a note to test with allnoconfig.
This helps catch missing dependencies on common-but-not-required
functionality, which might otherwise go unnoticed.

However, allnoconfig still leaves many symbols enabled, because they're
hidden behind CONFIG_EMBEDDED or CONFIG_EXPERT.  For instance, allnoconfig
still has CONFIG_PRINTK and CONFIG_BLOCK enabled, so drivers don't
typically get build-tested with those disabled.

To address this, introduce a new Kconfig option "allnoconfig_y", used on
symbols which only exist to hide other symbols.  Set it on CONFIG_EMBEDDED
(which then selects CONFIG_EXPERT).  allnoconfig will then disable all the
symbols hidden behind those.
