parisc: change value of SHMLBA from 0x00400000 to PAGE_SIZE

On parisc, SHMLBA was defined to 0x00400000 (4MB) to reflect that we need to
take care of our caches for shared mappings. But actually, we can map a file at
any multiple address of PAGE_SIZE, so let us correct that now with a value of
PAGE_SIZE for SHMLBA.  Instead we now take care of this cache colouring via the
constant SHM_COLOUR while we map shared pages.
