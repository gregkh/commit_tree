serial: pl011: change Rx burst size to half of trigger level

The amba-pl011.c driver sets DMA burst size equal to FIFO trigger level.
If now exactly DMA burst size bytes are received, the DMAC will retrieve
them all and no Rx timeout interrupt will be generated. To fix that set
the burst size to half the FIFO trigger level.
