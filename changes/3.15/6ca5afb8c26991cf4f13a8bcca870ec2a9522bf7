crypto: x86/sha1 - re-enable the AVX variant

Commit 7c1da8d0d0 "crypto: sha - SHA1 transform x86_64 AVX2"
accidentally disabled the AVX variant by making the avx_usable() test
not only fail in case the CPU doesn't support AVX or OSXSAVE but also
if it doesn't support AVX2.

Fix that regression by splitting up the AVX/AVX2 test into two
functions. Also test for the BMI1 extension in the avx2_usable() test
as the AVX2 implementation not only makes use of BMI2 but also BMI1
instructions.
