Staging: speakup: Update __speakup_paste_selection() tty (ab)usage to match vt

This function is largely a duplicate of paste_selection() in
drivers/tty/vt/selection.c, but with its own selection state.  The
speakup selection mechanism should really be merged with vt.

For now, apply the changes from 'TTY: vt, fix paste_selection ldisc
handling', 'tty: Make ldisc input flow control concurrency-friendly',
and 'tty: Fix unsafe vt paste_selection()'.
