drm/i915: Add reason for capture in error state

We capture error state not only when the GPU hangs but also on
other situations as in interrupt errors and in situations where
we can kick things forward without GPU reset. There will be log
entry on most of these cases. But as error state capture might be
only thing we have, if dmesg was not captured. Or as in GEN4 case,
interrupt error can trigger error state capture without log entry,
the exact reason why capture was made is hard to decipher.

v2: Split out the the error code stuff to separate patch (Ben)
