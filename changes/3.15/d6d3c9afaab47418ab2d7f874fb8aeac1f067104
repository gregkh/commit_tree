MIPS: MT: proc: Add support for printing VPE and TC ids

And there are more CPUs or configurations that want to provide special
per-CPU information in /proc/cpuinfo.  So I think there needs to be a
hook mechanism, such as a notifier.

This is a first cut only; I need to think about what sort of looking
the notifier needs to have.  But I'd appreciate testing on MT hardware!
