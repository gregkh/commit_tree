at86rf230: remove check if AVDD settled

The AVDD regulator is only enabled when the RF section is active TX_ON
(PLL_ON) state. Since commit 7dcbd22a97eb0689e6c583ad630ae0e7341e34c1
("ieee802154: ensure that first RF212 state comes from TRX_OFF").
We are in TRX_OFF state at the time at86rf230_hw_init is run.

Note that this test would only fail in case of a severe hardware
malfunction (faulty/shorted power supply, etc.) so it wasn't all that
useful in the first place.
