staging: comedi: pcl818: interrupt handlers should not busywait

The interrupt is only generated by the hardware at the completion of
an A/D conversion. Because of this the sanity check to make sure that
the A/D conversion is complete and data is available is probably
unnecessary but it doesn't hurt anything.

The busywait loop is a different issue. Interrupt routines should not
busywait. That's just mean...

Remove the bustwait and use pcl818_ai_eoc() to check for the end-of-
conversion.
