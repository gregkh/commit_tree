sched/numa, mm: Remove p->numa_migrate_deferred

Excessive migration of pages can hurt the performance of workloads
that span multiple NUMA nodes.  However, it turns out that the
p->numa_migrate_deferred knob is a really big hammer, which does
reduce migration rates, but does not actually help performance.

Now that the second stage of the automatic numa balancing code
has stabilized, it is time to replace the simplistic migration
deferral code with something smarter.
