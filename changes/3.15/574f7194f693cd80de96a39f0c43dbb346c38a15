net: Add a test to see if a skb is freeable in irq context

Currently netpoll and skb_release_head_state assume that a skb is
freeable in hard irq context except when skb->destructor is set.

The reality is far from this.  So add a function skb_irq_freeable to
compute the full test and in the process be the living documentation
of what the requirements are of actually freeing a skb in hard irq
context.
