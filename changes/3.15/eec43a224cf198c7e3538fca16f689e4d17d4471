MIPS: Save/restore MSA context around signals

This patch extends sigcontext in order to hold the most significant 64
bits of each vector register in addition to the MSA control & status
register. The least significant 64 bits are already saved as the scalar
FP context. This makes things a little awkward since the least & most
significant 64 bits of each vector register are not contiguous in
memory. Thus the copy_u & insert instructions are used to transfer the
values of the most significant 64 bits via GP registers.
