MIPS: Clear upper bits of FP registers on emulator writes

The upper bits of an FP register are architecturally defined as
unpredictable following an instructions which only writes the lower
bits. The prior behaviour of the kernel is to leave them unmodified.
This patch modifies that to clear the upper bits to zero. This is what
the MSA architecture reference manual specifies should happen for its
wider registers and is still permissible for scalar FP instructions
given the bits unpredictability there.
