arm64: fix !CONFIG_COMPAT build failures

Recent arm64 builds using CONFIG_ARM64_64K_PAGES are failing with:

  arch/arm64/kernel/perf_regs.c: In function ‘perf_reg_abi’:
  arch/arm64/kernel/perf_regs.c:41:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘is_compat_thread’

  arch/arm64/kernel/perf_event.c:1398:2: error: unknown type name ‘compat_uptr_t’

This is due to some recent arm64 perf commits with compat support:

  commit 23c7d70d55c6d9:
    ARM64: perf: add support for frame pointer unwinding in compat mode

  commit 2ee0d7fd36a3f8:
    ARM64: perf: add support for perf registers API

Those patches make the arm64 kernel unbuildable if CONFIG_COMPAT is not
defined and CONFIG_ARM64_64K_PAGES depends on !CONFIG_COMPAT. This patch
allows the arm64 kernel to build with and without CONFIG_COMPAT.
