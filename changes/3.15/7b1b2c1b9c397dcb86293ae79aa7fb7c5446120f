ext4: don't calculate total xattr header size unless needed

The function ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea() doesn't need the size of all
of the extended attribute headers.  So if we don't calculate it when
it is unneeded, it we can skip some undeeded memory references, and as
a bonus, we eliminate some kvetching by static code analysis tools.
