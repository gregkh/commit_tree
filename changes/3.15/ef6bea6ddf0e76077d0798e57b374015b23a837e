x86, ptdump: Add the functionality to dump an arbitrary pagetable

With reusing the ->trampoline_pgd page table for mapping EFI regions in
order to use them after having switched to EFI virtual mode, it is very
useful to be able to dump aforementioned page table in dmesg. This adds
that functionality through the walk_pgd_level() interface which can be
called from somewhere else.

The original functionality of dumping to debugfs remains untouched.
