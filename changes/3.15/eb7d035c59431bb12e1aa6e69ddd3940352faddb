tracepoint: Simplify tracepoint module search

Instead of copying the num_tracepoints and tracepoints_ptrs from
the module structure to the tp_mod structure, which only uses it to
find the module associated to tracepoints of modules that are coming
and going, simply copy the pointer to the module struct to the tracepoint
tp_module structure.

Also removed un-needed brackets around an if statement.
