can: sja1000_isa: add locking for indirect register access mode

When accessing the SJA1000 controller registers in the indirect access mode,
writing the register number and reading/writing the data has to be an atomic
attempt.

As the sja1000_isa driver is an old style driver with a fixed number of
instances the locking variable depends on the same index like all the other
configuration elements given on the module command line.

As a positive side effect dev->dev_id is populated by the instance index,
which was missing in 3e66d0138c05d9 ("can: populate netdev::dev_id for udev
discrimination").
