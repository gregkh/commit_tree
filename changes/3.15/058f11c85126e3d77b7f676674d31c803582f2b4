spi: qup: Depend on ARCH_QCOM

Commit 8fc1b0f87d9f ("ARM: qcom: Split Qualcomm support into legacy and
multiplatform") removed Kconfig symbol ARCH_MSM_DT. But that commit
left one (optional) dependency on ARCH_MSM_DT untouched.

Three Kconfig symbols used to depend on ARCH_MSM_DT: ARCH_MSM8X60,
ARCH_MSM8960, and ARCH_MSM8974. These three symbols now depend on
ARCH_QCOM. So it appears this driver needs to depend on ARCH_QCOM too.
