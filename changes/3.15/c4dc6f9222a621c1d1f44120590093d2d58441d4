[media] drx-j: call ctrl_set_standard even if a standard is powered

Modulation and other parameters might have changed. So, better
to call ctrl_set_standard() even if the device is already
powered.

That helps to put the device into a sane state, if something
got wrong on a previous set_frontend call.
