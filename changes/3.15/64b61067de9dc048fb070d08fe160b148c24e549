ARM: AM43x: hwmod data: register spinlock OCP interface

AM43xx has a spinlock module which is identical to the
one present on AM33xx. Register the spinlock ocp_if link
so that the spinlock hwmod and associated omap_device can
be instantiated, and the runtime pm API could be used by
the OMAP hwspinlock driver.
