KGDB: make kgdb_breakpoint() as noinline

The function kgdb_breakpoint() sets up break point at
compile time by calling arch_kgdb_breakpoint();
Though this call is surrounded by wmb() barrier,
the compile can still re-order the break point,
because this scheduling barrier is not a code motion
barrier in gcc.

Making kgdb_breakpoint() as noinline solves this problem
of code reording around break point instruction and also
avoids problem of being called as inline function from
other places
