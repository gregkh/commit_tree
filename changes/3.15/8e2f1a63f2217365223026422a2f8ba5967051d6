packet: fix packet_direct_xmit for BQL enabled drivers

Currently, in packet_direct_xmit() we test the assigned netdevice queue
for netif_xmit_frozen_or_stopped() before doing an ndo_start_xmit().

This can have the side-effect that BQL enabled drivers which make use
of netdev_tx_sent_queue() internally, set __QUEUE_STATE_STACK_XOFF from
within the stack and would not fully fill the device's TX ring from
packet sockets with PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS enabled.

Instead, use a test without BQL bit so that bursts can be absorbed
into the NICs TX ring. Fix and code suggested by Eric Dumazet, thanks!
