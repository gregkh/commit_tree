Bluetooth: Move address type conversion to outside hci_connect_le

This patch moves address type conversion (L2CAP address type to HCI
address type) to outside hci_connect_le. This way, we avoid back and
forth address type conversion in a comming patch.

So hci_connect_le() now expects 'dst_type' parameter in HCI address
type convention.
