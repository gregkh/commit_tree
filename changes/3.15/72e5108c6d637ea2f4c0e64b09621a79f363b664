Bluetooth: Don't fail RFCOMM tty writes

The tty driver api design prefers no-fail writes if the driver
write_room() method has previously indicated space is available
to accept writes. Since this is trivially possible for the
RFCOMM tty driver, do so.

Introduce rfcomm_dlc_send_noerror(), which queues but does not
schedule the krfcomm thread if the dlc is not yet connected
(and thus does not error based on the connection state).
The mtu size test is also unnecessary since the caller already
chunks the written data into mtu size.
