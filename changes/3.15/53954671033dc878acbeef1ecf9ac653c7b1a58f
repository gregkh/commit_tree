rcutorture: Do better bin packing

Running the standard set of rcutorture tests on 24 CPUs results in
the following sub-optimal schedule:

	----start batch----
	 TREE07 16
	----start batch----
	 TREE08 16
	 SRCU-P 8
	----start batch----
	 TREE01 8
	 TREE02 8
	 TREE03 8
	----start batch----
	 TREE04 8
	 TREE05 8
	 TREE06 8
	----start batch----
	 SRCU-N 4
	 TINY01 1
	 TINY02 1
	 TREE09 1

If one of the eight-CPU runs were to be moved into the first batch,
the test suite would complete in four batches rather than five.

This commit therefore uses a greedy algorithm to re-order the test
entries so that the sequential batching will produce an optimal schedule
in this case:

	----start batch----
	 TREE07 16
	 SRCU-P 8
	----start batch----
	 TREE08 16
	 TREE01 8
	----start batch----
	 TREE02 8
	 TREE03 8
	 TREE04 8
	----start batch----
	 TREE05 8
	 TREE06 8
	 SRCU-N 4
	 TINY01 1
	 TINY02 1
	 TREE09 1

Please note that this is still not an optimal bin-packing algorithm,
however, it does produce optimal solutions for most common scenarios.
