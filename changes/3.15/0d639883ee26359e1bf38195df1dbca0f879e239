drm: make minors independent of global lock

We used to protect minor-lookup and setup by the global drm lock. To
continue our attempts of dropping drm_global_mutex, this patch makes the
minor management independent of it. Furthermore, we make it all atomic and
switch to spin-locks instead of a mutex.

Now that minor-lookup is independent, we also move the
"drm_is_unplugged()" test into the minor-lookup path. There is no reason
to ever return a minor for unplugged objects, so keep that logic internal.
