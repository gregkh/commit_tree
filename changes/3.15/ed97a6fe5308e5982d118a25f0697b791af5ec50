[media] af9033: Don't export functions for the hardware filter

Exporting functions for hardware filter is a bad idea, as it
breaks compilation if:
	CONFIG_DVB_USB_AF9035=y
	CONFIG_DVB_AF9033=m

Because the PID filter function calls would be hardcoded at
af9035.

The same doesn't happen with af9033_attach() because the
dvb_attach() doesn't hardcode it. Instead, it dynamically
links it at runtime.

However, calling dvb_attach() multiple times is problematic,
as it increments module kref.

So, the better is to pass one parameter for the af9033 module
to fill the hardware filters, and then use it inside af9035.
