virtio_ccw: fix hang in set offline processing

During set offline processing virtio_grab_drvdata() incorrectly
calls dev_set_drvdata() to remove the virtio_ccw_device from the
parent ccw_device's driver data. This is wrong and ends up in a
hang during virtio_ccw_reset(), as the interrupt handler still
has need of the virtio_ccw_device.

A new field 'going_away' is introduced in struct virtio_ccw_device
to control the usage of the ccw_device's driver data pointer in
virtio_grab_drvdata().
