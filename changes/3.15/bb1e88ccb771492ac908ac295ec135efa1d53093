gpiolib: add gpiochip_get_desc() driver function

Some drivers dealing with a gpio_chip might need to act on its
descriptors directly; one example is pinctrl drivers that need to lock a
GPIO for being used as IRQ using gpiod_lock_as_irq().

This patch exports a gpiochip_get_desc() function that returns the
GPIO descriptor at the requested index. It also sweeps the
gpio_to_chip() function out of the consumer interface since any holder
of a gpio_chip reference can manipulate its GPIOs way beyond what a
consumer should be allowed to do.

As a result, gpio_chip is not visible anymore to simple GPIO consumers.
