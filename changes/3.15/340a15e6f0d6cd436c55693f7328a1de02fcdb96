spi: rspi: Merge qspi_send_pio() and qspi_receive_pio()

qspi_send_pio() and qspi_receive_pio() are very similar: they both send
and receive full duplex data to/from the hardware, but ignore the data
stream in the unused direction.
Merge them into qspi_transfer_out_in(), now supporting real full duplex.
