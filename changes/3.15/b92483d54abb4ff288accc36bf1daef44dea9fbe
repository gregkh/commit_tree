Bluetooth: Fix unsafe RFCOMM device parenting

Accessing the results of hci_conn_hash_lookup_ba() is unsafe without
holding the hci_dev_lock() during the lookup. For example:

CPU 0                             | CPU 1
hci_conn_hash_lookup_ba           | hci_conn_del
  rcu_read_lock                   |   hci_conn_hash_del
  list_for_each_entry_rcu         |     list_del_rcu
    if (.....)                    |       synchronize_rcu
      rcu_read_unlock             |
                                  |   hci_conn_del_sysfs
                                  |   hci_dev_put
                                  |   hci_conn_put
                                  |     put_device (last reference)
                                  |       bt_link_release
                                  |         kfree(conn)
      return p  << just freed     |

Even if a hci_conn reference were taken (via hci_conn_get), would
not guarantee the lifetime of the sysfs device, but only safe
access to the in-memory structure.

Ensure the hci_conn device stays valid while the rfcomm device
is reparented; rename rfcomm_get_device() to rfcomm_reparent_device()
and perform the reparenting within the function while holding the
hci_dev_lock.
