arm64: fixmap: fix missing sub-page offset for earlyprintk

Commit d57c33c5daa4 (add generic fixmap.h) added (among other
similar things) set_fixmap_io to deal with early ioremap of devices.

More recently, commit bf4b558eba92 (arm64: add early_ioremap support)
converted the arm64 earlyprintk to use set_fixmap_io. A side effect of
this conversion is that my virtual machines have stopped booting when
I pass "earlyprintk=uart8250-8bit,0x3f8" to the guest kernel.

Turns out that the new earlyprintk code doesn't care at all about
sub-page offsets, and just assumes that the earlyprintk device will
be page-aligned. Obviously, that doesn't play well with the above example.

Further investigation shows that set_fixmap_io uses __set_fixmap instead
of __set_fixmap_offset. A fix is to introduce a set_fixmap_offset_io that
uses the latter, and to remove the superflous call to fix_to_virt
(which only returns the value that set_fixmap_io has already given us).

With this applied, my VMs are back in business. Tested on a Cortex-A57
platform with kvmtool as platform emulation.
