ARM: shmobile: lager: Add VIN1 SoC camera support

This adds VIN1 SoC camera along with ADV7180 subdevice support to Lager.
VIN0 camera is not registered because it has ADV7612 I2C subdevice
which is not supported yet.

Changes in V2:
* made lager_add_vin_device function static.

Changes in V3:
* capitalized ARM in the subject.
