ARM: EXYNOS: Fix abuse of CONFIG_PM

CONFIG_PM means that at least one of CONFIG_PM_SLEEP and
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is enabled, while multiple entries in
mach-exynos/Kconfig abused it to enable sleep- and runtime-specific
functionality.

This patch fixes this abuse by replacing dependencies on CONFIG_PM with
appropriate dependencies on either CONFIG_PM_SLEEP or CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME,
whichever is appropriate.
