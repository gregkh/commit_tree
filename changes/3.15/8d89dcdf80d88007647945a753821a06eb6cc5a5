vti: don't allow to add the same tunnel twice

Before the patch, it was possible to add two times the same tunnel:
ip l a vti1 type vti remote 10.16.0.121 local 10.16.0.249 key 41
ip l a vti2 type vti remote 10.16.0.121 local 10.16.0.249 key 41

It was possible, because ip_tunnel_newlink() calls ip_tunnel_find() with the
argument dev->type, which was set only later (when calling ndo_init handler
in register_netdevice()). Let's set this type in the setup handler, which is
called before newlink handler.

Introduced by commit b9959fd3b0fa ("vti: switch to new ip tunnel code").
