Bluetooth: Fix wrong identity address during connection failures

When the connection attempt fails, the address information are not
provided in the HCI_LE_Connection_Complete event. So use the original
information from the connection to reconstruct the identity address.

This is important when a connection attempt has been made using the
identity address, but the cached resolvable random address has changed
in the meantime. The failure event needs to use the identity address
and not the resolvable random address.
