drm: Add support for multiple plane types (v2)

The DRM core currently only tracks "overlay"-style planes.  Start
refactoring the plane handling to allow other plane types (primary and
cursor) to also be placed on the DRM plane list.

v2: Add drm_for_each_legacy_plane() iterator to smooth transition
    of drivers with plane loops.
