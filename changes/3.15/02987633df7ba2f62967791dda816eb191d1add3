MIPS: Don't assume 64-bit FP registers for context switch

When saving or restoring scalar FP context we want to access the least
significant 64 bits of each FP register. When the FP registers are 64
bits wide that is trivially the start of the registers value in memory.
However when the FP registers are wider this equivalence will no longer
be true for big endian systems. Define a new set of offset macros for
the least significant 64 bits of each saved FP register within thread
context, and make use of them when saving and restoring scalar FP
context.
