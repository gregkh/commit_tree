spi: spidev: Restore all SPI mode flags on ioctl failure

In commit f477b7fb13df2b843997559ff34e87d054ba6538 ("spi: DUAL and QUAD
support"), spi_device.mode was enlarged from 8 to 16 bits.

However, the spidev code still only saved 8 bits of data. If a spidev
SPI_IOC_WR_MODE or SPI_IOC_WR_LSB_FIRST request failed, only the lower 8
bits of the SPI mode were restored, inadvertently clearing the upper 8
bits, possibly disabling Quad or Dual SPI transfers for the device.

Save up to 32 bits to fix this.

For SPI_IOC_WR_MODE this is probably not so important, as it doesn't allow
setting Quad or Dual mode anyway, but SPI_IOC_WR_LSB_FIRST is used to just
set or clear a single bit.
