cifs: fix the race in cifs_writev()

O_APPEND handling there hadn't been completely fixed by Pavel's
patch; it checks the right value, but it's racy - we can't really
do that until i_mutex has been taken.

Fix by switching to __generic_file_aio_write() (open-coding
generic_file_aio_write(), actually) and pulling mutex_lock() above
inode_size_read().
