powerpc/pseries: Update dynamic cache nodes for suspend/resume operation

pHyp can change cache nodes for suspend/resume operation. Currently the
device tree is updated by drmgr in userspace after all non boot CPUs are
enabled. Hence, we do not modify the cache list based on the latest cache
nodes. Also we do not remove cache entries for the primary CPU.

This patch removes the cache list for the boot CPU, updates the device tree
before enabling nonboot CPUs and adds cache list for the boot cpu.

This patch also has the side effect that older versions of drmgr will
perform a second device tree update from userspace. While this is a
redundant waste of a couple cycles it is harmless since firmware returns the
same data for the subsequent update-nodes/properties rtas calls.
