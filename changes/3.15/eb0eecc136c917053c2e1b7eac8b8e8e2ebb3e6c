be2net: Log a kernel message when UE is detected in BE & Skyhawk

This patch logs a kernel message when a HW error(SLIPORT_ERROR in Lancer and UE
in BEx/Skyhawk) is detected. The log message for BE3 was missing earlier.
This patch also refactors the code by segregating error-detection and reporting
code for Lancer and BEx/SH.
