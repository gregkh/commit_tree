Staging: comedi: addi-data: fix brace-related coding style issues in hwdrv_apci035.c

This patch for hwdrv_apci035 removes some unneeded braces, and moves some
improperly placed braces to the correct position, as found by checkpatch.
It also removes a commented out if-statement that I found whilst cleaning
braces that is identical to another un-commented if-statement directly
above it, so it is just added clutter and so we can delete it to clean up
further.
