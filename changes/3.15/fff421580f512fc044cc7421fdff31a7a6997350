timers: Track total number of timers in list

Currently, the tvec_base structure's ->active_timers field tracks only
the non-deferrable timers, which means that even if ->active_timers is
zero, there might well be deferrable timers in the list.  This commit
therefore adds an ->all_timers field to track all the timers, whether
deferrable or not.
