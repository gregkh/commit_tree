drm/omap: fix output enable/disable sequence

At the moment it's quite easy to get the following errors when the HDMI
output is enabled or disabled:

[drm:omap_crtc_error_irq] *ERROR* tv: errors: 00008000

The reason for the errors is that the omapdrm driver doesn't properly
handle the sync-lost irqs that happen when enabling the DIGIT crtc,
which is used for HDMI and analog TV. The driver does disable the
sync-lost irq properly, but it fails to wait until the output has been
fully enabled (i.e. the first vsync), so the sync-lost errors are still
seen occasionally.

This patch makes the omapdrm act the same way as the omapfb does:

- When enabling a display, we'll wait for the first vsync.
- When disabling a display, we'll wait for framedone if available, or
  odd and even vsyncs.

These changes make sure the output is fully enabled or disabled at the
end of the function.
