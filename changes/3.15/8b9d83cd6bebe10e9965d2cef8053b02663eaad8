Btrfs: fix early enospc due to the race of the two ordered extent wait

btrfs_wait_ordered_roots() moves all the list entries to a new list,
and then deals with them one by one. But if the other task invokes this
function at that time, it would get a empty list. It makes the enospc
error happens more early. Fix it.
