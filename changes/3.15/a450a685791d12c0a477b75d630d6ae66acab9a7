smc91x: improve definition of debug macros

Redefine some macros that were conditioned upon SMC_DEBUG level.

By allowing compiler to verify parameters used by these macros
unconditionally, we can flag compilation failures.

Compiler will still optimize out the unused code path depending on
SMC_DEBUG, so this is a net gain.
