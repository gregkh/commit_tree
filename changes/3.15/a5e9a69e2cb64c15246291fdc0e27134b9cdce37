MIPS: Detect the MSA ASE

This patch adds support for probing the MSAP bit within the Config3
register in order to detect the presence of the MSA ASE. Presence of the
ASE will be indicated in /proc/cpuinfo. The value of the MSA
implementation register will be displayed at boot to aid debugging and
verification of a correct setup, as is done for the FPU.
