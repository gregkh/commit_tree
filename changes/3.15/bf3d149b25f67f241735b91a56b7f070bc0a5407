drm/i915: split PIN_GLOBAL out from PIN_MAPPABLE

With abitrary pin flags it makes sense to split out a "please bind
this into global gtt" from the "please allocate in the mappable
range".

Use this unconditionally in our global gtt pin helper since this is
what its callers want. Later patches will drop PIN_MAPPABLE where it's
not strictly needed.
