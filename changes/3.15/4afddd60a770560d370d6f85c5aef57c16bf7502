kernfs: protect lazy kernfs_iattrs allocation with mutex

kernfs_iattrs is allocated lazily when operations which require it
take place; unfortunately, the lazy allocation and returning weren't
properly synchronized and when there are multiple concurrent
operations, it might end up returning kernfs_iattrs which hasn't
finished initialization yet or different copies to different callers.

Fix it by synchronizing with a mutex.  This can be smarter with memory
barriers but let's go there if it actually turns out to be necessary.
