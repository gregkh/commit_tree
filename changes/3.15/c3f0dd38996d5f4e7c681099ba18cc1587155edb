net: mvneta: use devm_ioremap_resource() instead of of_iomap()

The mvneta driver currently uses of_iomap(), which has two drawbacks:
it doesn't request the resource, and it isn't devm-style so some error
handling is needed.

This commit switches to use devm_ioremap_resource() instead, which
automatically requests the resource (so the I/O registers region shows
up properly in /proc/iomem), and also is devm-style, which allows to
get rid of some error handling to unmap the I/O registers region.
