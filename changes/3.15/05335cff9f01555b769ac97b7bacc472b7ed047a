bcache: Fix a race when freeing btree nodes

This isn't a bulletproof fix; btree_node_free() -> bch_bucket_free() puts the
bucket on the unused freelist, where it can be reused right away without any
ordering requirements. It would be better to wait on at least a journal write to
go down before reusing the bucket. bch_btree_set_root() does this, and inserting
into non leaf nodes is completely synchronous so we should be ok, but future
patches are just going to get rid of the unused freelist - it was needed in the
past for various reasons but shouldn't be anymore.
