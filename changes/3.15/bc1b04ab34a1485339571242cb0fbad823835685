RDMA/ocrdma: Fix compiler warning

drivers/infiniband/hw/ocrdma/ocrdma_verbs.c: In function ‘_ocrdma_modify_qp’:
drivers/infiniband/hw/ocrdma/ocrdma_verbs.c:1299:31: error: ‘old_qps’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
  status = ocrdma_mbx_modify_qp(dev, qp, attr, attr_mask, old_qps);

ocrdma_mbx_modify_qp() (and subsequent calls) doesn't appear to use old_qps
so it doesn't need to be passed on.  Removing the variable results in the
warning going away.
