watchdog: Simplify a little the IPI call

In order to remotely restart the watchdog hrtimer, update_timers()
allocates a csd on the stack and pass it to __smp_call_function_single().

There is no partcular need, however, for a specific csd here. Lets
simplify that a little by calling smp_call_function_single()
which can already take care of the csd allocation by itself.
