[SCSI] libiscsi: Restructure iscsi_tcp r2t response logic

Restructure the iscsi_tcp_r2t_rsp routine in order to avoid allocating
r2t from r2tpool.queue and returning it back in case the parameters
rhdr->data_length and or rhdr->data_offset prohibit the requing.

Since the values of these parameters are known prior to the allocation,
we can pre-check and thus avoid futile allocations.
