xen-netback: Functional follow-up patch for grant mapping series

Ian made some late comments about the grant mapping series, I incorporated the
functional outcomes into this patch:

- use callback_param macro to shorten access to pending_tx_info in
  xenvif_fill_frags() and xenvif_tx_submit()
- print an error message in xenvif_idx_unmap() before panic
