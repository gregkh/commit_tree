ath10k: AP mode, set UAPSD params correctly

ath10k handles UAPSD completly in the firmware.
When works in AP mode we have to configure
UAPSD params for each station. Without this
patch we configure UAPSD params before we
send peer assoc command to the FW, which was
wrong. Next FW didn't know what should be trigger
frame, couse UAPSD didn't work correctly in AP mode.
To configure UAPSD params correctly we have to
send them after peer assoc command.
