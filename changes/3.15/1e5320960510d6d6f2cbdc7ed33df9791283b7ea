s390/cio: reorder initialization of ccw consoles

Drivers for ccw consoles use ccw_device_probe_console to receive
an initialized ccw device which is already enabled for interrupts.
After that the device driver does the initialization of its private
data. This can race with unsolicited interrupts which can happen
once the device is enabled for interrupts.

Split ccw_device_probe_console into ccw_device_create_console and
ccw_device_enable_console and reorder the initialization of the ccw
console drivers.

While at it mark these functions as __init.
