Revert irqchip: irq-dove: Add PMU interrupt controller

This reverts commit 40b367d95fb3d60fc1edb9ba8f6ef52272e48936.

Russell King has raised the idea of creating a proper PMU driver for
this SoC that would incorporate the functionality currently in this
driver. It would also cover the use case for the graphics subsystem on
this SoC.

To prevent having to maintain the devicetree ABI for this limited
interrupt-handler driver, we revert the driver before it hits a mainline
tagged release (eg v3.15).
