ASoC: fsl_esai: Fix incorrect condition within ratio range check for FP

The range here from 1 to 16 is confined to FP divider only while the
sck_div indicates if the calculation contains PSR and PM dividers. So
for the case using PSR and PM since the sck_div is true, the range of
ratio would simply become bigger than 16.

So this patch fixes the condition here and adds one line comments to
make the purpose here clear.
