target: Enable WRITE_INSERT emulation in target_execute_cmd

This patch enables WRITE_INSERT emulation in target_execute_cmd()
in order to locally generate DIF PI before submitting the WRITE
to the underlying backend device.

This is required for fabric drivers that currently don't support
DIF over-the-wire, in order to inact with backend devices that
have hardware (IBLOCK) or software (FILEIO + RAMDISK) support
for handling T10 PI.

v2 changes:
   - Convert to sbc_dif_generate() usage (Sagi)
