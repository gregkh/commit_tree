Bluetooth: Make LTK and CSRK only persisent when bonding

In case the pairable option has been disabled, the pairing procedure
does not create keys for bonding. This means that these generated keys
should not be stored persistently.

For LTK and CSRK this is important to tell userspace to not store these
new keys. They will be available for the lifetime of the device, but
after the next power cycle they should not be used anymore.

Inform userspace to actually store the keys persistently only if both
sides request bonding.
