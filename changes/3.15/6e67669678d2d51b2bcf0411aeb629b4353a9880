documentation: Document call_rcu() safety mechanisms and limitations

The call_rcu() family of primitives will take action to accelerate
grace periods when the number of callbacks pending on a given CPU
becomes excessive.  Although this safety mechanism can be useful,
it is no substitute for users of call_rcu() having rate-limit controls
in place.  This commit adds this nuance to the documentation.
