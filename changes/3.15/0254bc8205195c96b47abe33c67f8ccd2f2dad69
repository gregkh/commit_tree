net/mlx4_core: Fix slave id computation for single port VF

The code that deals with computing the slave id based on a given GID
gave wrong results when the number of single port VFs wasn't the
same for port 1 vs. port 2 and the relevant VF is single ported on
port 2. As a result, incoming CM MADs were dispatched to the wrong VF.
Fixed that and added documentation to clarify the computation steps.
