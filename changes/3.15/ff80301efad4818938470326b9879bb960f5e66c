i40e: fix nvm version and remove firmware report

The driver needs to use the format that the current NVM
uses when printing the version of the NVM.  It should remain
this way from now on forward.

The driver was reporting when firmware was less than
an expected version number, but this is not a requirement
for the product and we print the firmware number at
init and in ethtool -i output.  Just remove the print.
