rtc: pxa: drop unused #define TIMER_FREQ

It seems this symbol was unused since the driver was introduced in
commit dc94436 (rtc: driver for pxa27x and pxa3xx SoC) back in 2009.

As a by-product this patch makes the driver stop "using" the symbol
CLOCK_TICK_RATE which is about to be removed very soon (for ARM).
