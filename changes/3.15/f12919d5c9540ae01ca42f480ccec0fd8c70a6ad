Staging: rtl8188eu: Fix warning of unchecked sscanf return value.

This patch fixes the warning "unchecked sscanf return value" in file
rtw_mp.c. Zero is returned in case sscanf fails or if less than expected
items are read and assigned successfully. I have decided to return zero,
because in previous conditional statements zero was returned in case of
failure.

While at it, I have also fixed the warning of line over 80
characters.
