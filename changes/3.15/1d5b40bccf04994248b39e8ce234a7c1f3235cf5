regmap: Add bypassed version of regmap_multi_reg_write

Devices with more complex boot proceedures may occasionally apply the
register patch manual. regmap_multi_reg_write is a logical way to do so,
however the patch must be applied with cache bypass on, such that it
doesn't override any user settings. This patch adds a
regmap_multi_reg_write_bypassed function that applies a set of writes
with the bypass enabled.
