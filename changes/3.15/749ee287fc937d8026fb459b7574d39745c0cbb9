ALSA: hda - Add jackpoll_ms to struct azx

Keeping a pointer to the jackpoll_ms array in the chip will allow
azx_codec_create to be shared between hda_intel and hda_platform
drivers.  Also modify get_jackpoll_ms to make the jackpoll_ms member
optional, this way a platform driver can leave it out if it's not
needed.
