tty: Set correct tty name in 'active' sysfs attribute

The 'active' sysfs attribute should refer to the currently active tty
devices the console is running on, not the currently active console. The
console structure doesn't refer to any device in sysfs, only the tty the
console is running on has. So we need to print out the tty names in
'active', not the console names.

There is one special-case, which is tty0. If the console is directed to
it, we want 'tty0' to show up in the file, so user-space knows that the
messages get forwarded to the active VT. The ->device() callback would
resolve tty0, though. Hence, treat it special and don't call into the VT
layer to resolve it (plymouth is known to depend on it).
