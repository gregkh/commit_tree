spi: sunxi: Add Allwinner A10 SPI controller driver

The older Allwinner SoCs (A10, A13, A10s and A20) all have the same SPI
controller.

Unfortunately, this SPI controller, even though quite similar, is significantly
different from the recently supported A31 SPI controller (different registers
offset, split/merged registers, etc.). Supporting both controllers in a single
driver would be unreasonable, hence the addition of a new driver.

Like its more recent counterpart, it supports DMA, but the driver only does PIO
until we have a dmaengine driver for this platform.
