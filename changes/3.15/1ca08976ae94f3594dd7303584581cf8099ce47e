btrfs: Add high priority workqueue support for btrfs_workqueue_struct

Add high priority function to btrfs_workqueue.

This is implemented by embedding a btrfs_workqueue into a
btrfs_workqueue and use some helper functions to differ the normal
priority wq and high priority wq.
So the high priority wq is completely independent from the normal
workqueue.
