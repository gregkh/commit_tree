ALSA: hda - Enable sysfs attributes without CONFIG_SND_HDA_RECONFIG

Some sysfs attributes like init_pin_configs or vendor_name are really
basic and should be available no matter whether the codec driver is
re-configurable or not.  Put them out of #ifdef
CONFIG_SND_HDA_RECONFIG and allow the read-only accesses.
