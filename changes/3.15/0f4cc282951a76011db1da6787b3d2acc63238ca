regulator: s2mps11: Fix section mismatch

Remove __initconst from regulator_desc array because this array is used
during probe and s2mps11_pmic_probe() is not in __init section. However
still select the number of supported regulators according to device ID
so the driver will be ready for adding support for S2MPS14 device.
