ACPICA: Enable auto-serialization as a default kernel behavior.

The previous commit "ACPICA: Add auto-serialization support for ill-behaved
control methods" introduced the auto-serialization facility as a workaround
that can be enabled by "acpi_auto_serialize":

This feature marks control methods that create named objects as "serialized"
to avoid unwanted AE_ALREADY_EXISTS control method evaluation failures.

Enable method auto-serialization as the default kernel behavior.  The new kernel
parameter is also changed from "acpi_auto_serialize" to "acpi_no_auto_serialize"
to reflect the default behavior.
