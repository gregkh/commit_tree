usb: wusbcore: don't mark WA_SEG_DTI_PENDING segs as done in urb_dequeue

Data for transfer segments in the WA_SEG_DTI_PENDING state is actively
being read by the driver.  Let the buffer read callback handle the
transfer cleanup since cleaning it up in wa_urb_dequeue will cause the
read callback to access invalid memory if the transfer is completed.
