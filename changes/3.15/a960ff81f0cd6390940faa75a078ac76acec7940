neigh: probe application via netlink in NUD_PROBE

iproute2 arpd seems to expect this as there's code and comments
to handle netlink probes with NUD_PROBE set. It is used to flush
the arpd cached mappings.

opennhrp instead turns off unicast probes (so it can handle all
neighbour discovery). Without this change it will not see NUD_PROBE
probes and cannot reconfirm the mapping. Thus currently neigh entry
will just fail and can cause few packets dropped until broadcast
discovery is restarted.
