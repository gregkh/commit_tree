Staging: unisys: Cleanup macros to get rid of goto statements

Remove the following macros:
	TRY
	CHKFD
	CHKDD
	CHKFDX
	CHKDDX
	ADDPROCLINE
	TRY_WPOSTCODE_1
	TRY_WPOSTCODE_2
	FAIL_WPOSTCODE_2
	FAIL_WPOSTCODE_3

Part of a series to get rid of goto statements embedded in macros.  I'm
breaking this up into a series of smaller patches for easier review.  The later
patches in the series will actually remove the goto statements.
