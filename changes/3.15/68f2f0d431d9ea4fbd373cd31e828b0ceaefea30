powerpc: Add a cpu feature CPU_FTR_PMAO_BUG

Some power8 revisions have a hardware bug where we can lose a
Performance Monitor (PMU) exception under certain circumstances.

We will be adding a workaround for this case, see the next commit for
details. The observed behaviour is that writing PMAO doesn't cause an
exception as we would expect, hence the name of the feature.
