clocksource/cadence_ttc: Overhaul clocksource frequency adjustment

The currently used method adjusting the clocksource to a changing input
frequency does not work on kernels from 3.11 on.
The new approach is to keep the timer frequency as constant as possible.
I.e.
 - due to the TTC's prescaler limitations, allow frequency changes
   only if the frequency scales by a power of 2
 - adjust the counter's divider on the fly when a frequency change
   occurs

This limits cpufreq to scale by certain factors only.
But we may keep the time base somewhat constant, so that sleep() & co
keep working as expected, while supporting cpufreq.
