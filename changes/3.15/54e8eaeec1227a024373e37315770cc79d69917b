ARM: dts: imx: drop invalid size and address cells properties

Those two properties should have been set to zero, which
is the same as not specifying them.

Having address-cells set to 1 causes OF interrupt
mapping routines to add 1 to the interrupt-cells
property and as result fail because all calculations
are off by one.
