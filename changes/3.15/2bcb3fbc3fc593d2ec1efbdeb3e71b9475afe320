MIPS: Dumb MSA FP exception handler

This patch adds a simple handler for MSA FP exceptions which delivers a
SIGFPE to the running task. In the future it should probably be extended
to re-execute the instruction with the MSACSR.NX bit set in order to
generate results for any elements which did not cause an exception
before delivering the SIGFPE signal.
