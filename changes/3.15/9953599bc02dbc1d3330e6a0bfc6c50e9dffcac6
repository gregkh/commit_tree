drm/i915: Don't check gmch state on inherited configs

... our current modeset code isn't good enough yet to handle this. The
scenario is:

1. BIOS sets up a cloned config with lvds+external screen on the same
pipe, e.g. pipe B.

2. We read out that state for pipe B and assign the gmch_pfit state to
it.

3. The initial modeset switches the lvds to pipe A but due to lack of
atomic modeset we don't recompute the config of pipe B.

-> both pipes now claim (in the sw pipe config structure) to use the
gmch_pfit, which just won't work.
