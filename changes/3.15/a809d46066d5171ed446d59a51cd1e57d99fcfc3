MIPS: Fix gigaton of warning building with microMIPS.

With binutils 2.24 the attempt to switch with microMIPS mode to MIPS III
mode through .set mips3 results in *lots* of warnings like

{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:397: Warning: the 64-bit MIPS architecture does not support the `smartmips' extension

during a kernel build.  Fixed by using .set arch=r4000 instead.

This breaks support for building the kernel with binutils 2.13 which
was supported for 32 bit kernels only anyway and 2.14 which was a bad
vintage for MIPS anyway.
