lustre/libcfs: warn if all HTs in a core are gone

libcfs cpu partition can't support CPU hotplug, but it is safe
when plug-in new CPU or enabling/disabling hyper-threading.
It has potential risk only if plug-out CPU because it may break CPU
affinity of Lustre threads.

Current libcfs will print warning for all CPU notification, this
patch changed this behavior and only output warning when we lost all
HTs in a CPU core which may have broken affinity of Lustre threads.
