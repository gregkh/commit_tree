x86, reboot: Only use CF9_COND automatically, not CF9

Only CF9_COND is appropriate for inclusion in the default chain, not
CF9; the latter will poke that register unconditionally, whereas
CF9_COND will at least look for PCI configuration method #1 or #2
first (a weak check, but better than nothing.)

CF9 should be used for explicit system configuration (command line or
DMI) only.
