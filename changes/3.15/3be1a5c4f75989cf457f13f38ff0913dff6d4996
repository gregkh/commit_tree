arm64: enable generic CPU feature modalias matching for this architecture

This enables support for the generic CPU feature modalias implementation that
wires up optional CPU features to udev based module autoprobing.

A file <asm/cpufeature.h> is provided that maps CPU feature numbers to
elf_hwcap bits, which is the standard way on arm64 to advertise optional CPU
features both internally and to user space.
