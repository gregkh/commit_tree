drivers: block: Mark functions as static in drbd_req.c

Mark functions drbd_request_prepare() and find_oldest_request() as
static in drbd/drbd_req.c because they are not used outside this file.

This eliminates the following warnings in drbd/drbd_req.c:
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_req.c:1037:1: warning: no previous prototype for ‘drbd_request_prepare’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_req.c:1323:22: warning: no previous prototype for ‘find_oldest_request’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
