rcutorture: Abstract torture_shuffle()

The torture_shuffle() function forces each CPU in turn to go idle
periodically in order to check for problems interacting with per-CPU
variables and with dyntick-idle mode.  Because this sort of debugging
is not specific to RCU, this commit abstracts that functionality.
This in turn requires abstracting some additional infrastructure.
