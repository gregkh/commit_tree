ip6_gre: don't allow to remove the fb_tunnel_dev

It's possible to remove the FB tunnel with the command 'ip link del ip6gre0' but
this is unsafe, the module always supposes that this device exists. For example,
ip6gre_tunnel_lookup() may use it unconditionally.

Let's add a rtnl handler for dellink, which will never remove the FB tunnel (we
let ip6gre_destroy_tunnels() do the job).

Introduced by commit c12b395a4664 ("gre: Support GRE over IPv6").
