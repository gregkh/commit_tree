cgroup: update cgroup name handling

Straightforward updates to cgroup name handling in preparation of
kernfs conversion.

* cgroup_alloc_name() is updated to take const char * isntead of
  dentry * for name source.

* cgroup name formatting is separated out into cgroup_file_name().
  While at it, buffer length protection is added.
