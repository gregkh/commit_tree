ARM/serial: at91: switch atmel serial to use gpiolib

This passes the errata fix using a GPIO to control the RTS pin
on one of the AT91 chips to use gpiolib instead of the
AT91-specific interfaces. Also remove the reliance on
compile-time #defines and the cpu_* check and rely on the
platform passing down the proper GPIO pin through platform
data.

This is a prerequisite for getting rid of the local GPIO
implementation in the AT91 platform and move toward
multiplatform.

The patch also adds device tree support for getting the
RTS GPIO pin from the device tree on DT boot paths.
