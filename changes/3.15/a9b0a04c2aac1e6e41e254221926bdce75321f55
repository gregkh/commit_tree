Bluetooth: Connection parameters and resolvable address

We should only accept connection parameters from identity addresses
(public or random static). Thus, we should check the address type
in hci_conn_params_add().

Additionally, since the IRK is removed during unpair, we should also
remove the connection parameters from that device.
