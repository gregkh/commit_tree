i2c: qup: New bus driver for the Qualcomm QUP I2C controller

This bus driver supports the QUP i2c hardware controller in the Qualcomm SOCs.
The Qualcomm Universal Peripheral Engine (QUP) is a general purpose data path
engine with input/output FIFOs and an embedded i2c mini-core. The driver
supports FIFO mode (for low bandwidth applications) and block mode (interrupt
generated for each block-size data transfer).
