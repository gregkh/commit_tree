wil6210: add scatter-gather support

When setting fragmented skb for Tx, assign skb to the last descriptor
and set number of fragments in the 1-st one
On Tx complete, HW sets "DU" bit in Tx descriptor only for the last
descriptor; so search for it using number of fragments field.
Middle descriptors may have "DU" bit not set by the hardware.
