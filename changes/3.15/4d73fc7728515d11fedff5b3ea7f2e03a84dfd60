pinctrl: mvebu: dove: request additional resources

Dove pinctrl also requires additional registers to control all pins.
This patch requests resources for mpp4 and pmu-mpp register ranges.
As this changes DT to driver requirements, fallback to hardcoded
resources, if the corresponding DT regs have not been set.
Also, WARN about old DT binding usage to encourage users to update
their DTBs.
