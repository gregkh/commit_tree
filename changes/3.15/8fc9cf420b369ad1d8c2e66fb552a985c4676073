slab: make more slab management structure off the slab

Now, the size of the freelist for the slab management diminish,
so that the on-slab management structure can waste large space
if the object of the slab is large.

Consider a 128 byte sized slab. If on-slab is used, 31 objects can be
in the slab. The size of the freelist for this case would be 31 bytes
so that 97 bytes, that is, more than 75% of object size, are wasted.

In a 64 byte sized slab case, no space is wasted if we use on-slab.
So set off-slab determining constraint to 128 bytes.
