xen-netback: Fix grant ref resolution in RX path

The original series for reintroducing grant mapping for netback had a patch [1]
to handle receiving of packets from an another VIF. Grant copy on the receiving
side needs the grant ref of the page to set up the op.
The original patch assumed (wrongly) that the frags array haven't changed. In
the case reported by Sander, the sending guest sent a packet where the linear
buffer and the first frag were under PKT_PROT_LEN (=128) bytes.
xenvif_tx_submit() then pulled up the linear area to 128 bytes, and ditched the
first frag. The receiving side had an off-by-one problem when gathered the grant
refs.
This patch fixes that by checking whether the actual frag's page pointer is the
same as the page in the original frag list. It can handle any kind of changes on
the original frags array, like:
- removing granted frags from the array at any point
- adding local pages to the frags list anywhere
- reordering the frags
It's optimized to the most common case, when there is 1:1 relation between the
frags and the list, plus works optimal when frags are removed from the end or
the beginning.
