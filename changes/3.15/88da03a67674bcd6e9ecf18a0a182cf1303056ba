slub: use raw_cpu_inc for incrementing statistics

Statistics are not critical to the operation of the allocation but
should also not cause too much overhead.

When __this_cpu_inc is altered to check if preemption is disabled this
triggers.  Use raw_cpu_inc to avoid the checks.  Using this_cpu_ops may
cause interrupt disable/enable sequences on various arches which may
significantly impact allocator performance.
