staging: comedi: pcl818: clarify dma channel request in pcl818_attach()

All the board types that can do DMA can use DMA channels 3 or 1. Remove
the 'DMAbits', which is a mask of the valid channels, from the boardinfo
and replace it with a bit-field flag 'has_dma'.

Refactor pcl818_attach() to use the new flag and remove the need for the
goto.
