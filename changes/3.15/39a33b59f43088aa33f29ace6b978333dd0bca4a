powerpc/pseries: Device tree should only be updated once after suspend/migrate

The current code makes rtas calls for update-nodes, activate-firmware and then
update-nodes again. The FW provides the same data for both update-nodes calls.
As a result a proc entry exists error is reported for the second update while
adding device nodes.

This patch makes a single rtas call for update-nodes after activating the FW.
It also add rtas_busy delay for the activate-firmware rtas call.
