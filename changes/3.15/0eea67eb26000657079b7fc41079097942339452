drm/i915: Create a per file_priv default context

Every file will get it's own context, and we use this context instead of
the default context. The default context still exists for future
shrinker usage as well as reset handling.

v2: Updated to address Mika's recent context guilty changes
Some more changes around this come up in later patches as well.

v3: Use a fake context to avoid allocation for the !HAS_HW_CONTEXT case.
I've tried the alternatives. This looks the best to me.
Removed hangstat stuff from v2 - for a separate patch
Demote failed PPGTT set to DRM_DEBUG_DRIVER since it can now be invoked
easily from userspace.
