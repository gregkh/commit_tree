drm/i915: Don't access snooped pages through the GTT (even for error capture)

to access snoopable pages through the GTT and causes my PineView GPU to
throw a page fault instead.

This has not been a problem in the past as we only dumped ringbuffers
and batchbuffers, both of which must be not snooped. However, the
introduction of HWS page dumping leads to a read of a snooped object
through the GTT. This was introduced by
