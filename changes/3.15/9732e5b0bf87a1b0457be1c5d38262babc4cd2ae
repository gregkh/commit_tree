Input: sirfsoc-onkey - set the capability of reporting KEY_POWER

commit a1a7521064428fc1cf8 moved to report EV_KEY event(KEY_POWER) instead of
reporting EV_PWR event(KEY_SUSPEND), but it didn't enable the capability, so
the KEY_POWER will not be reported to userspace by input core. this patch fixes
the issue.
