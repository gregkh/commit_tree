mm/process_vm_access.c: mark function as static

Mark function as static in process_vm_access.c because it is not used
outside this file.

This eliminates the following warning in mm/process_vm_access.c:

  mm/process_vm_access.c:416:1: warning: no previous prototype for `compat_process_vm_rw' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: remove unneeded asmlinkage - compat_process_vm_rw isn't referenced from asm]
