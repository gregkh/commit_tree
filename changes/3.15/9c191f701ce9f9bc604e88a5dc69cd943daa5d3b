ext4: each filesystem creates and uses its own mb_cache

This patch adds new interfaces to create and destory cache,
ext4_xattr_create_cache() and ext4_xattr_destroy_cache(), and remove
the cache creation and destory calls from ex4_init_xattr() and
ext4_exitxattr() in fs/ext4/xattr.c.

fs/ext4/super.c has been changed so that when a filesystem is mounted
a cache is allocated and attched to its ext4_sb_info structure.

fs/mbcache.c has been changed so that only one slab allocator is
allocated and used by all mbcache structures.
