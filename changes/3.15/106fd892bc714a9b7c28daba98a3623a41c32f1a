swim3: fix interruptible_sleep_on race

interruptible_sleep_on is racy and going away. This replaces the one
caller in the swim3 driver with the equivalent race-free
wait_event_interruptible call. Since we're here already, this
also fixes the case where we get interrupted from atomic context,
which used to just spin in the loop.
