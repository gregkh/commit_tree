mfd: dbx500/abx500: root out hardcoded IRQ assignments

The DBx500 and ABx500 should be getting their IRQs from the
device tree and nowhere else. Get rid of all the static assignments
everywhere, delete it from the driver, platform data and the
board files in one swift strike.

Lots of cross-dependencies in the MFD drivers for PRCMU and
AB8500 makes it necessary to strike everywhere at once to
eradicate IRQs passed as resources and platform data to the left
and right around the platform.
