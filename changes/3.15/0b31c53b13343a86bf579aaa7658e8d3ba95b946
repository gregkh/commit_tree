ARM: omap1: don't rely on tps65010

The code for h2 and osk implicitly assumes that the tps65010
driver is built-in, in order to perform the initial regulator
setup.

This is fine for most real uses, but it does get into the way
of build testing with 'make randconfig', since we don't want
platforms to implicitly select device drivers and subsystems
such as I2C.

This patch by contrast changes the board files to not call
into the tps65010 driver when that is not built-in, allowing
us to build all configurations including some that will not
work properly on this hardware.
