hwmon: (emc1403) Support full range of known chip revision numbers

The datasheet for EMC1413/EMC1414, which is fully compatible to
EMC1403/1404 and uses the same chip identification, references revision
numbers 0x01, 0x03, and 0x04. Accept the full range of revision numbers
from 0x01 to 0x04 to make sure none are missed.
