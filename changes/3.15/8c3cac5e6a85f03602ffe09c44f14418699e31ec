locks: eliminate BUG() call when there's an unexpected lock on file close

A leftover lock on the list is surely a sign of a problem of some sort,
but it's not necessarily a reason to panic the box. Instead, just log a
warning with some info about the lock, and then delete it like we would
any other lock.

In the event that the filesystem declares a ->lock f_op, we may end up
leaking something, but that's generally preferable to an immediate
panic.
