intel_pstate: Correct rounding in busy calculation

Changing to fixed point math throughout the busy calculation in
commit e66c1768 (Change busy calculation to use fixed point
math.) Introduced some inaccuracies by rounding the busy value at two
points in the calculation.  This change removes roundings and moves
the rounding to the output of the PID where the calculations are
complete and the value returned as an integer.

Fixes: e66c17683746 (intel_pstate: Change busy calculation to use fixed point math.)
