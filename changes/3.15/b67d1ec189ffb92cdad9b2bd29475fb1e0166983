zram: delete zram_init_device()

allocate new `zram_meta' in disksize_store() only for uninitialised zram
device, saving a number of allocations and deallocations in case if
disksize_store() was called on currently used device.  at the same time
zram_meta stack variable is not necessary, because we can set ->meta
directly.  there is also no need in setting QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT queue on
every disksize_store(), set it once during device creation.
