staging:nokia_h4p:Replace __attribute__((packed)) by __packed

This patch fixes the checkpatch.pl warning:
WARNING: __packed is preferred over __attribute__((packed)).
As the macro: #define __packed __attribute__((packed)) is defined
in compiler-gcc.h, __attribute__((packed)) is replaced by __packed.
