sfc: fix calling of free_irq with already free vector

If the sfc driver is in legacy interrupt mode (either explicitly by
using interrupt_mode module param or by falling back to it) it will
hit a warning at kernel/irq/manage.c because it will try to free an irq
which wasn't allocated by it in the first place because the MSI(X) irqs are
zero and it'll try to free them unconditionally. So fix it by checking if
we're in legacy mode and freeing the appropriate irqs.
