bcache: Fix moving_gc deadlocking with a foreground write

Deadlock happened because a foreground write slept, waiting for a bucket
to be allocated. Normally the gc would mark buckets available for invalidation.
But the moving_gc was stuck waiting for outstanding writes to complete.
These writes used the bcache_wq, the same queue foreground writes used.

This fix gives moving_gc its own work queue, so it was still finish moving
even if foreground writes are stuck waiting for allocation. It also makes
work queue a parameter to the data_insert path, so moving_gc can use its
workqueue for writes.
