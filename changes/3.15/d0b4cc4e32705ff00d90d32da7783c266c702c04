PCI: Wrong register used to check pending traffic

The incorrect register offset is passed to pci_wait_for_pending(), which is
caused by commit 157e876ffe ("PCI: Add pci_wait_for_pending() (refactor
pci_wait_for_pending_transaction())").

Fixes: 157e876ffe ("PCI: Add pci_wait_for_pending() (refactor pci_wait_for_pending_transaction())
