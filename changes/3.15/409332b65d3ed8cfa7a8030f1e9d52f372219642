fs: Introduce FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE flag for fallocate

Introduce new FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE flag for fallocate. This has the same
functionality as xfs ioctl XFS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE.

It can be used to convert a range of file to zeros preferably without
issuing data IO. Blocks should be preallocated for the regions that span
holes in the file, and the entire range is preferable converted to
unwritten extents - even though file system may choose to zero out the
extent or do whatever which will result in reading zeros from the range
while the range remains allocated for the file.

This can be also used to preallocate blocks past EOF in the same way as
with fallocate. Flag FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE which should cause the inode
size to remain the same.
