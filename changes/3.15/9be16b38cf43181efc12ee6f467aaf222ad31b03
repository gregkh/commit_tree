serial: sirf: move to use generic dma dt-binding to get dma channels

instead of using sirf specific dma channel property like "sirf,uart-dma-rx-channel"
and "sirf,uart-dma-tx-channel", here we move to use generic dma dt-binding to get
the channel like:
- sirf,uart-dma-rx-channel = <21>;
- sirf,uart-dma-tx-channel = <2>;
+ dmas = <&dmac1 5>, <&dmac0 2>;
+ dma-names = "rx", "tx";

and we move dma_request_channel() to dma_request_slave_channel(), we don't need to
call sirfsoc dma filter function sirfsoc_dma_filter_id() again.
