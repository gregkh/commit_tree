serial: 8250: Clean up the locking for -rt

In -RT the spin_lock_irqsave() does not spin but sleep if the lock is
taken. Before that, local_irq_save() is invoked which disables
interrupts even on -RT. Therefore local_irq_save() + spin_lock() does not
work.
In the ->sysrq and oops_in_progress case it is save to trylock the lock
i.e. this is what we do now anyway except for ->sysrq where we assume
that the lock is already taken.

The spin_lock_irqsave() grabs the lock and disables the interrupts on
vanilla (the same behavior) and on -RT it won't disable interrupts.
