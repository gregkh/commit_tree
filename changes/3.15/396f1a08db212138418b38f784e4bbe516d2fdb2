x86/efi: Fix boot failure with EFI stub

commit 54b52d872680 ("x86/efi: Build our own EFI services pointer
table") introduced a regression because the 64-bit file_size()
implementation passed a pointer to a 32-bit data object, instead of a
pointer to a 64-bit object.

Because the firmware treats the object as 64-bits regardless it was
reading random values from the stack for the upper 32-bits.

This resulted in people being unable to boot their machines, after
seeing the following error messages,

    Failed to get file info size
    Failed to alloc highmem for files
