spider_net: Call dev_consume_skb_any instead of dev_kfree_skb.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in
spider_net_release_tx_chain which can be called in hard irq and other
contexts.

dev_consume_skb_any was choosen as it preserves the current
dev_kfree_skb semantics (dev_kfree_skb is consume_skb) and
is because it is correct most of the time as most packets
will have been successfully transmitted not dropeed.
