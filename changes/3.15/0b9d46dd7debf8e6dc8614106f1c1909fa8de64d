ACPI / processor: do not mark present at boot but not onlined CPU as onlined

acpi_processor_add() assumes that present at boot CPUs
are always onlined, it is not so if a CPU failed to become
onlined. As result acpi_processor_add() will mark such CPU
device as onlined in sysfs and following attempts to
online/offline it using /sys/device/system/cpu/cpuX/online
attribute will fail.

Do not poke into device internals in acpi_processor_add()
and touch "struct device { .offline }" attribute, since
for CPUs onlined at boot it's set by:
  topology_init() -> arch_register_cpu() -> register_cpu()
before ACPI device tree is parsed, and for hotplugged
CPUs it's set when userspace onlines CPU via sysfs.
