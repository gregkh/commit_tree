s390/irq: Use defines for external interruption codes

Use the new defines for external interruption codes to get rid
of "magic" numbers in the s390 source code. And while we're at it,
also rename the (un-)register_external_interrupt function to
something shorter so that this patch does not exceed the 80
columns all over the place.
