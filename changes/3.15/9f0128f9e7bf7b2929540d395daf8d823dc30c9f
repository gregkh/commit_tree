s390/sclp: add timeout for queued requests

This patch adds a timeout option for queued requests and introduces
sclp_sync_request_timeout() to use this timer. With this, blocking the
system too long, e.g. during an SE reboot, can be avoided in critical
situations like CPU and memory hotplug.
Since there is no way to cancel a running request, this timeout only
applies to queued requests that have not yet been started.
