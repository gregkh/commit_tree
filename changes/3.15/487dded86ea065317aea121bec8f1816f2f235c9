bcache: Fix another bug recovering from unclean shutdown

The on disk bucket gens are allowed to be out of date, when we reuse buckets
that didn't have any live data in them. To deal with this, the initial gc has to
update the bucket gen when we find a pointer gen newer than the bucket's gen.

Unfortunately we weren't doing this for pointers in the journal that we're about
to replay.
