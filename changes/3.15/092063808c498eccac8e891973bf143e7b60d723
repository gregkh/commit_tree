ia64/efi: Implement efi_enabled()

There's no good reason to keep efi_enabled() under CONFIG_X86 anymore,
since nothing about the implementation is specific to x86.

Set EFI feature flags in the ia64 boot path instead of claiming to
support all features. The old behaviour was actually buggy since
efi.memmap never points to a valid memory map, so we shouldn't be
claiming to support EFI_MEMMAP.

Fortunately, this bug was never triggered because EFI_MEMMAP isn't used
outside of arch/x86 currently, but that may not always be the case.
