of: add functions to count number of elements in a property

The need to know the number of array elements in a property is
a common pattern. To prevent duplication of open-coded implementations
add a helper static function that also centralises strict sanity
checking and DTB format details, as well as a set of wrapper functions
for u8, u16, u32 and u64.
