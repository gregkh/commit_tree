dm mpath: fix lock order inconsistency in multipath_ioctl

Commit 3e9f1be1b40 ("dm mpath: remove process_queued_ios()") did not
consistently take the multipath device's spinlock (m->lock) before
calling dm_table_run_md_queue_async() -- which takes the q->queue_lock.

Found with code inspection using hint from reported lockdep warning.
