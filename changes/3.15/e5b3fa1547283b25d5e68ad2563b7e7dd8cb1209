isdn: pcbit: fix interruptible_sleep_on race

interruptible_sleep_on is racy and going away. In case of pcbit,
the driver would run into a timeout if the card is initialized
before we start waiting for it. This uses wait_event to fix the
race. In order to do this, the state machine handling for the
timeout case has to get trivially reorganized so we actually know
whether the timeout has occorred or not.
