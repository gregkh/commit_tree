i40e/i40evf: Use correct number of VF vectors

Now that the 2.4 firmware reports the correct number of MSI-X vectors,
use this value correctly when communicating with the VF, and when
setting up the interrupt linked list.

The PF has always reported the correct number of MSI-X vectors, so we
should never increment the value in the vf driver.
