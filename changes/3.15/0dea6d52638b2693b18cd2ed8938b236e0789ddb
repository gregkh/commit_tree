    Tracepoint: Dissociate from module mutex

The following functions became unnecessary:

- tracepoint_probe_register_noupdate,
- tracepoint_probe_unregister_noupdate,
- tracepoint_probe_update_all.

In fact, none of the in-kernel tracers, nor LTTng, nor SystemTAP use
them. Remove those.

Moreover, the functions:

- tracepoint_iter_start,
- tracepoint_iter_next,
- tracepoint_iter_stop,
- tracepoint_iter_reset.

are unused by in-kernel tracers, LTTng and SystemTAP. Remove those too.
