ACPICA: acpidump: Remove integer types translation protection.

Remove translation protection for applications as Linux tools folder will
start to use such types.

In Linux kernel source tree, after removing this translation protection,
the u8/u16/u32/u64/s32/s64 typedefs are exposed for both __KERNEL__ builds
and !__KERNEL__ builds (tools/power/acpi) and the original definitions of
ACPI_UINT8/16/32/64_MAX are changed.

For !__KERNEL__ builds, this kind of defintions should already been tested
by the distribution vendors that are distributing binary ACPICA package and
we've achieved the successful built/run test result in the kernel source
tree.

For __KERNEL__ builds, there are 2 things affected:
1. u8/u16/u32/u64/s32/s64 type definitions:
   Since Linux has already type defined u8/u16/u32/u64/s32/s64 in
   include/uapi/asm-generic/int-ll64.h for __KERNEL__.  In order not to
   introduce build regressions where the 2 typedefs are differed,
   ACPI_USE_SYSTEM_INTTYPES is introduced to mask out ACPICA's typedefs.
   It must be defined for Linux __KERNEL__ builds.
2. ACPI_UINT8/16/32/64_MAX definitions:
   Before applying this change:
     ACPI_UINT8_MAX: sizeof (UINT8)
      UINT8: unsigned char
     ACPI_UINT16_MAX: sizeof (UINT16)
      UINT16: unsigned short
     ACPI_UINT32_MAX: sizeof (UINT32)
      INT32: int
      UINT32: unsigned int
     ACPI_UINT64_MAX: sizeof (UINT64)
      INT64: COMPILER_DEPENDENT_INT64
       COMPILER_DEPENDENT_INT64: signed long (IA64) or
                                 signed long long (IA32)
      UINT64: COMPILER_DEPENDENT_UINT64
       COMPILER_DEPENDENT_UINT64: unsigned long (IA64) or
                                  unsigned long long (IA32)
   After applying this change:
     ACPI_UINT8_MAX: sizeof (u8)
      u8: unsigned char
      UINT8: (removed from actypes.h)
     ACPI_UINT16_MAX: sizeof (u16)
      u16: unsigned short
      UINT16: (removed from actypes.h)
     ACPI_UINT32_MAX: sizeof (u32)
      INT32/UINT32: (removed from actypes.h)
      s32: signed int
      u32: unsigned int
     ACPI_UINT64_MAX: sizeof (u64)
      INT64/UINT64: (removed from actypes.h)
      u64: unsigned long long
      s64: signed long long
      COMPILER_DEPENDENT_INT64: signed long (IA64) (not used any more)
                                signed long long (IA32) (not used any more)
      COMPILER_DEPENDENT_UINT64: unsigned long (IA64) (not used any more)
                                 unsigned long long (IA32) (not used any more)
   All definitions are equal except ACPI_UINT64_MAX for CONFIG_IA64.  It
   is changed from sizeof(unsigned long) to sizeof(unsigned long long).
   By investigation, 64bit Linux kernel build is LP64 compliant, i.e.,
   sizeof(long) and (pointer) are 64.  As sizeof(unsigned long) equals to
   sizeof(unsigned long long) on IA64 platform where CONFIG_64BIT cannot be
   disabled, this change actually will not affect the value of
   ACPI_UINT64_MAX on IA64 platforms.

This patch is necessary for the ACPICA's acpidump tool to build
correctly.  Lv Zheng.
