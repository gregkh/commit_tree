mfd: da9063: Add support for production silicon variant code

Add the correct silicon variant code ID (0x5) to the driver. This
new code is the 'production' variant code ID for DA9063.

This patch will remove the older variant code ID which matches the
pre-production silicon ID (0x3) for the DA9063 chip.

There is also some small amount of correction done in this patch:
it splits the revision code and correctly names it according to
the hardware specification and moves the dev_info() call before
the variant ID test.
