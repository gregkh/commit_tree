cgroup: remove cgroup_root_mutex

cgroup_root_mutex was added to avoid deadlock involving namespace_sem
via cgroup_show_options().  It added a lot of overhead for the small
purpose of it and, because it's nested under cgroup_mutex, it has very
limited usefulness.  The previous patch made cgroup_show_options() not
use cgroup_root_mutex, so nobody needs it anymore.  Remove it.
