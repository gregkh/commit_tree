HID: sony: Add modified Dualshock 4 Bluetooth HID descriptor

By default, the Dualshock 4 sends controller data via report 1. Once a valid
output report 0x11 is received or a feature report of type 0x02 is requested the
controller changes from sending data in report 1 to sending data in report 17,
which is unmapped in the default descriptor. The mappings have to be moved to
report 17 to let the HID driver properly process the incoming reports.
