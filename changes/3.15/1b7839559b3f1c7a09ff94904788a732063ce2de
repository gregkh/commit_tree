powerpc: Split timer_interrupt() into timer handling and interrupt handling routines

Split timer_interrupt(), which is the local timer interrupt handler on ppc
into routines called during regular interrupt handling and __timer_interrupt(),
which takes care of running local timers and collecting time related stats.

This will enable callers interested only in running expired local timers to
directly call into __timer_interupt(). One of the use cases of this is the
tick broadcast IPI handling in which the sleeping CPUs need to handle the local
timers that have expired.
