mm, hugetlb: unify region structure handling

Currently, to track reserved and allocated regions, we use two different
ways, depending on the mapping.  For MAP_SHARED, we use
address_mapping's private_list and, while for MAP_PRIVATE, we use a
resv_map.

Now, we are preparing to change a coarse grained lock which protect a
region structure to fine grained lock, and this difference hinder it.
So, before changing it, unify region structure handling, consistently
using a resv_map regardless of the kind of mapping.
