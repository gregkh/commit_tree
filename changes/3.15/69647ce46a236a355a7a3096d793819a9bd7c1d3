ipv4: use ip_skb_dst_mtu to determine mtu in ip_fragment

ip_skb_dst_mtu mostly falls back to ip_dst_mtu_maybe_forward if no socket
is attached to the skb (in case of forwarding) or determines the mtu like
we do in ip_finish_output, which actually checks if we should branch to
ip_fragment. Thus use the same function to determine the mtu here, too.

This is important for the introduction of IP_PMTUDISC_OMIT, where we
want the packets getting cut in pieces of the size of the outgoing
interface mtu. IPv6 already does this correctly.
