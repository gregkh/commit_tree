x86/efi: Preserve segment registers in mixed mode

I was triggering a #GP(0) from userland when running with
CONFIG_EFI_MIXED and CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION, from what looked like
register corruption. Turns out that the mixed mode code was trashing the
contents of %ds, %es and %ss in __efi64_thunk().

Save and restore the contents of these segment registers across the call
to __efi64_thunk() so that we don't corrupt the CPU context.
