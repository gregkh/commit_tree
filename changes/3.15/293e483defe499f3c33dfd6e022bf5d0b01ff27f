HID: cp2112: remove various hid_out_raw_report calls

hid_out_raw_report is going to be obsoleted as it is not part of the
unified HID low level transport documentation
(Documentation/hid/hid-transport.txt)

  hid_output_raw_report(hdev, buf, sizeof(buf), HID_FEATURE_REPORT);
is strictly equivalent to:
  hid_hw_raw_request(hdev, buf[0], buf, sizeof(buf),
		HID_FEATURE_REPORT, HID_REQ_SET_REPORT);

Then replace buf[0] by the appropriate define.

So use the new api.
