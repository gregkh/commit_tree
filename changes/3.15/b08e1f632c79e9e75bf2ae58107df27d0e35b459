mtd: nand: omap: ecc.correct: omap_elm_correct_data: cleanup for future enhancements

Current omap_elm_correct_data() code is not scalable for future ecc-schemes
due to presence of tweaks and hard-coded macros for BCH4_ECC and BCH8_ECC
ecc-schemes at multiple places.

This patch:
 - replaces 'ecc_opt' with '(info->nand.ecc.strength == BCH8_MAX_ERROR)
   used to differentiate between BCH8_HW and BCH4_SW
 - replaces macros (defining magic number for specific ecc-scheme) with
   generic variables
 - removes dependency on macros defined in elm.h (like BCHx_ECC_OOB_BYTES)
