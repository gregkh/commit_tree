cifs: Use min_t() when comparing "size_t" and "unsigned long"

On 32 bit, size_t is "unsigned int", not "unsigned long", causing the
following warning when comparing with PAGE_SIZE, which is always "unsigned
long":

  fs/cifs/file.c: In function ‘cifs_readdata_to_iov’:
  fs/cifs/file.c:2757: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast

Introduced by commit 7f25bba819a3 ("cifs_iovec_read: keep iov_iter
between the calls of cifs_readdata_to_iov()"), which changed the
signedness of "remaining" and the code from min_t() to min().
