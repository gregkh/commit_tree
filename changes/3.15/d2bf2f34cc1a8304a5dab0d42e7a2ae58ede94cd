netfilter: nft_ct: labels get support

This also adds NF_CT_LABELS_MAX_SIZE so it can be re-used
as BUILD_BUG_ON in nft_ct.

At this time, nft doesn't yet support writing to the label area;
when this changes the label->words handling needs to be moved
out of xt_connlabel.c into nf_conntrack_labels.c.

Also removes a useless run-time check: words cannot grow beyond
4 (32 bit) or 2 (64bit) since xt_connlabel enforces a maximum of
128 labels.
