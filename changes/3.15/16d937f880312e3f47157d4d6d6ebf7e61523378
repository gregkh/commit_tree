timers: Reduce future __run_timers() latency for newly emptied list

The __run_timers() function currently steps through the list one jiffy at
a time in order to update the timer wheel.  However, if the timer wheel
is empty, no adjustment is needed other than updating ->timer_jiffies.
Therefore, if we just emptied the timer wheel, for example, by deleting
the last timer, we should mark the timer wheel as being up to date.
This marking will reduce (and perhaps eliminate) the jiffy-stepping that
a future __run_timers() call will need to do in response to some future
timer posting or migration.  This commit therefore catches ->timer_jiffies
for this case.
