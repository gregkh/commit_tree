ceph: set mds_wanted when MDS reply changes a cap to auth cap

When adjusting caps client wants, MDS does not record caps that are
not allowed. For non-auth MDS, it does not record WR caps. So when
a MDS reply changes a non-auth cap to auth cap, client needs to set
cap's mds_wanted according to the reply.
