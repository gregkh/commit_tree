Input: gtco - fix usb_dev leak

There is usb_get_dev() in gtco_probe(), but there is no usb_put_dev()
anywhere in the driver.

As pointed out by Dmitry Torokhov:
The lifetime of gtco structure is already directly tied to lifetime of
usb_dev: when destroying usb_dev driver core will call remove() function
of currently bound driver (in our case gtco) which will destroy gtco
memory. Taking additional reference is not needed here.
