phy: core: make NULL a valid phy reference if !CONFIG_GENERIC_PHY

This fixes a regression on Keystone 2 platforms caused by patch
57303488cd37da58263e842de134dc65f7c626d5
"usb: dwc3: adapt dwc3 core to use Generic PHY Framework" which adds
optional support of generic phy in DWC3 core.

On Keystone 2 platforms the USB is not working now because
CONFIG_GENERIC_PHY isn't set and, as result, Generic PHY APIs stubs
return -ENOSYS always. The log shows:
 dwc3 2690000.dwc3: failed to initialize core
 dwc3: probe of 2690000.dwc3 failed with error -38

Hence, fix it by making NULL a valid phy reference in Generic PHY
APIs stubs in the same way as it was done by the patch
04c2facad8fee66c981a51852806d8923336f362 "drivers: phy: Make NULL
a valid phy reference".
