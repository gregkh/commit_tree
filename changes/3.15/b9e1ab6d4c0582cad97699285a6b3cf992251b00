perf/x86/uncore: add SNB/IVB/HSW client uncore memory controller support

This patch adds a new uncore PMU for Intel SNB/IVB/HSW client
CPUs. It adds the Integrated Memory Controller (IMC) PMU. This
new PMU provides a set of events to measure memory bandwidth utilization.

The IMC on those processor is PCI-space based. This patch
exposes a new uncore PMU on those processor: uncore_imc

Two new events are defined:
  - name: data_reads
  - code: 0x1
  - unit: 64 bytes
  - number of full cacheline read requests to the IMC

  - name: data_writes
  - code: 0x2
  - unit: 64 bytes
  - number of full cacheline write requests to the IMC
