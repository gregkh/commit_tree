perf stat: Initialize statistics correctly

perf stat did initialize the stats structure used to compute
stddev etc. incorrectly. It merely zeroes it. But one member
(min) needs to be set to a non zero value. This causes min
to be not computed at all. Call init_stats() correctly.

It doesn't matter for stat currently because it doesn't use
min, but it's still better to do it correctly.

The other users of statistics are already correct.
