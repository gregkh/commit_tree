s390/mm,tlb: optimize TLB flushing for zEC12

The zEC12 machines introduced the local-clearing control for the IDTE
and IPTE instruction. If the control is set only the TLB of the local
CPU is cleared of entries, either all entries of a single address space
for IDTE, or the entry for a single page-table entry for IPTE.
Without the local-clearing control the TLB flush is broadcasted to all
CPUs in the configuration, which is expensive.

The reset of the bit mask of the CPUs that need flushing after a
non-local IDTE is tricky. As TLB entries for an address space remain
in the TLB even if the address space is detached a new bit field is
required to keep track of attached CPUs vs. CPUs in the need of a
flush. After a non-local flush with IDTE the bit-field of attached CPUs
is copied to the bit-field of CPUs in need of a flush. The ordering
of operations on cpu_attach_mask, attach_count and mm_cpumask(mm) is
such that an underindication in mm_cpumask(mm) is prevented but an
overindication in mm_cpumask(mm) is possible.
