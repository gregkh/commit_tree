ARM: mvebu: ensure the mdio node has a clock reference on Armada 370/XP

The mvmdio driver accesses some register of the Ethernet unit. It
therefore takes a reference and enables a clock. However, on Armada
370/XP, no clock specification was given in the Device Tree, which
leads the mvmdio driver to fail when being used as a module and loaded
before the mvneta driver: it tries to access a register from a
hardware unit that isn't clocked.
