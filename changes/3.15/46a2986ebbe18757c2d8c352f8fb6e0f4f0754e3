Input: synaptics - add min/max quirk for ThinkPad T431s, L440, L540, S1 Yoga and X1

We expect that all the Haswell series will need such quirks, sigh.

The T431s seems to be T430 hardware in a T440s case, using the T440s touchpad,
with the same min/max issue.

The X1 Carbon 3rd generation name says 2nd while it is a 3rd generation.

The X1 and T431s share a PnPID with the T540p, but the reported ranges are
closer to those of the T440s.

HdG: Squashed 5 quirk patches into one. T431s + L440 + L540 are written by me,
S1 Yoga and X1 are written by Benjamin Tissoires.

Hdg: Standardized S1 Yoga and X1 values, Yoga uses the same touchpad as the
X240, X1 uses the same touchpad as the T440.
