SCSI/libiscsi: Add check_protection callback for transports

iSCSI needs to be at least aware that a task involves protection
information.  In case it does, after the transaction completed libiscsi
will ask the transport to check the protection status of the
transaction.

Unlike transport errors, DIF errors should not prevent successful
completion of the transaction from the transport point of view, but
should be escelated to scsi mid-layer when constructing the scsi
result and sense data.

check_protection routine will return the ascq corresponding to the DIF
error that occured (or 0 if no error happened).

return ascq:
- 0x1: GUARD_CHECK_FAILED
- 0x2: APPTAG_CHECK_FAILED
- 0x3: REFTAG_CHECK_FAILED
