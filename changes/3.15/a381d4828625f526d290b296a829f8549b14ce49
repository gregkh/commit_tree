NFC: digital: Add Digital Layer support for ISO/IEC 15693

Add support for ISO/IEC 15693 to the digital layer.  The code
currently uses single-slot anticollision only since the digital
layer infrastructure only supports one tag per adapter (making
it pointless to do 16-slot anticollision).

The code uses two new framing types:
'NFC_DIGITAL_FRAMING_ISO15693_INVENTORY' and
'NFC_DIGITAL_FRAMING_ISO15693_TVT'.  The former is used to
tell the driver to prepare for an Inventory command and the
ensuing anticollision sequence.  The latter is used to tell
the driver that the anticollision sequence is over and to
prepare for non-inventory commands.
