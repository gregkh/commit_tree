mei: me: do not load the driver if the FW doesn't support MEI interface

NM and SPS  FW types that may run on ME device on server platforms
do not have valid MEI/HECI interface and driver should not
be bound to it as this might lead to system hung.
In practice not all BIOSes effectively hide such devices from the
OS and in some cases it is not possible.

We determine FW type by examining Host FW status registers in order to
unbind the driver.
In this patch we are adding check for ME on Cougar Point, Lynx Point
Devices
