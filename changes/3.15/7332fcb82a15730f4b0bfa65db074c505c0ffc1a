at86rf230: fix unexpected state change

This patch fix a unexpected state change for the at86rf231 chip.
We can't change into STATE_FORCE_TX_ON while the chip is in one of
SLEEP, P_ON, RESET, TRX_OFF, and all *_NOCLK states.

In this case we are in the TRX_OFF state. See datasheet [1] page 71 for
more information.

Without this patch you will get the following message on a at86rf231 device:
