Input: zforce - reduce stack memory allocated to frames

A frame is a u8 array with the following structure:
[PAYLOAD_HEADER, PAYLOAD_LENGTH, ...PAYLOAD_BODY...]

PAYLOAD_BODY can be at most 255 bytes long, as it's size is represented
by PAYLOAD_LENGTH. Therefore we can reduce the stack memory allocated to
payload_buffer[] roughly by half, from 512 to 257 bytes.
