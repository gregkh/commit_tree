MIPS: Restore init.h usage to arch/mips/ar7/time.c

Commit 0046be10e0c502705fc74d91408eba13a73bc201 ("mips: delete
non-required instances of include <linux/init.h>") inadvertently
removed an include that was actually correct.  Restore it.

Note that it gets init.h implicitly anyway, so this is largely a
cosmetic fixup; no build regressions were caused by this.
