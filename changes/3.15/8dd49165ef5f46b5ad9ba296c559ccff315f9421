mtd: nand: Add a devicetree binding for ECC strength and ECC step size

Some flashes can only be properly accessed when the ECC mode is
specified, so a way to describe such mode is required.

Together, the ECC strength and step size define the correction capability,
so that we say we will correct "{strength} bit errors per {size} bytes".

The interpretation of these parameters is implementation-defined, but they
often have ramifications on the formation, interpretation, and placement of
correction metadata on the flash. Not all implementations must support all
possible combinations. Implementations are encouraged to further define the
value(s) they support.
