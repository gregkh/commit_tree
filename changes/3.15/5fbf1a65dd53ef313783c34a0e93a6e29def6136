Revert "tty: Fix race condition between __tty_buffer_request_room and flush_to_ldisc"

This reverts commit 6a20dbd6caa2358716136144bf524331d70b1e03.

Although the commit correctly identifies an unsafe race condition
between __tty_buffer_request_room() and flush_to_ldisc(), the commit
fixes the race with an unnecessary spinlock in a lockless algorithm.

The follow-on commit, "tty: Fix lockless tty buffer race" fixes
the race locklessly.
