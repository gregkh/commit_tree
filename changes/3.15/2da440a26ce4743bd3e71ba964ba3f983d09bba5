cgroup: introduce cgroup_init/exit_cftypes()

Factor out cft->ss initialization into cgroup_init_cftypes() from
cgroup_add_cftypes() and add cft->ss clearing to cgroup_rm_cftypes()
through cgroup_exit_cftypes().

This doesn't make any meaningful difference now but the two new
functions will be expanded during kernfs transition.
