batman-adv: Modified forwarding behaviour for multicast packets

With this patch a multicast packet is not always simply flooded anymore,
the behaviour for the following cases is changed to reduce
unnecessary overhead:

If all nodes within the horizon of a certain node have signalized
multicast listener announcement capability then an IPv6 multicast packet
with a destination of IPv6 link-local scope (excluding ff02::1) coming
from the upstream of this node...

* ...is dropped if there is no according multicast listener in the
  translation table,
* ...is forwarded via unicast if there is a single node with interested
  multicast listeners
* ...and otherwise still gets flooded.
