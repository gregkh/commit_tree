block: remove old blk_iopoll_enabled variable

This was a debugging measure to toggle enabled/disabled
when testing. But for real production setups, it's not
safe to toggle this setting without either reloading
drivers of quiescing IO first. Neither of which the toggle
enforces.

Additionally, it makes drivers deal with the conditional
state.

Remove it completely. It's up to the driver whether iopoll
is enabled or not.
