ASoC: pxa: zylonite: Convert to table based DAPM setup

Use table based setup to register the DAPM widgets and routes. This on one hand
makes the code a bit cleaner and on the other hand the board level DAPM elements
get registered in the card's DAPM context rather than in the CODEC's DAPM
context.

Also drop the two snd_soc_dapm_enable_pin() since pins are enabled by default
and there is no matching snd_soc_dapm_disable_pin() in the driver.
