via-rhine: Call dev_kfree/consume_skb_any instead of dev_kfree_skb.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_kfree_skb_any in rhine_start_tx which
can be called in hard irq and other contexts.  Packets are only freed
in rhine_start_tx if they are dropped.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in rhine_tx that can be
called in hard irq and other contexts.  rhine_tx handles successfully
transmitted packets.
