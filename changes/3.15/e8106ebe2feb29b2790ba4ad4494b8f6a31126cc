i40evf: change type of flags variable

As pointed out by Dan Carpenter (from Oracle), the flags variable is
declared as a 64-bit long but all of the flags are defined as u32,
which may lead to unintended consequences. Fix this by declaring flags
as u32 (since we don't need any more than about a dozen flags right
now), and remove the volatile qualifier, since it's unnecessary and
just makes checkpatch cry.
