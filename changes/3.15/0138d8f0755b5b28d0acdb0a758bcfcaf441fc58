intel_idle: fine-tune IVT residency targets

Ivy Town processors have slightly different properties
than Ivy Bridge processors, particuarly as socket count grows.
Here we add dedicated tables covering 1-2 socket,
3-4 socket, and > 4 socket IVT configurations.

This reduces the frequency of deep transitions on those systems,
which can impact throughput.
