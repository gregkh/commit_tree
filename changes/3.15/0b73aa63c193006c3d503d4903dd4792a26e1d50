spi: Fix handling of cs_change in core implementation

The core implementation of cs_change didn't follow the documentation
which says that cs_change in the middle of the transfer means to briefly
deassert chip select, instead it followed buggy drivers which change the
polarity of chip select.  Use a delay of 10us between deassert and
reassert simply from pulling numbers out of a hat.
