x86/efi: Add mixed runtime services support

Setup the runtime services based on whether we're booting in EFI native
mode or not. For non-native mode we need to thunk from 64-bit into
32-bit mode before invoking the EFI runtime services.

Using the runtime services after SetVirtualAddressMap() is slightly more
complicated because we need to ensure that all the addresses we pass to
the firmware are below the 4GB boundary so that they can be addressed
with 32-bit pointers, see efi_setup_page_tables().
