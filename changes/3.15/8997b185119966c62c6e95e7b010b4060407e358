cpufreq: powernow-k7: Fix double invocation of cpufreq_freq_transition_begin/end

During frequency transitions, the cpufreq core takes the responsibility of
invoking cpufreq_freq_transition_begin() and cpufreq_freq_transition_end()
for those cpufreq drivers that define the ->target_index callback but don't
set the ASYNC_NOTIFICATION flag.

The powernow-k7 cpufreq driver falls under this category, but this driver was
invoking the _begin() and _end() APIs itself around frequency transitions,
which led to double invocation of the _begin() API. The _begin API makes
contending callers wait until the previous invocation is complete. Hence,
the powernow-k7 driver ended up waiting on itself, leading to system hangs
during boot.

Fix this by removing the calls to the _begin() and _end() APIs from the
powernow-k7 driver, since they rightly belong to the cpufreq core.
