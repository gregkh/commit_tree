uas: Add Hans de Goede as uas maintainer

At the kernel-summit Sarah Sharp asked me if I was willing to become the
uas maintainer. I said yes, and here is a patch to make this official.

Also remove Matthew Wilcox and Sarah Sharp as maintainers at their request.

I've also added myself to the module's author tag, so that if people look there
rather then in maintainers they will know they should bug me about uas too.
