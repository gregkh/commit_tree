checkpatch: make "return is not a function" test quieter

This test is a bit noisy and opinions seem to agree that it should not
warn in a lot more situations.

It seems people agree that:

	return (foo || bar);
and
	return foo || bar;

are both acceptable style and checkpatch should be silent about them.

For now, it warns on parentheses around a simple constant or a single
function or a ternary.

	return (foo);
	return (foo(bar));
	return (foo ? bar : baz);

The last ternary test may be quieted in the future.

Modify the deparenthesize function to only strip balanced leading and
trailing parentheses.
