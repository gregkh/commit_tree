Staging: comedi: addi-data: tidy up digital input register map defines in hwdrv_apci1564.c

This patch fixes the register map defines for the digital input registers
such that they are all the real offsets to each register, rather than a
mix of real offsets and adders to those offsets.

Further, some of the old defines were being used incorrectly in the
i_APCI1564_Reset() function.  Upon swapping the old defines out for the
new ones in this function, their use has been corrected.
