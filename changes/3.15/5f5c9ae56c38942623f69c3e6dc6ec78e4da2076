serial_core: Unregister console in uart_remove_one_port()

If the serial port being removed is used as a console, it must also be
unregistered from the console subsystem using unregister_console().

uart_ops.release_port() will release resources (e.g. iounmap() the serial
port registers), causing a crash on subsequent kernel output if the console
is still registered.
