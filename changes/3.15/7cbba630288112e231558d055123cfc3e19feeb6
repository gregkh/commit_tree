powerpc/perf: Avoid mutating event in power8_get_constraint()

We only need to mask the EBB bit out of the event for the check of the
special PMC 5 & 6 events. So use a local to do it just for that code,
rather than changing the event value for the life of the function.

While we're there move the set of mask and value after all the checks.
