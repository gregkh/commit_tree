drm/crtc: add sanity checks to create_dumb()

Lets make sure some basic expressions are always true:
  bpp != NULL
  width != NULL
  height != NULL
  stride = bpp * width < 2^32
  size = stride * height < 2^32
  PAGE_ALIGN(size) < 2^32

At least the udl driver doesn't check for multiplication-overflows, so
lets just make sure it will never happen. These checks allow drivers to do
any 32bit math without having to test for mult-overflows themselves.

The two divisions might hurt performance a bit, but dumb_create() is only
used for scanout-buffers, so that should be fine. We could use 64bit math
to avoid the divisions, but that may be slow on 32bit machines.. Or maybe
there should just be a "safe_mult32()" helper, which currently doesn't
exist (I think?).
