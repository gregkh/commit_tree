[media] vb2: properly clean up PREPARED and QUEUED buffers

If __reqbufs was called then existing buffers are freed. However, if that
happens without ever having started STREAMON, but if buffers have been queued,
then the buf_finish op is never called.

Add a call to __vb2_queue_cancel in __reqbufs so that these buffers are
cleaned up there as well.
