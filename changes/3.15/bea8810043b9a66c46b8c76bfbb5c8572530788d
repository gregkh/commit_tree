staging: r8188eu: Replace misspelled local container macro

This driver has its own implementation of a "container_of" macro. It
is replaced with the standard container_of version. Most of these
are a straight one-to-one replacement; however, a few of the instances
referred to the member of a union. Those were replaced with the
struct that is part of that union.
