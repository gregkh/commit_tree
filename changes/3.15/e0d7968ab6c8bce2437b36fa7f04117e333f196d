bridge: Prevent insertion of FDB entry with disallowed vlan

br_handle_local_finish() is allowing us to insert an FDB entry with
disallowed vlan. For example, when port 1 and 2 are communicating in
vlan 10, and even if vlan 10 is disallowed on port 3, port 3 can
interfere with their communication by spoofed src mac address with
vlan id 10.

Note: Even if it is judged that a frame should not be learned, it should
not be dropped because it is destined for not forwarding layer but higher
layer. See IEEE 802.1Q-2011 8.13.10.
