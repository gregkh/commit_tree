    drm/i915: disable rings before HW status page setup

we reordered stopping the rings to do so before we set the HWS register.
However, there is an extra workaround for g45 to reset the rings twice,
and for consistency we should apply that workaround before setting the
HWS to be sure that the rings are truly stopped.
