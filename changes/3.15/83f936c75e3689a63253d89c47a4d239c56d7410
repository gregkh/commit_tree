mark struct file that had write access grabbed by open()

new flag in ->f_mode - FMODE_WRITER.  Set by do_dentry_open() in case
when it has grabbed write access, checked by __fput() to decide whether
it wants to drop the sucker.  Allows to stop bothering with mnt_clone_write()
in alloc_file(), along with fewer special_file() checks.
