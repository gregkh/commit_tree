ARM: trusted_foundations: fallback when TF support is missing

When Trusted Foundations is detected as present on the system, but
Trusted Foundations support is not built into the kernel, the kernel
used to issue a panic very early during boot, leaving little clue to the
user as to what is going wrong.

It turns out that even without TF support built-in, the kernel can boot
on a TF-enabled system provided that SMP and cpuidle are disabled. This
patch does this and continue booting on one CPU, leaving the user with a
usable (however degraded) system.
