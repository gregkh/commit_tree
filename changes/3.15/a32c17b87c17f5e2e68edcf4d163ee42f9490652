ASoC: core: Fix check before setting default I/O up try regmap

Since the CODEC driver could specify its own I/O(read and write)
while registering the CODEC for some reason, maybe the MFDs is
used, etc.

So just do check it, if they are not specified by CODEC driver
then try to set up the default regmap I/O if regmap is used.
