staging: comedi: pcl816: introduce pcl816_ai_clear_eoc()

Introduce a helper function to clear the end-of-conversion flag.

This flag is set when an analog input conversion is finished and the
hardware generates an interrupt request. Writing any value to the
register resets the flag and re-enables the interrupt.

Move the call in pcl816_ai_cancel() so that the flag is reset after
stopping the A/D.
