procfs: make /proc/*/{stack,syscall,personality} 0400

These procfs files contain sensitive information and currently their
mode is 0444.  Change this to 0400, so the VFS will be able to block
unprivileged processes from getting file descriptors on arbitrary
privileged /proc/*/{stack,syscall,personality} files.

This reduces the scope of ASLR leaking and bypasses by protecting already
running processes.
