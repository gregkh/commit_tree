isdn: divert, hysdn: fix interruptible_sleep_on race

These two drivers use identical code for their procfs status
file handling, which contains a small race against status
data becoming available while reading the file.

This uses wait_event_interruptible instead to fix this
particular race and eventually get rid of all sleep_on
instances. There seems to be another race involving
multiple concurrent readers of the same procfs file, which
I don't try to fix here.
