i2c: designware-pci: set ideal HCNT, LCNT and SDA hold time value

On Intel BayTrail, there was case whereby the resulting fast mode
bus speed becomes slower (~20% slower compared to expected speed)
if using the HCNT/LCNT calculated in the core layer. Thus, this
patch is added to allow pci glue layer to pass in optimal
HCNT/LCNT/SDA hold time values to core layer since the core
layer supports cofigurable HCNT/LCNT/SDA hold time values now.
