fs/hfsplus/extents.c: fix concurrent acess of alloc_blocks

Concurrent access to alloc_blocks in hfsplus_inode_info() is protected
by extents_lock mutex.  This patch fixes two instances where
alloc_blocks modification was not protected with this lock.

This fixes possible allocation bitmap corruption in race conditions
while extending and truncating files.
