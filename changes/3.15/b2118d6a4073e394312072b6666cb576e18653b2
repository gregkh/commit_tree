ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Rework acpiphp_no_hotplug()

If a struct acpi_device pointer is passed to acpiphp_no_hotplug()
instead of an ACPI handle, the function won't need to call
acpi_bus_get_device(), which may be costly, any more.  Then,
trim_stale_devices() can call acpiphp_no_hotplug() passing
the struct acpi_device object it already has directly to that
function.

Make those changes and update slot_no_hotplug() accordingly.
