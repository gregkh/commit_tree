KVM: Simplify kvm->tlbs_dirty handling

When this was introduced, kvm_flush_remote_tlbs() could be called
without holding mmu_lock.  It is now acknowledged that the function
must be called before releasing mmu_lock, and all callers have already
been changed to do so.

There is no need to use smp_mb() and cmpxchg() any more.
