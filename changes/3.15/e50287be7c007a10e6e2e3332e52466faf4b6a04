be2net: dma_sync each RX frag before passing it to the stack

The driver currently maps a page for DMA, divides the page into multiple
frags and posts them to the HW. It un-maps the page after data is received
on all the frags of the page. This scheme doesn't work when bounce buffers
are used for DMA (swiotlb=force kernel param).

This patch fixes this problem by calling dma_sync_single_for_cpu() for each
frag (excepting the last one) so that the data is copied from the bounce
buffers. The page is un-mapped only when DMA finishes on the last frag of
the page.
(Thanks Ben H. for suggesting the dma_sync API!)

This patch also renames the "last_page_user" field of be_rx_page_info{}
struct to "last_frag" to improve readability of the fixed code.
