[SCSI] hpsa: use extended report luns command for HP SSD SmartPath

There is an extended report luns command which contains
additional information about physical devices.  In particular
we need to get the physical device handle so we can use an
alternate i/o path for fast physical devices like SSDs so
we can speed up certain i/o's by bypassing the RAID stack
code in the controller firmware.
