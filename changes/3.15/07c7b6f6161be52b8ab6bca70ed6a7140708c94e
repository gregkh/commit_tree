can: c_can: Fix the lost message handling

The lost message handling is broken in several ways.

1) Clearing the message lost flag is done by writing 0 to the
   message control register of the object.

   #define IF_MCONT_CLR_MSGLST    (0 << 14)

   That clears the object buffer configuration in the worst case,
   which results in a loss of the EOB flag. That leaves the FIFO chain
   without a limit and causes a complete lockup of the HW

2) In case that the error skb allocation fails, the code happily
   claims that it handed down a packet. Just an accounting bug, but ....

3) The code adds a lot of pointless overhead to that error case, where
   we need to get stuff done as fast as possible to avoid more packet
   loss.

   - printk an annoying error message
   - reread the object buffer for nothing

Fix is simple again:

  - Use the already known MSGCTRL content and only clear the MSGLST bit
  - Fix the buffer accounting by adding a proper return code
  - Remove the pointless operations
