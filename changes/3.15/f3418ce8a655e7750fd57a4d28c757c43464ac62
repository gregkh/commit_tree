staging/lustre/idl: remove LASSERT/CLASSERT from lustre_idl.h

Remove the usage of LASSERT() and CLASSERT() from lustre_idl.h, so
that it is usable from userspace programs if needed.  These have
crept in over the years, but are not intended to be there.

The CLASSERT() checks for fid swabbing were largely redundant, and
have been moved to lustre/fid/fid_handler.c.

There are still a few LASSERTs that need to be removed when FID-on-OST
is landed, but I don't want to remove them before that code lands.

There are also uses of CERROR() that could be removed at that time.
