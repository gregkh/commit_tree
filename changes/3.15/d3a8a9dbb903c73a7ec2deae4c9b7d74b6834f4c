w1: hold bus_mutex in netlink and search

The bus_mutex needs to be taken to serialize access to a specific bus.
netlink wasn't updated when bus_mutex was added and was calling
without that lock held, and not all of the masters were holding the
bus_mutex in a search.  This was causing the ds2490 hardware to stop
responding when both netlink and /sys slaves were executing bus
commands at the same time.
