MIPS: asm: uaccess: Add instruction argument to __{put,get}_user_asm

In preparation for EVA support, an instruction argument is needed
for the __get_user_asm{,_ll32} functions to allow instruction overrides in
EVA mode. Even though EVA only works for MIPS 32-bit, both codepaths are
changed (32-bit and 64-bit) for consistency reasons.
