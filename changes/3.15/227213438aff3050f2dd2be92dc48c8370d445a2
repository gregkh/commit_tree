Revert "drm/i915: enable HiZ Raw Stall Optimization on IVB"

This reverts commit 116f2b6da868dec7539103574d0421cd6221e931.

This optimization causes widespread corruption in games, and even in
glxgears, on my ivb:gt1. The corruption appears like z-fighting of
overlapping polygons in the HiZ buffer.

The observation ties in very closely with the description of the
optimization disabled by default on IVB:

"The Hierarchical Z RAW Stall Optimization allows non-overlapping
polygons in the same 8x4 pixel/sample area to be processed without
stalling waiting for the earlier ones to write to Hierarchical Z
buffer."

No reason is given for why it is disabled by default, usually for such
optimizations it is that it is incomplete. However, there is no
indication whether this a gt1 only issue either. Before considering
reenabling this optimization, I would first suggest reproducing the
corruption in piglit.
