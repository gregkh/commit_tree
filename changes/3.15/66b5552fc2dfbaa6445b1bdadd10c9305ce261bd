netpoll: Rename netpoll_rx_enable/disable to netpoll_poll_disable/enable

The netpoll_rx_enable and netpoll_rx_disable functions have always
controlled polling the network drivers transmit and receive queues.

Rename them to netpoll_poll_enable and netpoll_poll_disable to make
their functionality clear.
