fs/affs/dir.c: unlock/brelse dir on failure + code clean-up

Commit 0edf977d2ae3 ("[readdir] convert affs") returns directly -EIO
without unlocking dir inode and releasing dir bh when second affs_bread
sequence fails.  This patch restores initial behaviour.  It also fixes
pr_debug and affs_error to fit in 80 columns + removes reference to
filldir (replaced by dir_emit in the commit above).
