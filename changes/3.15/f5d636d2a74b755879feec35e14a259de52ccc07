drm/radeon: use pflip irq on R600+ v2

Testing the update pending bit directly after issuing an
update is nonsense cause depending on the pixel clock the
CRTC needs a bit of time to execute the flip even when we
are in the VBLANK period.

This is just a non invasive patch to solve the problem at
hand, a more complete and cleaner solution should follow
in the next merge window.
