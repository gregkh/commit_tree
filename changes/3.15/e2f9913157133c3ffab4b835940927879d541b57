Bluetooth: Add HCI command definition for extended OOB data

The Secure Connections feature introduces the support for P-256 strength
pairings (compared to P-192 with Secure Simple Pairing). This however
means that for out-of-band pairing the hash and randomizer needs to be
differentiated. Two new commands are introduced to handle the possible
combinations of P-192 and P-256. This add the HCI command definition
for both.
