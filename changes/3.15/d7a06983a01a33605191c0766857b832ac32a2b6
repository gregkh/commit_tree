locks: fix locks_mandatory_locked to respect file-private locks

As Trond pointed out, you can currently deadlock yourself by setting a
file-private lock on a file that requires mandatory locking and then
trying to do I/O on it.

Avoid this problem by plumbing some knowledge of file-private locks into
the mandatory locking code. In order to do this, we must pass down
information about the struct file that's being used to
locks_verify_locked.
