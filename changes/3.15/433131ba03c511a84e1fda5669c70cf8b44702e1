net: sctp: remove NULL check in sctp_assoc_update_retran_path

This is basically just to let Coverity et al shut up. Remove an
unneeded NULL check in sctp_assoc_update_retran_path().

It is safe to remove it, because in sctp_assoc_update_retran_path()
we iterate over the list of transports, our own transport which is
asoc->peer.retran_path included. In the iteration, we skip the
list head element and transports in state SCTP_UNCONFIRMED.

Such transports came from peer addresses received in INIT/INIT-ACK
address parameters. They are not yet confirmed by a heartbeat and
not available for data transfers.

We know however that in the list of transports, even if it contains
such elements, it at least contains our asoc->peer.retran_path as
well, so even if next to that element, we only encounter
SCTP_UNCONFIRMED transports, we are always going to fall back to
asoc->peer.retran_path through sctp_trans_elect_best(), as that is
for sure not SCTP_UNCONFIRMED as per fbdf501c9374 ("sctp: Do no
select unconfirmed transports for retransmissions").

Whenever we call sctp_trans_elect_best() it will give us a non-NULL
element back, and therefore when we break out of the loop, we are
guaranteed to have a non-NULL transport pointer, and can remove
the NULL check.
