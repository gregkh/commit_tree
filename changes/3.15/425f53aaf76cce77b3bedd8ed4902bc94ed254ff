[media] em28xx-dvb: fix PCTV 461e tuner I2C binding

Add missing m88ts2022 module reference counts as removing that module
is not allowed when it is used by em28xx-dvb module. That same module
was not unregistered correctly, fix it too.

Error cases validated by returning errors from m88ds3103, m88ts2022
and a8293 probe().
