batman-adv: use vlan_/eth_hdr() instead of skb->data in interface_tx path

Our .ndo_start_xmit handler (batadv_interface_tx()) can rely on having
the skb mac header pointer set correctly since the following commit
present in kernels >= 3.9:

"net: reset mac header in dev_start_xmit()" (6d1ccff627)

Therefore we can safely use eth_hdr() and vlan_eth_hdr() instead of
skb->data now, which spares us some ugly type casts.

At the same time set the mac_header in batadv_dat_snoop_incoming_arp_request()
before sending the skb along the TX path.
