ACPICA: Utilities: Load of local test tables is now optional.

The utility has the capability to load some various tables to test
features of ACPICA. However, there are enough of them that the output
of the utility became confusing. With this change, only the required
local tables are displayed (RSDP, XSDT, etc.) along with the actual
tables loaded via the command line specification. This makes the
default output simler and easier to understand. The -el command line
option restores the original behavior for testing purposes.

This patch doesn't affect kernel behavior as Linux doesn't use ACPICA
allocation tracking implementation.
