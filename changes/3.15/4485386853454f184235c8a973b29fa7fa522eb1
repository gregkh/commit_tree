Btrfs: take into account total references when doing backref lookup

I added an optimization for large files where we would stop searching for
backrefs once we had looked at the number of references we currently had for
this extent.  This works great most of the time, but for snapshots that point to
this extent and has changes in the original root this assumption falls on it
face.  So keep track of any delayed ref mods made and add in the actual ref
count as reported by the extent item and use that to limit how far down an inode
we'll search for extents.  Thanks,
