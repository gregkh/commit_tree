mtd: nand: force NAND_CMD_READID onto 8-bit bus

The NAND command helpers tend to automatically shift the column address
for x16 bus devices, since most commands expect a word address, not a
byte address. The Read ID command, however, expects an 8-bit address
(i.e., 0x00, 0x20, or 0x40 should not be translated to 0x00, 0x10, or
0x20).

This fixes the column address for a few drivers which imitate the
nand_base defaults. Note that I don't touch sh_flctl.c, since it already
handles this problem slightly differently (note its comment "READID is
always performed using an 8-bit bus").

I have not tested this patch, as I only have x8 parts up for testing at
this point. Hopefully that can change soon...
