libata: Update queued trim blacklist for M5x0 drives

Crucial/Micron M500 drives properly support queued DSM TRIM starting
with firmware MU05. Update the blacklist so we only disable queued trim
for older firmware releases.

Early M550 series drives suffer from the same issue as M500. A bugfix
firmware is in the pipeline but not ready yet. Until then, blacklist
queued trim for M550.
