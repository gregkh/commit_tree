cgroup: use cgroup_setup_root() to initialize cgroup_dummy_root

cgroup_dummy_root is used to host controllers which aren't attached to
any other hierarchy.  The root is minimally set up during kernfs
bootstrap and didn't go through full hierarchy initialization.  We're
planning to use cgroup_dummy_root for the default unified hierarchy
and thus want it to be fully functional.

Replace the special initialization, which was collected into
cgroup_init() by the previous patch, with an invocation of
cgroup_setup_root().  This simplifies the init path and makes
cgroup_dummy_root a full hierarchy with its own kernfs_root and all.

As this puts the dummy hierarchy on the cgroup_roots list, rename
for_each_active_root() to for_each_root() and update its users to skip
the dummy root for now.

This patch doesn't cause any userland visible behavior changes at this
point.
