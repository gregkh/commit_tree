hwmon: (ntc_thermistor) Fix dependencies

In commit 9e8269de, support was added for ntc_thermistor devices being
declared in the device tree and implemented on top of IIO. With that
change, a dependency was added to the ntc_thermistor driver:

	depends on (!OF && !IIO) || (OF && IIO)

This construct has the drawback that the driver can no longer be
selected when OF is set and IIO isn't, nor when IIO is set and OF is
not. This is a regression for the original users of the driver.

As the new code depends on IIO and is useless without OF, include it
only if both are enabled, and set the dependencies accordingly. This
is clearer, more simple and more correct.
