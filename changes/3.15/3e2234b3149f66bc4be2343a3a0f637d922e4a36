xen-netback: Handle foreign mapped pages on the guest RX path

RX path need to know if the SKB fragments are stored on pages from another
domain.
Logically this patch should be after introducing the grant mapping itself, as
it makes sense only after that. But to keep bisectability, I moved it here. It
shouldn't change any functionality here. xenvif_zerocopy_callback and
ubuf_to_vif are just stubs here, they will be introduced properly later on.
