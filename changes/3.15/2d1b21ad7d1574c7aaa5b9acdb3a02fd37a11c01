powerpc/perf: Add a shared interface to get gpci version and capabilities

This exposes a simple way to grab the firmware provided
collect_priveliged, ga, expanded, and lab capability bits. All of these
bits come in from the same gpci request, so we've exposed all of them.

Only the collect_priveliged bit is really used by the hv-gpci/hv-24x7
code, the other bits are simply exposed in sysfs to inform the user.
