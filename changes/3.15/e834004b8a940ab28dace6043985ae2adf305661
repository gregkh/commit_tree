Bluetooth: Remove Simultaneous LE & BR/EDR flags from AD

Starting with the 4.1 Core Specification these flags are no longer used
and should always be cleared. From volume 3, part C, section 13.1.1:

"The 'Simultaneous LE and BR/EDR to Same Device Capable (Controller)'
and ‘Simultaneous LE and BR/EDR to Same Device Capable (Host)’ bits in
the Flags AD type shall be set to ‘0’."
