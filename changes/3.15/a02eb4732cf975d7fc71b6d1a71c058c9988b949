xen-netback: worse-case estimate in xenvif_rx_action is underestimating

The worse-case estimate for skb ring slot usage in xenvif_rx_action()
fails to take fragment page_offset into account. The page_offset does,
however, affect the number of times the fragmentation code calls
start_new_rx_buffer() (i.e. consume another slot) and the worse-case
should assume that will always return true. This patch adds the page_offset
into the DIV_ROUND_UP for each frag.

Unfortunately some frontends aggressively limit the number of requests
they post into the shared ring so to avoid an estimate that is 'too'
pessimal it is capped at MAX_SKB_FRAGS.
