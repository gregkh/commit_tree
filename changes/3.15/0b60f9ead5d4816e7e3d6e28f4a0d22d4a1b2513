s390: use device_remove_file_self() instead of device_schedule_callback()

driver-core now supports synchrnous self-deletion of attributes and
the asynchrnous removal mechanism is scheduled for removal.  Use it
instead of device_schedule_callback().

* Conversions in arch/s390/pci/pci_sysfs.c and
  drivers/s390/block/dcssblk.c are straightforward.

* drivers/s390/cio/ccwgroup.c is a bit more tricky because
  ccwgroup_notifier() was (ab)using device_schedule_callback() to
  purely obtain a process context to kick off ungroup operation which
  may block from a notifier callback.

  Rename ccwgroup_ungroup_callback() to ccwgroup_ungroup() and make it
  take ccwgroup_device * instead.  The new function is now called
  directly from ccwgroup_ungroup_store().

  ccwgroup_notifier() chain is updated to explicitly bounce through
  ccwgroup_device->ungroup_work.  This also removes possible failure
  from memory pressure.

Only compile-tested.
