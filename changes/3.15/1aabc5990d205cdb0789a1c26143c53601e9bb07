x86: Fix dumpstack_64 to keep state of "used" variable in loop

Commit 2223f6f6eeaa "x86: Clean up dumpstack_64.c code" moved the used
variable to a local within the loop, but the in_exception_stack()
depended on being non-volatile with the ability to change it.

By always re-initializing the "used" variable to zero, it would cause
the in_exception_stack() to return the same thing each time, and
cause the dump_stack loop to go into an infinite loop.
