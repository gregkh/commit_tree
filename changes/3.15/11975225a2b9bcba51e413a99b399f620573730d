Staging: comedi: addi-data: cleanup comments in hwdrv_apci1564.c

hwdrv_apci1564.c had a lot of commented out conditional statements that
were often identical to other un-commented out statements nearby, so it
should be safe to just delete all of these commented out lines.  This
patch also converts the remaining comments to the preferred kernel style
for comments.
