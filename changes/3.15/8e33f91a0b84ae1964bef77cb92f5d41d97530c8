clk: shmobile: clk-mstp: change to using clock-indices

With the addition of clock-indices, we need to change the renesas
clock implementation to use these instead of the local definition
of "renesas,clock-indices".

Since this will break booting with older device trees, we add a
simple auto-detection of which properties are present.
