ftrace: Warn on error when modifying ftrace function

We should print some warning and kill ftrace functionality when the ftrace
function is not set correctly. Otherwise, ftrace might do crazy things without
an explanation. The error value has been ignored so far.

Note that an error that happens during updating all the traced calls is handled
in ftrace_replace_code(). We print more details about the particular
failing address via ftrace_bug() there.
