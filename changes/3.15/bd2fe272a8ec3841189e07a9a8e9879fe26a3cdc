drivers/tty/serial: deal with 8250_core.c uninitialized warning for good

Every couple of months, someone sends a patch to fix:

drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c: In function 'serial_unlink_irq_chain':
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c:1712:2: warning: 'i' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]

and they in turn get a NACK for their efforts, and are told that
their compiler is broken.  This has been going on since at least
the year 2008:  https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/24/433

Lets add a comment, so that subsequent patches don't get as far as
the maintainers or the mailing lists.
