tipc: remove active flag from tipc_bearer structure

After the allocation of tipc_bearer structure instance is converted
from statical way to dynamical way, we identify whether a certain
tipc_bearer structure pointer is valid by checking whether the pointer
is NULL or not. So the active flag in tipc_bearer structure becomes
redundant.
