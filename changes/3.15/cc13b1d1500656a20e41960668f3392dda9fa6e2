md/raid10: call wait_barrier() for each request submitted.

wait_barrier() includes a counter, so we must call it precisely once
(unless balanced by allow_barrier()) for each request submitted.

Since
commit 20d0189b1012a37d2533a87fb451f7852f2418d1
    block: Introduce new bio_split()
in 3.14-rc1, we don't call it for the extra requests generated when
we need to split a bio.

When this happens the counter goes negative, any resync/recovery will
never start, and  "mdadm --stop" will hang.
