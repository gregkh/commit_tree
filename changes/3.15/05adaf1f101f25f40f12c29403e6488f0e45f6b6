drm/i915/vlv: reset VLV media force wake request register

Media force wake get hangs the machine when the system is booted without
displays attached. The assumption is that (at least some versions of)
the firmware has skipped some initialization in that case.

Empirical evidence suggests we need to reset the media force wake
request register in addition to the render one to avoid hangs.
