fbdev: move fbdev core files to separate directory

Instead of having fbdev framework core files at the root fbdev
directory, mixed with random fbdev device drivers, move the fbdev core
files to a separate core directory. This makes it much clearer which of
the files are actually part of the fbdev framework, and which are part
of device drivers.
