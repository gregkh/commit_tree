module: remove MODULE_GENERIC_TABLE

MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() calles MODULE_GENERIC_TABLE(); make it do the
work directly.  This also removes a wart introduced in the last patch,
where the alias is defined to be an unknown struct type "struct
type##__##name##_device_id" instead of "struct type##_device_id" (it's
an extern so GCC doesn't care, but it's wrong).

The other user of MODULE_GENERIC_TABLE (ISAPNP_CARD_TABLE) is unused,
so delete it.
