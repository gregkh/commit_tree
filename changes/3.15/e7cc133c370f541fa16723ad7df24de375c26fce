fuse: Flush files on wb close

Any write request requires a file handle to report to the userspace. Thus
when we close a file (and free the fuse_file with this info) we have to
flush all the outstanding dirty pages.

filemap_write_and_wait() is enough because every page under fuse writeback
is accounted in ff->count. This delays actual close until all fuse wb is
completed.

In case of "write cache" turned off, the flush is ensured by fuse_vma_close().
