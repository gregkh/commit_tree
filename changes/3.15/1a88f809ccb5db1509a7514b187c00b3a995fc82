ARM: mvebu: fix NOR bus-width in Armada XP GP Device Tree

The mvebu-devbus driver had a serious bug, which lead to a 8 bits bus
width declared in the Device Tree being considered as a 16 bits bus
width when configuring the hardware.

This bug in mvebu-devbus driver was compensated by a symetric mistake
in the Armada XP GP Device Tree: a 8 bits bus width was declared, even
though the hardware actually has a 16 bits bus width connection with
the NOR flash.

Now that we have fixed the mvebu-devbus driver to behave according to
its Device Tree binding, this commit fixes the problematic Device Tree
files as well.

This bug was introduced in commit
da8d1b38356853c37116f9afa29f15648d7fb159 ('ARM: mvebu: Add support for
NOR flash device on Armada XP-GP board') which was merged in v3.10.
