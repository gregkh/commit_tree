HID: input: hid-input remove hid_output_raw_report call

hid_output_raw_report() is not a ll_driver callback and should not be used.
To keep the same code path than before, we are forced to play with the
different hid_hw_* calls: if the usb or i2c device does not support
direct output reports, then we will rely on the SET_REPORT HID call.
