cgroup: fix the retry path of cgroup_mount()

If we hit the retry path, we'll call parse_cgroupfs_options() again,
but the string we pass to it has been modified by the previous call
to this function.

This bug can be observed by:

  # mount -t cgroup -o name=foo,cpuset xxx /mnt && umount /mnt && \
    mount -t cgroup -o name=foo,cpuset xxx /mnt
  mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on xxx,
         missing codepage or helper program, or other error
  ...

The second mount passed "name=foo,cpuset" to the parser, and then it
hit the retry path and call the parser again, but this time the string
passed to the parser is "name=foo".

To fix this, we avoid calling parse_cgroupfs_options() again in this
case.
