x86/boot: Fix non-EFI build

The kbuild test robot reported the following errors, introduced with
commit 54b52d872680 ("x86/efi: Build our own EFI services pointer
table"),

 arch/x86/boot/compressed/head_32.o: In function `efi32_config':
>> (.data+0x58): undefined reference to `efi_call_phys'

 arch/x86/boot/compressed/head_64.o: In function `efi64_config':
>> (.data+0x90): undefined reference to `efi_call6'

Wrap the efi*_config structures in #ifdef CONFIG_EFI_STUB so that we
don't make references to EFI functions if they're not compiled in.
