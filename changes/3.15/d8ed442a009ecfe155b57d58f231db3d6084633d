arm64: enable processor debug state for secondary cpus

processor debug state PSTATE.D is unmasked in smp call
clear_os_lock for secondary cpus. So debug state is still
masked in normal kernel context.  With this patch, unmask
debug state on secondary boot for the cpus in normal kernel
context. Now kgdb tests passed with multicore.
