Bluetooth: Enable support for remote IRK distribution

This patch does the necessary changes to request the remote device to
distribute its IRK to us during the SMP pairing procedure. This includes
setting the right key distribution values in the pairing
request/response and handling of the two related SMP PDUs, i.e. Identity
Information and Identity Address Information.
