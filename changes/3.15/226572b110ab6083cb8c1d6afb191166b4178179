vme_tsi148: Fix PCI address mapping assumption

Previously, tsi148_master_set() assumed the address contained in its
PCI bus resource represented the actual PCI bus address. This is a fine
assumption on some platforms. However, on platforms that don't use a
1:1 (CPU:PCI) mapping this results in the tsi148 driver configuring an
invalid master window translation.

This patch updates the vme_tsi148 driver to first convert the address
contained in the PCI bus resource into a PCI bus address before using
it.
