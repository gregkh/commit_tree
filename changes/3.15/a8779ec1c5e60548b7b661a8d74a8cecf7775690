    netpoll: use GFP_ATOMIC in slave_enable_netpoll() and __netpoll_setup()

    slave_enable_netpoll() and __netpoll_setup() may be called
    with read_lock() held, so should use GFP_ATOMIC to allocate
    memory. Eric suggested to pass gfp flags to __netpoll_setup().

    bonding: don't call slave_xxx_netpoll under spinlocks

    The slave_xxx_netpoll will call synchronize_rcu_bh(),
    so the function may schedule and sleep, it should't be
    called under spinlocks.

    bond_netpoll_setup() and bond_netpoll_cleanup() are always
    protected by rtnl lock, it is no need to take the read lock,
    as the slave list couldn't be changed outside rtnl lock.

Nothing else that calls __netpoll_setup or ndo_netpoll_setup
requires a gfp paramter, so remove the gfp parameter from both
of these functions making the code clearer.
