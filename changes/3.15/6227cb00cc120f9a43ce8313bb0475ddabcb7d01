sched: Use CPUPRI_NR_PRIORITIES instead of MAX_RT_PRIO in cpupri check

The check at the beginning of cpupri_find() makes sure that the task_pri
variable does not exceed the cp->pri_to_cpu array length. But that length
is CPUPRI_NR_PRIORITIES not MAX_RT_PRIO, where it will miss the last two
priorities in that array.

As task_pri is computed from convert_prio() which should never be bigger
than CPUPRI_NR_PRIORITIES, if the check should cause a panic if it is
hit.
