MCE, AMD: Fix decoding module loading on unsupported hw

We want to still be able to issue some error information on systems for
which there is no decoding support (think older distro kernels here,
for example). Therefore, we allow module registration but skip the
per-family bank-specific decoders and issue the general information
only, i.e.:

[   46.822828] [Hardware Error]: Error Status: Uncorrected, software containable error.
[   46.822846] [Hardware Error]: CPU:0 (15:30:0) MC0_STATUS[-|UE|-|-|-|-|-]: 0xa000000000010f0f
[   46.822858] [Hardware Error]: cache level: L3/GEN, mem/io: GEN, mem-tx: GEN, part-proc: GEN (timed out)

with the hope that it still contains helpful useful bits.
