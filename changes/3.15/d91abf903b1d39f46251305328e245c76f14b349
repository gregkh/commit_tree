qlcnic: Updates to QLogic application/driver interface for virtual NIC configuration

Qlogic application interface in the driver which has larger than 8 vNIC
configuration support has been updated to handle the following cases:

o Only 8 or lower total vNICs were enabled within the vNIC 0-7 range
o vNICs were enabled in the vNIC 0-15 range such that enabled vNICs were
  not contiguous and only 8 or lower number of total VNICs were enabled
o Disconnect in the vNIC mapping between application and driver when the
  enabled VNICs were dis contiguous
