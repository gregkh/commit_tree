perf tools: Adjust symbols in VDSO

pert-report doesn't resolve function names in VDSO:

$ perf report --stdio -g flat,0.0,15,callee --sort pid
...
            8.76%
               0x7fff6b1fe861
               __gettimeofday
               ACE_OS::gettimeofday()
...

In this case symbol values should be adjusted the same way as for executables,
relocatable objects and prelinked libraries.

After fix:

$ perf report --stdio -g flat,0.0,15,callee --sort pid
...
            8.76%
               __vdso_gettimeofday
               __gettimeofday
               ACE_OS::gettimeofday()
