Revert "sysfs, driver-core: remove unused {sysfs|device}_schedule_callback_owner()"

This reverts commit d1ba277e79889085a2faec3b68b91ce89c63f888.

As reported by Stephen, this patch breaks linux-next as a ppc patch
suddenly (after 2 years) started using this old api call.  So revert it
for now, it will go away in 3.15-rc2 when we can change the PPC call to
the new api.
