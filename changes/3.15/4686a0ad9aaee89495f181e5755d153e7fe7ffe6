ASoC: rsnd: remove SSI dependent DMAEngine callback

Renesas Gen2 sound will use 2 DMAC
which are Audio-DMAC, and Audio-DMAC-peri-peri.
Current driver has callback function for each DMAC,
because it assumed each DMAC needs special settings.
But it became clear that these can share settings.
This patch removes unnecessary callback
