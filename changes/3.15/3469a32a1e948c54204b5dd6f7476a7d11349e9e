jbd2: don't hold j_state_lock while calling wake_up()

The j_state_lock is one of the hottest locks in the jbd2 layer and
thus one of its scalability bottlenecks.

We don't need to be holding the j_state_lock while we are calling
wake_up(&journal->j_wait_commit), so release the lock a little bit
earlier.
