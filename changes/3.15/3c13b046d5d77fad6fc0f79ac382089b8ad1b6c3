Staging: bcm: CmHost: moved and removed declarations and tmp bracing.

Firstly, some background is needed to confirm the validity of
this patch as error fixing. It seems the developer when writing
this driver from scratch, used what are known to me as error
suppressors in the form of extra tmp bracing added to the case labels.
They aid during construction time, but are not intended to remain.

In this scenario there are declarations occupying space only
reserved for statements. If these tmp braces were to be removed
before the declarations in question were reassigned to there
proper place in the funtion, compile time errors would result.

So, having that said, I moved the declarations,
UINT uiSearchRuleIndex = 0; and ULONG ulSFID;,
and also deleted the duplicates thereof from
the switch/case statement.

Removed temporary bracing from case labels.

Removed new lines as needed.

Properly indented case breaks.

Added /* FALLTHROUGH */ comments to switch/case.
