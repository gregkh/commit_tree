batman-adv: Add IPv4 link-local/IPv6-ll-all-nodes multicast support

With this patch a node may additionally perform the dropping or
unicasting behaviour for a link-local IPv4 and link-local-all-nodes
IPv6 multicast packet, too.

The extra counter and BATADV_MCAST_WANT_ALL_UNSNOOPABLES flag is needed
because with a future bridge snooping support integration a node with a
bridge on top of its soft interface is not able to reliably detect its
multicast listeners for IPv4 link-local and the IPv6
link-local-all-nodes addresses anymore (see RFC4541, section 2.1.2.2
and section 3).

Even though this new flag does make "no difference" now, it'll ensure
a seamless integration of multicast bridge support without needing to
break compatibility later.

Also note, that even with multicast bridge support it won't be possible
to optimize 224.0.0.x and ff02::1 towards nodes with bridges, they will
always receive these ranges.
