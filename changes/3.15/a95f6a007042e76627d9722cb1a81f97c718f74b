drm/i915: Switch to fake context on older gens

We used to have per file descriptor hang stats for the
i915_get_reset_stats_ioctl() and for default context banning.

    drm/i915: Create a per file_priv default context

made having separate hangstats in file_private redundant
as i915_hw_context already contained hangstats. So

    drm/i915: Piggy back hangstats off of contexts

consolidated the hangstats and enabled further improvements.

    drm/i915: Use i915_hw_context to set reset stats

tried to reap full benefits of consolidation but fell short
as we never 'switch' to the fake private context on gens
that don't have hw_contexts, so request->ctx remained NULL
on those.

Fix this by 'switching' to fake context so that when
request is submitted to ring, proper context gets assigned
to it.
