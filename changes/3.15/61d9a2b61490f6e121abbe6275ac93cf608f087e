[SCSI] qla4xxx: Fix pending IO completion in reset path before initiating chip reset

Issue:
Pending IO wait does not complete after triggering Graceful reset,
causing ack timeout and call traces.

Fix:
1. Reducing the IO command wait timeout before triggering reset,
   as logically also timeout should be less than reset timeout (10sec).
2. Moving the abort IO after chip reset, because only after
   chip reset, driver owns the IO otherwise it is with firmware and can
   still revert back with response.
