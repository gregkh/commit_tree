lib/random32.c: minor cleanups and kdoc fix

These are just some very minor and misc cleanups in the PRNG.  In
prandom_u32() we store the result in an unsigned long which is
unnecessary as it should be u32 instead that we get from
prandom_u32_state().  prandom_bytes_state()'s comment is in kdoc format,
so change it into such as it's done everywhere else.  Also, use the
normal comment style for the header comment.  Last but not least for
readability, add some newlines.
