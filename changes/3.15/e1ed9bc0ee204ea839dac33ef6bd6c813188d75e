sysfs: create bin_attributes under the requested group

bin_attributes created/updated in create_files() (such as those listed
via (struct device).attribute_groups) were not placed under the
specified group, and instead appeared in the base kobj directory.

Fix this by making bin_attributes use creating code similar to normal
attributes.

A quick grep shows that no one is using bin_attrs in a named attribute
group yet, so we can do this without breaking anything in usespace.

Note that I do not add is_visible() support to
bin_attributes, though that could be done as well.

This is a copy of the patch already merged in Greg's tree.
