hwmon: (emc1403) Fix resource leak on module unload

Commit 454aee17f claims to convert driver emc1403 to use
devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups, however the patch itself makes
use of hwmon_device_register_with_groups instead. As the driver remove
function was still dropped, the hwmon device is no longer unregistered
on driver removal, leading to a resource leak.
