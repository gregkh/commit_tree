ath10k: skip management frames in HTT path

After we pass frames with INV_PEER to upper layer in commit 716ae53c56cf
("ath10k: pass frames with invalid peer status to upper layer") we could pass
some management frames (in case INVALID_PEER and MGMT_CTRL) twice to upper
layer, once via WMI and once via HTT. Next we could handle assoc request twice.
This patch remove such regression.
