Bluetooth: Fix write_room() calculation

The skb truesize of a 12-byte payload with a 10-byte head/tail
reserve is 768 bytes. Consequently, even with 40 tx_credits, at
most 6 packets could be queued at any one time:

  40 tx_credits * 127-byte mtu < 768-byte truesize * 7

This error could also cause the tx queue to apparently stall if
credit flow control is disabled (where tx_credits is fixed at 5),
or if the receiver only granted a limited number of tx credits
(eg., less than 7).

Instead, track the outstanding number of queued packets not yet sent
in wmem_alloc and allow for a maximum of 40 queued packets. Report
the space avail for a single write() as the mtu * number of packets
left before reaching the maximum.
