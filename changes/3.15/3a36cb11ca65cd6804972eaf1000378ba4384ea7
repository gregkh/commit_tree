ftrace: Do not pass data to ftrace_dyn_arch_init

As the data parameter is not really used by any ftrace_dyn_arch_init,
remove that from ftrace_dyn_arch_init. This also removes the addr
local variable from ftrace_init which is now unused.

Note the documentation was imprecise as it did not suggest to set
(*data) to 0.
