gpio: add IRQ chip helpers in gpiolib

This provides a function gpiochip_irqchip_add() to set
up an irqchip for a GPIO controller, and a function
gpiochip_set_chained_irqchip() to chain it to a parent
irqchip.

Most GPIOs are of the type where a number of lines form
a cascaded interrupt controller chained onto
the primary system interrupt controller (or further down the
chain) so let's add this helper and factor the code to
request the lines to be used as IRQs, the .to_irq() function
and the irqdomain into the core as well.
