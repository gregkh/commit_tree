ARM: samsung: select CRC32 for SAMSUNG_PM_CHECK

The Samsung pm_check code uses the crc32 library code, which can
be built as a loadable module, in which case we get a link error
building the kernel.

A better solution is to use 'select CRC32', which is what all
other users of this code do, as it ensures it is always built-in.
