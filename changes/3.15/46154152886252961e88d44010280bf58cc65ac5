drm/exynos: set the active aspect ratio as per mode

Now that the drm_display_mode also provides aspect
ratio for all resolutions, this patch adds its usage
to set the active aspect ratio of AVI info frame
packets as per CEA-861-D standard's Table 9.

This is also needed to abide by the 7-27
compliance test of HDMI.
