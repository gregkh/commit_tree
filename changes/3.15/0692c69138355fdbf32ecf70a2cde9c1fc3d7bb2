cpufreq: powernv: Use cpufreq_frequency_table.driver_data to store pstate ids

The .driver_data field in the cpufreq_frequency_table was supposed to
be private to the drivers. However at some later point, it was being
used to indicate if the particular frequency in the table is the
BOOST_FREQUENCY. After patches [1] and [2], the .driver_data is once
again private to the driver. Thus we can safely use
cpufreq_frequency_table.driver_data to store pstate_ids instead of
having to maintain a separate array powernv_pstate_ids[] for this
purpose.
