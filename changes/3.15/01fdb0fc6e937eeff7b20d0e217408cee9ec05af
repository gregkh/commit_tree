Bluetooth: Report identity address when remote device connects

When the remote device has been successfully connected, report the
identity address (public address or static random address).

Currently the address from the HCI_LE_Connection_Complete event is
used. This was no problem so far, but since now known resolvable
random addresses are converted into identities, it is important to
use the identity of the connection and not the address report by
HCI event.
