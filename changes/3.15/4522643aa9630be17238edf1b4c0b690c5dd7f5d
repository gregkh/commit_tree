HID: uhid: Add UHID_CREATE2 + UHID_INPUT2

UHID_CREATE2:
HID report descriptor data (rd_data) is an array in struct uhid_create2_req,
instead of a pointer. Enables use from languages that don't support pointers,
e.g. Python.

UHID_INPUT2:
Data array is the last field of struct uhid_input2_req. Enables userspace to
write only the required bytes to kernel (ev.type + ev.u.input2.size + the part
of the data array that matters), instead of the entire struct uhid_input2_req.

Note:
UHID_CREATE2 increases the total size of struct uhid_event slightly, thus
increasing the size of messages that are queued for userspace. However, this
won't affect the userspace processing of these events.
