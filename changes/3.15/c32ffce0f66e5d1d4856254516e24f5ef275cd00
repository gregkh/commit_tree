ARM: 7984/1: prefetch: add prefetchw invocations for barriered atomics

After a bunch of benchmarking on the interaction between dmb and pldw,
it turns out that issuing the pldw *after* the dmb instruction can
give modest performance gains (~3% atomic_add_return improvement on a
dual A15).

This patch adds prefetchw invocations to our barriered atomic operations
including cmpxchg, test_and_xxx and futexes.
