staging: luster: do not combine value 0 with |

There is no point in combining a variable
that is 0 with other things with |

The semantic patch used:

@@
expression x,e,e1;
statement S;
@@

if (x == 0) {
 <... when != x = e1
      when != while(...) S
      when != for(...;...;...) S

-  x |= e
+  x  = e
  ...>
}
