Bluetooth: allocate static minor for vhci

Commit bfacbb9 (Bluetooth: Use devname:vhci module alias for virtual HCI
driver) added the module alias to hci_vhci module so it's possible to
create the /dev/vhci node. However creating an alias without
specifying the minor doesn't allow us to create the node ahead,
triggerring module auto-load when it's first accessed.

Starting with depmod from kmod 16 we started to warn if there's a
devname alias without specifying the major and minor.

Let's do the same done for uhid, kvm, fuse and others, specifying a
fixed minor. In systems with systemd as the init the following will
happen: on early boot systemd will call "kmod static-nodes" to read
/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.devname and then create the nodes. When
first accessed these "dead" nodes will trigger the module loading.
