ath10k: do not overwrite max_antenna_gain

Seems like we have an old bug, where we incidently overwrites
the max_antenna_gain we pass to firmware, with zero value.

End of all we are artifically reducing the output power.

This patch removes the excessive assignment on max_antenna_gain,
which is being provided by regulatory domain, and consequently
improves the tx power.
