bcache: remove nested function usage

Uninlined nested functions can cause crashes when using ftrace, as they don't
follow the normal calling convention and confuse the ftrace function graph
tracer as it examines the stack.

Also, nested functions are supported as a gcc extension, but may fail on other
compilers (e.g. llvm).
