MIPS: Fix branch emulation of branch likely instructions.

Two issues:

  o For beql_op, beql_op, bne_op, bnel_op, blez_op, blezl_op, bgtz_op and
    bgtzl_op the wrong field was being checked for the instruction opcode.
  o For blez_op / blezl_op and bgtz_op / bgtzl_op the test was testing
    for the wrong opcode.

This bug got introduced by d8d4e3ae0b5c179c0bfd3f0af5b352d13bea9cfa [MIPS
Kprobes: Refactor branch emulation].
