bnx2x: Remove the sriov VFOP mechanism

Since we now posses a workqueue dedicated for sriov, the paradigm that sriov-
related tasks cannot sleep is no longer correct.

The VFOP mechanism was the one previously supporting said paradigm - the sriov
related tasks were broken into segments which did not require sleep, and the
mechanism re-scheduled the next segment whenever possible.

This patch remvoes the VFOP mechanism altogether - the resulting code is a much
easier to follow code; The segments are gathered into straight-forward
functions which sleep whenever neccessary.
