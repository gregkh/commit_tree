MIPS: lib: csum_partial: Merge EXC and load/store macros

Each load/store macro always adds an entry to the __ex_table
using the EXC macro. There are cases where a load instruction may
never fail such as when we are sure the load happens in the kernel
address space. Therefore, we merge these the EXC and LOADX/STOREX
macros into a single one. We also expand the argument list in the EXC
macro to make the macro more flexible. The extra 'type' argument is not
used by this commit, but it will be used when EVA support is added to
memcpy.
