[media] gspca_kinect: fix kinect_read() error path

The error checking code relative to the invocations of kinect_read()
does not return the actual return code of the function just called, it
returns "res" which still contains the value of the last invocation of
a previous kinect_write().

Return the proper value, and while at it also report with -EREMOTEIO the
case of a partial transfer.
