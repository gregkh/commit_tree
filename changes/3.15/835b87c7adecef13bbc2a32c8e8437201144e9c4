[media] v4l: reorganize RF tuner control ID numbers

It appears that controls are ordered by ID number when enumerating.
That could lead illogical UI as controls are usually enumerated and
drawn by the application at runtime.

Change order of controls by reorganizing assigned IDs now as we can.
It is not reasonable possible after the API is released. Also, leave
some spare space between IDs too for possible future extensions.
