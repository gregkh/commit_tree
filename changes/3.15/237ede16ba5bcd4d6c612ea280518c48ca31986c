cpufreq: powernow-k6: Fix incorrect comparison with max_multipler

The value of 'max_multiplier' is meant to be used for comparison with
clock_ratio[index].driver_data, not the index itself! Fix the code in
powernow_k6_cpu_exit() that has this bug.

Also, while at it, make the for-loop condition look for CPUFREQ_TABLE_END,
instead of hard-coding the loop count to 8.
