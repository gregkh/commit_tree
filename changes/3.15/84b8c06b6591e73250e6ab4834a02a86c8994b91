drbd: Create a dedicated struct drbd_device_work

drbd_device_work is a work item that has a reference to a device,
while drbd_work is a more generic work item that does not carry
a reference to a device.

All callbacks get a pointer to a drbd_work instance, those callbacks
that expect a drbd_device_work use the container_of macro to get it.
