crush: add chooseleaf_vary_r tunable

The current crush_choose_firstn code will re-use the same 'r' value for
the recursive call.  That means that if we are hitting a collision or
rejection for some reason (say, an OSD that is marked out) and need to
retry, we will keep making the same (bad) choice in that recursive
selection.

Introduce a tunable that fixes that behavior by incorporating the parent
'r' value into the recursive starting point, so that a different path
will be taken in subsequent placement attempts.

Note that this was done from the get-go for the new crush_choose_indep
algorithm.

This was exposed by a user who was seeing PGs stuck in active+remapped
after reweight-by-utilization because the up set mapped to a single OSD.

Reflects ceph.git commit a8e6c9fbf88bad056dd05d3eb790e98a5e43451a.
