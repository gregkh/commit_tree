DRM: armada: fix corruption while loading cursors

Loading cursors to the LCD controller's SRAM can be corrupted when the
configured pixel clock is relatively slow.  This seems to be caused
when we write back-to-back to the SRAM registers.

There doesn't appear to be any status register we can read to check
when an access has completed.

Inserting a dummy read between the writes appears to fix the problem.
