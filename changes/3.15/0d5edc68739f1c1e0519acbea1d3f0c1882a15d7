ipv4, route: pass 0 instead of LOOPBACK_IFINDEX to fib_validate_source()

In my special case, when a packet is redirected from veth0 to lo,
its skb->dev->ifindex would be LOOPBACK_IFINDEX. Meanwhile we
pass the hard-coded LOOPBACK_IFINDEX to fib_validate_source()
in ip_route_input_slow(). This would cause the following check
in fib_validate_source() fail:

            (dev->ifindex != oif || !IN_DEV_TX_REDIRECTS(idev))

when rp_filter is disabeld on loopback. As suggested by Julian,
the caller should pass 0 here so that we will not end up by
calling __fib_validate_source().
