KVM: x86: Remove return code from enable_irq/nmi_window

It's no longer possible to enter enable_irq_window in guest mode when
L1 intercepts external interrupts and we are entering L2. This is now
caught in vcpu_enter_guest. So we can remove the check from the VMX
version of enable_irq_window, thus the need to return an error code from
both enable_irq_window and enable_nmi_window.
