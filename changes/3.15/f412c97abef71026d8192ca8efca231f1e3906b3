mm, hugetlb: mark some bootstrap functions as __init

Both prep_compound_huge_page() and prep_compound_gigantic_page() are
only called at bootstrap and can be marked as __init.

The __SetPageTail(page) in prep_compound_gigantic_page() happening
before page->first_page is initialized is not concerning since this is
bootstrap.
