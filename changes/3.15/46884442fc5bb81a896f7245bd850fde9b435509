random: use the architectural HWRNG for the SHA's IV in extract_buf()

To help assuage the fears of those who think the NSA can introduce a
massive hack into the instruction decode and out of order execution
engine in the CPU without hundreds of Intel engineers knowing about
it (only one of which woud need to have the conscience and courage of
Edward Snowden to spill the beans to the public), use the HWRNG to
initialize the SHA starting value, instead of xor'ing it in
afterwards.
