usb: musb: fix PHY power on/off

commi 30a70b0 (usb: musb: fix obex in g_nokia.ko
causing kernel panic) removed phy_power_on()
and phy_power_off() calls from runtime PM callbacks
but it failed to note that the driver depended
on pm_runtime_get_sync() calls to power up the PHY,
thus leaving some platforms without any means to
have a working PHY.

Fix that by enabling the phy during omap2430_musb_init()
and killing it in omap2430_musb_exit().
