bonding: extend arp_validate to be able to receive unvalidated arp-only traffic

Currently we can either receive any traffic as a proff of slave being up,
or only *validated* arp traffic (i.e. with src/dst ip checked).

Add an option to be able to specify if we want to receive non-validated arp
traffic only.
