net: phy: add minimal support for QSGMII PHY

This commit adds the necessary definitions for the PHY layer to
recognize "qsgmii" as a valid PHY interface. A QSMII interface, as
defined at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Independent_Interface#Quad_Serial_Gigabit_Media_Independent_Interface,
is "is a method of combining four SGMII lines into a 5Gbit/s
interface. QSGMII, like SGMII, uses LVDS signalling for the TX and RX
data and a single LVDS clock signal. QSGMII uses significantly fewer
signal lines than four SGMII busses."

This type of MAC <-> PHY connection might require special handling on
the MAC driver side, so it should be possible to express this type of
MAC <-> PHY connection, for example in the Device Tree.
