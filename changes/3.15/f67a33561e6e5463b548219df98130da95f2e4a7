rcutorture: Abstract torture_shutdown_absorb()

Because handling races between rmmod and normal shutdown is not specific
to rcutorture, this commit renames rcutorture_shutdown_absorb() to
torture_shutdown_absorb() and pulls it out into then kernel/torture.c
module.  This implies pulling the fullstop mechanism into kernel/torture.c
as well.

The exporting of fullstop and fullstop_mutex is ugly and must die.
And it does in fact die in later commits that introduce higher-level
APIs that encapsulate both of these variables.
