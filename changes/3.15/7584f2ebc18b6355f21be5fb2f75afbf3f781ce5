usb: wusbcore: convert nested lock to use spin_lock instead of spin_lock_irq

Nesting a spin_lock_irq/unlock_irq inside a lock that has already
disabled interrupts will enable interrupts before we are ready when
spin_unlock_irq is called.  This patch converts the inner lock to use
spin_lock and spin_unlock instead.
