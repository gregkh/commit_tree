KVM: nVMX: Rework interception of IRQs and NMIs

Move the check for leaving L2 on pending and intercepted IRQs or NMIs
from the *_allowed handler into a dedicated callback. Invoke this
callback at the relevant points before KVM checks if IRQs/NMIs can be
injected. The callback has the task to switch from L2 to L1 if needed
and inject the proper vmexit events.

The rework fixes L2 wakeups from HLT and provides the foundation for
preemption timer emulation.
