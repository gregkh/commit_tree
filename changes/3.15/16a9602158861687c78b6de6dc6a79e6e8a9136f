KVM: x86: disable master clock if TSC is reset during suspend

Updating system_time from the kernel clock once master clock
has been enabled can result in time backwards event, in case
kernel clock frequency is lower than TSC frequency.

Disable master clock in case it is necessary to update it
from the resume path.
