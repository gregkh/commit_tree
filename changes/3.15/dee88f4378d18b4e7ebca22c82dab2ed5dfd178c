[media] nuvoton-cir: Don't touch PS/2 interrupts while initializing

There are reports[1] that on some motherboards loading the nuvoton-cir
disables PS/2 keyboard input. This is caused by an erroneous write of
CIR_INTR_MOUSE_IRQ_BIT to ACPI control register.

According to datasheet the write enables mouse power management event
interrupts which will probably have ill effects if the motherboard has
only one PS/2 port with keyboard in it.

The cir hardware does not need mouse interrupts to function and should
not touch them. This patch removes the illegal writes and registry
definitions.
