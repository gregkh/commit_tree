x86, efi: Abstract x86 efi_early calls

The ARM EFI boot stub doesn't need to care about the efi_early
infrastructure that x86 requires in order to do mixed mode thunking. So
wrap everything up in an efi_call_early() macro.

This allows x86 to do the necessary indirection jumps to call whatever
firmware interface is necessary (native or mixed mode), but also allows
the ARM folks to mask the fact that they don't support relocation in the
boot stub and need to pass 'sys_table_arg' to every function.
