btrfs: replace error code from btrfs_drop_extents

There's a case which clone does not handle and used to BUG_ON instead,
(testcase xfstests/btrfs/035), now returns EINVAL. This error code is
confusing to the ioctl caller, as it normally signifies errorneous
arguments.

Change it to ENOPNOTSUPP which allows a fall back to copy instead of
clone. This does not affect the common reflink operation.
