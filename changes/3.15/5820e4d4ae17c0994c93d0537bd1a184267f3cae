HID: Add some missing HUT mappings

Add mapping for "AL Next Task/Application", "AL Previous Task/Application"
and "AL File Browser" buttons, as found on the Microsoft Office keyboard.

Note that there already is a mapping for "AL Local Machine Browser" to
KEY_FILE. Unless we ever encounter a device with both that should not be
a problem.
