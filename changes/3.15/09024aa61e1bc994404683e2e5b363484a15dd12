arm64: Fix the soft_restart routine

Change the soft_restart() routine to call cpu_reset() at its identity mapped
physical address.

The cpu_reset() routine must be called at its identity mapped physical address
so that when the MMU is turned off the instruction pointer will be at the correct
location in physical memory.
