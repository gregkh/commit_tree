ipv6: yet another new IPV6_MTU_DISCOVER option IPV6_PMTUDISC_OMIT

This option has the same semantic as IP_PMTUDISC_OMIT for IPv4 which
got recently introduced. It doesn't honor the path mtu discovered by the
host but in contrary to IPV6_PMTUDISC_INTERFACE allows the generation of
fragments if the packet size exceeds the MTU of the outgoing interface
MTU.
