x86/efi: Rip out phys_efi_get_time()

Dan reported that phys_efi_get_time() is doing kmalloc(..., GFP_KERNEL)
under a spinlock which is very clearly a bug. Since phys_efi_get_time()
has no users let's just delete it instead of trying to fix it.

Note that since there are no users of phys_efi_get_time(), it is not
possible to actually trigger a GFP_KERNEL alloc under the spinlock.
