kernfs: invoke kernfs_unmap_bin_file() directly from kernfs_deactivate()

kernfs_unmap_bin_file() is supposed to unmap all memory mappings of
the target file before kernfs_remove() finishes; however, it currently
is being called from kernfs_addrm_finish() and has the same race
problem as the original implementation of deactivation when there are
multiple removers - only the remover which snatches the node to its
addrm_cxt->removed list is guaranteed to wait for its completion
before returning.

It can be easily fixed by moving kernfs_unmap_bin_file() invocation
from kernfs_addrm_finish() to kernfs_deactivated().  The function may
be called multiple times but that shouldn't do any harm.
