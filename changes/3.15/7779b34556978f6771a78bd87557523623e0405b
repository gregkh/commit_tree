gpio: add a driver for the Synopsys DesignWare APB GPIO block

The Synopsys DesignWare block is used in some ARM devices (picoxcell)
and can be configured to provide multiple banks of GPIO pins.

v12: - Add irq_startup/shutdown
     - do irq_create_mapping() in probe, irq_find_mapping() in to_irq()
     - Adjust mappings to show support for 1 gpio per port.
     - gpio-cells = <1>
v11: - Use NULL when checking existence of 'interrupts' property
     - Bindings descriptions cleanup
v10: - in documentation nr-gpio -> nr-gpios
v9:  - cleanup in dt bindings doc
     - use of_get_child_count()
v8:  - remove socfpga.dtsi changes
     - minor cleanup in devicetree documentation
v7:  - use irq_generic_chip
     - support one irq per gpio line or one irq for many
     - s/bank/port/ and other cleanup
v6:  - (atull) squash the set of patches
     - use linear irq domain
     - build fixes. Original driver was reviewed on v3.2.
     - Fix setting irq edge type for 'rising' and 'both'.
     - Support as a loadable module.
     - Use bgpio_chip's spinlock during register access.
     - Clean up register names to match spec
     - s/bank/port/ because register names use the word 'port'
     - s/nr-gpio/nr-gpios/
     - don't get/put the of_node
     - remove signoffs/acked-by's because of changes
     - other cleanup
v5:  - handle sparse bank population correctly
v3:  - depend on rather than select IRQ_DOMAIN
     - split IRQ support into a separate patch
v2:  - use Rob Herring's irqdomain in generic irq chip patches
     - use reg property to indicate bank index
     - support irqs on both edges based on LinusW's u300 driver
