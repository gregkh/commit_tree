mtd: nand: omap: ecc.correct: omap_elm_correct_data: fix erased-page detection for BCHx_HW ECC schemes

As erased-pages do not have ECC stored in their OOB area, so they need to be
seperated out from programmed-pages, before doing BCH ECC correction.

In current implementation of omap_elm_correct_data() which does ECC correction
for BCHx ECC schemes, this erased-pages are detected based on specific marker
byte (reserved as 0x00) in ecc-layout.
However, this approach has some limitation like;
 1) All ecc-scheme layouts do not have such Reserved byte marker to
    differentiate between erased-page v/s programmed-page. Thus this is a
    customized solution.
 2) Reserved marker byte can itself be subjected to bit-flips causing
    erased-page to be misunderstood as programmed-page.

This patch removes dependency on any marker byte in ecc-layout, instead it
compares calc_ecc[] with pattern of ECC-of-all(0xff). This implicitely
means that both 'data + oob == all(0xff).
