cpuidle/powernv: Add "Fast-Sleep" CPU idle state

Fast sleep is one of the deep idle states on Power8 in which local timers of
CPUs stop. On PowerPC we do not have an external clock device which can
handle wakeup of such CPUs. Now that we have the support in the tick broadcast
framework for archs that do not sport such a device and the low level support
for fast sleep, enable it in the cpuidle framework on PowerNV.
