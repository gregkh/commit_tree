arm64: Fix DMA range invalidation for cache line unaligned buffers

If the buffer needing cache invalidation for inbound DMA does start or
end on a cache line aligned address, we need to use the non-destructive
clean&invalidate operation. This issue was introduced by commit
7363590d2c46 (arm64: Implement coherent DMA API based on swiotlb).
