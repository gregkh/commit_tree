perf: Limit perf_event_attr::sample_period to 63 bits

Vince reported that using a large sample_period (one with bit 63 set)
results in wreckage since while the sample_period is fundamentally
unsigned (negative periods don't make sense) the way we implement
things very much rely on signed logic.

So limit sample_period to 63 bits to avoid tripping over this.
