cgroup: introduce cgroup_ino()

mm/memory-failure.c::hwpoison_filter_task() has been reaching into
cgroup to extract the associated ino to be used as a filtering
criterion.  This is an implementation detail which shouldn't be
depended upon from outside cgroup proper and is about to change with
the scheduled kernfs conversion.

This patch introduces a proper interface to determine the associated
ino, cgroup_ino(), and updates hwpoison_filter_task() to use it
instead of reaching directly into cgroup.
