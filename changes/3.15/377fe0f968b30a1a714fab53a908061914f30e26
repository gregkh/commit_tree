batman-adv: increase orig refcount when storing ref in gw_node

A pointer to the orig_node representing a bat-gateway is
stored in the gw_node->orig_node member, but the refcount
for such orig_node is never increased.
This leads to memory faults when gw_node->orig_node is accessed
and the originator has already been freed.

Fix this by increasing the refcount on gw_node creation
and decreasing it on gw_node free.
