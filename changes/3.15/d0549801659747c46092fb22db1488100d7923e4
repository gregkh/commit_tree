PM / wakeup: Correct presence vs. emptiness of wakeup_* attributes

According to the documentation, the various wakeup_* attributes in sysfs
are not present if the device is not enabled to wake up the system.

This is not correct: the attributes are not present if the device is not
capable to wake up the system. They are empty if the device is not enabled
to wake up the system.
