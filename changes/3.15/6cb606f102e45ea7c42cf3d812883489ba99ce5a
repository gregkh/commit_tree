drivers: xen: Include appropriate header file in pcpu.c

Include appropriate header file in xen/pcpu.c because include/xen/acpi.h
contains prototype declaration of functions defined in the file.

This eliminates the following warning in xen/pcpu.c:
drivers/xen/pcpu.c:336:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘xen_pcpu_hotplug_sync’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/xen/pcpu.c:346:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘xen_pcpu_id’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
