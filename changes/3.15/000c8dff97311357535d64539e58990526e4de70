batman-adv: fix neigh reference imbalance

When an interface is removed from batman-adv, the orig_ifinfo of a
orig_node may be removed without releasing the router first.
This will prevent the reference for the neighbor pointed at by the
orig_ifinfo->router to be released, and this leak may result in
reference leaks for the interface used by this neighbor. Fix that.

This is a regression introduced by
