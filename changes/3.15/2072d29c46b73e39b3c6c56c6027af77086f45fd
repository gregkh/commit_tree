arm64: KVM: allows discrimination of AArch32 sysreg access

The current handling of AArch32 trapping is slightly less than
perfect, as it is not possible (from a handler point of view)
to distinguish it from an AArch64 access, nor to tell a 32bit
from a 64bit access either.

Fix this by introducing two additional flags:
- is_aarch32: true if the access was made in AArch32 mode
- is_32bit: true if is_aarch32 == true and a MCR/MRC instruction
  was used to perform the access (as opposed to MCRR/MRRC).

This allows a handler to cover all the possible conditions in which
a system register gets trapped.
