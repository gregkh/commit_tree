xhci: Remove segments from radix tree on failed insert.

If we're expanding a stream ring, we want to make sure we can add those
ring segments to the radix tree that maps segments to ring pointers.
Try the radix tree insert after the new ring segments have been allocated
(the last segment in the new ring chunk will point to the first newly
allocated segment), but before the new ring segments are linked into the
old ring.

If insert fails on any one segment, remove each segment from the radix
tree, deallocate the new segments, and return.  Otherwise, link the new
segments into the tree.

HdG: Add a check to only update stream mappings in xhci_ring_expansion when
the ring is a stream ring.
