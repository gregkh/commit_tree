GFS2: Allocate block for xattr at inode alloc time, if required

This is another step towards improving the allocation of xattr
blocks at inode allocation time. Here we take advantage of
Christoph's recent work on ACLs to allocate a block for the
xattrs early if we know that we will be adding ACLs to the
inode later on. The advantage of that is that it is much
more likely that we'll get a contiguous run of two blocks
where the first is the inode and the second is the xattr block.

We still have to fall back to the original system in case we
don't get the requested two contiguous blocks, or in case the
ACLs are too large to fit into the block.

Future patches will move more of the ACL setting code further
up the gfs2_inode_create() function. Also, I'd like to be
able to do the same thing with the xattrs from LSMs in
due course, too. That way we should be able to slowly reduce
the number of independent transactions, at least in the
most common cases.
