net: ptp: do not reimplement PTP/BPF classifier

There are currently pch_gbe, cpts, and ixp4xx_eth drivers that open-code
and reimplement a BPF classifier for the PTP protocol. Since all of them
effectively do the very same thing and load the very same PTP/BPF filter,
we can just consolidate that code by introducing ptp_classify_raw() in
the time-stamping core framework which can be used in drivers.

As drivers get initialized after bootstrapping the core networking
subsystem, they can make use of ptp_insns wrapped through
ptp_classify_raw(), which allows to simplify and remove PTP classifier
setup code in drivers.

Joint work with Alexei Starovoitov.
