PM / QoS: Add no_constraints_value field to struct pm_qos_constraints

Add a new field, no_constraints_value, to struct pm_qos_constraints
representing a list of PM QoS constraint requests to be returned by
pm_qos_get_value() when that list of requests is empty.

That field will be equal to default_value for all of the existing
global PM QoS classes and for the resume latency device PM QoS type,
but it will be different from default_value for the new latency
tolerance device PM QoS type introduced by the next changeset.
