x86/smpboot: Log error on secondary CPU wakeup failure at ERR level

If system is running without debug level logging,
it will not log error if do_boot_cpu() failed to
wakeup AP. It may lead to silent AP bringup
failures at boot time.
Change message level to KERN_ERR to make error
visible to user as it's done on other architectures.
