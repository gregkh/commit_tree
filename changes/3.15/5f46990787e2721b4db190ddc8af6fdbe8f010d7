cgroup: update the meaning of cftype->max_write_len

cftype->max_write_len is used to extend the maximum size of writes.
It's interpreted in such a way that the actual maximum size is one
less than the specified value.  The default size is defined by
CGROUP_LOCAL_BUFFER_SIZE.  Its interpretation is quite confusing - its
value is decremented by 1 and then compared for equality with max
size, which means that the actual default size is
CGROUP_LOCAL_BUFFER_SIZE - 2, which is 62 chars.

There's no point in having a limit that low.  Update its definition so
that it means the actual string length sans termination and anything
below PAGE_SIZE-1 is treated as PAGE_SIZE-1.

.max_write_len for "release_agent" is updated to PATH_MAX-1 and
cgroup_release_agent_write() is updated so that the redundant strlen()
check is removed and it uses strlcpy() instead of strcpy().
.max_write_len initializations in blk-throttle.c and cfq-iosched.c are
no longer necessary and removed.  The one in cpuset is kept unchanged
as it's an approximated value to begin with.

This will also make transition to kernfs smoother.
