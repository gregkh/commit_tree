KVM: nVMX: Fully emulate preemption timer

We cannot rely on the hardware-provided preemption timer support because
we are holding L2 in HLT outside non-root mode. Furthermore, emulating
the preemption will resolve tick rate errata on older Intel CPUs.

The emulation is based on hrtimer which is started on L2 entry, stopped
on L2 exit and evaluated via the new check_nested_events hook. As we no
longer rely on hardware features, we can enable both the preemption
timer support and value saving unconditionally.
