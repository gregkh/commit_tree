tracing/module: Replace include of tracepoint.h with jump_label.h in module.h

There's nothing in the module.h header that requires tracepoint.h to be
included, and there may be cases that tracepoint.h may need to include
module.h, which will cause recursive header issues.

But module.h requires seeing HAVE_JUMP_LABEL which is set in jump_label.h
which it just coincidentally gets from tracepoint.h.
