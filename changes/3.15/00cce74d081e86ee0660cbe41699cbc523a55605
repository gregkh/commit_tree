spi: qup: Get rid of using struct spi_qup_device

Current code uses struct spi_qup_device to store spi->mode and spi->chip_select
settings. We can get these settings in spi_qup_transfer_one and spi_qup_set_cs
without using struct spi_qup_device. Refactor the code a bit to remove
spi_qup_setup(), spi_qup_cleanup(), and struct spi_qup_device.
