tipc: fix neighbor detection problem after hw address change

If the hardware address of a underlying netdevice is changed, it is
not enough to simply reset the bearer/links over this device. We
also need to reflect this change in the TIPC bearer and node
discovery structures aswell.

This patch adds the necessary reinitialization of the node disovery
mechanism following a hardware address change so that the correct
originating media address is advertised in the discovery messages.
