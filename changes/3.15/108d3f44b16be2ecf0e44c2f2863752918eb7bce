x86/boot: Don't overwrite cr4 when enabling PAE

Some EFI firmware makes use of the FPU during boottime services and
clearing X86_CR4_OSFXSR by overwriting %cr4 causes the firmware to
crash.

Add the PAE bit explicitly instead of trashing the existing contents,
leaving the rest of the bits as the firmware set them.
