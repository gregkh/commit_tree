ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Hotplug notifications from acpi_bus_notify()

Since acpi_bus_notify() is executed on all notifications for all
devices anyway, make it execute acpi_device_hotplug() for all
hotplug events instead of installing notify handlers pointing to
the same function for all hotplug devices.

This change reduces both the size and complexity of ACPI-based device
hotplug code.  Moreover, since acpi_device_hotplug() only does
significant things for devices that have either an ACPI scan handler,
or a hotplug context with .eject() defined, and those devices
had notify handlers pointing to acpi_hotplug_notify_cb() installed
before anyway, this modification shouldn't change functionality.
