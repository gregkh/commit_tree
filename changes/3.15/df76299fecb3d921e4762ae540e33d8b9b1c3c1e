ARM: dove: drop pinctrl PMU reg property

Marvell Dove's pinctrl does require some PMU regs for muxing PMU
functions to MPP pins. Recently, a discussion started about consolidating
Power Management Unit (PMU) into a single DT node. As we don't want
anymore DT ABI in the way, drop the corresponding reg property from
pinctrl node now. The driver will derive the registers from existing
reg properties.
