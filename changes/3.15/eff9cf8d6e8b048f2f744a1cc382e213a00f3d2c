[SCSI] atari_scsi: Fix sleep_on race

sleep_on is known broken and going away. The atari_scsi driver is one of
two remaining users in the falcon_get_lock() function, which is a rather
crazy piece of code. This does not attempt to fix the driver's locking
scheme in general, but at least prevents falcon_get_lock from going to
sleep when no other thread holds the same lock or tries to get it,
and we no longer schedule with irqs disabled.
