ipv4, fib: pass LOOPBACK_IFINDEX instead of 0 to flowi4_iif

As suggested by Julian:

	Simply, flowi4_iif must not contain 0, it does not
	look logical to ignore all ip rules with specified iif.

because in fib_rule_match() we do:

        if (rule->iifindex && (rule->iifindex != fl->flowi_iif))
                goto out;

flowi4_iif should be LOOPBACK_IFINDEX by default.

We need to move LOOPBACK_IFINDEX to include/net/flow.h:

1) It is mostly used by flowi_iif

2) Fix the following compile error if we use it in flow.h
by the patches latter:
