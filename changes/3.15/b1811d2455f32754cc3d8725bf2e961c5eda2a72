PCI: pciehp: Don't disable the link permanently during removal

We need future link up events for hot-add, thus don't disable the link
permanently during device removal. Also, remove the static functions that
are now left unused.

This reverts part of 2debd9289997 ("PCI: pciehp: Disable/enable link during
slot power off/on").  This was discussed at the URL below, where it was
revealed that it was done for a bug in a PCIe repeater chip on that
particular platform.
