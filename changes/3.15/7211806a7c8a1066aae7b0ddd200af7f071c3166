staging: comedi: jr3_pci: introduce boardinfo for the supported boards

Create an enum for the boards supported by this driver and pass that enum in
the pci_driver id_table as the driver_data.

Introduce a boardinfo struct to hold the board specific data for the boards
supported by this driver. Use the boardinfo when attaching to the driver
instead of using the pcidev->device and the switch.

Since the PCI device ids are now only used in the id_table, remove the
defines and open code the device ids.
