ftrace/x86: Have ftrace_write() return -EPERM and clean up callers

Having ftrace_write() return -EPERM on failure, as that's what the callers
return, then we can clean up the code a bit. That is, instead of:

  if (ftrace_write(...))
     return -EPERM;
  return 0;

or

  if (ftrace_write(...)) {
     ret = -EPERM;
     goto_out;
  }

We can instead have:

  return ftrace_write(...);

or

  ret = ftrace_write(...);
  if (ret)
    goto out;
