ACPI / thermal: make acpi_thermal_check asynchronous on resume

On resume we do not need to wait for acpi_thermal_check to finish.
Instead, we can run it asynchronously and not block the whole system
resume. Also, we make sure when we are suspending again, previously
queued work for acpi_thermal_check is done.
