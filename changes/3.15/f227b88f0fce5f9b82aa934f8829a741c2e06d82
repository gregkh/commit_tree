ASoC: core: Add signed register volume control logic

Some codecs use signed volume control representation with non standard
register sizes, e.g. 6 or 7 bit signed integers.

This patch adds generic signed register volume control logic to
soc-core. Instead of a fixed width signed register control, this
implementation uses a 'min' value and the signed bit location to translate
it to an absolute volume. Using the 'sign_bit' we can calculate a
correct mask for the register values and translate it back into signed
integers of standard size.
