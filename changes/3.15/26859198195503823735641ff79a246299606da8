MIPS: Loongson: Rename PRID_IMP_LOONGSON1 and PRID_IMP_LOONGSON2

Loongson-1 is a 32-bit MIPS CPU and Loongson-2/3 are 64-bit MIPS CPUs,
and both Loongson-2/3 has the same PRID IMP filed (0x6300). As a
result, renaming PRID_IMP_LOONGSON1 and PRID_IMP_LOONGSON2 to
PRID_IMP_LOONGSON_32 and PRID_IMP_LOONGSON_64 will make more sense.
