drm/i915: do not setup backlight if not available according to VBT

Some machines use an external EC for controlling the backlight. Info
about this is present in the VBT. Do not setup native backlight control
if no PWM backlight is available or supported according to VBT. The
acpi_backlight interface appears to work for the EC control.

In most cases there has been no harm done, but it looks like there are
machines out there that have both an EC and our PWM line connected to
the same wire. This, obviously, does not end well.

This should fix the regression caused by

    drm/i915: remove QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE

AFAICT the quirk removed by the above commit effectively resulted in
i915 not driving the backlight PWM output, thus not messing things up.

Additionally this should fix the regression caused by

    ACPI / video: Do not register backlight if win8 and native interface exists

which left some machines without a functioning backlight interface.
