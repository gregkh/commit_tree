ASoC: pxa: mioa701_wm9713: Convert to table based DAPM setup

Use table based setup to register the DAPM widgets and routes. This on one hand
makes the code a bit cleaner and on the other hand the board level DAPM elements
get registered in the card's DAPM context rather than in the CODEC's DAPM
context.

Also remove the snd_soc_dapm_enable_pin() calls, since pins are enabled by
default and there are no matching snd_soc_dapm_disable_pin() calls.
