cpufreq: Do not allow ->setpolicy drivers to provide ->target

cpufreq drivers that provide the ->setpolicy() callback are supposed
to have integrated governors, so they don't need to set ->target()
or ->target_index() and may confuse the core if any of these callbacks
is present.

For this reason, add a check preventing ->setpolicy cpufreq drivers
from registering if they have non-NULL ->target or ->target_index.
