ARM: imx: add always-on clock array for i.mx6sl to maintain correct usecount

IPG, ARM and MMDC's clock should be enabled during kernel boot up,
so we need to maintain their usecount, otherwise, they may be
disabled unexpectedly if their children's clock are turned off, and
caused their parent PLLs also get disabled, which is incorrect.
