drm/crtc-helper: skip locking checks in panicking path

Skip locking checks in drm_helper_*_in_use() if they are called in panicking
path. See similar code in drm_warn_on_modeset_not_all_locked().

After panic information has been output, these WARN_ONs go off outputing a lot
of lines and scrolling the panic information out of the screen. Here is a
partial call trace showing how execution reaches them:

? drm_helper_crtc_in_use()
? __drm_helper_disable_unused_functions()
? several *_set_config functions
? drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode()
