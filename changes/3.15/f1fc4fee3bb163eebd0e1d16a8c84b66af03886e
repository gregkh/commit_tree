ceph: fscache: Wait for completion of object initialization

The object store limit needs to be updated after writing,
and this can be done provided the corresponding object has already
been initialized. Current object initialization is done asynchrously,
which introduce a race if a file is opened, then immediately followed
by a writing, the initialization may have not completed, the code will
reach the ASSERT in fscache_submit_exclusive_op() to cause kernel
bug.
