PM / hibernate: use name_to_dev_t to parse resume

Use the name_to_dev_t call to parse the device name echo'd to
to /sys/power/resume.  This imitates the method used in hibernate.c
in software_resume, and allows the resume partition to be specified
using other equivalent device formats as well.  By allowing
/sys/debug/resume to accept the same syntax as the resume=device
parameter, we can parse the resume=device in the init script and
use the resume device directly from the kernel command line.
