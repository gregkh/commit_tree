usb: wusbcore: fix potential double list_del on urb dequeue

This patch locks rpipe->seg_lock around the entire transfer segment
cleanup loop in wa_urb_dequeue instead of just one case of the switch
statement.  This fixes a race between __wa_xfer_delayed_run and
wa_urb_dequeue where a transfer segment in the WA_SEG_DELAYED state
could be removed from the rpipe seg_list twice leading to memory
corruption.  It also switches the spin_lock call to use the non-irqsave
version since the xfer->lock is already held and irqs already disabled.
