net_sched: htb: do not acquire qdisc lock in dump operations

htb_dump() and htb_dump_class() do not strictly need to acquire
qdisc lock to fetch qdisc and/or class parameters.

We hold RTNL and no changes can occur.

This reduces by 50% qdisc lock pressure while doing tc qdisc|class dump
operations.
