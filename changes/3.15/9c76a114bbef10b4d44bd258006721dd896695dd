ipv6: tcp_ipv6 policy route issue

The issue raises when adding policy route, specify a particular
NIC as oif, the policy route did not take effect. The reason is
that fl6.oif is not set and route map failed. From the
tcp_v6_send_response function, if the binding address is linklocal,
fl6.oif is set, but not for global address.
