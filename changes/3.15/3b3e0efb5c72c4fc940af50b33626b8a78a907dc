ath9k: fix ready time of the multicast buffer queue

qi->tqi_readyTime is written directly to registers that expect
microseconds as unit instead of TU.
When setting the CABQ ready time, cur_conf->beacon_interval is in TU, so
convert it to microseconds before passing it to ath9k_hw.

This should hopefully fix some Tx DMA issues with buffered multicast
frames in AP mode.
