memcg, slab: cleanup memcg cache creation

This patch cleans up the memcg cache creation path as follows:

- Move memcg cache name creation to a separate function to be called
  from kmem_cache_create_memcg().  This allows us to get rid of the mutex
  protecting the temporary buffer used for the name formatting, because
  the whole cache creation path is protected by the slab_mutex.

- Get rid of memcg_create_kmem_cache().  This function serves as a proxy
  to kmem_cache_create_memcg().  After separating the cache name creation
  path, it would be reduced to a function call, so let's inline it.
