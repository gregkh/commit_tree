of: Increase MAX_PHANDLE_ARGS

arm-smmu driver uses of_parse_phandle_with_args when parsing DT
information to determine stream IDs for a master device.
Thus the number of stream IDs per master device is bound by
MAX_PHANDLE_ARGS.

To support Calxeda ECX-2000 hardware arm-smmu driver requires a
slightly higher value for MAX_PHANDLE_ARGS as this hardware has 10
stream IDs for one master device.

Increasing it to 16 seems a reasonable choice.
