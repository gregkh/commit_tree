[media] drx-j: properly handle bit counts on stats

Instead of just assuming that the min resolution is 1E-6,
pass both bit error and bit counts for userspace to calculate
BER. The same applies for PER, for 8VSB. It is not clear how
to get the packet count for QAM. So, for now, don't expose PER
for QAM.
