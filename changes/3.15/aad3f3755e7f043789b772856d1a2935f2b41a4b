xfs: xfs_vm_write_end truncates too much on failure

Similar to the write_begin problem, xfs-vm_write_end will truncate
back to the old EOF, potentially removing page cache from over the
top of delalloc blocks with valid data in them. Fix this by
truncating back to just the start of the failed write.
