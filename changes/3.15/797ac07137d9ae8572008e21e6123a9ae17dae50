net: phy: move PHY software reset to genphy_soft_reset

As pointed out by Shaohui, this function is generic for 10/100/1000
PHYs, but 10G PHYs might have a slightly different reset sequence which
prevents most of them from using this function.

Move the BMCR_RESET based software resent sequence to
genphy_soft_reset() in preparation for allowing PHY drivers to implement
a soft_reset() callback.
