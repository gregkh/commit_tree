xen-netback: Remove old TX grant copy definitons and fix indentations

These became obsolete with grant mapping. I've left intentionally the
indentations in this way, to improve readability of previous patches.

NOTE: if bisect brought you here, you should apply the series up until
"xen-netback: Timeout packets in RX path", otherwise Windows guests can't work
properly and malicious guests can block other guests by not releasing their sent
packets.
