scripts: objdiff: detect object code changes between two commits

objdiff is useful when doing large code cleanups.  For example, when
removing checkpatch warnings and errors from new drivers in the staging
tree.

objdiff can be used in conjunction with a git rebase to confirm that
each commit made no changes to the resulting object code.  It has the
same return values as diff(1).

This was written specifically to support adding the skein and threefish
cryto drivers to the staging tree.  I needed a programmatic way to
confirm that commits changing >90% of the lines didn't inadvertently
change the code.

Temporary files (objdump output) are stored in

  /path/to/linux/.tmp_objdiff

'make mrproper' will remove this directory.
