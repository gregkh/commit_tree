dm thin: irqsave must always be used with the pool->lock spinlock

Commit c140e1c4e23 ("dm thin: use per thin device deferred bio lists")
incorrectly stopped disabling irqs when taking the pool's spinlock.

Irqs must be disabled when taking the pool's spinlock otherwise a thread
could spin_lock(), then get interrupted to service thin_endio() in
interrupt context, which would then deadlock in spin_lock_irqsave().
