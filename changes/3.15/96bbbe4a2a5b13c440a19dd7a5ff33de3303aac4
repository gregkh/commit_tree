cpufreq: Remove unnecessary variable/parameter 'frozen'

We have used 'frozen' variable/function parameter at many places to
distinguish between CPU offline/online on suspend/resume vs sysfs
removals. We now have another variable cpufreq_suspended which can
be used in these cases, so we can get rid of all those variables or
function parameters.
