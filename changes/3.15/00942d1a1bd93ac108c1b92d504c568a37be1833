[media] media: rc: add sysfs scancode filtering interface

Add and document a generic sysfs based scancode filtering interface for
making use of IR data matching hardware to filter out uninteresting
scancodes. Two filters exist, one for normal operation and one for
filtering scancodes which are permitted to wake the system from suspend.

The following files are added to /sys/class/rc/rc?/:
 - filter: normal scancode filter value
 - filter_mask: normal scancode filter mask
 - wakeup_filter: wakeup scancode filter value
 - wakeup_filter_mask: wakeup scancode filter mask

A new s_filter() driver callback is added which must arrange for the
specified filter to be applied at the right time. Drivers can convert
the scancode filter into a raw IR data filter, which can be applied
immediately or later (for wake up filters).
