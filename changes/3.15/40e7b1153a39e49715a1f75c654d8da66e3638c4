i2c: gpio: OF gpio code does not handle defered probe case

When using device-tree and the i2c-gpio driver is called before the
GPIO node has been probed then it needs to correctly defer the probe
instead of returning a permanent error that the gpio numbers are not
valid.

This fixes the following error:
	/i2c@2: invalid GPIO pins, sda=-517/scl=-517
