Btrfs: fix wrong lock range and write size in check_can_nocow()

The write range may not be sector-aligned, for example:

       |--------|--------|	<- write range, sector-unaligned, size: 2blocks
  |--------|--------|--------|  <- correct lock range, size: 3blocks

But according to the old code, we used the size of write range to calculate
the lock range directly, not considered the offset, we would get a wrong lock
range:

       |--------|--------|	<- write range, sector-unaligned, size: 2blocks
  |--------|--------|		<- wrong lock range, size: 2blocks

And besides that, the old code also had the same problem when calculating
the real write size. Correct them.
