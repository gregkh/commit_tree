powerpc/perf: Add hv_gpci interface header

"H_GetPerformanceCounterInfo" (refered to as hv_gpci or just gpci from
here on) is an interface to retrieve specific performance counters and
other data from the hypervisor. All outputs have a fixed format. This
header only describes the portions of the interface that we plan on
using in linux at this time.
