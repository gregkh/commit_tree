wait: swap EXIT_ZOMBIE and EXIT_DEAD to hide EXIT_TRACE from user-space

get_task_state() uses the most significant bit to report the state to
user-space, this means that EXIT_ZOMBIE->EXIT_TRACE->EXIT_DEAD transition
can be noticed via /proc as Z -> X -> Z change.  Note that this was
possible even before EXIT_TRACE was introduced.

This is not really bad but imho it make sense to hide EXIT_TRACE from
user-space completely.  So the patch simply swaps EXIT_ZOMBIE and
EXIT_DEAD, this way EXIT_TRACE will be seen as EXIT_ZOMBIE by user-space.
