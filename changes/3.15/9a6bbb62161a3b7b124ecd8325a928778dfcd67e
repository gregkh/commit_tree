drm/i915: Don't pin the status page as mappable

We access it through the cpu window. No functional difference expected
atm since we default to a bottom-up allocation scheme. But that might
eventually change so that we prefer the unmappable range for buffers
that don't need cpu gtt access.

Split out from Chris vma-bind rework.

Note that this is only possible due to the split-up of the mappable
pin flag into PIN_GLOBAL and PIN_MAPPABLE.
