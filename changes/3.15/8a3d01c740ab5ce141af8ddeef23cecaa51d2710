x86/PCI: Use NUMA_NO_NODE, not -1, for unknown node

NUMA_NO_NODE is the usual value for "we don't know what node this is on,"
e.g., it is the error return from acpi_get_node().  This changes uses of -1
to NUMA_NO_NODE.  NUMA_NO_NODE is #defined to be -1 already, so this is not
a functional change.
