drm/omap: protect omap_crtc's event with event_lock spinlock

The vblank_cb callback and the page_flip ioctl can occur together in different
CPU contexts. vblank_cb uses takes tje drm device's event_lock spinlock when
sending the vblank event and updating omap_crtc->event and omap_crtc->od_fb.

Use the same spinlock in page_flip, to make sure the above omap_crtc parameters
are configured sequentially.
