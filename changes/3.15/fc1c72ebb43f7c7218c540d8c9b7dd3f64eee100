ARM: dts: keystone: add support for K2 Lamarr SoC and EVM

Keystone2 Lamarr (K2L) is a dual Cortex A15 core based SoC with
4 DSPs. It has standard peripherals such as i2c, spi, uart, timer,
pcie etc., similar to k2hk, but different set of wireless hardware.
This patch add support for k2 Lamarr SoC and EVM. This re-uses the
common keystone.dtsi to include common bindings across the various
k2 devices.
