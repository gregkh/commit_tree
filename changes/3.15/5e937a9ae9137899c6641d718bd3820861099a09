syscall_get_arch: remove useless function arguments

Every caller of syscall_get_arch() uses current for the task and no
implementors of the function need args.  So just get rid of both of
those things.  Admittedly, since these are inline functions we aren't
wasting stack space, but it just makes the prototypes better.
