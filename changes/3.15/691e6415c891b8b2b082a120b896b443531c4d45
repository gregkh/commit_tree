drm/i915: Always use kref tracking for all contexts.

If we always initialize kref for the context, even if we are using fake
contexts for hangstats when there is no hw support, we can forgo the
dance to dereference the ctx->obj and inspect whether we are permitted
to use kref inside i915_gem_context_reference() and _unreference().

My ulterior motive here is to improve the debugging of a use-after-free
of ctx->obj. This patch avoids the dereference here and instead forces
the assertion checks associated with kref.

v2: Refactor the fake contexts to being even more like the real
contexts, so that there is much less duplicated and special case code.

v3: Tweaks.
v4: Tweaks, minor.
