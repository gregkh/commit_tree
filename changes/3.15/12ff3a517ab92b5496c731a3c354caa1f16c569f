random: simplify loop in random_read

The loop condition never changes until just before a break, so we
might as well write it as a constant.  Also since a996996dd75a
("random: drop weird m_time/a_time manipulation") we don't do anything
after the loop finishes, so the 'break's might as well return
directly.  Some other simplifications.

There should be no change in behavior introduced by this commit.
