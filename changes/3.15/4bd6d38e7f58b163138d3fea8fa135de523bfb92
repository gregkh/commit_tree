Bluetooth: Remove unneeded "force" parameter from smp_distribute_keys()

Now that to-be-received keys are properly tracked we no-longer need the
"force" parameter to smp_distribute_keys(). It was essentially acting as
an indicator whether all keys have been received, but now it's just
redundant together with smp->remote_key_dist.
