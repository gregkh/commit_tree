drivers: reset: Reset controller driver for STiH416

This patch adds a reset controller platform driver for the STiH416
SoC. This initial version provides a compatible driver for the
"st,stih416-powerdown" device, which registers a system configuration
register based reset controller that controls the powerdown state of
hardware such as the on-chip USB host controllers.
