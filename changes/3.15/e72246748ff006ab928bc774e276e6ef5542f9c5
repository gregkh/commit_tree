locking/mutexes/mcs: Restructure the MCS lock defines and locking code into its own file

We will need the MCS lock code for doing optimistic spinning for rwsem
and queued rwlock.  Extracting the MCS code from mutex.c and put into
its own file allow us to reuse this code easily.

We also inline mcs_spin_lock and mcs_spin_unlock functions
for better efficiency.

Note that using the smp_load_acquire/smp_store_release pair used in
mcs_lock and mcs_unlock is not sufficient to form a full memory barrier
across cpus for many architectures (except x86).  For applications that
absolutely need a full barrier across multiple cpus with mcs_unlock and
mcs_lock pair, smp_mb__after_unlock_lock() should be used after mcs_lock.
