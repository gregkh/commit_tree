reiserfs: fix race in readdir

jdm-20004 reiserfs_delete_xattrs: Couldn't delete all xattrs (-2)

The -ENOENT is due to readdir calling dir_emit on the same entry twice.

If the dir_emit callback sleeps and the tree is changed underneath us,
we won't be able to trust deh_offset(deh) anymore. We need to save
next_pos before we might sleep so we can find the next entry.
