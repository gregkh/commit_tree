perf symbols: Record the reason for filtering an address_location

By turning the addr_location->filtered member from a boolean to a u8
bitmap, reusing (and extending) the hist_filter enum for that.

This patch doesn't change the logic at all, as it keeps the meaning of
al->filtered !0 to mean that the entry _was_ filtered, so no change in
how this value is interpreted needs to be done at this point.

This will be soon used in upcoming patches.
