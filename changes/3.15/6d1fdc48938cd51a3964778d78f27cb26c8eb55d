memcg: sanitize __mem_cgroup_try_charge() call protocol

Some callsites pass a memcg directly, some callsites pass an mm that
then has to be translated to a memcg.  This makes for a terrible
function interface.

Just push the mm-to-memcg translation into the respective callsites and
always pass a memcg to mem_cgroup_try_charge().
