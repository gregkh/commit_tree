drm/i915: Refactor gen6_set_rps

What used to be a short-circuit now needs to adjust interrupt masking in
response to user requests for changing the min/max allowed frequencies.
This is currently done by a special case and early return, but the next
patch adds another common action to take, so refactor the code to reduce
duplication.
