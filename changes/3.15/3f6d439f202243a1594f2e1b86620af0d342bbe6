clk: reverse default clk provider initialization order in of_clk_init()

This restores the default clocks registration order as parsed from
devicetree, i.e. as before commit 1771b10d605d26ccee771a7fb4b08718
"clk: respect the clock dependencies in of_clk_init", for when there
is no explicit parent clock dependencies between clock providers
specified in the device tree.

It prevents regressions (boot failure, division by 0 errors) on
imx and exynos platforms.
