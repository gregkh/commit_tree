ARM: 7962/2: Make all mcpm functions notrace

The functions in mcpm_entry.c are mostly intended for use during
scary cache and coherency disabling sequences, or do other things
which confuse trace ... like powering a CPU down and not
returning. Similarly for the backend code.

For simplicity, this patch just makes whole files notrace.
There should be more than enough traceable points on the paths to
these functions, but we can be more fine-grained later if there is
a need for it.

Jon Medhurst:
Also added spc.o to the list of files as it contains functions used by
MCPM code which have comments comments like: "might be used in code
paths where normal cacheable locks are not working"
