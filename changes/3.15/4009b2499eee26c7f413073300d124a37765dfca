KVM: ioapic: try to recover if pending_eoi goes out of range

The RTC tracking code tracks the cardinality of rtc_status.dest_map
into rtc_status.pending_eoi.  It has some WARN_ONs that trigger if
pending_eoi ever becomes negative; however, these do not do anything
to recover, and it bad things will happen soon after they trigger.

When the next RTC interrupt is triggered, rtc_check_coalesced() will
return false, but ioapic_service will find pending_eoi != 0 and
do a BUG_ON.  To avoid this, should pending_eoi ever be nonzero,
call kvm_rtc_eoi_tracking_restore_all to recompute a correct
dest_map and pending_eoi.
