staging: comedi: dmm32at: use comedi_timeout()

Use comedi_timeout() to wait for the analog input settle and end-of-
conversion. These tests use different registers but the same bit so
the register is passed as the 'context'. The same test is used in
dmm32at_ai_cmd() but the 'insn' is not available. This is ok since
the test function, and comedi_timeout() don't use it.

Use comedi_timout() to wait for the analog output end-of-conversion.
