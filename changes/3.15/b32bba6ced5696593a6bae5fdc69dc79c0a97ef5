Bluetooth: Replace own_address_type with force_static_address debugfs

The own_address_type debugfs option does not providing enough
flexibity for interacting with the upcoming LE privacy support.

What really is needed is an option to force using the static address
compared to the public address. The new force_static_address debugfs
option does exactly that. In addition it is also only available when
the controller does actually have a public address. For single mode
LE only controllers this option will not be available.
