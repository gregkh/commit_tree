s390/compat: automatic zero, sign and pointer conversion of syscalls

Instead of explicitly changing compat system call parameters from e.g.
unsigned long to compat_ulong_t let the COMPAT_SYSCALL_WRAP macros
automatically detect (unsigned) long parameters and zero and sign
extend them automatically.
The resulting binary is completely identical.

In addition add a sys_[system call name] prototype for each system call
wrapper. This will cause compile errors if the prototype does not match
the prototype in include/linux/syscall.h.
Therefore we should now always get the correct zero and sign extension
of system call parameters. Pointers are handled like before.
