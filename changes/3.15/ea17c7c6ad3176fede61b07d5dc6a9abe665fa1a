USB: ELAN: Remove useless "default M" lines

The Kconfig entries for USB_U132_HCD and USB_FTDI_ELAN default to
(uppercase) "M". But in Kconfig (lowercase) "m" is a magic symbol. "M"
is an ordinary symbol. As "M" is never set these Kconfig symbols will
also not be set by default.

Since I'm not aware of a reason why these driver should be set by
default, let's just drop these lines (that basically do nothing).
