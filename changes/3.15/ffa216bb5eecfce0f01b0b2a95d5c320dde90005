brcmfmac: Fix brcmf_chip_ai_coredisable not applying reset bits to BCMA_IOCTL

brcmfmac has been broken on my cubietruck with a BCM43362:

brcmfmac: brcmf_chip_recognition: found AXI chip: BCM43362, rev=1
brcmfmac: brcmf_c_preinit_dcmds: Firmware version = wl0:
        Apr 22 2013 14:50:00 version 5.90.195.89.6 FWID 01-b30a427d

since commit 53036261033: "brcmfmac: update core reset and disable routines".

The problem is that since this commit brcmf_chip_ai_resetcore no longer sets
BCMA_IOCTL itself before bringing the core out of reset, instead relying on
brcmf_chip_ai_coredisable to do so. But brcmf_chip_ai_coredisable is a nop
of the chip is already in reset. This patch modifies brcmf_chip_ai_coredisable
to always set BCMA_IOCTL even if the core is already in reset.

This fixes brcmfmac hanging in firmware loading on my board.
