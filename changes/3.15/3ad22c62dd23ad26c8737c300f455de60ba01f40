fuse: clear FUSE_I_CTIME_DIRTY flag on setattr

The patch addresses two use-cases when the flag may be safely cleared:

1. fuse_do_setattr() is called with ATTR_CTIME flag set in attr->ia_valid.
In this case attr->ia_ctime bears actual value. In-kernel fuse must send it
to the userspace server and then assign the value to inode->i_ctime.

2. fuse_do_setattr() is called with ATTR_SIZE flag set in attr->ia_valid,
whereas ATTR_CTIME is not set (truncate(2)).
In this case in-kernel fuse must sent "now" to the userspace server and then
assign the value to inode->i_ctime.

In both cases we could clear I_DIRTY_SYNC, but that needs more thought.
