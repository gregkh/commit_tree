dm: add era target

dm-era is a target that behaves similar to the linear target.  In
addition it keeps track of which blocks were written within a user
defined period of time called an 'era'.  Each era target instance
maintains the current era as a monotonically increasing 32-bit
counter.

Use cases include tracking changed blocks for backup software, and
partially invalidating the contents of a cache to restore cache
coherency after rolling back a vendor snapshot.

dm-era is primarily expected to be paired with the dm-cache target.
