ALSA: pcm_dmaengine: Add check during device suspend

Currently snd_dmaengine_pcm_trigger() calls dmaengine_pause()
unconditinally during device suspend. In case where DMA controller
doesn't support PAUSE/RESUME functionality, this call is not able
to stop the DMA controller. In this scenario, audio playback doesn't
resume after device resume.

Calling dmaengine_pause/dmaengine_terminate_all conditionally fixes
the issue.

It has been tested with audio playback on Samsung platform having
PL330 DMA controller which doesn't support PAUSE/RESUME.
