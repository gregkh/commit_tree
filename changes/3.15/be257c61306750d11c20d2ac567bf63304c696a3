zram: do not pass rw argument to __zram_make_request()

Do not pass rw argument down the __zram_make_request() -> zram_bvec_rw()
chain, decode it in zram_bvec_rw() instead.  Besides, this is the place
where we distinguish READ and WRITE bio data directions, so account zram
RW stats here, instead of __zram_make_request().  This also allows to
account a real number of zram READ/WRITE operations, not just requests
(single RW request may cause a number of zram RW ops with separate
locking, compression/decompression, etc).
