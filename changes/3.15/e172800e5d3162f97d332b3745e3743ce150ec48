asm-generic: rwsem: de-PPCify rwsem.h

asm-generic/rwsem.h used to live under arch/powerpc. During its
liberation to common code, a few references to its former home where
preserved, in particular the definition of RWSEM_ACTIVE_MASK is
predicated on CONFIG_PPC64.

This patch updates the ifdefs and comments to architecturally neutral
versions.
