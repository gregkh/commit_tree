iscsi-target: Change BUG_ON to REJECT in iscsit_process_nop_out

This patch changes an incorrect use of BUG_ON to instead generate a
REJECT + PROTOCOL_ERROR in iscsit_process_nop_out() code.  This case
can occur with traditional TCP where a flood of zeros in the data
stream can reach this block for what is presumed to be a NOP-OUT with
a solicited reply, but without a valid iscsi_cmd pointer.

This incorrect BUG_ON was introduced during the v3.11-rc timeframe
with the following commit:
