i40evf: correctly program RSS HLUT table

The HLUT programming loop in in i40evf_configure_rss was a) overly-
complicated, and b) just plain broken. Most of the entries ended up being
not written at all, so most of the flows ended up at queue zero.

Refactor the HLUT programming loop to simply walk through the registers
and write four values to each one, incrementing through the number of
available queues.
