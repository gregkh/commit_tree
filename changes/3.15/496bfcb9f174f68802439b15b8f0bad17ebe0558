drm/i915: Don't use gtt mapping for !gtt error objects

The existing check was insufficient to determine whether we can use the
GTT mapping to read out the object during error capture.

The previous condition was, if the object has a GGTT mapping, and the
reloc is in the GTT range... the can happen with opjects mapped into
multiple vms (one of which being the GTT).

There are two solutions to this problem:
1. This patch, which avoid reading the io mapping
2. Use the GGTT offset with the io mapping.

Since error capture is about recording the most accurate possible error
state, and the error was caused by the object not in the GGTT - I opted
for the former.
