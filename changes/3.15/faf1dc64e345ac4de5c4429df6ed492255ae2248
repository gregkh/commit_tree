ath9k_htc: Stop ANI before doing hw_reset

During remain on channel request, ANI worker thread is not stopped
before doing hw reset. This is causing kernel crash in
hw_per_calibration. This change ensures that ANI is stopped before
doing chip reset and it will be rescheduled later when the chip is
configured back to home channel and having valid bss.
