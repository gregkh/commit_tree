drm/i915: remove the vblank_wait hack from HSW+

When I forked haswell_crtc_enable I copied all the code from
ironlake_crtc_enable. The last piece of the function contains a big
comment with a call to intel_wait_for_vblank. After this fork, we
rearranged the Haswell code so that it enables the planes as the very
last step of the modeset sequence, so we're sure that we call
intel_enable_primary_plane after the pipe is really running, so the
vblank waiting functions work as expected. I really believe this is
what fixes the problem described by the big comment, so let's give it
a try and get rid of that intel_wait_for_vblank, saving around 16ms
per modeset (and init/resume). We can always revert if needed :)
