9P: Add memory barriers to protect request fields over cb/rpc threads handoff

We need barriers to guarantee this pattern works as intended:
[w] req->rc, 1		[r] req->status, 1
wmb			rmb
[w] req->status, 1	[r] req->rc

Where the wmb ensures that rc gets written before status,
and the rmb ensures that if you observe status == 1, rc is the new value.
