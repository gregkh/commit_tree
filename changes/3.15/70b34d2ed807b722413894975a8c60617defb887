w1: new netlink commands, add/remove/list slaves

Introduce new commands to add, remove, and list slave devices through
the netlink interface.  This can be useful to skip the search on a
static network.  They could previously only be added or removed
through automatic search or sysfs, and this allows a program to only
use netlink.

Only allocate memory when needed, so move kzalloc into w1_get_slaves
where it was used.
