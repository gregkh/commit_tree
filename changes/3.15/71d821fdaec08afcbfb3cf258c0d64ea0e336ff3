PM / QoS: Add type to dev_pm_qos_add_ancestor_request() arguments

Rework dev_pm_qos_add_ancestor_request() so that device PM QoS type
is passed to it as the third argument and make it support the
DEV_PM_QOS_LATENCY_TOLERANCE device PM QoS type (in addition to
DEV_PM_QOS_RESUME_LATENCY).

That will allow the drivers of devices without latency tolerance
hardware support to use their ancestors having it as proxies for
their latency tolerance requirements.
