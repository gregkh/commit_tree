[SCSI] hpsa: bring format-in-progress drives online when ready

Do not expose drives that are undergoing a format immediately
to the OS, instead wait until they are ready before bringing
them online.  This is so that logical drives created with
"rapid parity initialization" do not get immediately kicked
off the system for being unresponsive.
