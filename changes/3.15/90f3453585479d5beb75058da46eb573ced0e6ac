Drivers: hv: vmbus: Extract the mmio information from DSDT

On Gen2 firmware, Hyper-V does not emulate the PCI bus. However, the MMIO
information is packaged up in DSDT. Extract this information and export it
for use by the synthetic framebuffer driver. This is the only driver that
needs this currently.

In this version of the patch mmio, I have updated the hyperv header file
(linux/hyperv.h) with mmio definitions.
