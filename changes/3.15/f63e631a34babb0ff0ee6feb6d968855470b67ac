drivers: block: Mark functions as static in drbd_receiver.c

Mark functions conn_wait_active_ee_empty() and
drbd_crypto_alloc_digest_safe() as static in drbd/drbd_receiver.c
because they are not used outside this file.

This eliminates the following warning in drbd/drbd_receiver.c:
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_receiver.c:1401:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘conn_wait_active_ee_empty’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_receiver.c:3259:21: warning: no previous prototype for ‘drbd_crypto_alloc_digest_safe’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
