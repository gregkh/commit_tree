locking/mcs: Allow architectures to hook in to contended paths

When contended, architectures may be able to reduce the polling overhead
in ways which aren't expressible using a simple relax() primitive.

This patch allows architectures to hook into the mcs_{lock,unlock}
functions for the contended cases only.
