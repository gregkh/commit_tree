ARM: dts: Fix bad OTG muxing for cm-t boards

Looks like the OTG pins are off by 2 and we get this:

pinctrl-single 48002030.pinmux: pin 480021a0.0 already requested by 49020000.serial; cannot claim for 480ab000.usb_otg_hs
pinctrl-single 48002030.pinmux: pin-184 (480ab000.usb_otg_hs) status -22
pinctrl-single 48002030.pinmux: could not request pin 184 (480021a0.0) from group pinmux_hsusb0_pins  on device pinctrl-single
musb-omap2430 480ab000.usb_otg_hs: Error applying setting, reverse things back

That's probably because the TRM lists the values as
32-bit registers so every second needs 2 added to the
address. The OTG pin start range must start from
0x21a2, not 0x21a0.
