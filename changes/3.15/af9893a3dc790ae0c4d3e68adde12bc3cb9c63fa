Drivers: net: hyperv: Address UDP checksum issues

ws2008r2 does not support UDP checksum offload. Thus, we cannnot turn on
UDP offload in the host. Also, on ws2012 and ws2012 r2, there appear to be
an issue with UDP checksum offload.
Fix this issue by computing the UDP checksum in the Hyper-V driver.

Based on Dave Miller's comments, in this version, I have COWed the skb
before modifying the UDP header (the checksum field).
