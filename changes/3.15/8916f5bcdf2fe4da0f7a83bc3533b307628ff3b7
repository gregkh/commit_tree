staging: comedi: pcl818: tidy up the analog input (*insn_read)

For aesthetics, move this function out of the async command support
code.

For safety, the INT request (end-of-conversion flag) should be cleared
before doing each conversion and after the final data sample is read.
This driver already clears the flag before starting a conversion but it
does not clear the flag after the final sample.

Refactor the function a bit so that the flag is cleared for a conversion
timeout and after the last sample.

Do a bit of other tidying up during the move.
