MIPS/loongson2_cpufreq: Fix CPU clock rate setting

Loongson2 has been using (incorrectly) kHz for cpu_clk rate. This has
been unnoticed, as loongson2_cpufreq was the only place where the rate
was set/get. After commit 652ed95d5fa6074b3c4ea245deb0691f1acb6656
(cpufreq: introduce cpufreq_generic_get() routine) things however broke,
and now loops_per_jiffy adjustments are incorrect (1000 times too long).
The patch fixes this by changing cpu_clk rate to Hz.
