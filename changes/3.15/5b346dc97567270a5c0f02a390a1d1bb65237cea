ixgbevf: Protect ixgbevf_down with __IXGBEVF_DOWN bit

The ixgbevf_down function can now prevent multiple executions by
doing test_and_set_bit on __IXGBEVF_DOWN. This did not work before
introduction of the __IXGBEVF_REMOVING bit, because of overloading
of __IXGBEVF_DOWN. Also add smp_mb__before_clear_bit call before
clearing the __IXGBEVF_DOWN bit.
