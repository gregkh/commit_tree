fuse: fuse: add time_gran to INIT_OUT

Allow userspace fs to specify time granularity.

This is needed because with writeback_cache mode the kernel is responsible
for generating mtime and ctime, but if the underlying filesystem doesn't
support nanosecond granularity then the cache will contain a different
value from the one stored on the filesystem resulting in a change of times
after a cache flush.

Make the default granularity 1s.
