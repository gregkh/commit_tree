i40evf: refactor reset handling

Respond better to a VF reset event. When a reset is signaled by the
PF, or detected by the watchdog task, prevent the watchdog from
processing admin queue requests, and schedule the reset task.

In the reset task, wait first for the reset to start, then for it to
complete, then reinit the driver.

If the reset never appears to complete after a long, long time (>10
seconds is possible depending on what's going on with the PF driver),
then set a flag to indicate that PF communications have failed.

If this flag is set, check for the reset to complete in the watchdog,
and  attempt to do a full reinitialization of the driver from scratch.

With these changes the VF driver correctly handles a PF reset event
while running on bare metal, or in a VM.

Also update copyrights.
