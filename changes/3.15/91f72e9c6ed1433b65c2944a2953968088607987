checkpatch: don't warn on some function pointer return styles

Checks for some function pointer return styles are too strict.  Fix
them.

Multiple spaces after function pointer return types are allowed.
	int  (*foo)(int bar)

Spaces after function pointer returns of pointer types are not required.
	int *(*foo)(int bar)
