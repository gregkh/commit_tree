pkt_sched: do not use rcu in tc_dump_qdisc()

Like all rtnetlink dump operations, we hold RTNL in tc_dump_qdisc(),
so we do not need to use rcu protection to protect list of netdevices.

This will allow preemption to occur, thus reducing latencies.
Following patch adds explicit cond_resched() calls.
