Btrfs: skip submitting barrier for missing device

I got an error on v3.13:
 BTRFS error (device sdf1) in write_all_supers:3378: errno=-5 IO failure (errors while submitting device barriers.)

how to reproduce:
  > mkfs.btrfs -f -d raid1 /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdf2
  > wipefs -a /dev/sdf2
  > mount -o degraded /dev/sdf1 /mnt
  > btrfs balance start -f -sconvert=single -mconvert=single -dconvert=single /mnt

The reason of the error is that barrier_all_devices() failed to submit
barrier to the missing device.  However it is clear that we cannot do
anything on missing device, and also it is not necessary to care chunks
on the missing device.

This patch stops sending/waiting barrier if device is missing.
