MIPS: csum_partial.S CPU_DADDI_WORKAROUNDS bug fix

This change reverts most of commit
60724ca59eda766a30be57aec6b49bc3e2bead91 [MIPS: IP checksums: Remove
unncessary .set pseudos] that introduced warnings with the
CPU_DADDI_WORKAROUNDS option set:

[and so on, and so on...]

The warnings are benign and good code is produced regardless because no
macros that'd use the assembler's temporary register are involved, however
the `.set noat' directives removed by the commit referred are crucial to
guarantee this is still going to be the case after any changes in the
future.  Therefore they need to be brought back to place which this
change does.
