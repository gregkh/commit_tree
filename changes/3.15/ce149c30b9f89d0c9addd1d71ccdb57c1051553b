ohci-platform: Change compatible string from usb-ohci to generic-ohci

The initial versions of the devicetree enablement patches for ohci-platform
used "ohci-platform" as compatible string. However this was disliked by various
reviewers because the platform bus is a Linux invention and devicetree is
supposed to be OS agnostic. After much discussion I gave up and went with
the generic usb-ohci as requested.

In retro-spect I should have chosen something different, the dts files for many
existing boards already claim to be compatible with "usb-ohci", ie they have:

	compatible = "ti,ohci-omap3", "usb-ohci";

In theory this should not be a problem since the "ti,ohci-omap3" entry takes
presedence, but in practice using a conflicting compatible string is an issue,
because it makes which driver gets used depend on driver registration order.

This patch changes the compatible string claimed by ohci-platform to
"generic-ohci", avoiding the driver registration / module loading ordering
problems.
