mm: madvise: fix MADV_WILLNEED on shmem swapouts

MADV_WILLNEED currently does not read swapped out shmem pages back in.

Commit 0cd6144aadd2 ("mm + fs: prepare for non-page entries in page
cache radix trees") made find_get_page() filter exceptional radix tree
entries but failed to convert all find_get_page() callers that WANT
exceptional entries over to find_get_entry().  One of them is shmem swap
readahead in madvise, which now skips over any swap-out records.

Convert it to find_get_entry().
