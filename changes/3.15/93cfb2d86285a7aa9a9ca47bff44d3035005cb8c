pinctrl: tegra: consistency cleanup

Fix Tegra30/114/124 pinmux drivers consistency issues.
* Sort all lists of the same object type (e.g. #defines for pins, and
  the array that defines their names) in the same order.
* Whitespace fixes.
* Consistency in layout between the 3 drivers.

These driver files were also auto-generated, which should allow us to
make e.g. the U-Boot drivers completely consistent with the kernel in
the future:-)
