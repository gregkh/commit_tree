Revert "nfsd4: fix nfs4err_resource in 4.1 case"

Since we're still limiting attributes to a page, the result here is that
a large getattr result will return NFS4ERR_REP_TOO_BIG/TOO_BIG_TO_CACHE
instead of NFS4ERR_RESOURCE.

Both error returns are wrong, and the real bug here is the arbitrary
limit on getattr results, fixed by as-yet out-of-tree patches.  But at a
minimum we can make life easier for clients by sticking to one broken
behavior in released kernels instead of two....

Trond says:

	one immediate consequence of this patch will be that NFSv4.1
	clients will now report EIO instead of EREMOTEIO if they hit the
	problem. That may make debugging a little less obvious.

	Another consequence will be that if we ever do try to add client
	side handling of NFS4ERR_REP_TOO_BIG, then we now have to deal
	with the “handle existing buggy server” syndrome.
