kernfs: implement kernfs_ops->atomic_write_len

A write to a kernfs_node is buffered through a kernel buffer.  Writes
<= PAGE_SIZE are performed atomically, while larger ones are executed
in PAGE_SIZE chunks.  While this is enough for sysfs, cgroup which is
scheduled to be converted to use kernfs needs a bit more control over
it.

This patch adds kernfs_ops->atomic_write_len.  If not set (zero), the
behavior stays the same.  If set, writes upto the size are executed
atomically and larger writes are rejected with -E2BIG.

A different implementation strategy would be allowing configuring
chunking size while making the original write size available to the
write method; however, such strategy, while being more complicated,
doesn't really buy anything.  If the write implementation has to
handle chunking, the specific chunk size shouldn't matter all that
much.
