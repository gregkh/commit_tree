arm64: Add boot time configuration of Intermediate Physical Address size

ARMv8 supports a range of physical address bit sizes. The PARange bits
from ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1 register are read during boot-time and the
intermediate physical address size bits are written in the translation
control registers (TCR_EL1 and VTCR_EL2).

There is no change in the VA bits and levels of translation.
