ARM: 8032/1: bL_switcher: fix validation check before its activation

The switcher should not depend on MAX_CLUSTER to determine ifit should
be activated or not. In a multiplatform kernel binary it is possible to
have dual-cluster and quad-cluster platforms configured in. In that case
MAX_CLUSTER which is a build time limit should be 4 and that shouldn't
prevent the switcher from working if the kernel is booted on a b.L
dual-cluster system.

In bL_switcher_halve_cpus() we already have a runtime validation check
to make sure we're dealing with only two clusters, so booting on a quad
cluster system will be caught and switcher activation aborted.

However, the b.L switcher must ensure the MCPM layer is initialized on
the booted hardware before doing anything.  The mcpm_is_available()
function is added to that effect.
