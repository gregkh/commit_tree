drm/i915: Don't WARN nor handle unexpected hpd interrupts on gmch platforms

The status bits are unconditionally set, the control bits only enable
the actual interrupt generation. Which means if we get some random
other interrupts we'll bogusly complain about them.

So restrict the WARN to platforms with a sane hotplug interrupt
handling scheme. And even more important also don't attempt to process
the hpd bit since we've detected a storm already. Instead just clear
the bit silently.

This WARN has been introduced in

    drm/i915: Add messages useful for HPD storm detection debugging (v2)

before that we silently handled the hpd event and so partially
defeated the storm detection.

v2: Pimp commit message (Jani)
