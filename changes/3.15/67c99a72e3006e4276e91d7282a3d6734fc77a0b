[SCSI] hpsa: fix NULL dereference in hpsa_put_ctlr_into_performant_mode()

Initialize local variable trans_support before it is used rather
than after.  It is supposed to contain the value of a register on the
controller containing bits that describe which transport modes the
controller supports (e.g. "performant", "ioaccel1",  "ioaccel2").  A
NULL pointer dereference will almost certainly occur if trans_support
is not initialized at the right point.  If for example the uninitialized
trans_support value does not have the bit set for ioaccel2 support when it
should be, then ioaccel2_alloc_cmds_and_bft() will not get called as it
should be and the h->ioaccel2_blockFetchTable array will remain NULL
instead of being allocated.  Too late, trans_support finally gets
initialized with the correct value with ioaccel2 mode bit set,
which later causes calc_bucket_map() to be called to fill in
h->ioaccel2_blockFetchTable[].  However h->ioaccel2_blockFetchTable
is NULL because it didn't get allocated because earlier trans_support
wasn't initialized at the right point.
