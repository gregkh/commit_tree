Revert "macvlan : fix checksums error when we are in bridge mode"

This reverts commit 12a2856b604476c27d85a5f9a57ae1661fc46019.
The commit above doesn't appear to be necessary any more as the
checksums appear to be correctly computed/validated.

Additionally the above commit breaks kvm configurations where
one VM is using a device that support checksum offload (virtio) and
the other VM does not.
In this case, packets leaving virtio device will have CHECKSUM_PARTIAL
set.  The packets is forwarded to a macvtap that has offload features
turned off.  Since we use CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY, the host does does not
update the checksum and thus a bad checksum is passed up to
the guest.
