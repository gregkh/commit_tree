drm/i915/bdw: Kill ppgtt->num_pt_pages

With the original PPGTT implementation if the number of PDPs was not a
power of two, the number of pages for the page tables would end up being
rounded up. The code actually had a bug here afaict, but this is a
theoretical bug as I don't believe this can actually occur with the
current code/HW..

With the rework of the page table allocations, there is no longer a
distinction between number of page table pages, and number of page
directory entries. To avoid confusion, kill the redundant (and newer)
struct member.
