VME: Stop using memcpy_[to|from]io() due to unwanted behaviour

The ca91cx42 and tsi148 VME bridges use the width of reads and writes on the
PCI bus in part to control the width of the cycles on the VME bus. It is
important that we can control the width of cycles on the VME bus as some VME
hardware requires cycles of a specific width. The memcpy_toio() and
memcpy_fromio() functions do not provide sufficient control, so instead loop
using ioread functions.
