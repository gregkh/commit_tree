usb: gadget: f_fs: Add support for SuperSpeed Mode

Allow userspace to pass SuperSpeed descriptors and
handle them in the driver accordingly.
This change doesn't modify existing desc_header and thereby
keeps the ABI changes backward compatible i.e. existing
userspace drivers compiled with old header (functionfs.h)
would continue to work with the updated kernel.
