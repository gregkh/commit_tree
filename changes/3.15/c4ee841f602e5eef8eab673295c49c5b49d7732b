intel_pstate: add sample time scaling

The PID assumes that samples are of equal time, which for a deferable
timers this is not true when the system goes idle.  This causes the
PID to take a long time to converge to the min P state and depending
on the pattern of the idle load can make the P state appear stuck.

The hold-off value of three sample times before using the scaling is
to give a grace period for applications that have high performance
requirements and spend a lot of time idle,  The poster child for this
behavior is the ffmpeg benchmark in the Phoronix test suite.
