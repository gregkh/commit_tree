mtd: devices: elm: check for hardware engine's design constraints

ELM hardware engine is used by BCH ecc-schemes for detecting and locating ECC
errors. This patch adds the following checks for ELM hardware engine:

 - ELM internal buffers are of 1K,
   so it cannot process data with ecc-step-size > 1K.

 - ELM engine can execute upto maximum of 8 threads in parallel,
   so in *page-mode* (when complete page is processed in single iteration),
   ELM cannot support ecc-steps > 8.
