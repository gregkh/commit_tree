f2fs: add an sysfs entry to control the directory level

This patch adds an sysfs entry to control dir_level used by the large directory.

The description of this entry is:

 dir_level                    This parameter controls the directory level to
			      support large directory. If a directory has a
			      number of files, it can reduce the file lookup
			      latency by increasing this dir_level value.
			      Otherwise, it needs to decrease this value to
			      reduce the space overhead. The default value is 0.
