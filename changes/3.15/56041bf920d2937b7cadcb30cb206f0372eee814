ARM: KVM: fix warning in mmu.c

Compiling with THP enabled leads to the following warning:

arch/arm/kvm/mmu.c: In function ‘unmap_range’:
arch/arm/kvm/mmu.c:177:39: warning: ‘pte’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   if (kvm_pmd_huge(*pmd) || page_empty(pte)) {
                                        ^
Code inspection reveals that these two cases are mutually exclusive,
so GCC is a bit overzealous here. Silence it anyway by initializing
pte to NULL and testing it later on.
