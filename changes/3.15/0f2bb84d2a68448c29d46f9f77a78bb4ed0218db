[SCSI] megaraid: simplify internal command handling

We don't use the passed in scsi command for anything, so just add a adapter-
wide internal status to go along with the internal scb that is used unter
int_mtx to pass back the return value and get rid of all the complexities
and abuse of the scsi_cmnd structure.

This gets rid of the only user of scsi_allocate_command/scsi_free_command,
which can now be removed.
