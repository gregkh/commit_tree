x86/efi: Build our own EFI services pointer table

It's not possible to dereference the EFI System table directly when
booting a 64-bit kernel on a 32-bit EFI firmware because the size of
pointers don't match.

In preparation for supporting the above use case, build a list of
function pointers on boot so that callers don't have to worry about
converting pointer sizes through multiple levels of indirection.
