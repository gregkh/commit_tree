GFS2: Move recovery variables to journal structure in memory

If multiple nodes fail and their recovery work runs simultaneously, they
would use the same unprotected variables in the superblock. For example,
they would stomp on each other's revoked blocks lists, which resulted
in file system metadata corruption. This patch moves the necessary
variables so that each journal has its own separate area for tracking
its journal replay.
