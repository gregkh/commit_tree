xhci: Free streams when they are still allocated on a set_interface call

And warn about this, as that would be a driver bug.

Like wise drivers should ensure that streams are properly free-ed before a
device is reset. So lets warn about that too. This already causes warnings
in the form of:

[   96.982398] xhci_hcd 0000:01:00.0: WARN Can't disable streams for endpoint 0x81
, streams are already disabled!
[   96.982400] xhci_hcd 0000:01:00.0: WARN xhci_free_streams() called with non-streams endpoint

But it is better to also warn about the actual cause of this later warnings.
