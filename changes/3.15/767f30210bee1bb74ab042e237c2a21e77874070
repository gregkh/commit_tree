tile: avoid overflow in ns2cycles

In commit 4cecf6d401a ("sched, x86: Avoid unnecessary overflow in
sched_clock") and in recent patch "clocksource: avoid unnecessary
overflow in cyclecounter_cyc2ns()" https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/3/4/17,
the mult-shift approach is replaced by 2 steps to avoid storing a large,
intermediate value that could overflow.

arch/tile/kernel/time.c has a similar pattern in cycles2ns, and this
copies the same pattern in this function
