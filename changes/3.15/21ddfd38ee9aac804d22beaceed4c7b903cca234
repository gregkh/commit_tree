percpu: renew the max_contig if we merge the head and previous block

During pcpu_alloc_area(), we might merge the current head with the
previous block. Since we have calculated the max_contig using the
size of previous block before we skip it, and now we update the size
of previous block, so we should renew the max_contig.
