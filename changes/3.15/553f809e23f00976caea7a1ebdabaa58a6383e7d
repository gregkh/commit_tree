arm, kvm: fix double lock on cpu_add_remove_lock

Commit 8146875de7d4 (arm, kvm: Fix CPU hotplug callback registration)
holds the lock before calling the two functions:

	kvm_vgic_hyp_init()
	kvm_timer_hyp_init()

and both the two functions are calling register_cpu_notifier()
to register cpu notifier, so cause double lock on cpu_add_remove_lock.

Considered that both two functions are only called inside
kvm_arch_init() with holding cpu_add_remove_lock, so simply use
__register_cpu_notifier() to fix the problem.
