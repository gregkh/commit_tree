MAINTAINERS: Update ARM STi maintainers

This patch adds Maxime and Patrice to ARM/STi maintainers list.
As Stuart Menefy opted to be removed from the list, this patch removes
his email from maintainers. Updated my email with private email address.

This patch also adds few more drivers to the list so that get_maintainer
script can pick the right people to send patch to and avoid email
bounces.
