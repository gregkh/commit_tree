zram: remove good and bad compress stats

Remove `good' and `bad' compressed sub-requests stats.  RW request may
cause a number of RW sub-requests.  zram used to account `good' compressed
sub-queries (with compressed size less than 50% of original size), `bad'
compressed sub-queries (with compressed size greater that 75% of original
size), leaving sub-requests with compression size between 50% and 75% of
original size not accounted and not reported.  zram already accounts each
sub-request's compression size so we can calculate real device compression
ratio.
