block: Use macros from compiler.h instead of __attribute__((...))

To increase compiler portability there are several macros defined
in <linux/compiler.h> for various gcc __attribute((..)) constructs.
I've made sure gcc these specific were replaced with the right
macro and an #include <linux/compiler.h> was placed where needed.
