drm/i915: Fix forcewake counts for gen8

Sometimes generic driver code gets forcewake explicitly by
gen6_gt_force_wake_get(), which check forcewake_count before accessing
hardware. However the register access with gen8_write function access
low level hw accessors directly, ignoring the forcewake_count. This
leads to nested forcewake get from hardware, in ring init and possibly
elsewhere, causing forcewake ack clear errors and/or hangs.

Fix this by checking the forcewake count also in gen8_write

v2: Read side doesn't care about shadowed registers,
    Remove __needs_put funkiness from gen8_write. (Ville)
    Improved commit message.
