parisc: remove _STK_LIM_MAX override

There are only a couple of architectures that override _STK_LIM_MAX to
a non-infinity value. This changes the stack allocation semantics in
subtle ways. For example, GNU make changes its stack allocation to the
hard maximum defined by _STK_LIM_MAX. As a results, threads executed
by processes running under make are allocated a stack size of
_STK_LIM_MAX rather than a sensible default value. This causes various
thread stress tests to fail when they can't muster more than about 50
threads.

The attached change implements the default behavior used by the
majority of architectures.
