drm/i915: Consolidate binding parameters into flags

Anything more than just one bool parameter is just a pain to read,
symbolic constants are much better.

Split out from Chris' vma-binding rework patch.

v2: Undo the behaviour change in object_pin that Chris spotted.

v3: Split out misplaced hunk to handle set_cache_level errors,
spotted by Jani.

v4: Keep the current over-zealous binding logic in the execbuffer code
working with a quick hack while the overall binding code gets shuffled
around.

v5: Reorder the PIN_ flags for more natural patch splitup.

v6: Pull out the PIN_GLOBAL split-up again.
