MIPS: Add cpu_vpe_id macro

The vpe_id field of struct cpuinfo_mips is only present when one of
CONFIG_MIPS_MT_{SMP,SMTC} is enabled. That means that any code accessing
which may compile without MT is currently forced to use an #ifdef.
Instead this patch provides an accessor macro, #ifdef'd appropriately
to prevent further #ifdef's elsewhere.
