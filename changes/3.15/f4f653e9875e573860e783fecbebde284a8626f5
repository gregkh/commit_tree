serial: 8250, disable "too much work" messages

The 8250 driver now reports many of these:
  serial8250: too much work for irq4
These messages turned out to be common these days with a use of
virtualization. I tried to increase the limit of processed characters
in commit e7328ae1848966181a7ac47e8ae6cddbd2cf55f3 (serial: 8250,
increase PASS_LIMIT) in 2011. It was raised from 256 to 512, but it is
still not enough, apparently.

So disable the warning unless somebody turns on DEBUG (or
DYNAMIC_DEBUG _and_ the message).
