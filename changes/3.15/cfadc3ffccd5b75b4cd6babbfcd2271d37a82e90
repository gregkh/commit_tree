iwlwifi: pcie: stop the firmware when we restart it

In case the firmware didn't assert but we want to restart
it, e.g. we didn't get the reply for a host command, or the
Tx queues are stuck, we should stop the firmware by
provoking an interrupt. This allows to better debug the
firmware in these bad scenarios.
