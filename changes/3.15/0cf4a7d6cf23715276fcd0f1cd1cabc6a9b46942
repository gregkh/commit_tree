ahci: disable DEVSLP for Intel Valleyview

On Intel Valleyview SoC, SATA device sleep is not reliable. When
DEVSLP is attempted on certain SSDs, port_devslp write would fail
and result in malfunction of AHCI controller. AHCI controller may
be not shown in PCI enumeration after reset. Complete power source
removal may be required to recover from this failure. So we blacklist
this device and override host device reported capabilities such that
device LPM will only attempt slumber but not DEVSLP.
