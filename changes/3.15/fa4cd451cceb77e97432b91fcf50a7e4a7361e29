sysfs, kobject: add sysfs wrapper for kernfs_enable_ns()

Currently, kobject is invoking kernfs_enable_ns() directly.  This is
fine now as sysfs and kernfs are enabled and disabled together.  If
sysfs is disabled, kernfs_enable_ns() is switched to dummy
implementation too and everything is fine; however, kernfs will soon
have its own config option CONFIG_KERNFS and !SYSFS && KERNFS will be
possible, which can make kobject call into non-dummy
kernfs_enable_ns() with NULL kernfs_node pointers leading to an oops.

Introduce sysfs_enable_ns() which is a wrapper around
kernfs_enable_ns() so that it can be made a noop depending only on
CONFIG_SYSFS regardless of the planned CONFIG_KERNFS.
