tipc: eliminate upcall function pointers between port and socket

Due to the original one-to-many relation between port and user API
layers, upcalls to the API have been performed via function pointers,
installed in struct tipc_port at creation. Since this relation now
always is one-to-one, we can instead use ordinary function calls.

We remove the function pointers 'dispatcher' and Â´wakeup' from
struct tipc_port, and replace them with calls to the renamed
functions tipc_sk_rcv() and tipc_sk_wakeup().

At the same time we change the name and signature of the functions
tipc_createport() and tipc_deleteport() to reflect their new role
as mere initialization/destruction functions.
