Btrfs: correctly flush data on defrag when compression is enabled

When the defrag flag BTRFS_DEFRAG_RANGE_START_IO is set and compression
enabled, we weren't flushing completely, as writing compressed extents
is a 2 steps process, one to compress the data and another one to write
the compressed data to disk.
