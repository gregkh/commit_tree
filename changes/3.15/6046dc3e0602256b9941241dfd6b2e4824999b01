Bluetooth: Auto connection and power on

When hdev is closed (e.g. Mgmt power off command, RFKILL or controller
is reset), the ongoing active connections are silently dropped by the
controller (no Disconnection Complete Event is sent to host). For that
reason, the devices that require HCI_AUTO_CONN_ALWAYS are not added to
hdev->pend_le_conns list and they won't auto connect.

So to fix this issue, during hdev closing, we remove all pending LE
connections. After adapter is powered on, we add a pending LE connection
for each HCI_AUTO_CONN_ALWAYS address.

This way, the auto connection mechanism works propely after a power
off and power on sequence as well as RFKILL block/unblock.
