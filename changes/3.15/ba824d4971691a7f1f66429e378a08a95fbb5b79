spi: rspi: Fix loopback mode for Dual/Quad SPI Transfers

While normal Dual and Quad SPI Transfers are unidirectional, we must do
a bidirectional transfer if loopback mode is enabled, else rx_buf is not
filled.

With spidev it seemed to work, as spidev uses the same buffer for
tranmission and reception.
