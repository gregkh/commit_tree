ALSA: usb-audio: Use standard printk helpers

Convert with dev_err() and co from snd_printk(), etc.
As there are too deep indirections (e.g. ep->chip->dev->dev),
a few new local macros, usb_audio_err() & co, are introduced.

Also, the device numbers in some messages are dropped, as they are
shown in the prefix automatically.
