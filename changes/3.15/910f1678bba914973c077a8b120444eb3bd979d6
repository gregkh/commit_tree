ARM: OMAP2+: use pdata quirks for iommu reset lines

The OMAP iommu driver performs the reset management for the
iommu instances in processor sub-systems using the omap_device
API which are currently supplied as platform data ops. Use pdata
quirks to maintain the functionality as the OMAP iommu driver
gets converted to use DT nodes, until the reset portions are
decoupled from omap_hwmod/omap_device into a separate reset
driver.

This patch adds the pdata quirks for the reset management of
iommus within the DSP (OMAP3 & OMAP4) and IPU subsystems (OMAP4).
