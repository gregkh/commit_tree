hugetlb: ensure hugepage access is denied if hugepages are not supported

Currently, I am seeing the following when I `mount -t hugetlbfs /none
/dev/hugetlbfs`, and then simply do a `ls /dev/hugetlbfs`.  I think it's
related to the fact that hugetlbfs is properly not correctly setting
itself up in this state?:

  Unable to handle kernel paging request for data at address 0x00000031
  Faulting instruction address: 0xc000000000245710
  Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]
  SMP NR_CPUS=2048 NUMA pSeries
  ....

In KVM guests on Power, in a guest not backed by hugepages, we see the
following:

  AnonHugePages:         0 kB
  HugePages_Total:       0
  HugePages_Free:        0
  HugePages_Rsvd:        0
  HugePages_Surp:        0
  Hugepagesize:         64 kB

HPAGE_SHIFT == 0 in this configuration, which indicates that hugepages
are not supported at boot-time, but this is only checked in
hugetlb_init().  Extract the check to a helper function, and use it in a
few relevant places.

This does make hugetlbfs not supported (not registered at all) in this
environment.  I believe this is fine, as there are no valid hugepages
and that won't change at runtime.
