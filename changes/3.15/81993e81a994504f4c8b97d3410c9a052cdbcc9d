compat: Get rid of (get|put)_compat_time(val|spec)

We have two APIs for compatiblity timespec/val, with confusingly
similar names.  compat_(get|put)_time(val|spec) *do* handle the case
where COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME is set, whereas
(get|put)_compat_time(val|spec) do not.  This is an accident waiting
to happen.

Clean it up by favoring the full-service version; the limited version
is replaced with double-underscore versions static to kernel/compat.c.

A common pattern is to convert a struct timespec to kernel format in
an allocation on the user stack.  Unfortunately it is open-coded in
several places.  Since this allocation isn't actually needed if
COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME is true (since user format == kernel format)
encapsulate that whole pattern into the function
compat_convert_timespec().  An equivalent function should be written
for struct timeval if it is needed in the future.

Finally, get rid of compat_(get|put)_timeval_convert(): each was only
used once, and the latter was not even doing what the function said
(no conversion actually was being done.)  Moving the conversion into
compat_sys_settimeofday() itself makes the code much more similar to
sys_settimeofday() itself.

v3: Remove unused compat_convert_timeval().

v2: Drop bogus "const" in the destination argument for
    compat_convert_time*().
