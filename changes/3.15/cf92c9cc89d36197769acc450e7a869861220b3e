staging:dgnc: Replace printk by pr_warn

display warnings to remove the checkpatch.pl warnings:
WARNING: printk() should include KERN_ facility level
and then WARNING: Prefer netdev_warn(netdev, ... then dev_warn(dev,
... then pr_warn(...  to printk(KERN_WARNING ... on adding KERN_WARNING
message designation.
