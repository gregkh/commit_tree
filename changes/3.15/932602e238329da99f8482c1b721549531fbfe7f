fs/compat: convert to COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINE with changing parameter types

Some fs compat system calls have unsigned long parameters instead of
compat_ulong_t.
In order to allow the COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINE macro generate code that
performs proper zero and sign extension convert all 64 bit parameters
their corresponding 32 bit counterparts.

compat_sys_io_getevents() is a bit different: the non-compat version
has signed parameters for the "min_nr" and "nr" parameters while the
compat version has unsigned parameters.
So change this as well. For all practical purposes this shouldn't make
any difference (doesn't fix a real bug).
Also introduce a generic compat_aio_context_t type which can be used
everywhere.
The access_ok() check within compat_sys_io_getevents() got also removed
since the non-compat sys_io_getevents() should be able to handle
everything anyway.
