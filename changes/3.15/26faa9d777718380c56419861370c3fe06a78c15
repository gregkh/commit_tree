ibmveth: Call dev_consume_skb_any instead of dev_kfree_skb.

Replace dev_kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in ibmveth_start_xmit
that can be called in hard irq and other contexts.

In this code path the packet can have either been transmitted
or dropped, dev_consume_skb_any was choosen because that preserves
the existing semantics of the code, and a transmitted packet is
more likely.
