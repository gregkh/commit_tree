xen: add support for MSI message groups

Add support for MSI message groups for Xen Dom0 using the
MAP_PIRQ_TYPE_MULTI_MSI pirq map type.

In order to keep track of which pirq is the first one in the group all
pirqs in the MSI group except for the first one have the newly
introduced PIRQ_MSI_GROUP flag set. This prevents calling
PHYSDEVOP_unmap_pirq on them, since the unmap must be done with the
first pirq in the group.
