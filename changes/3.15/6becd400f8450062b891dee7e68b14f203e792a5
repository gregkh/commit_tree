arch: hexagon: include: asm: add prefix "hvm[ci]_" for all enum members in "hexagon_vm.h"

Append "hvmc_" or "hvmi_" to all related enum members (which are too
common to make conflict with another sub-systems). The related error
with allmodconfig:

    CC [M]  drivers/md/raid1.o
  drivers/md/raid1.c:1440:13: error: 'status' redeclared as different kind of symbol
  arch/hexagon/include/asm/hexagon_vm.h:76:2: note: previous definition of 'status' was here

Also use 'affinity' instead of 'locdis' for __vmintop_affinity().
