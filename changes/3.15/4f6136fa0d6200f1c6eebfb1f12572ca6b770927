ASoC: rx1950_uda1380: Don't modify runtime->hw

Individual components are not supposed to modify the runtime->hw struct itself
as it is manged by the ASoC core. If a component wants to limit the list of
supported rates it should set a rate constraint. The rx1950_uda1380 already does
this, so it is safe to just remove the code that modifies runtime->hw.
