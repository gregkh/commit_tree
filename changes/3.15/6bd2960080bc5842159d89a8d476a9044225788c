mtd: st_spi_fsm: Provide the sequence for enabling 32bit addressing mode

The FSM Serial Flash Controller is driven by issuing a standard set of
register writes we call a message sequence. This patch supplies a method
to prepare the message sequence responsible for setting 32bit addressing
mode on the Flash chip.
