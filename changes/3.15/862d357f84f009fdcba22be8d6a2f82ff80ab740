spi: rspi: Add support for RSPI on RZ/A1H

Add support for the RSPI variant in the RZ/A1H (r7s72100) SoC.

Main differences with RSPI on SH are:
  - Lack of TX only mode, hence we always have to use full duplex
    transfers,
  - The Data Register must be accessed used 8-bit operations.

RSPI on RZ is matched using the new "rspi-rz" platform device name.
