be2net: Fix invocation of be_close() after be_clear()

In the EEH error recovery path, when a permanent failure occurs,
we clean up adapter structure (i.e. destroy queues etc) by calling
be_clear() and return PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT.
After this the stack tries to remove device from bus and calls
be_remove() which invokes netdev_unregister()->be_close().
be_close() operating on destroyed queues results in a
NULL dereference.

This patch fixes this problem by introducing a flag to keep track
of the setup state.
