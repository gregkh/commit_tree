drm/i915: init pm.suspended earlier

Function intel_init_runtime_pm is supposed to start allowing runtime
PM from that point, but it's called very late on the driver
initialization code, to prevent the driver from trying to suspend
while still initializing. The problem is that variables are accessed
earlier than that, so initalize them at intel_pm_setup, which is
supposed to be the correct place.

Notice that this shouldn't fix any specific bugs because dev_priv is
zeroed when allocated, so the value is already correct right from the
start.

v2: - Rebase.
