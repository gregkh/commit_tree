ACPICA: acpidump: Add sparse declarators support.

Linux kernel resident ACPICA headers include some sparse declarators for
kernel static checkers.  This patch adds code to disable them for non
__KERNEL__ defined code so that it is possible for the ACPICA user space
tool's source files to be built with Linux kernel ACPICA header files
included.  Lv Zheng.

Linux kernel build is not affected by this commit.
