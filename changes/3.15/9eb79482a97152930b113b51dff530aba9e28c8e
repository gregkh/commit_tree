ext4: Add support FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE for fallocate

This patch implements fallocate's FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE for Ext4.
 
The semantics of this flag are following:
1) It collapses the range lying between offset and length by removing any data
   blocks which are present in this range and than updates all the logical
   offsets of extents beyond "offset + len" to nullify the hole created by
   removing blocks. In short, it does not leave a hole.
2) It should be used exclusively. No other fallocate flag in combination.
3) Offset and length supplied to fallocate should be fs block size aligned
   in case of xfs and ext4.
4) Collaspe range does not work beyond i_size.
