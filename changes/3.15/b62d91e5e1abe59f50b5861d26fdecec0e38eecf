ARM: OMAP2+: make reset pulse for sbc-t3x usb hubs

sbc-t3x boards features two external USB ports on SB-T35 baseboard.
The baseboardi USB hub reset signal should be de-asserted to make
those ports functional.

sbc-t3517 features additional (assembled on CoM) USB hub which also
requires reset signal handling.

Add quirks code to handle proper reset pulse signal.
