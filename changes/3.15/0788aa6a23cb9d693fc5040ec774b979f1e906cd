x86: Prepare removal of previous_esp from i386 thread_info structure

The i386 thread_info contains a previous_esp field that is used
to daisy chain the different stacks for dump_stack()
(ie. irq, softirq, thread stacks).

The goal is to eventual make i386 handling of thread_info the same
as x86_64, which means that the thread_info will not be in the stack
but as a per_cpu variable. We will no longer depend on thread_info
being able to daisy chain different stacks as it will only exist
in one location (the thread stack).

By moving previous_esp to the end of thread_info and referencing
it as an offset instead of using a thread_info field, this becomes
a stepping stone to moving the thread_info.

The offset to get to the previous stack is rather ugly in this
patch, but this is only temporary and the prev_esp will be changed
in the next commit. This commit is more for sanity checks of the
change.
