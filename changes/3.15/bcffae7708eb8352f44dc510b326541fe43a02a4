xhci: Prevent runtime pm from autosuspending during initialization

xHCI driver has its own pci probe function that will call usb_hcd_pci_probe
to register its usb-2 bus, and then continue to manually register the
usb-3 bus. usb_hcd_pci_probe does a pm_runtime_put_noidle at the end and
might thus trigger a runtime suspend before the usb-3 bus is ready.

Prevent the runtime suspend by increasing the usage count in the
beginning of xhci_pci_probe, and decrease it once the usb-3Â bus is
ready.

xhci-platform driver is not using usb_hcd_pci_probe to set up
busses and should not need to have it's usage count increased during probe.
