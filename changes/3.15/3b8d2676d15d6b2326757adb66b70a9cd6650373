libata: Blacklist queued trim for Crucial M500

Queued trim only works for some users with MU05 firmware.  Revert to
blacklisting all firmware versions.

Introduced by commit d121f7d0cbb8 ("libata: Update queued trim blacklist
for M5x0 drives") which this effectively reverts, while retaining the
blacklisting of M550.

for reports of trouble with MU05 firmware.
