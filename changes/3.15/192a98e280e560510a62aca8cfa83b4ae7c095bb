ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix COEF widget NID for ALC260 replacer fixup

The conversion to a fixup table for Replacer model with ALC260 in
commit 20f7d928 took the wrong widget NID for COEF setups.  Namely,
NID 0x1a should have been used instead of NID 0x20, which is the
common node for all Realtek codecs but ALC260.
