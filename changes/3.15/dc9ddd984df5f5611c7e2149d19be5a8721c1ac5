ext4: remove unused ac_ex_scanned

When looking at a bug report with:

> kernel: EXT4-fs: 0 scanned, 0 found

I thought wow, 0 scanned, that's odd?  But it's not odd; it's printing
a variable that is initialized to 0 and never touched again.

It's never been used since the original merge, so I don't really even
know what the original intent was, either.

If anyone knows how to hook it up, speak now via patch, otherwise just
yank it so it's not making a confusing situation more confusing in
kernel logs.
