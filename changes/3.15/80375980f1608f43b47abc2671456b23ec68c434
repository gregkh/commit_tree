lto: Handle LTO common symbols in module loader

Here is the workaround I made for having the kernel not reject modules
built with -flto.  The clean solution would be to get the compiler to not
emit the symbol.  Or if it has to emit the symbol, then emit it as
initialized data but put it into a comdat/linkonce section.

Minor tweaks by AK over Joe's patch.
