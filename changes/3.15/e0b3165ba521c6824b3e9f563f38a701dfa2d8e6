cpufreq: add 'freq_table' in struct cpufreq_policy

freq table is not per CPU but per policy, so it makes more sense to
keep it within struct cpufreq_policy instead of a per-cpu variable.

This patch does it. Over that, there is no need to set policy->freq_table
to NULL in ->exit(), as policy structure is going to be freed soon.
