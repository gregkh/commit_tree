mwifiex: skipping pending commands after unload

We skip downloading other commands after FUNC_SHUTDOWN is queued
during driver unload. Main thread should be woken up each time
after freeing skipped command so that FUNC_SHUTDOWN gets served
in case if there are other pending commands before FUNC_SHUTDOWN.
Also, call mwifiex_complete_cmd() only for synchronous commands.
