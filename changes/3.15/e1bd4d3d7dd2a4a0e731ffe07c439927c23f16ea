netpoll: Move all receive processing under CONFIG_NETPOLL_TRAP

Make rx_skb_hook, and rx in struct netpoll depend on
CONFIG_NETPOLL_TRAP Make rx_lock, rx_np, and neigh_tx in struct
netpoll_info depend on CONFIG_NETPOLL_TRAP

Make the functions netpoll_rx_on, netpoll_rx, and netpoll_receive_skb
no-ops when CONFIG_NETPOLL_TRAP is not set.

Only build netpoll_neigh_reply, checksum_udp service_neigh_queue,
pkt_is_ns, and __netpoll_rx when CONFIG_NETPOLL_TRAP is defined.

Add helper functions netpoll_trap_setup, netpoll_trap_setup_info,
netpoll_trap_cleanup, and netpoll_trap_cleanup_info that initialize
and cleanup the struct netpoll and struct netpoll_info receive
specific fields when CONFIG_NETPOLL_TRAP is enabled and do nothing
otherwise.
