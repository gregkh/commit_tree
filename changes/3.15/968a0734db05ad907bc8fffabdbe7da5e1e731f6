MIPS: MT: core_nvpes function to retrieve VPE count

This function simply returns the number of VPEs present in the current
core, or 1 if the core does not implement the MT ASE. In SMP kernels
this will typically equal smp_num_siblings, however it will also be
usable in UP kernels and helps prepare for the possibility of a
heterogenous system where the VPE count is not the same across all
cores.
