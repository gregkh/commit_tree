drm/i915: Only copy back the modified fields to userspace from execbuffer

We only want to modifiy a single field in the userspace view of the
execbuffer command buffer, so explicitly change that rather than copy
everything back again.

This serves two purposes:

1. The single fields are much cheaper to copy (constant size so the
copy uses special case code) and much smaller than the whole array.

2. We modify the array for internal use that need to be masked from
the user.

Note: We need this backported since without it the next bugfix will
blow up when userspace recycles batchbuffers and relocations.
