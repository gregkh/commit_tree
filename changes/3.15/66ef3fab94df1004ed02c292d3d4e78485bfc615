MIPS: RC32434: fix broken PCI resource initialization

The parent field of the 'rc32434_res_pci_mem1' resource points to
the resource itself which is obviously wrong. Due to the broken
initialitazion, the PCI devices on the Mikrotik RB532 boards are
not working since commit 22283178 (MIPS: avoid possible resource
conflict in register_pci_controller).

Remove the field initialization to fix the issue.
