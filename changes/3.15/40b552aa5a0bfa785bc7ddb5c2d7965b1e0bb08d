Bluetooth: Enforce strict Secure Connections Only mode security

In Secure Connections Only mode, it is required that Secure Connections
is used for pairing and that the link key is encrypted with AES-CCM using
a P-256 authenticated combination key. If this is not the case, then new
connection shall be refused or existing connections shall be dropped.
