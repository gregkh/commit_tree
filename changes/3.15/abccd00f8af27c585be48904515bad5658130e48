btrfs: Fix 32/64-bit problem with BTRFS_SET_RECEIVED_SUBVOL ioctl

The structure for BTRFS_SET_RECEIVED_IOCTL packs differently on 32-bit
and 64-bit systems. This means that it is impossible to use btrfs
receive on a system with a 64-bit kernel and 32-bit userspace, because
the structure size (and hence the ioctl number) is different.

This patch adds a compatibility structure and ioctl to deal with the
above case.
