ASoC: tlv320aic31xx: Add basic codec driver implementation

This commit adds a bare bones driver support for TLV320AIC31XX family
audio codecs. The driver adds basic stereo playback trough headphone
and speaker outputs and mono capture trough microphone inputs.

The driver is currently missing support at least for mini DSP features
and jack detection. I have tested the driver only on TLV320AIC3111,
but based on the data sheets TLV320AIC3100, TLV320AIC3110, and
TLV320AIC3120 should work Ok too.

The base for the implementation was taken from:
git@gitorious.org:ti-codecs/ti-codecs.git ajitk/topics/k3.10.1-aic31xx
-branch at commit 77504eba0294764e9e63b4a0c696b44db187cd13.
