i40evf: don't store unnecessary array of strings

Since we store the traffic vector names in the queue vector struct, we
don't need to maintain an array of strings for these names in the
adapter structure. Replace this array with a single string and use it
when allocating the misc irq vector.

Also update copyrights.
