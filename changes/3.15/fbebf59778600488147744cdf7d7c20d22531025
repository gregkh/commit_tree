ARM: 8057/1: amba: Add Qualcomm vendor ID.

This patch adds Qualcomm amba vendor Id to the list. This ID is used in mmci driver. The ID selected in same lines like 0x41 is "A" for ARM, 0x51 is "Q" for Qualcomm.

As there are no physical register on Qcom SOC for amba vendor id, this is a fake ID assigned based on "Q" prefix from Qualcomm.
