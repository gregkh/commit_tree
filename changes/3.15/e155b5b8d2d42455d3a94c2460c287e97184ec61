usb: ehci-platform: Return immediately from suspend if ehci_suspend fails

Patch 'b8efdaf USB: EHCI: add check for wakeup/suspend race'
adds a check for possible race between suspend and wakeup interrupt,
and thereby it returns -EBUSY as error code if there's a wakeup
interrupt.
So the platform host controller should not proceed further with
its suspend callback, rather should return immediately to avoid
powering down the essential things, like phy.
