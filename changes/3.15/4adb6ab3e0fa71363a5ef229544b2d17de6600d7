ext4: FIBMAP ioctl causes BUG_ON due to handle EXT_MAX_BLOCKS

When we try to get 2^32-1 block of the file which has the extent
(ee_block=2^32-2, ee_len=1) with FIBMAP ioctl, it causes BUG_ON
in ext4_ext_put_gap_in_cache().

To avoid the problem, ext4_map_blocks() needs to check the file logical block
number. ext4_ext_put_gap_in_cache() called via ext4_map_blocks() cannot
handle 2^32-1 because the maximum file logical block number is 2^32-2.

Note that ext4_ind_map_blocks() returns -EIO when the block number is invalid.
So ext4_map_blocks() should also return the same errno.
