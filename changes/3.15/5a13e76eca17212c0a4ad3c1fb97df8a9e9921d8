ath10k: enable firmware STA quick kickout

Firmware has a feature to track if the associated STA is not acking the frames.
When that happens, the firmware sends WMI_PEER_STA_KICKOUT_EVENTID event to the
host. Enable that to faster detect when a STA has left BSS without sending a
deauth frame.

Also set huge keepalive timeouts to avoid using the keepalive functionality in
the firmware.
