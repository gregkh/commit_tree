cpufreq: powerpc: add cpufreq transition latency for FSL e500mc SoCs

According to the data provided by HW Team, at least 12 internal platform
clock cycles are required to stabilize a DFS clock switch on FSL e500mc Socs.
This patch replaces the CPUFREQ_ETERNAL with appropriate HW clock transition
latency to make DFS governors work normally on Freescale e500mc boards.
