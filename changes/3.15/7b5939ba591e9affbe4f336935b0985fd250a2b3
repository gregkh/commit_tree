qmi_wwan/cdc_ether: move Novatel E371 (1410:9011) to qmi_wwan

This device provides QMI and ethernet functionality via a standard CDC
ethernet descriptor.  But when driven by cdc_ether, the QMI
functionality is unavailable because only cdc_ether can claim the USB
interface. Thus blacklist the device in cdc_ether and add its IDs to
qmi_wwan, which enables both QMI and ethernet simultaneously.
