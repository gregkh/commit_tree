bitops: Fix signedness of compile-time hweight implementations

Enabling '-Wsign-compare' compiler warnings on code that includes
include/linux/bitops.h can generate the following warning:

  In file included from include/linux/kernel.h:10:0,
                    from <random filename>:48:
  include/linux/bitops.h: In function 'hweight_long':
  include/linux/bitops.h:77:26: error: signed and unsigned type in conditional expression [-Werror=sign-compare]

(converted to an error with -Werror)

This is due to the use of the logical negation operator '!' in the
__const_hweight8 macro in include/asm-generic/bitops/const_hweight.h.
The use of that operator here results in a signed value.

Fix by explicitly casting the __const_hweight8 macro expansion to
'unsigned int'.  While here, clean up several checkpatch.pl warnings.
