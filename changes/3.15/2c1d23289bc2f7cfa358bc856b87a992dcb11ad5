ext4: fix removing status extents in ext4_collapse_range()

Currently in ext4_collapse_range() when calling ext4_es_remove_extent() to
remove status extents we're passing (EXT_MAX_BLOCKS - punch_start - 1)
in order to remove all extents from start of the collapse range to the
end of the file. However this is wrong because we might miss the
possible extent covering the last block of the file.

Fix it by removing the -1.
