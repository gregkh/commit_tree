spi: Provide core support for full duplex devices

It is fairly common for SPI devices to require that one or both transfer
directions is always active. Currently drivers open code this in various
ways with varying degrees of efficiency. Start factoring this out by
providing flags SPI_MASTER_MUST_TX and SPI_MASTER_MUST_RX. These will cause
the core to provide buffers for the requested direction if none are
specified in the underlying transfer.

Currently this is fairly inefficient since we actually allocate a data
buffer which may get large, support for mapping transfers using a
scatterlist will allow us to avoid this for DMA based transfers.
