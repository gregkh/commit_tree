blk-mq: fix wrong usage of hctx->state vs hctx->flags

BLK_MQ_F_* flags are for hctx->flags, and are non-atomic and
set at registration time. BLK_MQ_S_* flags are dynamic and
atomic, and are accessed through hctx->state.

Some of the BLK_MQ_S_STOPPED uses were wrong. Additionally,
the header file should not use a bit shift for the _S_ flags,
as they are done through the set/test_bit functions.
