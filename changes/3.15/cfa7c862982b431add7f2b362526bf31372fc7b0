drm/i915: Sanitize the enable_ppgtt module option once

Otherwise we'll end up spamming dmesg on every context creation on snb
with vt-d enabled. This regression was introduced in

    drm/i915: Reorganize intel_enable_ppgtt

As the i915.enable_ppgtt is read-only it cannot be changed after the
module is loaded and so we can perform an early sanitization of the
values.

v2:
- Add comment and pimp commit message (Chris)
- Use the param consistently (Jani)

v3:
- Fix init sequence on pre-gen6 by moving the sanitize_ppgtt call to
  gtt_init. Fixes boot hangs on pre-gen6.
- Add a debug output for the sanitize ppgtt mode.
