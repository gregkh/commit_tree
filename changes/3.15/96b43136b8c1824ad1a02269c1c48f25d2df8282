[media] drx-j: Allow standard selection

ClearQAM is currently not working. Add support for it too.
Unlikely other ATSC tuners, though, this device will not
auto-detect between ATSC and ClearQAM. So, the delivery
system should be properly set.

Also, this frontend seems to also support DVB-C annex A/C. Add
experimental support for them.
