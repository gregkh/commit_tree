sparc64: Give more detailed information in {pgd,pmd}_ERROR() and kill pte_ERROR().

pte_ERROR() is not used anywhere, delete it.

For pgd_ERROR() and pmd_ERROR(), output something similar to x86, giving the address
of the pgd/pmd as well as it's value.

Also provide the caller, since these macros are invoked from pgd_clear_bad() and
pmd_clear_bad() which provides little context as to what high level operation was
occuring when the BAD state was detected.
