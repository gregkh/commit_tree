Bluetooth: Use connection address for reporting connection failures

When reporting connect failed events to userspace, use the address
of the connection and not the address from the HCI event.

This change is strictly speaking not needed since BR/EDR does not
have the concept of resolvable random addresses. It is more for
making the code consistent.
