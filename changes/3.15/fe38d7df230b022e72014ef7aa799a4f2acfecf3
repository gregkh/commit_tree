fuse: fuse_flush() should wait on writeback

The aim of .flush fop is to hint file-system that flushing its state or caches
or any other important data to reliable storage would be desirable now.
fuse_flush() passes this hint by sending FUSE_FLUSH request to userspace.
However, dirty pages and pages under writeback may be not visible to userspace
yet if we won't ensure it explicitly.
