MIPS: More helpful CONFIG_MIPS_CMP label, help text

The prior help text introduced in commit f55afb0969cc "MIPS: Clean up
MIPS MT and CMP configuration options." reads as though this option
enables the kernel to make use of the CM hardware, which is not true.
What it actually does is allow the kernel to interact with the YAMON
bootloader which actually interacts with the CM hardware to bring up
secondary cores. Re-introduce the word "framework" which that commit
removed to avoid misleading people.
