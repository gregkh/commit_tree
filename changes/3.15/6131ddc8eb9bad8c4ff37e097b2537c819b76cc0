Bluetooth: Fix properly ignoring unexpected SMP PDUs

If we didn't request certain pieces of information during the key
distribution negotiation we should properly ignore those PDUs if the
peer incorrectly sends them. This includes the Encryption Information
and Master Identification PDUs if the EncKey bit was not set, and the
Identity Information and Identity Address Information PDUs if the IdKey
bit was not set.
