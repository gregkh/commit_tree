cpufreq: resume drivers before enabling governors

During suspend, we first stop governors and then suspend cpufreq drivers and
resume must be exactly opposite of that. i.e. resume drivers first and then
start governors.

But the current code in resume enables governors first and then resume drivers.
Fix it be changing code sequence there.
