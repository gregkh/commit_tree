ACPICA: Debugger: Add new command to read/write/compare all namespace objects.

This command "test objects" will exercise the entire namespace by
writing new values to each data object, and ensuring that the write
was successful. The original value is then restored and verified.

This patch doesn't affect kernel behavior as the debugger is
currently not shipped in the Linux source tree.
