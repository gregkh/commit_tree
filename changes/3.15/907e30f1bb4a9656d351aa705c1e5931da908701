idle/cpuidle: Split cpuidle_idle_call main function into smaller functions

In order to allow better integration between the cpuidle framework and the
scheduler, reducing the distance between these two sub-components will
facilitate this integration by moving part of the cpuidle code in the idle
task file and, because idle.c is in the sched directory, we have access to
the scheduler's private structures.

This patch splits the cpuidle_idle_call main entry function into 3 calls
to a newly added API:

 1. select the idle state
 2. enter the idle state
 3. reflect the idle state

The cpuidle_idle_call calls these three functions to implement the main
idle entry function.
