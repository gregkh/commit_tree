drm: move drm_put_minor() to drm_minor_free()

_put/get() are used for ref-counting, which we clearly don't do here.
Rename it to _free() and also use the common drm_minor_* prefix.
Furthermore, avoid passing the minor directly but instead use the type
like the other functions do, this allows us to reset the slot.

We also drop the redundant call to drm_unplug_minor() as drm_minor_free()
is only used from paths were that has already be called.
