GFS2: Plug on AIL flush

When we do a flush of the AIL list, we are writing out what is
likely to be a lot of small I/Os, which are possibly in an order
which is not ideal performance-wise. Since this is done by calling
filemap_fdatatwrite for each individual inode's address space there
is no overall plugging going on.

In addition to that, we do not always wait for AIL i/o when we flush
it, so that it is possible for things to get left behind on the queue.
By adding explicit plugging here, we reduce the chances of this
being an issues. A quick test using the AIL flush tracepoint shows a
small, but measurable improvement.
