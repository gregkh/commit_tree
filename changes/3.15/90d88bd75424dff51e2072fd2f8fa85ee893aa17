workqueue: Remove deprecated __cancel_delayed_work()

__cancel_delayed_work() was deprecated by 136b5721d75a ("workqueue:
deprecate __cancel_delayed_work()") as cancel_delayed_work() was
updated so that it could be used from all contexts.  Enough time has
passed since the deprecation.  Let's remove it.
