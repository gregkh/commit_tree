metag: Remove _STK_LIM_MAX override

Meta overrode _STK_LIM_MAX (the default RLIMIT_STACK hard limit) to
256MB, apparently in an attempt to prevent setup_arg_pages's
STACK_GROWSUP code from choosing the maximum stack size of 1GB, which is
far too large for Meta's limited virtual address space and hits a BUG_ON
(stack_top is usually 0x3ffff000).

However the commit "metag: Reduce maximum stack size to 256MB" reduces
the absolute stack size limit to a safe value for metag. This allows the
default _STK_LIM_MAX override to be removed, bringing the default
behaviour in line with all other architectures. Parisc in particular
recently removed their override of _STK_LIMT_MAX in commit e0d8898d76a7
(parisc: remove _STK_LIM_MAX override) since it subtly affects stack
allocation semantics in userland. Meta's uapi/asm/resource.h can now be
removed and switch to using generic-y.
