[SCSI] hpsa: only do device rescan for certain events

Do no rescan on every events -- way too many rescans are
triggered if we don't filter the events.  Limit rescans
to be triggered by the following set of events:

 * controller state change
 * enclosure hot plug
 * physical drive state change
 * logical drive state change
 * redundant controller state change
 * accelerated io enabled/disabled
 * accelerated io configuration change
