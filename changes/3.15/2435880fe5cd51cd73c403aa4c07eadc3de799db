checkpatch: add checks for constant non-octal permissions

umode_t permissions are sometimes mistakenly written with decimal
constants.  Verify that numeric permissions are using octal.

Add a list of the most commonly used functions and macros that have
umode_t permissions and the argument position.

Add a $Octal type to $Constant.
Allow $LvalOrFunc to be a pointer indirection too.
