Revert "powerpc/powernv: hwmon driver for power values, fan rpm and temperature"

This reverts commit 0de7f8a917b5202014430e0055c0e1db0348bd62.

This driver wasn't merged via the proper maintainers (my fault ... ooops !)
and has serious issues so let's take it out for now and have a new better
one be merged the right way
