[media] of: move graph helpers from drivers/media/v4l2-core to drivers/of

This patch moves the parsing helpers used to parse connected graphs
in the device tree, like the video interface bindings documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt, from
drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-of.c into drivers/of/base.c.

This allows to reuse the same parser code from outside the V4L2
framework, most importantly from display drivers.
The functions v4l2_of_get_next_endpoint, v4l2_of_get_remote_port,
and v4l2_of_get_remote_port_parent are moved. They are renamed to
of_graph_get_next_endpoint, of_graph_get_remote_port, and
of_graph_get_remote_port_parent, respectively.
Since there are not that many current users yet, switch all of
them to the new functions right away.
