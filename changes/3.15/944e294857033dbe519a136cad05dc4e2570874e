netpoll: Only call ndo_start_xmit from a single place

Factor out the code that needs to surround ndo_start_xmit
from netpoll_send_skb_on_dev into netpoll_start_xmit.

It is an unfortunate fact that as the netpoll code has been maintained
the primary call site ndo_start_xmit learned how to handle vlans
and timestamps but the second call of ndo_start_xmit in queue_process
did not.

With the introduction of netpoll_start_xmit this associated logic now
happens at both call sites of ndo_start_xmit and should make it easy
for that to continue into the future.
