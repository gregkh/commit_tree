rbd: fix error paths in rbd_img_request_fill()

Doing rbd_obj_request_put() in rbd_img_request_fill() error paths is
not only insufficient, but also triggers an rbd_assert() in
rbd_obj_request_destroy():

    Assertion failure in rbd_obj_request_destroy() at line 1867:

    rbd_assert(obj_request->img_request == NULL);

rbd_img_obj_request_add() adds obj_requests to the img_request, the
opposite is rbd_img_obj_request_del().  Use it.
