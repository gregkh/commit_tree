futex: update documentation for ordering guarantees

Commits 11d4616bd07f ("futex: revert back to the explicit waiter
counting code") and 69cd9eba3886 ("futex: avoid race between requeue and
wake") changed some of the finer details of how we think about futexes.
One was a late fix and the other a consequence of overlooking the whole
requeuing logic.

The first change caused our documentation to be incorrect, and the
second made us aware that we need to explicitly add more details to it.
