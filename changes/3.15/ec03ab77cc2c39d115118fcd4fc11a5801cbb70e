staging: rtl8188eu: remove spaces, correct counts to unbreak P2P ioctls

It looks like someone did a search-and-replace on that driver, putting
spaces before "=" characters, without checking this is OK everywhere.
Also, in some places, there's memcpm()s/strncmp()s checking for some
different length than the fixed string argument.

These things result in code not working as intended. Fix that.
