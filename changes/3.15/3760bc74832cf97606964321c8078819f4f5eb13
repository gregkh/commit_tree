ALSA: hda/conexant - Disable static quirks

Now all weird setups have been converted to fixups for the generic
parser, and we can disable the static quirks.  This commit just turns
the build off.  The bulky static quirk code still remains for a while,
in case we get an overlooked regression.  It'll be removed at the next
kernel version.
