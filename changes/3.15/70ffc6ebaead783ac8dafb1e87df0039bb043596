sparc64: Fix top-level fault handling bugs.

Make get_user_insn() able to cope with huge PMDs.

Next, make do_fault_siginfo() more robust when get_user_insn() can't
actually fetch the instruction.  In particular, use the MMU announced
fault address when that happens, instead of calling
compute_effective_address() and computing garbage.
