bonding: remove bond->lock from bond_arp_rcv

We're always called with rcu_read_lock() held (bond_arp_rcv() is only
called from bond_handle_frame(), which is rx_handler and always called
under rcu from __netif_receive_skb_core() ).

The slave active/passive and/or bonding params can change in-flight, however
we don't really care about that - we only modify the last time packet was
received, which is harmless.
