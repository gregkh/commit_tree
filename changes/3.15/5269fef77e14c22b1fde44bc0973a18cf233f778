[media] v4l: ti-vpe: Set correct field parameter for output and capture buffers

The vpe driver wasn't setting the correct field parameter for dequed CAPTURE
type buffers for the case where the captured output is progressive.

Set the field to V4L2_FIELD_NONE for the completed destination buffers when
the captured output is progressive.

For OUTPUT type buffers, a queued buffer's field is forced to V4L2_FIELD_NONE
if the pixel format(configured through s_fmt for the buffer type
V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_OUTPUT_MPLANE specifies) the field type isn't interlaced.
If the pixel format specified was V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE, and the queued buffer's
field isn't V4L2_FIELD_TOP or V4L2_FIELD_BOTTOM, the vb2 buf_prepare op returns
an error.

This ensures compliance, and that the dequeued output and captured buffers
contain the field type that the driver used internally.
