drm: Add support for two-ended allocation, v3

Clients like i915 need to segregate cache domains within the GTT which
can lead to small amounts of fragmentation. By allocating the uncached
buffers from the bottom and the cacheable buffers from the top, we can
reduce the amount of wasted space and also optimize allocation of the
mappable portion of the GTT to only those buffers that require CPU
access through the GTT.

For other drivers, allocating small bos from one end and large ones
from the other helps improve the quality of fragmentation.

Based on drm_mm work by Chris Wilson.

v3: Changed to use a TTM placement flag
v2: Updated kerneldoc
