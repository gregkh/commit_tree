ARM: imx: add cpuidle support for i.mx6sl

Add cpuidle support for i.MX6SL, currently only support
two cpuidle levels(ARM wfi and WAIT mode), and add software
workaround for WAIT mode errata as below:

ERR005311 CCM: After exit from WAIT mode, unwanted interrupt(s) taken
          during WAIT mode entry process could cause cache memory
          corruption.

Software workaround:
    To prevent this issue from occurring, software should ensure that
the ARM to IPG clock ratio is less than 12:5 (that is < 2.4x), before
entering WAIT mode.
