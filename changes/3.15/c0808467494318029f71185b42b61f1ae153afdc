Input: edt-ft5x06 - adjust delays to conform datasheet

The FT5x06 datasheet specifies a minimum reset width of 5ms and a
delay between deassertion of reset and start of reporting of 300ms.
Adjust the delays to conform to the datasheet.

With the original delays I sometimes experienced communication
timeouts when initializing the controller.
