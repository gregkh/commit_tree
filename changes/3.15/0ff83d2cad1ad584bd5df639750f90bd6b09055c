i2c: exynos5: remove unnecessary cast of void pointer

Remove unnecessary cast of void pointer, because 'algo_data' of
'struct i2c_adapter' is a void pointer. Casting the void pointer
is redundant. The conversion from void pointer to any other
pointer type is guaranteed by the C programming language.
