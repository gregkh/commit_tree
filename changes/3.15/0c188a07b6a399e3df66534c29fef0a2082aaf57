perf probe: Fix a segfault if asked for variable it doesn't find

Fix a segfault bug by asking for variable it doesn't find.
Since the convert_variable() didn't handle error code returned
from convert_variable_location(), it just passed an incomplete
variable field and then a segfault was occurred when formatting
the field.

This fixes that bug by handling success code correctly in
convert_variable(). Other callers of convert_variable_location()
are correctly checking the return code.

This bug was introduced by following commit. But another hidden
erroneous error handling has been there previously (-ENOMEM case).
