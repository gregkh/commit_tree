perf session: Change header.misc dump from decimal to hex

When printing the raw dump of a data file, the header.misc is
printed as a decimal.  Unfortunately, that field is a bit mask, so
it is hard to interpret as a decimal.

Print in hex, so the user can easily see what bits are set and more
importantly what type of info it is conveying.
