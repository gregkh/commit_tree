x86, threadinfo: Redo "x86: Use inline assembler to get sp"

This patch restores the changes of commit dff38e3e93 "x86: Use inline
assembler instead of global register variable to get sp". They got lost
in commit 198d208df4 "x86: Keep thread_info on thread stack in x86_32"
while moving the code to arch/x86/kernel/irq_32.c.

Quoting Andi from commit dff38e3e93:

"""
LTO in gcc 4.6/47. has trouble with global register variables. They were
used to read the stack pointer. Use a simple inline assembler statement
with a mov instead.

This also helps LLVM/clang, which does not support global register
variables.
