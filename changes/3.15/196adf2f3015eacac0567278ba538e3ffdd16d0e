arm64: Remove pgprot_dmacoherent()

Since this macro is identical to pgprot_writecombine() and is only used
in a single place, remove it completely to avoid confusion. On ARMv7+
processors, the coherent DMA mapping must be Normal NonCacheable (a.k.a.
writecombine) to avoid mismatched hardware attribute aliases (with the
kernel linear mapping as Normal Cacheable).
