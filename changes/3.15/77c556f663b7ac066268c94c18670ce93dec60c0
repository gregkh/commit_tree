drbd: Add struct drbd_resource

In a first step, each resource has exactly one connection, and both objects are
allocated at the same time.  The final result will be one resource and zero or
more connections.

Only allow to delete a resource if all its connections are C_STANDALONE.
Stop the worker threads of all connections early enough.
