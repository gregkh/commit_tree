drm/i915/ppgtt: Fix ioctl errno for "no such context"

Without this fix the ioctls silently succeeded (but actually did
nothing).

It makes all the code which calls into this function way too confusing.

v2: Fix destroy IOCTL as well

v3: Clarify the other two callers of i915_gem_context_get() to never
check for NULL. (Mika)
