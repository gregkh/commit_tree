x86, vdso: Remove compat vdso support

The compat vDSO is a complicated hack that's needed to maintain
compatibility with a small range of glibc versions.

This removes it and replaces it with a much simpler hack: a config
option to disable the 32-bit vDSO by default.

This also changes the default value of CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO to n --
users configuring kernels from scratch almost certainly want that
choice.
