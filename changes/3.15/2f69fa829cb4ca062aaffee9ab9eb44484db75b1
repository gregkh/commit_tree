percpu: allocation size should be even

723ad1d90b56 ("percpu: store offsets instead of lengths in ->map[]")
updated percpu area allocator to use the lowest bit, instead of sign,
to signify whether the area is occupied and forced min align to 2;
unfortunately, it forgot to force the allocation size to be even
causing malfunctions for the very rare odd-sized allocations.

Always force the allocations to be even sized.
