vmcore: continue vmcore initialization if PT_NOTE is found empty

Currently when an empty PT_NOTE is detected, vmcore initialization
fails.  It sounds too harsh.  Because PT_NOTE could be empty, for
example, one offlined a cpu but never restarted kdump service, and after
crash, PT_NOTE program header is there but no data contains.  It's
better to warn about the empty PT_NOTE and continue to initialise
vmcore.

And ultimately the multiple PT_NOTE are merged into a single one, all
empty PT_NOTE are discarded naturally during the merge.  So empty
PT_NOTE is not visible to user space and vmcore is as good as expected.
