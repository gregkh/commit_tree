drm/i915: Implement command buffer parsing logic

The command parser scans batch buffers submitted via execbuffer ioctls before
the driver submits them to hardware. At a high level, it looks for several
things:

1) Commands which are explicitly defined as privileged or which should only be
   used by the kernel driver. The parser generally rejects such commands, with
   the provision that it may allow some from the drm master process.
2) Commands which access registers. To support correct/enhanced userspace
   functionality, particularly certain OpenGL extensions, the parser provides a
   whitelist of registers which userspace may safely access (for both normal and
   drm master processes).
3) Commands which access privileged memory (i.e. GGTT, HWS page, etc). The
   parser always rejects such commands.

See the overview comment in the source for more details.

This patch only implements the logic. Subsequent patches will build the tables
that drive the parser.
