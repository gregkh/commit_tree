KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add transactional memory support

This adds saving of the transactional memory (TM) checkpointed state
on guest entry and exit.  We only do this if we see that the guest has
an active transaction.

It also adds emulation of the TM state changes when delivering IRQs
into the guest.  According to the architecture, if we are
transactional when an IRQ occurs, the TM state is changed to
suspended, otherwise it's left unchanged.
