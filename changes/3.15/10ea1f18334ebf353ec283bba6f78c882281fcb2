ARM: dts: Add GPS_ALIVE power domain for exynos4x12

This patch add GPS_ALIVE power domain for Exynos4x12 SoC. GPS_ALIVE power domain
include GPS_BLK for GPS IP. Exynos SoC used generic power-domain driver to
control power domain. After completed kernel booting, Exynos power-domain driver
disable un-used power domain to reduce power-consumption/leak.

If GPS_ALIVE power domain isn't registered to Exynos power-domain driver,
happen power-leakage because GPS_ALIVE_CONFIGURATION is default power on state.

- 0x10023D00 : GPS_ALIVE_CONFIGURATION register address
