ASoC: Intel: Cancel hsw_notification_work before freeing the stream

I suppose there is a possibility that hsw_notification_work() may run after
sst_hsw_stream_free() which can lead to a kernel crash since struct
sst_hsw_stream is freed at that point and
stream = container_of(work, struct sst_hsw_stream, notify_work) is not valid
when hsw_notification_work() is run.
