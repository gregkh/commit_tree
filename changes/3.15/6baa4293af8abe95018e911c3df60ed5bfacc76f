Btrfs: correctly determine if blocks are shared in btrfs_compare_trees

Just comparing the pointers (logical disk addresses) of the btree nodes is
not completely bullet proof, we have to check if their generation numbers
match too.

It is guaranteed that a COW operation will result in a block with a different
logical disk address than the original block's address, but over time we can
reuse that former logical disk address.

For example, creating a 2Gb filesystem on a loop device, and having a script
running in a loop always updating the access timestamp of a file, resulted in
the same logical disk address being reused for the same fs btree block in about
only 4 minutes.

This could make us skip entire subtrees when doing an incremental send (which
is currently the only user of btrfs_compare_trees). However the odds of getting
2 blocks at the same tree level, with the same logical disk address, equal first
slot keys and different generations, should hopefully be very low.
