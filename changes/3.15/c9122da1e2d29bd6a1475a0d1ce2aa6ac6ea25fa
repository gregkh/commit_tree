locking: Move mcs_spinlock.h into kernel/locking/

The mcs_spinlock code is not meant (or suitable) as a generic locking
primitive, therefore take it away from the normal includes and place
it in kernel/locking/.

This way the locking primitives implemented there can use it as part
of their implementation but we do not risk it getting used
inapropriately.
