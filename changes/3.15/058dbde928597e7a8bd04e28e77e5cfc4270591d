staging: android: lowmemorykiller: neglect swap cached pages in other_file

With ZRAM enabled it is observed that lowmemory killer
doesn't trigger properly. swap cached pages are
accounted in NR_FILE, and lowmemorykiller considers
this as reclaimable and adds to other_file. But these
pages can't be reclaimed unless lowmemorykiller triggers.
So subtract swap pages from other_file.
