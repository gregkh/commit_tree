fanotify: remove useless bypass_perm check

The prepare_for_access_response() function checks whether
group->fanotify_data.bypass_perm is set.  However this test can never be
true because prepare_for_access_response() is called only from
fanotify_read() which means fanotify group is alive with an active fd
while bypass_perm is set from fanotify_release() when all file
descriptors pointing to the group are closed and the group is going
away.
