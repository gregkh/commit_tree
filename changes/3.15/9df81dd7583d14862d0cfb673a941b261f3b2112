net: phy: allow PHY drivers to implement their own software reset

As pointed out by Shaohui, most 10G PHYs out there have a non-standard
compliant software reset sequence, eventually something much more
complex than just toggling the BMCR_RESET bit. Allow PHY driver to
implement their own soft_reset() callback to deal with that. If no
callback is provided, call into genphy_soft_reset() which makes sure the
existing behavior is kept intact.
