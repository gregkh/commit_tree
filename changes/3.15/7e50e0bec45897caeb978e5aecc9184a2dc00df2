uas: Avoid unnecessary unlock / lock calls around unlink_data_urbs

All callers of unlink_data_urbs drop devinfo->lock before calling it, and
then immediately take it again after the call. And the first thing
unlink_data_urbs does is take the lock again, and the last thing it does
is drop it. This commit removes all the unnecessary lock dropping and taking.
