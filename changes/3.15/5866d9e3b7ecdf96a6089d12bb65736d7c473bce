Input: wacom - use full 32-bit HID Usage value in switch statement

A HID Usage is a 32-bit value: an upper 16-bit "page" and a lower 16-bit
ID. While the two halves are normally reported seperately, only the
combination uniquely idenfifes a particular HID Usage.

The existing code performs the comparison in two steps, first performing a
switch on the ID and then verifying the page within each case. While this
works fine, it is very akward to handle two Usages that share a single ID,
such as HID_USAGE_PRESSURE and HID_USAGE_X because the case statement can
only have a single identifier.

To work around this, we now check the full 32-bit HID Usage directly rather
than first checking the ID and then the page.  This allows the switch
statement to have distinct cases for e.g. HID_USAGE_PRESSURE and
HID_USAGE_X.
