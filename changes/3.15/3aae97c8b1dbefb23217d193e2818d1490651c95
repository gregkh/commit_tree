ARM: trusted_foundations: fix compile error on non-SMP

The setup_max_cpus variable is only defined if CONFIG_SMP is set. Add
a preprocessor condition to avoid the following compilation error if
CONFIG_SMP is not set:

    arch/arm/include/asm/trusted_foundations.h: In function 'register_trusted_foundations':
    arch/arm/include/asm/trusted_foundations.h:57:2: error: 'setup_max_cpus' undeclared (first use in this function)
