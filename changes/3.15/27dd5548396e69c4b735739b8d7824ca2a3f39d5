Staging: unisys: uislib: Fix locking in info_proc_read_helper()

Make sure BusListLock is unlocked before returning.  If an error is encountered
early on in info_proc_read_helper() the function can return without unlocking.

Also changed the PROCLINE macro so that it doesn't include a goto statement.
