zram: propagate error to user

When we initialized zcomp with single, we couldn't change
max_comp_streams without zram reset but current interface doesn't show
any error to user and even it changes max_comp_streams's value without
any effect so it would make user very confusing.

This patch prevents max_comp_streams's change when zcomp was initialized
as single zcomp and emit the error to user(ex, echo).
