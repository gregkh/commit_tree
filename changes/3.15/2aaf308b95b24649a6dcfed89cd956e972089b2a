rapidio: rework device hierarchy and introduce mport class of devices

This patch removes an artificial RapidIO bus root device and establishes
actual device hierarchy by providing reference to real parent devices.
It also introduces device class for RapidIO controller devices (on-chip
or an eternal bridge, known as "mport").

Existing implementation was sufficient for SoC-based platforms that have
a single RapidIO controller.  With introduction of devices using
multiple RapidIO controllers and PCIe-to-RapidIO bridges the old scheme
is very limiting or does not work at all.  The implemented changes allow
to properly reference platform's local RapidIO mport devices and provide
device details needed for upper layers.

This change to RapidIO device hierarchy does not break any known
existing kernel or user space interfaces.
