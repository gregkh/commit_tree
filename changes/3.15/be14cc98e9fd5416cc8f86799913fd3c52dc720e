vlan: use use ether_addr_equal_64bits to instead of ether_addr_equal

Ether_addr_equal_64bits is more efficient than ether_addr_equal, and
can be used when each argument is an array within a structure that
contains at least two bytes of data beyond the array, so it is safe
to use it for vlan, and make sense for fast path.
