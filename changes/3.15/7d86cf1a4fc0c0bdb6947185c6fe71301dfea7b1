drm: inline drm_minor_get_id()

We can significantly simplify this helper by using plain multiplication.
Note that we converted the minor-type to an enum earlier so this didn't
work before.

We also fix a minor range-bug here: the limit argument of idr_alloc() is
*exclusive*, not inclusive, so we should use 64 instead of 63 as offset.
