Btrfs: fix possible empty list access when flushing the delalloc inodes

We didn't have a lock to protect the access to the delalloc inodes list, that is
we might access a empty delalloc inodes list if someone start flushing delalloc
inodes because the delalloc inodes were moved into a other list temporarily.
Fix it by wrapping the access with a lock.
