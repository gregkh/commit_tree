gpio: Driver for SYSCON-based GPIOs

SYSCON driver was designed for using memory areas (registers)
that are used in several subsystems. There are systems (CPUs)
which use bits in one register for various purposes and thus
should be handled by various kernel subsystems. This driver
allows you to use the individual SYSCON bits as GPIOs.
ARM CLPS711X SYSFLG1 input lines has been added as first user
of this driver.
