pwm: atmel: correct CDTY calculation

From the datasheet, the actual duty cycle is:

	(period - (1 / clk) * CDTY) / period

This actually correct the polarity of the PWM and solves the issue that
pwm-leds exhibits: when setting a duty cycle of 0 and then disabling a
channel, the level was wrong (1 when the polarity was normal and 0 when
the polarity was inversed).
