iio: cm36651: Fix i2c client leak and possible NULL pointer dereference

During probe the driver allocates dummy I2C devices (i2c_new_dummy())
but they aren't unregistered during driver remove or probe failure.

Additionally driver does not check the return value of i2c_new_dummy().
In case of error (i2c_new_device(): memory allocation failure or I2C
address cannot be used) this function returns NULL which is later
dereferenced by i2c_smbus_{read,write}_data() functions.

Fix issues by properly checking for i2c_new_dummy() return value and
unregistering I2C devices on driver remove or probe failure.
