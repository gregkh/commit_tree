s390/kvm: support collaborative memory management

This patch enables Collaborative Memory Management (CMM) for kvm
on s390. CMM allows the guest to inform the host about page usage
(see arch/s390/mm/cmm.c). The host uses this information to avoid
swapping in unused pages in the page fault handler. Further, a CPU
provided list of unused invalid pages is processed to reclaim swap
space of not yet accessed unused pages.
