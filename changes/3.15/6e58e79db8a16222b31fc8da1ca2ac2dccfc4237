introduce copy_page_to_iter, kill loop over iovec in generic_file_aio_read()

generic_file_aio_read() was looping over the target iovec, with loop over
(source) pages nested inside that.  Just set an iov_iter up and pass *that*
to do_generic_file_aio_read().  With copy_page_to_iter() doing all work
of mapping and copying a page to iovec and advancing iov_iter.

Switch shmem_file_aio_read() to the same and kill file_read_actor(), while
we are at it.
