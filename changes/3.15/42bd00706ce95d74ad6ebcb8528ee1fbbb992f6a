pinctrl-baytrail: add function mux checking in gpio pin request

The requested gpio pin must has the func_pin_mux field set
to GPIO function by BIOS/FW in advanced. Else, the gpio pin
request would fail. This is to ensure that we do not expose
any gpio pins which shall be used for alternate functions,
for eg: wakeup pin, I/O interfaces for LPSS, etc.
