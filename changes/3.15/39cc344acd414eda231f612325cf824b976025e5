drm/doc: Add PRIME function references

For giant hilarity the DocBook reference overview is only generated
when in a level 2 section, not in a level 3 section. So we need to
move this up a bit as a side-by-side section to the main PRIME
documentation.

Whatever.

To have a complete set of references add the missing kerneldoc for all
functions exported to modules with the exception of the file private
init/destroy functions - drivers have no business calling those, so
let's just drop the EXPORT_SYMBOL instead.

Also reflow the function parameters to align correctly and break at 80
chars - my OCD couldn't stand them while writing the kerneldoc ;-)
