[media] nuvoton-cir: Activate PNP device when probing

On certain motherboards (mainly Intel NUC series) bios keeps the
Nuvoton CIR device disabled at boot.

This patch adds a call to kernel PNP layer to activate the device if it
is not already activated. This will improve the chances of the PNP probe
actually succeeding on Intel NUC platforms.
