mtd: st_spi_fsm: Supply framework for device requests

The FSM hardware works by setting a predetermined sequence of register
writes. Rather than open coding them inside each functional block we're
going to define them in a series of formatted 'sequence structures'.
This patch provides the framework which shall be used for every action.
