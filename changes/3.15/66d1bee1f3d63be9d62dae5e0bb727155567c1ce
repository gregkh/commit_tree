tilepro: Call dev_consume_skb_any instead of kfree_skb.

Replace kfree_skb with dev_consume_skb_any in tile_net_tx and
tile_net_tx_tso which can be called in hard irq and other contexts.

At the point where the skbs are freed a packet has been successfully
transmitted so dev_consume_skb_any is the appropriate variant to use.
