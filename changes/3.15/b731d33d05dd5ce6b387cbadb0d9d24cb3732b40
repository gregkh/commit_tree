drm/i915: relax context alignment

With the introduction of contexts per fd in the future, one can easily
envision more contexts being used. We do not have an easy remedy to
reduce the space requirements of the contexts, we can make things
slightly better by using less stringent alignments on later hardware.

Ville: Since I can almost predict you'll point this out. I can no longer
find the docs which specify the 64k requirement on certain gen6 SKUs. If
you'd like to change that too, be my guest.
