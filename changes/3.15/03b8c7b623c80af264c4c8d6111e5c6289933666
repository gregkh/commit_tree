futex: Allow architectures to skip futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() test

If an architecture has futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() implemented and there
is no runtime check necessary, allow to skip the test within futex_init().

This allows to get rid of some code which would always give the same result,
and also allows the compiler to optimize a couple of if statements away.
