tick: Remove code duplication in tick_handle_periodic()

tick_handle_periodic() is calling ktime_add() at two places, first before the
infinite loop and then at the end of infinite loop. We can rearrange code a bit
to fix code duplication here.

It looks quite simple and shouldn't break anything, I guess :)
