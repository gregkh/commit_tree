uas: Fix memory management

The scsi-host structure is refcounted, scsi_remove_host tears down the
scsi-host but does not decrement the refcount, so we need to call
scsi_put_host on disconnect to get the underlying memory to be freed.

After calling scsi_remove_host, the scsi-core may still hold a reference to
the scsi-host, iow we may still get called after uas_disconnect, but we
do our own life cycle management of uas_devinfo, freeing it on disconnect,
and thus may end up using devinfo after it has been freed. Switch to letting
scsi_host_alloc allocate and manage the memory for us.
