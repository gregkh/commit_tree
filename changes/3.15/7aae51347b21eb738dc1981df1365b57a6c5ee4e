[SCSI] sd: don't fail if the device doesn't recognize SYNCHRONIZE CACHE

Evidently some wacky USB-ATA bridges don't recognize the SYNCHRONIZE
CACHE command, as shown in this email thread:

The fact that we can't tell them to drain their caches shouldn't
prevent the system from going into suspend.  Therefore sd_sync_cache()
shouldn't return an error if the device replies with an Invalid
Command ASC.
