[SCSI] scsi_debug: fix resp_xdwriteread() return value when running out of memory

When resp_xdwriteread() can't allocate temporary buffer, it returns -1.
But the return value is used as scsi status code and -1 is not
interpreted as correct code.

target_core_mod has similar xdwriteread emulation code. So this mimics
what target_core_mod does for xdwriteread when running out of memory.
