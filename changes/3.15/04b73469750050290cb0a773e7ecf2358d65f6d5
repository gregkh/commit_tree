PM / sleep: Move prototype declaration to header file kernel/power/power.h

Move prototype declaration of function to header file
kernel/power/power.h because it is used by more than one file.

This eliminates the following warning in kernel/power/snapshot.c:

kernel/power/snapshot.c:1588:16: warning: no previous prototype for ‘swsusp_save’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
