ALSA: hda - Fix CORB reset to follow specification

According to the HDA spec, we must write 1 to bit 15 on a CORBRP
reset, read back 1, then write 0, then read back 0. This must be
done while the DMA is not running.

We accidentaly ended up writing back the 0 by using a writel
instead of a writew to CORBWP.

This caused occasional controller failure on Bay Trail hardware.
