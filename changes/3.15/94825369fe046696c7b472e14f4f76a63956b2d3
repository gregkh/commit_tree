drm/i915: Drop WaDisablePSDDualDispatchEnable:ivb for IVB GT2

Both Bspec and the W/A database state that WaDisablePSDDualDispatchEnable
is only needed for IVB GT1.

The only real confusion here is that the the W/A database also says to
write to the GT2 only register as well, which is strange if the W/A is
only for GT1.
