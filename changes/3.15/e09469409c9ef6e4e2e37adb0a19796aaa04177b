staging: comedi: pcl818: consolidate the common interrupt code

The DMA, FIFO, and EOC interrupt handler functions, that are called by
the _real_ interrupt function, always return IRQ_HANDLED. Change the
return type for these functions to void and move the final return to
the real interrupt function.

Change the parameters to the handler functions to the comedi_device and
comedi_subdevice pointers.

At some point in the handler functions the interrupt request is cleared.
Move this to the real interrupt function.

Also at some point in the handlers, comedi_event() is called to pass any
events to the comedi subsystem. Move this to the real interrupt function
also.

For aesthetics, and to clarify the code, rename the interrupt function and
the handler functions.
