ASoC: Intel: sst-acpi: Fix Oops in case of missing firmware

I swear I tested missing firmware in commit e5161d7987f1 ("ASoC: Intel:
sst-acpi: Request firmware before SST platform driver probing").

Unfortunately same wasn't done in commit 6dda27cbbd1d ("ASoC: Intel:
sst-acpi: Add support for multiple machine drivers per platform") which
will cause NULL pointer dereference in sst_acpi_fw_cb() when printing the
error since sst_acpi->mach is not set.

Fix this obvious error by setting the sst_acpi->mach in sst_acpi_probe().
