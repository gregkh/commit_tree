locks: make locks_mandatory_area check for file-private locks

Allow locks_mandatory_area() to handle file-private locks correctly.
If there is a file-private lock set on an open file and we're doing I/O
via the same, then that should not cause anything to block.

Handle this by first doing a non-blocking FL_ACCESS check for a
file-private lock, and then fall back to checking for a classic POSIX
lock (and possibly blocking).

Note that this approach is subject to the same races that have always
plagued mandatory locking on Linux.
