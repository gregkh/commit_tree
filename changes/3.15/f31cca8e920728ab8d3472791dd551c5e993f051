staging: r8188eu: Remove union wrapping of recv_frame

We have now removed everthing from the union except the struct. The union
can be deleted, the struct renamed, and the referencing of members of the
struct becomes a lot simpler.

Some, but not all, of the problems noted by checkpatch.pl have been fixed.
