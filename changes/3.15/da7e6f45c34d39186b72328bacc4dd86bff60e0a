time: Change the return type of clockevents_notify() to integer

The broadcast framework can potentially be made use of by archs which do not have an
external clock device as well. Then, it is required that one of the CPUs need
to handle the broadcasting of wakeup IPIs to the CPUs in deep idle. As a
result its local timers should remain functional all the time. For such
a CPU, the BROADCAST_ENTER notification has to fail indicating that its clock
device cannot be shutdown. To make way for this support, change the return
type of tick_broadcast_oneshot_control() and hence clockevents_notify() to
indicate such scenarios.
