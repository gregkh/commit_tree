MAINTAINERS: Reorder maintainer addresses for PM and ACPI

For a few subsystems I am the person who actually applies patches
and people don't CC me on patch submissions, because my address is
not the first one in the given MAINTAINERS item.

Reorder PM and ACPI maintainer addresses in MAINTAINERS to make
the probability of that a bit smaller.
