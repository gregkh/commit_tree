w1: fix netlink refcnt leak on error path

If the message type is W1_MASTER_CMD or W1_SLAVE_CMD, then a reference
is taken when searching for the slave or master device.  If there
isn't any following data m->len (mlen is a copy) is 0 and packing up
the message for later execution is skipped leaving nothing to
decrement the reference counts.

Way back when, m->len was checked before the search that increments the
reference count, but W1_LIST_MASTERS has no additional data, the check
was moved in 9be62e0b2fadaf5ff causing this bug.

This change reorders to put the check before the reference count is
incremented avoiding the problem.
