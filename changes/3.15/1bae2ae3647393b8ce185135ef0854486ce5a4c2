rtlwifi: rtl8723be: rtl8723com: Remove unused allow_all_destaddr functions

In a previous commit, Peter Wu removed this call as configure_filter takes care
of setting/clearing RCR_AAP. This patch makes the same change for rtl8723be.

In addition, a change is made in the logging level for one debug printout.
