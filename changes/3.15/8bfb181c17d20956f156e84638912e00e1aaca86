ALSA: Embed card device into struct snd_card

As prepared in the previous patch, we are ready to create a device
struct for the card object in snd_card_create() now.  This patch
changes the scheme from the old style to:

- embed a device struct for the card object into snd_card struct,
- initialize the card device in snd_card_create() (but not register),
- registration is done in snd_card_register() via device_add()

The actual card device is stored in card->card_dev.  The card->dev
pointer is kept unchanged and pointing to the parent device as before
for compatibility reason.
