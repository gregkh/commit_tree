Staging: unisys: Clean multiple sparse warnings

Cleaned up multiple sparse warnings, mostly due to improper access of I/O
space.  Also declared functions and variables that were only used locally
as static.

Removed ULTRA_disp_channel_header(), ULTRA_disp_channel(),
ULTRA_disp_vnic_channel() because they were never called.
