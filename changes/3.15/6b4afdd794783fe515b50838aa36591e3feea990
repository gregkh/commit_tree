f2fs: introduce f2fs_issue_flush to avoid redundant flush issue

Some storage devices show relatively high latencies to complete cache_flush
commands, even though their normal IO speed is prettry much high. In such
the case, it needs to merge cache_flush commands as much as possible to avoid
issuing them redundantly.
So, this patch introduces a mount option, "-o flush_merge", to mitigate such
the overhead.

If this option is enabled by user, F2FS merges the cache_flush commands and then
issues just one cache_flush on behalf of them. Once the single command is
finished, F2FS sends a completion signal to all the pending threads.

Note that, this option can be used under a workload consisting of very intensive
concurrent fsync calls, while the storage handles cache_flush commands slowly.
