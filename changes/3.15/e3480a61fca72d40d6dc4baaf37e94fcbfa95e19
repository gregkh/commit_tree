Input: uinput - add UI_GET_SYSNAME ioctl to retrieve the sysfs path

uinput is used in the xorg-integration-tests suite and in the wayland
test suite. These automated tests suites create many virtual input
devices and then hook something to read these newly created devices.

Currently, uinput does not provide the created input device, which means
that we rely on an heuristic to guess which input node was created.
The problem is that is heuristic is subjected to races between different
uinput devices or even with physical devices. Having a way to retrieve
the sysfs path allows us to find without any doubts the event node.
