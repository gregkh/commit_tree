powerpc/perf: Add BHRB constraint and IFM MMCRA handling for EBB

We want a way for users of EBB (Event Based Branches) to also access the
BHRB (Branch History Rolling Buffer). EBB does not interoperate with our
existing BHRB support, which is wired into the generic Linux branch
stack sampling support.

To support EBB & BHRB we add three new bits to the event code. The first
bit indicates that the event wants access to the BHRB, and the other two
bits indicate the desired IFM (Instruction Filtering Mode).

We allow multiple events to request access to the BHRB, but they must
agree on the IFM value. Events which are not interested in the BHRB can
also interoperate with events which do.

Finally we program the desired IFM value into MMCRA. Although we do this
for every event, we know that the value will be identical for all events
that request BHRB access.
