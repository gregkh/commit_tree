tcp: do not leak non zero tstamp in output packets

Usage of skb->tstamp should remain private to TCP stack
(only set on packets on write queue, not on cloned ones)

Otherwise, packets given to loopback interface with a non null tstamp
can confuse netif_rx() / net_timestamp_check()

Other possibility would be to clear tstamp in loopback_xmit(),
as done in skb_scrub_packet()
