net: Find the nesting level of a given device by type.

Multiple devices in the kernel can be stacked/nested and they
need to know their nesting level for the purposes of lockdep.
This patch provides a generic function that determines a nesting
level of a particular device by its type (ex: vlan, macvlan, etc).
We only care about nesting of the same type of devices.

For example:
  eth0 <- vlan0.10 <- macvlan0 <- vlan1.20

The nesting level of vlan1.20 would be 1, since there is another vlan
in the stack under it.
