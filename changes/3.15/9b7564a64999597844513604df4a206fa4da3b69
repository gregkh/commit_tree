ALSA: hda - Inform the unexpectedly ignored pins by auto-parser

The auto-parser may ignore some pins that could be valid when they
don't match with the assumption or if there are way too many pins
assigned to the same output type.  So far, such a pin has been
silently ignored, but it's better to leave a message, which would help
for debugging and understanding the problem.
