MIPS: MIPS_CMP should depend upon !SMTC, not upon SMVP

Commit f55afb0969cc "MIPS: Clean up MIPS MT and CMP configuration
options." introduced a dependency upon MIPS_MT_SMP (ie. SMVP) for the
MIPS_CMP (ie. CMP framework support) Kconfig option. It did not specify
why, and that dependency is bogus. It is perfectly valid to have a
multi-core system with the YAMON bootloader but without MT support -
an example of this would be any multi-core proAptiv bitstream running on
a Malta. Forcing MT support to be enabled in a kernel for such a system
is incorrect. I suspect that the dependency was actually meant to
reflect the fact that YAMON will only bind 1 TC per VPE on an MT system,
and only describe those 1:1 TC:VPE pairs as CPUs through the AMON
interface. Thus an SMTC kernel makes little sense on a system using
MIPS_CMP, and the Kconfig dependencies should reflect that rather than
introducing the bogus SMVP dependency.
