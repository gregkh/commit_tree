locks: rename locks_remove_flock to locks_remove_file

This function currently removes leases in addition to flock locks and in
a later patch we'll have it deal with file-private locks too. Rename it
to locks_remove_file to indicate that it removes locks that are
associated with a particular struct file, and not just flock locks.
