x86, vdso: Make the vdso linker script compatible with Gold

Gold can't parse the script due to:
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16804

With a workaround in place for that issue, Gold 2.23 crashes due to:
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15355

This works around the former bug and avoids the second by removing
the unnecessary vvar and hpet sections and segments.  The vdso and
hpet symbols are still there, and nothing needed the sections or
segments.
