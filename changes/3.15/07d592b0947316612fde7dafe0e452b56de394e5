arch: hexagon: include: asm: add "vga.h" in Kbuild

Need include generic "vga.h", or can not pass compiling with
allmodconfig, the related error:

    CC [M]  drivers/gpu/drm/drm_irq.o
  In file included from include/linux/vgaarb.h:34:0,
                   from drivers/gpu/drm/drm_irq.c:42:
  include/video/vga.h:22:21: fatal error: asm/vga.h: No such file or directory

Also move "preempt.h" upper to match sort order.
