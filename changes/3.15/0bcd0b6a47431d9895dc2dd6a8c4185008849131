watchdog: it87_wdt: Work around non-working CIR interrupts

On some hardware platforms, the it87_wdt watchdog resets the machine
despite the watchdog daemon running and writing to /dev/watchdog.

This is due to Consumer IR buffer underrun interrupts being used as
triggers to reset the timer.  On some buggy hardware implementations
such as the iEi AFL-12A-N270 single-board computer, this method does
not work.

However, resetting the timer by writing its original timeout value in
its configuration register over and over again suppresses the unwanted
reboots.

Add a module option (nocir), 0 by default in order not to break existing
setups.  Setting it to 1 enables the workaround.

Fixes bug #42801 <https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42801>.
Tested primarily on Linux 3.5.7, applies cleanly on Linux 3.13.5.
