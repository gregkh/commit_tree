lto, workaround: Add workaround for initcall reordering

Work around a LTO gcc problem: when there is no reference to a variable
in a module it will be moved to the end of the program. This causes
reordering of initcalls which the kernel does not like.
Add a dummy reference function to avoid this. The function is
deleted by the linker.

This replaces a previous much slower workaround.

Thanks to Jan "Honza" Hubička for suggesting this technique.
