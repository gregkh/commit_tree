rcutorture: Add dryrun capability

Actual rcutorture tests take considerable time and machine resources,
so it is inconvenient to actually do an rcutorture run when optimizing
the bin-packing algorithm.  This commit therefore adds a --dryrun
argument, which defaults to doing a run, but for which "sched"
says to simply print the run schedule and "script" dumps the script
without running it.
