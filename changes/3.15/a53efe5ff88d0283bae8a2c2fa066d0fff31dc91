sched/mm: call finish_arch_post_lock_switch in idle_task_exit and use_mm

The finish_arch_post_lock_switch is called at the end of the task
switch after all locks have been released. In concept it is paired
with the switch_mm function, but the current code only does the
call in finish_task_switch. Add the call to idle_task_exit and
use_mm. One use case for the additional calls is s390 which will
use finish_arch_post_lock_switch to wait for the completion of
TLB flush operations.
