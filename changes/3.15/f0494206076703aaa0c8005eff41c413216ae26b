ceph: fix ceph_dir_llseek()

Comparing offset with inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes doesn't make sense for
directory. For a fragmented directory, offset (frag_t, off) can be
larger than inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes.

At the very beginning of ceph_dir_llseek(), local variable old_offset
is initialized to parameter offset. This doesn't make sense neither.
Old_offset should be ceph_make_fpos(fi->frag, fi->next_offset).
