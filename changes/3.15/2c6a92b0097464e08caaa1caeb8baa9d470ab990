btrfs: wake up transaction thread upon remount

Now that we can adjust the commit interval with a remount, we need
to wake up the transaction thread or else he will continue to sleep
until the previous transaction interval has elapsed before waking
up.  So, if we go from a large commit interval to something smaller,
the transaction thread will not wake up until the large interval has
expired.  This also causes the cleaner thread to stay sleeping, since
it gets woken up by the transaction thread.

Fix it by simply waking up the transaction thread during a remount.
