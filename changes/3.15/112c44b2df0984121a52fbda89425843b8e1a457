mac80211: fix WPA with VLAN on AP side with ps-sta again

commit de74a1d9032f4d37ea453ad2a647e1aff4cd2591
  "mac80211: fix WPA with VLAN on AP side with ps-sta"
fixed an issue where queued multicast packets would
be sent out encrypted with the key of an other bss.

commit "7cbf9d017dbb5e3276de7d527925d42d4c11e732"
  "mac80211: fix oops on mesh PS broadcast forwarding"
essentially reverted it, because vif.type cannot be AP_VLAN
due to the check to vif.type in ieee80211_get_buffered_bc before.

As the later commit intended to fix the MESH case, fix it
by checking for IFTYPE_AP instead of IFTYPE_AP_VLAN.
