MIPS: Regenerate malta defconfigs

This patch simply regenerates the malta defconfigs such that they don't
change after being used & saved as a defconfig again. ie. it is the
result of running the following:

for cfg in arch/mips/configs/malta*; do
	ARCH=mips make `basename ${cfg}`
	ARCH=mips make savedefconfig
	mv -v defconfig ${cfg}
done
