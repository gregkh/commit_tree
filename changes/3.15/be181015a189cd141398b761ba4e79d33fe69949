batman-adv: fix reference counting imbalance while sending fragment

In the new fragmentation code the batadv_frag_send_packet()
function obtains a reference to the primary_if, but it does
not release it upon return.

This reference imbalance prevents the primary_if (and then
the related netdevice) to be properly released on shut down.

Fix this by releasing the primary_if in batadv_frag_send_packet().
