sched/fair: Optimize cgroup pick_next_task_fair()

Since commit 2f36825b1 ("sched: Next buddy hint on sleep and preempt
path") it is likely we pick a new task from the same cgroup, doing a put
and then set on all intermediate entities is a waste of time, so try to
avoid this.

Measured using:

  mount nodev /cgroup -t cgroup -o cpu
  cd /cgroup
  mkdir a; cd a
  mkdir b; cd b
  mkdir c; cd c
  echo $$ > tasks
  perf stat --repeat 10 -- taskset 1 perf bench sched pipe

PRE :      4.542422684 seconds time elapsed   ( +-  0.33% )
POST:      4.389409991 seconds time elapsed   ( +-  0.32% )

Which shows a significant improvement of ~3.5%
