ARM: OMAP5: Switch to THUMB mode if needed on secondary CPU

On my DRA7 system, when the kernel is built in Thumb-2 mode, the secondary CPU
(Cortex A15) fails to come up causing SMP boot on second CPU to timeout. This
seems to be because the CPU is in ARM mode once the ROM hands over control to
the kernel.  Switch to Thumb-2 mode if required once the kernel is control of
secondary CPU. On OMAP4 on the other hand, it appears to be in Thumb-2 mode on
entry so this is not required and SMP boot works as is.

Also corrected a spurious '+' and updated copyright information.
