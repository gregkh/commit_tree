iwlwifi: mvm: Enable power save on BSS and P2P client in DCM

New FW enables support for power save on BSS and P2P client MACs
simultaneously when they function on different channels (DCM).
Enable this case in the driver after examining new TLV flag -
IWL_UCODE_TLV_FLAGS_BSS_P2P_PS_DCM. Still power management is not
allowed on both MACs if they function on a same channel.
Remove another redundant TLV flag - IWL_UCODE_TLV_FLAGS_P2P_PS that
is not in use anymore. Remove bound_vif_cnt as redundant.
