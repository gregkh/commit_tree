dm: raid fix write_mostly arg validation

Fix off-by-one error in validation of write_mostly.

The user-supplied value given for the 'write_mostly' argument must be an
index starting at 0.  The validation of the supplied argument failed to
check for 'N' ('>' vs '>='), which would have caused an access beyond the
end of the array.
