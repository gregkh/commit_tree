md/raid5: move more common code into handle_stripe

Apart from 'prexor' which can only be set for RAID5, and
'qd_idx' which can only be meaningful for RAID6, these two
chunks of code are nearly the same.

So combine them into one adding a test to call either
handle_parity_checks5 or handle_parity_checks6 as appropriate.
