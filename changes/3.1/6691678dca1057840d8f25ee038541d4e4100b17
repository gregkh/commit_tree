iwlwifi: use pci_dev->revision, again

Commit ff938e43d39e926de74b32a3656c190f979ab642 (net: use pci_dev->revision,
again) already converted this driver to using the 'revision' field of 'struct
pci_dev' but commit 084dd79172cb3aad11d2b7ee5628d57badca7c6e (iwlagn: move PCI
related operations from probe and remove to PCI layer) has again added the code
to read the PCI revision ID register...
