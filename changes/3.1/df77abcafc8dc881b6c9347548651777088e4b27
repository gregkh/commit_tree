ARM: 7099/1: futex: preserve oldval in SMP __futex_atomic_op

The SMP implementation of __futex_atomic_op clobbers oldval with the
status flag from the exclusive store. This causes it to always read as
zero when performing the FUTEX_OP_CMP_* operation.

This patch updates the ARM __futex_atomic_op implementations to take a
tmp argument, allowing us to store the strex status flag without
overwriting the register containing oldval.
