iwlagn: fix command queue timeout

If the command queue is constantly busy,
which can happen in P2P, the hangcheck
timer will frequently find a command in
it and will eventually reset the device
because nothing sets the timestamp for
this queue when commands are processed.

Fix this by setting the timestamp when
a command completes.
