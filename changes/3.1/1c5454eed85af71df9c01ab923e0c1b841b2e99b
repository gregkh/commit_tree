Change Ryan Mallon's email address across the kernel

I no longer work at Bluewater Systems. Update my email address accordingly. I
have deleted my email address from C files rather than change it. This
was suggested by several people, since the commit from my new email
address will cause scripts/get_maintainer.pl to function properly. I
have not added the .mailmap entry as suggested by Joe because I think
it is no longer necessary if I touch all the files which had my name
in them.
