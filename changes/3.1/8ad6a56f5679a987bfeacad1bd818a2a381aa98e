block: Don't check QUEUE_FLAG_SAME_COMP in __blk_complete_request

In __blk_complete_request, we check both QUEUE_FLAG_SAME_COMP and req->cpu
to decide whether we should use req->cpu. Actually the user can also
select the complete cpu by either setting BIO_CPU_AFFINE or by calling
bio_set_completion_cpu. Current solution makes these 2 ways don't work
any more. So we'd better just check req->cpu.
