hwmon: Driver for NTC Thermistors

Add support for NTC Thermistor series. In this release, the
following thermistors are supported: NCP15WB473, NCP18WB473, NCP03WB473,
and NCP15WL333. This driver is based on the datasheet of MURATA.

The driver in the patch does conversion from the raw ADC value
(either voltage or resistence) to temperature. In order to use
voltage values as input, the circuit schematics should be provided
with the platform data. A compensation table for each type of thermistor
is provided for the conversion.
