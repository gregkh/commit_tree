microblaze: Get early printk console earlier

1. Register early console as standard console
2. Enable CON_BOOT console flag to ensure auto-unregistering by the kernel
3. remap_early_printk function remap physical console baseaddr to virtual space

Usage specific function for console remap is done after memory initialization
with IRQ turn off that's why there is not necessary to protect it.

The reason for remapping is that the kernel use TLB 63 for 1:1 address mapping
to be able to use console in very early boot-up phase. But allocating one TLB
just for console caused performance degression that's why ioremaps create new
mapping and TLB 63 is automatically released and ready to use.
