xfs: remove confusing ail cursor wrapper

xfs_trans_ail_cursor_set() doesn't set the cursor to the current log
item, it sets it to the next item. There is already a function for
doing this - xfs_trans_ail_cursor_next() - and the _set function is
simply a two line wrapper.  Remove it and open code the setting of
the cursor in the two locations that call it to remove the
confusion.
