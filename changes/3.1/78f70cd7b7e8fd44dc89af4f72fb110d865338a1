xfs: cleanup the definition of struct xfs_dir2_sf_entry

Remove the inumber member which is at a variable offset after the actual
name, and make name a real variable sized C99 array instead of the incorrect
one-sized array which confuses (not only) gcc.  Based on this clean up
the helpers to calculate the entry size.
