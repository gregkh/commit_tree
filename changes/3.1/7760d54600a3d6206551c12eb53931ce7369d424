ARM: 7005/1: freshen up mm/proc-arm946.S

The file mm/proc-arm946.S contains a typo and is missing a structure
member in __arm946_proc_info.  The former prevents compilation
and the latter causes problems during boot.  It is likely this
file was manually copied from a similar file and not tested, then
later updates to the *_proc_info structures missed this file.

This patch will apply (with offset) with or without the
recent macro unification work that has been done in this directory.
This was verified against linux-next/stable last week.
