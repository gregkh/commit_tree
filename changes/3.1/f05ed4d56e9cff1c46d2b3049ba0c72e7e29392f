KVM: PPC: Split out code from book3s.c into book3s_pr.c

In preparation for adding code to enable KVM to use hypervisor mode
on 64-bit Book 3S processors, this splits book3s.c into two files,
book3s.c and book3s_pr.c, where book3s_pr.c contains the code that is
specific to running the guest in problem state (user mode) and book3s.c
contains code which should apply to all Book 3S processors.

In doing this, we abstract some details, namely the interrupt offset,
updating the interrupt pending flag, and detecting if the guest is
in a critical section.  These are all things that will be different
when we use hypervisor mode.
