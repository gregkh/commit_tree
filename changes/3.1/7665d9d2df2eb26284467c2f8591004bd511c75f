ARM: proc: add proc info for Cortex-A15MP using classic page tables

Multicore implementations of the Cortex-A15 require bit 6 of the
auxiliary control register to be set in order for cache and TLB
maintenance operations to be broadcast between CPUs.

This patch adds a new proc_info structure for Cortex-A15, which enables
the SMP bit during setup and includes the new HWCAP for integer
division.
