tmpfs: miscellaneous trivial cleanups

While it's at its least, make a number of boring nitpicky cleanups to
shmem.c, mostly for consistency of variable naming.  Things like "swap"
instead of "entry", "pgoff_t index" instead of "unsigned long idx".

And since everything else here is prefixed "shmem_", better change
init_tmpfs() to shmem_init().
