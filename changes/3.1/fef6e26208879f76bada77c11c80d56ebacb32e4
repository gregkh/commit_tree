xen/pci: Shuffle code around.

The file is hard to read. Move the code around so that
the contents of it follows a uniform format:
 - setup GSIs - PV, HVM, and initial domain case
 - then MSI/MSI-x setup - PV, HVM and then initial domain case.
 - then MSI/MSI-x teardown - same order.
 - lastly, the __init functions in PV, HVM, and initial domain order.
