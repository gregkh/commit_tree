x86: don't include xen/xen.h in <asm/io.h> unless XEN is enabled

Dmitry Kasatkin reports:
  "kernel-devel package with kernel headers have no <include/xen>
   directory if XEN is disabled.  Modules which inclide asm/io.h won't
   compile.

   XEN related content is behind the CONFIG_XEN flag in the io.h.  And
   <xen/xen.h> should be also behind CONFIG_XEN flag."

So move the include of <xen/xen.h> down into the section that is
conditional on CONFIG_XEN.
