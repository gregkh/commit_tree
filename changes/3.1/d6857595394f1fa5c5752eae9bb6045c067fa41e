[SCSI] dh_rdac: Associate HBA and storage in rdac_controller to support partitions in storage

rdac hardware handler assumes that there is one-to-one relation ship
between the host and the controller w.r.t lun.  IOW, it does not
support "multiple storage partitions" within a storage.

Example:
HBA1 and HBA2 see lun 0 and 1 in storage A (1)
HBA3 and HBA4 see lun 0 and 1 in storage A (2)
HBA5 and HBA6 see lun 0 and 1 in storage A (3)

luns 0 and 1 in (1), (2) and (3) are totally different.

But, rdac handler treats the lun 0s (and lun 1s) as the same when
sending a mode select to the controller, which is wrong.

This patch makes the rdac hardware handler associate HBA and the
storage w.r.t lun (and not the host itself).
