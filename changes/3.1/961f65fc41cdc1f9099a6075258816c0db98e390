sparc: Size mondo queues more sanely.

There is currently no upper limit on the mondo queue sizes we'll use,
which guarentees that we'll eventually his page allocation limits, and
thus allocation failures, due to MAX_ORDER.

Cap the sizes sanely, current limits are:

CPU  MONDO	2 * max_possible_cpus
DEV  MONDO	256 (basically NR_IRQS)
RES  MONDO	128
NRES MONDO	4
