ipv4: some rt_iif -> rt_route_iif conversions

As rt_iif represents input device even for packets
coming from loopback with output route, it is not an unique
key specific to input routes. Now rt_route_iif has such role,
it was fl.iif in 2.6.38, so better to change the checks at
some places to save CPU cycles and to restore 2.6.38 semantics.

compare_keys:
	- input routes: only rt_route_iif matters, rt_iif is same
	- output routes: only rt_oif matters, rt_iif is not
		used for matching in __ip_route_output_key
	- now we are back to 2.6.38 state

ip_route_input_common:
	- matching rt_route_iif implies input route
	- compared to 2.6.38 we eliminated one rth->fl.oif check
	because it was not needed even for 2.6.38

compare_hash_inputs:
	Only the change here is not an optimization, it has
	effect only for output routes. I assume I'm restoring
	the original intention to ignore oif, it was using fl.iif
	- now we are back to 2.6.38 state
