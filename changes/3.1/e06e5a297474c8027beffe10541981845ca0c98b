ALSA: hda - Defer mixer element creation to the right time in patch_via.c

The jack-detect control should be created at the time of build_controls
callback instead of calling snd_hda_add_ctls() at the tree-parsing time.
For that, copy the control to the temporary array like other cases.

Also, fixed typos of vt1708_jack_detect in all places.
