PTI feature to allow user to name and mark masterchannel request.

This feature addition provides a new parameter in
pti_request_masterchannel() to allow the user
to provide their own name to mark the request when
the trace is viewed in a PTI SW trace viewer
(like MPTA).  If a name is not provided and
NULL is provided, the 'current' process name is used.
API function header documentation documents this.
