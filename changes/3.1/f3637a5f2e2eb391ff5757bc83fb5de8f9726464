irq: Always set IRQF_ONESHOT if no primary handler is specified

If no primary handler is specified then a default one is assigned
which always returns IRQ_WAKE_THREAD. This handler requires the
IRQF_ONESHOT flag on LEVEL / EIO typed irqs because the source of
interrupt is not disabled. Since it is required for those users and
there is no difference for others it makes sense to add this flag
unconditionally.
