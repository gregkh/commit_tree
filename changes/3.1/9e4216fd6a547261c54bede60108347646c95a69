iio: light sensor: Fix a panic in the tsl2563 driver.

Add the required read/write_raw functions to the tsl2563_info_no_irq data
structure.  This structure is used insted of tsl2563_info when the I2C client
has no IRQ.
The absence of these functions causes a panic when reading or writing the
created sysfs files.
