ARM: S3C64XX: Ensure VIC based IRQs can be resumed from

Any interrupts based off either of the onboard VICs cannot be resumed
from any more as it seems set_irq_wake() is now checking the error code
returned from the low level handlers and not setting the wake-state on
the interrupt if this fails.

Ensure that we make the interrupts we can resume from available on the
VIC and then do a pre-sleep mask of all the VIC interrupts as the wakeup
is handled by a seperate block.
