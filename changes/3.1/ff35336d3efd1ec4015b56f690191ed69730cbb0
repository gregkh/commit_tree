OMAP: omap_device: only override _noirq methods, not normal suspend/resume

Commit c03f007a8bf0e092caeb6856a5c8a850df10b974 (OMAP: PM:
omap_device: add system PM methods for PM domain handling) mistakenly
used SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS() when trying to configure custom methods
for the PM domains noirq methods.  Fix that by setting only the
suspend_noirq and resume_noirq methods with custom versions.

Note that all other PM domain methods (including the "normal"
suspend/resume methods) are populated using USE_PLATFORM_PM_SLEEP_OPS,
which configures them all to the default subsystem (platform_bus)
methods.
