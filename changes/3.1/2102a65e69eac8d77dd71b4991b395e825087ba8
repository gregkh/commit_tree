ARM: 7008/1: alignment: Make SIGBUS sent to userspace POSIXly correct

With the UM_SIGNAL alignment fault mode, no siginfo structure is
passed to userspace.

POSIX specifies how siginfo_t should be populated for alignment
faults, so this patch does just that:

  * si_signo = SIGBUS
  * si_code = BUS_ADRALN
  * si_addr = misaligned data address at which access was attempted
