[SCSI] bnx2fc: Support 'sequence cleanup' task

For the devices that support sequence level error recovery, based on the REC
response, the firmware has to be informed about the offset from which the
retransmission should happen. Driver initiates sequence cleanup task to
firmware so that the firmware can program the task. Upon the sequence cleanup
completion, SRR is issued to retransmit the sequence.
