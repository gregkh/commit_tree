[media] V4L: ov9740: Fixed some settings

Based on vendor feedback, should issue a software reset at start of day.

Also, OV9740_ANALOG_CTRL15 needs to be changed so the sensor does not begin
streaming until it is ready (otherwise, results in a nonsense frame for the
initial frame).

Added a comment on using discontinuous clock.

Finally, OV9740_ISP_CTRL19 needs to be changed to really use YUYV ordering
(the previous value was for VYUY).
