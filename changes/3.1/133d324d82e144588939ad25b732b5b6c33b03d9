hwmon: (w83627ehf) Fix negative 8-bit temperature values

Since 8-bit temperature values are now handled in 16-bit struct
members, values have to be cast to s8 for negative temperatures to be
properly handled. This is broken since kernel version 2.6.39
(commit bce26c58df86599c9570cee83eac58bdaae760e4.)
