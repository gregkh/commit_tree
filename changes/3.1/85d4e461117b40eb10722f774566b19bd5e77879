Btrfs: make a lockdep class for each root

This patch was originally from Tejun Heo.  lockdep complains about the btrfs
locking because we sometimes take btree locks from two different trees at the
same time.  The current classes are based only on level in the btree, which
isn't enough information for lockdep to figure out if the lock is safe.

This patch makes a class for each type of tree, and lumps all the FS trees that
actually have files and directories into the same class.
