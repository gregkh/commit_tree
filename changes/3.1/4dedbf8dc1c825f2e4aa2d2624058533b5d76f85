sparc64: kill page table quicklists

With the recent mmu_gather changes that included generic RCU freeing of
page-tables, it is now quite straightforward to implement gup_fast() on
sparc64.

This patch:

Remove the page table quicklists.  They are pointless and make it harder
to use RCU page table freeing and share code with other architectures.

BTW, this is the second time this has happened, see commit 3c936465249f
("[SPARC64]: Kill pgtable quicklists and use SLAB.")
