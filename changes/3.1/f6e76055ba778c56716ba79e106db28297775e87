[SCSI] hpsa: retry commands completing with status of UNSOLICITED_ABORT

In a shared SAS setup, target devices may be reset by one of
several hosts, and outstanding commands on that device will be
completed to corresponding hosts with status of UNSOLICITED_ABORT.
Such commands should be retried instead of being treated as i/o
errors.  Also fixed a nearby spelling error.
