ipv6: Do not leave router anycast address for /127 prefixes.

Original commit 2bda8a0c8af... "Disable router anycast
address for /127 prefixes" says:

|   No need for matching code in addrconf_leave_anycast() as it
|   will silently ignore any attempt to leave an unknown anycast
|   address.

After analysis, because 1) we may add two or more prefixes on the
same interface, or 2)user may have manually joined that anycast,
we may hit chances to have anycast address which as if we had
generated one by /127 prefix and we should not leave from subnet-
router anycast address unconditionally.
