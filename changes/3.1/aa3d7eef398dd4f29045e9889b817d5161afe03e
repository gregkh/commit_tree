wireless: Reset beacon_found while updating regulatory

During the association, the regulatory is updated by country IE
that reaps the previously found beacons. The impact is that
after a STA disconnects *or* when for any reason a regulatory
domain change happens the beacon hint flag is not cleared
therefore preventing future beacon hints to be learned.
This is important as a regulatory domain change or a restore
of regulatory settings would set back the passive scan and no-ibss
flags on the channel. This is the right place to do this given that
it covers any regulatory domain change.
