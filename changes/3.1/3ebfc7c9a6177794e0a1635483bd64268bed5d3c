e1000e: Clear host wakeup bit on 82577/8 without touching PHY page 800

The Host Wakeup Active bit in the PHY Port General Configuration register
(page 769 register 17) must be cleared after every PHY reset to prevent an
unexpected wake signal from the PHY. Originally, this was accomplished by
simply reading the PHY Wakeup Control register on page 800 which clears the
Host Wakeup Active bit as a side-effect. Unfortunately, a hardware bug on
the 82577 and 82578 PHY can cause unexpected behavior when registers on
page 800 are accessed while in gigabit mode.

This patch changes the remaining instances when the Host Wakeup Active bit
needs to be cleared while possibly in gigabit mode by accessing the Port
General Configuration register directly instead of accessing any register
on page 800.
