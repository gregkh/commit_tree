fs/9p: When doing inode lookup compare qid details and inode mode bits.

This make sure we don't use wrong inode from the inode hash. The inode number
of the file deleted is reused by the next file system object created

with wrong struct inode.

Also compare inode generation number. Not all Linux file system provide
st_gen in userspace. So it could be 0;
