xfs: remove i_transp

Remove the transaction pointer in the inode.  It's only used to avoid
passing down an argument in the bmap code, and for a few asserts in
the transaction code right now.

Also use the local variable ip in a few more places in xfs_inode_item_unlock,
so that it isn't only used for debug builds after the above change.
