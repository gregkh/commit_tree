ACPICA: Do not repair _TSS return package if _PSS is present

We can only sort the _TSS return package if there is no _PSS
in the same scope. This is because if _PSS is present, the ACPI
specification dictates that the _TSS Power Dissipation field is
to be ignored, and therefore some BIOSs leave garbage values in
the _TSS Power field(s).  In this case, it is best to just return
the _TSS package as-is.
