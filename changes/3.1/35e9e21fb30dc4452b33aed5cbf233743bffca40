USB: option driver: add PID for Vodafone-Huawei K4511

This patch adds the product ID of Huawei's Vodafone K4511 mobile broadband
modem to option.c. This is necessary so that the driver gets loaded on demand
without the intervention of usb_modeswitch. This has the benefit of it becoming
available faster and also ensures that the option driver is not bound to a
network interface that should be claimed by cdc_ether.
