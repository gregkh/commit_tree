savagedb: Fix typo causing regression in savage4 series video chip detection

Two additional savage4 variants were added, but the S3_SAVAGE4_SERIES
macro was incompletely modified, resulting in a false positive detection
of a savage4 card regardless of which savage card is actually present.

For non-savage4 series cards, such as a Savage/IX-MV card, this results
in garbled video and/or a hard-hang at boot time.  Fix this by changing
an '||' to an '&&' in the S3_SAVAGE4_SERIES macro.
