pata_via: disable ATAPI DMA on AVERATEC 3200

On AVERATEC 3200, pata_via causes memory corruption with ATAPI DMA,
which often leads to random kernel oops.  The cause of the problem is
not well understood yet and only small subset of machines using the
controller seem affected.  Blacklist ATAPI DMA on the machine.
