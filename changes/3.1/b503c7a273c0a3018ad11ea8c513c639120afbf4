ath9k_hw: Fix STA (AR9485) bringup issue due to incorrect MAC address

Due to some recent optimization done in the way the mac address
bytes are written into the OTP memory, some AR9485 chipsets were
forced to use the first byte from the eeprom template and the
remaining bytes are read from OTP.

AR9485 happens to use generic eeprom template which has 0x1 as
the first byte causes issues in bringing up the card.

So fixed the eeprom template accordingly to address the issue.
