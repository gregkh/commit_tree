sched: Skip autogroup when looking for all rt sched groups

Since commit ec514c48 ("sched: Fix rt_rq runtime leakage bug")
'cat /proc/sched_debug' will print data of root_task_group.rt_rq
multiple times.

This is because autogroup does not have its own rt group, instead
rt group of autogroup is linked to root_task_group.

So skip it when we are looking for all rt sched groups, and it
will also save some noop operation against root_task_group when
__disable_runtime()/__enable_runtime().

-v2: Based on Cheng Xu's idea which uses less code.
