KVM: MMU: introduce the rules to modify shadow page table

Introduce some interfaces to modify spte as linux kernel does:
- mmu_spte_clear_track_bits, it set the spte from present to nonpresent, and
  track the stat bits(accessed/dirty) of spte
- mmu_spte_clear_no_track, the same as mmu_spte_clear_track_bits except
  tracking the stat bits
- mmu_spte_set, set spte from nonpresent to present
- mmu_spte_update, only update the stat bits

Now, it does not allowed to set spte from present to present, later, we can
drop the atomicly opration for X86_32 host, and it is the preparing work to
get spte on X86_32 host out of the mmu lock
