perf, arch: Add generic NODE cache events

Add a NODE level to the generic cache events which is used to measure
local vs remote memory accesses. Like all other cache events, an
ACCESS is HIT+MISS, if there is no way to distinguish between reads
and writes do reads only etc..

The below needs filling out for !x86 (which I filled out with
unsupported events).

I'm fairly sure ARM can leave it like that since it doesn't strike me as
an architecture that even has NUMA support. SH might have something since
it does appear to have some NUMA bits.

Sparc64, PowerPC and MIPS certainly want a good look there since they
clearly are NUMA capable.
