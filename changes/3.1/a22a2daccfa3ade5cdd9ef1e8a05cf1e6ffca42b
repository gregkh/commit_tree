KVM: PPC: Resolve real-mode handlers through function exports

Up until now, Book3S KVM had variables stored in the kernel that a kernel module
or the kvm code in the kernel could read from to figure out where some real mode
helper functions are located.

This is all unnecessary. The high bits of the EA get ignore in real mode, so we
can just use the pointer as is. Also, it's a lot easier on relocations when we
use the normal way of resolving the address to a function, instead of jumping
through hoops.

This patch fixes compilation with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.
