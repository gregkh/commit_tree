XZ: Fix missing <linux/kernel.h> include

<linux/kernel.h> is needed for min_t. The old version
happened to work on x86 because <asm/unaligned.h>
indirectly includes <linux/kernel.h>, but it didn't
work on ARM.

<linux/kernel.h> includes <asm/byteorder.h> so it's
not necessary to include it explicitly anymore.
