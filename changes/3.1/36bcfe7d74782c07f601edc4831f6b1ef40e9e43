stmmac: unify MAC and PHY configuration parameters (V2)

Prior to this change, most PHY configuration parameters were passed
into the STMMAC device as a separate PHY device. As well as being
unusual, this made it difficult to make changes to the MAC/PHY
relationship.

This patch moves all the PHY parameters into the MAC configuration
structure, mainly as a separate structure. This allows us to completely
ignore the MDIO bus attached to a stmmac if desired, and not create
the PHY bus. It also allows the stmmac driver to use a different PHY
from the one it is connected to, for example a fixed PHY or bit banging
PHY.

Also derive the stmmac/PHY connection type (MII/RMII etc) from the
mode can be passed into <platf>_configure_ethernet.
STLinux kernel at git://git.stlinux.com/stm/linux-sh4-2.6.32.y.git
provides several examples how to use this new infrastructure (that
actually is easier to maintain and clearer).
