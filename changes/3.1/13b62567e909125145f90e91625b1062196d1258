perf tools: Add automated tests for events parsing

Adding builtin test for parse_events function, which is
responsible for parsing/processing "-e" option for
stat/top/record commands.

This new test will run within the builtin test command suite
(perf test).

One or several tests were added for each type of event.
More tests could be added easily if needed.
