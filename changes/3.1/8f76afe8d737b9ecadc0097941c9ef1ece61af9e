[media] xc4000: removed redundant tuner reset

This patch causes the tuner reset command to be ignored in the firmware
code, since this only happens when the BASE/INIT1 firmware is loaded by
check_firmware(), and in that case check_firmware() already calls the
reset callback before starting to load the firmware.
