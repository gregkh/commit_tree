batman-adv: keep local table consistency for further TT_RESPONSE

To keep transtable consistency among all the nodes, an originator must
not send not yet announced clients within a full table TT_RESPONSE.
Instead, deleted client have to be kept in the table in order to be sent
within an immediate TT_RESPONSE. In this way all the nodes in the
network will always provide the same response for the same request.

All the modification are committed at the next ttvn increment event.
