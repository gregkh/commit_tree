KVM: nVMX: Add VMCS fields to the vmcs12

In this patch we add to vmcs12 (the VMCS that L1 keeps for L2) all the
standard VMCS fields.

Later patches will enable L1 to read and write these fields using VMREAD/
VMWRITE, and they will be used during a VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME in preparing vmcs02,
a hardware VMCS for running L2.
