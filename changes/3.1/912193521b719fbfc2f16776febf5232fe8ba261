exec: do not call request_module() twice from search_binary_handler()

Currently, search_binary_handler() tries to load binary loader module
using request_module() if a loader for the requested program is not yet
loaded.  But second attempt of request_module() does not affect the result
of search_binary_handler().

If request_module() triggered recursion, calling request_module() twice
causes 2 to the power of MAX_KMOD_CONCURRENT (= 50) repetitions.  It is
not an infinite loop but is sufficient for users to consider as a hang up.

Therefore, this patch changes not to call request_module() twice, making 1
to the power of MAX_KMOD_CONCURRENT repetitions in case of recursion.
