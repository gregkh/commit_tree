md/raid5: unify stripe_head_state and r6_state

'struct stripe_head_state' stores state about the 'current' stripe
that is passed around while handling the stripe.
For RAID6 there is an extension structure: r6_state, which is also
passed around.
There is no value in keeping these separate, so move the fields from
the latter into the former.

This means that all code now needs to treat s->failed_num as an small
array, but this is a small cost.
