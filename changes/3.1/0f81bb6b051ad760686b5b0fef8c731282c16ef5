ARM: 7066/1: proc-v7: disable SCTLR.TE when disabling MMU

cpu_v7_reset disables the MMU and then branches to the provided address.
On Thumb-2 kernels, we should take care to clear the Thumb Exception
enable bit in the System Control Register, otherwise this may wreak
havok in the code to which we are branching (for example, an ARM kernel
image via kexec).
