mmc: omap_hsmmc: Remove lazy_disable

lazy_disable framework in OMAP HSMMC manages multiple low power states and
card is powered off after inactivity time of 8 seconds.  Based on previous
discussion on the list, card power (regulator) handling (when to power
OFF/ON) should ideally be handled by core layer.  Remove usage of lazy
disable to allow core layer _only_ to handle card power.  With the removal
of lazy disable framework, MMC regulators are left ON until MMC_POWER_OFF
via set_ios.
