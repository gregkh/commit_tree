Squashfs: Make ZLIB compression support optional

Squashfs now supports XZ and LZO compression in addition to ZLIB.
As such it no longer makes sense to always include ZLIB support.
In particular embedded systems may only use LZO or XZ compression, and
the ability to exclude ZLIB support will reduce kernel size.
