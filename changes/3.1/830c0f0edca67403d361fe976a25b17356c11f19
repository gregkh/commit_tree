vfs: renumber DCACHE_xyz flags, remove some stale ones

Gcc tends to generate better code with small integers, including the
DCACHE_xyz flag tests - so move the common ones to be first in the list.
Also just remove the unused DCACHE_INOTIFY_PARENT_WATCHED and
DCACHE_AUTOFS_PENDING values, their users no longer exists in the source
tree.

And add a "unlikely()" to the DCACHE_OP_COMPARE test, since we want the
common case to be a nice straight-line fall-through.
