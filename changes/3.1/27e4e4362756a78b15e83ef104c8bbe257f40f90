CRED: Restore const to current_cred()

Commit 3295514841c2 ("fix rcu annotations noise in cred.h") accidentally
dropped the const of current->cred inside current_cred() by the
insertion of a cast to deal with an RCU annotation loss warning from
sparce.

Use an appropriate RCU wrapper instead so as not to lose the const.
