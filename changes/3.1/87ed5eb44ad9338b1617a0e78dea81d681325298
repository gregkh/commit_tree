NFS: Don't use DATA_SYNC writes

If we're writing back data, and the FLUSH_STABLE flag is set, then we
always want to use NFS_FILE_SYNC, since we're always in a situation where
we're doing page reclaim, and so we want to free up the page as quickly
as possible.

If we're in the FLUSH_COND_STABLE case, then we either want to use another
unstable write (if we have to do a commit anyway) or again, we want to
use NFS_FILE_SYNC because we know that we have no more pages to write
out.
