blktrace: add FLUSH/FUA support

Add FLUSH/FUA support to blktrace. As FLUSH precedes WRITE and/or
FUA follows WRITE, use the same 'F' flag for both cases and
distinguish them by their (relative) position. The end results
look like (other flags might be shown also):

 - WRITE:            W
 - WRITE_FLUSH:      FW
 - WRITE_FUA:        WF
 - WRITE_FLUSH_FUA:  FWF

Note that we reuse TC_BARRIER due to lack of bit space of act_mask
so that the older versions of blktrace tools will report flush
requests as barriers from now on.
