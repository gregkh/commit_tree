tracing: Still trace filtered irq functions when irq trace is disabled

If a function is set to be traced by the set_graph_function, but the
option funcgraph-irqs is zero, and the traced function happens to be
called from a interrupt, it will not be traced.

The point of funcgraph-irqs is to not trace interrupts when we are
preempted by an irq, not to not trace functions we want to trace that
happen to be *in* a irq.

Luckily the current->trace_recursion element is perfect to add a flag
to help us be able to trace functions within an interrupt even when
we are not tracing interrupts that preempt the trace.
