ALSA: hda: Virtualize SPDIF out controls

The SPDIF output controls apply to converter widgets. A future change
will create a PCM device per pin widget, and hence a set of SPDIF output
controls per pin widget, for certain HDMI codecs. To support this, we
need the ability to virtualize the SPDIF output controls. Specifically:

* Controls can be "unassigned" from real hardware when a converter is
  not used for the PCM the control was created for.
* Control puts only write to hardware when they are assigned.
* Controls can be "assigned" to real hardware when a converter is picked
  to support output for a particular PCM.
* When a converter is assigned, the hardware is updated to the cached
  configuration.
