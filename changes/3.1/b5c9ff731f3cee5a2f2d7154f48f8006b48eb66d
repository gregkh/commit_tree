KVM: x86 emulator: Avoid clearing the whole decode_cache

During tracing the emulator, we noticed that init_emulate_ctxt()
sometimes took a bit longer time than we expected.

This patch is for mitigating the problem by some degree.

By looking into the function, we soon notice that it clears the whole
decode_cache whose size is about 2.5K bytes now.  Furthermore, most of
the bytes are taken for the two read_cache arrays, which are used only
by a few instructions.

Considering the fact that we are not assuming the cache arrays have
been cleared when we store actual data, we do not need to clear the
arrays: 2K bytes elimination.  In addition, we can avoid clearing the
fetch_cache and regs arrays.

This patch changes the initialization not to clear the arrays.

On our 64-bit host, init_emulate_ctxt() becomes 0.3 to 0.5us faster with
this patch applied.
