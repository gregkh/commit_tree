mlx4: use pci_dev->revision

Commit 725c89997e03d71b09ea3c17c997da0712b9d835 (mlx4_en: Reporting HW revision
in ethtool -i) added code to read the revision ID from the PCI configuration
register while it's already stored by PCI subsystem in the 'revision' field of
'struct pci_dev'...

While at it, move the code being changed a bit in order to not break the
initialization sequence.
