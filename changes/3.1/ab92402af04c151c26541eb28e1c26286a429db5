thermal: hide CONFIG_THERMAL_HWMON

It's about time to revert 16d752397301b9 ("thermal: Create
CONFIG_THERMAL_HWMON=n").  Anybody running a kernel >= 2.6.40 would also
be running a recent enough version of lm-sensors.

Actually having CONFIG_THERMAL_HWMON is pretty convenient so instead of
dropping it, we keep it but hide it.
