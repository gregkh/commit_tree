xen: x86_32: do not enable iterrupts when returning from exception in interrupt context

If vmalloc page_fault happens inside of interrupt handler with interrupts
disabled then on exit path from exception handler when there is no pending
interrupts, the following code (arch/x86/xen/xen-asm_32.S:112):

	cmpw $0x0001, XEN_vcpu_info_pending(%eax)
	sete XEN_vcpu_info_mask(%eax)

will enable interrupts even if they has been previously disabled according to
eflags from the bounce frame (arch/x86/xen/xen-asm_32.S:99)

	testb $X86_EFLAGS_IF>>8, 8+1+ESP_OFFSET(%esp)
	setz XEN_vcpu_info_mask(%eax)

Solution is in setting XEN_vcpu_info_mask only when it should be set
according to
	cmpw $0x0001, XEN_vcpu_info_pending(%eax)
but not clearing it if there isn't any pending events.

Reproducer for bug is attached to RHBZ 707552
