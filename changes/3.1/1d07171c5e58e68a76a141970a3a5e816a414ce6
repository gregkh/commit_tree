slub: disable interrupts in cmpxchg_double_slab when falling back to pagelock

Split cmpxchg_double_slab into two functions. One for the case where we know that
interrupts are disabled (and therefore the fallback does not need to disable
interrupts) and one for the other cases where fallback will also disable interrupts.

This fixes the issue that __slab_free called cmpxchg_double_slab in some scenarios
without disabling interrupts.
