vfs: remove LOOKUP_NO_AUTOMOUNT flag

That flag no longer makes sense, since we don't look up automount points
as eagerly any more.  Additionally, it turns out that the NO_AUTOMOUNT
handling was buggy to begin with: it would avoid automounting even for
cases where we really *needed* to do the automount handling, and could
return ENOENT for autofs entries that hadn't been instantiated yet.

With our new non-eager automount semantics, one discussion has been
about adding a AT_AUTOMOUNT flag to vfs_fstatat (and thus the
newfstatat() and fstatat64() system calls), but it's probably not worth
it: you can always force at least directory automounting by simply
adding the final '/' to the filename, which works for *all* of the stat
family system calls, old and new.

So AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT (and thus LOOKUP_NO_AUTOMOUNT) really were just a
result of our bad default behavior.
