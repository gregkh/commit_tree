coredump: escape / in hostname and comm

Change every occurence of / in comm and hostname to !.  If the process
changes its name to contain /, the core is not dumped (if the directory
tree doesn't exist like that).  The same with hostname being something
like myhost/3.  Fix this behaviour by using the escape loop used in %E.
(We extract it to a separate function.)

Now both with comm == myprocess/1 and hostname == myhost/1, the core is
dumped like (kernel.core_pattern='core.%p.%e.%h):
core.2349.myprocess!1.myhost!1
