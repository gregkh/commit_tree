fs: always maintain i_dio_count

Maintain i_dio_count for all filesystems, not just those using DIO_LOCKING.
This these filesystems to also protect truncate against direct I/O requests
by using common code.  Right now the only non-DIO_LOCKING filesystem that
appears to do so is XFS, which uses an opencoded variant of the i_dio_count
scheme.

Behaviour doesn't change for filesystems never calling inode_dio_wait.
For ext4 behaviour changes when using the dioread_nonlock option, which
previously was missing any protection between truncate and direct I/O reads.
For ocfs2 that handcrafted i_dio_count manipulations are replaced with
the common code now enable.
