ext4: prevent parallel resizers by atomic bit ops

Before this patch, parallel resizers are allowed and protected by a
mutex lock, actually, there is no need to support parallel resizer, so
this patch prevents parallel resizers by atmoic bit ops, like
lock_page() and unlock_page() do.

To do this, the patch removed the mutex lock s_resize_lock from struct
ext4_sb_info and added a unsigned long field named s_resize_flags
which inidicates if there is a resizer.
