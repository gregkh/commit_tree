Btrfs: implement our own ->llseek

In order to handle SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA we need to implement our own llseek.
Basically for the normal SEEK_*'s we will just defer to the generic helper, and
for SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA we will use our fiemap helper to figure out the nearest
hole or data.  Currently this helper doesn't check for delalloc bytes for
prealloc space, so for now treat prealloc as data until that is fixed.  Thanks,
