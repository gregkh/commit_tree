md/raid5: Remove stripe_head_state arg from handle_stripe_expansion.

This arg is only used to differentiate between RAID5 and RAID6 but
that is not needed.  For RAID5, raid5_compute_sector will set qd_idx
to "~0" so j with certainly not equals qd_idx, so there is no need
for a guard on that condition.

So remove the guard and remove the arg from the declaration and
callers of handle_stripe_expansion.
