ide-disk: Fix request requeuing

Simon Kirby reported that on his RAID setup with idedisk underneath
the box OOMs after a couple of days of runtime. Running with
CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK pointed to idedisk_prep_fn() which unconditionally
allocates an ide_cmd struct. However, ide_requeue_and_plug() can be
called more than once per request, either from the request issue or the
IRQ handler path and do blk_peek_request() ends up in idedisk_prep_fn()
repeatedly, allocating a struct ide_cmd everytime and "forgetting" the
previous pointer.

Make sure the code reuses the old allocated chunk.
