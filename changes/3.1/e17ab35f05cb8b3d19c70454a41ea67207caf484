xen/pciback: Don't setup an fake IRQ handler for SR-IOV devices.

If we try to setup an fake IRQ handler for legacy interrupts
for devices that only have MSI-X (most if not all SR-IOV cards),
we will fail with this:

pciback[0000:01:10.0]: failed to install fake IRQ handler for IRQ 0! (rc:-38)

Since those cards don't have anything in dev->irq.
