ceph: fix bad parent_inode calc in ceph_lookup_open

We were always getting NULL here because the intent file f_dentry is always
NULL at this point, which means we were always passing NULL to
ceph_mdsc_do_request.  In reality, this was fine, since this isn't
currently ever a write operation that needs to get strung on the dir's
unsafe list.

Use the dir explicitly, and only pass it if this open has side-effects that
a dir fsync should flush.
