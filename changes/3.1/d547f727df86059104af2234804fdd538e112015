ipv4: fix the reusing of routing cache entries

	compare_keys and ip_route_input_common rely on
rt_oif for distinguishing of input and output routes
with same keys values. But sometimes the input route has
also same hash chain (keyed by iif != 0) with the output
routes (keyed by orig_oif=0). Problem visible if running
with small number of rhash_entries.

	Fix them to use rt_route_iif instead. By this way
input route can not be returned to users that request
output route.

	The patch fixes the ip_rt_bug errors that were
reported in ip_local_out context, mostly for 255.255.255.255
destinations.
