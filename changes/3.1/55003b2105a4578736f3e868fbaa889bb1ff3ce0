ACPI / Battery: Change 16-bit signed negative battery current into correct value

This patch is for some machines which report the battery current
as a 16-bit signed negative when it is charging. This is caused
by DSDT bug. The commit bc76f90b8a5cf4aceedf210d08d5e8292f820cec
has resolved the problem for Acer laptops. But some other machines
also have such problem.

Since it is improper that the current is above 32A on laptops
whether on AC or on battery, this patch is to check the current and
 take its absolute value as current and producing a message when it
is negative in s16.

Remove Acer quirk, as this workaround handles Acer too.
