MD bitmap: Revert DM dirty log hooks


Revert most of commit e384e58549a2e9a83071ad80280c1a9053cfd84c
  md/bitmap: prepare for storing write-intent-bitmap via dm-dirty-log.

MD should not need to use DM's dirty log - we decided to use md's
bitmaps instead.

Keeping the DIV_ROUND_UP clean-ups that were part of commit
e384e58549a2e9a83071ad80280c1a9053cfd84c, however.
