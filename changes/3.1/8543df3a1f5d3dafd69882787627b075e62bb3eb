staging: brcm80211: remove dependency on pci core difinitions from aiutils.c

The file aiutils.c included the register definition includes for the
PCI and PCIe core. This was for two functions which have been partly
moved to nicpci.c. This means that nicpci.h is the only include file
to provide interface to aiutils.c for PCI core related functions.
