RDSRDMA: Fix cleanup of rds_iw_mr_pool

In the rds_iw_mr_pool struct the free_pinned field keeps track of
memory pinned by free MRs. While this field is incremented properly
upon allocation, it is never decremented upon unmapping. This would
cause the rds_rdma module to crash the kernel upon unloading, by
triggering the BUG_ON in the rds_iw_destroy_mr_pool function.

This change keeps track of the MRs that become unpinned, so that
free_pinned can be decremented appropriately.
