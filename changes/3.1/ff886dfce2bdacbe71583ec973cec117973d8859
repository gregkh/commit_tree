ixgbe: Pass staterr instead of re-reading status and error bits from descriptor

This change is meant to address possible race conditions from the status
and error bits on the RX descriptors being re-read by multiple functions in
the RX cleanup path.  To resolve this I have added code that will pass the
staterr value to those functions.
