Blackfin: dpmc: do not save/restore EVT0/EVT1/EVT4 when hibernating

EVT0 is for emulation, EVT1 is for reset, and EVT4 is the "global int
disable" region.  None of these are used by software (or even hardware),
so don't bother saving/restoring them when we hibernate since nothing
ever uses these in Linux (the only thing they would be useful for is
core-memory scratch, but that's just crazy talk).
