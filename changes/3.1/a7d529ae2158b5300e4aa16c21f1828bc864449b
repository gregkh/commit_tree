sfc: Allow resets to be upgraded; use atomic ops for safety

Currently an attempt to schedule any reset is ignored if a reset
is already pending.  This ignores the relative scopes - if the
requested reset is greater in scope then the scheduled reset should
be upgraded accordingly.

There are also some race conditions which could lead to a reset
request being lost.  Deal with them by using atomic operations on a
bitmask.  This also makes tests on reset_pending easier to get right.
