[media] vp7045: fix buffer setup

dvb_usb_device_init calls the frontend_attach method of this driver which
uses vp7045_usb_ob. In order to have a buffer ready in vp7045_usb_op, it has to
be allocated before that happens.

Luckily we can use the whole private data as the buffer as it gets separately
allocated on the heap via kzalloc in dvb_usb_device_init and is thus apt for
use via usb_control_msg.

This fixes a
	BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000000000001e78
