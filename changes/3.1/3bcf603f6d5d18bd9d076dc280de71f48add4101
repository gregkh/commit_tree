drm/i915: apply timing generator bug workaround on CPT and PPT

On CougarPoint and PantherPoint PCH chips, the timing generator may fail
to start after DP training completes.  This is due to a bug in the
FDI autotraining detect logic (which will stall the timing generator and
re-enable it once training completes), so disable it to avoid silent DP
mode setting failures.
