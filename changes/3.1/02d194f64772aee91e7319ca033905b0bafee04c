ARM: kprobes: Decode 16-bit Thumb data-processing instructions

These instructions only operate on the low registers R0-R7, therefore
it is possible to emulate them by executing the original instruction
unaltered if we restore and save these registers. This is what
t16_emulate_loregs does.

Some of these instructions don't update the PSR when they execute in an
IT block, so there are two flavours of emulation functions:
t16_emulate_loregs_{noit}rwflags
