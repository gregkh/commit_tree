zd1211rw: handle lost read-reg interrupts

Device losses read-reg interrupts. By looking at usbmon it appears that
USB_INT_ID_RETRY_FAILED can override USB_INT_ID_REGS. This causes read
command to timeout, usually under heavy TX.

Fix by retrying read registers again if USB_INT_ID_RETRY_FAILED is received
while waiting for USB_INT_ID_REGS.

However USB_INT_ID_REGS is not always lost but is received after
USB_INT_ID_RETRY_FAILED and is usually received by the retried read
command. USB_INT_ID_REGS of the retry is then left unhandled and might
be received by next read command. Handle this by ignoring previous
USB_INT_ID_REGS that doesn't match current read command request.
