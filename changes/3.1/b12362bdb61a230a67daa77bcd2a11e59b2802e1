vfs: conditionally call inode_wb_list_del()

Some inodes (pipes, sockets, ...) are not in bdi writeback list.

evict() can avoid calling inode_wb_list_del() and its expensive spinlock
by checking inode i_wb_list being empty or not.

At this point, no other cpu/user can concurrently manipulate this inode
i_wb_list
