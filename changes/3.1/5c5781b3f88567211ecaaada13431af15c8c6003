Staging: hv: netvsc: Increase the timeout value in the netvsc driver

On some loaded windows hosts, we have discovered that the host may not
respond to guest requests within the specified time (one second)
as evidenced by the guest timing out. Fix this problem by increasing
the timeout to 5 seconds.

It may be useful to apply this patch to the 3.0 kernel as well.
