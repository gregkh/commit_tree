x86-64: Rework vsyscall emulation and add vsyscall= parameter

There are three choices:

vsyscall=native: Vsyscalls are native code that issues the
corresponding syscalls.

vsyscall=emulate (default): Vsyscalls are emulated by instruction
fault traps, tested in the bad_area path.  The actual contents of
the vsyscall page is the same as the vsyscall=native case except
that it's marked NX.  This way programs that make assumptions about
what the code in the page does will not be confused when they read
that code.

vsyscall=none: Trying to execute a vsyscall will segfault.
