ASoC: Fix DAPM sequence run for per-widget I/O methods

Previously we were using the DAPM context rather than a widget as the
argument for update_bits() so we didn't need to care that our list walk
of widgets left us one beyond the end of the list. Now we're using them
for the register update we need to make sure we're pointing at an actual
widget not the list_head.

Fix originally suggested by Liam on IM.
