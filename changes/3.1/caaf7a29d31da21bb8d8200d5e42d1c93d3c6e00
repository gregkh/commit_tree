ext4: Fix a double free of sbi->s_group_info in ext4_mb_init_backend

If we meet with an error in ext4_mb_add_groupinfo, we kfree
sbi->s_group_info[group >> EXT4_DESC_PER_BLOCK_BITS(sb)], but fail to
reset it to NULL. So the caller ext4_mb_init_backend will try to kfree
it again and causes a double free. So fix it by resetting it to NULL.

Some typo in comments of mballoc.c are also changed.
