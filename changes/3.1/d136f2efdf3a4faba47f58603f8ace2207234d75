dm kcopyd: fix job_pool leak

Fix memory leak introduced by commit a6e50b409d3f9e0833e69c3c9cca822e8fa4adbb
(dm snapshot: skip reading origin when overwriting complete chunk).

When allocating a set of jobs from kc->job_pool, job->master_job must be
set (to point to itself) so that the mempool item gets freed when the
master_job completes.

master_job was introduced by commit c6ea41fbbe08f270a8edef99dc369faf809d1bd6
(dm kcopyd: preallocate sub jobs to avoid deadlock)
