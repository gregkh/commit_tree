ath5k: disable 32KHz sleep clock operation by default

While 32 KHz sleep clock might provide some power saving benefits,
it is also a major source of stability issues, on OpenWrt it produced
some reproducible data bus errors on register accesses on several
different MIPS platforms.

All the Atheros drivers that I can find do not enable this feature,
so it makes sense to leave it disabled in ath5k as well.
