x86, mce, severity: Fix two severities table signatures

The "Spurious not enabled" entry is redundant: the "Not enabled" entry
earlier in the table will cover this case.

The "Action required; unknown MCACOD" entry shouldn't specify MCACOD in
the .mask field. Current code will only match for mcacod==0 rather than
all AR=1 entries.
