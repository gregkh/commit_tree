spi/imx: merge type SPI_IMX_VER_0_7 into SPI_IMX_VER_0_4

The only difference between SPI_IMX_VER_0_7 and SPI_IMX_VER_0_4 is
.config function.  The patch uses cpu_is_mx35 (to be removed) as the
temporary solution to consolidate functions spi_imx0_4_config and
spi_imx0_7_config into mx31_config.  As a result, type SPI_IMX_VER_0_7
can be merged into SPI_IMX_VER_0_4.

It also renames function spi_imx0_4_reset to mx31_reset to keep
consistency with other function naming.

A couple of redundant macros, MX3_CSPISTAT and MX3_CSPISTAT_RR,
together with the useless type SPI_IMX_VER_0_5 also get cleaned up.
