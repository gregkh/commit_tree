ARM: convert PCI defines to variables

Convert PCIBIOS_MIN_IO and PCIBIOS_MIN_MEM to variables to allow
multi-platform builds. This also removes the requirement for a platform to
have a mach/hardware.h.

The default values for i/o and mem are 0x1000 and 0x01000000, respectively.
Per Arnd Bergmann, other values are likely to be incorrect, but this commit
does not try to address that issue.
