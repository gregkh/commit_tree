arch/powerpc/sysdev/fsl_rio.c: correct IECSR register clear value

This bug causes the IECSR register clear failure.  In this case, the RETE
(retry error threshold exceeded) interrupt will be generated and cannot be
cleared.  So the related ISR may be called persistently.

The RETE bit in IECSR is cleared by writing a 1 to it.
