Btrfs: fix enospc problems with delalloc

So I had this brilliant idea to use atomic counters for outstanding and reserved
extents, but this turned out to be a bad idea.  Consider this where we have 1
outstanding extent and 1 reserved extent

Reserver				Releaser
					atomic_dec(outstanding) now 0
atomic_read(outstanding)+1 get 1
atomic_read(reserved) get 1
don't actually reserve anything because
they are the same
					atomic_cmpxchg(reserved, 1, 0)
atomic_inc(outstanding)
atomic_add(0, reserved)
					free reserved space for 1 extent

Then the reserver now has no actual space reserved for it, and when it goes to
finish the ordered IO it won't have enough space to do it's allocation and you
get those lovely warnings.
