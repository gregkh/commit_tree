ARM: kprobes: Decode 32-bit Thumb load/store dual and load/store exclusive instructions

We reject probing of load/store exclusive instructions because any
emulation routine could never succeed in gaining exclusive access as the
exception framework clears the exclusivity monitor when a probes
breakpoint is hit.
