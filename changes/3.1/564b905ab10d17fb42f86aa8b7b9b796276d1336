PM / Domains: Rename struct dev_power_domain to struct dev_pm_domain

The naming convention used by commit 7538e3db6e015e890825fbd9f86599b
(PM: Add support for device power domains), which introduced the
struct dev_power_domain type for representing device power domains,
evidently confuses some developers who tend to think that objects
of this type must correspond to "power domains" as defined by
hardware, which is not the case.  Namely, at the kernel level, a
struct dev_power_domain object can represent arbitrary set of devices
that are mutually dependent power management-wise and need not belong
to one hardware power domain.  To avoid that confusion, rename struct
dev_power_domain to struct dev_pm_domain and rename the related
pointers in struct device and struct pm_clk_notifier_block from
pwr_domain to pm_domain.
