x86, UV: Remove cpumask_t from the stack

Remove the large stack-resident cpumask_t from
reset_with_ipi()'s stack by allocating one per uvhub.

Due to the limited size of the stack the potentially huge cpumask_t may
cause stack overrun.  We haven't seen it happen yet, but we need to make it
a practice not to push such structures onto the stack.
