[media] drxk: fix warning: ‘status’ may be used uninitialized in this function

One of the problems of the old CHECK_ERROR is that it was hiding
the status parameter. Maybe due to that, on a few places, the return
code might lead to return incorrect status:

drivers/media/dvb/frontends/drxk_hard.c: In function ‘load_microcode.clone.0’:
drivers/media/dvb/frontends/drxk_hard.c:1281: warning: ‘status’ may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/media/dvb/frontends/drxk_hard.c:1281: note: ‘status’ was declared here
drivers/media/dvb/frontends/drxk_hard.c: In function ‘GetLockStatus’:
drivers/media/dvb/frontends/drxk_hard.c:1792: warning: ‘status’ may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/media/dvb/frontends/drxk_hard.c: In function ‘Start.clone.7’:
drivers/media/dvb/frontends/drxk_hard.c:1734: warning: ‘status’ may be used uninitialized in this function
