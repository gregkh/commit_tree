ARM: pm: omap34xx: remove get_*_restore_pointer functions, directly use entry points

Upon return from off-mode, the ROM code jumps to a restore function
saved in the scratchpad.  Based on SoC revision or errata, this
restore entry point is different.  Current code uses some helper
functions in sleep34xx.S (get_*_restore_pointer) to get the restore
function entry point.

When returning from off-mode, this code is executed from SDRAM, so
there's no reason to use these helper functions when using the SDRAM
entry points directly would work just fine.

This patch uses ENTRY/ENDPROC to create "real" entry points for these
functions, and uses those values directly when writing the scratchpad.

Tested all three entry points
- restore_es3: 3430/n900
- restore_3630: 3630/Zoom3
- restore: 3530/Overo
