b43: HT-PHY: upload PHY values when switching channel

After calibrating radio you can find few PHY writes in MMIO dumps:
 phy_read(0x0009) -> 0x0000
phy_write(0x01ce) <- 0x03dd
phy_write(0x01cf) <- 0x03d9
phy_write(0x01d0) <- 0x03d5
phy_write(0x01d1) <- 0x0424
phy_write(0x01d2) <- 0x0429
phy_write(0x01d3) <- 0x042d
By comparing to N-PHY code we found out that they are PHY tables for
channel switching plus band info read at the beginning.
