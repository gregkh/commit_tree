kernel: prevent unnecessary rebuilding due to config_data.gz

When IKCONFIG is built-in make oldconfig will cause the kernel to be
relinked even if .config didn't change. This happens because of a
config_data.gz dependency on .config. This patch changes the if_changed
to a filechk so that config_data.h is only rebuilt when the contents
have actually changed.
