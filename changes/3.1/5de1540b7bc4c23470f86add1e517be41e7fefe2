drivers/amba: create devices from device tree

Add a function to create amba_devices (i.e. primecell peripherals)
from device tree nodes. The device tree scanning is done by the
of_platform_populate() function which can call of_amba_device_create
based on a match table entry.

Nodes with a "arm,primecell-periphid" property can override the h/w
peripheral id value.

Based on the original work by Jeremy Kerr.
