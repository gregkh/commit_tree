ARM: 6977/1: pmu: add platform_device_id table support

This patch adds support for platform_device_id tables, allowing new
PMU types to be registered with the correct type, without requiring
new platform_driver shims to provide the type. An single entry for
existing devices is provided.

Macros matching functionality of the of_device_id table macros are
provided for convenience.
