MIPS: static should be at beginning of declaration

Make sure that the 'static' keywork is at the beginning of declaration
for arch/mips/include/asm/mach-jz4740/gpio.h

This gets rid of warnings like
  warning: ‘static’ is not at beginning of declaration
when building with -Wold-style-declaration (and/or -Wextra which also
enables it).
Also a few tiny whitespace changes.
