smc91c92_cs.c: fix bogus compiler warning

On a recent compile, I got this warning:

  CC [M]  drivers/net/pcmcia/smc91c92_cs.o
drivers/net/pcmcia/smc91c92_cs.c: In function ‘smc91c92_probe’:
drivers/net/pcmcia/smc91c92_cs.c:812:12: warning: ‘j’ may be used uninitialized in this function

However, "j" is only used in a branch which has the same condition as
a previous branch, where j is set, e.g.

	int j;

	if (CONDITION)
	    j = VALUE

	...

	if (CONDITION)
	   printk(j)

Still, avoid this warning, as it is easy to circumvent.
