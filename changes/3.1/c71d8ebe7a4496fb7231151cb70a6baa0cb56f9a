net: Fix security_socket_sendmsg() bypass problem.

The sendmmsg() introduced by commit 228e548e "net: Add sendmmsg socket system
call" is capable of sending to multiple different destination addresses.

SMACK is using destination's address for checking sendmsg() permission.
However, security_socket_sendmsg() is called for only once even if multiple
different destination addresses are passed to sendmmsg().

Therefore, we need to call security_socket_sendmsg() for each destination
address rather than only the first destination address.

Since calling security_socket_sendmsg() every time when only single destination
address was passed to sendmmsg() is a waste of time, omit calling
security_socket_sendmsg() unless destination address of previous datagram and
that of current datagram differs.
