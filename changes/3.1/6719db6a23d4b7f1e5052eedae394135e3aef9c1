Btrfs: fix 64 bit divide problem

This fixes a regression introduced by commit cdcb725c05fe ("Btrfs: check
if there is enough space for balancing smarter").  We can't do 64-bit
divides on 32-bit architectures.

In cases where we need to divide/multiply by 2 we should just left/right
shift respectively, and in cases where theres N number of devices use
do_div.  Also make the counters u64 to match up with rw_devices.
