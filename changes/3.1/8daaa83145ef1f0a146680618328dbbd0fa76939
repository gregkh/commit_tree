xfs: make use of new shrinker callout for the inode cache

Convert the inode reclaim shrinker to use the new per-sb shrinker
operations. This allows much bigger reclaim batches to be used, and
allows the XFS inode cache to be shrunk in proportion with the VFS
dentry and inode caches. This avoids the problem of the VFS caches
being shrunk significantly before the XFS inode cache is shrunk
resulting in imbalances in the caches during reclaim.
