parport/serial: add support for Timedia/SUNIX cards to parport_serial

Timedia/SUNIX PCI cards with both serial and parallel ports are
currently supported by 8250_pci and parport_pc individually.  Moving
that support into parport_serial allows using both types of ports at the
same time.

This was successfully tested with a SUNIX 4079T.
