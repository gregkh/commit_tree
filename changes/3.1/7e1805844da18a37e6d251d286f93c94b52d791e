USB option driver add PID of Huawei Vodafone K4605

This patch adds the product ID of Huawei's Vodafone K4605 mobile broadband
modem to option.c. This is necessary so that the driver gets loaded on
demand without the intervention of usb_modeswitch. This has the benefit of
it becoming available faster and also ensures that the option driver is not
bound to a network interface that should be claimed by suitable network
driver.
