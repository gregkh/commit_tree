perf sched: Do not delete session object prematurely

The session object is released prematurely when processing events for
latency command. The session's thread objects are used within the
output_lat_thread function.

Runnning following commands:

 # perf sched record
 # perf sched latency

the latter displays incorrect data and might cause access violation.
