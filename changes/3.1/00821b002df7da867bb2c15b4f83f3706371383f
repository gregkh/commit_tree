writeback: show bdi write bandwidth in debugfs

Add a "BdiWriteBandwidth" entry and indent others in /debug/bdi/*/stats.

btw, increase digital field width to 10, for keeping the possibly
huge BdiWritten number aligned at least for desktop systems.

Impact: this could break user space tools if they are dumb enough to
depend on the number of white spaces.
