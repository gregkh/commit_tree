x86, olpc-xo15-sci: Enable EC wakeup capability

Some recent changes to the way that ACPI handles wakeup flags
means that the XO15EC ACPI device is not wakeup-capable by
default so device_set_wakeup_enable() does nothing.

Use device_init_wakeup() to mark the device as wakeup capable,
and to enable wakeups.
