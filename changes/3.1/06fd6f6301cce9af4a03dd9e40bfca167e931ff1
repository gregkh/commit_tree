ftrace/recordmcount: Add warning logic to warn on mcount not recorded

There's some sections that should not have mcount recorded and should not have
modifications to the that code. But currently they waste some time by calling
mcount anyway (which simply returns). As the real answer should be to
either whitelist the section or have gcc ignore it fully.

This change adds a option to recordmcount to warn when it finds a section
that is ignored by ftrace but still contains mcount callers. This is not on
by default as developers may not know if the section should be completely
ignored or added to the whitelist.
