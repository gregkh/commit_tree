mfd: Read wm831x AUXADC conversion results before acknowledging interrupt

Ensure that there's no possibility of loosing an AUXADC interrupt by reading
the conversion result in the IRQ handler when using interrupts. Otherwise
it's possible that under very heavy load a new conversion could be initiated
before the acknowledgement for a previous interrupt has happened.
