ALSA: Use KBUILD_MODNAME for pci_driver.name entries

The convention for pci_driver.name entry in kernel drivers seem to be
the module name or equivalent ones.  But, so far, almost all PCI sound
drivers use more verbose name like "ABC Xyz (12)", and these are fairly
confusing when appearing as a file name.

This patch converts the all pci_driver.name entries in sound/pci/* to
use KBUILD_MODNAME for more unified appearance.
