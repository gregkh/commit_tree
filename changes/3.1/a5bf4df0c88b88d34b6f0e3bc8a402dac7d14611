md: use REQ_NOIDLE flag in md_super_write()

Queue idling is used for the anticipation of immediate
sequencial I/O's but md_super_write() is a kind of one-
shot operation, coupled with md_super_wait(), so the
idling in this case will be just a waste of time.

Specifying REQ_NOIDLE prevents it. Instead of adding
the flag to submit_bio() directly, use pre-defined
macro WRITE_FLUSH_FUA.
