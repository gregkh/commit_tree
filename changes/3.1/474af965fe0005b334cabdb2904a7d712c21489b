md/raid5: move some more common code into handle_stripe

The RAID6 version of this code is usable for RAID5 providing:
  - we test "conf->max_degraded" rather than "2" as appropriate
  - we make sure s->failed_num[1] is meaningful (and not '-1')
    when s->failed > 1

The 'return 1' must become 'goto finish' in the new location.
