vmscan: add customisable shrinker batch size

For shrinkers that have their own cond_resched* calls, having
shrink_slab break the work down into small batches is not
paticularly efficient. Add a custom batchsize field to the struct
shrinker so that shrinkers can use a larger batch size if they
desire.

A value of zero (uninitialised) means "use the default", so
behaviour is unchanged by this patch.
