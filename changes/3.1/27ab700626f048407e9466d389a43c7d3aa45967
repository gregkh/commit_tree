tmpfs: simplify filepage/swappage

We can now simplify shmem_getpage_gfp(): there is no longer a dilemma of
filepage passed in via shmem_readpage(), then swappage found, which must
then be copied over to it.

Although at first it's tempting to replace the **pagep arg by returning
struct page *, that makes a mess of IS_ERR_OR_NULL(page)s in all the
callers, so leave as is.

Insert BUG_ON(!PageUptodate) when we find and lock page: some of the
complication came from uninitialized pages inserted into filecache prior
to readpage; but now we're in control, and only release pagelock on
filecache once it's uptodate (if an error occurs in reading back from
swap, the page remains in swapcache, never moved to filecache).
