firewire: ohci: skip soft reset retries after card ejection

The software reset in firewire-ohci's pci_remove does not have a great
prospect of success if the card was already physically removed at this
point.  So let's skip the 500 ms that were spent in retries here.

Also, replace a defined constant by its open-coded value.  This is not a
constant from a specification but an arbitrarily chosen retry limit.  It
was only used in this single place.
