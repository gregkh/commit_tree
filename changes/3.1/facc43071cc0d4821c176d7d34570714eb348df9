perf: Optimize event scheduling locking

Currently we only hold one ctx->lock at a time, which results in us
flipping back and forth between cpuctx->ctx.lock and task_ctx->lock.

Avoid this and gain large atomic regions by holding both locks. We
nest the task lock inside the cpu lock, since with task scheduling we
might have to change task ctx while holding the cpu ctx lock.
