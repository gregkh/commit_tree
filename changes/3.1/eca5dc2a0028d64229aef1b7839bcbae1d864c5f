ARM: 6988/1: multi-cpu: remove arguments from CPU proc macros

The macros for invoking functions via the processor struct in the
MULTI_CPU case define the arguments as part of the macros, making it
impossible to take the address of those functions.

This patch removes the arguments from the macro definitions so that we
can take the address of these functions like we can for the !MULTI_CPU
case.
