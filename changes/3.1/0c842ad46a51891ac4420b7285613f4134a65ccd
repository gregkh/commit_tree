xfs: clean up buffer locking helpers

Rename xfs_buf_cond_lock and reverse it's return value to fit most other
trylock operations in the Kernel and XFS (with the exception of down_trylock,
after which xfs_buf_cond_lock was modelled), and replace xfs_buf_lock_val
with an xfs_buf_islocked for use in asserts, or and opencoded variant in
tracing.  remove the XFS_BUF_* wrappers for all the locking helpers.
