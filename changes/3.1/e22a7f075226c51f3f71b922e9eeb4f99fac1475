target: Implement Block Device Characteristics VPD page

Implement page B1h, Block Device Characteristics, so that we can report
a medium rotation rate of 1 (non-rotating / solid state) if the
is_nonrot device attribute is set; we update the iblock backend to set
this attribute if the underlying Linux block device has its nonrot
flag set.
