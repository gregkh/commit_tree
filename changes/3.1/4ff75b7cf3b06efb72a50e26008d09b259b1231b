net: correct comment on where to place transmit time stamp hook.

The comment for the skb_tx_timestamp() function suggests calling it just
after a buffer is released to the hardware for transmission. However,
for drivers that free the buffer in an ISR, this produces a race between
the time stamp code and the ISR. This commit changes the comment to advise
placing the call just before handing the buffer over to the hardware.
