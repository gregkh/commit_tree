sched: Separate group-scheduling code more clearly

Clean up cfs/rt runqueue initialization by moving group scheduling
related code into the corresponding functions.

Also, keep group scheduling as an add-on, so that things are only done
additionally, i. e. remove the init_*_rq() calls from init_tg_*_entry().
(This removes a redundant initalization during sched_init()).

In case of group scheduling rt_rq->highest_prio.curr is now initialized
twice, but adding another #ifdef seems not worth it.
