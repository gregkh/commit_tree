I noticed that you took some time back in late 2009 to 'consolidate' the
split format-strings present in the bonding driver at the time and I've
decided I'm fine to leave them the way they are.  The main point of my
patch was to change the output and I would like to get that included.
Here is my updated patch...

Subject: [PATCH net-next-2.6 v2] bonding: reduce noise during init

Many are using sysfs to configure bonding rather than module options, so
there is no need for bonding to throw this warning in normal cases.

Keep the message around when debugging is enabled as it might be useful
for someone desperate enough to enable debugging, but eliminate it
otherwise.
