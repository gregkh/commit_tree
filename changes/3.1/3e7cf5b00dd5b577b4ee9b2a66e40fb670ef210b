x86-32, fpu: Fix DNA exception during check_fpu()

Before check_fpu() is called, we have cr0.TS bit set and hence the floating
point code to check the FDIV bug was generating a DNA exception.

Use kernel_fpu_begin()/kernel_fpu_end() around the floating point
code to avoid this unnecessary device not available exception during
boot.
