enic: Pass 802.1p bits for packets tagged with vlan zero

enic driver currently passes 802.1p bits to the upper layers for packets
tagged with non-zero vlan ids only. This patch extends such behaviour to
zero vlan tagged packets also.

The patch is dependant on the following kernel patches:

1) vlan_dev: VLAN 0 should be treated as "no vlan tag" (802.1p packet)
   - net-next-2.6 git commit: ad1afb00393915a51c21b1ae8704562bf036855f
   - Available 2.6.36 and later
2) vlan: Centralize handling of hardware acceleration.
  - net-next-2.6 git commit: 3701e51382a026cba10c60b03efabe534fba4ca4
  - Available 2.6.37 and later
