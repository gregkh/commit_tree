dmaengine: add ep93xx DMA support

The ep93xx DMA controller has 10 independent memory to peripheral (M2P)
channels, and 2 dedicated memory to memory (M2M) channels. M2M channels can
also be used by SPI and IDE to perform DMA transfers to/from their memory
mapped FIFOs.

This driver supports both M2P and M2M channels with DMA_SLAVE, DMA_CYCLIC and
DMA_MEMCPY (M2M only) capabilities.
