udplite: fast-path computation of checksum coverage

Commit 903ab86d195cca295379699299c5fc10beba31c7 of 1 March this year ("udp: Add
lockless transmit path") introduced a new fast TX path that broke the checksum
coverage computation of UDP-lite, which so far depended on up->len (only set
if the socket is locked and 0 in the fast path).

Fixed by providing both fast- and slow-path computation of checksum coverage.
The latter can be removed when UDP(-lite)v6 also uses a lockless transmit path.
