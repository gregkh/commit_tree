asm-generic: move archictures to common delay.h

This patch moves the in-tree architectures that were using the 'generic'
delay.h over to using the header file in asm-generic.

This is not done using the generic-y mechanism as none of these arch's
have started using that mechanism yet.  This is a trivial change to make
later when the arch begins using generic-y.

Note the subtle change to the avr32 and SH architectures where the argument
to __const_udelay was previously using the rounded down constant value
instead of the rounded up value.
