slub: Invert locking and avoid slab lock

Locking slabs is no longer necesary if the arch supports cmpxchg operations
and if no debuggin features are used on a slab. If the arch does not support
cmpxchg then we fallback to use the slab lock to do a cmpxchg like operation.

The patch also changes the lock order. Slab locks are subsumed to the node lock
now. With that approach slab_trylocking is no longer necessary.
