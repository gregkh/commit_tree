md/raid1,10: Remove use-after-free bug in make_request.

A single request to RAID1 or RAID10 might result in multiple
requests if there are known bad blocks that need to be avoided.

To detect if we need to submit another write request we test:
 	if (sectors_handled < (bio->bi_size >> 9)) {

However this is after we call **_write_done() so the 'bio' no longer
belongs to us - the writes could have completed and the bio freed.

So move the **_write_done call until after the test against
bio->bi_size.

This addresses https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41862
