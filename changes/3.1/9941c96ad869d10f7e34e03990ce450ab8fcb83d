perf tools: Add support to install perf python extension

Adding install-python_ext target to install python extension related
files.  Installation directory is governed by python distutils package
and follows the DESTDIR variable settings.

Also moving python extension build output into '$(O)python_ext_build'
directory and making it configurable via PYTHON_EXTBUILD variable.

Keeping the '$(O)python/perf.so' file, so it could be used for testing
as of until now.
