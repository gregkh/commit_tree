ARM: tegra: paz00: change the machine name

This renames "paz00" in MACHINE_START macro to a neater string.
PAZ00 seems to have been the Compal internal project name, while
PROCYON looks like Toshiba project name.
Anyway, the AC100 support package in Ubuntu needs the new naming to
identify the machine.
