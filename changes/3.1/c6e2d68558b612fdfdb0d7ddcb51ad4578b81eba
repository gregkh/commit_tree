[CPUFREQ] S3C6410: Support 800MHz operation in cpufreq

At least some newer S3C6410 silicon supports operation up to 800MHz rather
than just 667MHz. Unfortunately I don't have access to any of documentation
of this other than some running systems, add a new cpufreq table entry for
this based on the behaviour of those systems.
