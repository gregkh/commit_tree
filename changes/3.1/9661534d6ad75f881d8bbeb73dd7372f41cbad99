powerpc/47x: allow kernel to be loaded in higher physical memory

The 44x code (which is shared by 47x) assumes the available physical memory
begins at 0x00000000.  This is not necessarily the case in an AMP
environment.

Support CONFIG_RELOCATABLE for 476 in order to allow the kernel to be
loaded into a higher memory range.
