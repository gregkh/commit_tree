e1000: Fix driver to be used on PA RISC C8000 workstations

The checksum field in the EEPROM on HPPA is really not a
checksum but a signature (0x16d6).  So allow 0x16d6 as the
matching checksum on HPPA systems.

This issue is present on longterm/stable kernels, I have
verified that this patch is applicable back to at least
2.6.32.y kernels.

v2- changed ifdef to use CONFIG_PARISC instead of __hppa__
