block/genhd.c: remove useless cast in diskstats_show()

Remove the (unsigned long long) cast in diskstats_show() and adjusts the
seq_printf() format string to 'unsigned long'

diskstats_show() uses part_stat_read() to get the stats, which either
accesses the specified field in the struct disk_stats directly (non SMP)
or sums up the per CPU values in a variable of the same type as the field,
so in any case the result will have the same type and range as the
specified field which for all disk_stats entries is unsigned long

Also, for unsigned long ranges the output of %lu should be identical to
the one of %llu, so no change in the actual proc entry contents.
