ALSA: hda - Add a workaround for invalid line-out setups

Some BIOS set up the pin config wrongly as line-out although it's
supposed to be a speaker out.  In most cases, though, we can judge
the validity by checking the connection type -- when it's FIXED,
mostly it's an invalid line-out but a speaker.
