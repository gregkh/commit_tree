net/ps3: Fix gelic RX DMA restart

Fix the condition where PS3 network RX hangs when no network
TX is occurring by calling gelic_card_enable_rxdmac() during
RX_DMA_CHAIN_END event processing.

The gelic hardware automatically clears its RX_DMA_EN flag when
it detects an RX_DMA_CHAIN_END event.  In its processing of
RX_DMA_CHAIN_END the gelic driver is required to set RX_DMA_EN
(with a call to gelic_card_enable_rxdmac()) to restart RX DMA
transfers.  The existing gelic driver code does not set
RX_DMA_EN directly in its processing of the RX_DMA_CHAIN_END
event, but uses a flag variable card->rx_dma_restart_required
to schedule the setting of RX_DMA_EN until next inside the
interrupt handler.

It seems this delayed setting of RX_DMA_EN causes the hang since
the next RX interrupt after the RX_DMA_CHAIN_END event where
RX_DMA_EN is scheduled to be set will not occur since RX_DMA_EN
was not set.  In the case were network TX is occuring, RX_DMA_EN
is set in the next TX interrupt and RX processing continues.
