ALSA: hda - Don't spew too many ELD errors

Currently HD-audio driver shows the all error ELD byte as an error
in the kernel message.  This is annoying when the video driver doesn't
set the correct ELD from the beginning. e.g. radeon sends a zero-byte
data, but we still check ELD with the fixed 128 byte as a workaround
for some broken devices, it spews 128-times errors.

For avoiding this, the driver aborts reading when the first byte is
invalid.  In such a case, the whole data is certainly invalid.
