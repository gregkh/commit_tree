[media] marvell-cam: Pass sensor parameters from the platform

Depending on the controller, the ov7670 sensor may be told to work with a
different clock speed or to use the SMBUS protocol.  Remove the wired-in
code and pass that information from the platform layer.  The Cafe driver
now just assumes it's running on an OLPC XO 1; I do not believe it has ever
run anywhere else.
