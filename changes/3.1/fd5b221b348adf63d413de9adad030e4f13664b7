xen/pciback: guest SR-IOV support for PV guest

These changes are for PV guest to use Virtual Function. Because the VF's
vendor, device registers in cfg space are 0xffff, which are invalid and
ignored by PCI device scan. Values in 'struct pci_dev' are fixed up by
SR-IOV code, and using these values will present correct VID and DID to
PV guest kernel.

And command registers in the cfg space are read only 0, which means we
have to emulate MMIO enable bit (VF only uses MMIO  resource) so PV
kernel can work properly.
