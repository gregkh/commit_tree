KVM: nVMX: vmcs12 checks on nested entry

This patch adds a bunch of tests of the validity of the vmcs12 fields,
according to what the VMX spec and our implementation allows. If fields
we cannot (or don't want to) honor are discovered, an entry failure is
emulated.

According to the spec, there are two types of entry failures: If the problem
was in vmcs12's host state or control fields, the VMLAUNCH instruction simply
fails. But a problem is found in the guest state, the behavior is more
similar to that of an exit.
