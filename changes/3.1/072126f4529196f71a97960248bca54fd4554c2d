ftrace: Update filter when tracing enabled in set_ftrace_filter()

Currently, if set_ftrace_filter() is called when the ftrace_ops is
active, the function filters will not be updated. They will only be updated
when tracing is disabled and re-enabled.

Update the functions immediately during set_ftrace_filter().
