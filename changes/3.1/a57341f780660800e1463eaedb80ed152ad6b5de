OMAP4: powerdomain data: Remove unsupported MPU powerdomain state

On OMAP4430 devices, because of boot ROM code bug, MPU OFF state can't
be attempted independently. When coming out of MPU OFF state, ROM code
disables the clocks of IVAHD, TESLA which is not desirable. Hence the
MPU OFF state is not usable on OMAP4430 devices.

OMAP4460 onwards, MPU OFF state will be descoped completely because
the DDR firewall falls in MPU power domain. When the MPU hit OFF state,
DDR won't be accessible for other initiators. The deepest state supported
is open switch retention (OSWR) just like CORE and PER PD on OMAP4430.

So in summary MPU power domain OFF state is not supported on OMAP4
and onwards designs. Thanks to new PRCM design, device off mode can
still be achieved with power domains hitting OSWR state.
