drm/i915: Combine pinning with setting to the display plane

We need to perform a few operations in order to move the object into the
display plane (where it can be accessed coherently by the display
engine) that are important for future safety to forbid whilst pinned. As a
result, we want to need to perform some of the operations before pinning,
but some are required once we have been bound into the GTT. So combine
the pinning performed by all the callers with set_to_display_plane(), so
this complication is contained within the single function.
