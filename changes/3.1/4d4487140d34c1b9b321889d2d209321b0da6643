arm: remove "optimized" SHA1 routines

Since commit 1eb19a12bd22 ("lib/sha1: use the git implementation of
SHA-1"), the ARM SHA1 routines no longer work.  The reason? They
depended on the larger 320-byte workspace, and now the sha1 workspace is
just 16 words (64 bytes).  So the assembly version would overwrite the
stack randomly.

The optimized asm version is also probably slower than the new improved
C version, so there's no reason to keep it around.  At least that was
the case in git, where what appears to be the same assembly language
version was removed two years ago because the optimized C BLK_SHA1 code
was faster.
