ftrace/recordmcount: Add helper function get_sym_str_and_relp()

The code to get the symbol, string, and relp pointers in the two functions
sift_rel_mcount() and nop_mcount() are identical and also non-trivial.
Moving this duplicate code into a single helper function makes the code
easier to read and more maintainable.
