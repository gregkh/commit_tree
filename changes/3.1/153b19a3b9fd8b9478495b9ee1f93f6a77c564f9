x86, mrst: use a temporary variable for SFI irq

SFI tables reside in RAM and should not be modified once they are
written.  Current code went to set pentry->irq to zero which causes
subsequent reads to fail with invalid SFI table checksum.  This will
break kexec as the second kernel fails to validate SFI tables.

To fix this we use temporary variable for irq number.
