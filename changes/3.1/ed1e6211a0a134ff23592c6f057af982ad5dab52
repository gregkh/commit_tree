NFSv4: Don't use the delegation->inode in nfs_mark_return_delegation()

nfs_mark_return_delegation() is usually called without any locking, and
so it is not safe to dereference delegation->inode. Since the inode is
only used to discover the nfs_client anyway, it makes more sense to
have the callers pass a valid pointer to the nfs_server as a parameter.
