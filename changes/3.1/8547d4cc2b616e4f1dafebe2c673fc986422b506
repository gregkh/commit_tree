Staging: usbip: vhci-hcd: Do not kill already dead RX/TX kthread

When unbinding a device on the host which was still attached on the
client, I got a NULL pointer dereference on the client. This turned out
to be due to kthread_stop() being called on an already dead kthread.

Here is how I was able to reproduce the problem:

 server:# usbip bind -b 1-2
                                client:# usbip attach -h server -b 1-2
 server:# usbip unbind -b 1-2

This patch fixes the problem by checking the kthread before attempting
to kill it, as it is done on the opposite side in
stub_shutdown_connection().
