xen: use non-tracing preempt in xen_clocksource_read()

The tracing code used sched_clock() to get tracing timestamps, which
ends up calling xen_clocksource_read().  xen_clocksource_read() must
disable preemption, but if preemption tracing is enabled, this results
in infinite recursion.

I've only noticed this when boot-time tracing tests are enabled, but it
seems like a generic bug.  It looks like it would also affect
kvm_clocksource_read().
