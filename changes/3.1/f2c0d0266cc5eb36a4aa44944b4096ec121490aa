cap_syslog: don't use WARN_ONCE for CAP_SYS_ADMIN deprecation warning

syslog-ng versions before 3.3.0beta1 (2011-05-12) assume that
CAP_SYS_ADMIN is sufficient to access syslog, so ever since CAP_SYSLOG
was introduced (2010-11-25) they have triggered a warning.

Commit ee24aebffb75 ("cap_syslog: accept CAP_SYS_ADMIN for now")
improved matters a little by making syslog-ng work again, just keeping
the WARN_ONCE().  But still, this is a warning that writes a stack trace
we don't care about to syslog, sets a taint flag, and alarms sysadmins
when nothing worse has happened than use of an old userspace with a
recent kernel.

Convert the WARN_ONCE to a printk_once to avoid that while continuing to
give userspace developers a hint that this is an unwanted
backward-compatibility feature and won't be around forever.
