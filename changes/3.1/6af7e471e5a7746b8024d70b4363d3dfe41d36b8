alarmtimers: Avoid possible denial of service with high freq periodic timers

Its possible to jam up the alarm timers by setting very small interval
timers, which will cause the alarmtimer subsystem to spend all of its time
firing and restarting timers. This can effectivly lock up a box.

A deeper fix is needed, closely mimicking the hrtimer code, but for now
just cap the interval to 100us to avoid userland hanging the system.
