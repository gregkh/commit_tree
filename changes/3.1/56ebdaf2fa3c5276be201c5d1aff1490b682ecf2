block: simplify force plug flush code a little bit

Cleaning up the code a little bit. attempt_plug_merge() traverses the plug
list anyway, we can do the request counting there, so stack size is reduced
a little bit.
The motivation here is I suspect if we should count the requests for each
queue (task could handle multiple disks in the meantime), but my test doesn't
show it's worthy doing. If somebody proves we should do it, below change
will make that more easier.
