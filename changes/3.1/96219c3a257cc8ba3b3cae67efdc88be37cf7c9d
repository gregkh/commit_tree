i2c-tegra: fix possible race condition after tx

In tegra_i2c_fill_tx_fifo, once we have finished pushing all the bytes
to the I2C hardware controller, the interrupt might happen before we
have updated i2c_dev->msg_buf_remaining at the end of the function.
Then, in tegra_i2c_isr, we will call again tegra_i2c_fill_tx_fifo
triggering weird behaviour. This has been shown to happen under real
conditions.
