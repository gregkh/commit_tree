KVM: nVMX: Add "nested" module option to kvm_intel

This patch adds to kvm_intel a module option "nested". This option controls
whether the guest can use VMX instructions, i.e., whether we allow nested
virtualization. A similar, but separate, option already exists for the
SVM module.

This option currently defaults to 0, meaning that nested VMX must be
explicitly enabled by giving nested=1. When nested VMX matures, the default
should probably be changed to enable nested VMX by default - just like
nested SVM is currently enabled by default.
