memcg: export memory cgroup's swappiness with mem_cgroup_swappiness()

Each memory cgroup has a 'swappiness' value which can be accessed by
get_swappiness(memcg).  The major user is try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages()
and swappiness is passed by argument.  It's propagated by scan_control.

get_swappiness() is a static function but some planned updates will need
to get swappiness from files other than memcontrol.c This patch exports
get_swappiness() as mem_cgroup_swappiness().  With this, we can remove the
argument of swapiness from try_to_free...  and drop swappiness from
scan_control.  only memcg uses it.
