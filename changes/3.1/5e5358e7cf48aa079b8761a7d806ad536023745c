mm: cleanup descriptions of filler arg

The often-NULL data arg to read_cache_page() and read_mapping_page()
functions is misdescribed as "destination for read data": no, it's the
first arg to the filler function, often struct file * to ->readpage().

Satisfy checkpatch.pl on those filler prototypes, and tidy up the
declarations in linux/pagemap.h.
