net: Cap number of elements for sendmmsg

To limit the amount of time we can spend in sendmmsg, cap the
number of elements to UIO_MAXIOV (currently 1024).

For error handling an application using sendmmsg needs to retry at
the first unsent message, so capping is simpler and requires less
application logic than returning EINVAL.
