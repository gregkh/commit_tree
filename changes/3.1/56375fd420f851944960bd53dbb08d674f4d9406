PM / Domains: Queue up power off work only if it is not pending

In theory it is possible that pm_genpd_poweroff() for two different
subdomains of the same parent domain will attempt to queue up the
execution of pm_genpd_poweroff() for the parent twice in a row.  This
would lead to unpleasant consequences, so prevent it from happening
by checking if genpd->power_off_work is pending before attempting to
queue it up.
