xfs: cleanup I/O-related buffer flags

Remove the unused and misnamed _XBF_RUN_QUEUES flag, rename XBF_LOG_BUFFER
to the more fitting XBF_SYNCIO, and split XBF_ORDERED into XBF_FUA and
XBF_FLUSH to allow more fine grained control over the bio flags.  Also
cleanup processing of the flags in _xfs_buf_ioapply to make more sense,
and renumber the sparse flag number space to group flags by purpose.
