ALSA: hda - Cirrus Logic CS421x support

This update includes the changes necessary for supporting the
CS421x family of codecs.  Previously this file only supported
the CS420x family of codecs.

This file also contains init verbs to correct several issues in
the CS421x hardware.

Behavior between the CS421x and CS420x codec families is similar,
so several functions have been reused with "if" statements to
determine which codec family (CS421x or CS420x) is present.

Also, this file will be updated sometime in the near future in
order to add support for a system using CS421x that requires
mono mix on the speaker output only.
