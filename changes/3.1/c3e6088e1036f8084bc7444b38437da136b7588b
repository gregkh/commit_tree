ACPI, APEI, EINJ Param support is disabled by default

EINJ parameter support is only usable for some specific BIOS.
Originally, it is expected to have no harm for BIOS does not support
it.  But now, we found it will cause issue (memory overwriting) for
some BIOS.  So param support is disabled by default and only enabled
when newly added module parameter named "param_extension" is
explicitly specified.
