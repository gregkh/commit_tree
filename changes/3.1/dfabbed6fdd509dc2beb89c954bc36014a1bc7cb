ceph: set dir complete frag after adding capability

Curretly ceph_add_cap clears the complete bit if we are newly issued the
FILE_SHARED cap, which is normally the case for a newly issue cap on a new
directory.  That means we clear the just-set bit.  Move the check that sets
the flag to after the cap is added/updated.
