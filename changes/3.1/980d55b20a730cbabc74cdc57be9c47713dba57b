batman-adv: keep global table consistency in case of roaming

To keep consistency of other originator tables, new clients detected as
roamed, are kept in the global table but are marked as TT_CLIENT_PENDING
They are purged only when the new ttvn is received by the corresponding
originator. Moreover they need to be considered as removed in case of global
transtable lookup.
