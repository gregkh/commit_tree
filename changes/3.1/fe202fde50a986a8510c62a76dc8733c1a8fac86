PM / Domains: Fix pm_genpd_poweron()

The local variable ret is defined twice in pm_genpd_poweron(), which
causes this function to always return 0, even if the PM domain's
.power_on() callback fails, in which case an error code should be
returned.

Remove the wrong second definition of ret and additionally remove an
unnecessary definition of wait from pm_genpd_poweron().
