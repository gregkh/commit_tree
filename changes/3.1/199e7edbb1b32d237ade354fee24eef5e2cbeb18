usb: gadget: chips: remove ifdef trickery

the gadget controller number is only used
during bind() to update descriptors and/or
check that a particular controller can support
a particular gadget driver.

Because of that, we can remove the ifdef
trickery as it's a rather small optimization
anyway.

While at that, also sort the entries
alphabetically and add a comment stating we
want to keep the list ordered alphabetically.
