HWPoison: add memory_failure_queue()

memory_failure() is the entry point for HWPoison memory error
recovery.  It must be called in process context.  But commonly
hardware memory errors are notified via MCE or NMI, so some delayed
execution mechanism must be used.  In MCE handler, a work queue + ring
buffer mechanism is used.

In addition to MCE, now APEI (ACPI Platform Error Interface) GHES
(Generic Hardware Error Source) can be used to report memory errors
too.  To add support to APEI GHES memory recovery, a mechanism similar
to that of MCE is implemented.  memory_failure_queue() is the new
entry point that can be called in IRQ context.  The next step is to
make MCE handler uses this interface too.
