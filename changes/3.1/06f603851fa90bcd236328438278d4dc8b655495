md/raid1: avoid reading known bad blocks during resync

When performing resync/etc, keep the size of the request
small enough that it doesn't overlap any known bad blocks.
Devices with badblocks at the start of the request are completely
excluded.
If there is nowhere to read from due to bad blocks, record
a bad block on each target device.

Now that we never read from known-bad-blocks we can allow devices with
known-bad-blocks into a RAID1.
