ARM: realview: ensure visibility of writes during reset

The various reset routines in mach-realview rely on an FPGA to
power-cycle the board after writing some magic runes to memory-mapped
registers.

This patch adds a dsb() following the writes, so that they become
visible before we mdelay(1000) in the arch_reset code. Without this
patch, the timeout would expire sporadically, causing the reset to fail.
