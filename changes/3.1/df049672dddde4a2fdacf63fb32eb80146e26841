x86: tsc: Remove unneeded DMI-based blacklisting

The blacklist was added in response to my bug report
(http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/19/362) and has never
contained more than the one entry describing my old
now dead ThinkPad 380XD laptop. As found out later
(http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/29/50), this special
treatment has been unnecessary for a long time, so
it can be removed.
