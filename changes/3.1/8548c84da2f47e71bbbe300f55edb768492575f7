x86: Fix S4 regression

Commit 4b239f458 ("x86-64, mm: Put early page table high") causes a S4
regression since 2.6.39, namely the machine reboots occasionally at S4
resume.  It doesn't happen always, overall rate is about 1/20.  But,
like other bugs, once when this happens, it continues to happen.

This patch fixes the problem by essentially reverting the memory
assignment in the older way.
