md/raid5: move stripe_head_state and more code into handle_stripe.

By defining the 'stripe_head_state' in 'handle_stripe', we can move
some common code out of handle_stripe[56]() and into handle_stripe.

The means that all accesses for stripe_head_state in handle_stripe[56]
need to be 's->' instead of 's.', but the compiler should inline
those functions and just use a direct stack reference, and future
patches while hoist most of this code up into handle_stripe()
so we will revert to "s.".
