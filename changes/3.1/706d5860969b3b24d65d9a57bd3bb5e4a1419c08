target: Add WRITE_SAME (10) parsing and refactor passthrough checks

This patch adds initial WRITE_SAME (10) w/ UNMAP=1 support following updates in
sbcr26 to allow UNMAP=1 for the non 16 + 32 byte CDB case.  It also refactors
current pSCSI passthrough passthrough checks into target_check_write_same_discard()
ahead of UNMAP=0 w/ write payload support into target_core_iblock.c.

This includes the support for handling WRITE_SAME in transport_emulate_control_cdb(),
and converts target_emulate_write_same to accept num_blocks directly for
WRITE_SAME, WRITE_SAME_16 and WRITE_SAME_32.
