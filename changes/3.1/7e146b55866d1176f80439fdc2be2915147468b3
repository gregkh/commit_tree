ASoC: soc-cache: Cache a pointer to the last accessed rbnode

Whenever we are doing a read or a write through the rbtree code, we'll
cache a pointer to the rbnode.  To avoid looking up the register
everytime we do a read or a write, we first check if it can be found in
the cached register block, otherwise we traverse the rbtree and finally
cache the rbnode for future use.
