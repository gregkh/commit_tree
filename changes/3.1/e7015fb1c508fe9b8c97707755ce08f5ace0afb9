CIFS: Simplify socket reading in demultiplex thread

Move reading to separate function and remove csocket variable.

Also change semantic in a little: goto incomplete_rcv only when
we get -EAGAIN (or a familiar error) while reading rfc1002 header.
In this case we don't check for echo timeout when we don't get whole
header at once, as it was before.
