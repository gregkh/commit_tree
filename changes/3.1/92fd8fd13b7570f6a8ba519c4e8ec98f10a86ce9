drm/i915: Use dp_detect_common in hotplug helper function

This uses the common dpcd reading routine, i915_dp_detect_common,
instead of open-coding a call to intel_dp_aux_native_read. Besides
reducing duplicated code, this also gains the read retries which
may be necessary when a cable is first plugged back in and the link
needs to be retrained.
