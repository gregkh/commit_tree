Input: wm97xx - mark channels which need pen_down

Currently, battery drivers also use poll_sample() provided by the
wm97xx-core but this code always checks if the pen is down. Mark the
channels which really need this (i.e. for the touchscreen) with the
PEN_DOWN bit, and skip the checks otherwise. Now, the battery channels
can always be read.
