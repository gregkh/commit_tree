perf, x86: P4 PMU - Introduce event alias feature

Instead of hw_nmi_watchdog_set_attr() weak function
and appropriate x86_pmu::hw_watchdog_set_attr() call
we introduce even alias mechanism which allow us
to drop this routines completely and isolate quirks
of Netburst architecture inside P4 PMU code only.

The main idea remains the same though -- to allow
nmi-watchdog and perf top run simultaneously.

Note the aliasing mechanism applies to generic
PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES event only because arbitrary
event (say passed as RAW initially) might have some
additional bits set inside ESCR register changing
the behaviour of event and we can't guarantee anymore
that alias event will give the same result.

P.S. Thanks a huge to Don and Steven for for testing
     and early review.
