superblock: add filesystem shrinker operations

Now we have a per-superblock shrinker implementation, we can add a
filesystem specific callout to it to allow filesystem internal
caches to be shrunk by the superblock shrinker.

Rather than perpetuate the multipurpose shrinker callback API (i.e.
nr_to_scan == 0 meaning "tell me how many objects freeable in the
cache), two operations will be added. The first will return the
number of objects that are freeable, the second is the actual
shrinker call.
