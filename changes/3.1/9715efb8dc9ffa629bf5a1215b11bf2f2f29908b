ARM: 6984/1: enhance TCM robustness

The PB11MPCore reports "3" DTCM banks, but anything above 2 is an
"undefined" value, so push this to become 0. Further add some checks
if code is compiled to TCM even if there is no D/ITCM present in the
system, and if we can really fit the compiled code. We don't do the
BUG() since it's not helpful, it's better to deal with non-present
TCM dynamically. If there is nothing compiled to the TCM and no TCM
is detected, it will now just shut up even if TCM support is enabled.
