[media] drxk: Add a fallback method for QAM parameter setting

The QAM standard is set using this scu_command:
	SCU_RAM_COMMAND_STANDARD_QAM |
	SCU_RAM_COMMAND_CMD_DEMOD_SET_PARAM

The driver implements a version that has 4 parameters, however,
Terratec H5 needs to break this into two separate commands, otherwise,
DVB-C doesn't work.

With this fix, scan is now properly working and getting the
channel list:
>>> tune to: 609000000:INVERSION_AUTO:5217000:FEC_3_4:QAM_256
>>> tuning status == 0x00
>>> tuning status == 0x07
>>> tuning status == 0x1f
