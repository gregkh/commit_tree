OMAP4: hwmod: Replace CLKCTRL absolute address with offset macros

The CLKCTRL register was accessed using an absolute address.
The usage of hardcoded macros to calculate virtual address from physical
one should be avoided as much as possible.
The usage of a offset will allow future improvement like migration from
the current architecture code toward a module driver.

Update cm_xxx accessor, move definition to the proper header file and
update copyrights.
