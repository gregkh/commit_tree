x86/PCI: reduce severity of host bridge window conflict warnings

Host bridge windows are top-level resources, so if we find a host bridge
window conflict, it's probably with a hard-coded legacy reservation.
Moving host bridge windows is theoretically possible, but we don't support
it; we just ignore windows with conflicts, and it's not worth making this
a user-visible error.
