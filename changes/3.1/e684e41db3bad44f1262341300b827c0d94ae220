md/raid10: simplify read error handling during recovery.

If a read error is detected during recovery the code currently
fails the read device.
This isn't really necessary.  recovery_request_write will signal
a write error to end_sync_write and it will record a write
error on the destination device which will record a bad block
there or kick it from the array.

So just remove this call to do md_error.
