UBIFS: use correct flags in lprops

The UBIFS lpt tree is in many aspects similar to the TNC tree, and we have
similar flags for these trees. And by mistake we use the COW_ZNODE flag for
LPT in some places, instead of the right flag COW_CNODE. And this works
only because these two constants have the same value.

This patch makes all the LPT code to use COW_CNODE and also changes COW_CNODE
constant value to make sure we do not misuse the flags any more.
