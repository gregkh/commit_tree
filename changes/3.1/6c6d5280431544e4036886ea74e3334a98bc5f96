pagewalk: don't look up vma if walk->hugetlb_entry is unused

Currently, walk_page_range() calls find_vma() every page table for walk
iteration.  but it's completely unnecessary if walk->hugetlb_entry is
unused.  And we don't have to assume find_vma() is a lightweight
operation.  So this patch checks the walk->hugetlb_entry and avoids the
find_vma() call if possible.

This patch also makes some cleanups.  1) remove ugly uninitialized_var()
and 2) #ifdef in function body.
