pagewalk: add locking-rule comments

Originally, walk_hugetlb_range() didn't require a caller take any lock.
But commit d33b9f45bd ("mm: hugetlb: fix hugepage memory leak in
walk_page_range") changed its rule.  Because it added find_vma() call in
walk_hugetlb_range().

Any locking-rule change commit should write a doc too.
