iwlagn: Enable/disable PS poll based on RSSI and BT coex traffic state

WiFi throughput drops drastically when BT is turned on, BT and WiFi
are simultaneously transmitting/receiving traffic. This is particularly true
when BT has higher priority over WiFi, and hence the device defers TX frames.
The AP assumes that the channel is bad and reduces the data rate, implying
longer airtime, which exacerbates the problem further, resulting ultimately
in what is popularly called the "death-spiral" phenomenon. The use of PS-poll
in such scenarios guarantees a low but consistent throughput.

Since the death-spiral phenomenon is observed only when the RSSI is low, use
PS-poll only when RSSI is low and disable when high, with a known hysterisis.

This feature specifies the high and low thresholds and implements the
callbacks registered with mac80211, which will be called when threshold events
occur.
