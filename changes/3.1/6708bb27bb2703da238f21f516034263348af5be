target: Follow up core updates from AGrover and HCH (round 4)

This patch contains the squashed version of forth round series cleanups
from Andy and Christoph following the post heavy lifting in the preceeding:
'Eliminate usage of struct se_mem' and 'Make all control CDBs scatter-gather'
changes.  This also includes a conversion of target core and the v3.0
mainline fabric modules (loopback and tcm_fc) to use pr_debug and the
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG infrastructure!

These have been squashed into this third and final round for v3.1.

target: Remove ifdeffed code in t_g_process_write
target: Remove direct ramdisk code
target: Rename task_sg_num to task_sg_nents
target: Remove custom debug macros for pr_debug. Use pr_err().
target: Remove custom debug macros in mainline fabrics
target: Set WSNZ=1 in block limits VPD. Abort if WRITE_SAME sectors = 0
target: Remove transport do_se_mem_map callback
target: Further simplify transport_free_pages
target: Redo task allocation return value handling
target: Remove extra parentheses
target: change alloc_task call to take *cdb, not *cmd
