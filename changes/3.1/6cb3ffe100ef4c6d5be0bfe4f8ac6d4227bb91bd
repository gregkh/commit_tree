crypto: omap-sham - remove dedicated queue handling tasklet

Calling omap_sham_handle_queue from "done" tasklet should be done
after irq scheduled tasklet completes.
Having additional tasklet does not solve that issue because it might
be execute before.
So queue handling tasklet has been removed and functionality integrated
into single tasklet.
