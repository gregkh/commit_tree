exofs: Add offset/length to exofs_get_io_state

In future raid code we will need to know the IO offset/length
and if it's a read or write to determine some of the array
sizes we'll need.

So add a new exofs_get_rw_state() API for use when
writeing/reading. All other simple cases are left using the
old way.

The major change to this is that now we need to call
exofs_get_io_state later at inode.c::read_exec and
inode.c::write_exec when we actually know these things. So this
patch is kept separate so I can test things apart from other
changes.
