[media] Make Compro VideoMate Vista T750F actually work

Based on the work of John Newbigin, Davor Emard and others who contributed
on the mailing lists.

The previous 'support' for this card was a partial merge of John's changes
that, as far as I can tell, never actually got the thing working (no DVB-T,
analog tuner not initialised).

Initialise the analog tuner properly and hook up the DVB tuner and demodulator.

DVB-T and analog now work (though I can't tune every DVB channel, but I think
there's an issue with the aerial and signal boosters here that is causing
me problems).
