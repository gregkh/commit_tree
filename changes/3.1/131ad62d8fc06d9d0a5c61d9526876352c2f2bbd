netfilter: add SELinux context support to AUDIT target

In this revision the conversion of secid to SELinux context and adding it
to the audit log is moved from xt_AUDIT.c to audit.c with the aid of a
separate helper function - audit_log_secctx - which does both the conversion
and logging of SELinux context, thus also preventing internal secid number
being leaked to userspace. If conversion is not successful an error is raised.

With the introduction of this helper function the work done in xt_AUDIT.c is
much more simplified. It also opens the possibility of this helper function
being used by other modules (including auditd itself), if desired. With this
addition, typical (raw auditd) output after applying the patch would be:
