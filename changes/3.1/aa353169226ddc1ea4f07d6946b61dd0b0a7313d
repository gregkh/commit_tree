mach-qt2410: convert to spi_gpio

Rather than the deprecated spi_s3c24xx_gpio driver.

Only compile tested. Notice that the board support seems quite broken
as the spi_s3c24xx_gpio platform device name was misspelled and there
is no struct spi_board_info defined, but this atleast didn't make it
any worse.
