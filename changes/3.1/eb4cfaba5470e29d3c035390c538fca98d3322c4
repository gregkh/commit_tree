staging/easycap: Fix thinko in "bars" module option description

Both bars=0 and bars=1 were described as meaning to display bars on
signal lost. Actually bars=1 means "display bars", but bars=0 means
display raw source as is (usually black screen).

Instead of changing bars=0 to "_no_ testcard bars ..." as suggested by
Dan Carpenter reword the whole bars description for clarity.
