PM: Introduce generic "noirq" callback routines for subsystems (v2)

Introduce generic "noirq" power management callback routines for
subsystems in addition to the "regular" generic PM callback routines.

The new routines will be used, among other things, for implementing
system-wide PM transitions support for generic PM domains.
