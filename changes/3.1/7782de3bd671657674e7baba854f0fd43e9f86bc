drm/i915: Disable FBC across page-flipping

Page-flipping updates the scanout address, nukes the FBC compressed
image and so forces an FBC update so that the displayed image remains
consistent. However, page-flipping does not update the FBC registers
themselves, which remain pointing to both the old address and the old
CPU fence. Future updates to the new front-buffer (scanout) are then
undetected!

This first approach to demonstrate the issue and highlight the fix,
simply disables FBC upon page-flip (a recompression will be forced on
every flip so FBC becomes immaterial) and then re-enables FBC in the
page-flip finish work function, so that the FBC registers are now
pointing to the new framebuffer and front-buffer rendering works once
more.

Ideally, we want to only re-enable FBC after page-flipping is complete,
as otherwise we are just wasting cycles and power (with needless
recompression) whilst the page-flipping application is still running.
