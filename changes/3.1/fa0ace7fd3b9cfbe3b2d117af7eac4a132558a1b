staging: brcm80211: minor cleanup in initvars_srom_pci()

The error handling code labelled with errout: did a conditional kfree(). The
last error jump to the label is upon failure of the kmalloc() for which the
conditional kfree() is done. Therefor, the kfree is moved before the error
label and done unconditionally.
