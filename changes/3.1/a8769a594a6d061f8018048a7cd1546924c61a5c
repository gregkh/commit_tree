ARM: EXYNOS4: set the affinity of mct1 interrupt using IRQ_MCT_L1

IRQ_MCT_L1 is connected directly to GIC in external GIC mapping,
while in internal GIC mapping, it is connected to GIC through
interrupt combiner. Therfore the affinity for mct1 event timer
interrupt should be changed through IRQ_MCT_L1.
