Btrfs: don't print the leaf if we had an error

In __btrfs_free_extent we will print the leaf if we fail to find the extent we
wanted, but the problem is if we get an error we won't have a leaf so often this
leads to a NULL pointer dereference and we lose the error that actually
occurred.  So only print the leaf if ret > 0, which means we didn't find the
item we were looking for but we didn't error either.  This way the error is
preserved.
