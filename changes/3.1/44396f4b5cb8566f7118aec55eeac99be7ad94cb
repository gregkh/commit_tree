fs: add a DCACHE_NEED_LOOKUP flag for d_flags

Btrfs (and I'd venture most other fs's) stores its indexes in nice disk order
for readdir, but unfortunately in the case of anything that stats the files in
order that readdir spits back (like oh say ls) that means we still have to do
the normal lookup of the file, which means looking up our other index and then
looking up the inode.  What I want is a way to create dummy dentries when we
find them in readdir so that when ls or anything else subsequently does a
stat(), we already have the location information in the dentry and can go
straight to the inode itself.  The lookup stuff just assumes that if it finds a
dentry it is done, it doesn't perform a lookup.  So add a DCACHE_NEED_LOOKUP
flag so that the lookup code knows it still needs to run i_op->lookup() on the
parent to get the inode for the dentry.  I have tested this with btrfs and I
went from something that looks like this

Thats a savings of 1300 seconds, or 22 minutes.  That is a significant savings.
