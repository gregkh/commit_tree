redefine thread_group_leader() as exit_signal >= 0

Change de_thread() to set old_leader->exit_signal = -1. This is
good for the consistency, it is no longer the leader and all
sub-threads have exit_signal = -1 set by copy_process(CLONE_THREAD).

And this allows us to micro-optimize thread_group_leader(), it can
simply check exit_signal >= 0. This also makes sense because we
should move ->group_leader from task_struct to signal_struct.
