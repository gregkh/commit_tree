tracing: Add a proc file to stop tracing and free buffer

The proc file entry buffer_size_kb is used to set the size of tracing
buffer. The memory to expand the buffer size is kernel memory. Consider
a use case where tracing is handled by a user space utility, which acts
as a gate keeper for tracing requests. In an OOM condition, tracing is
considered a low priority task and if the utility gets killed the ring
buffer memory cannot be released back to the kernel.

This patch adds a proc file called "free_buffer" whose purpose is to
stop tracing and free up the ring buffer when it is closed.

The user space process can then set the desired size in buffer_size_kb
file and open the fd to the "free_buffer" file. Under OOM condition, if
the process gets killed, the kernel closes the file descriptor. The
release handler stops the tracing and releases the kernel memory
automatically.
