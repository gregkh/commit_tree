mm/backing-dev.c: reset bdi min_ratio in bdi_unregister()

Vito said:

: The system has many usb disks coming and going day to day, with their
: respective bdi's having min_ratio set to 1 when inserted.  It works for
: some time until eventually min_ratio can no longer be set, even when the
: active set of bdi's seen in /sys/class/bdi/*/min_ratio doesn't add up to
: anywhere near 100.
:
: This then leads to an unrelated starvation problem caused by write-heavy
: fuse mounts being used atop the usb disks, a problem the min_ratio setting
: at the underlying devices bdi effectively prevents.

Fix this leakage by resetting the bdi min_ratio when unregistering the
BDI.
