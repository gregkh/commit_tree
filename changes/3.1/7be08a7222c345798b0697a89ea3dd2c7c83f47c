bnx2x: Renaming the "reset_task" to "sp_rtnl_task"

Renaming the "reset_task" to a more general purpose name,
 "sp_rtnl_task", as it is already used for another purpose
 other than reset which is parity recovery, and since I
 plan to add a third operation for this task, updating the
 priority to traffic class and traffic class to transmission
 queues mappings after dcbx negotiation takes place.
