powerpc/fsl_pci: Simplify matching logic for PCI_FIXUP_HEADER

We fixup every FSL PCIe Root Complex we need to fixup a few things.
Rather than adding every device under the sun we move to just matching
only on the vendor (PCI_VENDOR_ID_FREESCALE) and than check that we are
a PCIe controller in host mode in the fixup.
