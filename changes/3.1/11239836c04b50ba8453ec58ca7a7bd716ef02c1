oom: remove references to old badness() function

The badness() function in the oom killer was renamed to oom_badness() in
a63d83f427fb ("oom: badness heuristic rewrite") since it is a globally
exported function for clarity.

The prototype for the old function still existed in linux/oom.h, so remove
it.  There are no existing users.

Also fixes documentation and comment references to badness() and adjusts
them accordingly.
