exofs: Rename raid engine from exofs/ios.c => ore

ORE stands for "Objects Raid Engine"

This patch is a mechanical rename of everything that was in ios.c
and its API declaration to an ore.c and an osd_ore.h header. The ore
engine will later be used by the pnfs objects layout driver.

* File ios.c => ore.c

* Declaration of types and API are moved from exofs.h to a new
  osd_ore.h

* All used types are prefixed by ore_ from their exofs_ name.

* Shift includes from exofs.h to osd_ore.h so osd_ore.h is
  independent, include it from exofs.h.

Other than a pure rename there are no other changes. Next patch
will move the ore into it's own module and will export the API
to be used by exofs and later the layout driver
