[media] v4l2-ctrls/event: remove struct v4l2_ctrl_fh, instead use v4l2_subscribed_event

The v4l2_ctrl_fh struct connected v4l2_ctrl with v4l2_fh so the control
would know which filehandles subscribed to it. However, it is much easier
to use struct v4l2_subscribed_event directly for that and get rid of that
intermediate struct.
