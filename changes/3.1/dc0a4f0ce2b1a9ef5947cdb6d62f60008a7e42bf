HID: Fix Logitech Driving Force Pro wheel

- Add the quirk "NOGET" to make the wheel work at all in native mode.
- Replace the somehow broken report descriptor with a custom one to have
  separate throttle and brake axes.

As there are significant differences in the descriptor (original descriptor
"hides" the separate axes in a  24 bit FF00 usagepage, new descripter replaces
that with two individual 8 bit desktop.y and desktop.rz usages) I provided a
complete replacement descriptor instead trying to patch the original one.
Patching the descriptor seems not feasible as the new one is much larger.

Note: To actually test this you have to use the tool "ltwheelconf" to put the
DFP into it's native mode - See below for more info.

Background:
Most Logitech wheels are initially reporting themselves with a "fallback"
deviceID (USB_DEVICE_ID_LOGITECH_WHEEL - 0xc294), in order to make sure they
are working even without having the proper driver installed.

If the Logitech driver is installed it sends a special command to the wheel
which sets the wheel to "native mode", enabling enhance features like:
- Clutch pedal
- extended wheel rotation range (up to 900 degrees)
- H-gate shifter
- separate axis for throttle / brake
- all buttons

When the wheel is set to native mode it basically disconnects and reconnects
with a different deviceID (USB_DEVICE_ID_LOGITECH_DFP_WHEEL - 0xc298 in this
case).

I am working on a userspace tool [1] which does the switching from fallback to
native mode. During development I found out that the Driving Force Pro wheel
is not supported in native mode - quierk NOGET is missing and the throttle and
brake axes are reported in a combined way only.
