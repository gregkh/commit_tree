UBIFS: switch self-check knobs to debugfs

UBIFS has many built-in self-check functions which can be enabled using the
debug_chks module parameter or the corresponding sysfs file
(/sys/module/ubifs/parameters/debug_chks). However, this is not flexible enough
because it is not per-filesystem. This patch moves this to debugfs interfaces.

We already have debugfs support, so this patch just adds more debugfs files.
While looking at debugfs support I've noticed that it is racy WRT file-system
unmount, and added a TODO entry for that. This problem has been there for long
time and it is quite standard debugfs PITA. The plan is to fix this later.

This patch is simple, but it is large because it changes many places where we
check if a particular type of checks is enabled or disabled.
