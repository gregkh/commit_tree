kconfig: fix missing "0x" prefix from S_HEX symbol in autoconf.h

The specialized printer for headers (espectially autoconf.h) is missing
fixup code for S_HEX symbol's "0x" prefix. As long as kconfig does not
warn for such missing prefix, this code is needed. Fix this.

In the same time, fix some nits in `header_print_symbol()'.
