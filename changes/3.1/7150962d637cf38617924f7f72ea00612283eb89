lib: crc8: add new library module providing crc8 algorithm

The brcm80211 driver in staging tree uses a crc8 function. Based on
feedback from John Linville to move this to lib directory, the linux
source has been searched. Although there is currently only one other
kernel driver using this algorithm (ie. drivers/ssb) we are providing
this as a library function for others to use.
