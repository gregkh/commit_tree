pstore: Add extra context for writes and erases

EFI only provides small amounts of individual storage, and conventionally
puts metadata in the storage variable name. Rather than add a metadata
header to the (already limited) variable storage, it's easier for us to
modify pstore to pass all the information we need to construct a unique
variable name to the appropriate functions.
