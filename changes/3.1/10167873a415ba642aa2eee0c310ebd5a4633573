OMAP2430: hwmod: musb: add missing terminator to omap2430_usbhsotg_addrs[]

Add a missing array terminator to omap2430_usbhsotg_addrs[].  Without
this terminator, the omap_hwmod resource building code runs off the
end of the array, resulting in at least this error -- if not worse
behavior:

[    0.578002] musb-omap2430: failed to claim resource 4
[    0.583465] omap_device: musb-omap2430: build failed (-16)
[    0.589294] Could not build omap_device for musb-omap2430 usb_otg_hs

This should have been part of commit
78183f3fdf76f422431a81852468be01b36db325 ("omap_hwmod: use a null
structure record to terminate omap_hwmod_addr_space arrays") but was
evidently missed.
