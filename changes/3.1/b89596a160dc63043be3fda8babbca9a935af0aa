ALSA: hda - Fix invalid multi-channel amplifiers for VT1718S

For VT1718S, the multi-channel path should be like following:
DAC 0-->Mixer 9(index 5)-->Mixer 0(index 1)-->Front Pin;
DAC 1-->Mixer 1(index 0)-->Surround Pin;
DAC 2-->C/LFE Pin;
DAC 3-->Mixer 2(index 0)-->Side Pin;

But current code built Surround and Side path through index 1 of
Mixer 1 and 2. So Adjusting Surround and Side channel amplifier is
invalid. This patch fixes the issue.
