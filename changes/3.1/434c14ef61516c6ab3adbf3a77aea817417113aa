staging: brcm80211: emptied wlioctl.h

Code cleanup. Broadcom specific ioctl functionality is not necessary
in the Linux world. Deleted unused defines and structs from wlioctl.h.
Moved softmac specific items from wlioctl.h to softmac header files,
same for fullmac items. Moved shared fullmac/softmac definitions to other
header files.
