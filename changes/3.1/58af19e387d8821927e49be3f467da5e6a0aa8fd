tproxy: copy transparent flag when creating a time wait

The transparent socket option setting was not copied to the time wait
socket when an inet socket was being replaced by a time wait socket. This
broke the --transparent option of the socket match and may have caused
that FIN packets belonging to sockets in FIN_WAIT2 or TIME_WAIT state
were being dropped by the packet filter.
