ACPI, APEI, GHES, printk support for recoverable error via NMI

Some APEI GHES recoverable errors are reported via NMI, but printk is
not safe in NMI context.

To solve the issue, a lock-less memory allocator is used to allocate
memory in NMI handler, save the error record into the allocated
memory, put the error record into a lock-less list.  On the other
hand, an irq_work is used to delay the operation from NMI context to
IRQ context.  The irq_work IRQ handler will remove nodes from
lock-less list, printk the error record and do some further processing
include recovery operation, then free the memory.
