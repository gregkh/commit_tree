Bluetooth: Add support for using the crypto subsystem

This will allow using the crypto subsystem for encrypting data. As SMP
(Security Manager Protocol) is implemented almost entirely on the host
side and the crypto module already implements the needed methods
(AES-128), it makes sense to use it.

There's now a new module option to enable/disable SMP support.
