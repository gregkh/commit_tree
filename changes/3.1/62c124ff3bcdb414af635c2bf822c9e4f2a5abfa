ptrace: use bit_waitqueue for TRAPPING instead of wait_chldexit

ptracer->signal->wait_chldexit was used to wait for TRAPPING; however,
->wait_chldexit was already complicated with waker-side filtering
without adding TRAPPING wait on top of it.  Also, it unnecessarily
made TRAPPING clearing depend on the current ptrace relationship - if
the ptracee is detached, wakeup is lost.

There is no reason to use signal->wait_chldexit here.  We're just
waiting for JOBCTL_TRAPPING bit to clear and given the relatively
infrequent use of ptrace, bit_waitqueue can serve it perfectly.

This patch makes JOBCTL_TRAPPING wait use bit_waitqueue instead of
signal->wait_chldexit.

-v2: Use JOBCTL_*_BIT macros instead of ilog2() as suggested by Linus.
