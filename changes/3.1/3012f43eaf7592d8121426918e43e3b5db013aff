ASoC: davinci: fix codec start and stop functions

According to DM365 voice codec data sheet at [1], before starting
recording or playback, ADC/DAC modules should follow a reset and
enable cycle. Writing a 1 to the ADC/DAC bit in the register resets
the module and clearing the bit to 0 will enable the module. But the
driver seems to be doing the reverse of it.
