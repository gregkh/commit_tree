target: Fix SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE zero LBA + range breakage

This patch fixes a SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE CDB handling bug with IBLOCK/FILEIO
backends where transport_cmd_get_valid_sectors() was incorrectly rejecting
a zero LBA + range CDB from being processed, and returning CHECK_CONDITION.

This includes changing transport_cmd_get_valid_sectors() to return '0' on
success and '-EINVAL' on failure (this makes more sense than sectors),
and to only check transport_cmd_get_valid_sectors() when a non zero LBA +
range SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE operation has been receieved for the non passthrough
case.
