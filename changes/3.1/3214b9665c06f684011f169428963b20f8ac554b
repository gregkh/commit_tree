ALSA: hda - Implement dynamic loopback control for VIA codecs

This patch adds the dynamic control of analog-loopback for VIA codecs.

When the loopback is enabled, the inputs from line-ins and mics are
mixed with the front DAC, and sent to the front outputs.  The very same
input is routed to the headhpones and speakers in loopback mode.
However, since the loopback mix can't take other than the front DAC,
there is no longer individual volume controls for headphones and
speakers.  Once when the loopback control is off, these volumes take
effect.

Since the individual volumes are more desired in general use caess, the
loopback mode is set to off as default for now.
