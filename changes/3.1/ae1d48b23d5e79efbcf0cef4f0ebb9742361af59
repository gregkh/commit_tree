ip_vs_mutext is used by both netns shutdown code and startup
and both implicit uses sk_lock-AF_INET mutex.

cleanup CPU-1         startup CPU-2
ip_vs_dst_event()     ip_vs_genl_set_cmd()
 sk_lock-AF_INET     __ip_vs_mutex
                     sk_lock-AF_INET
__ip_vs_mutex
* DEAD LOCK *

A new mutex placed in ip_vs netns struct called sync_mutex is added.

Comments from Julian and Simon added.
This patch has been running for more than 3 month now and it seems to work.

Ver. 3
    IP_VS_SO_GET_DAEMON in do_ip_vs_get_ctl protected by sync_mutex
    instead of __ip_vs_mutex as sugested by Julian.
