xfs: optimize the negative xattr caching

Since the addition of file capabilities every write needs to read xattrs to
check if we have any capabilities to clear.  In Linux 3.0 Andi Kleen added
a flag to cache the fact that we do not have any attributes on an inode.
Make sure to already mark a file as not having any attributes when reading
it from disk in case it doesn't even have an attribute fork.  Based on an
earlier patch from Andi Kleen.
