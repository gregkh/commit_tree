cfq-iosched: fix locking around ioc->ioc_data assignment

Since we are modifying this RCU pointer, we need to hold
the lock protecting it around it.

This fixes a potential reuse and double free of a cfq
io_context structure. The bug has been in CFQ for a long
time, it hit very few people but those it did hit seemed
to see it a lot.

Tracked in RH bugzilla here:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=577968

Credit goes to Paul Bolle for figuring out that the issue
was around the one-hit ioc->ioc_data cache. Thanks to his
hard work the issue is now fixed.
