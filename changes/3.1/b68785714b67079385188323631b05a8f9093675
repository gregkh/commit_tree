ALSA: hda - Add Realtek ALC269VC codec support

Add the support of ALC269VC codec.
Also delete the unnecessary codec_variant type enum list:
now only three variants (ALC269VA ALC269VB ALC269VC) are needed.

In addition, added some aliases:
 - Add ALC269VB alias name ALC277
 - Add ALC269VC alias name ALC259 ALC281X
 - Add ALC269VC for Lenovo device 0x21f3 name ALC3202
