powerpc: Set up LPCR for running guest partitions

In hypervisor mode, the LPCR controls several aspects of guest
partitions, including virtual partition memory mode, and also controls
whether the hypervisor decrementer interrupts are enabled.  This sets
up LPCR at boot time so that guest partitions will use a virtual real
memory area (VRMA) composed of 16MB large pages, and hypervisor
decrementer interrupts are disabled.
