ARM: pm: convert cpu_suspend() to a normal function

cpu_suspend() has a weird calling method which makes it only possible to
call from assembly code: it returns with a modified stack pointer to
finish the suspend, but on resume, it 'returns' via a provided pointer.

We can make cpu_suspend() appear to be a normal function merely by
swapping the resume pointer argument and the link register.

Do so, and update all callers to take account of this more traditional
behaviour.
