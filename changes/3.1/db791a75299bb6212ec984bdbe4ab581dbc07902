I2C: OMAP2+: Tag all OMAP2+ hwmod defintions with I2C IP revision

Since we cannot trust (or even reliably find) the OMAP I2C
peripheral unit's own revision register, we must inform the
OMAP i2c driver of which IP version it is running on.  We
do this by tagging the omap_hwmod_class for i2c on all the
OMAP2+ platform / cpu specific hwmod init and passing it up
to the driver (next patches).
