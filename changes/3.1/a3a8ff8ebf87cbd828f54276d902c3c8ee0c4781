KVM: nVMX: Move host-state field setup to a function

Move the setting of constant host-state fields (fields that do not change
throughout the life of the guest) from vmx_vcpu_setup to a new common function
vmx_set_constant_host_state(). This function will also be used to set the
host state when running L2 guests.
