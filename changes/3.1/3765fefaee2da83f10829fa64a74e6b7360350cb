btrfs: fix d_off in the first dirent

Since the d_off in the first dirent for "." (that originates from
the 4th argument "offset" of filldir() for the 2nd dirent for "..")
is wrongly assigned in btrfs_real_readdir(), telldir returns same
offset for different locations.

 | # mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb1
 | # mount /dev/sdb1 fs0
 | # cd fs0
 | # touch file0 file1
 | # ../test
 | telldir: 0
 | readdir: d_off = 2, d_name = "."
 | telldir: 2
 | readdir: d_off = 2, d_name = ".."
 | telldir: 2
 | readdir: d_off = 3, d_name = "file0"
 | telldir: 3
 | readdir: d_off = 2147483647, d_name = "file1"
 | telldir: 2147483647

To fix this problem, pass filp->f_pos (which is loff_t) instead.

 | # ../test
 | telldir: 0
 | readdir: d_off = 1, d_name = "."
 | telldir: 1
 | readdir: d_off = 2, d_name = ".."
 | telldir: 2
 | readdir: d_off = 3, d_name = "file0"
 :

At the moment the "offset" for "." is unused because there is no
preceding dirent, however it is better to pass filp->f_pos to follow
grammatical usage.
