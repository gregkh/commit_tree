pci: Don't crash when reading mpss from root complex

In pcie_find_smpss(), we have the following statement:

 	if (dev->is_hotplug_bridge && (!list_is_singular(&dev->bus->devices) ||
	    dev->bus->self->pcie_type != PCI_EXP_TYPE_ROOT_PORT))

The problem is that at least on my machine, this gets called for the
root complex (virtual P2P bridge), and dev->bus->self is NULL since
the parent bus for this is not itself anchor to a PCI device.

This adds the necessary NULL check.
