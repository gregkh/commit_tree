powerpc/kdump: Fix timeout in crash_kexec_wait_realmode

The existing code it pretty ugly.  How about we clean it up even more
like this?

From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>

We check for timeout expiry in the outer loop, but we also need to
check it in the inner loop or we can lock up forever waiting for a
CPU to hit real mode.
