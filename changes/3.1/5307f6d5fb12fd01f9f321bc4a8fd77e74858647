Fix pointer dereference before call to pcie_bus_configure_settings

Commit b03e7495a862 ("PCI: Set PCI-E Max Payload Size on fabric")
introduced a potential NULL pointer dereference in calls to
pcie_bus_configure_settings due to attempts to access pci_bus self
variables when the self pointer is NULL.

To correct this, verify that the self pointer in pci_bus is non-NULL
before dereferencing it.
