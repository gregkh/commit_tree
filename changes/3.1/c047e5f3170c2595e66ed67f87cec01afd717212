vhost-net: update used ring on backend change

On backend change, we flushed out outstanding skbs
but forgot to update the used ring, so that
done entries were left in the ubuf_info ring.
As a result we lose heads or complete incorrect ones,
crashing the guest or leaking memory.
Fix by updating the used ring.
