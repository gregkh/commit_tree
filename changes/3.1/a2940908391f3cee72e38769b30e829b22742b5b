efivars: String functions

Fix the string functions in the efivars driver to be called utf16_*
instead of utf8_* as the encoding is utf16, not utf8.

As well, rename utf16_strlen to utf16_strnlen as it takes a maxlength
argument and the name should be consistent with the standard C function
names.  utf16_strlen is still provided for convenience in a subsequent
patch.
