Revert "xfs: fix filesystsem freeze race in xfs_trans_alloc"

This reverts commit 7a249cf83da1813cfa71cfe1e265b40045eceb47.

That commit created a situation that could lead to a filesystem
hang.  As Dave Chinner pointed out, xfs_trans_alloc() could hold a
reference to m_active_trans (i.e., keep it non-zero) and then wait
for SB_FREEZE_TRANS to complete.  Meanwhile a filesystem freeze
request could set SB_FREEZE_TRANS and then wait for m_active_trans
to drop to zero.  Nobody benefits from this sequence of events...
