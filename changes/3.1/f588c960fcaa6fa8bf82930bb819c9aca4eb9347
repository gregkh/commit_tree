hfsplus: Fix kfree of wrong pointers in hfsplus_fill_super() error path

Commit 6596528e391a ("hfsplus: ensure bio requests are not smaller than
the hardware sectors") changed the pointers used for volume header
allocations but failed to free the correct pointers in the error path
path of hfsplus_fill_super() and hfsplus_read_wrapper.

The second hunk came from a separate patch by Pavel Ivanov.
