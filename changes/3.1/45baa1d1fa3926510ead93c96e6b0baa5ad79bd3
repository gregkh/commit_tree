tpm_tis: Re-enable interrupts upon (S3) resume

This patch makes sure that if the TPM TIS interface is run in interrupt mode
(rather than polling mode) that all interrupts are enabled in the TPM's
interrupt enable register after a resume from ACPI S3 suspend. The registers
may either have been cleared by the TPM loosing its state during device sleep
or by the BIOS leaving the TPM in polling mode (after sending a command to
the TPM for starting it up again)

You may want to check if your TPM runs with interrupts by doing

cat /proc/interrupts | grep -i tpm

and see whether there is an entry or otherwise for it to use interrupts:

modprobe tpm_tis interrupts=1 [add 'itpm=1' for Intel TPM ]

v2:
  - the patch was adapted to work with the pnp and platform driver
    implementations in tpm_tis.c
