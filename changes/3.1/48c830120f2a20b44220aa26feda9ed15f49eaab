net: copy userspace buffers on device forwarding

dev_forward_skb loops an skb back into host networking
stack which might hang on the memory indefinitely.
In particular, this can happen in macvtap in bridged mode.
Copy the userspace fragments to avoid blocking the
sender in that case.

As this patch makes skb_copy_ubufs extern now,
I also added some documentation and made it clear
the SKBTX_DEV_ZEROCOPY flag automatically instead
of doing it in all callers. This can be made into a separate
patch if people feel it's worth it.
