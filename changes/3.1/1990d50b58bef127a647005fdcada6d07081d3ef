[media] Stop using linux/version.h on most video drivers

All the modified drivers didn't have any version increment since
Jan, 1 2011. Several of them didn't have any version increment
for a long time, even having new features and important bug fixes
happening.

As we're now filling the QUERYCAP version with the current Kernel
Release, we don't need to maintain a per-driver version control
anymore. So, let's just use the default.

In order to preserve the Kernel module version history, a
KERNEL_VERSION() macro were added to all modified drivers, and
the extraver number were incremented.

I opted to preserve the per-driver version control to a few
pwc, pvrusb2, s2255, s5p-fimc and sh_vou.

A few drivers are still using the legacy way to handle ioctl's.
So, we can't do such change on them, otherwise, they'll break.
Those are: uvc, et61x251 and sn9c102.

The rationale is that the per-driver version control seems to be
actively maintained on those.

Yet, I think that the better for them would be to just use the
default version numbering, instead of doing that by themselves.

While here, removed a few uneeded include linux/version.h
