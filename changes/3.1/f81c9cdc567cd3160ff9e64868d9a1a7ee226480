Btrfs: truncate pages from clone ioctl target range

We need to truncate page cache pages for the clone ioctl target range or
else we'll confuse ourselves to no end.  If the old data was cached, we
used to still see it (until remount).  If the page was partially updated
we used to get a mix of old and new data.
