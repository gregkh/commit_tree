TPM: TCG_ATMEL should depend on HAS_IOPORT

On m68k, I get:

drivers/char/tpm/tpm_atmel.h: In function ‘atmel_get_base_addr’:
drivers/char/tpm/tpm_atmel.h:129: error: implicit declaration of function ‘ioport_map’
drivers/char/tpm/tpm_atmel.h:129: warning: return makes pointer from integer without a cast

The code in tpm_atmel.h supports PPC64 (using the device tree and ioremap())
and "anything else" (using ioport_map()). However, ioportmap() is only
available on platforms that set HAS_IOPORT.

Although PC64 seems to have HAS_IOPORT, a "depends on HAS_IOPORT" should work,
but I think it's better to expose the special PPC64 handling explicit using
"depends on PPC64 || HAS_IOPORT".
