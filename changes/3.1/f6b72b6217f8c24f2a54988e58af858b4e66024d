net: Embed hh_cache inside of struct neighbour.

Now that there is a one-to-one correspondance between neighbour
and hh_cache entries, we no longer need:

1) dynamic allocation
2) attachment to dst->hh
3) refcounting

Initialization of the hh_cache entry is indicated by hh_len
being non-zero, and such initialization is always done with
the neighbour's lock held as a writer.
