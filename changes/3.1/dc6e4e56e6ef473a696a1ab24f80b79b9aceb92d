PM: subsys_data in struct dev_pm_info need not depend on RM_RUNTIME

The subsys_data field of struct dev_pm_info, introduced by commit
1d2b71f61b6a10216274e27b717becf9ae101fc7 (PM / Runtime: Add subsystem
data field to struct dev_pm_info), is going to be used even if
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is not set, so move it from under the #ifdef.
