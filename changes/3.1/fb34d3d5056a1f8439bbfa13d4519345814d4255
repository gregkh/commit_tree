ASoC: twl6040: Convert into TWL6040 MFD child

Convert TWL6040 CODEC driver into a TWL6040 MFD child, it implies
that MFD-level operations like register accesses, clock setting
and power management are done through MFD APIs, not directly by
CODEC driver anymore. To avoid conflicts with the other MFD child,
vibrator registers are skipped in CODEC driver.
