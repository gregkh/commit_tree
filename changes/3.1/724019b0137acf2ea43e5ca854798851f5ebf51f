OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix smart-standby + wakeup support

The commit 86009eb326afde34ffdc5648cd344aa86b8d58d4 was adding
the wakeup support for new OMAP4 IPs. This support is incomplete for
busmaster IPs that need as well to use smart-standby with wakeup.

This new standbymode is suported on HSI and USB_HOST_FS for the moment.

Add the new MSTANDBY_SMART_WKUP flag to mark the IPs that support this
capability.

Enable this new mode when applicable in _enable_wakeup, _disable_wakeup,
_enable_sysc and _idle_sysc.

The omap_hwmod_44xx_data.c will have to be updated to add this new flag.
