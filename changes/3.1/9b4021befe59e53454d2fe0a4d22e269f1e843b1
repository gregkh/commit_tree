OMAP4: hwmod data: Fix L3 interconnect data order and alignement

Change the position of the ocp_if structure to match the template.

Remove unneeded comma at the end of address space flag field.

Remove USER_SDMA since this ocp link is only from the l3_main_1
path that is accessible only from the MPU in that case and not
the SDMA.
