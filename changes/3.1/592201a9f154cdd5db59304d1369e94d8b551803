ARM: Thumb-2: Support Thumb-2 in undefined instruction handler

This patch allows undef_hook's to be specified for 32-bit Thumb
instructions and also to be used for thumb kernel-side code.

32-bit Thumb instructions are specified in the form:
	((first_half << 16 ) | second_half)
which matches the layout used by the ARM ARM.

ptrace was handling 32-bit Thumb instructions by hooking the first
halfword and manually checking the second half. This method would be
broken by this patch so it is migrated to make use of the new Thumb-2
support.
