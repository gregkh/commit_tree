memcg: Revert "memcg: add memory.vmscan_stat"

Revert the post-3.0 commit 82f9d486e59f5 ("memcg: add
memory.vmscan_stat").

The implementation of per-memcg reclaim statistics violates how memcg
hierarchies usually behave: hierarchically.

The reclaim statistics are accounted to child memcgs and the parent
hitting the limit, but not to hierarchy levels in between.  Usually,
hierarchical statistics are perfectly recursive, with each level
representing the sum of itself and all its children.

Since this exports statistics to userspace, this may lead to confusion
and problems with changing things after the release, so revert it now,
we can try again later.
