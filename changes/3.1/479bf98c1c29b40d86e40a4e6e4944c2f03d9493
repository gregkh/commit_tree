ptrace: wait_consider_task: s/same_thread_group/ptrace_reparented/

wait_consider_task() checks same_thread_group(parent, real_parent),
this is the open-coded ptrace_reparented().

__ptrace_detach() remains the only function which has to check this by
hand, although we could reorganize the code to delay __ptrace_unlink.
