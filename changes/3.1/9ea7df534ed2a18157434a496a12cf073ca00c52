ext4: Rewrite ext4_page_mkwrite() to use generic helpers

Rewrite ext4_page_mkwrite() to use __block_page_mkwrite() helper. This
removes the need of using i_alloc_sem to avoid races with truncate which
seems to be the wrong locking order according to lock ordering documented in
mm/rmap.c. Also calling ext4_da_write_begin() as used by the old code seems to
be problematic because we can decide to flush delay-allocated blocks which
will acquire s_umount semaphore - again creating unpleasant lock dependency
if not directly a deadlock.

Also add a check for frozen filesystem so that we don't busyloop in page fault
when the filesystem is frozen.
