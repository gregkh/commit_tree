writeback: account NR_WRITTEN at IO completion time

NR_WRITTEN is now accounted at block IO enqueue time, which is not very
accurate as to common understanding.  This moves NR_WRITTEN accounting to
the IO completion time and makes it more consistent with BDI_WRITTEN,
which is used for bandwidth estimation.
