I2C: OMAP2+: Set hwmod flags to only allow 16-bit accesses to i2c

Peter Maydell noticed when running under QEMU he was getting
errors reporting 32-bit access to I2C peripheral unit registers
that are documented to be 8 or 16-bit only[1][2]

The I2C driver is blameless as it wraps its accesses in a
function using __raw_writew and __raw_readw, it turned out it
is the hwmod stuff.

However the hwmod code already has a flag to force a
perhipheral unit to only be accessed using 16-bit operations.

This patch applies the 16-bit only flag to the 2430,
OMAP3xxx and OMAP44xx hwmod structs.  2420 was already
correctly marked up as 16-bit.

The 2430 change will need testing by TI as arranged
in the comments to the previous patch version.

When the 16-bit flag is or-ed with other flags, it is placed
first as requested in comments.
