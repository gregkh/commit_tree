staging: usbip: userspace tools v1.0.0

The new and improved (well somewhat, with a ways to go) userspace utility.

    mfm:pts/8[~/tmp/userspace]
    May26 05:18:31 % ./src/usbip help
    usage: usbip [--debug] [version]
                 [help] <command> <args>

      attach     Attach a remote USB device
      detach     Detach a remote USB device
      list       List exported or local USB devices
      bind       Bind device to usbip-host.ko
      unbind     Unbind device from usbip-host.ko

This first commit of the userspace `usbip' utility uses to same
implementation as the old tools, `usbip' and  `usbip_bind_driver'.
Nothing significant has changed so compatibility with windows has
_not_ been broken. However, the tools remain broken in many ways
due to the old implementation.
