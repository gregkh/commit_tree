ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix auto-mute with HP+LO configuration

When the system has only the headphone and the line-out jacks without
speakers, the current auto-mute code doesn't work.  It's because the
spec->automute_lines flag is wrongly referred in update_speakers().
This flag must be meaningless when spec->automute_hp_lo isn't set, thus
they should be always coupled.

The patch fixes the problem and add a comment to indicate the
relationship briefly.
