drm/i915: load a ring frequency scaling table v3

The ring frequency scaling table tells the PCU to treat certain GPU
frequencies as if they were a given CPU frequency for purposes of
scaling the ring frequency.  Normally the PCU will scale the ring
frequency based on the CPU P-state, but with the table present, it will
also take the GPU frequency into account.

The main downside of keeping the ring frequency high while the CPU is
at a low frequency (or asleep altogether) is increased power
consumption.  But then if you're keeping your GPU busy, you probably
want the extra performance.

v2:
  - add units to debug table header (from Eric)
  - use tsc_khz as a fallback if the cpufreq driver doesn't give us a freq
    (from Chris)
v3:
  - fix comments & debug output
  - remove unneeded force wake get/put
