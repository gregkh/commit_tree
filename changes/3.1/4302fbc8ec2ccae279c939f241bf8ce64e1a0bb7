panic: panic=-1 for immediate reboot

When a kernel BUG or oops occurs, ChromeOS intends to panic and
immediately reboot, with stacktrace and other messages preserved in RAM
across reboot.

But the longer we delay, the more likely the user is to poweroff and
lose the info.

panic_timeout (seconds before rebooting) is set by panic= boot option or
sysctl or /proc/sys/kernel/panic; but 0 means wait forever, so at
present we have to delay at least 1 second.

Let a negative number mean reboot immediately (with the small cosmetic
benefit of suppressing that newline-less "Rebooting in %d seconds.."
message).
