ALSA: hda - Re-add need_dac_fix check for multi-io jacks of Realtek codecs

During the rewrite, the check of spec->need_dac_fix and the corresponding
num_dacs change was dropped from the channel-mode control.

This patch re-adds it, and also enables need_dac_fix for ALC880 as default,
as this feature was originally introduced to fix h/w bugs of this chip.
