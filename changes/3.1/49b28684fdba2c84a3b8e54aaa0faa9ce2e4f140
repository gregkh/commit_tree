nfsd: Remove deprecated nfsctl system call and related code.

As promised in feature-removal-schedule.txt it is time to
remove the nfsctl system call.

Userspace has perferred to not use this call throughout 2.6 and it has been
excluded in the default configuration since 2.6.36 (9 months ago).

So this patch removes all the code that was being compiled out.

There are still references to sys_nfsctl in various arch systemcall tables
and related code.  These should be cleaned out too, probably in the next
merge window.
