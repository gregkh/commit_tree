xen: disable PV spinlocks on HVM

PV spinlocks cannot possibly work with the current code because they are
enabled after pvops patching has already been done, and because PV
spinlocks use a different data structure than native spinlocks so we
cannot switch between them dynamically. A spinlock that has been taken
once by the native code (__ticket_spin_lock) cannot be taken by
__xen_spin_lock even after it has been released.
