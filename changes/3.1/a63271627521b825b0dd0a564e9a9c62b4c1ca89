Do blk_flush_plug_list() first and then add new request aDo blk_flush_plug_list() first and then add new request aDo blk_flush_plug_list() first and then add new request at the tail. New
request can't be merged to existing requests, but later new requests might
be merged with this new one. If blk_flush_plug_list() is done later, the
merge doesn't happen.
