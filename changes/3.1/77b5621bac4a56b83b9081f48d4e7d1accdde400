rt2x00: Don't use queue entry as parameter when creating TX descriptor.

The functions that create the tx descriptor structure do not operate on
a queue entry at all. Signal this fact in the code by not providing a
queue entry as a parameter, but the rt2x00 device structure and the skb
directly.

This patch is a preparation for reducing the time a queue is locked for
a tx operation.
