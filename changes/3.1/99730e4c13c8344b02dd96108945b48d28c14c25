e1000e: 82579 intermittently disabled during S0->Sx

When repeatedly cycling Sx->S0 states with the network cable unplugged,
the 82579 PHY may not initialize as expected and may require a full power
cycle to recover functionality to the device.  Workaround this by testing
access of the PHY registers after resuming; if that returns unexpected
results toggle the LANPHYPC signal to power cycle the PHY.

This is implemented in the new function e1000_resume_workarounds_pchlan()
which calls another new function, e1000_toggle_lanphypc_value_ich8lan(),
which has been created to reduce code duplication (same functionality
required by a previous workaround).  Also, e1000e_disable_gig_wol_ich8lan
is now e1000_suspend_workarounds_ich8lan to better reflect what it does.
