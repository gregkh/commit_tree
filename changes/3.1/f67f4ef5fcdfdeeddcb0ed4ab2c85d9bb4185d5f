powerpc/book3e-64: use a separate TLB handler when linear map is bolted

On MMUs such as FSL where we can guarantee the entire linear mapping is
bolted, we don't need to worry about linear TLB misses.  If on top of
that we do a full table walk, we get rid of all recursive TLB faults, and
can dispense with some state saving.  This gains a few percent on
TLB-miss-heavy workloads, and around 50% on a benchmark that had a high
rate of virtual page table faults under the normal handler.

While touching the EX_TLB layout, remove EX_TLB_MMUCR0, EX_TLB_SRR0, and
EX_TLB_SRR1 as they're not used.
