Btrfs: use the normal checksumming infrastructure for free space cache

We used to store the checksums of the space cache directly in the space cache,
however that doesn't work out too well if we have more space than we can fit the
checksums into the first page.  So instead use the normal checksumming
infrastructure.  There were problems with doing this originally but those
problems don't exist now so this works out fine.  Thanks,
