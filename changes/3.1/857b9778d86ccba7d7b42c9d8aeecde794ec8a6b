xfs: kill xfs_itruncate_start

xfs_itruncate_start is a rather length wrapper that evaluates to a call
to xfs_ioend_wait and xfs_tosspages, and only has two callers.

Instead of using the complicated checks left over from IRIX where we
can to truncate the pagecache just call xfs_tosspages
(aka truncate_inode_pages) directly as we want to get rid of all data
after i_size, and truncate_inode_pages handles incorrect alignments
and too large offsets just fine.
