KVM: nVMX: Allow setting the VMXE bit in CR4

This patch allows the guest to enable the VMXE bit in CR4, which is a
prerequisite to running VMXON.

Whether to allow setting the VMXE bit now depends on the architecture (svm
or vmx), so its checking has moved to kvm_x86_ops->set_cr4(). This function
now returns an int: If kvm_x86_ops->set_cr4() returns 1, __kvm_set_cr4()
will also return 1, and this will cause kvm_set_cr4() will throw a #GP.

Turning on the VMXE bit is allowed only when the nested VMX feature is
enabled, and turning it off is forbidden after a vmxon.
