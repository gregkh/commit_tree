rtnetlink: Compute and store minimum ifinfo dump size

The message size allocated for rtnl ifinfo dumps was limited to
a single page.  This is not enough for additional interface info
available with devices that support SR-IOV and caused a bug in
which VF info would not be displayed if more than approximately
40 VFs were created per interface.

Implement a new function pointer for the rtnl_register service that will
calculate the amount of data required for the ifinfo dump and allocate
enough data to satisfy the request.
