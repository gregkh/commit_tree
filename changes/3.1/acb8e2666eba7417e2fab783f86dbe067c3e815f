ASoC: davinci-pcm: increase the maximum channels

Based on the registration of davinci-mcasp.1 in the davinci-evm platform
setup for da830 and dm6467, davinci-pcm can handle more than the currently
reported maximum channels of 2.

Increase the maximum channels to 384 to match the maximum reported by
davinci-mcasp.1.
