ALSA: hda - Expose secret DAC-AA connection of some VIA codecs

VT1718S and co have a secret connection from DAC to AA-mix, which
doesn't appear in the connection list obtained from the h/w.
Currently the driver fixes the connection index locally at init, but
now we can expose it statically via snd_hda_override_connections()
so that this conection can be checked better by the parser in future.
