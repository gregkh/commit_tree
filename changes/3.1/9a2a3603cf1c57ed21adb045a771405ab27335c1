OMAP4: powerdomain data: Fix core mem states and missing cefuse flag

Since ES2.0, the core ocmram does not support a different state
than the main power domain anymore during both ON and RET power
domain state.
Since PM is not supported at all in ES1.0, update the common
structure.

LOWPOWERSTATECHANGE is supported by the cefuse power domain but
the flag was missing.
Add the PWRDM_HAS_LOWPOWERSTATECHANGE in flags field.

Update the TI copyright date to 2011.
