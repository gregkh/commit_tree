sh: Fix boot crash related to SCI

Commit d006199e72a9 ("serial: sh-sci: Regtype probing doesn't need to be
fatal.") made sci_init_single() return when sci_probe_regmap() succeeds,
although it should return when sci_probe_regmap() fails.  This causes
systems using the serial sh-sci driver to crash during boot.

Fix the problem by using the right return condition.
