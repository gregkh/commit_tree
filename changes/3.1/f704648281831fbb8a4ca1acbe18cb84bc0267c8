staging:rts_pstor: fix thread synchronization flow

Using different completion variables to synchronize different kernel threads

This patch fix a bug that may cause memory leak when driver
disconnected. This is not a very urgent bug. Because with the default
setting, driver disconnectting routine won't be called except when Linux
is shut down. But if the option auto_delink_en is set, a small number of
memory would leak out after memory card unplugged.
