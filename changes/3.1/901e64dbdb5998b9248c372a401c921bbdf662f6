HID: roccat: fix NULL pointer dereference, add range checks

On rare occassions raw events can be triggered before drvdata gets set up
which leads to NULL pointer dereferences. This was only observed with pyra on
2.6.39, but is fixed for all devices now to play it save.
kovaplus returned wrong actual values when profile change was initiated from host.
Added range checks for setting actual profile on all devices.
