perf evlist: Don't die if sample_{id_all|type} is invalid

Fixes two more cases where the python binding would not load:

. Not finding die(), which it shouldn't anyway, not good to just stop the
  world because some particular perf.data file is invalid, just propagate
  the error to the caller.

. Not finding perf_sample_size: fix it by moving it from event.c to evsel,
  where it belongs, as most cases are moving to operate on an evsel object.o

One of the fixed problems:

[root@emilia ~]# python
>>> import perf
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: /home/acme/git/build/perf/python/perf.so: undefined symbol: perf_sample_size
>>>
[root@emilia ~]#
