ALSA: use KBUILD_MODNAME for request_irq argument in sound/pci/*

The name argument of request_irq() appears in /proc/interrupts, and
it's quite ugly when the name entry contains a space or special letters.
In general, it's simpler and more readable when the module name appears
there, so let's replace all entries with KBUILD_MODNAME.
