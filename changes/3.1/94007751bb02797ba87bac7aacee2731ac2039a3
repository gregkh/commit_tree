Avoid dereferencing a 'request_queue' after last close.

On the last close of an 'md' device which as been stopped, the device
is destroyed and in particular the request_queue is freed.  The free
is done in a separate thread so it might happen a short time later.

__blkdev_put calls bdev_inode_switch_bdi *after* ->release has been
called.

Since commit f758eeabeb96f878c860e8f110f94ec8820822a9
bdev_inode_switch_bdi will dereference the 'old' bdi, which lives
inside a request_queue, to get a spin lock.  This causes the last
close on an md device to sometime take a spin_lock which lives in
freed memory - which results in an oops.

So move the called to bdev_inode_switch_bdi before the call to
->release.
