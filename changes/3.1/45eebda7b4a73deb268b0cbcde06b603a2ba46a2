ALSA: hda - Add support for vref-out based mute LED control on IDT codecs

This patch also registers all necessary callbacks to support mute LED
only when such control is enabled. And it keeps codec AFG in D0 or D1
state all the time when aggressive power managemnt is enabled for vref-out
control (and mute LED) work correctly.
