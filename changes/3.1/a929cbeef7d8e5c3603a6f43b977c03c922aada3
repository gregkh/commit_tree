crypto: omap-sham - replace flags operation with atomic bit operations

Some flags are changed in interrupt handlers and verified in the tasklet.
There might be a race condition when tasklet is interrupted or another
cpu/core will run IRQ handler and tasklet in parallel.
Atomic bitops functions are now used instead of bitmask operations.
