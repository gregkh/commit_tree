[S390] Add PSW restart shutdown trigger

With this patch a new S390 shutdown trigger "restart" is added. If under
z/VM "systerm restart" is entered or under the HMC the "PSW restart" button
is pressed, the PSW located at 0 (31 bit) or 0x1a0 (64 bit) bit is loaded.
Now we execute do_restart() that processes the restart action that is
defined under /sys/firmware/shutdown_actions/on_restart. Currently the
following actions are possible: reipl (default), stop, vmcmd, dump, and
dump_reipl.
