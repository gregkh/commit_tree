  ALSA: hda - Reduce static init verbs for Realtek auto-parsers

The input amps of mixer widgets should be unmuted as default (as
usually they have no assigned mixer switches).

More fixes in this commit are, however, for ALC260: ALC260 codec can
have multiple output mixers connnected to a single DAC althouh the
driver didn't pick up them properly.
