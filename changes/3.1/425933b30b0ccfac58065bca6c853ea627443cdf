MXC: iomux-v3: correct NO_PAD_CTRL definition

iomux-v3.c uses NO_PAD_CTRL as a 32 bit value
so it should not be shifted left by MUX_PAD_CTRL_SHIFT(41)

Previously, anything requesting NO_PAD_CTRL would get
their pad control register set to 0.

Since it is a pad control mask, place it with the other mask values.
