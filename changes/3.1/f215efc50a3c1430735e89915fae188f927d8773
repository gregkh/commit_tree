ftrace/recordmcount: mcount address adjustment

Introduce mcount_adjust{,_32,_64} to the C implementation of
recordmcount analog to $mcount_adjust in the perl script.
The adjustment is added to the address of the relocations
against the mcount symbol. If this adjustment is done by
recordmcount at compile time the ftrace_call_adjust function
can be turned into a nop.
