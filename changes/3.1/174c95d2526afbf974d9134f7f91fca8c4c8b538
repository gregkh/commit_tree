slcan: ldisc generated skbs are received in softirq context

As this discussion pointed out

http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=131257225602375

netdevices that are based on serial line disciplines should use netif_rx_ni()
when pushing received socketbuffers into the netdev rx queue.

Following commit 614851601c121b1320a35757ab88292d6272f906 ("slip: fix NOHZ
local_softirq_pending 08 warning") this patch updates the slcan driver
accordingly.
