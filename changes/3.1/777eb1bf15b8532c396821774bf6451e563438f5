block: Free queue resources at blk_release_queue()

A kernel crash is observed when a mounted ext3/ext4 filesystem is
physically removed. The problem is that blk_cleanup_queue() frees up
some resources eg by calling elevator_exit(), which are not checked for
in normal operation. So we should rather move these calls to the
destructor function blk_release_queue() as at that point all remaining
references are gone. However, in doing so we have to ensure that any
externally supplied queue_lock is disconnected as the driver might free
up the lock after the call of blk_cleanup_queue(),
