net: ibm_newemac: convert it to use of_get_phy_mode

The patch extends 'enum phy_interface_t' and of_get_phy_mode a little
bit with PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_NA and PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_SMII added,
and then converts ibm_newemac net driver to use of_get_phy_mode
getting phy mode from device tree.

It also resolves the namespace conflict on phy_read/write between
common mdiobus interface and ibm_newemac private one.
