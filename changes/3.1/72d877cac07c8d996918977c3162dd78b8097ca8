[media] v4l2-ctrls: add v4l2_ctrl_auto_cluster to simplify autogain/gain scenarios

It is a bit tricky to handle autogain/gain type scenerios correctly. Such
controls need to be clustered and the V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_UPDATE should be set on
the autofoo controls. In addition, the manual controls should be marked
inactive when the automatic mode is on, and active when the manual mode is on.
This also requires specialized volatile handling.

The chances of drivers doing all these things correctly are pretty remote.
So a new v4l2_ctrl_auto_cluster function was added that takes care of these
issues.
