dm table: set flush capability based on underlying devices

DM has always advertised both REQ_FLUSH and REQ_FUA flush capabilities
regardless of whether or not a given DM device's underlying devices
also advertised a need for them.

Block's flush-merge changes from 2.6.39 have proven to be more costly
for DM devices.  Performance regressions have been reported even when
DM's underlying devices do not advertise that they have a write cache.

Fix the performance regressions by configuring a DM device's flushing
capabilities based on those of the underlying devices' capabilities.
