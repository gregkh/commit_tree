target: More core cleanups from AGrover (round 2)

This patch contains the squashed version of second round of target core
cleanups and simplifications and Andy and Co.   It also contains a handful
of fixes to address bugs the original series and other minor cleanups.

Here is the condensed shortlog:

target: Remove unneeded casts to void*
target: Rename get_lun_for_{cmd,tmr} to lookup_{cmd,tmr}_lun
target: Make t_task a member of se_cmd, not a pointer
target: Handle functions returning "-2"
target: Use cmd->se_dev over cmd->se_lun->lun_se_dev
target: Embed qr in struct se_cmd
target: Replace embedded struct se_queue_req with a list_head
target: Rename list_heads that are nodes in struct se_cmd to "*_node"
target: Fold transport_device_setup_cmd() into lookup_{tmr,cmd}_lun()
target: Make t_mem_list and t_mem_list_bidi members of t_task
target: Add comment & cleanup transport_map_sg_to_mem()
target: Remove unneeded checks in transport_free_pages()

(Roland: Fix se_queue_req removal leftovers OOPs)
(nab: Fix transport_lookup_tmr_lun failure case)
(nab: Fix list_empty(&cmd->t_task.t_mem_bidi_list) inversion bugs)
