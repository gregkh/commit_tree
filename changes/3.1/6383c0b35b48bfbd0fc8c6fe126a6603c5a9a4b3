bnx2x: Multiple concurrent l2 traffic classes

Overview:
 Support mapping of priorities to traffic classes and
 traffic classes to transmission queues ranges in the net device.
 The queue ranges are (count, offset) pairs relating to the txq
 array.
 This can be done via DCBX negotiation or by kernel.
 As a result Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS) and Priority Flow
 Control (PFC) are supported between L2 network traffic classes.

 Mapping:
 This patch uses the netdev_set_num_tc, netdev_set_prio_tc_map and
 netdev_set_tc_queue functions to map priorities to traffic classes
 and traffic classes to transmission queue ranges.
 This mapping is performed by bnx2x_setup_tc function which is
 connected to the ndo_setup_tc.
 This function is always called at nic load where by default it
 maps all priorities to tc 0, and it may also be called by the
 kernel or by the bnx2x upon DCBX negotiation to modify the mapping.

 rtnl lock:
 When the ndo_setup_tc is called at nic load or by kernel the rtnl
 lock is already taken. However, when DCBX negotiation takes place
 the lock is not taken. The work is therefore scheduled to be
 handled by the sp_rtnl task.

 Fastpath:
 The fastpath structure of the bnx2x which was previously used
 to hold the information of one tx queue and one rx queue was
 redesigned to represent multiple tx queues, one for each traffic
 class.
 The transmission queue supplied in the skb by the kernel can no
 longer be interpreted as a straightforward index into the fastpath
 structure array, but it must rather be decoded to the appropriate
 fastpath index and the tc within that fastpath.

 Slowpath:
 The bnx2x's queue object was redesigned to accommodate multiple
 transmission queues. The queue object's state machine was enhanced
 to allow opening multiple transmission-only connections on top of
 the regular tx-rx connection.

 Firmware:
 This feature relies on the tx-only queue feature introduced in the
 bnx2x 7.0.23 firmware and the FW likewise must have the bnx2x multi
 cos support.
