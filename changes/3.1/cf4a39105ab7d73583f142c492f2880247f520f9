ASoC: Remove internally generated WM8915 supplies

DCVDD and MICVDD are intended to be (and almost always are) generated by
on-board LDOs which are transparently controlled by the driver so we
shouldn't really be requesting them from the regulator API. If the driver
is updated to support external supply of these then we will need to change
the way we handle this.
