treewide: fix potentially dangerous trailing ';' in #defined values/expressions

All these are instances of
  #define NAME value;
or
  #define NAME(params_opt) value;

These of course fail to build when used in contexts like
  if(foo $OP NAME)
  while(bar $OP NAME)
and may silently generate the wrong code in contexts such as
  foo = NAME + 1;    /* foo = value; + 1; */
  bar = NAME - 1;    /* bar = value; - 1; */
  baz = NAME & quux; /* baz = value; & quux; */

Initial analysis of the dangers provided by Keith Thompson in that thread.

There are many more instances of more complicated macros having unnecessary
trailing semicolons, but this pile seems to be all of the cases of simple
values suffering from the problem. (Thus things that are likely to be found
in one of the contexts above, more complicated ones aren't.)
