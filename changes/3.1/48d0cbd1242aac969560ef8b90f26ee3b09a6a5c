ceph: handle racing calls to ceph_init_dentry

The ->lookup() and prepopulate_readdir() callers are working with unhashed
dentries, so we don't have to worry.  The export.c callers, though, need
to initialize something they got back from d_obtain_alias() and are
potentially racing with other callers.  Make sure we don't return unless
the dentry is properly initialized (by us or someone else).
