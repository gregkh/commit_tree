perf tools: Allow sort dimensions to be registered more than once

So that the parent sort dimension can be registered twice: once
if we add it as an explicit sort dimension (-s parent) and twice
if we request a parent filter (-p foo).

We'll have only one parent sort dimension in the end but this
allows to override the default parent filter with we gave in "-p"
option. The goal of this is to prepare to allow the use of
"-s parent" and "-p foo" at the same time, ie: sort by filtered
parent.
