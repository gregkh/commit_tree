rtnl: provide link dump consistency info

This patch adds a change sequence counter to each net namespace
which is bumped whenever a netdevice is added or removed from
the list. If such a change occurred while a link dump took place,
the dump will have the NLM_F_DUMP_INTR flag set in the first
message which has been interrupted and in all subsequent messages
of the same dump.

Note that links may still be modified or renamed while a dump is
taking place but we can guarantee for userspace to receive a
complete list of links and not miss any.

Testing:
I have added 500 VLAN netdevices to make sure the dump is split
over multiple messages. Then while continuously dumping links in
one process I also continuously deleted and re-added a dummy
netdevice in another process. Multiple dumps per seconds have
had the NLM_F_DUMP_INTR flag set.

I guess we can wait for Johannes patch to hit net-next via the
wireless tree.  I just wanted to give this some testing right away.
