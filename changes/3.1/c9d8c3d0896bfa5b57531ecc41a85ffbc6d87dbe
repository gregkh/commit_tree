mm/memblock.c: avoid abuse of RED_INACTIVE

inappropriate, because memblock is dealing with phys_addr_t's which have a
Kconfigurable sizeof().

Create a new poison type for this application.  Fixes the sparse warning

    warning: cast truncates bits from constant value (9f911029d74e35b becomes 9d74e35b)
