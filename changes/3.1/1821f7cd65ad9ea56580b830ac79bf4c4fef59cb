net: allow netif_carrier to be called safely from IRQ

As reported by Ben Greer and Froncois Romieu. The code path in
the netif_carrier code leads it to try and disable
a late workqueue to reenable it immediately
netif_carrier_on
-> linkwatch_fire_event
   -> linkwatch_schedule_work
      -> cancel_delayed_work
         -> del_timer_sync

If __cancel_delayed_work is used instead then there is no
problem of waiting for running linkwatch_event.

There is a race between linkwatch_event running re-scheduling
but it is harmless to schedule an extra scan of the linkwatch queue.
