ALSA: hda - Fix the silent front with independent-HP for VIA codecs

Unmute DAC on front speaker path when Independent HP is enabled.

When to enable Independent HP, the front speaker won't output any sound
for VT1708, VT1708B, VT1708S and VT1702.
I find the via_independent_hp_put() routine will mute DAC 0 path in Mixer 0.
For these codecs, when using Independent HP, there could have two
independent streams, one is from DAC0-->Mixer0-->Front Pin, the other is
from DAC3-->GainSW3-->Side Pin.
So I added a check for DAC-->Mixer path in activate_output_path().

If current path is DAC-->Mixer, no need to mute DAC index in Mixer.
In fact, to change connection of Headphone pin or Mux connected with HP
is enough.
