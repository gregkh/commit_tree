[S390] kvm: fix address mode switching

598841ca9919d008b520114d8a4378c4ce4e40a1 ([S390] use gmap address
spaces for kvm guest images) changed kvm to use a separate address
space for kvm guests. This address space was switched in __vcpu_run
In some cases (preemption, page fault) there is the possibility that
this address space switch is lost.
The typical symptom was a huge amount of validity intercepts or
random guest addressing exceptions.
Fix this by doing the switch in sie_loop and sie_exit and saving the
address space in the gmap structure itself. Also use the preempt
notifier.
