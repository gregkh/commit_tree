TOMOYO: Change pathname for non-rename()able filesystems.

TOMOYO wants to use /proc/self/ rather than /proc/$PID/ if $PID matches current
thread's process ID in order to prevent current thread from accessing other
process's information unless needed.

But since procfs can be mounted on various locations (e.g. /proc/ /proc2/ /p/
/tmp/foo/100/p/ ), TOMOYO cannot tell that whether the numeric part in the
string returned by __d_path() represents process ID or not.

Therefore, to be able to convert from $PID to self no matter where procfs is
mounted, this patch changes pathname representations for filesystems which do
not support rename() operation (e.g. proc, sysfs, securityfs).

Examples:
  /proc/self/mounts => proc:/self/mounts
  /sys/kernel/security/ => sys:/kernel/security/
  /dev/pts/0 => devpts:/0
