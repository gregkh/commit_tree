ext4: make the preallocation size be a multiple of stripe size

Previously, if a stripe width was provided, then it would be used
as the preallocation granularity, with no santiy checking and no
way to override this. Now, mb_prealloc_size defaults to the smallest
multiple of stripe size that is greater than or equal to the old
default mb_prealloc_size, and this can be overridden with the sysfs
interface.
