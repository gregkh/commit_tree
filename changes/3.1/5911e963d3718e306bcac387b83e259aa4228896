[SCSI] libsas: remove expander from dev list on error

If expander discovery fails (sas_discover_expander()), remove the
expander from the port device list (sas_ex_discover_expander()),
before freeing it. Else the list is corrupted and, e.g., when we
attempt to send SMP commands to other devices, the kernel oopses.
