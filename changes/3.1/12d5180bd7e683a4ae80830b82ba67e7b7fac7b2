drm/radeon/kms: fix channel_remap setup (v2)

Most asics just use the hw default value which requires
no explicit programming.  For those that need a different
value, the vbios will program it properly.  As such,
there's no need to program these registers explicitly
in the driver.  Changing MC_SHARED_CHREMAP requires a reload
of all data in vram otherwise its contents will be scambled.

v2: drop now unused channel_remap functions.
