drm/i915: fix CB tuning check for ILK+

CB tuning is needed to handle potential process variations that might
cause clock jitter for certain PLL settings.  However, we were setting
it incorrectly since we were using the wrong M value as a check (M1 when
we needed to use the whole M value).  Fix it up, making my HDMI
attached display a little prettier (used to have occasional dots crawl
across the display).
