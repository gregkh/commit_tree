[S390] Change default action from reipl to stop for on_restart

The main purpose for PSW restart will be kdump. Therefore customers will
issue "system restart" for creating a dump. If kdump is not enabled,
currently "PSW restart" will reboot the system and then no dump can
be created any more. In order to still allow a manual stand-alone dump in
the case a user issues "PSW restart" on a system that has not enabled
kdump we now stop the system.
