ARM: vmlinux.lds: use _text and _stext the same way as x86

x86 uses _text to mark the start of the kernel image including the
head text, and _stext to mark the start of the .text section.  Change
our vmlinux.lds to conform.  An audit of the places which use _stext
and _text in arch/arm indicates no users of either symbol are impacted
by this change.  It does mean a slight change to /proc/iomem output.
