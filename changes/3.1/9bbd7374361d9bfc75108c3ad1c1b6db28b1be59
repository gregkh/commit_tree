sched: update correct entity's runtime in check_preempt_wakeup()

While looking at check_preempt_wakeup() I realized that we are
potentially updating the wrong entity in the fair-group scheduling
case. In this case the current task's cfs_rq may not be the same as
the one used for the comparison between the waking task and the
existing task's vruntime.

This potentially results in us using a stale vruntime in the
pre-emption decision, providing a small false preference for the
previous task. The effects of this are bounded since we always
perform a hierarchal update on the tick.
