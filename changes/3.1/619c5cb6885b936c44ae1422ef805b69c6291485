New 7.0 FW: bnx2x, cnic, bnx2i, bnx2fc

New FW/HSI (7.0):
 - Added support to 578xx chips
 - Improved HSI - much less driver's direct access to the FW internal
   memory needed.

New implementation of the HSI handling layer in the bnx2x (bnx2x_sp.c):
 - Introduced chip dependent objects that have chip independent interfaces
   for configuration of MACs, multicast addresses, Rx mode, indirection table,
   fast path queues and function initialization/cleanup.
 - Objects functionality is based on the private function pointers, which
   allows not only a per-chip but also PF/VF differentiation while still
   preserving the same interface towards the driver.
 - Objects interface is not influenced by the HSI changes which do not require
   providing new parameters keeping the code outside the bnx2x_sp.c invariant
   with regard to such HSI chnages.

Changes in a CNIC, bnx2fc and bnx2i modules due to the new HSI.
