OpenRISC: System calls

The OpenRISC Linux kernel conforms to the "generic" syscall interface which
contains only the reduced set of syscalls deemed necessary for new
architectures.  Unfortunately, the uClibc port for OpenRISC does not fully
support this reduced set; as such, an additional patch available out-of-tree
needs to be applied to the kernel in order to use the current uClibc.  This
is just a temporary measure until the libc port can be straightened out; it
is likely that OpenRISC will make the transition to glibc shortly where the
generic syscall interface is better supported.
