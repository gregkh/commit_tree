ARM: 7015/1: ARM errata: Possible cache data corruption with hit-under-miss enabled

This patch is a workaround for the 364296 ARM1136 r0p2 erratum (possible
cache data corruption with hit-under-miss enabled). It sets the
undocumented bit 31 in the auxiliary control register and the FI bit in
the control register, thus disabling hit-under-miss without putting the
processor into full low interrupt latency mode.
