KVM: Steal time implementation

To implement steal time, we need the hypervisor to pass the guest
information about how much time was spent running other processes
outside the VM, while the vcpu had meaningful work to do - halt
time does not count.

This information is acquired through the run_delay field of
delayacct/schedstats infrastructure, that counts time spent in a
runqueue but not running.

Steal time is a per-cpu information, so the traditional MSR-based
infrastructure is used. A new msr, KVM_MSR_STEAL_TIME, holds the
memory area address containing information about steal time

This patch contains the hypervisor part of the steal time infrasructure,
and can be backported independently of the guest portion.
