net: ipv4: relax AF_INET check in bind()

commit d0733d2e29b65 (Check for mistakenly passed in non-IPv4 address)
added regression on legacy apps that use bind() with AF_UNSPEC family.

Relax the check, but make sure the bind() is done on INADDR_ANY
addresses, as AF_UNSPEC has probably no sane meaning for other
addresses.
