OMAP: hwmod: fix the i2c-reset timeout during bootup

The sequence of _ocp_softreset doesn't work for i2c. The i2c module has a
special sequence to reset the module. The sequence is
 - Disable the I2C.
 - Write to SOFTRESET bit.
 - Enable the I2C.
 - Poll on the RESETDONE bit.
The sequence is implemented as a function and the i2c_class is updated with
the correct 'reset' pointer.  omap_hwmod_softreset function is implemented
which triggers the softreset by writing into sysconfig register. On following
this sequence, i2c module resets properly and timeouts are not seen.
