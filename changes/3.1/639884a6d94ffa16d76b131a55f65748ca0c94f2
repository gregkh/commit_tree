[media] v4l2-ctrls: always send an event if a control changed implicitly

By default no control events are sent to the application that caused the
control value or flags change (i.e. the control(s) passed to VIDIOC_S_CTRL
or VIDIOC_S_EXT_CTRLS). But if a change in one control causes a change in
another control that was not part of the control(s) in VIDIOC_S_CTRL or
S_EXT_CTRLS, then the application should be notified.
