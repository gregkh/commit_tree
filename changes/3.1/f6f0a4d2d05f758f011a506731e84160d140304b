tipc: Convert name table publication lists to standard kernel lists

Modifies the main circular linked lists of publications used in TIPC's
name table to use the standard kernel linked list type. This change
simplifies the deletion of an existing publication by eliminating
the need to search up to three lists to locate the publication.
The use of standard list routines also helps improve the readability
of the name table code by make it clearer what each list operation
being performed is actually doing.
