x86, perf: P4 PMU - Fix typos in comments and style cleanup

This patch:

 - fixes typos in comments and clarifies the text
 - renames obscure p4_event_alias::original and ::alter members to
   ::original and ::alternative as appropriate
 - drops parenthesis from the return of p4_get_alias_event()

No functional changes.
