sparc: Allow handling signals when stack is corrupted.

If we can't push the pending register windows onto the user's stack,
we disallow signal delivery even if the signal would be delivered on a
valid seperate signal stack.

Add a register window save area in the signal frame, and store any
unsavable windows there.

On sigreturn, if any windows are still queued up in the signal frame,
try to push them back onto the stack and if that fails we kill the
process immediately.

This allows the debug/tst-longjmp_chk2 glibc test case to pass.
