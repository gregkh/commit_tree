um: fix oopsable race in line_close()

tty->count is decremented only after ->close() had been called and
several tasks can hit it in parallel.  As the result, using tty->count
to check if you are the last one is broken.  We end up leaving line->tty
not reset to NULL and the next IRQ on that sucker will blow up trying to
dereference pointers from kfree'd struct tty.

Fix is obvious: we need to use a counter of our own.
