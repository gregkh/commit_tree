xfs: re-enable non-blocking behaviour in xfs_map_blocks

The non-blockig behaviour in xfs_vm_writepage currently is conditional on
having both the WB_SYNC_NONE sync_mode and the nonblocking flag set.
The latter used to be used by both pdflush, kswapd and a few other places
in older kernels, but has been fading out starting with the introduction
of the per-bdi flusher threads.

Enable the non-blocking behaviour for all WB_SYNC_NONE calls to get back
the behaviour we want.
