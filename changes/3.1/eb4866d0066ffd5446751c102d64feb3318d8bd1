make /proc/$pid/numa_maps gather_stats() take variable page size

We need to teach the numa_maps code about transparent huge pages.  The
first step is to teach gather_stats() that the pte it is dealing with
might represent more than one page.

Note that will we use this in a moment for transparent huge pages since
they have use a single pmd_t which _acts_ as a "surrogate" for a bunch
of smaller pte_t's.

I'm a _bit_ unhappy that this interface counts in hugetlbfs page sizes
for hugetlbfs pages and PAGE_SIZE for normal pages.  That means that to
figure out how many _bytes_ "dirty=1" means, you must first know the
hugetlbfs page size.  That's easier said than done especially if you
don't have visibility in to the mount.

But, that's probably a discussion for another day especially since it
would change behavior to fix it.  But, just in case anyone wonders why
this patch only passes a '1' in the hugetlb case...
