lib: cordic: add library module providing cordic angle calculation

The brcm80211 driver in the staging tree has a cordic function to
determine cosine and sine for a given angle. Feedback received from
John Linville suggested that these kind of functions should be made
available to others as a library function in the kernel tree. The
b43 driver also has a cordic angle calculation implemented.
