ath9k_hw: initialize more timing related registers for half/quarter channels

Initialize the the clock-to-TSF field of AR_USEC and the SIFS and EIFS time
registers based on the clock rate instead of relying on initvals.
With those changes, some of the hardcoded AR9287 1.3+ specific overrides
can be dropped.
