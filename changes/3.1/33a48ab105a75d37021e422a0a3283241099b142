ibmveth: Fix DMA unmap error

Commit 6e8ab30ec677 (ibmveth: Add scatter-gather support) introduced a
DMA mapping API inconsistency resulting in dma_unmap_page getting
called on memory mapped via dma_map_single. This was seen when
CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG was enabled. Fix up this API usage inconsistency.
