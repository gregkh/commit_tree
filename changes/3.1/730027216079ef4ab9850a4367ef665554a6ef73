I2C: OMAP2+: increase omap_i2c_dev_attr flags from u8 to u32

As part of removing cpu_...() from the OMAP I2C driver, we need to
convert the CPU tests into functionality flags that are set by
hwmod class in the same way the IP revision is.

More flags are needed than will fit in the existing u8 flags
member of omap_i2c_dev_attr.

These flags can refer to options inside the IP block but they are
most needed for information about cpu implementation specific
options that are not part of the IP block itself.  For example,
how the CPU data bus is wired to the IP block databus differs
between OMAP cpus and affects how you must shift the address in
the IP block, but is not a feature of the IP block itself.
