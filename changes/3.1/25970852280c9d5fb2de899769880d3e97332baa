x86, x2apic: Preserve high 32-bits of IA32_APIC_BASE MSR

If there's no special reason to zero-out the "high" 32-bits of the IA32_APIC_BASE
MSR, let's preserve it.

The x2APIC Specification doesn't explicitly state any such requirement. (Sec 2.2
in: http://www.intel.com/Assets/PDF/manual/318148.pdf).
