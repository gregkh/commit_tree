Input: synaptics - fuzz position for touchpad with reduced filtering

Synaptics touchpads indicate via a capability bit when they perform reduced
filtering on position data. In such a case, use a non-zero fuzz value.
Fuzz = 8 was chosen empirically by observing the raw position data
reported by a clickpad indicating it had reduced filtering.
