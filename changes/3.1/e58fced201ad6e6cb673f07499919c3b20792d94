[media] videodev: fix a NULL pointer dereference in v4l2_device_release()

The change in 8280b66 does not cover the case when v4l2_dev is already
NULL, fix that.

With a Kinect sensor, seen as an USB camera using GSPCA in this context,
a NULL pointer dereference BUG can be triggered by just unplugging the
device after the camera driver has been loaded.
