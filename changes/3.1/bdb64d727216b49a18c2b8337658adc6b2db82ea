usb: gadget: add SuperSpeed support to the Gadget Framework

SuperSpeed USB has defined a new descriptor, called
the Binary Device Object Store (BOS) Descriptor. It
has also changed a bit the definition of SET_FEATURE
and GET_STATUS requests to add USB3-specific details.

This patch implements both changes to the Composite
Gadget Framework.
