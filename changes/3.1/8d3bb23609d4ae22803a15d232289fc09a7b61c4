drm/ttm: ensure ttm for new node is bound before calling move_notify()

This was true for new TTM_PL_SYSTEM and new TTM_PL_TT cases, but wasn't
the case on TTM_PL_SYSTEM<->TTM_PL_TT moves, which causes trouble on some
paths as nouveau's move_notify() hook requires that the dma addresses be
valid at this point.
