mm: tidy vmtruncate_range and related functions

Use consistent variable names in truncate_pagecache(), truncate_setsize(),
vmtruncate() and vmtruncate_range().

unmap_mapping_range() and vmtruncate_range() have mismatched interfaces:
don't change either, but make the vmtruncates more precise about what they
expect unmap_mapping_range() to do.

vmtruncate_range() is currently called only with page-aligned start and
end+1: can handle unaligned start, but unaligned end+1 would hit BUG_ON in
truncate_inode_pages_range() (lacks partial clearing of the end page).
