ext4: punch hole optimizations: skip un-needed extent lookup

This patch optimizes the punch hole operation by skipping the
tree walking code that is used by truncate.  Since punch hole
is done through map blocks, the path to the extent is already
known in this function, so we do not need to look it up again.
