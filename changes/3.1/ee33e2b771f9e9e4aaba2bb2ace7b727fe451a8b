[SCSI] isci: fix 32-bit operation when CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=n

The unsolicited frame control infrastructure requires a table of dma
addresses for the hardware to lookup the frame buffer location by an
index.  The hardware expects the elements of this table to be 64-bit
quantities, so we cannot reference these elements as dma_addr_t.  All
unsolicited frame protocols are affected, particularly SATA-PIO and SMP
which prevented direct-attached SATA drives and expander-attached drives
to not be discovered.
