PCI: pciehp: change wait time for valid configuration access

Naoki Yanagimoto reported that configuration read on some hot-added
PCIe device returns invalid value. This patch fixes this problem.

According to the PCIe spec, software must wait for at least 1 second
to judge if the hot-added device is broken after Data Link Layer State
Changed Event. This patch changes pciehp driver to wait for 1 second
after the Data Link Layer State Changed Event is detected before
initiating a configuration access instead of 100 ms.
