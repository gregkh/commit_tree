ath9k: add external_reset callback to ath9k_platfom_data for AR9330

The patch adds a callback to ath9k_platform_data. If the
callback is provided by the platform code, then it can be
used to hard reset the WMAC device.

The callback is required for doing a hard reset of the AR9330
chips to get them working again after a hang.
