ARM: twd: register clockevents device before enabling PPI

The smp_twd clockevents driver currently enables the local timer PPI
before the clockevents device is registered. This can lead to a kernel
panic if a spurious timer interrupt is generated before registration
has completed since the kernel will treat it as an IPI timer.

This patch moves the clockevents device registration before the IRQ
unmasking so that we can always handle timer interrupts once they can
occur.
