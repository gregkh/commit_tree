ptrace: ptrace_check_attach(): rename @kill to @ignore_state and add comments

PTRACE_INTERRUPT is going to be added which should also skip
task_is_traced() check in ptrace_check_attach().  Rename @kill to
@ignore_state and make it bool.  Add function comment while at it.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior difference.
