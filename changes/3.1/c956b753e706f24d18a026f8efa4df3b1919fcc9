OMAP: powerdomains: Make all powerdomain target states as ON at init

Program all powerdomain target state as ON; this is to prevent domains
from hitting low power states (if bootloader has target states set to
something other than ON) and potentially even losing context while PM
is not fully initialized, which can cause the system to crash.  The PM
late init code can then program the desired target state for all the
power domains.
