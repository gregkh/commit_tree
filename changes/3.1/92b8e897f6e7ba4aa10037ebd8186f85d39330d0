btrfs: Don't BUG_ON alloc_path errors in find_next_chunk

I also removed the BUG_ON from error return of find_next_chunk in
init_first_rw_device(). It turns out that the only caller of
init_first_rw_device() also BUGS on any nonzero return so no actual behavior
change has occurred here.

do_chunk_alloc() also needed an update since it calls btrfs_alloc_chunk()
which can now return -ENOMEM. Instead of setting space_info->full on any
error from btrfs_alloc_chunk() I catch and return every error value _except_
-ENOSPC. Thanks goes to Tsutomu Itoh for pointing that issue out.
