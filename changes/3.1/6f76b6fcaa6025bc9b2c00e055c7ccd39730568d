CodingStyle: Document the exception of not splitting user-visible strings, for grepping

Patch reviewers now recommend not splitting long user-visible strings,
such as printk messages, even if they exceed 80 columns.  This avoids
breaking grep.  However, that recommendation did not actually appear
anywhere in Documentation/CodingStyle.

See, for example, the thread at
