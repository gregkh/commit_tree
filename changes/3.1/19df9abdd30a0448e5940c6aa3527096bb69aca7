powerpc/pseries: Fix hvterm_raw_get_chars to accept < 16 chars, fixing xmon

commit 4d2bb3f50036 (powerpc/pseries: Re-implement HVSI as part of
hvc_vio) changed udbg_getc to be based on hvterm_raw_get_chars.
Unfortunately hvterm_raw_get_chars returns -EAGAIN if you ask
for anything less than 16 characters. As a result xmon no longer
accepts input and prints a stream of junk to the screen.

The recent change highlights a problem that xmon on pseries VIO
has had all along, that it can drop input characters. The issue
is the hypervisor call does not take a count argument and can
return up to 16 characters.

This patch adds a per vterm buffer that we copy input data into
and give it out as requested.
