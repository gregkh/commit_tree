vxge: fix 64 bit access on 32 bit platforms

Need to add stat_sync wrapper around 64 bit statistic values.
Fix wraparound bug in lockup detector where it is unsafely comparing
64 bit value that is not atomic. Since only care about detecting activity
just looking at current low order bits will work.

Remove unused entries in old vxge_sw_stats structure.
Change the error counters to unsigned long since they won't grow so large
as to have to be 64 bits.
