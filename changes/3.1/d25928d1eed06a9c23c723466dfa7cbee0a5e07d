mmc: sdhci: fix interrupt storm from card detection

The issue was initially found by Eric Benard as below.

Not sure about other SDHCI based controller, but on Freescale eSDHC,
the SDHCI_INT_CARD_INSERT bits will be immediately set again when it
gets cleared, if a card is inserted. The driver need to mask the irq
to prevent interrupt storm which will freeze the system.  And the
SDHCI_INT_CARD_REMOVE gets the same situation.

The patch fixes the problem based on the initial idea from
Eric Benard.
