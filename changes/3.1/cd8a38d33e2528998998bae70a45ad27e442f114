perf_events: Fix validation of events using an extra reg

The validate_group() function needs to validate events with
extra shared regs. Within an event group, only events with
the same value for the extra reg can co-exist. This was not
checked by validate_group() because it was missing the
shared_regs logic.

This patch changes the allocation of the fake cpuc used for
validation to also point to a fake shared_regs structure such
that group events be properly testing.

It modifies __intel_shared_reg_get_constraints() to use
spin_lock_irqsave() to avoid lockdep issues.
