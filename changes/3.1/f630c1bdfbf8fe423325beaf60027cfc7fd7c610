ARM: 7091/1: errata: D-cache line maintenance operation by MVA may not succeed

This patch implements a workaround for erratum 764369 affecting
Cortex-A9 MPCore with two or more processors (all current revisions).
Under certain timing circumstances, a data cache line maintenance
operation by MVA targeting an Inner Shareable memory region may fail to
proceed up to either the Point of Coherency or to the Point of
Unification of the system. This workaround adds a DSB instruction before
the relevant cache maintenance functions and sets a specific bit in the
diagnostic control register of the SCU.
