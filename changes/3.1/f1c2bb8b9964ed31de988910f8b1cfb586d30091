um: implement a x86_64 vDSO

Until now UML had no x86_64 vDSO.  So glibc always used the vsyscall page
for gettimeday() and friends.  Calls to gettimeday() returned falsely the
host time and confused some programs.

This patch adds a vDSO which turns all __vdso_* calls into a system call
so that UML can trap them.

As glibc still uses the vsyscall page for static binaries this patch
improves the situation only for dynamic binaries.
