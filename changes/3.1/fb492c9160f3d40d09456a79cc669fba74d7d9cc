ARM: 7067/1: mm: keep significant bits in pfn_valid

When ARCH_HAS_HOLES_MEMORYMODEL is selected, pfn_valid calls
memblock_is_memory to test validity of a pfn:

> memblock_is_memory(pfn << PAGE_SHIFT);

On LPAE systems this cuts off the top bits, as the shift occurs before
the value is promoted to a phys_addr_t.

This patch replaces the shift with a call to __pfn_to_phys (which casts
pfn to phys_addr_t before shifting), preventing the loss of significant
bits.
