perf: Change close() semantics for group events

In order to always call list_del_event() on the correct cpu if the
event is part of an active context and avoid having to do two IPIs,
change the close() semantics slightly.

The current perf_event_disable() call would disable a whole group if
the event that's being closed is the group leader, whereas the new
code keeps the group siblings enabled.

People should not rely on this behaviour and I don't think they do,
but in case we find they do, the fix is easy and we have to take the
double IPI cost.
