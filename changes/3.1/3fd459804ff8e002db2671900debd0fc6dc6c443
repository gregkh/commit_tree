[SCSI] bfa: Brocade-1860 Fabric Adapter vHBA support.

- Introduced partitioning of the BFA resources.
- Added h/w queue ID in CPE messages, firmware uses h/w queue ID
  from messages to pick a matching RME queue.
- Added message header to bfa_reqq_produce(). h/w queue ID is set
  in the message header and firmware modules use h/w queue ID from
  message header instead of from cpqe event.
- Made changes to allow using all 256 queues of Brocade-1860 asic.
  Previously only a single queue per queue group was used.
- Added function tag to BFI message header. Only used by FC BFI
  messages.  Used to translate host tag to firmware tag. bfa_lpuid()
  is changed to bfa_fn_lpu() that encodes both PCI function and port
  ID in BFI message header.
