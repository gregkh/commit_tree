[media] v4l2-events/fh: merge v4l2_events into v4l2_fh

Drivers that supported events used to be rare, but now that controls can also
raise events this will become much more common since almost all drivers have
controls.

This means that keeping struct v4l2_events as a separate struct make no more
sense. Merging it into struct v4l2_fh simplifies things substantially as it
is now an integral part of the filehandle struct.
