tracing: Have "enable" file use refcounts like the "filter" file

The "enable" file for the event system can be removed when a module
is unloaded and the event system only has events from that module.
As the event system nr_events count goes to zero, it may be freed
if its ref_count is also set to zero.

Like the "filter" file, the "enable" file may be opened by a task and
referenced later, after a module has been unloaded and the events for
that event system have been removed.

Although the "filter" file referenced the event system structure,
the "enable" file only references a pointer to the event system
name. Since the name is freed when the event system is removed,
it is possible that an access to the "enable" file may reference
a freed pointer.

Update the "enable" file to use the subsystem_open() routine that
the "filter" file uses, to keep a reference to the event system
structure while the "enable" file is opened.
