Bluetooth: Don't use cmd_timer to timeout HCI reset command

No command should be send before Command Complete event for HCI
reset is received. This fix regression introduced by commit
6bd32326cda(Bluetooth: Use proper timer for hci command timout)
for chips whose reset command takes longer to complete (e.g. CSR)
resulting in next command being send before HCI reset completed.
