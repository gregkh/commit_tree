tmpfs: no need to use i_lock

2.6.36's 7e496299d4d2 ("tmpfs: make tmpfs scalable with percpu_counter for
used blocks") to make tmpfs scalable with percpu_counter used
inode->i_lock in place of sbinfo->stat_lock around i_blocks updates; but
that was adverse to scalability, and unnecessary, since info->lock is
already held there in the fast paths.

Remove those uses of i_lock, and add info->lock in the three error paths
where it's then needed across shmem_free_blocks().  It's not actually
needed across shmem_unacct_blocks(), but they're so often paired that it
looks wrong to split them apart.
