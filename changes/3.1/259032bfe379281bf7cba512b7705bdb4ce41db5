perf: Robustify proc and debugfs file recording

While attempting to create a timechart of boot up I found perf didn't
tolerate modules being loaded/unloaded.  This patch fixes this by
reading the file once and then writing the size read at the correct
point in the file.  It also simplifies the code somewhat.
