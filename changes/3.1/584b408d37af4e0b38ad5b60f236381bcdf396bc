Revert "i2c-omap: fix static suspend vs. runtime suspend"

This reverts commit adf6e07922255937c8bfeea777d19502b4c9a2be.

Remove system PM methods which can race with runtime PM methods.

Also, as of v3.1, the PM domain level code for OMAP handles device
power state transistions automatically for devices, so drivers no
longer need to specifically call the bus/pm_domain methods themselves.
