ALSA: usb-audio - Add quirk for  Roland / BOSS BR-800

Add support for Roland/BOSS BR-800 (0582:011e) to snd-usb-audio driver.

This allows playback and recording, which has been tested and found to
work. The third interface should be MIDI (MTC/SMPTE?) for DAW interface
and is set as per ME-25, but this has not been tested. SDHC card access
is already supported by usb-storage for Backup/Rhythm Editor/Wave
Convertor mode which should not conflict with this.
