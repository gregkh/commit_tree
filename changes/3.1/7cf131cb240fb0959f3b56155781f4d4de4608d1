staging/lirc_parallel: fix panic on rmmod

lirc_parallel seems to leave a bunch of stuff around after rmmod.
Without the patch below modprobe ; rmmod ; modprobe will cause a panic.

There are still some remaining problems, (double registration of sysfs files)
but this patch is at least a start to survive the panic.
