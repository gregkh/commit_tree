ARM: vmlinux.lds: move init sections between text and data sections

Place the init sections between the text and data sections.  This
means all code is grouped together at the beginning of the kernel
image, and all data is at the end of the image.  This avoids problems
with the 24-bit branch instruction relocations becoming invalid with
large initramfs images.
