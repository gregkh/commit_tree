ASoC: AD1836: Remove unused fields from private struct

The control_type field is never used, so it can be removed.  The
control_data field is used to initialize the codec's control_data field,
but since this is also done by the snd-soc-cache core, the redundant
assignment can be removed and the field can be dropped.
