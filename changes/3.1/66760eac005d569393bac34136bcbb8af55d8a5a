ath9k: improve reliability of MIC error detection

For unicast the hardware sometimes reports MIC errors even though the
frame that it received actually contains a valid MIC - on some chips this
can happen frequently enough to trigger TKIP countermeasures.
Fix this issue by not reporting MIC errors for unicast frames with a
valid key, letting mac80211 validate the MIC instead.

Additionally, strip the MIC for all frames that the hardware considers
valid to avoid wasting CPU cycles re-validating it.
