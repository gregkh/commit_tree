mac80211: simplify RX PN/IV handling

The current rx->queue value is slightly confusing.
It is set to 16 on non-QoS frames, including data,
and then used for sequence number and PN/IV checks.
Until recently, we had a TKIP IV checking bug that
had been introduced in 2008 to fix a seqno issue.
Before that, we always used TID 0 for checking the
PN or IV on non-QoS packets.

Go back to the old status for PN/IV checks using
the TID 0 counter for non-QoS by splitting up the
rx->queue value into "seqno_idx" and "security_idx"
in order to avoid confusion in the future. They
each have special rules on the value used for non-
QoS data frames.

Since the handling is now unified, also revert the
special TKIP handling from my patch
"mac80211: fix TKIP replay vulnerability".
