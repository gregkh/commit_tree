Btrfs: fix pages truncation in btrfs_ioctl_clone()

It's a bug in commit f81c9cdc567cd3160ff9e64868d9a1a7ee226480
(Btrfs: truncate pages from clone ioctl target range)

We should pass the dest range to the truncate function, but not the
src range.

Also move the function before locking extent state.
