ACPI: add missing _OSI strings

Linux supports some optional features, but it should notify the BIOS about
them via the _OSI method.  Currently Linux doesn't notify any, which might
make such features not work because the BIOS doesn't know about them.

Jarosz has a system which needs this to make ACPI processor aggregator
device work.
