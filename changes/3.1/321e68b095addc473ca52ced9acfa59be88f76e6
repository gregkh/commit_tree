tracing, function_graph: Remove dependency of abstime and duration fields on latency

The display of absolute time and duration fields is based on the
latency field. This was added during the irqsoff/wakeup tracers
graph support changes.

It's causing confusion in what fields will be displayed for the
function_graph tracer itself. So I'm removing this depency, and
adding absolute time and duration fields to the preemptirqsoff
preemptoff irqsoff wakeup tracers.

With following commands:
	# echo function_graph > ./current_tracer
	# cat trace

This is what it looked like before:
# tracer: function_graph
#
#     TIME        CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
#      |          |     |   |                     |   |   |   |
 0)   0.068 us    |          } /* page_add_file_rmap */
 0)               |          _raw_spin_unlock() {
...

This is what it looks like now:
# tracer: function_graph
#
# CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
# |     |   |                     |   |   |   |
 0)   0.068 us    |                } /* add_preempt_count */
 0)   0.993 us    |              } /* vfsmount_lock_local_lock */
...

For preemptirqsoff preemptoff irqsoff wakeup tracers,
this is what it looked like before:
SNIP
#                       _-----=> irqs-off
#                      / _----=> need-resched
#                     | / _---=> hardirq/softirq
#                     || / _--=> preempt-depth
#                     ||| / _-=> lock-depth
#                     |||| /
# CPU  TASK/PID       |||||  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS
# |     |    |        |||||   |   |                     |   |   |   |
 1)    <idle>-0    |  d..1  0.000 us    |  acpi_idle_enter_simple();
...

This is what it looks like now:
SNIP
#
#                                       _-----=> irqs-off
#                                      / _----=> need-resched
#                                     | / _---=> hardirq/softirq
