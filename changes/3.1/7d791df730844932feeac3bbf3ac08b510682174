[SCSI] lpfc 8.3.25: Add FCF priority failover functionality

This patch implements a new FCF failover policy for the lpfc driver. It
allows the driver to choose which FCF to failover to based on the FCF
priority. This patch also introduces a new sysfs parameter
(fcf_failover_policy) to allow the user to choose which FCF failover policy
to use.
