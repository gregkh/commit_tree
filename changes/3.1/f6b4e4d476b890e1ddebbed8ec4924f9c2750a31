ath9k: Fix locking issue during tx completion

The received tx status of aggregated frame without BlockAck may
cause deaf state in AR5416 cards. So the driver does a reset to
recover. When this happens, we release the pcu_lock before doing
a reset as ath_rest acquires pcu_lock. This is ugly and also not
atomic. Fixing this addresses the TX DMA failure also.

ath_tx_complete_aggr can be called from different paths which
takes different variants of spin_lock. This patch also addresses
the following warning.
