KVM guest: Steal time accounting

This patch accounts steal time time in account_process_tick.
If one or more tick is considered stolen in the current
accounting cycle, user/system accounting is skipped. Idle is fine,
since the hypervisor does not report steal time if the guest
is halted.

Accounting steal time from the core scheduler give us the
advantage of direct acess to the runqueue data. In a later
opportunity, it can be used to tweak cpu power and make
the scheduler aware of the time it lost.
