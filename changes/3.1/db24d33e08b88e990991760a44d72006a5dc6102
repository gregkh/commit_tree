perf: Change and simplify ctx::is_active semantics

Instead of tracking if a context is active or not, track which events
of the context are active. By making it a bitmask of
EVENT_PINNED|EVENT_FLEXIBLE we can simplify some of the scheduling
routines since it can avoid adding events that are already active.
