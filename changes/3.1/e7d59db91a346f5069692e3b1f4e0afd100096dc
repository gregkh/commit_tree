ARM: 7004/1: fix traps.h compile warnings

Building kernel 3.0 for an n2100 (plat-iop) results in:

In file included from arch/arm/plat-iop/cp6.c:20:
/tmp/linux-3.0/arch/arm/include/asm/traps.h:12: warning: 'struct pt_regs' declared inside parameter list
/tmp/linux-3.0/arch/arm/include/asm/traps.h:12: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want
/tmp/linux-3.0/arch/arm/include/asm/traps.h:48: warning: 'struct pt_regs' declared inside parameter list
/tmp/linux-3.0/arch/arm/include/asm/traps.h:48: warning: 'struct task_struct' declared inside parameter list
arch/arm/plat-iop/cp6.c:45: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type

Nothing here depends on the layout of pt_regs or task_struct, so this
can be fixed by adding forward struct declarations to asm/traps.h.
