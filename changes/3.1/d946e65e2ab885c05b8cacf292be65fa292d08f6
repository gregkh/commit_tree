HID: add FF support for Holtek On Line Grip based gamepads

Add force feedback support for Holtek On Line Grip based HID devices.

The protocol is more complex than that of most other rumblepads, but the
device still needs to be handled as a memoryless one.

Tested by Cleber de Mattos Casali with a 1241:5015 "Clone Joypad Super
Power Fire" gamepad, with help from Hendrik Iben <hendrik_iben@web.de>.
