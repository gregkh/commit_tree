x86-64: Add user_64bit_mode paravirt op

Three places in the kernel assume that the only long mode CPL 3
selector is __USER_CS.  This is not true on Xen -- Xen's sysretq
changes cs to the magic value 0xe033.

Two of the places are corner cases, but as of "x86-64: Improve
vsyscall emulation CS and RIP handling"
(c9712944b2a12373cb6ff8059afcfb7e826a6c54), vsyscalls will segfault
if called with Xen's extra CS selector.  This causes a panic when
older init builds die.

It seems impossible to make Xen use __USER_CS reliably without
taking a performance hit on every system call, so this fixes the
tests instead with a new paravirt op.  It's a little ugly because
ptrace.h can't include paravirt.h.
