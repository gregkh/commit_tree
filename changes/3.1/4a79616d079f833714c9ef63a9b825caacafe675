ALSA: hda - Unify output-control parsing in patch_via.c

Parse the output-paths more dynamically, i.e. traverse the paths
from each output pin instead of fixed assignment for each codec.
Now all codecs are using the same output parser code.

The smart51 setup doesn't work with this change, and will be fixed
in the next commits.
