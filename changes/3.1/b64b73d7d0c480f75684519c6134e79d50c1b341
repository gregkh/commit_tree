bridge: leave carrier on for empty bridge

This resolves a regression seen by some users of bridging.
Some users use the bridge like a dummy device.
They expect to be able to put an IPv6 address on the device
with no ports attached. Although there are better ways of doing
this, there is no reason to not allow it.

Note: the bridge still will reflect the state of ports in the
bridge if there are any added.
