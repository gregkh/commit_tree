OpenRISC: PTrace

This patch implements minimal PTrace support.  The pt_regs structure is
not exported to userspace for OpenRISC; rather, the GETREGSET mechanism
is intended to be used and the registers, as such, exported in the core
dump format which is ABI stable.  This is in line with what is intended
for new architectures as of 2.6.34 and has the advantage of permitting
the layout of the registers on the kernel stack (as per pt_regs) to be
freely modified.
