intel drivers: repair missing flush operations

after review of all intel drivers, found several instances where
drivers had the incorrect pattern of:
memory mapped write();
delay();

which should always be:
memory mapped write();
write flush(); /* aka memory mapped read */
delay();

explanation:
The reason for including the flush is that writes can be held
(posted) in PCI/PCIe bridges, but the read always has to complete
synchronously and therefore has to flush all pending writes to a
device.  If a write is held and followed by a delay, the delay
means nothing because the write may not have reached hardware
(maybe even not until the next read)
