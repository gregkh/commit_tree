PM / Runtime: Prevent runtime_resume from racing with probe

This patch (as1475) adds device_lock() and device_unlock() calls to
the store methods for the power/control and power/autosuspend_delay_ms
sysfs attribute files.  We don't want badly timed writes to these
files to cause runtime_resume callbacks to occur while a driver is
being probed for a device.
