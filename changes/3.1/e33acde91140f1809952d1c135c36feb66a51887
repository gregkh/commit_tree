iommu/amd: Don't take domain->lock recursivly

The domain_flush_devices() function takes the domain->lock.
But this function is only called from update_domain() which
itself is already called unter the domain->lock. This causes
a deadlock situation when the dma-address-space of a domain
grows larger than 1GB.
