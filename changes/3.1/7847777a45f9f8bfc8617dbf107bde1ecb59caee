atomic: cleanup asm-generic atomic*.h inclusion

After changing all consumers of atomics to include <linux/atomic.h>, we
ran into some compile time errors due to this dependency chain:

linux/atomic.h
  -> asm/atomic.h
    -> asm-generic/atomic-long.h

where atomic-long.h could use funcs defined later in linux/atomic.h
without a prototype.  This patches moves the code that includes
asm-generic/atomic*.h to linux/atomic.h.

Archs that need <asm-generic/atomic64.h> need to select
CONFIG_GENERIC_ATOMIC64 from now on (some of them used to include it
unconditionally).

Compile tested on i386 and x86_64 with allnoconfig.
