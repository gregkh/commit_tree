batman-adv: Replace version info instead of appending them

The version number of modules build outside of the tree can get revision
numbers added. This is useful to give hints about the revision of a
distribution package and the used patchset. The prepended source number or
branch name doesn't add any additional information which would help to identify
problems and can therefore be omitted.
