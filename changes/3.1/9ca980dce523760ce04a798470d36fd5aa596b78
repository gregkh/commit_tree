powerpc: Avoid extra indirect function call in sending IPIs

On many platforms (including pSeries), smp_ops->message_pass is always
smp_muxed_ipi_message_pass.  This changes arch/powerpc/kernel/smp.c so
that if smp_ops->message_pass is NULL, it calls smp_muxed_ipi_message_pass
directly.

This means that a platform doesn't need to set both .message_pass and
.cause_ipi, only one of them.  It is a slight performance improvement
in that it gets rid of an indirect function call at the expense of a
predictable conditional branch.
