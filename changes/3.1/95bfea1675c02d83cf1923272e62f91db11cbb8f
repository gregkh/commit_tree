dmaengine: mxs-dma: skip request_irq for NO_IRQ

In general, the mxs-dma users get separate irq for each channel,
but gpmi is special one which has only one irq shared by all gpmi
channels.  It causes mxs_dma channel allocation function fail for
all other gpmi channels except the first one calling into the
function.

The patch gets request_irq call skipped for NO_IRQ case, and leaves
this gpmi specific quirk to gpmi driver to sort out.  It will fix
above problem if gpmi driver sets chan_irq as gpmi irq for only one
channel and NO_IRQ for all the rest channels.
