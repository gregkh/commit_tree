ALSA: hda: Separate generic and non-generic implementations

A future change will significantly rework the generic implementation
in order to support codecs with a different number of pins and
converters. Isolate the more custom codec variants from this change by
duplicating the small portions of generic code they share. This
simplifies the later rework of that previously shared code, since we
don't have to consider the more custom codecs, and also prevents
support for those codecs from regressing.
