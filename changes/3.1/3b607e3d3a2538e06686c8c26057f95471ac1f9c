ALSA: hda - Switch HP DAC dynamically with indep-HP switch for VIA

This patch changes the behavior of independent-HP enum switch.  Now
instead of returning a busy error, the driver switches dynamically the
stream of the HP (and shared) DACs according to the current mode.
The logic is similar like the dual-mic ADC switch, but a bit more
complicated because of the presence of shared DAC.

Together with the change, a mutex is introduced to protect against the
possible races for the indep-HP mode setting.
