AppArmor: Fix reference to rcu protected pointer outside of rcu_read_lock

The pointer returned from tracehook_tracer_task() is only valid inside
the rcu_read_lock.  However the tracer pointer obtained is being passed
to aa_may_ptrace outside of the rcu_read_lock critical section.

Mover the aa_may_ptrace test into the rcu_read_lock critical section, to
fix this.

Kernels affected: 2.6.36 - 3.0
