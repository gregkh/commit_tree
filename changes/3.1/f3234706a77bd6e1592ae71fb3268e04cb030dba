drm/i915: Initialize RCS ring status page address in intel_render_ring_init_dri

Physically-addressed hardware status pages are initialized early in
the driver load process by i915_init_phys_hws. For UMS environments,
the ring structure is not initialized until the X server starts. At
that point, the entire ring structure is re-initialized with all new
values. Any values set in the ring structure (including
ring->status_page.page_addr) will be lost when the ring is
re-initialized.

This patch moves the initialization of the status_page.page_addr value
to intel_render_ring_init_dri.
