eCryptfs: fix compile error

This patch fixes the compile error reported at the address:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40292

The problem arises when compiling eCryptfs as built-in and the 'encrypted'
key type as a module. The patch prevents this combination from being set in
the kernel configuration, by fixing the eCryptfs dependencies.
