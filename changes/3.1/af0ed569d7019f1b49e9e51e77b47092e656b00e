ceph: fix snap writeback when racing with writes

There are two problems that come up when we try to queue a capsnap while a
write is in progress:

 - The FILE_WR cap is held, but not yet dirty, so we may queue a capsnap
   with dirty == 0.  That will crash later in __ceph_flush_snaps().  Or
   on the FILE_WR cap if a write is in progress.
 - We may not have i_head_snapc set, which causes problems pretty quickly.
   Look to the snaprealm in this case.
