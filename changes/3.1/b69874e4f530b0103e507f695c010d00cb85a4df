ARM: pm: arrange for cpu_proc_init() to be called on resume

cpu_proc_init() does processor specific initialization, which we do
at boot time.  We have been omitting to do this on resume, which
causes some of this initialization to be skipped.  We've also been
skipping this on SMP initialization too.

Ensure that cpu_proc_init() is always called appropriately by
moving it into cpu_init(), and move cpu_init() to a more appropriate
point in the boot initialization.
