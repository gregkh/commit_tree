EHCI: only power off port if over-current is active

MAX4967 USB power supply chip we use on our boards signals over-current when
power is not enabled; once it's enabled, over-current signal returns to normal.
That unfortunately caused the endless stream of "over-current change on port"
messages. The EHCI root hub code reacts on every over-current signal change
with powering off the port -- such change event is generated the moment the
port power is enabled, so once enabled the power is immediately cut off.
I think we should only cut off power when we're seeing the active over-current
signal, so I'm adding such check to that code. I also think that the fact that
we've cut off the port power should be reflected in the result of GetPortStatus
request immediately, hence I'm adding a PORTSCn register readback after write...
