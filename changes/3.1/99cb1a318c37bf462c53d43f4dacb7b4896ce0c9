jbd: Add fixed tracepoints

This commit adds fixed tracepoint for jbd. It has been based on fixed
tracepoints for jbd2, however there are missing those for collecting
statistics, since I think that it will require more intrusive patch so I
should have its own commit, if someone decide that it is needed. Also
there are new tracepoints in __journal_drop_transaction() and
journal_update_superblock().

The list of jbd tracepoints:

jbd_checkpoint
jbd_start_commit
jbd_commit_locking
jbd_commit_flushing
jbd_commit_logging
jbd_drop_transaction
jbd_end_commit
jbd_do_submit_data
jbd_cleanup_journal_tail
jbd_update_superblock_end
