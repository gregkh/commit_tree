powerpc/e500: SPE register saving: take arbitrary struct offset

Previously, these macros hardcoded THREAD_EVR0 as the base of the save
area, relative to the base register passed.  This base offset is now
passed as a separate macro parameter, allowing reuse with other SPE
save areas, such as used by KVM.
