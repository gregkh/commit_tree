target: Add missing DATA_SG_IO transport_cmd_get_valid_sectors check

This patch adds the missing transport_cmd_get_valid_sectors() check for
SCF_SCSI_DATA_SG_IO_CDB type payloads to ensure that a received LBA + range
does not exeed past the end of associated backend struct se_device.

This patch also fixes a bug in the failure path of transport_new_cmd_obj()
where this check can fail, so change to use a signed 'rc' and return '-EINVAL'
to signal proper transport_generic_request_failure() handling.
