xen-blkback: Don't disconnect backend until state switched to XenbusStateClosed.

When do block-attach/block-detach test with below steps, umount hangs
in the guest. Furthermore shutdown ends up being stuck when umounting file-systems.

1. start guest.
2. attach new block device by xm block-attach in Dom0.
3. mount new disk in guest.
4. execute xm block-detach to detach the block device in dom0 until timeout
5. Any request to the disk will hung.

Root cause:
This issue is caused when setting backend device's state to
'XenbusStateClosing', which sends to the frontend the XenbusStateClosing
notification. When frontend receives the notification it tries to release
the disk in blkfront_closing(), but at that moment the disk is still in use
by guest, so frontend refuses to close. Specifically it sets the disk state to
XenbusStateClosing and sends the notification to backend - when backend receives the
event, it disconnects the vbd from real device, and sets the vbd device state to
XenbusStateClosing. The backend disconnects the real device/file, and any IO
requests to the disk in guest will end up in ether, leaving disk DEAD and set to
XenbusStateClosing. When the guest wants to disconnect the disk, umount will
hang on blkif_release()->xlvbd_release_gendisk() as it is unable to send any IO
to the disk, which prevents clean system shutdown.

Solution:
Don't disconnect backend until frontend state switched to XenbusStateClosed.
