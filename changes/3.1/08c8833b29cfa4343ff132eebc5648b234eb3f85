ixgbe: add structure for containing RX/TX rings to q_vector

This patch adds support for a ring container structure to be used within
the q_vector.  The basic idea is to provide a means of separating the RX
and TX rings while maintaining a common structure for their containment.
The advantage to this is that later we should be able to pass this
structure to the update_itr functions without needing to pass individual
rings.
