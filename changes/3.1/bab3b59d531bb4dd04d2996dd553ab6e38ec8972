ASoC: codecs: Max98095: Fix logging of hardware revision.

The base hardware revision of the Maxim 98095 part is 0x40; the code
which outputs the revision of the hardware has been updated to
properly use uppercase alphabetic values for the revision numbers.

Also, the use of a constant for the length 'max98095_dai' has been
replaced with ARRAY_SIZE().
