powerpc/e500: Save SPEFCSR in flush_spe_to_thread()

giveup_spe() saves the SPE state which is protected by MSR[SPE].
However, modifying SPEFSCR does not trap when MSR[SPE]=0.
And since SPEFSCR is already saved/restored in _switch(),
not all the callers want to save SPEFSCR again.
Thus, saving SPEFSCR should not belong to giveup_spe().

This patch moves SPEFSCR saving to flush_spe_to_thread(),
and cleans up the caller that needs to save SPEFSCR accordingly.
