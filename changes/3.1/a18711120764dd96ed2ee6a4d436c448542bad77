drm/i915: Use the LLC mode on gen6 for everything but display.

Improves full-screen openarena on my laptop 20.3% +/- 4.0% (n=3)
Improves 800x600 nexuiz on my laptop 12.3% +/- 0.1% (n=3)

We have more room to improve with doing LLC caching for display using
GFDT, and in doing LLC+MLC caching, but this was an easy performance
win and incremental improvement toward those two.
