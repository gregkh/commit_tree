drm: really make debug levels match in edid failure code

Also disable the ascii dump and remove the literal printing of the
KERN_ERR macro in the log:

   [drm:drm_edid_block_valid] *ERROR* Raw EDID:
   <3>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................

v2: Remove the trailing empty line as well.
