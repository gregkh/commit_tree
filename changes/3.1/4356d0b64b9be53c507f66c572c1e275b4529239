IB/qib: Fix potential deadlock with link down interrupt

There is a possibility of a deadlock due to the way locks are
acquired and released in qib_set_uevent_bits(). The function
qib_set_uevent_bits() is called in process context and it uses
spin_lock() and spin_unlock().  This same lock is acquired/released
in interrupt context which can lead to a deadlock when running on
the same cpu.

The fix is to replace spin_lock() and spin_unlock() with
spin_lock_irqsave() and spin_unlock_irqrestore() respectively in
qib_set_uevent_bits().
