tmpfs: use kmemdup for short symlinks

But we've not yet removed the old swp_entry_t i_direct[16] from
shmem_inode_info.  That's because it was still being shared with the
inline symlink.  Remove it now (saving 64 or 128 bytes from shmem inode
size), and use kmemdup() for short symlinks, say, those up to 128 bytes.

I wonder why mpol_free_shared_policy() is done in shmem_destroy_inode()
rather than shmem_evict_inode(), where we usually do such freeing? I
guess it doesn't matter, and I'm not into NUMA mpol testing right now.
