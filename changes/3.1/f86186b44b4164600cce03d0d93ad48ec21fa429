ext4: refactor duplicated block placement code

I found that ext4_ext_find_goal() and ext4_find_near()
share the same code for returning a coloured start block
based on i_block_group.

We can refactor this into a common function so that they
don't diverge in the future.

Thanks to adilger for suggesting the new function name.
