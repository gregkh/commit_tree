tmpfs: remove_shmem_readpage

Remove that pernicious shmem_readpage() at last: the things we needed it
for (splice, loop, sendfile, i915 GEM) are now fully taken care of by
shmem_file_splice_read() and shmem_read_mapping_page_gfp().

This removal clears the way for a simpler shmem_getpage_gfp(), since page
is never passed in; but leave most of that cleanup until after.

sys_readahead() and sys_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED) will now EINVAL,
instead of unexpectedly trying to read ahead on tmpfs: if that proves to
be an issue for someone, then we can either arrange for them to return
success instead, or try to implement async readahead on tmpfs.
