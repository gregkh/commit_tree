rtc: Handle errors correctly in rtc_irq_set_state()

In rtc_irq_set_state, the code checks the correctness of the parameters,
but then goes on to unconditionally arms/disarms the hrtimer. Thus a
random task might arm/disarm rtc timer and surprise the real owner by
either generating events or by stopping them.
