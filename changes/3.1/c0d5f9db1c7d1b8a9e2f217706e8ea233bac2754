libceph: initialize ack_stamp to avoid unnecessary connection reset

Commit 4cf9d544631c recorded when an outgoing ceph message was ACKed,
in order to avoid unnecessary connection resets when an OSD is busy.

However, ack_stamp is uninitialized, so there is a window between
when the message is sent and when it is ACKed in which handle_timeout()
interprets the unitialized value as an expired timeout, and resets
the connection unnecessarily.

Close the window by initializing ack_stamp.
