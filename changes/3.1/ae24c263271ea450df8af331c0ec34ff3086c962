ARM: S3C64XX: Refresh Cragganmore support

The original Cragganmore code was submitted while new code was being
refused for mainline. This patch was unexpectedly merged upstream but
development had continued in the expectation that the code would be
resubmitted later so no split patches were maintained. This patch
synchronises that work with the recently merged driver.

The main changes are fleshing out of the PMIC and audio integration for
the system, including addition of the Dallas Dhu and Tobermory audio
modules, plus some minor updates to account for revision 2 hardware.
