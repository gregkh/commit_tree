qlcnic: Add capability to take FW dump deterministically

In presence of multiple functions, current driver implementation does not
guarantee that the FW dump is taken by the same function that forces it.
Change it by adding a fw reset owner flag that could be changed in the device
reset path and only when a function determines that it needs to reset it.
