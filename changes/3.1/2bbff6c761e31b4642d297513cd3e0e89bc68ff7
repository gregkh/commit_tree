mm/mempolicy.c: make copy_from_user() provably correct

When compiling mm/mempolicy.c with struct user copy checks the following
warning is shown:

  In file included from arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h:572,
                   from include/linux/uaccess.h:5,

                   from include/linux/mempolicy.h:70,
                   from mm/mempolicy.c:68:
  In function `copy_from_user',
      inlined from `compat_sys_get_mempolicy' at mm/mempolicy.c:1415:

    LD      mm/built-in.o

Fix this by passing correct buffer size value.
