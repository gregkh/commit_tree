tmpfs: convert mem_cgroup shmem to radix-swap

Remove mem_cgroup_shmem_charge_fallback(): it was only required when we
had to move swappage to filecache with GFP_NOWAIT.

Remove the GFP_NOWAIT special case from mem_cgroup_cache_charge(), by
moving its call out from shmem_add_to_page_cache() to two of thats three
callers.  But leave it doing mem_cgroup_uncharge_cache_page() on error:
although asymmetrical, it's easier for all 3 callers to handle.

These two changes would also be appropriate if anyone were to start
using shmem_read_mapping_page_gfp() with GFP_NOWAIT.

Remove mem_cgroup_get_shmem_target(): mc_handle_file_pte() can test
radix_tree_exceptional_entry() to get what it needs for itself.
