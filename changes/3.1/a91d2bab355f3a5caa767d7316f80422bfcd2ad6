rtc: stmp3xxx: Initialize drvdata before registering device

Commit f44f7f96a20 ("RTC: Initialize kernel state from RTC") uncovered
an issue in a number of RTC drivers, where the drivers call
rtc_device_register before initializing the device or platform drvdata.

This frequently results in null pointer dereferences when the
rtc_device_register immediately makes use of the rtc device, calling
rtc_read_alarm.

The solution is to ensure the drvdata is initialized prior to registering
the rtc device.
