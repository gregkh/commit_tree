netfilter: nf_queue: reject NF_STOLEN verdicts from userspace

A userspace listener may send (bogus) NF_STOLEN verdict, which causes skb leak.

This problem was previously fixed via
64507fdbc29c3a622180378210ecea8659b14e40 (netfilter:
nf_queue: fix NF_STOLEN skb leak) but this had to be reverted because
NF_STOLEN can also be returned by a netfilter hook when iterating the
rules in nf_reinject.

Reject userspace NF_STOLEN verdict, as suggested by Michal Miroslaw.

This is complementary to commit fad54440438a7c231a6ae347738423cbabc936d9
(netfilter: avoid double free in nf_reinject).
