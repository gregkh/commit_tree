HID: magicmouse: ignore 'ivalid report id' while switching modes, v2

This is basically a more generic respin of 23746a6 ("HID: magicmouse: ignore
'ivalid report id' while switching modes") which got reverted later by
c3a492.

It turns out that on some configurations, this is actually still the case
and we are not able to detect in runtime.

The device reponds with 'invalid report id' when feature report switching it
into multitouch mode is sent to it.

This has been silently ignored before 0825411ade ("HID: bt: Wait for ACK
on Sent Reports"), but since this commit, it propagates -EIO from the _raw
callback .

So let the driver ignore -EIO as response to 0xd7,0x01 report, as that's
how the device reacts in normal mode.

Sad, but following reality.
