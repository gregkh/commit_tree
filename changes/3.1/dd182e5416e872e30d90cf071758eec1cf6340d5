[media] uvcvideo: Set alternate setting 0 on resume if the bus has been reset

If the bus has been reset on resume, set the alternate setting to 0.
This should be the default value, but some devices crash or otherwise
misbehave if they don't receive a SET_INTERFACE request before any other
video control request.

Microdia's 0c45:6437 camera has been found to require this change or it
will stop sending video data after resume.
