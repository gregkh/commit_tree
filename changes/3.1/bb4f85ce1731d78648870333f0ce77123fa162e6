ps3_gelic: Fix start_xmit kick error path

Revert to a proper state when gelic_card_kick_txdma() fails:
- Don't trigger BUG_ON when releasing the unsent tx descriptor
- Reset the tx chain head since the tail was not modified and
  hence not in sync
- Unlink the released descriptor bus address from its predecessor
