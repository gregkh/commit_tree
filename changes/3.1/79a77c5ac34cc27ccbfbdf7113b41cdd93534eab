ext4: prevent memory leaks from ext4_mb_init_backend() on error path

In ext4_mb_init(), if the s_locality_group allocation fails it will
currently cause the allocations made in ext4_mb_init_backend() to
be leaked.  Moving the ext4_mb_init_backend() allocation after the
s_locality_group allocation avoids that problem.
