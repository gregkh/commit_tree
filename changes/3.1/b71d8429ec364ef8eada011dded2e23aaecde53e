mach-integrator: fix VGA base regression

"ARM: set vga memory base at run-time"

Makes the Integrator/AP freeze completely. I appears that
this is due to the VGA base address being assigned at PCI
init time, while this base is needed earlier than that.
Moving the initialization of the base address to the
.map_io function solves this problem.
