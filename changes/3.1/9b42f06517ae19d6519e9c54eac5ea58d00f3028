trivial: don't touch files that are removed in the staging tree

This is a partial revert of e44ba033c565 ("treewide: remove duplicate
includes") and 28f65c11f2ff ("treewide: Convert uses of struct resource
to resource_size(ptr)") as the files in question have been removed in
staging tree, so get rid of the conflict.
