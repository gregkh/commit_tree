ALSA: hdspm - Fix reported external sample rate on RME MADI and MADIface

In slave mode, the card can only detect the base frequency (32..48kHz)
on the MADI link (exception: 96k frames), so the real external sample
rate is this base frequency multiplied by 1, 2 or 4 depending on the
speed mode.

This patch enables 64..192kHz sample rates in clock slave mode, which
failed before due to an alleged sample rate mismatch between the MADI
link (e.g., 48kHz) and the application in DS/QS mode (e.g., 96kHz,
192kHz).
