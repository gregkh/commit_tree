KVM: PPC: booke: use shadow_msr

Keep the guest MSR and the guest-mode true MSR separate, rather than
modifying the guest MSR on each guest entry to produce a true MSR.

Any bits which should be modified based on guest MSR must be explicitly
propagated from vcpu->arch.shared->msr to vcpu->arch.shadow_msr in
kvmppc_set_msr().

While we're modifying the guest entry code, reorder a few instructions
to bury some load latencies.
