include/linux/ioport.h: new helper to define common struct resource constructs

Resource definitions that just define start, end and flags =
IORESOURCE_MEM or IORESOURCE_IRQ (with start=end) are quite common.  So
introduce a shortcut for them.  For completeness add macros for
IORESOURCE_DMA and IORESOURCE_IO, too and also make available a set of
macros to specify named resources of all types which are less common.
