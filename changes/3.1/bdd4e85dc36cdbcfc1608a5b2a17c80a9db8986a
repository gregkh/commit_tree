sched: Isolate preempt counting in its own config option

Create a new CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT that handles the inc/dec
of preempt count offset independently. So that the offset
can be updated by preempt_disable() and preempt_enable()
even without the need for CONFIG_PREEMPT beeing set.

This prepares to make CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP working
with !CONFIG_PREEMPT where it currently doesn't detect
code that sleeps inside explicit preemption disabled
sections.
