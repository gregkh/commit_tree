ext4: fix a race which could leak memory in ext4_groupinfo_create_slab()

In ext4_groupinfo_create_slab, we create ext4_groupinfo_caches within
ext4_grpinfo_slab_create_mutex, but set it outside the lock, and there
does exist some case that we may create it twice and causes a memory
leak.  So set it before we call mutex_unlock.
