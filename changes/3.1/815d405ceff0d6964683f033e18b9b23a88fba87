VFS: Fix the remaining automounter semantics regressions

The concensus seems to be that system calls such as stat() etc should
not trigger an automount.  Neither should the l* versions.

This patch therefore adds a LOOKUP_AUTOMOUNT flag to tag those lookups
that _should_ trigger an automount on the last path element.

[ Edited to leave out the cases that are already covered by LOOKUP_OPEN,
  LOOKUP_DIRECTORY and LOOKUP_CREATE - all of which also fundamentally
  force automounting for their own reasons   - Linus ]
