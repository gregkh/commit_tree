KVM: PPC: e500: Support large page mappings of PFNMAP vmas.

This allows large pages to be used on guest mappings backed by things like
/dev/mem, resulting in a significant speedup when guest memory
is mapped this way (it's useful for directly-assigned MMIO, too).

This is not a substitute for hugetlbfs integration, but is useful for
configurations where devices are directly assigned on chips without an
IOMMU -- in these cases, we need guest physical and true physical to
match, and be contiguous, so static reservation and mapping via /dev/mem
is the most straightforward way to set things up.
