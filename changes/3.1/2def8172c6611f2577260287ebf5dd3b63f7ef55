ALSA: hda: hdmi_eld_update_pcm_info: update a stream in place

A future change won't store an entire hda_pcm_stream just to represent
the capabilities of a codec; a custom data-structure will be used. To
ease that transition, modify hdmi_eld_update_pcm_info to expect the
hda_pcm_stream to be pre-initialized with the codec's capabilities, and
to update those capabilities in-place based on the ELD.
