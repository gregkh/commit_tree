perf script: "sym" field really means show IP data

Currently the "sym" output field is used to dump instruction pointers
and callchain stack. Sample addresses can also be converted to symbols,
so the meaning of "sym" needs to be fixed. This patch adds an "ip"
option and if it is selected the user can also opt to dump symbols for
them. If the user opts to dump IP without syms only the address is
shown.
