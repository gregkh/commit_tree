[media] drxk: Fix the logic that selects between DVB-C annex A and C

Fix the DRX-K logic that selects between DVB-C annex A and C

Fix a typo where DVB-C annex type is set via setEnvParameters, but
the driver, uses, instead, setParamParameters[2].

While here, cleans up the code, fixing a bad identation at the fallback
code for other types of firmware, and put the multiple-line comments
into the Linux CodingStyle.
