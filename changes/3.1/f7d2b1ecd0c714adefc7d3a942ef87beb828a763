writeback: account per-bdi accumulated written pages

Introduce the BDI_WRITTEN counter. It will be used for estimating the
bdi's write bandwidth.

Peter Zijlstra <a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl>:
Move BDI_WRITTEN accounting into __bdi_writeout_inc().
This will cover and fix fuse, which only calls bdi_writeout_inc().
