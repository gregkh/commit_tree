mmc: block: add member in mmc queue struct to hold request data

The way the request data is organized in the mmc queue struct, it only
allows processing of one request at a time.  This patch adds a new struct
to hold mmc queue request data such as sg list, request, blk request and
bounce buffers, and updates any functions depending on the mmc queue
struct. This prepares for using multiple active requests in one mmc queue.
