shm: optimize locking and ipc_namespace getting

shm_lock() does a lookup of shm segment in shm_ids(ns).ipcs_idr, which
is redundant as we already know shmid_kernel address.  An actual lock is
also not required for reads until we really want to destroy the segment.

exit_shm() and shm_destroy_orphaned() may avoid the loop by checking
whether there is at least one segment in current ipc_namespace.

The check of nsproxy and ipc_ns against NULL is redundant as exit_shm()
is called from do_exit() before the call to exit_notify(), so the
dereferencing current->nsproxy->ipc_ns is guaranteed to be safe.
