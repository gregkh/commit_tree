USB: net2272: driver for PLX NET2272 USB device controller

This is based on the last release from PLX:
	http://www.plxtech.com/files/products/net2000/software/selectiontool/RE061204-net2272-linux2.6.18.tgz

I've managed to contact them and they've confirmed that this driver was
wholly written by PLX (Seth Levy).  While they have no problem with it
being merged (and they've already licensed it as GPL), they don't have
any interest in doing so themselves as this is an old part for them.

ADI has long had an add-on card which has this part on it, so we've been
keeping it up-to-date out of tree.  But now that PLX has confirmed the
source of the driver, we can can take the next step of cleaning it up and
getting it merged.

So here we are!  I've done quite a large clean up of the driver and
attempted to address all the common issues.  Hopefully in the process,
I haven't broken anything.  While it seems to still work with the board
that I have access to, it is not a PCI variant.  So I have not tested
any of the PCI logic myself (beyond clean compile).  Perhaps someone who
actually has a card and cares can do so.

I'll try to address further feedback, but don't expect miracles.  I'm
not really familiar with the part itself, just the platform glue.
