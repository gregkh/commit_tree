NFS: pnfs IPv6 support

Handle ipv6 remote addresses from GETDEVICEINFO

 - supports netid "tcp" for ipv4 and "tcp6" for ipv6 as rfc 5665 specifies
 - added ds_remotestr to avoid having to handle different AFs in every dprintk
 - tested against pynfs 4.1 server, submitting ipv6 support patch to pynfs
 - tested with IPv6 disabled, it compiles cleanly and relies on rpc_pton to
   refuse to accept IPv6 addresses
