MIPS: tlbex: Fix build error in R3000 code.

Only some GCC versions such as gcc 4.2 notice that the variable wr in
build_r3000_tlb_modify_handler is used uninitialized.  When using one
of those GCCs the build will fail due to -Werror.  GCC 4.6 does not
warn about the uninitialized use of wr.

This issue was introduced by 7211f4d7a3dcbe57c5d396c334dca525315dceb2
