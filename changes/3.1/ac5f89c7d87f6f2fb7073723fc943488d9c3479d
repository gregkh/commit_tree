powerpc: Add jump label support

This patch adds support for the new "jump label" feature.

Unlike x86 and sparc we just merrily patch the code with no locks etc,
as far as I know this is safe, but I'm not really sure what the x86/sparc
code is protecting against so maybe it's not.

I also don't see any reason for us to implement the poke_early() routine,
even though sparc does.
