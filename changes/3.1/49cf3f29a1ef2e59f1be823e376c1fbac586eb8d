i8253: Consolidate definitions of PIT_LATCH

x86 defines PIT_LATCH as LATCH which in <linux/timex.h> is defined as
((CLOCK_TICK_RATE + HZ/2) / HZ) and <asm/timex.h> again defines
CLOCK_TICK_RATE as PIT_TICK_RATE.

MIPS defines PIT_LATCH as LATCH which in <linux/timex.h> is defined as
((CLOCK_TICK_RATE + HZ/2) / HZ) and <asm/timex.h> again defines
CLOCK_TICK_RATE as 1193182.

ARM defines PITCH_LATCH as ((PIT_TICK_RATE + HZ / 2) / HZ) - and that's
the sanest thing and equivalent to above definitions so use that as the
new definition in <linux/i8253.h>.
