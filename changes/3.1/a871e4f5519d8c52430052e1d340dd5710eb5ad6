USB: usb-storage: unusual_devs entry for ARM V2M motherboard.

Connecting the V2M to a Linux host results in a constant stream of
errors spammed to the console, all of the form

  sd 1:0:0:0: ioctl_internal_command return code = 8070000
     : Sense Key : 0x4 [current]
     : ASC=0x0 ASCQ=0x0

The errors appear to be otherwise harmless.  Add an unusual_devs entry
which eliminates all of the error messages.
