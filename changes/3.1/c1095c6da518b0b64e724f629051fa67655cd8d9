signals: sys_ssetmask/sys_rt_sigsuspend should use set_current_blocked()

sys_ssetmask(), sys_rt_sigsuspend() and compat_sys_rt_sigsuspend()
change ->blocked directly.  This is not correct, see the changelog in
e6fa16ab "signal: sigprocmask() should do retarget_shared_pending()"

Change them to use set_current_blocked().

Another change is that now we are doing ->saved_sigmask = ->blocked
lockless, it doesn't make any sense to do this under ->siglock.
