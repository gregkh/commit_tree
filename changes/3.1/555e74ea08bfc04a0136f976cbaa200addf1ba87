OMAP2+: clockdomain: Add per clkdm lock to prevent concurrent state programming

Since the clkdm state programming is now done from within the hwmod
framework (which uses a per-hwmod lock) instead of the being done
from the clock framework (which used a global lock), there is now a
need to have per-clkdm locking to prevent races between different
hwmods/modules belonging to the same clock domain concurrently
programming the clkdm state.
