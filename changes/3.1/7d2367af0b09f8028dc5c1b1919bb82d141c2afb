checkpatch: suggest using min_t or max_t

A common issue with min() or max() is using a cast on one or both of the
arguments when using min_t/max_t could be better.

Add cast detection to uses of min/max and suggest an appropriate use of
min_t or max_t instead.

Caveat:  This only works for min() or max() on a single line.
         It does not find min() or max() split across multiple lines.

This does find:
	min((u32)foo, bar);
But it does not find:
	max((unsigned long)foo,
	    bar);
