tmpfs: refine shmem_file_splice_read

Tidy up shmem_file_splice_read():

Remove readahead: okay, we could implement shmem readahead on swap,
but have never done so before, swap being the slow exceptional path.

Use shmem_getpage() instead of find_or_create_page() plus ->readpage().

Remove several comments: sorry, I found them more distracting than
helpful, and this will not be the reference version of splice_read().
