md: load/store badblock list from v1.x metadata

Space must have been allocated when array was created.
A feature flag is set when the badblock list is non-empty, to
ensure old kernels don't load and trust the whole device.

We only update the on-disk badblocklist when it has changed.
If the badblocklist (or other metadata) is stored on a bad block, we
don't cope very well.

If metadata has no room for bad block, flag bad-blocks as disabled,
and do the same for 0.90 metadata.
