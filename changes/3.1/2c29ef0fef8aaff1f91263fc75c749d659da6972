perf: Simplify and fix __perf_install_in_context()

Currently __perf_install_in_context() will try and schedule in the
event irrespective of our event scheduling rules, that is, we try to
schedule CPU-pinned, TASK-pinned, CPU-flexible, TASK-flexible, but
when creating a new event we simply try and schedule it on top of
whatever is already on the PMU, this can lead to errors for pinned
events.

Therefore, simplify things and simply schedule everything out, add the
event to the corresponding context and schedule everything back in.

This also nicely handles the case where with
__ARCH_WANT_INTERRUPTS_ON_CTXSW the IPI can come right in the middle
of schedule, before we managed to call perf_event_task_sched_in().
