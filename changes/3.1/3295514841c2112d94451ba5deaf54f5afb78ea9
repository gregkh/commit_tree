fix rcu annotations noise in cred.h

task->cred is declared as __rcu, and access to other tasks' ->cred is,
indeed, protected.  Access to current->cred does not need rcu_dereference()
at all, since only the task itself can change its ->cred.  sparse, of
course, has no way of knowing that...

Add force-cast in current_cred(), make current_fsuid() et.al. use it.
