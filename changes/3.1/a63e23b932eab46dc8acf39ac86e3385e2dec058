powerpc/85xx: fix mpic configuration in CAMP mode

Change the string to check for CAMP mode boot on MPC85xx (eg. P2020) to match
the one in the corresponding dts files (p2020rdb_camp_core{0,1}.dts).

Without this fix the mpic is configured as in the SMP boot mode, which causes
the first core to report a protected source interrupt error for devices
of the other core and lock up.

Also add MPIC_SINGLE_DEST_CPU on both P2020 based architectures in CAMP
mode as suggested by Scott Wood. Thanks.
