MIPS: Compat: Use 32-bit wrapper for compat_sys_futex.

We can't trust userspace to pass signed-extend arguments.  Not correctly
sign-extended arguments to futex-wait result in architecturally undefined
operation of 32-bit arithmetic instructions.

For example, if 'val' is too big and bit-31 is 1, the caller may enter
endless loop at:

futex_wait_setup()
{
	...

	if (uval != val) {
		queue_unlock(q, *hb);
		ret = -EWOULDBLOCK;

	...
}
