x86, mtrr: use stop_machine APIs for doing MTRR rendezvous

MTRR rendezvous sequence is not implemened using stop_machine() before, as this
gets called both from the process context aswell as the cpu online paths
(where the cpu has not come online and the interrupts are disabled etc).

Now that we have a new stop_machine_from_inactive_cpu() API, use it for
rendezvous during mtrr init of a logical processor that is coming online.

For the rest (runtime MTRR modification, system boot, resume paths), use
stop_machine() to implement the rendezvous sequence. This will consolidate and
cleanup the code.
