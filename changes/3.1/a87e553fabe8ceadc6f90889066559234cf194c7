asm-generic: delay.h fix udelay and ndelay for 8 bit args

With a non-constant 8-bit argument, a call to udelay() generates a warning:

drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/atom.c: In function 'atom_op_delay':
drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/atom.c:654: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type

The code looks like it works OK with an 8-bit arg, and the calling code is
doing nothing wrong, so udelay() needs fixing.

Fixing it was rather tricky.  Simply typecasting `n' in the comparison with
20000 didn't change anything.  Hence the divide-by-20000 trick.

Using a do{}while loop didn't work because udelay() is used in ?: statements,
hence the ({...}) construct.

While I was there I replaced the brain-bending ?:?:?: mess with nice if/else
code.

Probably other architectures are generating the same warning and can use a
similar change.
