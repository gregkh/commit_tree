ARM: 7065/1: kexec: ensure new kernel is entered in ARM state

Commit 540b5738 ("ARM: 6999/1: head, zImage: Always Enter the kernel in
ARM state") mandates that the kernel should be entered in ARM state.

If a Thumb-2 kernel kexecs a new kernel image, we need to ensure that
we change state when branching to the new code. This patch replaces a
mov pc, lr with a bx lr on Thumb-2 kernels so that we transition to ARM
state if need be.
