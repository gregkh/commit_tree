PM / Runtime: Add new helper function: pm_runtime_status_suspended()

This boolean function simply returns whether or not the runtime status
of the device is 'suspended'.  Unlike pm_runtime_suspended(), this
function returns the runtime status whether or not runtime PM for the
device has been disabled or not.

Also add entry to Documentation/power/runtime.txt
