mmc: mmc_test: add test for non-blocking transfers

Add four tests for read and write performance per
different transfer size, 4k to 4M.
 * Read using blocking mmc request
 * Read using non-blocking mmc request
 * Write using blocking mmc request
 * Write using non-blocking mmc request

The host driver must support pre_req() and post_req()
in order to run the non-blocking test cases.
