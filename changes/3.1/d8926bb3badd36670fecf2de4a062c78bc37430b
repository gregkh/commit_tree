btrfs: don't BUG_ON btrfs_alloc_path() errors

This patch fixes many callers of btrfs_alloc_path() which BUG_ON allocation
failure. All the sites that are fixed in this patch were checked by me to
be fairly trivial to fix because of at least one of two criteria:

 - Callers of the function catch errors from it already so bubbling the
   error up will be handled.
 - Callers of the function might BUG_ON any nonzero return code in which
   case there is no behavior changed (but we still got to remove a BUG_ON)

The following functions were updated:

btrfs_lookup_extent, alloc_reserved_tree_block, btrfs_remove_block_group,
btrfs_lookup_csums_range, btrfs_csum_file_blocks, btrfs_mark_extent_written,
btrfs_inode_by_name, btrfs_new_inode, btrfs_symlink,
insert_reserved_file_extent, and run_delalloc_nocow
