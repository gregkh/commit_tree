time: Fix stupid KERN_WARN compile issue

Terribly embarassing. Don't know how I committed this, but its
KERN_WARNING not KERN_WARN.

This fixes the following compile error:
kernel/time/timekeeping.c: In function ‘__timekeeping_inject_sleeptime’:
kernel/time/timekeeping.c:608: error: ‘KERN_WARN’ undeclared (first use in this function)
kernel/time/timekeeping.c:608: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
kernel/time/timekeeping.c:608: error: for each function it appears in.)
kernel/time/timekeeping.c:608: error: expected ‘)’ before string constant
make[2]: *** [kernel/time/timekeeping.o] Error 1
