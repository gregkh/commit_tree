powerpc/85xx: Cleanup PCIe support on corenet_ds boards

Several changes on PCIe support on P3041DS/P4080DS/P5020DS boards:
* Add support for "fsl,qoriq-pcie-v2.2" needed by P3041 & P5020
* Removed support for setting primary_phb_addr as we have no ISA need
* Add PCI controller to of_platform_bus_probe (for EDAC)
* Cleanup building w/SWIOTLB off on P4080DS (not stricly PCIe related)
