ARM: entry: no need to increase preempt count for IRQ handlers

irq_enter() and irq_exit() already take care of the preempt_count
handling for interrupts, which increment and decrement the hardirq
bits of the preempt count.  So we can remove the preempt count handing
in our IRQ entry/exit assembly, like x86 did some 9 years ago.
