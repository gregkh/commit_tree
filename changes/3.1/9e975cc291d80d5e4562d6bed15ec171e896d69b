tg3: Fix io failures after chip reset

Commit f2096f94b514d88593355995d5dd276961e88af1, entitled
"tg3: Add 5720 H2BMC support", needed to add code to preserve some bits
set by firmware.  Unfortunately the new code causes throughput to stop
after a chip reset because it enables state machines before they are
ready.  This patch undoes the problematic code.  The bits will be
restored later in the init sequence.
