xen/pciback: Have 'passthrough' option instead of XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_PASS and XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_VPCI

.. compile options. This way the user can decide during runtime whether they
want the default 'vpci' (virtual pci passthrough) or where the PCI devices
are passed in without any BDF renumbering. The option 'passthrough' allows
the user to toggle the it from 0 (vpci) to 1 (passthrough).
