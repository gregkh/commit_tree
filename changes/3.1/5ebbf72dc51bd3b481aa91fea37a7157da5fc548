[media] OMAP_VOUT: Fix build break caused by update_mode removal in DSS2

The DSS2 driver does not support the configuration of the update_mode of a
panel anymore. Remove the setting of update_mode done in omap_vout_probe().
Ignore configuration of TE since omap_vout driver doesn't support manual update
displays anyway.
