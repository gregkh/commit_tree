asm-generic: adapt delay.h to common implementation

Several architectures are using a common delay.h implementation that
appears to have originated with the x86 architecture.  This common
implementation is a bit fuller than the current asm-generic version
and has some compile-time checks that should be interesting for all
architectures.

This patch takes the common delay.h version and replaces the rather
trivial asm-generic version with it.  As no architecture was actually
using asm-generic/delay.h, this change is rather innocuous; it will,
however, allow us to switch at least four architectures over to using
the asm-generic version.
