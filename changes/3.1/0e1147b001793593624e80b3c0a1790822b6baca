ext4: add action of moving index in ext4_ext_rm_idx for Punch Hole

The old function ext4_ext_rm_idx is used only for truncate case
because it just remove last index in extent-index-block. When punching
hole, it usually needed to remove "middle" index, therefore we must
move indexes which after it forward.

(I create a file with 1 depth extent tree and punch hole in the middle
of it, the last index in index-block strangly gone, so I find out this
bug)
