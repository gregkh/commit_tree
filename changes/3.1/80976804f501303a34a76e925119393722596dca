staging: zcache: fix cleancache crash

After commit c5f5c4db3938 ("staging: zcache: fix crash on high memory
swap") cleancache crashes on the first successful get.  This was caused
by a remaining virt_to_page() call in zcache_pampd_get_data_and_free()
that only gets run in the cleancache path.

The patch converts the virt_to_page() to struct page casting like was
done for other instances in c5f5c4db3938.
