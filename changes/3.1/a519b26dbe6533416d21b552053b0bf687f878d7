md: remove suspicious size_of()

When calling bioset_create we pass the size of the front_pad as
   sizeof(mddev)
which looks suspicious as mddev is a pointer and so it looks like a
common mistake where
   sizeof(*mddev)
was intended.
The size is actually correct as we want to store a pointer in the
front padding of the bios created by the bioset, so make the intent
more explicit by using
   sizeof(mddev_t *)
