base/devres.c: quiet sparse noise about context imbalance

devres_release_all and devres_release_group both aquire the lock
&dev->devres_lock but the release of that lock is done in release_nodes.
This results in sparse noise about context imbalance.

Add a lock annotation to release_nodes to quiet this noise.
