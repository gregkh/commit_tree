block: eliminate potential for infinite loop in blkdev_issue_discard

Due to the recently identified overflow in read_capacity_16() it was
possible for max_discard_sectors to be zero but still have discards
enabled on the associated device's queue.

Eliminate the possibility for blkdev_issue_discard to infinitely loop.

Interestingly this issue wasn't identified until a device, whose
discard_granularity was 0 due to read_capacity_16 overflow, was consumed
by blk_stack_limits() to construct limits for a higher-level DM
multipath device.  The multipath device's resulting limits never had the
discard limits stacked because blk_stack_limits() will only do so if
the bottom device's discard_granularity != 0.  This resulted in the
multipath device's limits.max_discard_sectors being 0.
