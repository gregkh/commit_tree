Btrfs: fix the file extent gap when doing direct IO

When we write some data to the place that is beyond the end of the file
in direct I/O mode, a data hole will be created. And Btrfs should insert
a file extent item that point to this hole into the fs tree. But unfortunately
Btrfs forgets doing it.

The following is a simple way to reproduce it:
 # mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdc2
 # mount /dev/sdc2 /test4
 # touch /test4/a
 # dd if=/dev/zero of=/test4/a seek=8 count=1 bs=4K oflag=direct conv=nocreat,notrunc
 # umount /test4
 # btrfsck /dev/sdc2
 root 5 inode 257 errors 100
