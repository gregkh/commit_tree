ALSA: hda - Fix volume-init for ALC259 with invalid widget caps

ALC259 seems to provide an invalid widget capability for the input-src
selector widget.  The widget shows the input-amp while it's a selector,
and this confuses the current ALC882 initialization code that is used
for ALC259, too.  For fixing this, check the amp capability and handle
the connection selection individually.

Also, ALC259 has no mute bit in DAC volume, so we need to initialize
it as ZERO instead of MUTE.
