xen/smp: Warn user why they keel over - nosmp or noapic and what to use instead.

We have hit a couple of customer bugs where they would like to
use those parameters to run an UP kernel - but both of those
options turn of important sources of interrupt information so
we end up not being able to boot. The correct way is to
pass in 'dom0_max_vcpus=1' on the Xen hypervisor line and
the kernel will patch itself to be a UP kernel.
