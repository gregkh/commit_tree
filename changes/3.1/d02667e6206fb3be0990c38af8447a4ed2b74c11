ALSA: hda - Fix invalid mute led state on resume of IDT codecs

Codec state is not restored immediately on resume but on the first
access when power-save is enabled.  That leads to an invalid mute led
state after resume until either sound is played or some control is
changed.  This patch adds a possibility for a vendor specific patch to
restore codec state immediately after resume if required.  And it adds
code to restore IDT codecs state immediately on resume on HP systems
with mute led support.
