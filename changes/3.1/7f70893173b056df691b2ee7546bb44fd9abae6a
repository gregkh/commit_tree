rcu: Fix wrong check in list_splice_init_rcu()

If the list to be spliced is empty, then list_splice_init_rcu() has
nothing to do.  Unfortunately, list_splice_init_rcu() does not check
the list to be spliced; it instead checks the list to be spliced into.
This results in memory leaks given current usage.  This commit
therefore fixes the empty-list check.
