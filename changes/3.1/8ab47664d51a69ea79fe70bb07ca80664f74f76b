vfs: increase shrinker batch size

Now that the per-sb shrinker is responsible for shrinking 2 or more
caches, increase the batch size to keep econmies of scale for
shrinking each cache.  Increase the shrinker batch size to 1024
objects.

To allow for a large increase in batch size, add a conditional
reschedule to prune_icache_sb() so that we don't hold the LRU spin
lock for too long. This mirrors the behaviour of the
__shrink_dcache_sb(), and allows us to increase the batch size
without needing to worry about problems caused by long lock hold
times.

To ensure that filesystems using the per-sb shrinker callouts don't
cause problems, document that the object freeing method must
reschedule appropriately inside loops.
