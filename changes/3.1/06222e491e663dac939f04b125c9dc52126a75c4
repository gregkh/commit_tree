fs: handle SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA properly in all fs's that define their own llseek

This converts everybody to handle SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA properly.  In some cases
we just return -EINVAL, in others we do the normal generic thing, and in others
we're simply making sure that the properly due-dilligence is done.  For example
in NFS/CIFS we need to make sure the file size is update properly for the
SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA case, but since it calls the generic llseek stuff itself
that is all we have to do.  Thanks,
