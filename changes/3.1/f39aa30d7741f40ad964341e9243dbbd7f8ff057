firewire: ohci: add no MSI quirk for O2Micro controller

This fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/801719 .

An O2Micro PCI Express FireWire controller,
"FireWire (IEEE 1394) [0c00]: O2 Micro, Inc. Device [1217:11f7] (rev 05)"
which is a combination device together with an SDHCI controller and some
sort of storage controller, misses SBP-2 status writes from an attached
FireWire HDD.  This problem goes away if MSI is disabled for this
FireWire controller.

The device reportedly does not require QUIRK_CYCLE_TIMER.
