pch_dma: Fix CTL register access issue

Currently, Mode-Control register is accessed by read-modify-write.

According to DMA hardware specifications datasheet, prohibits this method.
Because this register resets to 0 by DMA HW after DMA transfer completes.
Thus, current read-modify-write processing can cause unexpected behavior.

The datasheet says in case of writing Mode-Control register, set the value for only target channel, the others must set '11b'.
e.g. Set DMA0=01b  DMA11=10b
CTL0=33333331h
CTL2=00002333h

NOTE:
CTL0 includes DMA0~7 Mode-Control register.
CTL2 includes DMA8~11 Mode-Control register.

This patch modifies the issue.
