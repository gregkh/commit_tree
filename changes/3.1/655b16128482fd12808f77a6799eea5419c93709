nfs_xdr: Move nfs4_string definition out of #ifdef CONFIG_NFS_V4

exofs file system wants to use pnfs_osd_xdr.h file instead of
redefining pnfs-objects types in it's private "pnfs.h" headr.

Before we do the switch we must make sure pnfs_osd_xdr.h is
compilable also under NFS versions smaller than 4.1. Since now
it is needed regardless of version, by the exofs code.

nfs4_string is not the only nfs4 type out in the global scope.
