serial: sh-sci: Abstract register maps.

This takes a bit of a sledgehammer to the horribly CPU subtype
ifdef-ridden header and abstracts all of the different register layouts
in to distinct types which in turn can be overriden on a per-port basis,
or permitted to default to the map matching the port type at probe time.

In the process this ultimately fixes up inumerable bugs with mismatches
on various CPU types (particularly the legacy ones that were obviously
broken years ago and no one noticed) and provides a more tightly coupled
and consolidated platform for extending and implementing generic
features.
