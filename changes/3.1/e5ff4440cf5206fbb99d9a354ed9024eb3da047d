gpio/omap: cleanup show revision, remove cpu_is checks, display only once

Remove cpu_is_* checks from gpio_show_revision() by passing in the
revision address offset from platform data.  SoCs with no revision
register (15xx, 7xx, and all MPUIOs) use -1 (actually, USHRT_MAX) to
signify no register.

While here, all GPIO banks are assumed to be the same revision, so fix
show_revision() to only show the revision for the first bank it finds.
This removes duplicate GPIO revision prints during boot.

Thanks to Charulatha V <charu@ti.com> for finding/fixing a few -1s
that were missed in the original patch.
