ASoC: twl6040: Remove pll and headset mode dependency

Remove dependency between pll (hppll, lppll) and headset power
mode (low-power, high-performance), as headset power mode can
be used with any pll.

A new control is created to allow headset power mode configuration
from userspace. Changing headset power mode during earpiece related
usecases is not propagated down to the codec as earpiece requires
HS DAC in HP mode.
