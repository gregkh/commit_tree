x86, mce, severity: Cleanup severity table

The current format of an item in this table is:
  condition(param, ..., level, message [, condition2 ...])

So we have to check both an item's head and tail to find the conditions
which match the item.

Format them in a more straight forward manner:
  item(level, message, condition [, condition2 ...])
