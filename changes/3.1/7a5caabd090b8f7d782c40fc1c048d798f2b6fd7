drivers/leds/ledtrig-timer.c: fix broken sysfs delay handling

Fix regression introduced by commit 5ada28bf7675 ("led-class: always
implement blinking") which broke sysfs delay handling by not storing the
updated value.  Consequently it was only possible to set one of the delays
through the sysfs interface as the other delay was automatically restored
to it's default value.  Reading the parameters always gave the defaults.
