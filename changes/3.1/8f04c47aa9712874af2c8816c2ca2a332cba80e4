xfs: split xfs_itruncate_finish

Split the guts of xfs_itruncate_finish that loop over the existing extents
and calls xfs_bunmapi on them into a new helper, xfs_itruncate_externs.
Make xfs_attr_inactive call it directly instead of xfs_itruncate_finish,
which allows to simplify the latter a lot, by only letting it deal with
the data fork.  As a result xfs_itruncate_finish is renamed to
xfs_itruncate_data to make its use case more obvious.

Also remove the sync parameter from xfs_itruncate_data, which has been
unessecary since the introduction of the busy extent list in 2002, and
completely dead code since 2003 when the XFS_BMAPI_ASYNC parameter was
made a no-op.

I can't actually see why the xfs_attr_inactive needs to set the transaction
sync, but let's keep this patch simple and without changes in behaviour.

Also avoid passing a useless argument to xfs_isize_check, and make it
private to xfs_inode.c.
