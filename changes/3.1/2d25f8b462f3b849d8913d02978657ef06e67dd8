Bluetooth: Add Atheros AR3012 one PID/VID supported

The new Ath3k needs to download patch and radio table,
and it keeps same PID/VID even after downloading the patch and radio
table. This patch is to use the bcdDevice (Device Release Number) to
judge whether the chip has been patched or not. The init bcdDevice
value of the chip is 0x0001, this value increases after patch and
radio table downloading.
