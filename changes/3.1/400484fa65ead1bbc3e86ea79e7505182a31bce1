e1000e: do not schedule the Tx queue until ready

Start the Tx queue when the interface is brought up in e1000e_up() but do
not schedule the queue until link is up as detected in the watchdog task
which sets netif_carrier_on.

Also flush the descriptors and clean the Tx and Rx rings before resetting
the hardware when bringing the interface down otherwise there is a small
window where the watchdog task can be triggered with netif_carrier_off
and the Tx ring not yet empty which causes an additional and unnecessary
reset.
