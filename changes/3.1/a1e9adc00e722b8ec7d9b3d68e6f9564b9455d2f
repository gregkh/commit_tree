ASoC: Support edge triggered IRQs for WM8915

Really this should be something the IRQ core can cope with for us but since
it doesn't currently do so (at least for threaded interrupts like this) do
so in the driver. This allows us to run with interrupt controllers that
only support edge triggered interrupts.
