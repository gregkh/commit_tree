[media] xc4000: pull in firmware management code from xc3028

Switch over to using the firmware management routines from the tuner-xc2028,
since that has support for scodes, etc.

This code still requires signficant cleanup, and at this point the base
firmware does not load properly (i2c write errors about 300 bytes in).
