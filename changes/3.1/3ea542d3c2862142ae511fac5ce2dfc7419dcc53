mac80211: allow drivers to access key sequence counter

In order to implement GTK rekeying, the device needs
to be able to encrypt frames with the right PN/IV and
check the PN/IV in RX frames. To be able to tell it
about all those counters, we need to be able to get
them from mac80211, this adds the required API.
