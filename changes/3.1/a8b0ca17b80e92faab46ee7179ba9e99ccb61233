perf: Remove the nmi parameter from the swevent and overflow interface

The nmi parameter indicated if we could do wakeups from the current
context, if not, we would set some state and self-IPI and let the
resulting interrupt do the wakeup.

For the various event classes:

  - hardware: nmi=0; PMI is in fact an NMI or we run irq_work_run from
    the PMI-tail (ARM etc.)
  - tracepoint: nmi=0; since tracepoint could be from NMI context.
  - software: nmi=[0,1]; some, like the schedule thing cannot
    perform wakeups, and hence need 0.

As one can see, there is very little nmi=1 usage, and the down-side of
not using it is that on some platforms some software events can have a
jiffy delay in wakeup (when arch_irq_work_raise isn't implemented).

The up-side however is that we can remove the nmi parameter and save a
bunch of conditionals in fast paths.
