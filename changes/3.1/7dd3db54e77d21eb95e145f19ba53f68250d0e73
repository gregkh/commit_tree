job control: introduce task_set_jobctl_pending()

task->jobctl currently hosts JOBCTL_STOP_PENDING and will host TRAP
pending bits too.  Setting pending conditions on a dying task may make
the task unkillable.  Currently, each setting site is responsible for
checking for the condition but with to-be-added job control traps this
becomes too fragile.

This patch adds task_set_jobctl_pending() which should be used when
setting task->jobctl bits to schedule a stop or trap.  The function
performs the followings to ease setting pending bits.

* Sanity checks.

* If fatal signal is pending or PF_EXITING is set, no bit is set.

* STOP_SIGMASK is automatically cleared if new value is being set.

do_signal_stop() and ptrace_attach() are updated to use
task_set_jobctl_pending() instead of setting STOP_PENDING explicitly.
The surrounding structures around setting are changed to fit
task_set_jobctl_pending() better but there should be no userland
visible behavior difference.
