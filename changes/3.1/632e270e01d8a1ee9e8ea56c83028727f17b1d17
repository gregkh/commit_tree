PM / Runtime: Return special error code if runtime PM is disabled

Some callers of pm_runtime_get_sync() and other runtime PM helper
functions, scsi_autopm_get_host() and scsi_autopm_get_device() in
particular, need to distinguish error codes returned when runtime PM
is disabled (i.e. power.disable_depth is nonzero for the given
device) from error codes returned in other situations.  For this
reason, make the runtime PM helper functions return -EACCES when
power.disable_depth is nonzero and ensure that this error code
won't be returned by them in any other circumstances.  Modify
scsi_autopm_get_host() and scsi_autopm_get_device() to check the
error code returned by pm_runtime_get_sync() and ignore -EACCES.
