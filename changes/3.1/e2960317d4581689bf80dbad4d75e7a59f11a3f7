ARM: kprobes: Extend arch_specific_insn to add pointer to emulated instruction

When we come to emulating Thumb instructions then, to interwork
correctly, the code on in the instruction slot must be invoked with a
function pointer which has the least significant bit set. Rather that
set this by hand in every Thumb emulation function we will add a new
field for this purpose to arch_specific_insn, called insn_fn.

This also enables us to seamlessly share emulation functions between ARM
and Thumb code.
