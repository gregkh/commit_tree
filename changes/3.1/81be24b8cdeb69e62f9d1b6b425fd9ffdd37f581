ptrace: relocate set_current_state(TASK_TRACED) in ptrace_stop()

In ptrace_stop(), after arch hook is done, the task state and jobctl
bits are updated while holding siglock.  The ordering requirement
there is that TASK_TRACED is set before JOBCTL_TRAPPING is cleared to
prevent ptracer waiting on TRAPPING doesn't end up waking up TRACED is
actually set and sees TASK_RUNNING in wait(2).

Move set_current_state(TASK_TRACED) to the top of the block and
reorganize comments.  This makes the ordering more obvious
(TASK_TRACED before other updates) and helps future updates to group
stop participation.

This patch doesn't cause any functional change.
