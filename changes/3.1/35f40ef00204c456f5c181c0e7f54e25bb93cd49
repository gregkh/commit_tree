VFS: Remove detached-dentry counter from shrink_dcache_for_umount_subtree()

Remove the detached-dentry counter from shrink_dcache_for_umount_subtree() as
the value it computes is no longer used as of commit
312d3ca856d369bb04d0443846b85b4cdde6fa8a which made the nr_dentry counters
summed per-CPU rather than global atomic.
