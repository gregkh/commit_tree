batman-adv: do_bcast has to be true for broadcast packets only

corrects a critical bug of the GW feature. This bug made all the unicast
packets destined to a GW to be sent as broadcast. This bug is present even if
the sender GW feature is configured as OFF. It's an urgent bug fix and should
be committed as soon as possible.
