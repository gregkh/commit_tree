ARM: tegra: paz00: register i2c busses

This adds support for the i2c busses on paz00. The 3rd bus is
reserved for the nvec, which acts as master and i2c-tegra has
not yet support for this kind of operation.
The sound codec (alc5632) is connected to the first bus and will
be added once the codec and glue driver is upstream.
The thermal sensor (atd7461) is connected to dvc as usual, but will
not be added now because i2c-tegra still misses probe support
(needs I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_EMUL).
