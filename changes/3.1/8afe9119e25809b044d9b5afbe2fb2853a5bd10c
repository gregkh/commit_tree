[media] media, Micronas dvb-t: Fix mem leaks, don't needlessly zero mem, fix spelling

In drivers/media/dvb/frontends/drxd_hard.c::load_firmware() I see 3
small issues:

 1) When the 'fw' variable goes out of scope we'll leak the memory
 allocated to it by request_firmware() by neglecting to call
 release_firmware().

 2) After a successful request_firmware() we allocate fw->size bytes
 of memory using kzalloc() only to immediately overwrite all that
 memory with memcpy(), so asking for zeroed memory seems like wasted
 effort - just use kmalloc().

 3) In one of the error messages "no memory" lacks a space and is
 written as "nomemory".

This patch fixes all 3 issues.
