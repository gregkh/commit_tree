xfs: fix filesystsem freeze race in xfs_trans_alloc

As pointed out by Jan xfs_trans_alloc can race with a concurrent filesystem
freeze when it sleeps during the memory allocation.  Fix this by moving the
wait_for_freeze call after the memory allocation.  This means moving the
freeze into the low-level _xfs_trans_alloc helper, which thus grows a new
argument.  Also fix up some comments in that area while at it.
