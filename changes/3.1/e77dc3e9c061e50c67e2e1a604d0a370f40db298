ceph: only queue capsnap if caps are dirty

We used to go into this branch if i_wrbuffer_ref_head was non-zero.  This
was an ancient check from before we were careful about dealing with all
kinds of caps (and not just dirty pages).  It is cleaner to only queue a
capsnap if there is an actual dirty cap.  If we are racing with...
something...we will end up here with ci->i_wrbuffer_refs but no dirty
caps.
