x86, olpc: Rename olpc-xo1 to olpc-xo1-pm

Based on earlier review comments, we'll no longer try to stick all of
our XO-1 goodies in a single driver. We'll split it into a power management
driver, and an EC/SCI driver.

As a first step, rename olpc-xo1 to olpc-xo1-pm, and make it builtin
instead of modular.
