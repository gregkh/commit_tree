ALSA: hda - More flexible dynamic-ADC switching for Realtek codecs

This patch changes the auto-parser and the auto-mic handling codes to
allow more flexible dynamic ADC-switching with Realtek codecs.

In the new code, the following strategy is taken:

- When a cap-src can't handle all input-sources, either skip it, or
  switch to the ADC-switching mode.  In ADC-switching mode, like the
  former dual-ADC mode for ALC275, it changes ADC on the fly according
  to the current input source.
- When auto-mic is possible, always assign imux.  If the mic pins are
  set statically via a quirk, rebuild imux according to the pins.
  In the auto-mic mode, the driver always changes the imux (although
  the imux isn't exposed as a mixer element).
