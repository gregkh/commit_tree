teach /proc/$pid/numa_maps about transparent hugepages

This is modeled after the smaps code.

It detects transparent hugepages and then does a single gather_stats()
for the page as a whole.  This has two benifits:
 1. It is more efficient since it does many pages in a single shot.
 2. It does not have to break down the huge page.
