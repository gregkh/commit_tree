ipc: introduce shm_rmid_forced sysctl

Add support for the shm_rmid_forced sysctl.  If set to 1, all shared
memory objects in current ipc namespace will be automatically forced to
use IPC_RMID.

The POSIX way of handling shmem allows one to create shm objects and
call shmdt(), leaving shm object associated with no process, thus
consuming memory not counted via rlimits.

With shm_rmid_forced=1 the shared memory object is counted at least for
one process, so OOM killer may effectively kill the fat process holding
the shared memory.

It obviously breaks POSIX - some programs relying on the feature would
stop working.  So set shm_rmid_forced=1 only if you're sure nobody uses
"orphaned" memory.  Use shm_rmid_forced=0 by default for compatability
reasons.

The feature was previously impemented in -ow as a configure option.
