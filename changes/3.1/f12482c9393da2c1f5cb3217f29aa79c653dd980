ARM: 6974/1: pmu: refactor reservation

Currently, PMU platform_device reservation relies on some minor abuse
of the platform_device::id field for determining the type of PMU. This
is problematic for device tree based probing, where the ID cannot be
controlled.

This patch removes reliance on the id field, and depends on each PMU's
platform driver to figure out which type it is. As all PMUs handled by
the current platform_driver name "arm-pmu" are CPU PMUs, this
convention is hardcoded. New PMU types can be supported through the use
of {of,platform}_device_id tables
