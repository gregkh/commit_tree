ARM: mach-loki: delete

This was introduced more than 3 years ago, and since then only generic
janitorial changes were made without further addition of actual support
for "real" devices.  This is therefore a cost with no benefits to keep
in the tree.  If someone wishes to revive this code, it is always
possible to retrieve it from the Git repository.
