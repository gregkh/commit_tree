efivars: fix warnings when CONFIG_PSTORE=n

drivers/firmware/efivars.c:161: warning: ‘utf16_strlen’ defined but not used
utf16_strlen() is only used inside CONFIG_PSTORE - make this "static inline"
to shut the compiler up [thanks to hpa for the suggestion].

drivers/firmware/efivars.c:602: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
Between v1 and v2 of this patch series we decided to make the "part" number
unsigned - but missed fixing the stub version of efi_pstore_write()
