dm snapshot: skip reading origin when overwriting complete chunk

If we write a full chunk in the snapshot, skip reading the origin device
because the whole chunk will be overwritten anyway.

This patch changes the snapshot write logic when a full chunk is written.
In this case:
  1. allocate the exception
  2. dispatch the bio (but don't report the bio completion to device mapper)
  3. write the exception record
  4. report bio completed

Callbacks must be done through the kcopyd thread, because callbacks must not
race with each other.  So we create two new functions:

  dm_kcopyd_prepare_callback: allocate a job structure and prepare the callback.
  (This function must not be called from interrupt context.)

  dm_kcopyd_do_callback: submit callback.
  (This function may be called from interrupt context.)

Performance test (on snapshots with 4k chunk size):
  without the patch:
    non-direct-io sequential write (dd):    17.7MB/s
    direct-io sequential write (dd):        20.9MB/s
    non-direct-io random write (mkfs.ext2): 0.44s

  with the patch:
    non-direct-io sequential write (dd):    26.5MB/s
    direct-io sequential write (dd):        33.2MB/s
    non-direct-io random write (mkfs.ext2): 0.27s
