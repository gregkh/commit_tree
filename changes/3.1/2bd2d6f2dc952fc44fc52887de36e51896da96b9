sched: Replace use of entity_key()

"entity_key()" is only used in "__enqueue_entity()" and
its only function is to subtract a tasks vruntime by
its groups minvruntime.
Before this patch a rbtree enqueue-decision is done by
comparing two tasks in the style:

	"if (entity_key(cfs_rq, se) < entity_key(cfs_rq, entry))"

which would be

	"if (se->vruntime-cfs_rq->min_vruntime < entry->vruntime-cfs_rq->min_vruntime)"

or (if reducing cfs_rq->min_vruntime out)

	"if (se->vruntime < entry->vruntime)"

which is

	"if (entity_before(se, entry))"

So we do not need "entity_key()".
If "entity_before()" is inline we will also save one subtraction (only one,
because "entity_key(cfs_rq, se)"  was cached in "key")
