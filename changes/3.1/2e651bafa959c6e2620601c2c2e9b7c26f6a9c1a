ASoC: sh: fsi: tidyup unclear variable naming

Some variables on this driver were a unclear naming,
and were different unit (byte, frame, sample).
And some functions had wrong name
(ex. it returned "sample width" but name was "fsi_get_frame_width").
This patch tidy-up this issue, and the minimum unit become "sample".
Special thanks to Takashi YOSHII.
