x86, olpc: Add XO-1 suspend/resume support

Add code needed for basic suspend/resume of the XO-1 laptop.
Based on earlier work by Jordan Crouse, Andres Salomon, and others.

This patch incorporates all earlier feedback from Thomas Gleixner. To
clarify a certain point (now more obvious in the code itself):
On resume, OpenFirmware returns execution to Linux in protected mode
with a kernel-compatible GDT already set up. The changes and
simplifications suggested have all been included.
