batman-adv: broadcast primary OGM on all active hard-interfaces

The primary interface OGM has to be broadcasted on all hard-interfaces
even if the primary interface is not the first interface (if_num = 0).
Therefore the code has to compare the originating interface with the
primary interface instead of checking the if_num.
