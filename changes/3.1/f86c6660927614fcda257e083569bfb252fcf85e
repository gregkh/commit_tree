ARM: SAMSUNG: Add clkdev infrastructure

The struct clk definition for Samsung platforms is extended to include
a instance of struct clk_lookup and a device name. When clocks are
registered using s3c24xx_register_clock function, the dev_id, con_id
and clk members are initialized with information from the struct clk
instance and struct clk_lookup member is registered.
