mm/mempolicy.c: fix pgoff in mbind vma merge

commit 9d8cebd4bcd7 ("mm: fix mbind vma merge problem") didn't really
fix the mbind vma merge problem due to wrong pgoff value passing to
vma_merge(), which made vma_merge() always return NULL.

Before the patch applied, we are getting a result like:

  addr = 0x7fa58f00c000
  [snip]
  7fa58f00c000-7fa58f00d000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
  7fa58f00d000-7fa58f00e000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
  7fa58f00e000-7fa58f00f000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0

here 7fa58f00c000->7fa58f00f000 we get 3 VMAs which are expected to be
merged described as described in commit 9d8cebd.

Re-testing the patched kernel with the reproducer provided in commit
9d8cebd, we get the correct result:

  addr = 0x7ffa5aaa2000
  [snip]
  7ffa5aaa2000-7ffa5aaa6000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
  7fffd556f000-7fffd5584000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
