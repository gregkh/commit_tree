sched: Make sleeping inside spinlock detection working in !CONFIG_PREEMPT

Select CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT when we enable the sleeping inside
spinlock detection, so that the preempt offset gets correctly
incremented/decremented from preempt_disable()/preempt_enable().

This makes the preempt count eventually working in !CONFIG_PREEMPT
when that debug option is set and thus fixes the detection of explicit
preemption disabled sections under such config. Code that sleeps
in explicitly preempt disabled section can be finally spotted
in non-preemptible kernels.
