[S390] irqs: Do not trace arch_local_{*,irq_*} functions

Do not trace arch_local_save_flags(), arch_local_irq_*() and friends.
Although they are marked inline, gcc may still make a function out of
them and add it to the pool of functions that are traced by the function
tracer. This can cause undesirable results (kernel panic, triple faults,
etc).

Add the notrace notation to prevent them from ever being traced.
