ASoC: twl6040: Move PLL selection to codec driver

It is better if the selection between the Low power,
and High performance PLL is handled within the codec
driver, not in machine driver(s) to avoid duplicated
code, and also to have consistent tracking of the selected
PLL, and the resulting differences in supported sample
rates.
