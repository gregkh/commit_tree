hwmon: New driver sch5636

This patch adds a new driver for SMSC SCH5636 Super I/O chips.
The chips include an embedded microcontroller for hardware monitoring
solutions, allowing motherboard manufacturers to create their own
custom hwmon solution based upon the SCH5636.

Currently the sch5636 driver only supports the Fujitsu Theseus SCH5636
based hwmon solution. The sch5636 driver runs a sanity check on
loading to ensure it is dealing with a Fujitsu Theseus and not with
another custom SCH5636 based hwmon solution.
