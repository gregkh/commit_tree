xen/pciback: Fine-grain the spinlocks and fix BUG: scheduling while atomic cases.

We were using coarse spinlocks that could end up with a deadlock.
This patch fixes that and makes the spinlocks much more fine-grained.

We also drop be->watchding state spinlocks as they are already
guarded by the xenwatch_thread against multiple customers. Without
that we would trigger the BUG: scheduling while atomic.
