staging: usbip: userspace: usbip_list.c: refactor local USB device listing

Combines the different list display types for local devices into one
function. Removes dependence on utils.h, which only exists as a way to
circumvent libsysfs and will be removed. The devices are now sorted as
an added benefit of this refactor.
