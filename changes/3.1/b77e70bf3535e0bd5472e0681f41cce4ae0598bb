x86, mce: Replace MCE_SELF_VECTOR by irq_work

The MCE handler uses a special vector for self IPI to invoke
post-emergency processing in an interrupt context, e.g. call an
NMI-unsafe function, wakeup loggers, schedule time-consuming work for
recovery, etc.

This mechanism is now generalized by the following commit:

So change to use provided generic mechanism.
