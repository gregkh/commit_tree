    atm: [br2684] Fix oops due to skb->dev being NULL

    It happens that if a packet arrives in a VC between the call to open it on
    the hardware and the call to change the backend to br2684, br2684_regvcc
    processes the packet and oopses dereferencing skb->dev because it is
    NULL before the call to br2684_push().

but have been introduced again with commit

    b6211ae7f2e56837c6a4849316396d1535606e90

    atm: Use SKB queue and list helpers instead of doing it by-hand.
