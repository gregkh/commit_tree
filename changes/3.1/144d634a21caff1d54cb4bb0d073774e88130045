[S390] fix s390 assembler code alignments

The alignment is missing for various global symbols in s390 assembly code.
With a recent gcc and an instruction like stgrl this can lead to a
specification exception if the instruction uses such a mis-aligned address.

Specify the alignment explicitely and while add it define __ALIGN for s390
and use the ENTRY define to save some lines of code.
