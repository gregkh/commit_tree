xfs: remove the dead QUOTADEBUG code

Remove the dead hash table test rid which has been rotting away under
QUOTADEBUG, including some code that was compiled for normal debug
builds, but not actually called without QUOTADEBUG, and enable a few
cheap debug checks that were hidden under QUOTADEBUG for normal
debug builds.
