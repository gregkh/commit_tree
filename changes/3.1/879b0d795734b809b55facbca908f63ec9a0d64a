[media] af9015: setup rc keytable for LC-Power LC-USB-DVBT

That's this tuner:

The credit card sized remote more or less works if I set remote=4,
so I added the hash to get it autodetected.  (`more or less' there
meaning sometimes buttons are `stuck on repeat', i.e. ir-keytable -t
keeps repeating the same scancode until i press another button.)
