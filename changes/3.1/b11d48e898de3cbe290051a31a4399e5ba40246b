[SCSI] lpfc: Silence DEBUG_STRICT_USER_COPY_CHECKS=y warning

Enabling DEBUG_STRICT_USER_COPY_CHECKS causes the following
warning:

In file included from arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h:573,
                 from include/linux/uaccess.h:5,
                 from include/linux/highmem.h:7,
                 from include/linux/pagemap.h:10,
                 from include/linux/blkdev.h:12,
                 from drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_debugfs.c:21:
In function 'copy_from_user':
arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess_64.h:65:
warning: call to 'copy_from_user_overflow' declared with
attribute warning: copy_from_user() buffer size is not provably
correct

presumably due to buf_size being signed causing GCC to fail to
see that buf_size can't become negative.
