ACPI: constify ops structs

Structs battery_file, acpi_dock_ops, file_operations,
thermal_cooling_device_ops, thermal_zone_device_ops, kernel_param_ops
are not changed in runtime.  It is safe to make them const.
register_hotplug_dock_device() was altered to take const "ops" argument
to respect acpi_dock_ops' const notion.
