[SCSI] bfa: Driver initialization and model description fix

- Moved FCS initialization, which internally does the im_port creation
  as well as the scsi_host creation before bfa_init.

Once the bfa_init is complete & successful:
- Reset the FCS base port cfg params such as pwwn/nwwn and setup fc host
  params - based on the values learned during the ioc getattr request.
- Change needed to support BSG commands even on bfa init failure.
- Model description fixes for Brocade adapters.
