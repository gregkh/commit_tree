xfs: flag all buffers as metadata

Now that REQ_META bios aren't treated specially in the CFQ I/O schedule
anymore, we can tag all buffers as metadata to make blktrace traces more
meaningful.  Note that we use buffers also to zero out partial blocks
in the preallocation / hole punching code, and while they operate on
data blocks the zeros written certainly aren't data.  I think this case
is borderline metadata enough to not bother special casing it.
