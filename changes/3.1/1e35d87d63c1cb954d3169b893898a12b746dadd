staging: usbip: userspace: usbip_network: rename and cleanup function

Rename tcp_connection to usbip_net_tcp_connection, which alludes to a
usbip network library that will eventually follow. The implementation
of this function has also been cleaned up.

Headers had to be adjusted due to the elimination of the old usbip.h.
