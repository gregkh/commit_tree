x86: Add support for cmpxchg_double

A simple implementation that only supports the word size and does not
have a fallback mode (would require a spinlock).

Add 32 and 64 bit support for cmpxchg_double. cmpxchg double uses
the cmpxchg8b or cmpxchg16b instruction on x86 processors to compare
and swap 2 machine words. This allows lockless algorithms to move more
context information through critical sections.

Set a flag CONFIG_CMPXCHG_DOUBLE to signal that support for double word
cmpxchg detection has been build into the kernel. Note that each subsystem
using cmpxchg_double has to implement a fall back mechanism as long as
we offer support for processors that do not implement cmpxchg_double.
