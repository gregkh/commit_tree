Btrfs: set i_size properly when fallocating and we already

xfstests exposed a problem with preallocate when it fallocates a range that
already has an extent.  We don't set the new i_size properly because we see that
we already have an extent.  This isn't right and we should update i_size if the
space already exists.  With this patch we now pass xfstests 075.  Thanks,
