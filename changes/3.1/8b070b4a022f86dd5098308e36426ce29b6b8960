[SCSI] bfa: Brocade-1860 Fabric Adapter 16Gbs support and flash controller fixes.

- Added support for 16Gbps.
- Added logic to flush pending mailbox command queue when IOC is disabled.
- Fix to Halt the flash controller during fw initialization - since
  when asic blck is programmed flash controller's continuous access
  blocks f/w access to flash.
- Added new asic based card types and modified IOC get card model routine.
- Added PLL init fix to do LPU reset every time we do a memory
  initialization, since not doing so will cause LPU to be
  uninitialized during driver load.
- Added fix to Halt flash controller before PLL initialization.
