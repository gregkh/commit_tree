ceph: fix ceph_lookup_open intent usage

We weren't properly calling lookup_instantiate_filp when setting up the
lookup intent, which could lead to file leakage on errors.  So:

 - use separate helper for the hidden snapdir translation, immediately
   following the mds request
 - use ceph_finish_lookup for the final dentry/return value dance in the
   exit path
 - lookup_instantiate_filp on success
