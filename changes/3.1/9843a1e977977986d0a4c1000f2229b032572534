__ptrace_detach: avoid task_detached(), check do_notify_parent()

__ptrace_detach() relies on the current obscure behaviour of
do_notify_parent(tsk) which changes tsk->exit_signal if this child
should be silently reaped. That is why we check task_detached(), it
is true if the task is sub-thread, or it is the group_leader but
its exit_signal was changed by do_notify_parent().

This is confusing, change the code to rely on !thread_group_leader()
or the value returned by do_notify_parent().
