xen/pciback: Register the owner (domain) of the PCI device.

When the front-end and back-end start negotiating we register
the domain that will use the PCI device. Furthermore during shutdown
of guest or unbinding of the PCI device (and unloading of module)
from pciback we unregister the domain owner.
