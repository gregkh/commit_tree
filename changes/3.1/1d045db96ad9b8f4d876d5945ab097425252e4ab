ALSA: hda - Split quirk codes from patch_realtek.c

Put the all static quirk codes out of patch_realtek.c, split into the
file for each codec model.  For controlling the build of quirk codes,
a new Kconfig, CONFIG_SND_HDA_ENABLE_REALTEK_QUIRKS is introduced.
By setting this off, all quirk codes won't be built, thus you can save
lots of memory.

The codes in patch_realtek.c are also shuffled and more comments are
given, but the contents aren't changed.  This is just a refactoring.
