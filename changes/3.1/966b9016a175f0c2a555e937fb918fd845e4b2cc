staging: zcache: support multiple clients, prep for KVM and RAMster

This is version 3 of an update to zcache, incorporating feedback from the list.
This patch adds support to the in-kernel transcendent memory ("tmem") code
and the zcache driver for multiple clients, which will be needed for both
RAMster and KVM support.  It also adds additional tmem callbacks to support
RAMster and corresponding no-op stubs in the zcache driver.  In v2, I've
also taken the liberty of adding some additional sysfs variables to
both surface information and allow policy control.  Those experimenting
with zcache should find them useful.  V3 clarifies some code walking
and declaring arrays.
