dm flakey: support feature args

Add the ability to specify arbitrary feature flags when creating a
flakey target.  This code uses the same target argument helpers that
the multipath target does.

Also remove the superfluous 'dm-flakey' prefixes from the error messages,
as they already contain the prefix 'flakey'.
