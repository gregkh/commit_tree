HID: usbhid: Add support for SiGma Micro chip

Patch to add SiGma Micro-based keyboards (1c4f:0002) to hid-quirks.

These keyboards dont seem to allow the records to be initialized, and hence a
timeout occurs when the usbhid driver attempts to initialize them. The patch
just adds the signature for these keyboards to the hid-quirks list with the
setting HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS. This removes the 5-10 second wait for the
timeout to occur.
