ARM: 7010/1: mm: fix invalid loop for poison_init_mem

poison_init_mem() used a loop of:

	while ((count = count - 4))

which has 2 problems - an off by one error so that we do one less word
than we should, and the other is that if count == 0 then we loop forever
and poison too much.  On a platform with HAVE_TCM=y but nothing in the
TCM's, this caused corruption and the platform failed to boot.
