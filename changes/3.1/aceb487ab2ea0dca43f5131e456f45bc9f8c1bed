ARM: kprobes: Add Thumb breakpoint support

Extend the breakpoint insertion and catching functions to support Thumb
code.

As breakpoints are no longer of a fixed size, the flush_insns macro
is modified to take a size argument instead of an instruction count.

Note, we need both 16- and 32-bit Thumb breakpoints, because if we
were to use a 16-bit breakpoint to replace a 32-bit instruction which
was in an IT block, and the condition check failed, then the breakpoint
may not fire (it's unpredictable behaviour) and the CPU could then try
and execute the second half of the 32-bit Thumb instruction.
