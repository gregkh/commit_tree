rtc-omap: fix initialization of control register

As the comment explains, the intention of the code is to clear the
OMAP_RTC_CTRL_MODE_12_24 bit, but instead it only clears the
OMAP_RTC_CTRL_SPLIT and OMAP_RTC_CTRL_AUTO_COMP bits, which should be
kept.  OMAP_RTC_CTRL_DISABLE, OMAP_RTC_CTRL_SET_32_COUNTER,
OMAP_RTC_CTRL_TEST, and OMAP_RTC_CTRL_ROUND_30S are also better off
being cleared.
