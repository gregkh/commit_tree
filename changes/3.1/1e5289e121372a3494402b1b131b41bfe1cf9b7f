tcp: properly update lost_cnt_hint during shifting

lost_skb_hint is used by tcp_mark_head_lost() to mark the first unhandled skb.
lost_cnt_hint is the number of packets or sacked packets before the lost_skb_hint;
When shifting a skb that is before the lost_skb_hint, if tcp_is_fack() is ture,
the skb has already been counted in the lost_cnt_hint; if tcp_is_fack() is false,
tcp_sacktag_one() will increase the lost_cnt_hint. So tcp_shifted_skb() does not
need to adjust the lost_cnt_hint by itself. When shifting a skb that is equal to
lost_skb_hint, the shifted packets will not be counted by tcp_mark_head_lost().
So tcp_shifted_skb() should adjust the lost_cnt_hint even tcp_is_fack(tp) is true.
