UBI: use debugfs for the extra checks knobs

This patch introduces debugfs support to UBI. All the UBI stuff is kept in the
"ubi" debugfs directory, which contains per-UBI device "ubi/ubiX"
sub-directories, containing debugging files. This file also creates
"ubi/ubiX/chk_gen" and "ubi/ubiX/chk_io" knobs for switching general and I/O
extra checks on and off. And it removes the 'debug_chks' UBI module parameters.
