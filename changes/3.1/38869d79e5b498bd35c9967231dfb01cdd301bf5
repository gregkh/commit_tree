mwifiex: fix minor issue in debugfs command 'info'

Debugfs command 'info' shows wrong interface type. The regression
occurred due to commit eecd8250e (mwifiex: remove MWIFIEX_BSS_MODE_
macros) in which we replaced MWIFIEX_BSS_MODE_* macros by
NL80211_IFTYPE_*, for example,

MWIFIEX_BSS_MODE_IBSS (2) --> NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC (1)

The issue is fixed by swapping static character array used to
display interface type information.
