iio: light sensor: Fix a panic in the tsl2563 driver.

Add a wrapper for this driver around the IIO_CHAN() wrapper to make channel
parameters more readable.  This fixes a panic caused by the info_masks being
accidentally passed in as channel2 parameters which easily surpass the size
of the iio_modifier_names_light array.
