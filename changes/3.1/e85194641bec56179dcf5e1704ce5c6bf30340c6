drm/i915/dp: Don't turn CPT DP ports on too early

The docs say the port has to come on in training pattern 1; at this
point, though, ->DP is in normal mode.  The intent here is to wait
until the port is in fact sending data, but that doesn't happen since
we've broken the sequence the hardware expects, and the vblank wait will
time out and kvetch in the log.
