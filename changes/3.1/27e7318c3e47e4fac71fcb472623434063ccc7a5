[S390] nss,initrd: kernel image and initrd must be in different segments

When IPL'ing from a block device and an NSS should be created we must
make sure that the kernel image and the initrd are in different 1MB
segments. Otherwise creating the NSS will fail.
So we make sure the initrd is 4MB behind the end of the kernel image
like we do already when IPL via the VM reader is performed.
