bnx2x: count statistic ramrods on EQ to prevent MC assert

This patch includes:
 - Counting statistics ramrods as EQ ramrods the way they should be. This
   accounting is meant to prevent MC asserts in case of software bugs.
 - Fixes in debug facilities which were added while working on one of such
   bugs.
