PM / Domains: Set device state to "active" during system resume

The runtime PM status of devices in a power domain that is not
powered off in pm_genpd_complete() should be set to "active", because
those devices are operational at this point.  Some of them may not be
in use, though, so make pm_genpd_complete() call pm_runtime_idle()
in addition to pm_runtime_set_active() for each of them.
