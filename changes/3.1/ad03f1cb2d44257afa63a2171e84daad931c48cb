OMAP4: clock data: Add missing divider selection for auxclks

On OMAP4 the auxclk nodes (part of SCRM) support both
divider as well as parent selection.
Supporting this requires splitting the existing nodes
(which support only parent selection) into two nodes,
one for parent and another for divider selection.
The nodes for parent selection are named auxclk*_src_ck
and the ones for divider selection as auxclk*_ck.
