mmc: core: use non-reentrant workqueue for clock gating

The default multithread workqueue can cause the same work to be executed
concurrently on a different CPUs. This isn't really suitable for clock
gating as it might already gated the clock and gating it twice results both
host->clk_old and host->ios.clock to be set to 0.

To prevent this from happening we use system_nrt_wq instead.
