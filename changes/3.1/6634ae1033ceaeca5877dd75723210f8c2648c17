ptrace_init_task: initialize child->jobctl explicitly

new_child->jobctl is not initialized during the fork, it is copied
from parent->jobctl. Currently this is harmless, the forking task
is running and copy_process() can't succeed if signal_pending() is
true, so only JOBCTL_STOP_DEQUEUED can be copied. Still this is a
bit fragile, it would be more clean to set ->jobctl = 0 explicitly.

Also, check ->ptrace != 0 instead of PT_PTRACED, move the
CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT code up.
