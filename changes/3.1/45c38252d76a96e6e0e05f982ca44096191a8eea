OMAP4: hwmod: Introduce the module control in hwmod control

Take advantage of the explicit modulemode control to fix
the way parents clocks are managed.
A module must be disabled before any parents are disabled.
That programming model was not possible with the previous
implementation that was considering a modulemode as a leaf
clock node managed by the clock fmwk.
This was leading to bad crash upon disable when the parent
clock was gated before the module completed its transition
to idle.
