MIPS: Enable cpu_has_clo_clz for MIPS Technologies' platforms

Enable cpu_has_clo_clz only when CONFIG_CPU_MIPS32 or CONFIG_CPU_MIPS64
is selected.  This will optimize fls() and __fls() to use CLZ insn, and
eventually ffs() and __ffs() as well.

Malta and MIPSSim are development platforms, and need to take care of
various processor configurations, release rivisions and so on, even
across different MIPS ISAs.  For such platforms we have to be careful,
for instance, with turning on cpu_has_mips{32,64}r[12] features.

As for CLZ, all MIPS32/64 processors support it, regardless of release
revisions.
