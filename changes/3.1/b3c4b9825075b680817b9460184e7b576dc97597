xen/tracing: fix compile errors when tracing is disabled.

When CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER is disabled, compilation fails as follows:
  CC      arch/x86/xen/setup.o
In file included from arch/x86/include/asm/xen/hypercall.h:42,
                 from arch/x86/xen/setup.c:19:

Fix this by making sure struct multicall_entry has a declaration in
scope at all times, and don't bother compiling xen/trace.c when tracing
is disabled.
