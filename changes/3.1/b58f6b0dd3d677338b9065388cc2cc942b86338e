perf, core: Fix initial task_ctx/event installation

A lost Quilt refresh of 2c29ef0fef8 (perf: Simplify and fix
__perf_install_in_context()) is causing grief and lockups,
reported by Jiri Olsa.

When installing an event in a task context, there's a number of
issues:

 - there might not be an existing task context, in which case
   we should install the now current context;

 - there might already be a context, not the current one, in
   which case we should de-schedule the old and install the new;

these cases were dealt with in the lost refresh, however there is one
further case that was found in testing:

 - there might already be a context, the current one, in which
   case we should still de-schedule, and should take care
   to re-install it (note that task_ctx_sched_out() clears
   cpuctx->task_ctx).
