UBIFS: remove unused and unneeded debugging function

This patch contains several minor clean-up and preparational cahnges.

1. Remove 'dbg_read()', 'dbg_write()', 'dbg_change()', and 'dbg_leb_erase()'
   functions as they are not used.
2. Remove 'dbg_leb_read()' and 'dbg_is_mapped()' as they are not really needed,
   it is fine to let reads go through in failure mode.
3. Rename 'offset' argument to 'offs' to be consistent with the rest of UBIFS
   code.
