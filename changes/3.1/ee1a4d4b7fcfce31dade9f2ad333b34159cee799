ASoC: Tegra: wm8903 machine driver: Drop Ventana support

Board file support for Ventana is not yet mainlined, and probably won't
ever be given the move to Device-Tree. Consequently, the Ventana entry
is being removed from arch/arm/tools/mach-types in the next merge window,
since it was registered over a year ago.

This will also remove function machine_is_ventana(), which is used by
the ASoC Tegra WM8903 machine driver. This will cause compilation
failures. Drop Ventana support to resolve this.

Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, tegra_wm8903.c will be able to
configure itself from Device-Tree, and hence we'll be able to re-instate
Ventana support just by creating a .dts file for the board.

Also note that Aebl support is in a similar boat. However, that board
isn't scheduled for deprecation for at least another 5 months, and
perhaps we will have completely removed non-Device-Tree support from
tegra_wm8903.c by then and/or adjusted mach-types policy.
