block: add bsg helper library

This moves the FC classes bsg code to the block layer and
makes it a lib so that other classes like iscsi and SAS can use it.

It is helpful because working with the request queue, bios,
creating scatterlists, etc are a pain that the LLD does not
have to worry about with normal IOs and should not have to
worry about for bsg requests.
