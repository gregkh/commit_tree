slub: reduce overhead of slub_debug

slub checks for poison one byte by one, which is highly inefficient
and shows up frequently as a highest cpu-eater in perf top.

Joining reads gives nice speedup:

(Compiling some project with different options)
                                 make -j12    make clean
slub_debug disabled:             1m 27s       1.2 s
slub_debug enabled:              1m 46s       7.6 s
slub_debug enabled + this patch: 1m 33s       3.2 s

check_bytes still shows up high, but not always at the top.
