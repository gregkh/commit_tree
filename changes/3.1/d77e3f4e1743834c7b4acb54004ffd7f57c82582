usb: renesas_usbhs: add pipe/fifo link

renesas_usbhs has CFIFO which is for PIO transfer,
and D0FIFO/D1FIFO which are for DMA transfer.
The pipe selects one of these fifo when it send/recv data.
But fifo must not be selected to different pipe in same time.
This patch add pipe/fifo link for each other,
and fifo is not selected by another pipe until it is unselected.
