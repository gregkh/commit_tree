[media] xc4000: continued cleanup of the firmware loading routine

Properly setup the standard firmware loading and scode loading, as well as
getting rid of a ton of dead code.  Note that I am getting a single i2c
error when the standard firmware sets the video standard, but everything else
seems to be loading properly now.
