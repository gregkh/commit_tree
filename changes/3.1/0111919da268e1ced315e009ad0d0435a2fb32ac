perf tools: Add missing 'node' alias to the hw_cache[] array

Add "node" as a simple alias for NODE cache events.

The addition of NODE cache events broke the parse_alias
function, so any mismatched event caused the segfault, like:

  # ./perf stat -e krava ls

The hw_cache/hw_cache_op/hw_cache_result arrays needs to follow
PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_*MAX enums. Adding those MAXs to be size
of those arrays, so possible ommision in future wil not lead to
segfault.

Adding read/write/prefetch as allowed operations for node cache
event.
