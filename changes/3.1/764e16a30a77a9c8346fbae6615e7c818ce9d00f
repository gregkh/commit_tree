perf record: Create events initially disabled and enable after init

perf-record currently creates events enabled. When doing a system wide
collection (-a arg) this causes data collection for perf's
initialization activities -- eg., perf_event__synthesize_threads().

For some events (e.g., context switch S/W event or tracepoints like
syscalls) perf's initialization causes a lot of events to be captured
frequently generating "Check IO/CPU overload!" warnings on larger
systems (e.g., 2 socket, quad core, hyperthreading).

perf's initialization phase can be skipped by creating events
disabled and then enabling them once the initialization is done.
