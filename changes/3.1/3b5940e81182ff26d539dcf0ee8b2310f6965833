ARM: kprobes: Decode 16-bit Thumb special data instructions

These data-processing instructions operate on the full range of CPU
registers, so to simulate them we have to modify the registers used
by the instruction. We can't make use of the decoding table framework to
do this because the registers aren't encoded cleanly in separate
nibbles, therefore we need a custom decode function.
