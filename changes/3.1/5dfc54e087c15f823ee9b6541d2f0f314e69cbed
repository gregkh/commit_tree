ARM: GIC: avoid routing interrupts to offline CPUs

The irq_set_affinity() method can be called with masks which include
offline CPUs.  This allows offline CPUs to have interrupts routed to
them by writing to /proc/irq/*/smp_affinity after hotplug has taken
a CPU offline.  Fix this by ensuring that we select a target CPU
present in both the required affinity and the online CPU mask.

Ensure that we return IRQ_SET_MASK_OK (which happens to be 0) on
success to ensure generic code copies the new mask into the irq_data
structure.
