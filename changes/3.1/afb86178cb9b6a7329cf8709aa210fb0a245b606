ext4: remove unnecessary comments in ext4_orphan_add()

The comment from Al Viro about possible race in the ext4_orphan_add() is
not justified. There is no race possible as we always have either i_mutex
locked, or the inode can not be referenced from outside hence the
J_ASSERS should not be hit from the reason described in comment.

This commit replaces it with notion that we are holding i_mutex so it
should not be possible for i_nlink to be changed while waiting for
s_orphan_lock.
