ceph: avoid d_parent in ceph_dentry_hash; fix ceph_encode_fh() hashing bug

Have caller pass in a safely-obtained reference to the parent directory
for calculating a dentry's hash valud.

While we're here, simpify the flow through ceph_encode_fh() so that there
is a single exit point and cleanup.

Also fix a bug with the dentry hash calculation: calculate the hash for the
dentry we were given, not its parent.
