oom: task->mm == NULL doesn't mean the memory was freed

exit_mm() sets ->mm == NULL then it does mmput()->exit_mmap() which
frees the memory.

However select_bad_process() checks ->mm != NULL before TIF_MEMDIE,
so it continues to kill other tasks even if we have the oom-killed
task freeing its memory.

Change select_bad_process() to check ->mm after TIF_MEMDIE, but skip
the tasks which have already passed exit_notify() to ensure a zombie
with TIF_MEMDIE set can't block oom-killer. Alternatively we could
probably clear TIF_MEMDIE after exit_mmap().
