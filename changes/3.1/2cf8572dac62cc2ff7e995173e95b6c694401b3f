Btrfs: use the commit_root for reading free_space_inode crcs

Now that we are using regular file crcs for the free space cache,
we can deadlock if we try to read the free_space_inode while we are
updating the crc tree.

This commit fixes things by using the commit_root to read the crcs.  This is
safe because we the free space cache file would already be loaded if
that block group had been changed in the current transaction.
