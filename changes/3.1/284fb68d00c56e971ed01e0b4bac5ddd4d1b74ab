rapidio: fix use of non-compatible registers

Replace/remove use of RIO v.1.2 registers/bits that are not
forward-compatible with newer versions of RapidIO specification.

RapidIO specification v.1.3 removed Write Port CSR, Doorbell CSR,
Mailbox CSR and Mailbox and Doorbell bits of the PEF CAR.

Use of removed (since RIO v.1.3) register bits affects users of
currently available 1.3 and 2.x compliant devices who may use not so
recent kernel versions.

Removing checks for unsupported bits makes corresponding routines
compatible with all versions of RapidIO specification.  Therefore,
backporting makes stable kernel versions compliant with RIO v.1.3 and
later as well.
