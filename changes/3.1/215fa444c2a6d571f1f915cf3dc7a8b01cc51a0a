firewire: ohci: fix PHY reg access after card ejection

Detect and handle ejection of FireWire CardBus cards in PHY register
accesses:

  - The last attempt of firewire-core to reset the bus during shutdown
    caused a spurious "firewire_ohci: failed to write phy reg" error
    message in the log.  Skip this message as well as the prior retry
    loop that needlessly took 100 milliseconds.

  - In the unlikely case that a PHY register was read right after card
    ejection, a bogus value was obtained and possibly acted upon.
    Instead, fail the read attempt.
