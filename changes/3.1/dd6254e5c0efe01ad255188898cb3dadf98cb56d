firewire: ohci: remove superfluous posted write flushes

The call to flush_writes() in context_stop() is superfluous because
another register read is done immediately afterwards.

The call to flush_writes() in ar_context_run() does not need to be done
individually for each AR context, so move it to ohci_enable().  This
also makes ohci_enable() clearer because it no longer depends on a side
effect of ar_context_run() to flush its own register writes.

Finally, the setting of a context's wake bit does not need to be flushed
because neither the driver logic nor the API require the CPU to wait for
this action.  This removes the last MMIO reads from the packet queueing
code paths.
