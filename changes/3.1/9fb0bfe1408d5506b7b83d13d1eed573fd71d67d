ACPI, APEI, Add WHEA _OSC support

APEI firmware first mode must be turned on explicitly on some
machines, otherwise there may be no GHES hardware error record for
hardware error notification.  APEI bit in generic _OSC call can be
used to do that, but on some machine, a special WHEA _OSC call must be
used.  This patch adds the support to that WHEA _OSC call.
