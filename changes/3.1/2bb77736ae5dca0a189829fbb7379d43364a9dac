md/raid10: Make use of new recovery_disabled handling

When we get a read error during recovery, RAID10 previously
arranged for the recovering device to appear to fail so that
the recovery stops and doesn't restart.  This is misleading and wrong.

Instead, make use of the new recovery_disabled handling and mark
the target device and having recovery disabled.

Add appropriate checks in add_disk and remove_disk so that devices
are removed and not re-added when recovery is disabled.
