[S390] reference bit testing for unmapped pages

On x86 a page without a mapper is by definition not referenced / old.
The s390 architecture keeps the reference bit in the storage key and
the current code will check the storage key for page without a mapper.
This leads to an interesting effect: the first time an s390 system
needs to write pages to swap it only finds referenced pages. This
causes a lot of pages to get added and written to the swap device.
To avoid this behaviour change page_referenced to query the storage
key only if there is a mapper of the page.
