ARM: Thumb-2: Fix exception return sequence to restore stack correctly

The implementation of svc_exit didn't take into account any stack hole
created by svc_entry; as happens with the undef handler when kprobes are
configured. The fix is to read the saved value of SP rather than trying
to calculate it.
