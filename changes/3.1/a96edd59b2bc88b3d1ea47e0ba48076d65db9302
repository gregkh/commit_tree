ASoC: Tegra: tegra_pcm_deallocate_dma_buffer: Don't OOPS

Not all PCM devices have all sub-streams. Specifically, the SPDIF driver
only supports playback and hence has no capture substream. Check whether
a substream exists before dereferencing it, when de-allocating DMA
buffers in tegra_pcm_deallocate_dma_buffer.
