KVM: Fix instruction size issue in pvclock scaling

Commit de2d1a524e94 ("KVM: Fix register corruption in pvclock_scale_delta")
introduced a mul instruction that may have only a memory operand; the
assembler therefore cannot select the correct size:

   pvclock.s:229: Error: no instruction mnemonic suffix given and no register
operands; can't size instruction

In this example the assembler is:

         #APP
         mul -48(%rbp) ; shrd $32, %rdx, %rax
         #NO_APP

A simple solution is to use mulq.
