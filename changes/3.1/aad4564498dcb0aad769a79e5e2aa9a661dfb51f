sparc: Add alignment flag to PCI expansion resources

Currently no type of alignment is specified for PCI expansion roms while 
parsing the openfirmware tree. This causes calls to pci_map_rom() to fail.
IORESOURCE_SIZEALIGN is the default alignment used for rom resouces in 
pci/probe.c, and has been verified to work with various cards on a ultra 10.
