xfs: fix ->write_inode return values

Currently we always redirty an inode that was attempted to be written out
synchronously but has been cleaned by an AIL pushed internall, which is
rather bogus.  Fix that by doing the i_update_core check early on and
return 0 for it.  Also include async calls for it, as doing any work for
those is just as pointless.  While we're at it also fix the sign for the
EIO return in case of a filesystem shutdown, and fix the completely
non-sensical locking around xfs_log_inode.
