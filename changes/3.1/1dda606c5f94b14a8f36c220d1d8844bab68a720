KVM: Add compat ioctl for KVM_SET_SIGNAL_MASK

KVM has an ioctl to define which signal mask should be used while running
inside VCPU_RUN. At least for big endian systems, this mask is different
on 32-bit and 64-bit systems (though the size is identical).

Add a compat wrapper that converts the mask to whatever the kernel accepts,
allowing 32-bit kvm user space to set signal masks.

This patch fixes qemu with --enable-io-thread on ppc64 hosts when running
32-bit user land.
