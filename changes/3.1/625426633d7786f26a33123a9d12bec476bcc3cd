crypto: gf128mul - fix call to memset()

In gf128mul_lle() and gf128mul_bbe() r isn't completely initialized with
zero because the size argument passed to memset() is the size of the
pointer, not the structure it points to.

Luckily there are no in-kernel users of those functions so the ABI
change implied by this fix should break no existing code.

Based on a patch by the PaX Team.
