sparc: _sparc_find_resource() should check for exact matches

The address that's passed to _sparc_find_resource() should always be the
start address of a resource:
  - iounmap() passes a page-aligned virtual address, while the original
    address was created by adding the in-page offset to the resource's
    start address,
  - sbus_free_coherent() and pci32_free_coherent() should be passed an
    address obtained from sbus_alloc_coherent() resp. pci32_alloc_coherent(),
    which is always a resource's start address.

Hence replace the range check by a check for an exact match.
