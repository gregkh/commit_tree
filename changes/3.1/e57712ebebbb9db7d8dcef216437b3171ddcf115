merge fchmod() and fchmodat() guts, kill ancient broken kludge

The kludge in question is undocumented and doesn't work for 32bit
binaries on amd64, sparc64 and s390.  Passing (mode_t)-1 as
mode had (since 0.99.14v and contrary to behaviour of any
other Unix, prescriptions of POSIX, SuS and our own manpages)
was kinda-sorta no-op.  Note that any software relying on
that (and looking for examples shows none) would be visibly
broken on sparc64, where practically all userland is built
32bit.  No such complaints noticed...
