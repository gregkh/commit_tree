PM: Allow the clocks management code to be used during system suspend

The common clocks management code in drivers/base/power/clock_ops.c
is going to be used during system-wide power transitions as well as
for runtime PM, so it shouldn't depend on CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME.
However, the suspend/resume functions provided by it for
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME unset, to be used during system-wide power
transitions, should not behave in the same way as their counterparts
defined for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME set, because in that case the clocks
are managed differently at run time.

The names of the functions still contain the word "runtime" after
this change, but that is going to be modified by a separate patch
later.
