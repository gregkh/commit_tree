printk: Release console_sem after logbuf_lock

Release console_sem after unlocking the logbuf_lock so that we don't
generate wakeups while holding logbuf_lock. This avoids some lock
inversion troubles once we remove the lockdep_off bits between
logbuf_lock and rq->lock (prints while holding rq->lock vs doing
wakeups while holding logbuf_lock).

There's of course still an actual deadlock where the printk()s under
rq->lock will issue a wakeup from the up() call, but lockdep won't
warn about that since semaphores are not tracked.
