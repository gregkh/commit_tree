Btrfs: force unplugs when switching from high to regular priority bios

Btrfs does bio submissions from a worker thread, and each device
has a list of high priority bios and regular priority bios.

Synchronous writes go to the high priority thread while async writes
go to regular list.  This commit brings back an explicit unplug
any time we switch from high to regular priority, which makes it
easier for the block layer to give us low latencies.
