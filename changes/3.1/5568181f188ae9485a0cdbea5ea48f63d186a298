tty/serial: Fix XSCALE serial ports, e.g. ce4100

Commit 4539c24fe4f92c09ee668ef959d3e8180df619b9 "tty/serial: Add
explicit PORT_TEGRA type" introduced separate flags describing the need
for IER bits UUE and RTOIE. Both bits are required for the XSCALE port
type. While that patch updated uart_config[] as required, the auto-probing
code wasn't updated to set the RTOIE flag when an XSCALE port type was
detected. This caused such ports to stop working. This patch rectifies
that.
