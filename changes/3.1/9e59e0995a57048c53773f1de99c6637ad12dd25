perf tools: Add support for disabling -Werror via WERROR=0

GCC often introduces new warnings with lots of false positives -
breaking -Werror builds. WERROR=0 allows one to build perf without much
fuss - while still encouraging people to send patches to avoid the fuss
of having to type WERROR=0.

Bisecting back to commits that produce a (mostly harmless) warning on
some compilers is more difficult. With WERROR=0 one could bisect without
worrying about harmless warnings.
