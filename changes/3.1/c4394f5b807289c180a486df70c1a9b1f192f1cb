ALSA: hda - Fix issue that front can't output sound for VT1718S

For VT1718S, Mixer 9 doesn't expose the connection to DAC 0. So when
building up a 'PCM Playback' amplifier control, it will fail since
getting DAC 0 index of Mixer 9 returned -1. So I added a dac_mixer_idx
to indicated the actual index of DAC 0 to Mixer 9. Following is the
patch and next mail is another.
