mtrr: fix UP breakage caused during switch to stop_machine

While removing custom rendezvous code and switching to stop_machine,
commit 192d8857427d ("x86, mtrr: use stop_machine APIs for doing MTRR
rendezvous") completely dropped mtrr setting code on !CONFIG_SMP
breaking MTRR settting on UP.

Fix it by removing the incorrect CONFIG_SMP.
