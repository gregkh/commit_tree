staging: brcm80211: fullmac register access macro's take u32 instead of pointers

Code cleanup. Fullmac contains macro's that access registers on the 32 bits
backplane bus. These registers should not be declared as pointers since
pointers can be 64 bits. The following patch series gets rid of these pointers
and ultimately of all compiler warning when compiling for amd64.
