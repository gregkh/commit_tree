xen: Fix misleading WARN message at xen_release_chunk

WARN message should not complain
 "Failed to release memory %lx-%lx err=%d\n"
                           ^^^^^^^
about range when it fails to release just one page,
instead it should say what pfn is not freed.

In addition line:
 printk(KERN_INFO "xen_release_chunk: looking at area pfn %lx-%lx: "
 ...
 printk(KERN_CONT "%lu pages freed\n", len);
will be broken if WARN in between this line is fired. So fix it
by using a single printk for this.
