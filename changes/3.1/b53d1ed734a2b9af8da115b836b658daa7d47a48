Revert "cfq: Remove special treatment for metadata rqs."

We have a kernel build regression since 3.1-rc1, which is about 10%
regression. The kernel source is in an ext3 filesystem.
Alex Shi bisect it to commit:

    cfq: Remove special treatment for metadata rqs.

Apparently this is caused by lack metadata preemption, where ext3/ext4
do use READ_META. I didn't see a way to fix the issue, so suggest
reverting the patch.

This reverts commit a07405b7802691d29ab3b23bdc76ee6d006aad0b.
