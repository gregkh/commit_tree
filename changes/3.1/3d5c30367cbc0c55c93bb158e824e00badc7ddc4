PM: Rename clock management functions

The common PM clock management functions may be used for system
suspend/resume as well as for runtime PM, so rename them
accordingly.  Modify kerneldoc comments describing these functions
and kernel messages printed by them, so that they refer to power
management in general rather that to runtime PM.
