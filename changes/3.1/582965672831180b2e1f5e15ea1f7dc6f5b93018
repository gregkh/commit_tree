carl9170: set beacon xmit power to the max

Harshal Chhaya discovered during network tests, that
several of his clients dropped-off the network. The
captured packets shows that the beacons sent by the
AP are at a much lower power than the other data
packets.

The reason for this mishap: The driver never updated
the beacon phy register, so all beacons were always
sent at the lowest power.
