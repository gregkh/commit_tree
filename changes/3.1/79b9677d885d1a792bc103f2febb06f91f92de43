[SCSI] sr: check_events() ignore GET_EVENT when TUR says otherwise

Some broken devices indicates that media has changed on every
GET_EVENT_STATUS_NOTIFICATION.  This translates into MEDIA_CHANGE
uevent on every open() which lets udev run into a loop.

Verify GET_EVENT result against TUR and if it generates spurious
events for several times in a row, ignore the GET_EVENT events, and
trust only the TUR status.

This is the log of a USB stick with a (broken) fake CDROM drive:

-tj: Updated to consider only spurious GET_EVENT events among
     different types of disagreement and allow using TUR for kernel
     event polling after GET_EVENT is ignored.
