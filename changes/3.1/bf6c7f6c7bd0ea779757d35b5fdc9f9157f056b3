don't pass nameidata to vfs_create() from ecryptfs_create()

Instead of playing with removal of LOOKUP_OPEN, mangling (and
restoring) nd->path, just pass NULL to vfs_create().  The whole
point of what's being done there is to suppress any attempts
to open file by underlying fs, which is what nd == NULL indicates.
