UBIFS: add global debugfs knobs

Now we have per-FS (superblock) debugfs knobs, but they have one drawback - you
have to first mount the FS and only after this you can switch self-checks
on/off. But often we want to have the checks enabled during the mount.
Introduce global debugging knobs for this purpose.
