[S390] race safe external interrupt registration

The (un-)register_external_interrupt functions are not race safe if
more than one interrupt handler is added or deleted for an external
interrupt concurrently.

Make the registration / unregistration of external interrupts race safe
by using RCU and a spinlock. RCU is used to avoid a performance penalty
in the external interrupt handler, the register and unregister functions
are protected by the spinlock and are not performance critical.
call_rcu must be used since the SCLP driver uses the interface with
IRQs disabled. Also use the generic list implementation rather than
homebrewn list code.
