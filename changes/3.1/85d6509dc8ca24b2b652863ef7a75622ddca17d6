mmc: sdhci: make sdhci-pltfm device drivers self registered

The patch turns the common stuff in sdhci-pltfm.c into functions, and
add device drivers their own .probe and .remove which in turn call
into the common functions, so that those sdhci-pltfm device drivers
register itself and keep all device specific things away from common
sdhci-pltfm file.
