[SCSI] libfc: fix referencing to fc_fcp_pkt from the frame pointer via fr_fsp()

In commit 6a716a8, while releasing the DDP context in case frame_send() failed,
the frame may already be freed, so we should store the pointer to fc_fcp_pkt and
release the DDP context using the locally stored fsp instead of getting fsp from
the fr_fsp(fp) on a frame.
