hwmon: (coretemp) Add core/pkg threshold support to Coretemp

This patch adds the core and pkg support to coretemp.
These thresholds can be configured via the sysfs interfaces tempX_max
and tempX_max_hyst. An interrupt is generated when CPU temperature reaches
or crosses above tempX_max OR drops below tempX_max_hyst.

This patch is based on the documentation in IA Manual vol 3A, that can be
downloaded from here:
