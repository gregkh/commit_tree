ALSA: fm801: Gracefully handle failure of tuner auto-detect

Commit 9676001559fce06e37c7dc230ab275f605556176
("ALSA: fm801: add error handling if auto-detect fails") seems to
break systems that were previously working without a tuner.

As a bonus, this should fix init and cleanup for the case where the
tuner is explicitly disabled.
