ALSA: hda - Fix a regression of the position-buffer check

The commit a810364a0424c297242c6c66071a42f7675a5568
    ALSA: hda - Handle -1 as invalid position, too
caused a regression on some machines that require the position-buffer
instead of LPIB, e.g. resulting in noises with mic recording with
PulseAudio.

This patch fixes the detection by delaying the test at the timing as
same as 3.0, i.e. doing the position check only when requested in
azx_position_ok().
