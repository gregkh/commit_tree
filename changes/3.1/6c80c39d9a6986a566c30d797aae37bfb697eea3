iwlagn: fix dangling scan request

If iwl_scan_initiate() fails for any reason,
priv->scan_request and priv->scan_vif are left
dangling. This can lead to a crash later when
iwl_bg_scan_completed() tries to run a pending
scan request.

In practice, this seems to be very rare due to
the STATUS_SCANNING check earlier. That check,
however, is wrong -- it should allow a scan to
be queued when a reset/roc scan is going on.
When a normal scan is already going on, a new
one can't be issued by mac80211, so that code
can be removed completely. I introduced this
bug when adding off-channel support in commit
266af4c745952e9bebf687dd68af58df553cb59d.
