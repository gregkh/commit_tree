virtio_net: introduce VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_DATA_VALID

There's no need for the guest to validate the checksum if it have been
validated by host nics. So this patch introduces a new flag -
VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_DATA_VALID which is used to bypass the checksum
examing in guest. The backend (tap/macvtap) may set this flag when
met skbs with CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY to save cpu utilization.

No feature negotiation is needed as old driver just ignore this flag.

Iperf shows 12%-30% performance improvement for UDP traffic. For TCP,
when gro is on no difference as it produces skb with partial
checksum. But when gro is disabled, 20% or even higher improvement
could be measured by netperf.
