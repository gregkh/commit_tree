drivers/rtc/rtc-twl.c: check return value of twl_rtc_write_u8() in twl_rtc_set_time()

We forget to save the return value of the call to
twl_rtc_write_u8(save_control, REG_RTC_CTRL_REG); in 'ret', making the
test of 'ret < 0' dead code since 'ret' then couldn't possibly have
changed since the last test just a few lines above.  It also makes us not
detect failures from that specific twl_rtc_write_u8() call.
