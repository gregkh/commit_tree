[media] Fix regression introduced which broke the Hauppauge USBLive 2

The following patch addresses the regression introduced in the cx231xx
driver which stopped the Hauppauge USBLive2 from working.

Confirmed working by both myself and the user who reported the issue
on the KernelLabs blog (Robert DeLuca).

At some point during refactoring of the cx231xx driver, the USBLive 2 device
became broken.  This patch results in the device working again.

Thanks to Robert DeLuca for sponsoring this work.
