[SCSI] bnx2i: Fixed the endian on TTT for NOP out transmission

The iscsi_nopout task's TTT is defined as __be32 while the DMA
memory to the chip is CPU specific.  This creates a problem for
unsolicited NOP-In responses where the TTT is not the RESERVED
tag of 0xFFs.  This patch adds a call to be32_to_cpu for the TTT
specified.
