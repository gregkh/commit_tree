carl9170: Fix mismatch in carl9170_op_set_key mutex lock-unlock

If is_main_vif(ar, vif) reports that we have to fall back
to software encryption, we goto err_softw; before locking ar->mutex.
As a result, we have unprotected call to carl9170_set_operating_mode
and unmatched mutex_unlock.

The patch fix the issue by adding mutex_lock before goto.
