netlink: advertise incomplete dumps

Consider the following situation:
 * a dump that would show 8 entries, four in the first
   round, and four in the second
 * between the first and second rounds, 6 entries are
   removed
 * now the second round will not show any entry, and
   even if there is a sequence/generation counter the
   application will not know

To solve this problem, add a new flag NLM_F_DUMP_INTR
to the netlink header that indicates the dump wasn't
consistent, this flag can also be set on the MSG_DONE
message that terminates the dump, and as such above
situation can be detected.

To achieve this, add a sequence counter to the netlink
callback struct. Of course, netlink code still needs
to use this new functionality. The correct way to do
that is to always set cb->seq when a dumpit callback
is invoked and call nl_dump_check_consistent() for
each new message. The core code will also call this
function for the final MSG_DONE message.

To make it usable with generic netlink, a new function
genlmsg_nlhdr() is needed to obtain the netlink header
from the genetlink user header.
