md/raid10: unify handling of write completion.

A write can complete at two different places:
1/ when the last member-device write completes, through
   raid10_end_write_request
2/ in make_request() when we remove the initial bias from ->remaining.

These two should do exactly the same thing and the comment says they
do, but they don't.

So factor the correct code out into a function and call it in both
places.  This makes the code much more similar to RAID1.

The difference is only significant if there is an error, and they
usually take a while, so it is unlikely that there will be an error
already when make_request is completing, so this is unlikely to cause
real problems.
