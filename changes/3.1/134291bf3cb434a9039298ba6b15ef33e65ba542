KVM: MMU: Clean up the error handling of walk_addr_generic()

Avoid two step jump to the error handling part.  This eliminates the use
of the variables present and rsvd_fault.

We also use the const type qualifier to show that write/user/fetch_fault
do not change in the function.

Both of these were suggested by Ingo Molnar.
