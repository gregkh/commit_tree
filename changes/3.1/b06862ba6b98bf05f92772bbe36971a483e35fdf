acerhdf: add support for Aspire 1810TZ BIOS v1.3314

Would you please consider applying the following patch adding support for
the Aspire 1810TZ BIOS v.1.3314 version to the acerhdf module and avoids the
following error:

acerhdf: unknown (unsupported) BIOS version Acer/Aspire 1810TZ/v1.3314, ple=
ase report, aborting!

Not sure about the other Aspire models, but it seems at least 1810T should
also be updated.
