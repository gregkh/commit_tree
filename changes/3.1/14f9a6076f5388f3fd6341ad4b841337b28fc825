NFS: Parse and store all multipath DS addresses

This parses and stores all addresses associated with each data server,
laying the groundwork for supporting multipath to data servers.

 - Skips over addresses that cannot be parsed (ie IPv6 addrs if v6 is not
   enabled).  Only fails if none of the addresses are recognizable
 - Currently only uses the first address that parsed cleanly
 - Tested against pynfs server (modified to support multipath)
