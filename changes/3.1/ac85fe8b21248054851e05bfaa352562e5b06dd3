sparc: Sanitize cpu feature detection and reporting.

Instead of evaluating the cpu features for ELF_HWCAP every exec,
calculate it once at boot time.

Add AV_SPARC_* capability flag bits, compatible with what Solaris
reports to applications.

Report these capabilities once in the kernel log, and also via
/proc/cpuinfo in a new "cpucaps" entry.

If available, fetch the cpu features from the machine description
'hwcap-list' property of the 'cpu' node.
