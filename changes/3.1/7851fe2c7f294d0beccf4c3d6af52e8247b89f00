[SCSI] lpfc 8.3.25: Adapter Interface fixes and changes

Adapter Interface fixes and changes

- Modify the macro field from lpfc_init_vpi_vpi to lpfc_init_vfi_vpi
- Add the new CQE_CODE_RECEIVE_V1 CQE Code, add code in the driver to handle
  the new Code the same as the CQE_CODE_RECEIVE code except that there are
  two new checks for this code that will cause the driver to use the new V1
  macros for rq_id and fcf_id.
- Fix a bug in lpfc_prep_seq() where the size out of the first CQE was
  ONLY being used, even though multiple dmabufs make up the sequence,
  each have their own CQE with potentially different sizes.
- Fix bug in lpfc_bsg_ct_unsol_event() where the ulpContext and ulpWord[3]
  fields of the XMIT_SEQUENCE64_CX IOCB were being calculated incorrectly.
- Do physical to logical translation before indexing into the active
  XRI array.
- Populate physical vpi in the iocb data structure.
- Put the current accumulated total in each IOCB in the chain as we are
  walking thru then. The last IOCB in the chain should have the total
  length of the sequence.
