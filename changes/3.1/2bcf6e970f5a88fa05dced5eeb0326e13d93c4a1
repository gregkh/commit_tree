xfs: start periodic workers later

Start the periodic sync workers only after we have finished xfs_mountfs
and thus fully set up the filesystem structures.  Without this we can
call into xfs_qm_sync before the quotainfo strucute is set up if the
mount takes unusually long, and probably hit other incomplete states
as well.

Also clean up the xfs_fs_fill_super error path by using consistent
label names, and removing an impossible to reach case.
