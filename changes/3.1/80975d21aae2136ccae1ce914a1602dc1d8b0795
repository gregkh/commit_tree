cifs: cope with negative dentries in cifs_get_root

The loop around lookup_one_len doesn't handle the case where it might
return a negative dentry, which can cause an oops on the next pass
through the loop. Check for that and break out of the loop with an
error of -ENOENT if there is one.

Fixes the panic reported here:
