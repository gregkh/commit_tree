sched: Remove unlikely() from rt_policy() in sched.c

The rt_policy() has an unlikely() that the policy it is checking is
of RT priority (SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR).

According to the annotate branch profiler it is incorrect most of the time:

 correct incorrect  %        Function                  File              Line
 ------- ---------  -        --------                  ----              ----
   36667   654674  94 rt_policy                      sched.c              126

This makes sense because the rt_policy() is used by the sched_set_scheduler()
and nice(). Although users may use sys_nice a bit, all RT users use
the sched_set_scheduler() to set their RT priority, including kernel
threads.

The above numbers were from a normal desktop computer running
firefox, evolution, xchat and was part of a distcc compile farm.
