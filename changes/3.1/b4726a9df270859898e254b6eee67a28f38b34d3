xen/blkback: Don't let in-flight requests defer pending ones.

Running RING_FINAL_CHECK_FOR_REQUESTS from make_response is a bad
idea. It means that in-flight I/O is essentially blocking continued
batches. This essentially kills throughput on frontends which unplug
(or even just notify) early and rightfully assume addtional requests
will be picked up on time, not synchronously.
