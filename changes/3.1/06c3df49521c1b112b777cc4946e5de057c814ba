clocksource: apb: Share APB timer code with other platforms

The APB timers are an IP block from Synopsys (DesignWare APB timers)
and are also found in other systems including ARM SoC's.  This patch
adds functions for creating clock_event_devices and clocksources from
APB timers but does not do the resource allocation.  This is handled
in a higher layer to allow the timers to be created from multiple
methods such as platform_devices.
