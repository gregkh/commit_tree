mac80211: be more careful in suspend/resume

When suspending with all netdevs down, the device
is stopped but we still call a number of driver
callbacks that the driver might not expect. The
same happens during resume, we might call a few
callbacks without starting the driver. Fix this
by checking open_count around more things and
exiting quickly if it is 0.

Also, while at this I noticed that the coverage
class isn't reprogrammed after resume, so add
that.
