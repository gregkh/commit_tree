mm: account skipped entries to avoid looping in find_get_pages

The found entries by find_get_pages() could be all swap entries.  In
this case we skip the entries, but make sure the skipped entries are
accounted, so we don't keep looping.

Using nr_found > nr_skip to simplify code as suggested by Eric.
