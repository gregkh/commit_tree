fs: simplify the blockdev_direct_IO prototype

Simple filesystems always pass inode->i_sb_bdev as the block device
argument, and never need a end_io handler.  Let's simply things for
them and for my grepping activity by dropping these arguments.  The
only thing not falling into that scheme is ext4, which passes and
end_io handler without needing special flags (yet), but given how
messy the direct I/O code there is use of __blockdev_direct_IO
in one instead of two out of three cases isn't going to make a large
difference anyway.
