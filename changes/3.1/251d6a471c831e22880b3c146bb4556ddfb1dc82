writeback: trace event writeback_single_inode

It is valuable to know how the dirty inodes are iterated and their IO size.

"writeback_single_inode: bdi 8:0: ino=134246746 state=I_DIRTY_SYNC|I_SYNC age=414 index=0 to_write=1024 wrote=0"

- "state" reflects inode->i_state at the end of writeback_single_inode()
- "index" reflects mapping->writeback_index after the ->writepages() call
- "to_write" is the wbc->nr_to_write at entrance of writeback_single_inode()
- "wrote" is the number of pages actually written

v2: add trace event writeback_single_inode_requeue as proposed by Dave.
