Bluetooth: Add support for SMP timeout

This patch adds support for disconnecting the link when SMP procedure
takes more than 30 seconds.

SMP begins when either the Pairing Request command is sent or the
Pairing Response is received, and it ends when the link is encrypted
(or terminated). Vol 3, Part H Section 3.4.
