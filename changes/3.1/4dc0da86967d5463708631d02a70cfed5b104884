perf: Add context field to perf_event

The perf_event overflow handler does not receive any caller-derived
argument, so many callers need to resort to looking up the perf_event
in their local data structure.  This is ugly and doesn't scale if a
single callback services many perf_events.

Fix by adding a context parameter to perf_event_create_kernel_counter()
(and derived hardware breakpoints APIs) and storing it in the perf_event.
The field can be accessed from the callback as event->overflow_handler_context.
All callers are updated.
