x86, UV: Clean up uv_mmrs.h

No code changes. Reformat definitions to make it more readable.

I fixed alignment of comments in the structure definitions.

Also aligned comments and most field definitions & values. Also
sorted the defines for the SHIFT & MASK values for each MMR.
This make the file visually much more acceptable.

Some of the symbol names are still quite long. The file is based
on post-processing of verilog definitions that are used for the
node controller chip design. Although some symbol names are not
what I would chose, I would like to maintain compatibility with
the names used by the chip designers. We have a number of
cross-reference utilities & having common names is important.
