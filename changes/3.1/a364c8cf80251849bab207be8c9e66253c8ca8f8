dcb: Add dcb_ieee_getapp_mask() for drivers to query APP settings

With multiple APP entries per selector and protocol drivers
or stacks may want to pick a specific value or stripe traffic
across many priorities. Also if an APP entry in use is
deleted the stack/driver may want to choose from the existing
APP entries.

To facilitate this and avoid having duplicate code to walk
the APP ring provide a routine dcb_ieee_getapp_mask() to
return a u8 bitmask of all priorities set for the specified
selector and protocol. This routine and bitmask is a helper
for DCB kernel users.
