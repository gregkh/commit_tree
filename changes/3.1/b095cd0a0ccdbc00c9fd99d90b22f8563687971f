drm/i915: set GFX_MODE to pre-Ivybridge default value even on Ivybridge

Prior to Ivybridge, the GFX_MODE would default to 0x800, meaning that
MI_FLUSH would flush the TLBs in addition to the rest of the caches
indicated in the MI_FLUSH command.  However starting with Ivybridge, the
register defaults to 0x2800 out of reset, meaning that to invalidate the
TLB we need to use PIPE_CONTROL.  Since we're not doing that yet, go
back to the old default so things work.

v2: don't forget to actually *clear* the new bit
