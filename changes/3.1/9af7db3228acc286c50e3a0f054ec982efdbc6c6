pnfs-obj: Fix the comp_index != 0 case

There were bugs in the case of partial layout where olo_comp_index
is not zero. This used to work and was tested but one of the later
cleanup SQUASHMEs broke it and was not tested since.

Also add a dprint that specify those received layout parameters.
Everything else was already printed.
