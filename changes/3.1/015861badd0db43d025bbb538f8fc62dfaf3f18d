ext4: avoid wasted extent cache lookup if !PUNCH_OUT_EXT

This patch avoids an extraneous lookup of the extent cache
in ext4_ext_map_blocks() when the flag
EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_PUNCH_OUT_EXT is absent.

The existing logic was performing the lookup but not making
use of the result. The patch simply reverses the order of evaluation
in the condition.

Since ext4_ext_in_cache() does not initialize newex on misses, bypassing
its invocation does not introduce any new issue in this regard.
