kdb,kgdb: Allow arbitrary kgdb magic knock sequences

The first packet that gdb sends when the kernel is in kdb mode seems
to change with every release of gdb.  Instead of continuing to add
many different gdb packets, change kdb to automatically look for any
thing that looks like a gdb packet.

Example 1 cold start test:
echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger
$D#44+

Example 2 cold start test:
echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger
$3#33

The second one should re-enter kdb's shell right away and is purely a
test.
