slub: explicit list_lock taking

The allocator fastpath rework does change the usage of the list_lock.
Remove the list_lock processing from the functions that hide them from the
critical sections and move them into those critical sections.

This in turn simplifies the support functions (no __ variant needed anymore)
and simplifies the lock handling on bootstrap.

Inline add_partial since it becomes pretty simple.
