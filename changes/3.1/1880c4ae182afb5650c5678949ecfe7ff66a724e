perf, x86: Add hw_watchdog_set_attr() in a sake of nmi-watchdog on P4

Due to restriction and specifics of Netburst PMU we need a separated
event for NMI watchdog. In particular every Netburst event
consumes not just a counter and a config register, but also an
additional ESCR register.

Since ESCR registers are grouped upon counters (i.e. if ESCR is occupied
for some event there is no room for another event to enter until its
released) we need to pick up the "least" used ESCR (or the most available
one) for nmi-watchdog purposes -- so MSR_P4_CRU_ESCR2/3 was chosen.

With this patch nmi-watchdog and perf top should be able to run simultaneously.
