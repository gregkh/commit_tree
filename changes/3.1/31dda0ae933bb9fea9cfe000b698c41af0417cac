net: don't clear IFF_XMIT_DST_RELEASE in ether_setup

d88733150 introduced the IFF_SKB_TX_SHARING flag, which I unilaterally set in
ether_setup.  In doing this I didn't realize that other flags (such as
IFF_XMIT_DST_RELEASE) might be set prior to calling the ether_setup routine.
This patch changes ether_setup to or in SKB_TX_SHARING so as not to
inadvertently clear other existing flags.  Thanks to Pekka Riikonen for pointing
out my error
