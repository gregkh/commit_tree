checkpatch: validate signature styles and To: and Cc: lines

Signatures have many forms and can sometimes cause problems if not in the
correct format when using git send-email or quilt.

Try to verify the signature tags and email addresses to use the generally
accepted "Signed-off-by: Full Name <email@domain.tld>" form.
