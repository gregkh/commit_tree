ARM: add a kuser_cmpxchg64 user space helper

Some user space applications are designed around the ability to perform
atomic operations on 64 bit values.  Since this is natively possible
only with ARMv6k and above, let's provide a new kuser helper to perform
the operation with kernel supervision on pre ARMv6k hardware.
