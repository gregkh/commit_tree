cpupower: Do detect IDA (opportunistic processor performance) via cpuid

IA32-Intel Devel guide Volume 3A - 14.3.2.1
-------------------------------------------
...
Opportunistic processor performance operation can be disabled by setting bit 38 of
IA32_MISC_ENABLES. This mechanism is intended for BIOS only. If
IA32_MISC_ENABLES[38] is set, CPUID.06H:EAX[1] will return 0.

Better detect things via cpuid, this cleans up the code a bit
and the MSR parts were not working correctly anyway.
