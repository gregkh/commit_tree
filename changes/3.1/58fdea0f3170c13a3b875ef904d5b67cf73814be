dccp ccid-2: Use existing function to test for data packets

This replaces a switch statement with a test, using the equivalent
function dccp_data_packet(skb).  It also doubles the range of the field
`rx_num_data_pkts' by changing the type from `int' to `u32', avoiding
signed/unsigned comparison with the u16 field `dccps_r_ack_ratio'.
