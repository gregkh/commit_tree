ALSA: hda - Fix indep-HP path (de-)activation for VT1708* codecs

This patch fixes non-working indep-HP control on VT1708* codecs.
The problems are that via_independent_hp_put() wasn't fixed to follow
the recent change of three HP paths, and hp_indep_path didn't contain
the amp nids of mixer elements.

Together with the fixes, a few code clean-ups are done.
