drivers/rtc/rtc-s3c.c: fix no occurrence of alarm interrupt

The driver does not generate an alarm interrupt even though a time for
an alarm is set.

This results from disabling rtc_clk after setting the alarm time.

To generate an alarm interrupt the driver should maintain its enabled
state for rtc_clk the until alarm interrupt occurs.  This patch permits
generation of an alarm interrupt.
