[media] v4l2-ctrls: add v4l2_fh pointer to the set control functions

When an application changes a control you want to generate an event.
However, you want to avoid sending such an event back to the application
(file handle) that caused the change.

Add the filehandle to the various set control functions.

The filehandle isn't used yet, but the control event patches will need
this.
