powerpc: Fix device-tree matching for Apple U4 bridge

Apple Quad G5 has some oddity in it's device-tree which causes the new
generic matching code to fail to relate nodes for PCI-E devices below U4
with their respective struct pci_dev.  This breaks graphics on those
machines among others.

This fixes it using a quirk which copies the node pointer from the host
bridge for the root complex, which makes the generic code work for the
children afterward.
