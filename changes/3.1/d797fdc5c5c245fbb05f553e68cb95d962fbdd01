perf tools: Add inverted call graph report support.

Add "caller/callee" option to support inverted butterfly report,
in the inverted report (with caller option), the call graph start
from the callee's ancestor. Users can use such view to catch system's
performance bottleneck from a sysprof like view. Using this option
with specified sort order like pid gives us high level view of call
graph statistics.

Also add "-G" alias for inverted call graph.
