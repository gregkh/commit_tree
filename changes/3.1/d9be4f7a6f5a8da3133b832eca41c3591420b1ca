ipv4: Constrain UFO fragment sizes to multiples of 8 bytes

Because the ip fragment offset field counts 8-byte chunks, ip
fragments other than the last must contain a multiple of 8 bytes of
payload.  ip_ufo_append_data wasn't respecting this constraint and,
depending on the MTU and ip option sizes, could create malformed
non-final fragments.
