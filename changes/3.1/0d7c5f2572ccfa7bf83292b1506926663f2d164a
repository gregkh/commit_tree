drivers:misc:ti-st: platform hooks for chip states

Certain platform specific or Host-WiLink Interface specific actions would be
required to be taken when the chip is being enabled and after the chip is
disabled such as configuration of the mux modes for the GPIO of host connected
to the nshutdown of the chip or relinquishing UART after the chip is disabled.

Similar actions can also be taken when the chip is in deep sleep or when the
chip is awake. Performance enhancements such as configuring the host to run
faster when chip is awake and slower when chip is asleep can also be made
here.
