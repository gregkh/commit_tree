md/raid10: Improve decision on whether to fail a device with a read error.

Normally we would fail a device with a READ error.  However if doing
so causes the array to fail, it is better to leave the device
in place and just return the read error to the caller.

The current test for decide if the array will fail is overly
simplistic.
We have a function 'enough' which can tell if the array is failed or
not, so use it to guide the decision.
