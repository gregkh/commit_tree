x86,64: Simplify save_regs()

The save_regs function that saves the regs on low level
irq entry is complicated because of the fact it changes
its stack in the middle and also because it manipulates
data allocated in the caller frame and accesses there
are directly calculated from callee rsp value with the
return address in the middle of the way.

This complicates the static stack offsets calculation and
require more dynamic ones. It also needs a save/restore
of the function's return address.

To simplify and optimize this, turn save_regs() into a
macro.
