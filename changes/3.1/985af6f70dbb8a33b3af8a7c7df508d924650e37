[SCSI] isci: change sas phy timeouts from 54us to 59us

Need the following workaround in the driver for interoperability with
the older Intel SSD drives and any other SATA drive that may exhibit the
same behavior. This is a corner case where SCU speed is limited to
either 3G or 1.5G and the drive has a period of DC idle when it switches
speed during SATA speed negotiation. Workaround :change PHYTOV[31:24]
from 0x36 to 0x3B.
