drm/i915: Fix PCH port pipe select in CPT disable paths

CPT pipe select is different from previous generations (using two bits
instead of one). All of the paths from intel_disable_pch_ports were
not making this distinction.

Mode setting with pipe A turned off would then also force all outputs
on pipe B to get turned off as the disable code would mistakenly
decide that all of these outputs were on pipe A and turn them off.

This is an extension of the CPT DP disable fix (why didn't I fix this then?)
