Btrfs: stop using highmem for extent_buffers

The extent_buffers have a very complex interface where
we use HIGHMEM for metadata and try to cache a kmap mapping
to access the memory.

The next commit adds reader/writer locks, and concurrent use
of this kmap cache would make it even more complex.

This commit drops the ability to use HIGHMEM with extent buffers,
and rips out all of the related code.
