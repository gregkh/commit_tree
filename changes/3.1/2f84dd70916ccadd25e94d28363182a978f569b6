autofs4: fix debug printk warning uncovered by cleanup

The previous comit made the autofs4 debug printouts check types against
the printout format, and uncovered this bug:

  fs/autofs4/waitq.c:106:2: warning: format ‘%08lx’ expects type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 4 has type ‘autofs_wqt_t’

which is due to the insane type for wait_queue_token.  That thing should
be some fixed well-defined size (preferably just 'unsigned int' or
'u32') but for unexplained reasons it is randomly either 'unsigned long'
or 'unsigned int' depending on the architecture.

For now, cast it to 'unsigned long' for printing, the way we do
elsewhere.  Somebody else can try to explain the typedef mess.

(There's a reason we don't support excessive use of typedefs in the
kernel: it's usually just a good way of confusing yourself).
