ALSA: hda: Conexant: Allow different output types to share DAC

Headphones has stopped working for the original reported (a regression
compared to 2.6.38). This is because Speaker and Headphones share the
same DAC, in which case no Headphones volume control was created.
This patch fixes so that both Speaker and Headphones volume
controls are created in such scenario.
