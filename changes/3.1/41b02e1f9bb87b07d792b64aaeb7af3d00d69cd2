ceph: explicitly reference rename old_dentry parent dir in request

We carry a pin on the parent directory for the rename source and dest
dentries.  For the source it's r_locked_dir; we need to explicitly
reference the old_dentry parent as well, since the dentry's d_parent may
change between when the request was created and pinned and when it is
freed.
