dm table: fix discard support

Remove 'discards_supported' from the dm_table structure.  The same
information can be easily discovered from the table's target(s) in
dm_table_supports_discards().

Before this fix dm_table_supports_discards() would skip checking the
individual targets' 'discards_supported' flag if any one target in the
table didn't set num_discard_requests > 0.  Now the per-target
'discards_supported' flag is effective at insuring the final DM device
advertises discard support.  But, to be clear, targets that don't
support discards (!num_discard_requests) will not receive discard
requests.

Also DMWARN if a target sets 'discards_supported' override but forgets
to set 'num_discard_requests'.
