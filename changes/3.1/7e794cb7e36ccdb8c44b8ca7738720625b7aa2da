rtc: stmp3xxx: Remove UIE handlers

The RTC core handles UIE since 6610e08 (RTC: Rework RTC code to use
timerqueue for events), so remove the specific interrupt in this driver.
To make it work at all, enable interrupts in set_alarm() if needed. Drop
IRQF_DISABLED which is deprecated, while we are here.  Finally, add my
copyright after all these changes.
