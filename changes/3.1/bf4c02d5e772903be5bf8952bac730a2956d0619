rt2x00: reset usb devices at probe

When module is reloaded, device may fail to work, with messages:

Whereas replugging device make it functional. To solve that problem
force reset device during probe.

With patch messages are gone. Unfortunately device may sometimes
still does not operate correctly after module reload (fail to receive
data after associate), but such cases are rarer than without the patch.
