perf symbols: Synthesize anonymous mmap events

perf_event__synthesize_mmap_events does not create anonymous mmap events
even though the kernel does. As a result an already running application
with dynamically created code will not get profiled - all samples end up
in the unknown bucket.

This patch skips any entries with '[' in the name to avoid adding events
for special regions (eg the vsyscall page). All other executable mmaps
are assumed to be anonymous and an event is synthesized.
