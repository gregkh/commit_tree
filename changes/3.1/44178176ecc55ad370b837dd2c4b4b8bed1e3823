8250_pci: add support for Rosewill RC-305 4x serial port card

This patch adds support for the Rosewill RC-305 four-port PCI serial
card, and probably any other four-port serial cards based on the
Moschip MCS9865 chip, assuming that the EEPROM on the card was
programmed in accordance with Table 6 of the MCS9865 EEPROM
Application Note version 0.3 dated 16-May-2008, available from the
Moschip web site (registration required).

This patch is based on an earlier patch [1] for the SYBA 6x serial
port card by Ira W. Snyder.
