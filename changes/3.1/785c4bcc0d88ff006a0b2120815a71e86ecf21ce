ext3: Add fixed tracepoints

This commit adds fixed tracepoints to the ext3 code. It is based on ext4
tracepoints, however due to the differences of both file systems, there
are some tracepoints missing (those for delaloc and for multi-block
allocator) and there are some ext3 specific as well (for reservation
windows).

Here is a list:

ext3_free_inode
ext3_request_inode
ext3_allocate_inode
ext3_evict_inode
ext3_drop_inode
ext3_mark_inode_dirty
ext3_write_begin
