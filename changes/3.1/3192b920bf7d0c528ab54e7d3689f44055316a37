slab, slub, slob: Unify alignment definition

Every slab has its on alignment definition in include/linux/sl?b_def.h. Extract those
and define a common set in include/linux/slab.h.

SLOB: As notes sometimes we need double word alignment on 32 bit. This gives all
structures allocated by SLOB a unsigned long long alignment like the others do.

SLAB: If ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN is not set SLAB would set ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN to
zero meaning no alignment at all. Give it the default unsigned long long alignment.
