ALSA: hda - Fix independent-HP handling in patch_via.c

Fix races in handling of HP DAC and independent streams for VIA codecs.
Also, allow the HP output path without front-DAC, and removed
unnecessary activation of HP mixer elements.

This also removes the handling of shared side/HP stream; it's anyway
implemented in a broken way, so we need to re-implement the feature
later...
