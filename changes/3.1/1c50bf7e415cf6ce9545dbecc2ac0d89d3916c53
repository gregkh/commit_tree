staging: r8192e_pci: Handle duplicate PCI ID 0x10ec:0x8192 conflict with rtl8192se

There are two devices with PCI ID 0x10ec:0x8192, namely RTL8192E and
RTL8192SE. The method of distinguishing them is by the revision ID
at offset 0x8 of the PCI configuration space. If the value is 0x10,
then the device uses rtl8192se for a driver.
