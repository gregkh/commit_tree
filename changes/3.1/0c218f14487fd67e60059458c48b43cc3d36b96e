HID: wiimote: Add wiimote send function

The wiimote driver needs to send raw output reports to the wiimote
device. Otherwise we could not manage the peripherals of the wiimote
or perform memory operations on the wiimote.
We cannot use hidinput_input_event of the lowlevel hid driver, since
this does not accept raw input. Therefore, we need to use the same
function that hidraw uses to send output. Side effect is, the raw
output function is not buffered and can sleep.
