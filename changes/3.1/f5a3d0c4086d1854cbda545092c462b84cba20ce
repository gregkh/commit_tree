i915: Fix opregion notifications

opregion-based platforms will send ACPI video event 0x80 for a range of
notification types for legacy compatibility. This is interpreted as a
display switch event, which may not be appropriate in the circumstances.
When we receive such an event we should make sure that the platform is
genuinely requesting a display switch before passing that event through
to userspace.
