tmpfs: pass gfp to shmem_getpage_gfp

Make shmem_getpage() a wrapper, passing mapping_gfp_mask() down to
shmem_getpage_gfp(), which in turn passes gfp down to shmem_swp_alloc().

Change shmem_read_mapping_page_gfp() to use shmem_getpage_gfp() in the
CONFIG_SHMEM case; but leave tiny !SHMEM using read_cache_page_gfp().

Add a BUG_ON() in case anyone happens to call this on a non-shmem mapping;
though we might later want to let that case route to read_cache_page_gfp().

It annoys me to have these two almost-redundant args, gfp and fault_type:
I can't find a better way; but initialize fault_type only in shmem_fault().

Note that before, read_cache_page_gfp() was allocating i915_gem's pages
with __GFP_NORETRY as intended; but the corresponding swap vector pages
got allocated without it, leaving a small possibility of OOM.
