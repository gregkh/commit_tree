cfq-iosched: Add documentation about idling

There are always questions about why CFQ is idling on various conditions.
Recent ones is Christoph asking again why to idle on REQ_NOIDLE. His
assertion is that XFS is relying more and more on workqueues and is
concerned that CFQ idling on IO from every workqueue will impact
XFS badly.

So he suggested that I add some more documentation about CFQ idling
and that can provide more clarity on the topic and also gives an
opprotunity to poke a hole in theory and lead to improvements.

So here is my attempt at that. Any comments are welcome.
