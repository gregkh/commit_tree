PCI : ability to relocate assigned pci-resources

Currently pci-bridges are allocated enough resources to satisfy their immediate
requirements.  Any additional resource-requests fail if additional free space,
contiguous to the one already allocated, is not available. This behavior is not
reasonable since sufficient contiguous resources, that can satisfy the request,
are available at a different location.

This patch provides the ability to expand and relocate a allocated resource.

	v2: Changelog: Fixed size calculation in pci_reassign_resource()
	v3: Changelog : Split this patch. The resource.c changes are already
			upstream. All the pci driver changes are in here.
