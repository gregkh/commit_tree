net: vlan, qlcnic: make vlan_find_dev private

there is only one user of vlan_find_dev outside of the actual vlan code:
qlcnic uses it to iterate over some VLANs it knows.

let's just make vlan_find_dev private to the VLAN code and have the
iteration in qlcnic be a bit more direct. (a few rcu dereferences less
too)
