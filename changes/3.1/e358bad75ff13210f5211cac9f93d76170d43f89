PM / Runtime: Improve documentation of enable, disable and barrier

The runtime PM documentation in Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt
doesn't say that pm_runtime_enable() and pm_runtime_disable() work by
operating on power.disable_depth, which is wrong, because the
possibility of nesting disables doesn't follow from the description
of these functions.  Also, there is no description of
pm_runtime_barrier() at all in the document, which is confusing.
Improve the documentation by fixing those issues.
