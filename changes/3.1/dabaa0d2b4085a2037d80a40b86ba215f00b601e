hwmon: (max1668) Add support for tempX_fault attributes

MAX1668 and compatibles have several external temperature sensors, but only a
single FAULT status bit. If a fault occurs, the temperature reported on the
affected sensors is 127 degrees C. Use this knowledge to report fault on
external sensors.
