ASoC: Fix check for symmetric rate enforcement

The ASoC core tries to not enforce symmetric rates when
two streams open simultaneously. It does so by checking
rtd->rate being zero. This works exactly once after booting
because it is not set to zero again when the streams close.
Fix this by setting rtd->rate when no active stream is left.

[This leads to lots of warnings about not enforcing the symmetry in some
situations as there's a race in the userspace API where we know we've
got two applications but don't know what rates they want to set.
