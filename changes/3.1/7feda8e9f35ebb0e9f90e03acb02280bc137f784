x86, olpc: Add XO-1 SCI driver and power button control

The System Control Interrupt is used in the OLPC XO-1 to control various
features of the laptop. Add the driver base and the power button
functionality.

This driver can't be built as a module, because functionality added in
future patches means that some drivers need to know at boot-time whether
SCI-based functionality is available.
