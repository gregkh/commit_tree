[SCSI] hpsa: fix problem that OBDR devices are not detected

The test to detect OBDR ("One Button Disaster Recovery")
cd-rom devices was comparing against uninitialized data.

Fixed by moving the test for the device to where the
inquiry data is collected, and uninitialized variable
altogether as it wasn't really being used.
