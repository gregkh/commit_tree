usb: renesas_usbhs: modify packet queue control method

Current renesas_usbhs driver is controlling packet queue on mod_gadget.c.
But it has relationship with pipe/fifo, not host/gadget.
So, controlling USB packet queue in pipe.c/fifo.c is
more convenient than in mod_gadget.c.
This patch modify it.
