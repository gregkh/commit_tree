um: disable CMPXCHG_DOUBLE as it breaks UML build

Commit b789ef518b2 ("slub: Add cmpxchg_double_slab()") tests for
cmpxchg_double support in the SLUB code and it breaks UML builds with
SLUB.  Since UML does not support checking for CPU features, disable
CMPXCHG_DOUBLE just like CMPXCHG_LOCAL is disabled for UML.
