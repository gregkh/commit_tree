[SCSI] qla2xxx: Correct inadvertent loop state transitions during port-update handling.

Transitioning to a LOOP_UPDATE loop-state could cause the driver
to miss normal link/target processing.  LOOP_UPDATE is a crufty
artifact leftover from at time the driver performed it's own
internal command-queuing.  Safely remove this state.
