tcm_fc: Work queue based approach instead of managing own thread and event based mechanism

Problem: Changed from wake_up_interruptible -> wake_up_process and
wait_event_interruptible-> schedule_timeout_interruptible broke the FCoE
target.  Earlier approach of wake_up_interruptible was also looking at
'queue_cnt' which is not necessary, because it increment of 'queue_cnt'
with wake_up_inetrriptible / waker_up_process introduces race condition.

Fix: Instead of fixing the code which used wake_up_process and remove
'queue_cnt', using work_queue based approach is cleaner and acheives
same result. As well, work queue based approach has less programming
overhead and OS manages threads which processes work queues.
