libata: report link resume failure as KERN_WARNING instead of ERR

Link resume failure in itself isn't an error condition and may happen
regularly depending on hardware configuration.  Reporting it as
KERN_ERR makes the condition unnecessarily prominent (e.g. reported
during boot).  Use KERN_WARNING instead.
