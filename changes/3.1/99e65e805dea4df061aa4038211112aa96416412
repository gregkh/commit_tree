KVM: nVMX: No need for handle_vmx_insn function any more

Before nested VMX support, the exit handler for a guest executing a VMX
instruction (vmclear, vmlaunch, vmptrld, vmptrst, vmread, vmread, vmresume,
vmwrite, vmon, vmoff), was handle_vmx_insn(). This handler simply threw a #UD
exception. Now that all these exit reasons are properly handled (and emulate
the respective VMX instruction), nothing calls this dummy handler and it can
be removed.
