ext4: avoid eh_entries overflow before insert extent_idx

If eh_entries is equal to (or greater than) eh_max, the operation of
inserting new extent_idx will make number of entries overflow.
So check eh_entries before inserting the new extent_idx.

Although there is no bug case according the code (function
ext4_ext_insert_index is called by ext4_ext_split and ext4_ext_split
is called only if the index block has free space), the right logic
should be "lookup the capacity before insertion".
