x86: Serialize SMP bootup CMOS accesses on rtc_lock

With CPU hotplug, there is a theoretical race between other CMOS
(namely RTC) accesses and those done in the SMP secondary
processor bringup path.

I am unware of the problem having been noticed by anyone in practice,
but it would very likely be rather spurious and very hard to reproduce.
So to be on the safe side, acquire rtc_lock around those accesses.
