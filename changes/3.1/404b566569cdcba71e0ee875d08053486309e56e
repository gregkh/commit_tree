ASoC: tlv320aic3x: Add correct hw registers to Line1 cross connect muxes

Commit af46800 ("ASoC: Implement mux control sharing") revealed that
"Left Line1[L | R] Mux" and "Right Line1[L | R] Mux" widgets were pointing
to the same kcontrols and codec registers and thus soc-core falsely detected
them as shared controls. This is actually wrong since there are separate
registers in hardware that configure Line1L to RADC and Line1R to LADC cross
connects so these muxes should not be shared.
