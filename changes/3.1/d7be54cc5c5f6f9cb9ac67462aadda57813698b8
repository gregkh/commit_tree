[SCSI] bfa: FCS bug fixes.

- Added logic to initiate a PLOGI to the target, while processing a LOGO
  from the same target in Direct attach mode.
- Added logic to generate a FCCT Reject indicating unsupported command,
  upon receiving FCCT/FCGS requests.
- Added logic to set the fcpim in offline state and avoid any PRLI retries
  if a PRLI response is a reject with a reason Command Not Supported.
- Updated the FDMI Supported/Current speeds.
- Added logic to wait for the response  from the firmware before sending
  ACC to PLOGI and transitioning to subsequent states - while processing an
  Incoming PLOGI in online state.
- Added a wait state in the fcs_vport state machine - For case where
  FDISC is in progress and we get a vport delete request we wait for
  fdisc response and will transition to the appropriate state based on
  rsp status, else its causing both driver/fw resources to be not
  freed.
- Remove the fc_credit_recovery module param.
