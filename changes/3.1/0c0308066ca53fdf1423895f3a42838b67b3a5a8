NFS: Fix spurious readdir cookie loop messages

If the directory contents change, then we have to accept that the
file->f_pos value may shrink if we do a 'search-by-cookie'. In that
case, we should turn off the loop detection and let the NFS client
try to recover.

The patch also fixes a second loop detection bug by ensuring
that after turning on the ctx->duped flag, we read at least one new
cookie into ctx->dir_cookie before attempting to match with
ctx->dup_cookie.
