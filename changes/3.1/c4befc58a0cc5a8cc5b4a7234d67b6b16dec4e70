KVM: PPC: Move fields between struct kvm_vcpu_arch and kvmppc_vcpu_book3s

This moves the slb field, which represents the state of the emulated
SLB, from the kvmppc_vcpu_book3s struct to the kvm_vcpu_arch, and the
hpte_hash_[v]pte[_long] fields from kvm_vcpu_arch to kvmppc_vcpu_book3s.
This is in accord with the principle that the kvm_vcpu_arch struct
represents the state of the emulated CPU, and the kvmppc_vcpu_book3s
struct holds the auxiliary data structures used in the emulation.
