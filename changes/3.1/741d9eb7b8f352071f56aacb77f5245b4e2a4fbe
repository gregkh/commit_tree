tipc: Cleanup of message header size terminology

Performs cosmetic cleanup of the symbolic names used to specify TIPC
payload message header sizes. The revised names now more accurately
reflect the payload messages in which they can appear. In addition,
several places where these payload message symbol names were being used
to create non-payload messages have been updated to use the proper
internal message symbolic name.

No functional changes are introduced by this rework.
