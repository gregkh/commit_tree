ARM: kuser: move interface documentation out of the source code

Digging into some assembly file in order to get information about the
kuser helpers is not that convivial.  Let's move that information to
a better formatted file in Documentation/arm/ and improve on it a bit.

Thanks to Dave Martin <dave.martin@linaro.org> for the initial cleanup and
clarifications.
