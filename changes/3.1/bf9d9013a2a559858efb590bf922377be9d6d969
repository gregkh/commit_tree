xfs: add a proper transaction pointer to struct xfs_buf

Replace the typeless b_fspriv2 and the ugly macros around it with a properly
typed transaction pointer.  As a fallout the log buffer state debug checks
are also removed.  We could have kept them using casts, but as they do
not have a real purpose we can as well just remove them.
