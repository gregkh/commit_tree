r8169: Add support for D-Link 530T rev C1 (Kernel Bug 38862)

The D-Link DGE-530T rev C1 is a re-badged Realtek 8169 named DLG10028C,
unlike the previous revisions which were skge based.  It is probably
the same as the discontinued DGE-528T (0x4300) other than the PCI ID.

The PCI ID is 0x1186:0x4302.

Adding it to r8169.c where 0x1186:0x4300 is already found makes the card
be detected and work.
