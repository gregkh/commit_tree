OMAP2+: hwmod: Follow the recommended PRCM module enable sequence

On OMAP4, the PRCM recommended sequence for enabling
a module after power-on-reset is:
-1- Force clkdm to SW_WKUP
-2- Enabling the clocks
-3- Configure desired module mode to "enable" or "auto"
-4- Wait for the desired module idle status to be FUNC
-5- Program clkdm in HW_AUTO(if supported)

This sequence applies to all older OMAPs' as well,
however since they use autodeps, it makes sure that
no clkdm is in IDLE, and hence not requiring a force
SW_WKUP when a module is being enabled.

OMAP4 does not need to support autodeps, because
of the dyanamic dependency feature, wherein
the HW takes care of waking up a clockdomain from
idle and hence the module, whenever an interconnect
access happens to the given module.

Implementing the sequence for OMAP4 requires
the clockdomain handling that is currently done in
clock framework to be done as part of hwmod framework
since the step -4- above to "Wait for the desired
module idle status to be FUNC" is done as part of
hwmod framework.
