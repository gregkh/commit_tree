cifs: Do not set cifs/ntfs acl using a file handle (try #4)

Set security descriptor using path name instead of a file handle.
We can't be sure that the file handle has adequate permission to
set a security descriptor (to modify DACL).

Function set_cifs_acl_by_fid() has been removed since we can't be
sure how a file was opened for writing, a valid request can fail
if the file was not opened with two above mentioned permissions.
We could have opted to add on WRITE_DAC and WRITE_OWNER permissions
to file opens and then use that file handle but adding addtional
permissions such as WRITE_DAC and WRITE_OWNER could cause an
any open to fail.

And it was incorrect to look for read file handle to set a
security descriptor anyway.
