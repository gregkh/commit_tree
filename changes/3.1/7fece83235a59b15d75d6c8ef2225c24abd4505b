x86, ioapic: Also print Dest field

The code in setup_ioapic_irq() determines the Destination Field,
so why not also include it in the debug printk output that gets
displayed when the boot parameter "apic=debug" is used.

Before the change, "dmesg" will show:

 IOAPIC[0]: Set routing entry (8-1 -> 0x31 -> IRQ 1 Mode:0 Active:0)
 IOAPIC[0]: Set routing entry (8-2 -> 0x30 -> IRQ 0 Mode:0 Active:0)
 IOAPIC[0]: Set routing entry (8-3 -> 0x33 -> IRQ 3 Mode:0 Active:0) ...

After the change, you will see:

 IOAPIC[0]: Set routing entry (8-1 -> 0x31 -> IRQ 1 Mode:0 Active:0 Dest:0)
 IOAPIC[0]: Set routing entry (8-2 -> 0x30 -> IRQ 0 Mode:0 Active:0 Dest:0)
 IOAPIC[0]: Set routing entry (8-3 -> 0x33 -> IRQ 3 Mode:0 Active:0 Dest:0) ...
