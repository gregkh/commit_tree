job control: rename signal->group_stop and flags to jobctl and update them

signal->group_stop currently hosts mostly group stop related flags;
however, it's gonna be used for wider purposes and the GROUP_STOP_
flag prefix becomes confusing.  Rename signal->group_stop to
signal->jobctl and rename all GROUP_STOP_* flags to JOBCTL_*.

Bit position macros JOBCTL_*_BIT are defined and JOBCTL_* flags are
defined in terms of them to allow using bitops later.

While at it, reassign JOBCTL_TRAPPING to bit 22 to better accomodate
future additions.

This doesn't cause any functional change.

-v2: JOBCTL_*_BIT macros added as suggested by Linus.
