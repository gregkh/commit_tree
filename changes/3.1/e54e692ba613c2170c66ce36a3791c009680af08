kconfig: introduce specialized printer

Make conf_write_symbol() grammar agnostic to be able to use it from different
code path. These path pass a printer callback which will print a symbol's name
and its value in different format.

conf_write_symbol()'s job become mostly only to prepare a string for the
printer. This avoid to have to pass specialized flag to generic
functions
