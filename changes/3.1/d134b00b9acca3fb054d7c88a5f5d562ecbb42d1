loop: add BLK_DEV_LOOP_MIN_COUNT=%i to allow distros 0 pre-allocated loop devices

Instead of unconditionally creating a fixed number of dead loop
devices which need to be investigated by storage handling services,
even when they are never used, we allow distros start with 0
loop devices and have losetup(8) and similar switch to the dynamic
/dev/loop-control interface instead of searching /dev/loop%i for free
devices.
