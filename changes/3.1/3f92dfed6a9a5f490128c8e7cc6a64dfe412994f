ARM: kprobes: Decode 16-bit Thumb hint instructions

For hints which may have observable effects, like SEV (send event), we
use kprobe_emulate_none which emulates the hint by executing the
original instruction.

For NOP we simulate the instruction using kprobe_simulate_nop, which
does nothing. As probes execute with interrupts disabled this is also
used for hints which may block for an indefinite time, like WFE (wait
for event).
