ASoC: ssm2602: Re-enable oscillator after suspend

Currently the the internal oscillator is powered down when entering BIAS_OFF
state, but not re-enabled when going back to BIAS_STANDBY. As a result the
CODEC will stop working after suspend if the internal oscillator is used to
generate the sysclock signal. This patch fixes it by clearing the appropriate
bit in the power down register when the CODEC is re-enabled.
