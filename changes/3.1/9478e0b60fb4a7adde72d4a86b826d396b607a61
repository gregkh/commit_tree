ASoC: sh: fsi: remove pm_runtime from fsi_dai_set_fmt.

pm_runtime_get/put_sync were used to access FSI register in fsi_dai_set_fmt
which is called when ALSA probe.
But this register value will disappear after pm_runtime_put_sync
if platform is supporting RuntimePM.
To solve this issue, this patch adds new variable for format,
and remove pm_runtime_get/put_sync from fsi_dai_set_fmt.
