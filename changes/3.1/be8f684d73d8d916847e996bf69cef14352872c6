oom: make deprecated use of oom_adj more verbose

/proc/pid/oom_adj is deprecated and scheduled for removal in August 2012
according to Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt.

This patch makes the warning more verbose by making it appear as a more
serious problem (the presence of a stack trace and being multiline should
attract more attention) so that applications still using the old interface
can get fixed.

Very popular users of the old interface have been converted since the oom
killer rewrite has been introduced.  udevd switched to the
/proc/pid/oom_score_adj interface for v162, kde switched in 4.6.1, and
opensshd switched in 5.7p1.

At the start of 2012, this should be changed into a WARN() to emit all
such incidents and then finally remove the tunable in August 2012 as
scheduled.
