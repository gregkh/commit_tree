ixgbe: fix possible null buffer error

It seems that at least one PPC machine would occasionally give a (valid) 0 as
the return value from dma_map, this caused the ixgbe code to not work
correctly.  A fix is pending in the PPC tree to not return 0 from dma map, but
we can also fix the driver to make sure we don't mess up in other arches as
well.

This patch is applicable to all current stable kernels.
