perf_events: Update Intel extra regs shared constraints management

This patch improves the code managing the extra shared registers
used for offcore_response events on Intel Nehalem/Westmere. The
idea is to use static allocation instead of dynamic allocation.
This simplifies greatly the get and put constraint routines for
those events.

The patch also renames per_core to shared_regs because the same
data structure gets used whether or not HT is on. When HT is
off, those events still need to coordination because they use
a extra MSR that has to be shared within an event group.
