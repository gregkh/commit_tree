eisa/pci_eisa.c: fix BUG introduced by 005bdad7b80

While `pci_eisa_driver' still refer `pci_eisa_init', the .probe() function
should not be called after init memory release, as pointed out by commit
74b9a297. The structure is still referenced in the drivers subsystem, and can
be accesseed through sysfs, so the modpost warning is a false positive. Mark
it as such.

In the same time, the warning referenced in 005bdad7b80 did only mention
`pci_eisa_driver', not `pci_eisa_pci_tbl', so remove its marking.
