lockdep: Fix wrong assumption in match_held_lock

match_held_lock() was assuming it was being called on a lock class
that had already seen usage.

This condition was true for bug-free code using lockdep_assert_held(),
since you're in fact holding the lock when calling it. However the
assumption fails the moment you assume the assertion can fail, which
is the whole point of having the assertion in the first place.

Anyway, now that there's more lockdep_is_held() users, notably
__rcu_dereference_check(), its much easier to trigger this since we
test for a number of locks and we only need to hold any one of them to
be good.
