[CPUFREQ] Move ARM Samsung cpufreq drivers to drivers/cpufreq/

According to discussion of the ARM arch subsystem migration,
ARM cpufreq drivers move to drivers/cpufreq. So this patch
adds Kconfig.arm for ARM like x86 and adds Samsung S5PV210
and EXYNOS4210 cpufreq driver compile in there.
As a note, otherw will be moved.
