e1000e: log when swflag is cleared unexpectedly on ICH/PCH devices

Since EXTCNF_CTRL.SWFLAG (used in the ownership arbitration of shared
resources, e.g. the PHY shared between the s/w, f/w, and h/w clients)
can be cleared by any of those clients, log a debug message when
software attempts to clear it and it is already cleared unexpectedly.
And since the swflag is cleared by a hardware reset, the driver does
not need to do that, but the mutex acquired when the bit is set must
still be cleared.
