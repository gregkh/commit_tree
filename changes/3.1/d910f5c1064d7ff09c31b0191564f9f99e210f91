KVM guest: KVM Steal time registration

This patch implements the kvm bits of the steal time infrastructure.
The most important part of it, is the steal time clock. It is an
continuous clock that shows the accumulated amount of steal time
since vcpu creation. It is supposed to survive cpu offlining/onlining.
