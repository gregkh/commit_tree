Btrfs: fix wrong free space information

Btrfs subtracted the size of the allocated space twice when it allocated
the space from the bitmap in the cluster, it broke the free space information
and led to oops finally.

And this patch also fixes the bug that ctl->free_space was subtracted
without lock.
