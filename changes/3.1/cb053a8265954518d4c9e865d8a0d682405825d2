ALSA: hda - Call proper DAC-filler function for Realtek auto-parser

In alc_auto_add_multi_channel_mode(), when the primary HP workaround
is enabled, it re-initializes the DAC list but calls alc662's function
in a fixed way.  This isn't pretty suitable for other codecs, of course.

Now we call it with fill_dac function pointer so that the proper
function can be called at that point.
