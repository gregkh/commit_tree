xfs: reshuffle dir2 headers

Replace the current mess of dir2 headers with just three that have a clear
purpose:

 - xfs_dir2_format.h for all format definitions, including the inline helpers
   to access our variable size structures
 - xfs_dir2_priv.h for all prototypes that are internal to the dir2 code
   and not needed by anything outside of the directory code.  For this
   purpose xfs_da_btree.c, and phase6.c in xfs_repair are considered part
   of the directory code.
 - xfs_dir2.h for the public interface to the directory code

In addition to the reshuffle I have also update the comments to not only
match the new file structure, but also to describe the directory format
better.
