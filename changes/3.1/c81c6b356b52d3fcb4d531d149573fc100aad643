ALSA: virtuoso: fix silent analog output on Xonar Essence ST Deluxe

Commit dd203fa97bd5 (ALSA: virtuoso: remove non-working controls on
Essence ST Deluxe) made it impossible to adjust the volume after the
driver initialized it to muted.

Ensure that those DACs that can be accessed with I2C are initialized
to the same volume that is the reset default of the DAC without I2C.
