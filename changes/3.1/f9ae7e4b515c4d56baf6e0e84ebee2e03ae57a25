dcb: Add ieee_dcb_delapp() and dcb op to delete app entry

Now that we allow multiple IEEE App entries we need a way
to remove specific entries. To do this add the ieee_dcb_delapp()
routine.

Additionaly drivers may need to remove the APP entry from
their firmware tables. Add dcb ops routine to handle this.
