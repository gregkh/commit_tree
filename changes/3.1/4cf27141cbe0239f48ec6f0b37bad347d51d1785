make exec_permission(dir) really equivalent to inode_permission(dir, MAY_EXEC)

capability overrides apply only to the default case; if fs has ->permission()
that does _not_ call generic_permission(), we have no business doing them.
Moreover, if it has ->permission() that does call generic_permission(), we
have no need to recheck capabilities.

Besides, the capability overrides should apply only if we got EACCES from
acl_permission_check(); any other value (-EIO, etc.) should be returned
to caller, capabilities or not capabilities.
