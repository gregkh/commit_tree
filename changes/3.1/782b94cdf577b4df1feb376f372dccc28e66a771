block: initialise bd_super in bdget()

bd_super is currently reset to NULL in kill_block_super() so we rely on previous
users of the block_device object to initialise this value for the next user.
This quirk was exposed on RHEL5 when a third party filesystem did not always use
kill_block_super() and therefore bd_super wasn't being reset when a block_device
object was recycled within the cache.  This may not be a problem upstream but
makes sense to be defensive.
