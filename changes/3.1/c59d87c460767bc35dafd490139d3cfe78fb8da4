xfs: remove subdirectories

Use the move from Linux 2.6 to Linux 3.x as an excuse to kill the
annoying subdirectories in the XFS source code.  Besides the large
amount of file rename the only changes are to the Makefile, a few
files including headers with the subdirectory prefix, and the binary
sysctl compat code that includes a header under fs/xfs/ from
kernel/.
