xfs: convert AIL cursors to use struct list_head

The list of active AIL cursors uses a roll-your-own linked list with
special casing for the AIL push cursor. Simplify this code by
replacing the list with standard struct list_head lists, and use a
separate list_head to track the active cursors. This allows us to
treat the AIL push cursor as a generic cursor rather than as a
special case, further simplifying the code.

Further, fix the duplicate push cursor initialisation that the
special case handling was hiding, and clean up all the comments
around the active cursor list handling.
