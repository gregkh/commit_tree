backlight: Declare backlight_types[] const

Since backlight_types[] isn't modified, let's declare it const.  That
was probably the intention of the author of commit bb7ca747f8d6
("backlight: add backlight type"), via which the "const char const *"
construct was introduced.  The duplicate const was detected by sparse.
