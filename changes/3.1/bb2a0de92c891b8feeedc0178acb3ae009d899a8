memcg: consolidate memory cgroup lru stat functions

In mm/memcontrol.c, there are many lru stat functions as..

  mem_cgroup_zone_nr_lru_pages
  mem_cgroup_node_nr_file_lru_pages
  mem_cgroup_nr_file_lru_pages
  mem_cgroup_node_nr_anon_lru_pages
  mem_cgroup_nr_anon_lru_pages
  mem_cgroup_node_nr_unevictable_lru_pages
  mem_cgroup_nr_unevictable_lru_pages
  mem_cgroup_node_nr_lru_pages
  mem_cgroup_nr_lru_pages
  mem_cgroup_get_local_zonestat

Some of them are under #ifdef MAX_NUMNODES >1 and others are not.
This seems bad. This patch consolidates all functions into

  mem_cgroup_zone_nr_lru_pages()
  mem_cgroup_node_nr_lru_pages()
  mem_cgroup_nr_lru_pages()

For these functions, "which LRU?" information is passed by a mask.

example:
  mem_cgroup_nr_lru_pages(mem, BIT(LRU_ACTIVE_ANON))

And I added some macro as ALL_LRU, ALL_LRU_FILE, ALL_LRU_ANON.

example:
  mem_cgroup_nr_lru_pages(mem, ALL_LRU)

BTW, considering layout of NUMA memory placement of counters, this patch seems
to be better.

Now, when we gather all LRU information, we scan in following orer
    for_each_lru -> for_each_node -> for_each_zone.

This means we'll touch cache lines in different node in turn.

After patch, we'll scan
    for_each_node -> for_each_zone -> for_each_lru(mask)

Then, we'll gather information in the same cacheline at once.
