jme: Fix unmap error (Causing system freeze)

This patch add the missing dma_unmap().
Which solved the critical issue of system freeze on heavy load.

Michal Miroslaw's rejected patch:
[PATCH v2 10/46] net: jme: convert to generic DMA API
Pointed out the issue also, thank you Michal.
But the fix was incorrect. It would unmap needed address
when low memory.

Got lots of feedback from End user and Gentoo Bugzilla.

Thank you all. :)
