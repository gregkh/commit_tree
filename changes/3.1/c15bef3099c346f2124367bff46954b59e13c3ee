mmap: fix and tidy up overcommit page arithmetic

- shmem pages are not immediately available, but they are not
  potentially available either, even if we swap them out, they will just
  relocate from memory into swap, total amount of immediate and
  potentially available memory is not going to be affected, so we
  shouldn't count them as potentially free in the first place.

- nr_free_pages() is not an expensive operation anymore, there is no
  need to split the decision making in two halves and repeat code.
