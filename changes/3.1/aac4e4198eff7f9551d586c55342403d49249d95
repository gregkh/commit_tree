hfsplus: Add additional range check to handle on-disk corruptions

'recoff' is read from disk and used for an argument to memcpy, so if
the value read from disk is larger than the page size, it result to
"general protection fault". This patch add additional range check for
the value, so that disk fuzz won't cause such fault.
