KVM guest: Add a pv_ops stub for steal time

This patch adds a function pointer in one of the many paravirt_ops
structs, to allow guests to register a steal time function. Besides
a steal time function, we also declare two jump_labels. They will be
used to allow the steal time code to be easily bypassed when not
in use.
