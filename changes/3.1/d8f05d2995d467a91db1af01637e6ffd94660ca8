md/raid1: record badblocks found during resync etc.

If we find a bad block while writing as part of resync/recovery we
need to report that back to raid1d which must record the bad block,
or fail the device.

Similarly when fixing a read error, a further error should just
record a bad block if possible rather than failing the device.
