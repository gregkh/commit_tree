[S390] kvm: extension capability for new address space layout

598841ca9919d008b520114d8a4378c4ce4e40a1 ([S390] use gmap address
spaces for kvm guest images) changed kvm on s390 to use a separate
address space for kvm guests. We can now put KVM guests anywhere
in the user address mode with a size up to 8PB - as long as the
memory is 1MB-aligned. This change was done without KVM extension
capability bit.
The change was added after 3.0, but we still have a chance to add
a feature bit before 3.1 (keeping the releases in a sane state).
We use number 71 to avoid collisions with other pending kvm patches
as requested by Alexander Graf.
