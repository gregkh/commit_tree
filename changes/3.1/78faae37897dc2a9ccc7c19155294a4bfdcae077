target: Make transport_lookup_cmd_lun() locking IRQ-safe

transport_lookup_cmd_lun() may be called from interrupt context (eg
tcm_loop_allocate_core_cmd() calls it, and it has a comment that says,
"Can be called from interrupt context"), so it needs to use
spin_lock_irqsave() instead of spin_lock_irq() to avoid enabling
interrupts at the wrong time.

(And indeed the last set of lock operations, on lun_cmd_lock, were
already using spin_lock_irqsave(), so we just need to fix the other
two locks we take)
