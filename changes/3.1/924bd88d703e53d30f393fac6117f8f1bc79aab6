Staging: zram: allow partial page operations

Commit 7b19b8d45b216ff3186f066b31937bdbde066f08 (zram: Prevent overflow
in logical block size) introduced ZRAM_LOGICAL_BLOCK_SIZE constant to
prevent overflow of logical block size on 64k page kernel.
However, the current implementation of zram only allow operation on block
of the same size as a page. That makes theorically legit 4k requests fail
on 64k page kernel.

This patch makes zram allow operation on partial pages. Basically, it
means we still do operations on full pages internally, but only copy the
relevent segments from/to the user memory.
