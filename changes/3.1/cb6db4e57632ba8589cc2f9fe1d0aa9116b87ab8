btrfs: btrfs_permission's RO check shouldn't apply to device nodes

This patch tightens the read-only access checks in btrfs_permission to
 match the constraints in inode_permission. Currently, even though the
 device node itself will be unmodified, read-write access to device nodes
 is denied to when the device node resides on a read-only subvolume or a
 is a file that has been marked read-only by the btrfs conversion utility.

 With this patch applied, the check only affects regular files,
 directories, and symlinks. It also restructures the code a bit so that
 we don't duplicate the MAY_WRITE check for both tests.
