btrfs: make btrfs_set_root_node void

This is fairly trivial - btrfs_set_root_node() - always returns zero so we
can just make it void.  All callers ignore the return code now anyway.  I
also made sure to check that none of the functions that
btrfs_set_root_node() calls returns an error that we might have needed to
catch and pass back.
