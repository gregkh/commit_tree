perf tools: Fix endian conversion reading event attr from file header

The perf_event_attr struct has two __u32's at the top and
they need to be swapped individually.

With this change I was able to analyze a perf.data collected in a
32-bit PPC VM on an x86 system. I tested both 32-bit and 64-bit
binaries for the Intel analysis side; both read the PPC perf.data
file correctly.

-v2:
 - changed the existing perf_event__attr_swap() to swap only elements
   of perf_event_attr and exported it for use in swapping the
   attributes in the file header
 - updated swap_ops used for processing events
