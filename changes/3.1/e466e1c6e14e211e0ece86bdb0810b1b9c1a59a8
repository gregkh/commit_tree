[SCSI] mptfusion : Added check for SILI bit in READ_6 CDB for DATA UNDERRUN ERRATA

When READ_6 command is issued, the setting of SILI Bit in CDB is confirmed and
if SILI bit is off, the processing of relavent Errata is executed.

Earlier we did not have check for SILI bit in READ_6 CDB.
As described in "ssc-r22", Now Driver is checking SILI bit for READ_6.
