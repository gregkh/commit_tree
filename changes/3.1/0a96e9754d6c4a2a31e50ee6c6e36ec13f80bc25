[SCSI] lpfc 8.3.25: PCI and SR-IOV Fixes

PCI and SR-IOV Fixes

- Call pci_save_state after the pci_restore_state completes.
- After calling pci_enable_pcie_error_reporting() and checking the return
  value for logging messages from rc, reset rc to 0 to it will not later be
  interpreted for error.
- Read PCI config space SR-IOV capability to get the number of VFs supported.
- Check for the PF's supported number of VFs before invoking PCI enable sriov
  API call and log error message that user requested number of VFs is beyond
  the PF capability if such request is passed in.
- Added check for Physical function with Virtual Functions attached. If so,
  first disable all the VFs before proceeding to device reset.
