mm: page_alloc: increase __GFP_BITS_SHIFT to include __GFP_OTHER_NODE

__GFP_OTHER_NODE is used for NUMA allocations on behalf of other nodes.
It's supposed to be passed through from the page allocator to
zone_statistics(), but it never gets there as gfp_allowed_mask is not
wide enough and masks out the flag early in the allocation path.

The result is an accounting glitch where successful NUMA allocations
by-agent are not properly attributed as local.

Increase __GFP_BITS_SHIFT so that it includes __GFP_OTHER_NODE.
