tun: do not put self in waitq if doing a nonblock read

Perf shows a relatively high rate (about 8%) race in
spin_lock_irqsave() when doing netperf between external host and
guest. It's mainly becuase the lock contention between the
tun_do_read() and tun_xmit_skb(), so this patch do not put self into
waitqueue to reduce this kind of race. After this patch, it drops to
4%.
