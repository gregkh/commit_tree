fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c: fix pgoff alignment checking on 32-bit

This:

    vma->vm_pgoff & ~(huge_page_mask(h) >> PAGE_SHIFT)

is incorrect on 32-bit.  It causes us to & the pgoff with something that
looks like this (for a 4m hugepage): 0xfff003ff.  The mask should be
flipped and *then* shifted, to give you 0x0000_03fff.
