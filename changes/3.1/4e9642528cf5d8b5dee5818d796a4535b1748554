omap: ZOOM: QUART: Request reset GPIO

Reset GPIO (OMAP_GPIO_152) for QUART in zoom2/zoom3 debug-board is
not requested at all. This would lead to problems if this GPIO is
wrongly requested. Hence request OMAP GPIO 152 for QUART RESET but
do not apply a reset pulse as it would reset QUART and
disturb the QUART settings.
