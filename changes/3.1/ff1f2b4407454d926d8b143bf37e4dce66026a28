Btrfs: fix oops while writing data to SSD partitions

Here I have a two SSD-partitions btrfs, and they are defaultly set to
"data=raid0, metadata=raid1", then I try to fill my btrfs partition
till "No space left on device", via "dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/btrfs/tmp".

I get an oops panic from kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:5199!, which
refers to find_free_extent's
BUG_ON(index != get_block_group_index(block_group));

In SSD mode, in order to find enough space to alloc, we may check the
block_group cache which has been checked sometime before, but the index is not
updated, where it hits the BUG_ON.
