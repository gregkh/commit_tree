cifs: simplify refcounting for oplock breaks

Currently, we take a sb->s_active reference and a cifsFileInfo reference
when an oplock break workqueue job is queued. This is unnecessary and
more complicated than it needs to be. Also as Al points out,
deactivate_super has non-trivial locking implications so it's best to
avoid that if we can.

Instead, just cancel any pending oplock breaks for this filehandle
synchronously in cifsFileInfo_put after taking it off the lists.
That should ensure that this job doesn't outlive the structures it
depends on.
