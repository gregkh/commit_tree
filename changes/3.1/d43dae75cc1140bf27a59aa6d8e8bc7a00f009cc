[media] marvell-cam: core code reorganization

This code shows signs of having been mucked with over the last five years
or so; things were kind of mixed up.  This patch reorders functions into a
more rational organization which, with luck, will facilitate making the
buffer modes selectable at configuration time.  Code movement only: no
functional changes here.
