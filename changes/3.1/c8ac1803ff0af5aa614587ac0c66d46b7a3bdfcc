md/raid5: unite handle_stripe_dirtying5 and handle_stripe_dirtying6

RAID6 is only allowed to choose 'reconstruct-write' while RAID5 is
also allow 'read-modify-write'
Apart from this difference, handle_stripe_dirtying[56] are nearly
identical.  So resolve these differences and create just one function.
