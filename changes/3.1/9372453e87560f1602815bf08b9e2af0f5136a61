    ixgbe: DCB, further cleanups to app configuration

Removed the getapp() routines from ixgbe because they are no
longer needed. It also allowed the set hardware routines to
use both IEEE 802.1Qaz app types and CEE app types. This
added code to do bit shifting in the IEEE case.

This patch reverts the checks and handles the IEEE case
from the setapp entry point. I prefer this because it
keeps the two paths from having to be aware of the DCB
mode. This resolves a bug where I missed setting the
selector bit in the IEEE spec value and left it in the
CEE value. Now that they are separate routines these types
of errors should not occur.
