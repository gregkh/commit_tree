ARM: Fix build errors caused by adding generic macros

Commit 66a625a (ARM: mm: proc-macros: Add generic proc/cache/tlb struct
definition macros) introduced build errors when PM_SLEEP is not enabled.
The per-CPU do_suspend/do_resume functions are defined via the
preprocessor to constant 0.  However, the macros which use these were
converted to assembly, resulting in undefined references to these
functions.  Fix that by moving the ! ifdef section into proc-macros.S
and deleting it from all effected proc-*.S files.
