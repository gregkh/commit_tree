[SCSI] fcoe: Round-robin based selection of CPU for post-processing of incoming commands

Problem: Earlier mechanism of selection of CPU was, to select the same CPU
which has received incoming request. Hence in case of rx_id = 0xFFFF,
request was always posted to same NetRx queue, hence only 1 CPU is utilized
for handling the command. It was also causing problem of "running out of
exchanges from per CPU pool of exchanges (in case of DDP offload)

Fix: Implemented new algo. to select CPU for post-processing of
incoming commands when rx_id is unknown. This is simple Round robin
algo. for CPU selection.
