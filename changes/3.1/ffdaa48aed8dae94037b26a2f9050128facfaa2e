ASoC: Suppress restore of default register values for rbtree cache sync

Currently the rbtree code will write out the entire register map when
doing a cache sync which is wasteful and will slow things down. Check
to see if the value we're about to write is the default and don't bother
restoring it if it is, either the value will have been retained or the
device will have been reset and holds the value already.

We should really store the defaults in the nodes but this resolves the
immediate issue.
