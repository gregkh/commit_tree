Btrfs: reduce extent_state lock contention for metadata

For metadata buffers that don't straddle pages (all of them), btrfs
can safely use the page uptodate bits and extent_buffer uptodate bit
instead of needing to use the extent_state tree.

This greatly reduces contention on the state tree lock.
