mac80211: fix missing sta_lock in __sta_info_destroy

Since my commit 34e895075e21be3e21e71d6317440d1ee7969ad0
("mac80211: allow station add/remove to sleep") there is
a race in mac80211 when it clears the TIM bit because a
sleeping station disconnected, the spinlock isn't held
around the relevant code any more. Use the right API to
acquire the spinlock correctly.
