[S390] move sie code to entry.S

The entry to / exit from sie has subtle dependencies to the first level
interrupt handler. Move the sie assembler code to entry64.S and replace
the SIE_HOOK callback with a test and the new _TIF_SIE bit.
In addition this patch fixes several problems in regard to the check for
the_TIF_EXIT_SIE bits. The old code checked the TIF bits before executing
the interrupt handler and it only modified the instruction address if it
pointed directly to the sie instruction. In both cases it could miss
a TIF bit that normally would cause an exit from the guest and would
reenter the guest context.
