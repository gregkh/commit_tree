can: bfin_can: simplify xmit id1 setup

If we look closely, the 4 writes to TRANSMIT_CHL.id1 can be collapsed
down into much simpler code.  So do just that.

This also fixes a build failure due to the I/O macros no longer
getting pulled in.  Their minor (and accidental) usage here gets
dropped as part of the unification.
