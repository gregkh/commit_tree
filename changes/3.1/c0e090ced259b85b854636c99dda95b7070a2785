xfs: consolidate & clarify mount sanity checks

Pavol pointed out that there is one silent error case in the mount
path, and that others are rather uninformative.

I've taken Pavol's suggested patch and extended it a bit to also:

* fix a message which says "turned off" but actually errors out
* consolidate the vaguely differentiated "SB sanity check [12]"
  messages, and hexdump the superblock for analysis
