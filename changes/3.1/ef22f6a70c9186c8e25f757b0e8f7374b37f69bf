backlight: set backlight type and max_brightness before backlights are registered

Since commit a19a6ee "backlight: Allow properties to be passed at
registration" and commit bb7ca74 "backlight: add backlight type", we can
set backlight type and max_brightness before backlights are registered.
Some newly added drivers did not set it properly, let's fix it.
