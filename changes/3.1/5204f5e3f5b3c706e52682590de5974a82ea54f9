regmap: Remove bitrotted module_put()s

The conversion to per bus type registration functions means we don't need
to do module_get()s to hold the bus types in memory (their users will link
to them) so we removed all those calls. This left module_put() calls in
the cleanup paths which aren't needed and which cause unbalanced puts if
we ever try to unload anything.
