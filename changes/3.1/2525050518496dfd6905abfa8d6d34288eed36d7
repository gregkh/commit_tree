ALSA: hda - Re-implementation of VIA Independent-HP sharing with side stream

This patch adds the re-implementation of Independent-HP mode in the
case where the DAC is shared between HP and side-channel streams.
Now the driver tries to parse the output-path using the pre-parsed
side-channel DAC for the independent HP output, too.

When a playback PCM stream is opened with this shared mode, the
Independent-HP mixer switch can't be changed for avoiding the conflict,
thus it returns -EBUSY error.

One remaining unintuitive issue is that the DAC volume is still
controlled as "Side" volume although it's shared by both independent-HP
and side streams.
