ALSA: fm801: Fix double free in case of error in tuner detection

Commit 9676001559fce06e37c7dc230ab275f605556176
("ALSA: fm801: add error handling if auto-detect fails") added
incorrect error handling.

Once we have successfully called snd_device_new(), the cleanup
function fm801_free() will automatically be called by snd_card_free()
and we must *not* also call fm801_free() directly.
