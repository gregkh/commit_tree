xen/balloon: memory hotplug support for Xen balloon driver

Memory hotplug support for Xen balloon driver.  It should be mentioned
that hotplugged memory is not onlined automatically.  It should be onlined
by user through standard sysfs interface.

Memory could be hotplugged in following steps:

  1) dom0: xl mem-max <domU> <maxmem>
     where <maxmem> is >= requested memory size,

  2) dom0: xl mem-set <domU> <memory>
     where <memory> is requested memory size; alternatively memory
     could be added by writing proper value to
     /sys/devices/system/xen_memory/xen_memory0/target or
     /sys/devices/system/xen_memory/xen_memory0/target_kb on dumU,

  3) domU: for i in /sys/devices/system/memory/memory*/state; do \
             [ "`cat "$i"`" = offline ] && echo online > "$i"; done

Memory could be onlined automatically on domU by adding following line to
udev rules:

  SUBSYSTEM=="memory", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/bin/sh -c '[ -f /sys$devpath/state ] && echo online > /sys$devpath/state'"

In that case step 3 should be omitted.
