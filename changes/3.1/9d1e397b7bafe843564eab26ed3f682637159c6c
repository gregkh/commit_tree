[CIFS] Fix first time message on mount, ntlmv2 upgrade delayed to 3.2

Microsoft has a bug with ntlmv2 that requires use of ntlmssp, but
we didn't get the required information on when/how to use ntlmssp to
old (but once very popular) legacy servers (various NT4 fixpacks
for example) until too late to merge for 3.1.  Will upgrade
to NTLMv2 in NTLMSSP in 3.2
