pcmcia: add PCMCIA_DEVICE_MANF_CARD_PROD_ID3

This is needed to match wireless cards with Intersil firmware that have
ID 0x0156:0x0002 and the third ID "Version 01.02".  Such cards are
currently matched by orinoco_cs, which doesn't support WPA.  They should
be matched by hostap_cs.

The first and the second product ID vary widely, so there are few users
with some particular IDs.  Of those, very few can submit a patch for
hostap_cs or write a useful bugreport.  It's still important to support
their hardware properly.

With PCMCIA_DEVICE_MANF_CARD_PROD_ID3, it should be possible to cover
the remaining Intersil based designs that kept the numeric ID and the
"version" of the reference design.
