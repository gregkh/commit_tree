Btrfs: fix deadlock when throttling transactions

Hit this nice little deadlock.  What happens is this

__btrfs_end_transaction with throttle set, --use_count so it equals 0
  btrfs_commit_transaction
    <somebody else actually manages to start the commit>
    btrfs_end_transaction --use_count so now its -1 <== BAD
      we just return and wait on the transaction

This is bad because we just return after our use_count is -1 and don't let go
of our num_writer count on the transaction, so the guy committing the
transaction just sits there forever.  Fix this by inc'ing our use_count if we're
going to call commit_transaction so that if we call btrfs_end_transaction it's
valid.  Thanks,
