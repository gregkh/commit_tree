mmc: block: add handling for two parallel block requests in issue_rw_rq

Change mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq() to become asynchronous.
The execution flow looks like this:

* The mmc-queue calls issue_rw_rq(), which sends the request
  to the host and returns back to the mmc-queue.
* The mmc-queue calls issue_rw_rq() again with a new request.
* This new request is prepared in issue_rw_rq(), then it waits for
  the active request to complete before pushing it to the host.
* When the mmc-queue is empty it will call issue_rw_rq() with a NULL
  req to finish off the active request without starting a new request.
