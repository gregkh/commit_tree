thermal: make THERMAL_HWMON implementation fully internal

THERMAL_HWMON is implemented inside the thermal_sys driver and has no
effect on drivers implementing thermal zones, so they shouldn't see
anything related to it in <linux/thermal.h>.  Making the THERMAL_HWMON
implementation fully internal has two advantages beyond the cleaner
design:

* This avoids rebuilding all thermal drivers if the THERMAL_HWMON
  implementation changes, or if CONFIG_THERMAL_HWMON gets enabled or
  disabled.

* This avoids breaking the thermal kABI in these cases too, which should
  make distributions happy.

The only drawback I can see is slightly higher memory fragmentation, as
the number of kzalloc() calls will increase by one per thermal zone.  But
I doubt it will be a problem in practice, as I've never seen a system with
more than two thermal zones.
