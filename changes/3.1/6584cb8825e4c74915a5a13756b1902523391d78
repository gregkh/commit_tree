ARM i.MX dma: Fix burstsize settings

dmaengine expects the maxburst parameter in words, not bytes.
The imxdma driver and its users do this wrong. Fix this.

As a side note the imx-pcm-dma-mx2 driver was 'fixed' to work
with imx-dma. This broke the driver with imx-sdma support which
correctly takes the maxburst parameter in words. This patch
puts the sdma based sound back to work.
