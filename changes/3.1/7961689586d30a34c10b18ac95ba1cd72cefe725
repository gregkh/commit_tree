bnx2x: Broken self-test in SF mode on 578xx

This patch fixes both the failure in the self-test on 578xx
and a hole in a parity recovery flow that this failure
has discovered:
 - internal 'pending' state in a VLAN_MAC object wasn't been cleared
when the object state change was called with DRV_ONLY flag, which in
particular happens when a parity error happens during the self-test.
 - bp->sp_state wasn't cleared in the similar circumstances as described
above.
