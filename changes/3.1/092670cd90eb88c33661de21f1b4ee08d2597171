[S390] Use gmap translation for accessing guest memory

This patch removes kvm-s390 internal assumption of a linear mapping
of guest address space to user space. Previously, guest memory was
translated to user addresses using a fixed offset (gmsor). The new
code uses gmap_fault to resolve guest addresses.
