usb: renesas_usbhs: tifyup packet start timing

packet transfer timing are controlled in mod_gadget on current renesas_usbhs,
and this style will be imitated on mod_host.
But it need not be managed with host/gadget if it is general transfer.
By this patch, the packet transfer timing is managed in fifo.c
