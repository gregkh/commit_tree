target: Add transport_handle_cdb_direct optimization

This patch adds a transport_handle_cdb_direct() optimization for mapping
and queueing tasks directly from within fabric processing context by calling
the newly exported transport_generic_new_cmd().  This currently expects to
be called from process context only, and will fail if called within interrupt
context.

This patch also leaves transport_generic_handle_cdb() unmodified for the
moment to function as expected with existing tcm_fc and ib_srpt fabrics,
and will be removed once these have been converted and tested with v4.1
code using transport_handle_cdb_direct().

Based on Andy's original patch here:

[PATCH 39/42] target: Call transport_new_cmd instead of adding to cmd queue
