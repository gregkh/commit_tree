ARM: kprobes: Add hooks to override singlestep()

When a probe fires we must single-step the instruction which was
replaced by a breakpoint. As the steps to do this vary between ARM and
Thumb instructions we need a way to customise single-stepping.

This is done by adding a new hook called insn_singlestep to
arch_specific_insn which is initialised by the instruction decoding
functions.

These single-step hooks must update PC and call the instruction handler.
For Thumb instructions an additional step of updating ITSTATE is needed.
We do this after calling the handler because some handlers will need to
test if they are running in an IT block.
