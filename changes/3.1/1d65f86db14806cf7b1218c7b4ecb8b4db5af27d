mm: preallocate page before lock_page() at filemap COW

Currently we are keeping faulted page locked throughout whole __do_fault
call (except for page_mkwrite code path) after calling file system's fault
code.  If we do early COW, we allocate a new page which has to be charged
for a memcg (mem_cgroup_newpage_charge).

This function, however, might block for unbounded amount of time if memcg
oom killer is disabled or fork-bomb is running because the only way out of
the OOM situation is either an external event or OOM-situation fix.

In the end we are keeping the faulted page locked and blocking other
processes from faulting it in which is not good at all because we are
basically punishing potentially an unrelated process for OOM condition in
a different group (I have seen stuck system because of ld-2.11.1.so being
locked).

We can do test easily.

 % cgcreate -g memory:A
 % cgset -r memory.limit_in_bytes=64M A
 % cgset -r memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes=64M A
 % cd kernel_dir; cgexec -g memory:A make -j

Then, the whole system will live-locked until you kill 'make -j'
by hands (or push reboot...) This is because some important page in a
a shared library are locked.

Considering again, the new page is not necessary to be allocated
with lock_page() held. And usual page allocation may dive into
long memory reclaim loop with holding lock_page() and can cause
very long latency.

There are 3 ways.
  1. do allocation/charge before lock_page()
     Pros. - simple and can handle page allocation in the same manner.
             This will reduce holding time of lock_page() in general.
     Cons. - we do page allocation even if ->fault() returns error.

  2. do charge after unlock_page(). Even if charge fails, it's just OOM.
     Pros. - no impact to non-memcg path.
     Cons. - implemenation requires special cares of LRU and we need to modify
             page_add_new_anon_rmap()...

  3. do unlock->charge->lock again method.
     Pros. - no impact to non-memcg path.
     Cons. - This may kill LOCK_PAGE_RETRY optimization. We need to release
             lock and get it again...

This patch moves "charge" and memory allocation for COW page
before lock_page(). Then, we can avoid scanning LRU with holding
a lock on a page and latency under lock_page() will be reduced.

Then, above livelock disappears.
