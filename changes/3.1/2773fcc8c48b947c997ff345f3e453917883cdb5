powerpc: Move free_initmem to common code

The free_initmem function is basically duplicated in mm/init_32,
and init_64, and is moved to the common 32/64-bit mm/mem.c.

All other sections except init were removed in v2.6.15 by
6c45ab992e4299c869fb26427944a8f8ea177024 (powerpc: Remove section
free() and linker script bits), and therefore the bulk of the executed
code is identical.

This patch also removes updating ppc_md.progress to NULL in the powermac
late_initcall.
