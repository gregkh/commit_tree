ASoC: STA32x: Add mixer controls for biquad coefficients

The STA32x has a number of preset EQ settings, but also
allows full user control of the biquad filter coeffcients
(when "Automode EQ" is set to "User").
Each biquad has five signed, 24bit, fixed-point coefficients
representing the range -1...1.  The five biquad coefficients
can be uploaded in one atomic operation into on-chip
coefficient RAM.
There are also a few prescale, postscale and mixing
coefficients, in the same numeric format and range
(a negative coefficient inverts phase).

These coefficients are made available as SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_TYPE_BYTES
mixer controls.
