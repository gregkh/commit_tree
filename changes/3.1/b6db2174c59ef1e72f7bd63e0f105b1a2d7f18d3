dcb: Add ieee_dcb_setapp() to be used for IEEE 802.1Qaz APP data

This adds a setapp routine for IEEE802.1Qaz encoded APP data types.
The IEEE 802.1Qaz spec encodes the priority bits differently and
allows for multiple APP data entries of the same selector and
protocol. Trying to force these to use the same set routines was
becoming tedious. Furthermore, userspace could probably enforce
the correct semantics, but expecting drivers to do this seems
error prone in the firmware case.

For these reasons add ieee_dcb_setapp() that understands the
IEEE 802.1Qaz encoded form.
