Revert "[media] DVB: dvb_frontend: off by one in dtv_property_dump()"

This reverts commit a3e4adf274f86b2363fedaa964297cb38526cef0.

As pointed by Andread Oberritter <obi@linuxtv.org>:

	That's wrong, because the array size is DTV_MAX_COMMAND + 1.
	Using the ARRAY_SIZE macro instead might reduce the confusion.

Also, changeset 3995223038 already fixed this issue.
