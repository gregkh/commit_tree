writeback: remove .nonblocking and .encountered_congestion

Remove two unused struct writeback_control fields:

	.encountered_congestion	(completely unused)
	.nonblocking		(never set, checked/showed in XFS,NFS/btrfs)

The .for_background check in nfs_write_inode() is also removed btw,
as .for_background implies WB_SYNC_NONE.
