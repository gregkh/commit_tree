staging: fix comedi NI labpc driver build when ISA_DMA_API is not enabled

Fix ni_labpc.c to build when CONFIG_ISA_DMA_API is not enabled.

This is a driver that supports both ISA and PCI devices.
It now builds when for PCI-only support or for both
ISA and PCI device support.
(It does not support ISA-only without PCI.)
