backing-dev: use synchronize_rcu_expedited instead of synchronize_rcu

backing-dev: use synchronize_rcu_expedited instead of synchronize_rcu

synchronize_rcu sleeps several timer ticks. synchronize_rcu_expedited is
much faster.

With 100Hz timer frequency, when we remove 10000 block devices with
"dmsetup remove_all" command, it takes 27 minutes. With this patch,
removing 10000 block devices takes only 15 seconds.
