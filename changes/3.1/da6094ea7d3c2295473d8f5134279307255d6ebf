ALSA: snd_usb_caiaq: track submitted output urbs

The snd_usb_caiaq driver currently assumes that output urbs are serviced
in time and doesn't track when and whether they are given back by the
USB core. That usually works fine, but due to temporary limitations of
the XHCI stack, we faced that urbs were submitted more than once with
this approach.

As it's no good practice to fire and forget urbs anyway, this patch
introduces a proper bit mask to track which requests have been submitted
and given back.

That alone however doesn't make the driver work in case the host
controller is broken and doesn't give back urbs at all, and the output
stream will stop once all pre-allocated output urbs are consumed. But
it does prevent crashes of the controller stack in such cases.

See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40702 for more details.
