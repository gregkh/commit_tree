spi/ep93xx: add DMA support

This patch adds DMA support for the EP93xx SPI driver. By default the DMA is
not enabled but it can be enabled by setting ep93xx_spi_info.use_dma to true
in board configuration file.

Note that the SPI driver still uses PIO for small transfers (<= 8 bytes) for
performance reasons.
