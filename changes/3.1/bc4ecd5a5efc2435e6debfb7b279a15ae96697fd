x86, olpc: EC SCI wakeup mask functionality

Update the EC SCI masks with recent additions.

Add functions to query SCI events and set the wakeup mask, to be used by
followup patches.

Add functions to tweak an event mask used to select certain EC events as
a system wakeup source. Also add a function to determine if EC wakeup
functionality is available, as this depends on child drivers (different
for each laptop model) to configure the SCI interrupt.
