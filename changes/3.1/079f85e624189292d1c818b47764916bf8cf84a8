x86, build: Do not set the root_dev field in bzImage

This has been obsoleted by the root= commandline and the rdev utility
for many, many years.  People who still depend on this will surely
have a copy of the rdev utility around, the rest of the world gets rid
of another piece of buildhost-dependent data in the build. Thanks to
Paul Bolle for the build.c cleanup.
