[media] Stop using linux/version.h on the remaining video drivers

Standardize the remaining video drivers to return the API version
for the VIDIOC_QUERYCAP version, instead of a per-driver version.

Those drivers had the version updated more recently or are SoC
drivers. Even so, it doesn't sound a good idea to keep a per-driver
version control, so, let's use the per-subsystem version control
instead.
