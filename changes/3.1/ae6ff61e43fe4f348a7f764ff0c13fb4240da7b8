ALSA: asihpi - off by one in asihpi_hpi_ioctl()

"adapter" is used as an array index in the adapters[] array so
the off by one would make us read past the end.

1c073b67979 "ALSA: asihpi - Remove spurious adapter index check"
reverted Dan Rosenberg's check that would have prevented the
overflow here.
