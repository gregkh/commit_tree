watchdog: WatchDog Timer Driver Core - Add basic framework

The WatchDog Timer Driver Core is a framework
that contains the common code for all watchdog-driver's.
It also introduces a watchdog device structure and the
operations that go with it.

This is the introduction of this framework. This part
supports the minimal watchdog userspace API (or with
other words: the functionality to use /dev/watchdog's
open, release and write functionality as defined in
the simplest watchdog API). Extra functionality will
follow in the next set of patches.
