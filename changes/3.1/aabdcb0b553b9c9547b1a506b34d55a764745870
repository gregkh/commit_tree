can bcm: fix tx_setup off-by-one errors

This patch fixes two off-by-one errors that canceled each other out.
Checking for the same condition two times in bcm_tx_timeout_tsklet() reduced
the count of frames to be sent by one. This did not show up the first time
tx_setup is invoked as an additional frame is sent due to TX_ANNONCE.
Invoking a second tx_setup on the same item led to a reduced (by 1) number of
sent frames.
