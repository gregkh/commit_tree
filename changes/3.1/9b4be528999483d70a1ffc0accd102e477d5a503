[SCSI] isci: dynamic interrupt coalescing

Hardware allows both an outstanding number commands and a timeout value
(whichever occurs first) as a gate to the next interrupt generation.  This
scheme at completion time looks at the remaining number of outstanding tasks
and sets the timeout to maximize small transaction operation.  If transactions
are large (take more than a few 10s of microseconds to complete) then
performance is not interrupt processing bound, so the small timeouts this
scheme generates are overridden by the time it takes for a completion to
arrive.
