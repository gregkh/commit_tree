watchdog: Use "request_muxed_region" in it87 watchdog drivers

Changes the it87 watchdog drivers to use "request_muxed_region".
Serialize access to the hardware by using "request_muxed_region" macro defined
by Alan Cox. Call to this macro will hold off the requestor if the resource is
currently busy. 

The use of the above macro makes it possible to get rid of
spinlocks in it8712f_wdt.c and it87_wdt.c watchdog drivers.
This also greatly simplifies the implementation of it87_wdt.c driver.

 "superio_enter" will return an error if call to "request_muxed_region" fails. 
Rest of the code change is to ripple an error return from superio_enter to
the top level.
