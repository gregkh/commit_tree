[media] tea575x: convert to control framework

Convert tea575x-tuner to use the new V4L2 control framework. Also add
ext_init() callback that can be used by a card driver for additional
initialization right before registering the video device (for SF16-FMR2).

Also embed struct video_device to struct snd_tea575x to simplify the code.
