ath9k: skip ->config_pci_powersave() if PCIe port has ASPM disabled

We receive many bug reports about system hang during suspend/resume
when ath9k driver is in use. Adrian Chadd remarked that this problem
happens on systems that have ASPM disabled.

To do not hit the bug, skip doing ->config_pci_powersave magic if PCIe
downstream port device, which ath9k device is connected to, has ASPM
disabled.

Bug was introduced by:

commit 53bc7aa08b48e5cd745f986731cc7dc24eef2a9f

    ath9k: Add support for newer AR9285 chipsets.

Patch should address:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37462
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37082
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=697157

however I did not receive confirmation about that, except from Camilo
Mesias, whose system stops hang regularly with this patch (but still
hangs from time to time, but this is probably some other bug).
