Btrfs: use a worker thread to do caching

A user reported a deadlock when copying a bunch of files.  This is because they
were low on memory and kthreadd got hung up trying to migrate pages for an
allocation when starting the caching kthread.  The page was locked by the person
starting the caching kthread.  To fix this we just need to use the async thread
stuff so that the threads are already created and we don't have to worry about
deadlocks.  Thanks,
