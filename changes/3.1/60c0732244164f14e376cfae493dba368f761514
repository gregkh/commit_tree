[media] v4l2-ctrls.c: add support for V4L2_EVENT_SUB_FL_ALLOW_FEEDBACK

Normally no control events will go to the filehandle that called the
VIDIOC_S_CTRL/VIDIOC_S_EXT_CTRLS ioctls. This is to prevent a feedback
loop.

This can now be overridden by setting the new V4L2_EVENT_SUB_FL_ALLOW_FEEDBACK
flag.

Based on suggestions from Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com> and
Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>.
