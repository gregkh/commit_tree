MIPS: Malta: Fix crash in SMP kernel on non-CMP systems.

Since 6be63bbbdab66b9185dc6f67c8b1bacb6f37f946 (lmo) rsp.
af3a1f6f4813907e143f87030cde67a9971db533 (kernel.org) the Malta code does
no longer probe for presence of GCMP if CMP is not configured.  This means
that the variable gcmp_present well be left at its default value of -1
which normally is meant to indicate that GCMP has not yet been mmapped.
This non-zero value is now interpreted as GCMP being present resulting
in a write attempt to a GCMP register resulting in a crash.

Reported and a build fix on top of my fix by Rob Landley <rob@landley.net>.
