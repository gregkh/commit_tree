sched: Simplify mutex_spin_on_owner()

It does not make sense to rcu_read_lock/unlock() in every loop
iteration while spinning on the mutex.

Move the rcu protection outside the loop. Also simplify the
return path to always check for lock->owner == NULL which
meets the requirements of both owner changed and need_resched()
caused loop exits.
