tipc: Partition name table instance array info into two parts

Modifies the name table array structure that contains the name
sequence instances for a given name type so that the publication
lists associated with a given instance are stored in a dynamically
allocated structure, rather than being embedded within the array
entry itself. This change is being done for several reasons:

1) It reduces the amount of data that needs to be copied whenever
a given array is expanded or contracted to accommodate the first
publication of a new name sequence or the removal of the last
publication of an existing name sequence.

2) It reduces the amount of memory associated with array entries that
are currently unused.

3) It facilitates the upcoming conversion of the publication lists
from TIPC-specific circular lists to standard kernel lists. (Standard
lists cannot be used with the former array structure because the
relocation of array entries during array expansion and contraction
would corrupt the lists.)

Note that, aside from introducing a small amount of code to dynamically
allocate and free the structure that now holds publication list info,
this change is largely a simple renaming exercise that replaces
references to "sseq->LIST" with "sseq->info->LIST" (or "info->LIST").
