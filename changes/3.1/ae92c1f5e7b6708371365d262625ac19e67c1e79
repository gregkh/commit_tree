TTY: export NR_LDISC and N_* line discipline numbers to user-space

Since commit (4564f9e5: consolidate line discipline number definitions)
the patch moved all line discipline number from a per-architecture termios.h
to a shared one: tty.h. However, prior to this consolidation work, the
line discipline numbers were outside of an ifdef __KERNEL__/endif block
so these numbers used to be exported to user-space.

Since such numbers are kernel ABI anyway, and tty.h is already included
for user- space header processing, just move these relevant defines
outside of the ifdef __KERNEL__/endif block in include/linux/tty.h.
