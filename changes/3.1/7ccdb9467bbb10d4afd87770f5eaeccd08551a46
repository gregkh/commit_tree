watchdog: pc87413_wdt: Cleanup pc87413 watchdog driver to use

Inspired by Nat Gurumoorthy's recent patches for cleaning up the it87
drivers to use request_muxed_region for accessing the SuperIO area on
these chips, and the fact I have a GPIO driver for the pc8741x basically
ready for submission, here is a patch to cleanup the pc87413 watchdog
driver to use request_muxed_region for accessing the SuperIO area.

It also pulls out the details about the SWC IO area on initial driver
load, and properly does a request_region for that area - there's no
requirement to touch the SuperIO area after doing the initial watchdog
enable and IO base retrieval.

While I have hardware with a pc87413 on it it is not wired in a way that
allows the watchdog to reboot the machine, so I have not been able to
fully test these changes - I have checked that the driver correctly
initialises itself still and requests the SWC io region ok.
