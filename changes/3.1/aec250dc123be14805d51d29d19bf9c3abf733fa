ARM: mach-imx/mx27_3ds: Fix regulator support

Fix the 2.8V (VMMC1) and 1.8V (VGEN) voltage generation on mx27_3ds.

Also configure the IOMUX for the PMIC interrupt pin and for the CSPI chip select that is connected
to the MC13783 PMIC.

In order to get the voltage for the LCD (2.8V and 1.8V) it is also necessary to turn on GPO1 and GPO3
supplies because they are connected to switches that enable these two voltages.
