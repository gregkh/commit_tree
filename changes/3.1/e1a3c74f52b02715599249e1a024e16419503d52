ARM: S3C64XX: Initial support for Wolfson/Simtec Cragganmore/Banff

The Cragganmore carrier card and Banff CPU module are used on Wolfson
Microelectronics reference systems.  This initial support covers the
core system which is a fairly generic S3C6410 based design, further
patches will add support for the key features of the reference system.

The initial board bringup and therefore much of the key code was done by
Ben Dooks for Simtec, with additional work (especially around the
integration of the Wolfson devices) being done by myself.
