mm: vmscan: fix force-scanning small targets without swap

Without swap, anonymous pages are not scanned.  As such, they should not
count when considering force-scanning a small target if there is no swap.

Otherwise, targets are not force-scanned even when their effective scan
number is zero and the other conditions--kswapd/memcg--apply.

This fixes 246e87a93934 ("memcg: fix get_scan_count() for small
targets").
