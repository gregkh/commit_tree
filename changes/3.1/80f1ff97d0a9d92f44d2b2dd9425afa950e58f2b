notifiers: cpu: move cpu notifiers into cpu.h

We presently define all kinds of notifiers in notifier.h.  This is not
necessary at all, since different subsystems use different notifiers, they
are almost non-related with each other.

This can also save much build time.  Suppose I add a new netdevice event,
really I don't have to recompile all the source, just network related.
Without this patch, all the source will be recompiled.

I move the notify events near to their subsystem notifier registers, so
that they can be found more easily.

This patch:

It is not necessary to share the same notifier.h.
