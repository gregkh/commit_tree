md/raid5: Avoid BUG caused by multiple failures.

While preparing to write a stripe we keep the parity block or blocks
locked (R5_LOCKED) - towards the end of schedule_reconstruction.

If the array is discovered to have failed before this write completes
we can leave those blocks LOCKED, and init_stripe will notice that a
free stripe still has a locked block and will complain.

So clear the R5_LOCKED flag in handle_failed_stripe, and demote the
'BUG' to a 'WARN_ON'.
