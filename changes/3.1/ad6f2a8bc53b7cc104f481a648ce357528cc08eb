usb: renesas_usbhs: modify pipe direction flags

Current driver had pipe direction flag
which came from usb_endpoint_dir_in().
It means "input direction" for HOST,
and "out direction" for Gadget.
But driver needs "input direction for pipe".
This patch adds IS_DIR_HOST flags and care
both "input direction for HOST" and "input direction for pipe"
