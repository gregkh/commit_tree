KVM: PPC: e500: Save/restore SPE state

This is done lazily.  The SPE save will be done only if the guest has
used SPE since the last preemption or heavyweight exit.  Restore will be
done only on demand, when enabling MSR_SPE in the shadow MSR, in response
to an SPE fault or mtmsr emulation.

For SPEFSCR, Linux already switches it on context switch (non-lazily), so
the only remaining bit is to save it between qemu and the guest.
