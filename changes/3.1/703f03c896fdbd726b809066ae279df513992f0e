geode: reflect mfgpt dependency on mfd

As stated in drivers/mfd/cs5535-mfd.c, the mfd driver exposes the BARs
which then make the GPIO, MFGPT, ACPI, etc.  all visible to the system.

So the dependencies of the MFGPT stuff have changed, and most people
expect Kconfig to bring in the necessary dependencies.  Without them, the
module fails to load and most people don't understand why because the
details of the rewrite aren't captured anywhere most people who know to
look.

This dependency needs to be reflected in Kconfig.
