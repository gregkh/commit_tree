drm/radeon/kms: Make GPU/CPU page size handling consistent in blit code (v2)

The BO blit code inconsistenly handled the page size.  This wasn't
an issue on system with 4k pages since the GPU's page size is 4k as
well.  Switch the driver blit callbacks to take num pages in GPU
page units.

Fixes lemote mipsel systems using AMD rs780/rs880 chipsets.

v2: incorporate suggestions from Michel.
