xen/pciback: Drop two backends, squash and cleanup some code.

 - Remove the slot and controller controller backend as they
   are not used.
 - Document the find pciback_[read|write]_config_[byte|word|dword]
   to make it easier to find.
 - Collapse the code from conf_space_capability_msi into pciback_ops.c
 - Collapse conf_space_capability_[pm|vpd].c in conf_space_capability.c
   [and remove the conf_space_capability.h file]
 - Rename all visible functions from pciback to xen_pcibk.
 - Rename all the printk/pr_info, etc that use the "pciback" to say
   "xen-pciback".
 - Convert functions that are not referenced outside the code to be
   static to save on name space.
 - Do the same thing for structures that are internal to the driver.
 - Run checkpatch.pl after the renames and fixup its warnings and
   fix any compile errors caused by the variable rename
 - Cleanup any structs that checkpath.pl commented about or just
   look odd.
