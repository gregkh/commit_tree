md/raid5: Remove use of sh->lock in sync_request

This is the start of a series of patches to remove sh->lock.

sync_request takes sh->lock before setting STRIPE_SYNCING to ensure
there is no race with testing it in handle_stripe[56].

Instead, use a new flag STRIPE_SYNC_REQUESTED and test it early
in handle_stripe[56] (after getting the same lock) and perform the
same set/clear operations if it was set.
