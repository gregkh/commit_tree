OMAP: hwmod: Wait the idle status to be disabled

It is mandatory to wait for a module to be in disabled state before
potentially disabling source clock or re-asserting a reset.

omap_hwmod_idle and omap_hwmod_shutdown does not wait for
the module to be fully idle.

Add a cm_xxx accessor to wait the clkctrl idle status to be disabled.
Fix hwmod_[idle|shutdown] to use this API.

Based on Rajendra's initial patch.

Please note that most interconnects hwmod will return one timeout because
it is impossible for them to be in idle since the processor is accessing
the registers though the interconnect.
