x86, mce: Use mce_sysdev_ prefix to group functions

There are many functions named mce_* so use a new prefix for the subset
of functions related to sysfs support.

And since f3c6ea1b06c71b43f751b36bd99345369fe911af introduces
syscore_ops, use the prefix mce_syscore for some functions related to
power management which were in sysdev_class before.

  Before:			After:
   mce_device   		 mce_sysdev
   mce_sysclass 		 mce_sysdev_class
   mce_attrs    		 mce_sysdev_attrs
   mce_dev_initialized  	 mce_sysdev_initialized
   mce_create_device    	 mce_sysdev_create
   mce_remove_device    	 mce_sysdev_remove

   mce_suspend  		 mce_syscore_suspend
   mce_shutdown 		 mce_syscore_shutdown
   mce_resume   		 mce_syscore_resume
