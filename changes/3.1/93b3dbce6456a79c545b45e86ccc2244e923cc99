md/raid5: unite fetch_block5 and fetch_block6

Provided that ->failed_num[1] is not a valid device number (which is
easily achieved) fetch_block6 provides all the functionality of
fetch_block5.

So remove the latter and rename the former to simply "fetch_block".

Then handle_stripe_fill5 and handle_stripe_fill6 become the same and
can similarly be united.
