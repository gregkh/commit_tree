powerpc, KVM: Rework KVM checks in first-level interrupt handlers

Instead of branching out-of-line with the DO_KVM macro to check if we
are in a KVM guest at the time of an interrupt, this moves the KVM
check inline in the first-level interrupt handlers.  This speeds up
the non-KVM case and makes sure that none of the interrupt handlers
are missing the check.

Because the first-level interrupt handlers are now larger, some things
had to be move out of line in exceptions-64s.S.

This all necessitated some minor changes to the interrupt entry code
in KVM.  This also streamlines the book3s_32 KVM test.
