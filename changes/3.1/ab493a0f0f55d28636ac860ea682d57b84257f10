drivers: iommu: move to a dedicated folder

Create a dedicated folder for iommu drivers, and move the base
iommu implementation over there.

Grouping the various iommu drivers in a single location will help
finding similar problems shared by different platforms, so they
could be solved once, in the iommu framework, instead of solved
differently (or duplicated) in each driver.
