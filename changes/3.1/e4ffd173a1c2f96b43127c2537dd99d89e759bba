drm/i915: Add an interface to dynamically change the cache level

[anholt v2: Don't forget that when going from cached to uncached, we
haven't been tracking the write domain from the CPU perspective, since

[ickle v3: We also need to make sure we relinquish any fences on older
chipsets and clear the GTT for sane domain tracking.]
