xfs: return the buffer locked from xfs_buf_get_uncached

All other xfs_buf_get/read-like helpers return the buffer locked, make sure
xfs_buf_get_uncached isn't different for no reason.  Half of the callers
already lock it directly after, and the others probably should also keep
it locked if only for consistency and beeing able to use xfs_buf_rele,
but I'll leave that for later.
