[CPUFREQ] S3C6410: Add some lower frequencies for 800MHz base clock operation

By extension from the 667MHz based clocks currently supported add 100MHz
and 200MHz operating points. Due to a lack of documentation these have not
been confirmed as supported but by extension from the existing frequencies
they should be OK, and I've given them quite a bit of runtime testing.

The major risk is synchronization with the non-ARM clocks but as we
can't currently scale the ARM PLL the risk should be relatively low.
