mm: Cleanup clearing of BDI_pending bit in bdi_forker_thread()

bdi_forker_thread() clears BDI_pending bit at the end of the main loop.
However clearing of this bit must not be done in some cases which is
handled by calling 'continue' from switch statement. That's kind of
unusual construct and without a good reason so change the function into
more intuitive code flow.
