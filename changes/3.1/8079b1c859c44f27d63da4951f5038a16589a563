mm: clarify the radix_tree exceptional cases

Make the radix_tree exceptional cases, mostly in filemap.c, clearer.

It's hard to devise a suitable snappy name that illuminates the use by
shmem/tmpfs for swap, while keeping filemap/pagecache/radix_tree
generality.  And akpm points out that /* radix_tree_deref_retry(page) */
comments look like calls that have been commented out for unknown
reason.

Skirt the naming difficulty by rearranging these blocks to handle the
transient radix_tree_deref_retry(page) case first; then just explain the
remaining shmem/tmpfs swap case in a comment.
