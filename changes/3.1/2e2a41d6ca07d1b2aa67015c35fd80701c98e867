    iwlagn: fix command queue timeout

    If the command queue is constantly busy,
    which can happen in P2P, the hangcheck
    timer will frequently find a command in
    it and will eventually reset the device
    because nothing sets the timestamp for
    this queue when commands are processed.

    Fix this by setting the timestamp when
    a command completes.

iwlegacy does not support P2P, but this patch fix possible
unneeded hardware resets, hence is needed.
