KVM: KVM Steal time guest/host interface

To implement steal time, we need the hypervisor to pass the guest information
about how much time was spent running other processes outside the VM.
This is per-vcpu, and using the kvmclock structure for that is an abuse
we decided not to make.

In this patchset, I am introducing a new msr, KVM_MSR_STEAL_TIME, that
holds the memory area address containing information about steal time

This patch contains the headers for it. I am keeping it separate to facilitate
backports to people who wants to backport the kernel part but not the
hypervisor, or the other way around.
