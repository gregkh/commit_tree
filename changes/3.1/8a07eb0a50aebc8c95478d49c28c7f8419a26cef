sctp: Add ASCONF operation on the single-homed host

In this case, the SCTP association transmits an ASCONF packet
including addition of the new IP address and deletion of the old
address.  This patch implements this functionality.
In this case, the ASCONF chunk is added to the beginning of the
queue, because the other chunks cannot be transmitted in this state.
