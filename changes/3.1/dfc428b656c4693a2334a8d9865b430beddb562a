taskstats: add_del_listener() shouldn't use the wrong node

1. Commit 26c4caea9d69 "don't allow duplicate entries in listener mode"
   changed add_del_listener(REGISTER) so that "next_cpu:" can reuse the
   listener allocated for the previous cpu, this doesn't look exactly
   right even if minor.

   Change the code to kfree() in the already-registered case, this case
   is unlikely anyway so the extra kmalloc_node() shouldn't hurt but
   looke more correct and clean.

2. use the plain list_for_each_entry() instead of _safe() to scan
   listeners->list.

3. Remove the unneeded INIT_LIST_HEAD(&s->list), we are going to
   list_add(&s->list).
