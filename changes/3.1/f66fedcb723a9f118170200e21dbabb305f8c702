perf probe: Fix regression of variable finder

Fix to call convert_variable() if previous call does not fail.

To call convert_variable, it ensures "ret" is 0. However, since
"ret" has the return value of synthesize_perf_probe_arg() which
always returns positive value if it succeeded, perf probe doesn't
call convert_variable(). This will cause a SEGV when we add an
event with arguments.

This has to be fixed as it ensures "ret" is greater than 0
(or not negative).

This regression has been introduced by my previous patch, f182e3e1.
