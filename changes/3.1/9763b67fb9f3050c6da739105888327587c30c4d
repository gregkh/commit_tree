sched, cgroup: Optimize load_balance_fair()

Use for_each_leaf_cfs_rq() instead of list_for_each_entry_rcu(), this
achieves that load_balance_fair() only iterates those task_groups that
actually have tasks on busiest, and that we iterate bottom-up, trying to
move light groups before the heavier ones.

No idea if it will actually work out to be beneficial in practice, does
anybody have a cgroup workload that might show a difference one way or
the other?

[ Also move update_h_load to sched_fair.c, loosing #ifdef-ery ]
