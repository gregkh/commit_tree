ALSA: hdspm - Provide MADI speed mode selector on RME MADI and MADIface

When running in slave mode (no clock master), there is no way to
determine the real wirespeed on the MADI link (single/double/quad
speed). Like physical gear, simply provide the user with a tristate
switch to select the appropriate format.
