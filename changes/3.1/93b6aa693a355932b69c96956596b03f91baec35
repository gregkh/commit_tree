nl80211/cfg80211: add max_sched_scan_ssids in the hw description

Some chips can scan more SSIDs with a single scheduled scan command
than with a single normal scan command (eg. wl12xx chips).

To support this, this patch creates a separate hardware description
element that describes the amount of SSIDs supported in scheduled
scans.
