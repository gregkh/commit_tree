lis3: fix regression of HP DriveGuard with 8bit chip

Commit 2a7fade7e03 ("hwmon: lis3: Power on corrections") caused a
regression on HP laptops with 8bit chip.  Writing CTRL2_BOOT_8B bit seems
clearing the BIOS setup, and no proper interrupt for DriveGuard will be
triggered any more.

Since the init code there is basically only for embedded devices, put a
pdata check so that the problematic initialization will be skipped for
hp_accel stuff.
