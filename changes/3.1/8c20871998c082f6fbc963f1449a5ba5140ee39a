ext4: Properly count journal credits for long symlinks

Commit df5e6223407e ("ext4: fix deadlock in ext4_symlink() in ENOSPC
conditions") recalculated the number of credits needed for a long
symlink, in the process of splitting it into two transactions.  However,
the first credit calculation under-counted because if selinux is
enabled, credits are needed to create the selinux xattr as well.

Overrunning the reservation will result in an OOPS in
jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() due to this assert:

  J_ASSERT_JH(jh, handle->h_buffer_credits > 0);

Fix this by increasing the reservation size.
