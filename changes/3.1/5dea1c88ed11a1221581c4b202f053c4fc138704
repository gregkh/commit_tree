lguest: use a special 1:1 linear pagetable mode until first switch.

The Host used to create some page tables for the Guest to use at the
top of Guest memory; it would then tell the Guest where this was.  In
particular, it created linear mappings for 0 and 0xC0000000 addresses
because lguest used to switch to its real page tables quite late in
boot.

However, since d50d8fe19 Linux initialized boot page tables in
head_32.S even before the "are we lguest?" boot jump.  So, now we can
simplify things: the Host pagetable code assumes 1:1 linear mapping
until it first calls the LHCALL_NEW_PGTABLE hypercall, which we now do
before we reach C code.

This also means that the Host doesn't need to know anything about the
Guest's PAGE_OFFSET.  (Non-Linux guests might not even have such a
thing).
