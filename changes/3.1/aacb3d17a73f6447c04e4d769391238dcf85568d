fs/exec.c: use BUILD_BUG_ON for VM_STACK_FLAGS & VM_STACK_INCOMPLETE_SETUP

Commit a8bef8ff6ea1 ("mm: migration: avoid race between
shift_arg_pages() and rmap_walk() during migration by not migrating
temporary stacks") introduced a BUG_ON() to ensure that VM_STACK_FLAGS
and VM_STACK_INCOMPLETE_SETUP do not overlap.  The check is a compile
time one, so BUILD_BUG_ON is more appropriate.
