ALSA: ctxfi: Add support for Creative Titanium HD

Initialise model-specific DAC and ADC parts.
Add controls for output and mic source selection.
Rename some mixer controls according to ControlNames.txt.
Remove Playback switches for Line-in and IEC958-in - these
were controlling the input mute/unmute which affected
capture too.  Use the capture switches to control the
input mute/unmute instead - it's less confusing.
Initialise the WM8775 to invert the left-right clock
to swap the left and right channels of the mic and aux
input.
