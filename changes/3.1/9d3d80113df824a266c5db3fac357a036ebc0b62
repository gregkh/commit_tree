md/raid1: move rdev->corrected_errors counting

Read errors are considered to corrected if write-back and re-read
cycle is finished without further problems. Thus moving the rdev->
corrected_errors counting after the re-reading looks more reasonable
IMHO. Also included a couple of whitespace fixes on sync_page_io().
