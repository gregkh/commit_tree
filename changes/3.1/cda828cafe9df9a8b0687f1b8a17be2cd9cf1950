ASoC: sh: fsi: cleanup suspend/resume

Current FSI driver was using saved_xxx variable for suspend/resume.
OTOH, the start and stop of power/clock are controlled by
fsi_hw_startup/fsi_hw_shutdown in current FSI driver.
The all necessary registers value are set by fsi_hw_startup.

So, if fsi_hw_shutdown is called when "suspend" is generated,
and fsi_hw_startup is called at "resume",
the saved_xxx are not needed.
