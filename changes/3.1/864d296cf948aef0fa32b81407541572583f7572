PCI: ARI is a PCIe v2 feature

The function pci_enable_ari() may mistakenly set the downstream port
of a v1 PCIe switch in ARI Forwarding mode.  This is a PCIe v2 feature,
and with an SR-IOV device on that switch port believing the switch above
is ARI capable it may attempt to use functions 8-255, translating into
invalid (non-zero) device numbers for that bus.  This has been seen
to cause Completion Timeouts and general misbehaviour including hangs
and panics.
