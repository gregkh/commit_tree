docproc: cleanup brace placement

The placement of the opening brace "{" after 'if' statements in
scripts/docproc.c is inconsistent. Most are placed on the same line as the 'if'
statement itself as per CodingStyle, but a few are not.  This patch cleans up
the inconsistency. We save a few source lines and the file then uses the same
style throughout, which is nice.
