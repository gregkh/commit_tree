driver core: Add ability for arch code to setup pdev_archdata

On some architectures we need to setup pdev_archdata before we add the
device.  Waiting til a bus_notifier is too late since we might need the
pdev_archdata in the bus notifier.  One example is setting up of dma_mask
pointers such that it can be used in a bus_notifier.

We add weak noop version of arch_setup_pdev_archdata() and allow the arch
code to override with access the full definitions of struct device,
struct platform_device, and struct pdev_archdata.
