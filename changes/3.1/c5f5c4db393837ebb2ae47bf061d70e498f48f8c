staging: zcache: fix crash on high memory swap

zcache_put_page() was modified to pass page_address(page) instead of the
actual page structure. In combination with the function signature changes
to tmem_put() and zcache_pampd_create(), zcache_pampd_create() tries to
(re)derive the page structure from the virtual address.  However, if the
original page is a high memory page (or any unmapped page), this
virt_to_page() fails because the page_address() in zcache_put_page()
returned NULL.

This patch changes zcache_put_page() and zcache_get_page() to pass
the page structure instead of the page's virtual address, which
may or may not exist.
