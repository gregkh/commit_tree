ipc/sem.c: fix race with concurrent semtimedop() timeouts and IPC_RMID

If a semaphore array is removed and in parallel a sleeping task is woken
up (signal or timeout, does not matter), then the woken up task does not
wait until wake_up_sem_queue_do() is completed.  This will cause crashes,
because wake_up_sem_queue_do() will read from a stale pointer.

The fix is simple: Regardless of anything, always call get_queue_result().
This function waits until wake_up_sem_queue_do() has finished it's task.
