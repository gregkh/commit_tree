block: Make rq_affinity = 1 work as expected

Commit 5757a6d76c introduced a new rq_affinity = 2 so as to make
the request completed in the __make_request cpu. But it makes the
old rq_affinity = 1 not work any more. The root cause is that
if the 'cpu' and 'req->cpu' is in the same group and cpu != req->cpu,
ccpu will be the same as group_cpu, so the completion will be
excuted in the 'cpu' not 'group_cpu'.

This patch fix problem by simpling removing group_cpu and the codes
are more explicit now. If ccpu == cpu, we complete in cpu, otherwise
we raise_blk_irq to ccpu.
