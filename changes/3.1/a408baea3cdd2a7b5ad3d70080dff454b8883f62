ARM: mach-shmobile: sh7372 CMT3 and CMT4 clock support

Add clock control support for sh7372 CMT hardware blocks.

No upstream sh7372 boards are making use of CMT3 + CMT4,
but the sh7372 hardware happens to come out of reset with
all CMT MSTP clocks _enabled_, so to save power we need
to implement a fix in software to shut down unused clocks.

This patch relies on the recently merged

 794d78f drivers: sh: late disabling of clocks V2

to make sure the unused clocks get disabled as expected.
