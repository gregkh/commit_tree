net_sched: fix dequeuer fairness

Results on dummy device can be seen in my netconf 2011
slides. These results are for a 10Gige IXGBE intel
nic - on another i5 machine, very similar specs to
the one used in the netconf2011 results.
It turns out - this is a hell lot worse than dummy
and so this patch is even more beneficial for 10G.

Test setup:
----------

System under test sending packets out.
Additional box connected directly dropping packets.
Installed prio qdisc on the eth device and default
netdev default length of 1000 used as is.
The 3 prio bands each were set to 100 (didnt factor in
the results).

5 packet runs were made and the middle 3 picked.

results
-------

The "cpu" column indicates the which cpu the sample
was taken on,
The "Pkt runx" carries the number of packets a cpu
dequeued when forced to be in the "dequeuer" role.
The "avg" for each run is the number of times each
cpu should be a "dequeuer" if the system was fair.

As you can see the system is still not perfect but
is a lot better than what it was before...

At the moment we use the old backlog weight, weight_p
which is 64 packets. It seems to be reasonably fine
with that value.
The system could be made more fair if we reduce the
weight_p (as per my presentation), but we are going
to affect the shared backlog weight. Unless deemed
necessary, I think the default value is fine. If not
we could add yet another knob.
