x86, mce: Use mce_chrdev_ prefix to group functions

There are many functions named mce_* so use a new prefix for the subset
of functions dealing with the character device /dev/mcelog.

This change doesn't impact the mce-inject module because the exported
symbol mce_chrdev_ops already has the prefix, therefore it is left
unchanged.

  Before:			After:
   mce_wait			 mce_chrdev_wait
   mce_state_lock		 mce_chrdev_state_lock
   open_count   		 mce_chrdev_open_count
   open_exclu   		 mce_chrdev_open_exclu
   mce_open			 mce_chrdev_open
   mce_release  		 mce_chrdev_release
   mce_read_mutex		 mce_chrdev_read_mutex
   mce_read			 mce_chrdev_read
   mce_poll			 mce_chrdev_poll
   mce_ioctl    		 mce_chrdev_ioctl
   mce_log_device		 mce_chrdev_device
