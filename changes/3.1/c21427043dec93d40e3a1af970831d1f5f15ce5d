oom_ajd: don't use WARN_ONCE, just use printk_once

WARN_ONCE() is very annoying, in that it shows the stack trace that we
don't care about at all, and also triggers various user-level "kernel
oopsed" logic that we really don't care about.  And it's not like the
user can do anything about the applications (sshd) in question, it's a
distro issue.
