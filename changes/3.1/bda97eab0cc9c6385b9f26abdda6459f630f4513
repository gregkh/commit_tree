tmpfs: copy truncate_inode_pages_range

Bring truncate.c's code for truncate_inode_pages_range() inline into
shmem_truncate_range(), replacing its first call (there's a followup
call below, but leave that one, it will disappear next).

Don't play with it yet, apart from leaving out the cleancache flush, and
(importantly) the nrpages == 0 skip, and moving shmem_setattr()'s
partial page preparation into its partial page handling.
