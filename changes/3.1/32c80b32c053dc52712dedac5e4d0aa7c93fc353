ext4: Resolve the hang of direct i/o read in handling EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN.

EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag set and the increase of i_aiodio_unwritten
should be done simultaneously since ext4_end_io_nolock always clear
the flag and decrease the counter in the same time.

We don't increase i_aiodio_unwritten when setting
EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN so it will go nagative and causes some process
to wait forever.

Part of the patch came from Eric in his e-mail, but it doesn't fix the
problem met by Michael actually.
