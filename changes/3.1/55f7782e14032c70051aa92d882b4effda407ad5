zd1211rw: detect stalled beacon interrupt faster

As USB_INT_ID_RETRY_FAILED can override USB_INT_ID_REGS, beacon interrupt
(CR_INTERRUPT) might be lost. Problem is that when device trigger CR_INTERRUPT
it disables HW interrupt. Now if USB_INT_ID_REGS with CR_INTERRUPT gets lost,
beacon interrupt stays disabled until beacon watchdog notices the stall. This
happen very often on heavy TX. Improve watchdog to trigger earlier, after three
missing beacon interrupts.
