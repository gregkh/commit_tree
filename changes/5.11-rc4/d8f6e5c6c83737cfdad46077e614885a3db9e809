scripts: coccicheck: Correct usage of make coccicheck

The command "make coccicheck C=1 CHECK=scripts/coccicheck" results in the
error:
        ./scripts/coccicheck: line 65: -1: shift count out of range

This happens because every time the C variable is specified,
the shell arguments need to be "shifted" in order to take only
the last argument, which is the C file to test. These shell arguments
mostly comprise flags that have been set in the Makefile. However,
when coccicheck is specified in the make command as a rule, the
number of shell arguments is zero, thus passing the invalid value -1
to the shift command, resulting in an error.

Modify coccicheck to print correct usage of make coccicheck so as to
avoid the error.
