net: sit: unregister_netdevice on newlink's error path

We need to unregister the netdevice if config failed.
.ndo_uninit takes care of most of the heavy lifting.

This was uncovered by recent commit c269a24ce057 ("net: make
free_netdev() more lenient with unregistering devices").
Previously the partially-initialized device would be left
in the system.
