dm: eliminate potential source of excessive kernel log noise

There wasn't ever a real need to log an error in the kernel log for
ioctls issued with insufficient permissions. Simply return an error
and if an admin/user is sufficiently motivated they can enable DM's
dynamic debugging to see an explanation for why the ioctls were
disallowed.
