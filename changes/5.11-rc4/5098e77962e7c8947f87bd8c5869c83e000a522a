USB: serial: digi_acceleport: fix write-wakeup deadlocks

The driver must not call tty_wakeup() while holding its private lock as
line disciplines are allowed to call back into write() from
write_wakeup(), leading to a deadlock.

Also remove the unneeded work struct that was used to defer wakeup in
order to work around a possible race in ancient times (see comment about
n_tty write_chan() in commit 14b54e39b412 ("USB: serial: remove
changelogs and old todo entries")).
