selftests/bpf: Add checking of raw type dump in BTF writer APIs selftests

Add re-usable btf_helpers.{c,h} to provide BTF-related testing routines. Start
with adding a raw BTF dumping helpers.

Raw BTF dump is the most succinct and at the same time a very human-friendly
way to validate exact contents of BTF types. Cross-validate raw BTF dump and
writable BTF in a single selftest. Raw type dump checks also serve as a good
self-documentation.
