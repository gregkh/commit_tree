mac80211: Fix calculation of minimal channel width

When calculating the minimal channel width for channel context,
the current operation Rx channel width of a station was used and not
the overall channel width capability of the station, i.e., both for
Tx and Rx.

Fix ieee80211_get_sta_bw() to use the maximal channel width the
station is capable. While at it make the function static.
