dm crypt: do not call bio_endio() from the dm-crypt tasklet

Sometimes, when dm-crypt executes decryption in a tasklet, we may get
"BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in tasklet_action_common.constprop..."
with a kasan-enabled kernel.

When the decryption fully completes in the tasklet, dm-crypt will call
bio_endio(), which in turn will call clone_endio() from dm.c core code. That
function frees the resources associated with the bio, including per bio private
structures. For dm-crypt it will free the current struct dm_crypt_io, which
contains our tasklet object, causing use-after-free, when the tasklet is being
dequeued by the kernel.

To avoid this, do not call bio_endio() from the current tasklet context, but
delay its execution to the dm-crypt IO workqueue.
