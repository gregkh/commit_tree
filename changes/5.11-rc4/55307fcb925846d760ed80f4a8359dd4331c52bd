octeontx2-af: Add mbox messages to install and delete MCAM rules

Added new mailbox messages to install and delete MCAM rules.
These mailbox messages will be used for adding/deleting ethtool
n-tuple filters by NIX PF. The installed MCAM rules are stored
in a list that will be traversed later to delete the MCAM entries
when the interface is brought down or when PCIe FLR is received.
The delete mailbox supports deleting a single MCAM entry or range
of entries or all the MCAM entries owned by the pcifunc. Each MCAM
entry can be associated with a HW match stat entry if the mailbox
requester wants to check the hit count for debugging.

Modified adding default unicast DMAC match rule using install
flow API. The default unicast DMAC match entry installed by
Administrative Function is saved and can be changed later by the
mailbox user to fit additional fields, or the default MCAM entry
rule action can be used for other flow rules installed later.

Modified rvu_mbox_handler_nix_lf_free mailbox to add a flag to
disable or delete the MCAM entries. The MCAM entries are disabled
when the interface is brought down and deleted in FLR handler.
The disabled MCAM entries will be re-enabled when the interface
is brought up again.
