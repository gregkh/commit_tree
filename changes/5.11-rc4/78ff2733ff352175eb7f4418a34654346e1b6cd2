x86/kprobes: Restore BTF if the single-stepping is cancelled

Fix to restore BTF if single-stepping causes a page fault and
it is cancelled.

Usually the BTF flag was restored when the single stepping is done
(in resume_execution()). However, if a page fault happens on the
single stepping instruction, the fault handler is invoked and
the single stepping is cancelled. Thus, the BTF flag is not
restored.
