habanalabs: Rename hw_queues_mirror to cs_mirror

Future command submission types might be submitted to HW not via the
QMAN queues path. However, it would be still required to have the TDR
mechanism for these CS, and thus the patch renames the TDR fields and
replaces the hw_queues_ prefix with cs_.
