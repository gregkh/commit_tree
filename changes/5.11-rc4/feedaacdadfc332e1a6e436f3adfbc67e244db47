Input: atmel_mxt_ts - fix up inverted RESET handler

This driver uses GPIO descriptors to drive the touchscreen RESET line. In
the existing device trees this has in conflict with intution been flagged
as GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and the driver then applies the reverse action by
driving the line low (setting to 0) to enter reset state and driving the
line high (setting to 1) to get out of reset state.

The correct way to handle active low GPIO lines is to provide the
GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW in the device tree (thus properly describing the hardware)
and letting the GPIO framework invert the assertion (driving high) to a
low level and vice versa.

This is considered a bug since the device trees are incorrectly
mis-specifying the line as active high.

Fix the driver and all device trees specifying a reset line.
