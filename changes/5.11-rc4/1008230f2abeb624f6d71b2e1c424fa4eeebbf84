HID: mf: add support for 0079:1846 Mayflash/Dragonrise USB Gamecube Adapter

Mayflash/Dragonrise seems to have yet another device ID for one of their
Gamecube controller adapters.  Previous to this commit, the adapter
registered only one /dev/input/js* device, and all controller inputs (from
any controller) were mapped to this device.  This patch defines the 1846
USB device ID and enables the HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT quirk for it, which
fixes that (with the patch, four /dev/input/js* devices are created, one
for each of the four controller ports).
