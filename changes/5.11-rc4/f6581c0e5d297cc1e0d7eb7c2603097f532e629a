ALSA: usb-audio: Track implicit fb sync endpoint in audioformat list

Instead of parsing and evaluating the sync endpoint and the implicit
feedback mode at each time the audio stream is opened, let's parse it
once at the probe time, as the all needed information can be obtained
statically from the descriptor or from the quirk.

This patch extends audioformat struct to record the sync endpoint,
interface and altsetting as well as the implicit feedback flag, which
are filled at parsing the streams.  Then, set_sync_endpoint() is much
simplified just to follow the already parsed data.
