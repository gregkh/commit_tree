drm: Compile out legacy chunks from struct drm_device

This means some very few #ifdef in code, but it allows us to
enlist the compiler to make sure this stuff isn't used anymore.

More important, only legacy drivers change drm_device (for the
legacy_dev_list shadow attach management), therefore this is
prep to allow modern drivers to have a const driver struct. Which
is nice, because there's a ton of function pointers in there.
