clk: remove unneeded dead-store initialization

make clang-analyzer on x86_64 defconfig caught my attention with:

  drivers/clk/clk.c:423:19:
  warning: Value stored to 'parent' during its initialization is never read
  [clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores]
          struct clk_core *parent = ERR_PTR(-ENOENT);
                           ^

Commit fc0c209c147f ("clk: Allow parents to be specified without string
names") introduced clk_core_fill_parent_index() with this unneeded
dead-store initialization.

So, simply remove this unneeded dead-store initialization to make
clang-analyzer happy.

As compilers will detect this unneeded assignment and optimize this anyway,
the resulting object code is identical before and after this change.

No functional change. No change to object code.
