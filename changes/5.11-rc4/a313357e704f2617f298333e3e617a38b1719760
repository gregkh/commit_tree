genirq: Move irq_has_action() into core code

This function uses irq_to_desc() and is going to be used by modules to
replace the open coded irq_to_desc() (ab)usage. The final goal is to remove
the export of irq_to_desc() so driver cannot fiddle with it anymore.

Move it into the core code and fixup the usage sites to include the proper
header.
