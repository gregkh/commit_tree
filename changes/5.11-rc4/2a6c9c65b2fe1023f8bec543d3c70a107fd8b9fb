watchdog: sprd: change to use usleep_range() instead of busy loop

After changing to check busy bit for the previous loading operation instead
of the current one, for most of cases, the busy bit is not set for the
first time of read, so there's no need to check so frequently, so this
patch use usleep_range() to replace cpu_relax() to avoid busy loop.

Also this patch change the max times to 11 which would be enough, since
according to the specification, the busy bit would be set after a new
loading operation and last 2 or 3 RTC clock cycles (about 60us~92us).
