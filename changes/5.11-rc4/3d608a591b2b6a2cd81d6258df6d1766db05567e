tty: Remove redundant synclinkmp driver

A note from the vendor:

 "The hardware used with synclink.c and synclinkmp.c has not been
  manufactured for 15 years and was low volume. The chances of either
  driver still being in use is very low. Not even Microgate (me) has
  the ability to test either anymore (no hardware). I donâ€™t know the
  policy about driver removal, but I think both could be removed
  without upsetting anyone."
