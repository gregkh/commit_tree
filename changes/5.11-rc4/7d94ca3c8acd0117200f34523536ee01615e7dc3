ASoC: mt8192: revert "add audio afe document"

This reverts commit 1afc60e00de3abbb6c559da409c5c1bb8c1d98ec
(dt-bindings: mediatek: mt8192: add audio afe document).

 https://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2020-November/176873.html
 These dependency are continuing to upstream, I will revert this patch first.
 After the dependencies are merged, I will send 'mt8192-afe-pcm.yaml' again.

[Massaged commit message to put hint about issue being fixed into there
rather than the trailer -- broonie]
