tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Account for missing sysfs for die_id

Some older kernels will not have support to get CPU die_id from the
sysfs. This requires several back ports. But the tool depends on getting
die_id to match to correct CPU.

Relax this restriction and use die_id as 0 when die_id is missing. This
is not a problem as we don't have any multi-die processors with Intel SST
support.

This helps in running this tool on older kernels with just Intel SST
drivers back ported.
