btrfs: prevent NULL pointer dereference in extent_io_tree_panic

Some extent io trees are initialized with NULL private member (e.g.
btrfs_device::alloc_state and btrfs_fs_info::excluded_extents).
Dereference of a NULL tree->private as inode pointer will cause panic.

Pass tree->fs_info as it's known to be valid in all cases.
