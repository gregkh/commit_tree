powerpc/8xx: Fix early debug when SMC1 is relocated

When SMC1 is relocated and early debug is selected, the
board hangs is ppc_md.setup_arch(). This is because ones
the microcode has been loaded and SMC1 relocated, early
debug writes in the weed.

To allow smooth continuation, the SMC1 parameter RAM set up
by the bootloader have to be copied into the new location.
