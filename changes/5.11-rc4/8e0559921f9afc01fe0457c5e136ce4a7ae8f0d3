bus: mhi: core: Skip device wake in error or shutdown states

MHI client drivers can request a device wake even if the device
may be in an error state or undergoing a shutdown. To prevent
unnecessary device wake processing, check for the device state
and bail out early so that the clients are made aware of the
device state sooner.
