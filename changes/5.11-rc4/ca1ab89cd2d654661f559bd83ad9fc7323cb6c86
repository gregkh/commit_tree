r8169: improve rtl_tx

We can simplify the for() condition and eliminate variable tx_left.
The change also considers that tp->cur_tx may be incremented by a
racing rtl8169_start_xmit().
In addition replace the write to tp->dirty_tx and the following
smp_mb() with an equivalent call to smp_store_mb(). This implicitly
adds a WRITE_ONCE() to the write.
