libbpf: Fail early when loading programs with unspecified type

Before this patch, a program with unspecified type
(BPF_PROG_TYPE_UNSPEC) would be passed to the BPF syscall, only to have
the kernel reject it with an opaque invalid argument error. This patch
makes libbpf reject such programs with a nicer error message - in
particular libbpf now tries to diagnose bad ELF section names at both
open time and load time.
