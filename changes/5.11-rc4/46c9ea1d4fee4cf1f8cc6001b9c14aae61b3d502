NFS/pNFS: Don't leak DS commits in pnfs_generic_retry_commit()

We must ensure that we pass a layout segment to nfs_retry_commit() when
we're cleaning up after pnfs_bucket_alloc_ds_commits(). Otherwise,
requests that should be committed to the DS will get committed to the
MDS.
Do so by ensuring that pnfs_bucket_get_committing() always tries to
return a layout segment when it returns a non-empty page list.
