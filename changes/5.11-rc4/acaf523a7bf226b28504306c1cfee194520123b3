blk-throttle: don't check whether or not lower limit is valid if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_THROTTLING_LOW is off

blk_throtl_update_limit_valid() will search for descendants to see if
'LIMIT_LOW' of bps/iops and READ/WRITE is nonzero. However, they're always
zero if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_THROTTLING_LOW is not set, furthermore, a lot of
time will be wasted to iterate descendants.

Thus do nothing in blk_throtl_update_limit_valid() in such situation.
