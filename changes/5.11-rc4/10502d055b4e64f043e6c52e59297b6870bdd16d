mlxsw: spectrum_router: Compare key with correct object type

When comparing a key with a nexthop group in rhastable's obj_cmpfn()
callback, make sure that the key and nexthop group are of the same type
(i.e., IPv4 / IPv6).

The bug is not currently visible because IPv6 nexthop groups do not
populate the FIB info pointer and IPv4 nexthop groups do not set the
ifindex for the individual nexthops.
