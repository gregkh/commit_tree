drm/ingenic: Reset pixclock rate when parent clock rate changes

Old Ingenic SoCs can overclock very well, up to +50% of their nominal
clock rate, whithout requiring overvolting or anything like that, just
by changing the rate of the main PLL. Unfortunately, all clocks on the
system are derived from that PLL, and when the PLL rate is updated, so
is our pixel clock.

To counter that issue, we make sure that the panel is in VBLANK before
the rate change happens, and we will then re-set the pixel clock rate
afterwards, once the PLL has been changed, to be as close as possible to
the pixel rate requested by the encoder.
