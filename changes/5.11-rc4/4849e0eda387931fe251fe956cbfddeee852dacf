uio/uio_pci_generic: remove unneeded pci_set_drvdata()

The pci_get_drvdata() was moved during commit ef84928cff58
("uio/uio_pci_generic: use device-managed function equivalents").

Storing a private object with pci_set_drvdata() doesn't make sense
since that change, since there is no more pci_get_drvdata() call in the
driver to retrieve the information.

This change removes it.
