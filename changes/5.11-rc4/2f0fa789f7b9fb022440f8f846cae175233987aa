drm/amd/display: Fix to be able to stop crc calculation

[Why]
Find out when we try to disable CRC calculation, crc generation is still
enabled. Main reason is that dc_stream_configure_crc() will never get
called when the source is AMDGPU_DM_PIPE_CRC_SOURCE_NONE.

[How]
Add checking condition that when source is
AMDGPU_DM_PIPE_CRC_SOURCE_NONE, we should also call
dc_stream_configure_crc() to disable crc calculation.
