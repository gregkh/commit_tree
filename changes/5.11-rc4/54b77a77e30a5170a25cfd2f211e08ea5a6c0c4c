net: hdlc_fr: Add support for any Ethertype

Change the fr_rx function to make this driver support any Ethertype
when receiving skbs on normal (non-Ethernet-emulating) PVC devices.
(This driver is already able to handle any Ethertype when sending.)

Originally in the fr_rx function, the code that parses the long (10-byte)
header only recognizes a few Ethertype values and drops frames with other
Ethertype values. This patch replaces this code to make fr_rx support
any Ethertype. This patch also creates a new function fr_snap_parse as
part of the new code.
