drm/i915/gt: Apply the CSB w/a for all

Since we expect to inline the csb_parse() routines, the w/a for the
stale CSB data on Tigerlake will be pulled into process_csb(), and so we
might as well simply reuse the logic for all, and so will hopefully
avoid any strange behaviour on Icelake that was not covered by our
previous w/a.
