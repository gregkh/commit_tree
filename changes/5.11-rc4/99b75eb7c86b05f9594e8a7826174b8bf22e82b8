gcov: remove support for GCC < 4.9

Since commit 0bddd227f3dc ("Documentation: update for gcc 4.9
requirement") the minimum supported version of GCC is gcc-4.9.  It's now
safe to remove this code.

Similar to commit 10415533a906 ("gcov: Remove old GCC 3.4 support") but
that was for GCC 4.8 and this is for GCC 4.9.
