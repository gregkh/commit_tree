pinctrl: sunxi: Always call chained_irq_{enter, exit} in sunxi_pinctrl_irq_handler

It is found on many allwinner soc that there is a low probability that
the interrupt status cannot be read in sunxi_pinctrl_irq_handler. This
will cause the interrupt status of a gpio bank to always be active on
gic, preventing gic from responding to other spi interrupts correctly.

So we should call the chained_irq_* each time enter sunxi_pinctrl_irq_handler().
