bpf: Fix selftest compilation on clang 11

Before this patch, profiler.inc.h wouldn't compile with clang-11 (before
the __builtin_preserve_enum_value LLVM builtin was introduced in
https://reviews.llvm.org/D83242).

Another test that uses this builtin (test_core_enumval) is conditionally
skipped if the compiler is too old. In that spirit, this patch inhibits
part of populate_cgroup_info(), which needs this CO-RE builtin. The
selftests build again on clang-11.

The affected test (the profiler test) doesn't pass on clang-11 because
it's missing https://reviews.llvm.org/D85570, but at least the test suite
as a whole compiles. The test's expected failure is already called out in
the README.
