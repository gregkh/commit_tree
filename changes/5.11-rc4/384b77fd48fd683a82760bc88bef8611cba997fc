Fonts: font_ter16x32: Update font with new upstream Terminus release

This is just a maintenance patch to update font_ter16x32.c with changes
and minor fixes added in new upstream Terminus v4.49.

>From release notes of new version 4.49, this brings:
- Altered ascii grave in some sizes to be more useful as a back quote.
- Fixed 21B5, added 21B2 and 21B3.

Just as my initial submission of the font, above changes were obtained from
new ter-i32b.psf font source.

Terminus font sources are available for download at SourceForge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/terminus-font/files/terminus-font-4.49/

Simply running `make` in source directory will build the .psf font files.
