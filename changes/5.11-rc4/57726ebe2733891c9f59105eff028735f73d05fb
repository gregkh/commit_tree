mlxsw: core: Add validation of transceiver temperature thresholds

Validate thresholds to avoid a single failure due to some transceiver
unreliability. Ignore the last readouts in case warning temperature is
above alarm temperature, since it can cause unexpected thermal
shutdown. Stay with the previous values and refresh threshold within
the next iteration.

This is a rare scenario, but it was observed at a customer site.
