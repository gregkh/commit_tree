mm: mmap: fix fput in error path v2

Patch "495c10cc1c0c CHROMIUM: dma-buf: restore args..."
adds a workaround for a bug in mmap_region.

As the comment states ->mmap() callback can change
vma->vm_file and so we might call fput() on the wrong file.

Revert the workaround and proper fix this in mmap_region.

v2: drop the extra if in dma_buf_mmap as well
