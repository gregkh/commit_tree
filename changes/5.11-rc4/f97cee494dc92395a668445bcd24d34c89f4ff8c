dt-bindings:iio:impedance-analyzer:adi,ad5933 yaml conversion.

The example in this one had a completely wrong compatible so I've
fixed that. Otherwise, a fairly simple conversion.

Note the driver itself is still in staging.  Looking back at the
last discussion around this, I think we were just waiting for some
test results on some refactors.  As such the binding should be stable
even if the driver might need a little more love and attention.
