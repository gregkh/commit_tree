hwmon: (applesmc) Add DMI product matches for Intel-based Xserves (non-RackMac*)

This patch adds the DMI Product ID for Intel-based Xserve machines.
They use the same SMC accessible from the same data ports.

The 'Xserve' product ID only resolves to SMC-containing
Intel-based Xserves, as the PowerPC machines are identified
by the 'RackMac' identifier.

Tested on: Xserve3,1
