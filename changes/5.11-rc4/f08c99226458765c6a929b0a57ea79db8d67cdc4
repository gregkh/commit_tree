net: ipa: populate clock and interconnect data

Populate the core clock rate and interconnect average and peak
bandwidth data for SDM845 and SC7180 in their configuration data
files.  At this point we still don't *use* this data.

Note that SC7180 actually defines a new core clock rate (100 MHz
instead of 75 MHz) and new interconnect bandwidth values.  They
will be activated in the next commit, which uses the configured
values rather than the fixed constants.
