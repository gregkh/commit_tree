printk: ringbuffer: Reference text_data_ring directly in callees.

A bunch of functions in the new ringbuffer code take both a
printk_ringbuffer struct and a separate prb_data_ring. This is a relic
from an earlier version of the code when a second data ring was present.
Since this is no longer the case remove the extra function argument
from:
 - data_make_reusable()
 - data_push_tail()
 - data_alloc()
 - data_realloc()
