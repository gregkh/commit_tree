ext4: fix bug for rename with RENAME_WHITEOUT

We got a "deleted inode referenced" warning cross our fsstress test. The
bug can be reproduced easily with following steps:

  cd /dev/shm
  mkdir test/
  fallocate -l 128M img
  mkfs.ext4 -b 1024 img
  mount img test/
  dd if=/dev/zero of=test/foo bs=1M count=128
  mkdir test/dir/ && cd test/dir/
  for ((i=0;i<1000;i++)); do touch file$i; done # consume all block
  cd ~ && renameat2(AT_FDCWD, /dev/shm/test/dir/file1, AT_FDCWD,
    /dev/shm/test/dir/dst_file, RENAME_WHITEOUT) # ext4_add_entry in
    ext4_rename will return ENOSPC!!
  cd /dev/shm/ && umount test/ && mount img test/ && ls -li test/dir/file1
  We will get the output:
  "ls: cannot access 'test/dir/file1': Structure needs cleaning"
  and the dmesg show:
  "EXT4-fs error (device loop0): ext4_lookup:1626: inode #2049: comm ls:
  deleted inode referenced: 139"

ext4_rename will create a special inode for whiteout and use this 'ino'
to replace the source file's dir entry 'ino'. Once error happens
latter(the error above was the ENOSPC return from ext4_add_entry in
ext4_rename since all space has been consumed), the cleanup do drop the
nlink for whiteout, but forget to restore 'ino' with source file. This
will trigger the bug describle as above.
