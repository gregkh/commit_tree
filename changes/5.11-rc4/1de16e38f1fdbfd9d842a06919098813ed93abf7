staging: mt7621-pci: remove 'RALINK_PCI_IMBASEBAR0_ADDR' register

Register 'RALINK_PCI_IMBASEBAR0_ADDR' contains internal memory
base address for BAR0. We don't really need to write anything
there at all since its initial value contains always a desired
valid value. Hence remove register definition and related code.
