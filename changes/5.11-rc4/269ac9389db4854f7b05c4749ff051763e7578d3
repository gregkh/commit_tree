virtio-mem: Big Block Mode (BBM) - basic memory hotunplug

Let's try to unplug completely offline big blocks first. Then, (if
enabled via unplug_offline) try to offline and remove whole big blocks.

No locking necessary - we can deal with concurrent onlining/offlining
just fine.

Note1: This is sub-optimal and might be dangerous in some environments: we
could end up in an infinite loop when offlining (e.g., long-term pinnings),
similar as with DIMMs. We'll introduce safe memory hotunplug via
fake-offlining next, and use this basic mode only when explicitly enabled.

Note2: Without ZONE_MOVABLE, memory unplug will be extremely unreliable
with bigger block sizes.
