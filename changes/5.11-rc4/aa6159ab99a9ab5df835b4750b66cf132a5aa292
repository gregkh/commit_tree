kernel.h: split out mathematical helpers

kernel.h is being used as a dump for all kinds of stuff for a long time.
Here is the attempt to start cleaning it up by splitting out
mathematical helpers.

At the same time convert users in header and lib folder to use new
header.  Though for time being include new header back to kernel.h to
avoid twisted indirected includes for existing users.
