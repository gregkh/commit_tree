s390: remove unused s390_base_ext_handler

s390_base_ext_handler_fn haven't been used since its introduction in
commit ab14de6c37fa ("[S390] Convert memory detection into C code.").

s390_base_ext_handler itself is currently falsely storing 16 registers
at __LC_SAVE_AREA_ASYNC rewriting several following lowcore values:
cpu_flags, return_psw, return_mcck_psw, sync_enter_timer and
async_enter_timer.

Besides that s390_base_ext_handler itself is only potentially hiding
EXT interrupts which should not have happen in the first place. Any
piece of code which requires EXT interrupts before fully functional
ext_int_handler is enabled has to do it on its own, like this is done
by sclp_early_cmd() which is doing EXT interrupts handling synchronously
in sclp_early_wait_irq().

With s390_base_ext_handler removed unexpected EXT interrupt leads
to disabled wait with the address 0x1b0 (__LC_EXT_NEW_PSW), which is
currently setup in the decompressor.
