mm: don't play games with pinned pages in clear_page_refs

Turning a pinned page read-only breaks the pinning after COW.  Don't do it.

The whole "track page soft dirty" state doesn't work with pinned pages
anyway, since the page might be dirtied by the pinning entity without
ever being noticed in the page tables.
