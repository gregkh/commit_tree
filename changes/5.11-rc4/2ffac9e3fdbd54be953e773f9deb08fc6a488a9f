arm64: head.S: cleanup SCTLR_ELx initialization

Let's make SCTLR_ELx initialization a bit clearer by using meaningful
names for the initialization values, following the same scheme for
SCTLR_EL1 and SCTLR_EL2.

These definitions will be used more widely in subsequent patches.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
