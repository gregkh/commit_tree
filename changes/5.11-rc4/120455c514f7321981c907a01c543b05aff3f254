sched: Fix hotplug vs CPU bandwidth control

Since we now migrate tasks away before DYING, we should also move
bandwidth unthrottle, otherwise we can gain tasks from unthrottle
after we expect all tasks to be gone already.

Also; it looks like the RT balancers don't respect cpu_active() and
instead rely on rq->online in part, complete this. This too requires
we do set_rq_offline() earlier to match the cpu_active() semantics.
(The bigger patch is to convert RT to cpu_active() entirely)

Since set_rq_online() is called from sched_cpu_activate(), place
set_rq_offline() in sched_cpu_deactivate().
