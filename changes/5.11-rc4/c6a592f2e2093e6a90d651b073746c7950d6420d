btrfs: eliminate err variable from merge_reloc_root

In most cases when an error is returned from a function 'ret' is simply
assigned to 'err'. There is only one case where walk_up_reloc_tree can
return a positive value - in this case the code breaks from the loop and
ret is going to get its return value from btrfs_cow_block - either 0 or
negative. This retains the old logic of how 'err' used to be set at
this call site.
