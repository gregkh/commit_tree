ARM: p2v: fix handling of LPAE translation in BE mode

When running in BE mode on LPAE hardware with a PA-to-VA translation
that exceeds 4 GB, we patch bits 39:32 of the offset into the wrong
byte of the opcode. So fix that, by rotating the offset in r0 to the
right by 8 bits, which will put the 8-bit immediate in bits 31:24.

Note that this will also move bit #22 in its correct place when
applying the rotation to the constant #0x400000.
