ASoC: sun8i-codec: Use the provided word size

The hardware supports 8 to 24-bit word sizes on all three of its DAIs,
only one of which is connected to the CPU DAI. Program the word size
based on the actual selected format, instead of assuming limitations
from another driver (which, incedentally, has patches pending to remove
that limitation).
