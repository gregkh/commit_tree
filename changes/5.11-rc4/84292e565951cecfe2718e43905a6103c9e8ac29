KVM: selftests: Add dirty ring buffer test

Add the initial dirty ring buffer test.

The current test implements the userspace dirty ring collection, by
only reaping the dirty ring when the ring is full.

So it's still running synchronously like this:

            vcpu                             main thread

  1. vcpu dirties pages
  2. vcpu gets dirty ring full
     (userspace exit)

                                       3. main thread waits until full
                                          (so hardware buffers flushed)
                                       4. main thread collects
                                       5. main thread continues vcpu

  6. vcpu continues, goes back to 1

We can't directly collects dirty bits during vcpu execution because
otherwise we can't guarantee the hardware dirty bits were flushed when
we collect and we're very strict on the dirty bits so otherwise we can
fail the future verify procedure.  A follow up patch will make this
test to support async just like the existing dirty log test, by adding
a vcpu kick mechanism.
