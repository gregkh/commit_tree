ALSA: hda/realtek: fix right sounds and mute/micmute LEDs for HP machines

 * The HP ZBook Fury 15/17 G7 Mobile Workstation are using ALC285 codec
   which is using 0x04 to control mute LED and 0x01 to control micmute LED.

 * The right channel speaker is no sound and it needs to expose GPIO1 for
   initialing AMP.

Add quirks to support them.
