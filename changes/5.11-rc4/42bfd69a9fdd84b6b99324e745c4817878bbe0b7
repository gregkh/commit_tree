sfc: correctly support non-partial GSO_UDP_TUNNEL_CSUM on EF100

By asking the HW for the correct edits, we can make UDP tunnel TSO
 work without needing GSO_PARTIAL.  So don't specify it in our
 netdev->gso_partial_features.
However, retain GSO_PARTIAL support, as this will be used for other
 protocols later.
