io_uring: only plug when appropriate

We unconditionally call blk_start_plug() when starting the IO
submission, but we only really should do that if we have more than 1
request to submit AND we're potentially dealing with block based storage
underneath. For any other type of request, it's just a waste of time to
do so.

Add a ->plug bit to io_op_def and set it for read/write requests. We
could make this more precise and check the file itself as well, but it
doesn't matter that much and would quickly become more expensive.
