drm/i915: Do not call drm_crtc_arm_vblank_event in async flips

Since the flip done event will be sent in the flip_done_handler,
no need to add the event to the list and delay it for later.

v2: -Moved the async check above vblank_get as it
     was causing issues for PSR.

v3: -No need to wait for vblank to pass, as this wait was causing a
     16ms delay once every few flips.

v4: -Rebased.

v5: -Rebased.

v6: -Rebased.

v7: -No need of irq disable if we are not doing vblank evade. (Ville)

v8: -Rebased.

v9: -Move the return in intel_pipe_update_end before tracepoint. (Ville)

v10: Rebased.
