drm/i915/dp: Tweak initial dpcd backlight.enabled value

In commit 79946723092b ("drm/i915: Assume 100% brightness when not in
DPCD control mode"), we fixed the brightness level when DPCD control was
not active to max brightness. This is as good as we can guess since most
backlights go on full when uncontrolled.

However in doing so we changed the semantics of the initial
'backlight.enabled' value. At least on Pixelbooks, they  were relying
on the brightness level in DP_EDP_BACKLIGHT_BRIGHTNESS_MSB to be 0 on
boot such that enabled would be false. This causes the device to be
enabled when the brightness is set. Without this, brightness control
doesn't work. So by changing brightness to max, we also flipped enabled
to be true on boot.

To fix this, make enabled a function of brightness and backlight control
mechanism.
