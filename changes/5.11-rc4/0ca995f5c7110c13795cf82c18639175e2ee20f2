clk: renesas: r8a779a0: Make rcar_r8a779a0_cpg_clk_register() static

When compiling with clang:

    drivers/clk/renesas/r8a779a0-cpg-mssr.c:156:21: warning: no previous prototype for function 'rcar_r8a779a0_cpg_clk_register' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
    struct clk * __init rcar_r8a779a0_cpg_clk_register(struct device *dev,
			   ^
    drivers/clk/renesas/r8a779a0-cpg-mssr.c:156:1: note: declare 'static' if the function is not intended to be used outside of this translation unit
    struct clk * __init rcar_r8a779a0_cpg_clk_register(struct device *dev,
    ^
    static

Similarly, with sparse:

    drivers/clk/renesas/r8a779a0-cpg-mssr.c:156:12: warning: symbol 'rcar_r8a779a0_cpg_clk_register' was not declared. Should it be static?

There are no users of rcar_r8a779a0_cpg_clk_register() outside this
file, so it should be static.
