s390/qeth: don't replace a fully completed async TX buffer

For TX buffers that require an additional async notification via QAOB, the
TX completion code can now manage all the necessary processing if the
notification has already occurred (or is occurring concurrently).

In such cases we can avoid replacing the metadata that is associated
with the buffer's slot on the ring, and just keep using the current one.

As qeth_clear_output_buffer() will also handle any kmem cache-allocated
memory that was mapped into the TX buffer, qeth_qdio_handle_aob()
doesn't need to worry about it.

While at it, also remove the unneeded forward declaration for
qeth_init_qdio_out_buf().
