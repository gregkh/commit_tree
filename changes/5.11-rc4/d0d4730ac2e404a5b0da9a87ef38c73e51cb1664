userfaultfd: add user-mode only option to unprivileged_userfaultfd sysctl knob

With this change, when the knob is set to 0, it allows unprivileged users
to call userfaultfd, like when it is set to 1, but with the restriction
that page faults from only user-mode can be handled.  In this mode, an
unprivileged user (without SYS_CAP_PTRACE capability) must pass
UFFD_USER_MODE_ONLY to userfaultd or the API will fail with EPERM.

This enables administrators to reduce the likelihood that an attacker with
access to userfaultfd can delay faulting kernel code to widen timing
windows for other exploits.

The default value of this knob is changed to 0.  This is required for
correct functioning of pipe mutex.  However, this will fail postcopy live
migration, which will be unnoticeable to the VM guests.  To avoid this,
set 'vm.userfault = 1' in /sys/sysctl.conf.

The main reason this change is desirable as in the short term is that the
Android userland will behave as with the sysctl set to zero.  So without
this commit, any Linux binary using userfaultfd to manage its memory would
behave differently if run within the Android userland.  For more details,
refer to Andrea's reply [1].
