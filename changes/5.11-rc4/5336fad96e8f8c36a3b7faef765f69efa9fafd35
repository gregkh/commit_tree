wcn36xx: Enable firmware offloaded keepalive

This patch calls wcn36xx_smd_keep_alive_req() on the STA patch immediately
after associating with an AP.

This will cause the firmware to send a NULL packet out to the AP every 30
seconds, thus offloading keep-alive processing from the SoC to the
firmware.
