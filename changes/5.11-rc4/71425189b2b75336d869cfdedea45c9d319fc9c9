blk-mq: Don't complete on a remote CPU in force threaded mode

With force threaded interrupts enabled, raising softirq from an SMP
function call will always result in waking the ksoftirqd thread. This is
not optimal given that the thread runs at SCHED_OTHER priority.

Completing the request in hard IRQ-context on PREEMPT_RT (which enforces
the force threaded mode) is bad because the completion handler may
acquire sleeping locks which violate the locking context.

Disable request completing on a remote CPU in force threaded mode.
