drm/i915/gvt: Fix vfio_edid issue for BXT/APL

BXT/APL has different isr/irr/hpd regs compared with other GEN9. If not
setting these regs bits correctly according to the emulated monitor
(currently a DP on PORT_B), although gvt still triggers a virtual HPD
event, the guest driver won't detect a valid HPD pulse thus no full
display detection will be executed to read the updated EDID.

With this patch, the vfio_edid is enabled again on BXT/APL, which is
previously disabled.
