cppc_cpufreq: clean up cpu, cpu_num and cpunum variable use

In order to maintain the typical naming convention in the cpufreq
framework:

 - replace the use of "cpu" variable name for cppc_cpudata pointers
   with "cpu_data"
 - replace variable names "cpu_num" and "cpunum" with "cpu"
 - make cpu variables unsigned int

Where pertinent, also move the initialisation of cpu_data variable to
its declaration and make consistent use of the local "cpu" variable.
