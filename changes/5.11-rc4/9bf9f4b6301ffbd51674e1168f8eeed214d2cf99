Bluetooth: Use intervals and tx power from mgmt cmds

This patch takes the min/max intervals and tx power optionally provided
in mgmt interface, stores them in the advertisement struct, and uses
them when configuring the hci requests. While tx power is not used if
extended advertising is unavailable, software rotation will use the min
and max advertising intervals specified by the client.

This change is validated manually by ensuring the min/max intervals are
propagated to the controller on both hatch (extended advertising) and
kukui (no extended advertising) chromebooks, and that tx power is
propagated correctly on hatch. These tests are performed with multiple
advertisements simultaneously.
