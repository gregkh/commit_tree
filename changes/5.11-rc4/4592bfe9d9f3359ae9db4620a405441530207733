arm64: dts: meson: Add capacity-dmips-mhz attributes to GXM

GXM (S912) is a big-little design with CPUs 0-3 clocked at 1.5GHz
and CPUs 4-7 at 1.0GHz. Adding capacity-dmips-mhz attributes allows
the scheduler to factor the different clock speeds into capacity
calculations and prefer the higher-clocked cluster to improve
overall performance.

This was inspired by the similar change for G12B [0] boards. The
diference here is that all cores are A53's so the same dmips-mhz
value is used.

VIM2:~ # cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
1512000
1512000
1512000
1512000
1000000
1000000
1000000
1000000

before:

VIM2:~ # cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpu_capacity
1024
1024
1024
1024
1024
1024
1024
1024

after:

VIM2:~ # cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpu_capacity
1024
1024
1024
1024
677
677
677
677

The after value matches my table-napkin calculation:

(1000000 / 1512000 = 0.661) * 1024 = 677
