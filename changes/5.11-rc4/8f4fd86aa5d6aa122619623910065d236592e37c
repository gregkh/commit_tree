xen: Set platform PCI device INTX affinity to CPU0

With INTX or GSI delivery, Xen uses the event channel structures of CPU0.

If the interrupt gets handled by Linux on a different CPU, then no events
are seen as pending. Rather than introducing locking to allow other CPUs
to process CPU0's events, just ensure that the PCI interrupts happens
only on CPU0.
