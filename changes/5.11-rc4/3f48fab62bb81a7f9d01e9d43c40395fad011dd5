net: mvpp2: Add TCAM entry to drop flow control pause frames

Issue:
Flow control frame used to pause GoP(MAC) was delivered to the CPU
and created a load on the CPU. Since XOFF/XON frames are used only
by MAC, these frames should be dropped inside MAC.

Fix:
According to 802.3-2012 - IEEE Standard for Ethernet pause frame
has unique destination MAC address 01-80-C2-00-00-01.
Add TCAM parser entry to track and drop pause frames by destination MAC.
