powerpc: Fix alignment bug within the init sections

This is a bug that causes early crashes in builds with an .exit.text
section smaller than a page and an .init.text section that ends in the
beginning of a physical page (this is kinda random, which might
explain why this wasn't really encountered before).

The init sections are ordered like this:
  .init.text
  .exit.text
  .init.data

Currently, these sections aren't page aligned.

Because the init code might become read-only at runtime and because
the .init.text section can potentially reside on the same physical
page as .init.data, the beginning of .init.data might be mapped
read-only along with .init.text.

Then when the kernel tries to modify a variable in .init.data (like
kthreadd_done, used in kernel_init()) the kernel panics.

To avoid this, make _einittext page aligned and also align .exit.text
to make sure .init.data is always seperated from the text segments.
