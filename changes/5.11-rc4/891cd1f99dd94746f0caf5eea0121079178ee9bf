rcu: Un-hide lockdep maps for !LOCKDEP

Currently, variables used only within lockdep expressions are flagged as
unused, requiring that these variables' declarations be decorated with
either #ifdef or __maybe_unused.  This results in ugly code.  This commit
therefore causes the RCU lock maps to be visible even when lockdep is not
enabled, thus removing the need for these decorations.  This approach
further relies on dead-code elimination to remove any references to
functions or variables that are not available in non-lockdep kernels.
