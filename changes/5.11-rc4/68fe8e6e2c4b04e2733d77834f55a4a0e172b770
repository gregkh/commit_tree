platform/x86: Intel PMT Telemetry capability driver

PMT Telemetry is a capability of the Intel Platform Monitoring Technology.
The Telemetry capability provides access to device telemetry metrics that
provide hardware performance data to users from read-only register spaces.

With this driver present the intel_pmt directory can be populated with
telem<x> devices. These devices will contain the standard intel_pmt sysfs
data and a "telem" binary sysfs attribute which can be used to access the
telemetry data.

Also create a PCI device id list for early telemetry hardware that require
workarounds for known issues.
