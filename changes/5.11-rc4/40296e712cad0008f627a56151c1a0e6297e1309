media: camss: vfe: Add support for VFE 4.8

Add the support for VFE 4.8 in the camss-vfe-4-7 driver, as this one
really is a minor revision, requiring the very same management and
basically having the same register layout as VFE 4.7, but needing
a different QoS and DS configuration, using a different register to
enable the wm and habing the same UB size for both instances (instead
of a different size between instance 0 and 1).
