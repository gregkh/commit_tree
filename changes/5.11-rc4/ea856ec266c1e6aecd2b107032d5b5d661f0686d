platform/x86: asus-wmi: Add support for SW_TABLET_MODE on UX360

The UX360CA has a WMI device id 0x00060062, which reports whether the
lid is flipped in tablet mode (1) or in normal laptop mode (0).

Add a quirk (quirk_asus_use_lid_flip_devid) for devices on which this
WMI device should be used to figure out the SW_TABLET_MODE state, as
opposed to the quirk_asus_use_kbd_dock_devid.

Additionally, the device needs to be queried on resume and restore
because the firmware does not generate an event if the laptop is put to
sleep while in tablet mode, flipped to normal mode, and later awoken.

It is assumed other UX360* models have the same WMI device. As such, the
quirk is applied to devices with DMI_MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, "UX360").
More devices with this feature need to be tested and added accordingly.

The reason for using an allowlist via the quirk mechanism is that the new
WMI device (0x00060062) is also present on some models which do not have
a 360 degree hinge (at least FX503VD and GL503VD from Hans' DSTS
collection) and therefore its presence cannot be relied on.
