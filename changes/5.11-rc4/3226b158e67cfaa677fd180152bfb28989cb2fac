net: avoid 32 x truesize under-estimation for tiny skbs

Both virtio net and napi_get_frags() allocate skbs
with a very small skb->head

While using page fragments instead of a kmalloc backed skb->head might give
a small performance improvement in some cases, there is a huge risk of
under estimating memory usage.

For both GOOD_COPY_LEN and GRO_MAX_HEAD, we can fit at least 32 allocations
per page (order-3 page in x86), or even 64 on PowerPC

We have been tracking OOM issues on GKE hosts hitting tcp_mem limits
but consuming far more memory for TCP buffers than instructed in tcp_mem[2]

Even if we force napi_alloc_skb() to only use order-0 pages, the issue
would still be there on arches with PAGE_SIZE >= 32768

This patch makes sure that small skb head are kmalloc backed, so that
other objects in the slab page can be reused instead of being held as long
as skbs are sitting in socket queues.

Note that we might in the future use the sk_buff napi cache,
instead of going through a more expensive __alloc_skb()

Another idea would be to use separate page sizes depending
on the allocated length (to never have more than 4 frags per page)

I would like to thank Greg Thelen for his precious help on this matter,
analysing crash dumps is always a time consuming task.
