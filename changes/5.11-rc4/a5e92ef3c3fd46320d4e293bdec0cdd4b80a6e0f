drm: Check actual format for legacy pageflip.

With modifiers one can actually have different format_info structs
for the same format, which now matters for AMDGPU since we convert
implicit modifiers to explicit modifiers with multiple planes.

I checked other drivers and it doesn't look like they end up triggering
this case so I think this is safe to relax.
