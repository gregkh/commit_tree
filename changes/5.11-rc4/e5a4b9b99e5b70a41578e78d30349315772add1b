clk: avoid devm_clk_release name clash

In clk-devres.c, devm_clk_release() is used to call clk_put() memory
managed clock. In clk.c the same name, in a different scope is used to call
clk_unregister().

As it stands, it is not really a problem but it does not readability,
especially if we need to call clk_put() on managed clock in clk.c
