KVM: arm64: Trap host SMCs in protected mode

While protected KVM is installed, start trapping all host SMCs.
For now these are simply forwarded to EL3, except PSCI
CPU_ON/CPU_SUSPEND/SYSTEM_SUSPEND which are intercepted and the
hypervisor installed on newly booted cores.

Create new constant HCR_HOST_NVHE_PROTECTED_FLAGS with the new set of HCR
flags to use while the nVHE vector is installed when the kernel was
booted with the protected flag enabled. Switch back to the default HCR
flags when switching back to the stub vector.
