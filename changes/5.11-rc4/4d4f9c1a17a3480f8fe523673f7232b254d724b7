MIPS: boot: Fix unaligned access with CONFIG_MIPS_RAW_APPENDED_DTB

The compressed payload is not necesarily 4-byte aligned, at least when
compiling with Clang. In that case, the 4-byte value appended to the
compressed payload that corresponds to the uncompressed kernel image
size must be read using get_unaligned_le32().

This fixes Clang-built kernels not booting on MIPS (tested on a Ingenic
JZ4770 board).

Fixes: b8f54f2cde78 ("MIPS: ZBOOT: copy appended dtb to the end of the kernel")
