RISC-V: Set current memblock limit

Currently, linux kernel can not use last 4k bytes of addressable space
because IS_ERR_VALUE macro treats those as an error. This will be an issue
for RV32 as any memblock allocator potentially allocate chunk of memory
from the end of DRAM (2GB) leading bad address error even though the
address was technically valid.

Fix this issue by limiting the memblock if available memory spans the
entire address space.
