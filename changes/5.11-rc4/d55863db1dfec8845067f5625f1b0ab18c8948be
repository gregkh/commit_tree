arm64/mm: Implement pXX_leaf_size() support

ARM64 has non-pagetable aligned large page support with PTE_CONT, when
this bit is set the page is part of a super-page. Match the hugetlb
code and support these super pages for PTE and PMD levels.

This enables PERF_SAMPLE_{DATA,CODE}_PAGE_SIZE to report accurate
pagetable leaf sizes.
