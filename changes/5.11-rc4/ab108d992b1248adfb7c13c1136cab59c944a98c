btrfs: use precalculated sectorsize_bits from fs_info

We do a lot of calculations where we divide or multiply by sectorsize.
We also know and make sure that sectorsize is a power of two, so this
means all divisions can be turned to shifts and avoid eg. expensive
u64/u32 divisions.

The type is u32 as it's more register friendly on x86_64 compared to u8
and the resulting assembly is smaller (movzbl vs movl).

There's also superblock s_blocksize_bits but it's usually one more
pointer dereference farther than fs_info.
