btrfs: do not start and wait for delalloc on snapshot roots on transaction commit

We do not need anymore to start writeback for delalloc of roots that are
being snapshotted and wait for it to complete. This was done in commit
609e804d771f59 ("Btrfs: fix file corruption after snapshotting due to mix
of buffered/DIO writes") to fix a type of file corruption where files in a
snapshot end up having their i_size updated in a non-ordered way, leaving
implicit file holes, when buffered IO writes that increase a file's size
are followed by direct IO writes that also increase the file's size.

This is not needed anymore because we now have a more generic mechanism
to prevent a non-ordered i_size update since commit 9ddc959e802bf7
("btrfs: use the file extent tree infrastructure"), which addresses this
scenario involving snapshots as well.
