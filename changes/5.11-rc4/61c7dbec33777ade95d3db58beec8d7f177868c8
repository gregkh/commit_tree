ASoC: rsnd: don't call clk_disable_unprepare() if can't use

We need to care clock accessibility,
because we might can't use clock for some reasons.

It sets clk_rate for each clocks when enabled.
This means it doesn't have clk_rate if we can't use.
We can avoid to call clk_disable_unprepare() in such case.
