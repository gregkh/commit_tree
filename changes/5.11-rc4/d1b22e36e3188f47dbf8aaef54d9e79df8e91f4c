Documentation/x86: Rename resctrl_ui.rst and add two errata to the file

Intel Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM) counters may report system
memory bandwidth incorrectly on some Intel processors. This is reported
in documented in erratum SKX99, erratum BDF102 and in the RDT reference
manual, see Documentation/x86/index.rst.

To work around the errata, MBM total and local readings are corrected
using a correction factor table.

Since the correction factor table is not publicly documented anywhere,
document the table and the errata in Documentation/x86/resctrl.rst for
future reference.
