s390/ctcm: Avoid temporary allocation of struct qllc.

The size of struct qllc is 2 byte. The memory for is allocated,
initialized, used and deallocated a few lines later.

It is more efficient to avoid the allocation/free dance and assign the
values directly to skb's data part instead of using memcpy() for it.

Avoid an allocation of struct qllc and use the resulting skb pointer
instead.
