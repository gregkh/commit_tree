arm64: dts: qcom: Switch sc7180-trogdor to control SPI CS via GPIO

As talked about in the patch ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Provide
pinconf for SPI to use GPIO for CS"), on some boards it makes much
more sense (and is much more efficient) to think of the SPI Chip
Select as a GPIO.  Trogdor is one such board where the SPI parts don't
run in GSI mode and we do a lot of SPI traffic.
