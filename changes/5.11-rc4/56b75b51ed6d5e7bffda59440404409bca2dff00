iommu/arm-smmu: Allow implementation specific write_s2cr

The firmware found in some Qualcomm platforms intercepts writes to the
S2CR register in order to replace the BYPASS type with FAULT. Further
more it treats faults at this level as catastrophic and restarts the
device.

Add support for providing implementation specific versions of the S2CR
write function, to allow the Qualcomm driver to work around this
behavior.
