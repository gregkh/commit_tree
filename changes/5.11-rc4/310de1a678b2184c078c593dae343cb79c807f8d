entry: Add exit_to_user_mode() wrapper

Called from architecture specific code when syscall_exit_to_user_mode() is
not suitable. It simply calls __exit_to_user_mode().

This way __exit_to_user_mode() can still be inlined because it is declared
static __always_inline.

[ tglx: Amended comments and moved it to a different place in the header ]
