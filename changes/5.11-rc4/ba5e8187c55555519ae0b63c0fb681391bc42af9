nfsd: allow filesystems to opt out of subtree checking

When we start allowing NFS to be reexported, then we have some problems
when it comes to subtree checking. In principle, we could allow it, but
it would mean encoding parent info in the filehandles and there may not
be enough space for that in a NFSv3 filehandle.

To enforce this at export upcall time, we add a new export_ops flag
that declares the filesystem ineligible for subtree checking.
