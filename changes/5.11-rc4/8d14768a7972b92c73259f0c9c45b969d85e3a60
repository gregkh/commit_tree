ice, xsk: clear the status bits for the next_to_use descriptor

On the Rx side, the next_to_use index points to the next item in the
HW ring to be refilled/allocated, and next_to_clean points to the next
item to potentially be processed.

When the HW Rx ring is fully refilled, i.e. no packets has been
processed, the next_to_use will be next_to_clean - 1. When the ring is
fully processed next_to_clean will be equal to next_to_use. The latter
case is where a bug is triggered.

If the next_to_use bits are not cleared, and the "fully processed"
state is entered, a stale descriptor can be processed.

The skb-path correctly clear the status bit for the next_to_use
descriptor, but the AF_XDP zero-copy path did not do that.

This change adds the status bits clearing of the next_to_use
descriptor.
