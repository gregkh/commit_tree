cifs: check pointer before freeing

clang static analysis reports this problem

dfs_cache.c:591:2: warning: Argument to kfree() is a constant address
  (18446744073709551614), which is not memory allocated by malloc()
        kfree(vi);
        ^~~~~~~~~

In dfs_cache_del_vol() the volume info pointer 'vi' being freed
is the return of a call to find_vol().  The large constant address
is find_vol() returning an error.

Add an error check to dfs_cache_del_vol() similar to the one done
in dfs_cache_update_vol().
