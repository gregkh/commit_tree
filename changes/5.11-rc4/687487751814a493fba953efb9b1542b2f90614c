bnxt_en: Clear DEFRAG flag in firmware message when retry flashing.

When the FW tells the driver to retry the INSTALL_UPDATE command after
it has cleared the NVM area, the driver is not clearing the previously
used ALLOWED_TO_DEFRAG flag. As a result the FW tries to defrag the NVM
area a second time in a loop and can fail the request.
