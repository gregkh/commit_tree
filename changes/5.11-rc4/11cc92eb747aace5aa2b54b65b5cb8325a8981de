genirq: Fix export of irq_to_desc() for powerpc KVM

Commit 64a1b95bb9fe ("genirq: Restrict export of irq_to_desc()") removed
the export of irq_to_desc() unless powerpc KVM is being built, because
there is still a use of irq_to_desc() in modular code there.

However it used:

  #ifdef CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV

Which doesn't work when that symbol is =m, leading to a build failure:

  ERROR: modpost: "irq_to_desc" [arch/powerpc/kvm/kvm-hv.ko] undefined!

Fix it by checking for the definedness of the correct symbol which is
CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV_MODULE.
