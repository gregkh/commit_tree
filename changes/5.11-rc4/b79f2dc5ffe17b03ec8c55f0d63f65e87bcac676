RDMA/umem: Avoid undefined behavior of rounddown_pow_of_two()

rounddown_pow_of_two() is undefined when the input is 0. Therefore we need
to avoid it in ib_umem_find_best_pgsz and return 0.  Otherwise, it could
result in not rejecting an invalid page size which eventually causes a
kernel oops due to the logical inconsistency.
