scsi: ufs: Correct the LUN used in eh_device_reset_handler() callback

Users can initiate resets to specific SCSI device/target/host through
IOCTL. When this happens, the SCSI cmd passed to eh_device/target/host
_reset_handler() callbacks is initialized with a request whose tag is -1.
In this case it is not right for eh_device_reset_handler() callback to
count on the LUN get from hba->lrb[-1]. Fix it by getting LUN from the SCSI
device associated with the SCSI cmd.
