Input: ads7846 - fix integer overflow on Rt calculation

In some rare cases the 32 bit Rt value will overflow if z2 and x is max,
z1 is minimal value and x_plate_ohms is relatively high (for example 800
ohm). This would happen on some screen age with low pressure.

There are two possible fixes:
- make Rt 64bit
- reorder calculation to avoid overflow

The second variant seems to be preferable, since 64 bit calculation on
32 bit system is a bit more expensive.
