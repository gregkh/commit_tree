KVM: arm64: Inject UNDEF on PMU access when no PMU configured

The ARMv8 architecture says that in the absence of FEAT_PMUv3,
all the PMU-related register generate an UNDEF. Let's make
sure that all our PMU handers catch this case by hooking into
check_pmu_access_disabled(), and add checks in a couple of
other places.

Note that we still cannot deliver an exception into the guest
as the offending cases are already caught by the RAZ/WI handling.
But this puts us one step away to architectural compliance.
