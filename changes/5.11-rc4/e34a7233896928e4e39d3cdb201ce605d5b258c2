thermal: power allocator: change the 'k_i' coefficient estimation

Intelligent Power Allocation (IPA) is built around the PID controller
concept. The initialization code tries to setup the environment based on
the information available in DT or estimate the value based on minimum
power reported by each of the cooling device. The estimation will have an
impact on the PID controller behaviour via the related 'k_po', 'k_pu',
'k_i' coefficients and also on the power budget calculation.

This change prevents the situation when 'k_i' is relatively big compared
to 'k_po' and 'k_pu' values. This might happen when the estimation for
'sustainable_power' returned small value, thus 'k_po' and 'k_pu' are
small.
