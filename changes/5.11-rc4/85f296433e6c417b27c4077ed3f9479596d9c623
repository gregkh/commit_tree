ARM: dts: sun8i: V3/S3: Add UART1 pin definitions to the V3/S3 dtsi

The Allwinner V3 and S3 can use PG6/7 as RX/TX for UART1. Since no other
functions are assigned to those pins, they are a convenient choice for
a debugging or application UART.
This is specific to V3/S3 as the V3s's non-BGA package did not have
those pins.
