genirq/msi: Allow shadow declarations of msi_msg:: $member

Architectures like x86 have their MSI messages in various bits of the data,
address_lo and address_hi field. Composing or decomposing these messages
with bitmasks and shifts is possible, but unreadable gunk.

Allow architectures to provide an architecture specific representation for
each member of msi_msg. Provide empty defaults for each and stick them into
an union.
