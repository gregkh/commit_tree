block: add an optional probe callback to major_names

Add a callback to the major_names array that allows a driver to override
how to probe for dev_t that doesn't currently have a gendisk registered.
This will help separating the lookup of the gendisk by dev_t vs probe
action for a not currently registered dev_t.
