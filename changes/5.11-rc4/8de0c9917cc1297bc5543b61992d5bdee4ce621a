EDAC/mce_amd: Use struct cpuinfo_x86.cpu_die_id for AMD NodeId

The edac_mce_amd module calls decode_dram_ecc() on AMD Family17h and
later systems. This function is used in amd64_edac_mod to do
system-specific decoding for DRAM ECC errors. The function takes a
"NodeId" as a parameter.

In AMD documentation, NodeId is used to identify a physical die in a
system. This can be used to identify a node in the AMD_NB code and also
it is used with umc_normaddr_to_sysaddr().

However, the input used for decode_dram_ecc() is currently the NUMA node
of a logical CPU. In the default configuration, the NUMA node and
physical die will be equivalent, so this doesn't have an impact.

But the NUMA node configuration can be adjusted with optional memory
interleaving modes. This will cause the NUMA node enumeration to not
match the physical die enumeration. The mismatch will cause the address
translation function to fail or report incorrect results.

Use struct cpuinfo_x86.cpu_die_id for the node_id parameter to ensure the
physical ID is used.
