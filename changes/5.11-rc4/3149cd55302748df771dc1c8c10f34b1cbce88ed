x86: Print ratio freq_max/freq_base used in frequency invariance calculations

The value freq_max/freq_base is a fundamental component of frequency
invariance calculations. It may come from a variety of sources such as MSRs
or ACPI data, tracking it down when troubleshooting a system could be
non-trivial. It is worth saving it in the kernel logs.

 # dmesg | grep 'Estimated ratio of average max'
 [   14.024036] smpboot: Estimated ratio of average max frequency by base frequency (times 1024): 1289
