hv_balloon: do adjust_managed_page_count() when ballooning/un-ballooning

Unlike virtio_balloon/virtio_mem/xen balloon drivers, Hyper-V balloon driver
does not adjust managed pages count when ballooning/un-ballooning and this leads
to incorrect stats being reported, e.g. unexpected 'free' output.

Note, the calculation in post_status() seems to remain correct: ballooned out
pages are never 'available' and we manually add dm->num_pages_ballooned to
'commited'.
