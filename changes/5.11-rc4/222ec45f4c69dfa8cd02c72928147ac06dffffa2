drm/fb_helper: Support framebuffers in I/O memory

At least sparc64 requires I/O-specific access to framebuffers. This
patch updates the fbdev console accordingly.

For drivers with direct access to the framebuffer memory, the callback
functions in struct fb_ops test for the type of memory and call the rsp
fb_sys_ of fb_cfb_ functions. Read and write operations are implemented
internally by DRM's fbdev helper.

For drivers that employ a shadow buffer, fbdev's blit function retrieves
the framebuffer address as struct dma_buf_map, and uses dma_buf_map
interfaces to access the buffer.

The bochs driver on sparc64 uses a workaround to flag the framebuffer as
I/O memory and avoid a HW exception. With the introduction of struct
dma_buf_map, this is not required any longer. The patch removes the rsp
code from both, bochs and fbdev.

v7:
	* use min_t(size_t,) (kernel test robot)
	* return the number of bytes read/written, if any (fbdev testcase)
v5:
	* implement fb_read/fb_write internally (Daniel, Sam)
v4:
	* move dma_buf_map changes into separate patch (Daniel)
	* TODO list: comment on fbdev updates (Daniel)
