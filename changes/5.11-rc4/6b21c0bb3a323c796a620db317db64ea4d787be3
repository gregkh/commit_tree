net: x25: Fix handling of Restart Request and Restart Confirmation

1. When the x25 module gets loaded, layer 2 may already be running and
connected. In this case, although we are in X25_LINK_STATE_0, we still
need to handle the Restart Request received, rather than ignore it.

2. When we are in X25_LINK_STATE_2, we have already sent a Restart Request
and is waiting for the Restart Confirmation with t20timer. t20timer will
restart itself repeatedly forever so it will always be there, as long as we
are in State 2. So we don't need to check x25_t20timer_pending again.
