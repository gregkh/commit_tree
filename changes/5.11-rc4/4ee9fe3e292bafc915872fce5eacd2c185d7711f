clk: qcom: lpass-sc7180: Disentangle the two clock devices

The sc7180 lpass clock driver manages two different devices.  These
two devices were tangled together, using one probe and a lookup to
figure out the real probe.  I think it's cleaner to really separate
the probe for these two devices since they're really different things,
just both managed by the same driver.
