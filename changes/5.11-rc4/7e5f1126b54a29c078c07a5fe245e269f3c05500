MAINTAINERS: add Vlastimil as slab allocators maintainer

I would like to help with slab allocators maintenance, from the
perspective of being responsible for SLAB and more recently also SLUB in
an enterprise distro kernel and supporting its users.  Recently I've
been focusing on improving SLUB's debugging features, and patch review
in the area, including the kmemcg accounting rewrite last year.
