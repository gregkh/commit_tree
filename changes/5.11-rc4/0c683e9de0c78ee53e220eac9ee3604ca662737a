x86/platform/uv: Make uv_pcibus_kset and uv_hubs_kset static

Fix the following sparse warnings:

  drivers/platform/x86/uv_sysfs.c:22:13: warning: symbol \
	  'uv_pcibus_kset' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/platform/x86/uv_sysfs.c:23:13: warning: symbol \
	  'uv_hubs_kset' was not declared. Should it be static?
