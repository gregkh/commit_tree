usb: typec: intel_pmc_mux: Use correct response message bits

When Intel PMC Mux agent driver receives the response message from PMC, it
checks for the same response bits for all the mux states.
Corrected it by checking correct response message bits, Bit 8 & 9 for the
SAFE Mode and Alternate Modes and Bit 16 & 17 for the Connect and
Disconnect Modes.
