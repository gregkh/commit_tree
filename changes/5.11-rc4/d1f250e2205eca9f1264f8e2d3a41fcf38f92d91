x86: Support HAVE_CONTEXT_TRACKING_OFFSTACK

A lot of ground work has been performed on x86 entry code. Fragile path
between user_enter() and user_exit() have IRQs disabled. Uses of RCU and
intrumentation in these fragile areas have been explicitly annotated
and protected.

This architecture doesn't need exception_enter()/exception_exit()
anymore and has therefore earned CONFIG_HAVE_CONTEXT_TRACKING_OFFSTACK.
