Bluetooth: btrtl: Refine the ic_id_table for clearer and more regular

Enhance the ic_id_table that it's able to maintain regularly.
To judge which chip should be initialized by LMP subversion, HCI revision,
 HCI version and HCI bus which were given in the ic_id_table.
Also, refine the incorrect LMP subversion of ROM for RTL8723D and
RTL8723A.
