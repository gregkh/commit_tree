media: ccs-pll: Add support for decoupled OP domain calculation

Add support for decoupled OP domain clock calculation. This means that the
number of VT and OP domain clocks are no longer dependent on the number of
CSI-2 lanes in the lane speed mode.

The support also replaces the existing quirk flag to calculate OP domain
clocks per lane.

Also support decoupled OP domain calculation in the CCS driver.
