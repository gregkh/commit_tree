umount(2): move the flag validity checks first

Unfortunately, there's userland code that used to rely upon these
checks being done before anything else to check for UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW
support.  That broke in 41525f56e256 ("fs: refactor ksys_umount").
Separate those from the rest of checks and move them to ksys_umount();
unlike everything else in there, this can be sanely done there.
