media: tm6000: Fix sizeof() mismatches

The are two instances of sizeof() being used incorrectly. The
sizeof(void *) is incorrect because urb_buffer is a char ** pointer,
fix this by using sizeof(*dev->urb_buffer).  The sizeof(dma_addr_t *)
is incorrect, it should be sizeof(*dev->urb_dma), which is a dma_addr_t
and not a dma_addr_t *.  This errors did not cause any issues because
it just so happens the sizes are the same.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Sizeof not portable (SIZEOF_MISMATCH)")
