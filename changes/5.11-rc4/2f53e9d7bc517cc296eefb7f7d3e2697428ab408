r8169: improve rtl_rx

There's no need to check min(budget, NUM_RX_DESC). At first budget
(NAPI_POLL_WEIGHT = 64) is less then NUM_RX_DESC (256).
And more important: Even in case of budget > NUM_RX_DESC we could
safely continue processing descriptors as long as they are owned by
the CPU. In addition replace rx_left with a normal counter variable,
this allows to simplify the code. Last but not least there's no need
any longer to pass the budget as an u32.
