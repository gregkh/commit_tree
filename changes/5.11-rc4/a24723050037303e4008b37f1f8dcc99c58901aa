remoteproc: q6v5-mss: fix error handling in q6v5_pds_enable

If the pm_runtime_get_sync failed in q6v5_pds_enable when
loop (i), The unroll_pd_votes will start from (i - 1), and
it will resulted in following problems:

  1) pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even it
     failed. Forgetting to pm_runtime_put_noidle will result in
     reference leak.

  2) Have not reset pds[i] performance state.

Then we fix it.
