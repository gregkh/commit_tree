spi: mt7621: Disable clock in probe error path

Commit 702b15cb9712 ("spi: mt7621: fix missing clk_disable_unprepare()
on error in mt7621_spi_probe") sought to disable the SYS clock on probe
errors, but only did so for 2 of 3 potentially failing calls:  The clock
needs to be disabled on failure of devm_spi_register_controller() as
well.

Moreover, the commit purports to fix a bug in commit cbd66c626e16 ("spi:
mt7621: Move SPI driver out of staging") but in reality the bug has
existed since the driver was first introduced.
