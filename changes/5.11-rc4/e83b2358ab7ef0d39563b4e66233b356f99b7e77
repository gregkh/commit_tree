soc: ti: Kconfig: Drop ARM64 SoC specific configs

With the integration of chip-id detection scheme in kernel[1], there
is no specific need to maintain multitudes of SoC specific config
options, discussed as per [2], we have deprecated the usage in other
places for v5.10-rc1. Drop the configuration for the follow on kernel.
