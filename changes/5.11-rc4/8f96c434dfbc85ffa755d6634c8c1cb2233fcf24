spi: spi-geni-qcom: Fix use-after-free on unbind

spi_geni_remove() accesses the driver's private data after calling
spi_unregister_master() even though that function releases the last
reference on the spi_master and thereby frees the private data.

Moreover, since commit 1a9e489e6128 ("spi: spi-geni-qcom: Use OPP API to
set clk/perf state"), spi_geni_probe() leaks the spi_master allocation
if the calls to dev_pm_opp_set_clkname() or dev_pm_opp_of_add_table()
fail.

Fix by switching over to the new devm_spi_alloc_master() helper which
keeps the private data accessible until the driver has unbound and also
avoids the spi_master leak on probe.
