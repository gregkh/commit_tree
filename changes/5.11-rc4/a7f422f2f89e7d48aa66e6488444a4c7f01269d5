bus: mhi: Fix channel close issue on driver remove

Some MHI device drivers need to stop the channels in their driver
remove callback (e.g. module unloading), but the unprepare function
is aborted because MHI core moved the channels to suspended state
prior calling driver remove callback. This prevents the driver to
send a proper MHI RESET CHAN command to the device. Device is then
unaware of the stopped state of these channels.

This causes issue when driver tries to start the channels again (e.g.
module is reloaded), since device considers channels as already
started (inconsistent state).

Fix this by allowing channel reset when channel is suspended.
