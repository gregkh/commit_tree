fpga: fpga-mgr: Add devm_fpga_mgr_register() API

Add a devm_fpga_mgr_register() API that can be used to register a FPGA
Manager that was created using devm_fpga_mgr_create().

Introduce a struct fpga_mgr_devres that makes the devres
allocation a little bit more readable and gets reused for
devm_fpga_mgr_create() devm_fpga_mgr_register().
