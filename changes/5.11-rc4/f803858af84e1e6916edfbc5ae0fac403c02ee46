clk: at91: sama7g5: decrease lower limit for MCK0 rate

On SAMA7G5 CPU clock is changed at run-time by DVFS. Since MCK0 and
CPU clock shares the same parent clock (CPUPLL clock) the MCK0 is
also changed by DVFS to avoid over/under clocking of MCK0 consumers.
The lower limit is changed to be able to set MCK0 accordingly by
DVFS.
