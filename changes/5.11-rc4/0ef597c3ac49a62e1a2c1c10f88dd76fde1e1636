docs: remove mention of ENABLE_MUST_CHECK

We removed ENABLE_MUST_CHECK in 196793946264 ("Compiler Attributes:
remove CONFIG_ENABLE_MUST_CHECK"), so let's remove docs' mentions.

At the same time, fix the outdated text related to
ENABLE_WARN_DEPRECATED that wasn't removed in 3337d5cfe5e08
("configs: get rid of obsolete CONFIG_ENABLE_WARN_DEPRECATED").

Finally, reflow the paragraph.
