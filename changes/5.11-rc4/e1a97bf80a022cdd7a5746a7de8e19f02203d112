usb: typec: tcpci: Implement Auto discharge disconnect callbacks

vImplement callbacks for enabling/disabling
POWER_CONTROL.AutoDischargeDisconnect.

Programs VBUS_SINK_DISCONNECT_THRESHOLD based on the
voltage requested as sink, mode of operation.

The programmed threshold is based on vSinkDisconnect and
vSinkDisconnectPD values.

Add auto_discharge_disconnect to tdata to allow TCPC chip
level drivers enable AutoDischargeDisconnect.
