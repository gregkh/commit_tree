libbpf: Add support for canceling cached_cons advance

Add a new function for returning descriptors the user received
after an xsk_ring_cons__peek call. After the application has
gotten a number of descriptors from a ring, it might not be able
to or want to process them all for various reasons. Therefore,
it would be useful to have an interface for returning or
cancelling a number of them so that they are returned to the ring.

This patch adds a new function called xsk_ring_cons__cancel that
performs this operation on nb descriptors counted from the end of
the batch of descriptors that was received through the peek call.
