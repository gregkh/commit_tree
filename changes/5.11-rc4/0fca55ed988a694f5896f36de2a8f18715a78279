net: sched: remove redundant 'rtnl_held' argument

Functions tfilter_notify_chain() and tcf_get_next_proto() are always called
with rtnl lock held in current implementation. Moreover, attempting to call
them without rtnl lock would cause a warning down the call chain in
function __tcf_get_next_proto() that requires the lock to be held by
callers. Remove the 'rtnl_held' argument in order to simplify the code and
make rtnl lock requirement explicit.
