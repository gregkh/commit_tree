zram: add stat to gather incompressible pages since zram set up

Currently, zram supports the stat via /sys/block/zram/mm_stat to represent
how many of incompressible pages are stored at the moment but it couldn't
show how many times incompressible pages were wrote down since zram set
up.  It's also good indication to see how zram is effective in the system.
