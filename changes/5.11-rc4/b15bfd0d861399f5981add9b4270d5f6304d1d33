drm/amd/display: Revert HUBP blank behaviour for now

[Why]
Commit "Blank HUBP during pixel data blank for DCN30 v2"
modifies HW behaviour during blank, which might have OS
dependencies. We need to assess the impact on amdgpu_dm
and only re-enable HUBP blanking when all necessary
changes are understood.

[How]
 - revert functional changes
 - leave architectural changes intact
