mtd: spi-nor: add spi_nor_controller_ops_{read_reg, write_reg, erase}()

They are thin wrappers around
nor->controller_ops->{read_reg,write_reg,erase}(). In a future commit
DTR support will be added. These ops can not be supported by the
controller_ops hooks and these helpers will make it easier to reject
those calls.
