drm/amd/display: Add HDR3DLUT and SHAPER memory shutdown support

[Why]
The HDR3DLUT and SHAPER memory blocks should be powered down when
they're not in use. This will reduce power consumption.

[How]
1. Write to HDR3DLUT_MEM_PWR_FORCE to put memory to shutdown
   when HDR3DLUT is not used.
2. Write to SHAPER_MEM_PWR_FORCE to put memory to shutdown
   when SHAPER is not used.
