btrfs: sink the failed_start parameter to set_extent_bit

The @failed_start parameter is only paired with @exclusive_bits, and
those parameters are only used for EXTENT_LOCKED bit, which have their
own wrappers lock_extent_bits().

Thus for regular set_extent_bit() calls, the failed_start makes no
sense, just sink the parameter.

Also, since @failed_start and @exclusive_bits are used in pairs, add
an assert to make it obvious.
