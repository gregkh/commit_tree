drm/i915/cnl: skip PW_DDI_F on certain skus

The skus guarded by IS_CNL_WITH_PORT_F() have port F and thus they need
those power wells. The others don't have those. Up to now we were
just overriding the number of power wells on !IS_CNL_WITH_PORT_F(),
relying on those power wells to be the last ones. Now that we have logic
in place to skip power wells by id, use it instead.
