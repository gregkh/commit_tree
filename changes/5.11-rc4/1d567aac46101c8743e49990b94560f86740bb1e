PCI: dwc/intel-gw: Move ATU offset out of driver match data

The ATU offset should be a register range in DT called 'atu', not driver
match data. Any future platforms with a different ATU offset should add
it to their DT.

This is also in preparation to do DBI resource setup in the core DWC
code, so let's move setting atu_base later in intel_pcie_rc_setup().
