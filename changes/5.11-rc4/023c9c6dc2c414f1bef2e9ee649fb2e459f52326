uio: uio_sercos3: use device-managed functions for simple allocs

This change converts the simple allocations [kzalloc()] to devm_kzalloc()
tying the life-time of these objects to the PCI device object.
It cleans up the error and exit path and bit, and does a minor correction
that -ENOMEM is returned (vs -ENODEV) in case the 'priv' object cannot be
allocated.
