dmaengine: idxd: add IAX configuration support in the IDXD driver

Add support to allow configuration of Intel Analytics Accelerator (IAX) in
addition to the Intel Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA). The IAX hardware
has the same configuration interface as DSA. The main difference
is the type of operations it performs. We can support the DSA and
IAX devices on the same driver with some tweaks.

IAX has a 64B completion record that needs to be 64B aligned, as opposed to
a 32B completion record that is 32B aligned for DSA. IAX also does not
support token management.
