io_uring: drop mm and files after task_work_run

__io_req_task_submit() run by task_work can set mm and files, but
io_sq_thread() in some cases, and because __io_sq_thread_acquire_mm()
and __io_sq_thread_acquire_files() do a simple current->mm/files check
it may end up submitting IO with mm/files of another task.

We also need to drop it after in the end to drop potentially grabbed
references to them.
