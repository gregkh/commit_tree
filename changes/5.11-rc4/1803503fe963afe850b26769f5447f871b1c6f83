ALSA: usb-audio: Set and clear sync EP link properly

The sync EP setup isn't cleared at stopping the stream but expected to
be cleared at the next stream start.  This may leave the sync link
setup stale and can spoof wrongly when full duplex streams were
running in the implicit fb sync.  Let's initialize them properly at
start and end of the stream.
