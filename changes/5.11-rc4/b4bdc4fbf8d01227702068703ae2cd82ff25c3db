soc: sunxi: Deal with the MBUS DMA offsets in a central place

So far most of the drivers with the MBUS quirks had to duplicate the
code to deal with DT compatibility and enforcing the DMA offsets.

Let's move for a more maintainable solution by putting everything in a
notifier that would take care of setting up the DMA offsets for all the
MBUS devices.
