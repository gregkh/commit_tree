drm/i915: Fix state checker hw.active/hw.enable readout

Previously intel_dump_pipe_config() used to dump the full crtc state
whether or not the crtc was logically enabled or not. As that meant
occasionally dumping confusing stale garbage I changed it to
check whether the crtc is logically enabled or not. However I did
not realize that the state checker readout code does not
populate crtc_state.hw.{active,enabled}. Hence the state checker
dump would only give us a full dump of the sw state but not the hw
state. Fix that by populating those bits of the hw state as well.
