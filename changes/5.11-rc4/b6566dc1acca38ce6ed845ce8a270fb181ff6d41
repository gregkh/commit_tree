RISC-V: Align the .init.text section

In order to improve kernel text protection, we need separate .init.text/
.init.data/.text in separate sections. However, RISC-V linker relaxation
code is not aware of any alignment between sections. As a result, it may
relax any RISCV_CALL relocations between sections to JAL without realizing
that an inter section alignment may move the address farther. That may
lead to a relocation truncated fit error. However, linker relaxation code
is aware of the individual section alignments.

The detailed discussion on this issue can be found here.

Keep the .init.text section aligned so that linker relaxation will take
that as a hint while relaxing inter section calls.
Here are the code size changes for each section because of this change.

section         change in size (in bytes)
  .head.text      +4
  .text           +40
  .init.text      +6530
  .exit.text      +84

The only significant increase in size happened for .init.text because
all intra relocations also use 2MB alignment.
