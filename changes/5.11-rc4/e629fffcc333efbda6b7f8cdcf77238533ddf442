dt-binding: watchdog: add Rockchip compatibles to snps,dw-wdt.yaml

The Rockchip watchdog compatibles below are already in use,
but somehow never added to a document,
so add them to the snps,dw-wdt.yaml file.

"rockchip,rk3066-wdt", "snps,dw-wdt"
"rockchip,rk3188-wdt", "snps,dw-wdt"
"rockchip,rk3288-wdt", "snps,dw-wdt"
"rockchip,rk3368-wdt", "snps,dw-wdt"

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/watchdog/snps,dw-wdt.yaml

make ARCH=arm64 dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/watchdog/snps,dw-wdt.yaml
