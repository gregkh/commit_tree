soc: qcom: initialize local variable

clang static analysis reports this problem

pdr_interface.c:596:6: warning: Branch condition evaluates
  to a garbage value
        if (!req.service_path[0])
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This check that req.service_path was set in an earlier loop.
However req is a stack variable and its initial value
is undefined.

So initialize req to 0.
