cxgb4/chtls: Fix tid stuck due to wrong update of qid

TID stuck is seen when there is a race in
CPL_PASS_ACCEPT_RPL/CPL_ABORT_REQ and abort is arriving
before the accept reply, which sets the queue number.
In this case HW ends up sending CPL_ABORT_RPL_RSS to an
incorrect ingress queue.

V1->V2:
- Removed the unused variable len in chtls_set_quiesce_ctrl().

V2->V3:
- As kfree_skb() has a check for null skb, so removed this
check before calling kfree_skb() in func chtls_send_reset().

Fixes: cc35c88ae4db ("crypto : chtls - CPL handler definition")
