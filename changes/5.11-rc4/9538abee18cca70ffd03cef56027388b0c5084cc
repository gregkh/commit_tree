powerpc/smp: Add support detecting thread-groups sharing L2 cache

On POWER systems, groups of threads within a core sharing the L2-cache
can be indicated by the "ibm,thread-groups" property array with the
identifier "2".

This patch adds support for detecting this, and when present, populate
the populating the cpu_l2_cache_mask of every CPU to the core-siblings
which share L2 with the CPU as specified in the by the
"ibm,thread-groups" property array.

On a platform with the following "ibm,thread-group" configuration
		 00000001 00000002 00000004 00000000
		 00000002 00000004 00000006 00000001
		 00000003 00000005 00000007 00000002
		 00000002 00000004 00000000 00000002
		 00000004 00000006 00000001 00000003
		 00000005 00000007

Without this patch, the sched-domain hierarchy for CPUs 0,1 would be
	CPU0 attaching sched-domain(s):
	domain-0: span=0,2,4,6 level=SMT
	domain-1: span=0-7 level=CACHE
	domain-2: span=0-15,24-39,48-55 level=MC
	domain-3: span=0-55 level=DIE

	CPU1 attaching sched-domain(s):
	domain-0: span=1,3,5,7 level=SMT
	domain-1: span=0-7 level=CACHE
	domain-2: span=0-15,24-39,48-55 level=MC
	domain-3: span=0-55 level=DIE

The CACHE domain at 0-7 is incorrect since the ibm,thread-groups
sub-array
[00000002 00000002 00000004
 00000000 00000002 00000004 00000006
 00000001 00000003 00000005 00000007]
indicates that L2 (Property "2") is shared only between the threads of a single
group. There are "2" groups of threads where each group contains "4"
threads each. The groups being {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}.

With this patch, the sched-domain hierarchy for CPUs 0,1 would be
     	CPU0 attaching sched-domain(s):
	domain-0: span=0,2,4,6 level=SMT
	domain-1: span=0-15,24-39,48-55 level=MC
	domain-2: span=0-55 level=DIE

	CPU1 attaching sched-domain(s):
	domain-0: span=1,3,5,7 level=SMT
	domain-1: span=0-15,24-39,48-55 level=MC
	domain-2: span=0-55 level=DIE

The CACHE domain with span=0,2,4,6 for CPU 0 (span=1,3,5,7 for CPU 1
resp.) gets degenerated into the SMT domain. Furthermore, the
last-level-cache domain gets correctly set to the SMT sched-domain.
