tty/serial/imx: Enable TXEN bit in imx_poll_init().

As described in Documentation, poll_init() is called by kgdb to initialize
hardware which supports both poll_put_char() and poll_get_char().

It's necessary to enable TXEN bit, otherwise, it will cause hardware fault
and kernel panic when calling imx_poll_put_char().

Generally, if use /dev/ttymxc0 as kgdb console as well as system
console, ttymxc0 is initialized early by system console which does enable
TXEN bit.But when use /dev/ttymxc1 as kgbd console, ttymxc1 is only
initialized by imx_poll_init() cannot enable the TXEN bit, which will
cause kernel panic.
