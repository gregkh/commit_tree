Input: omap4-keypad - fix runtime PM error handling

In omap4_keypad_probe, the patch fix several bugs.

  1) pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even it
     failed. Forgetting to pm_runtime_put_noidle will result in
     reference leak.

  2) In err_unmap, forget to disable runtime of device,
     pm_runtime_enable will increase power disable depth. Thus a
     pairing decrement is needed on the error handling path to keep
     it balanced.

  3) In err_pm_disable, it will call pm_runtime_put_sync twice not
     one time.

To fix this we factor out code reading revision and disabling touchpad, and
drop PM reference once we are done talking to the device.
