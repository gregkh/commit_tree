drm/amd/display: use FB pitch to fill dc_cursor_attributes

Instead of relying on pitch (in pixels) == width, use the FB pitch. This
is less confusing to readers, and works correctly if we ever support FBs
with a pitch (in pixels) != width.

This also makes the code symmetrical with fill_plane_buffer_attributes.
