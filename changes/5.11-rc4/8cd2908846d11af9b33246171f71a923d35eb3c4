btrfs: clear oneshot options on mount and remount

Some options only apply during mount time and are cleared at the end
of mount. For now, the example is USEBACKUPROOT, but CLEAR_CACHE also
fits the bill, and this is a preparation patch for also clearing that
option.

One subtlety is that the current code only resets USEBACKUPROOT on rw
mounts, but the option is meaningfully "consumed" by a ro mount, so it
feels appropriate to clear in that case as well. A subsequent read-write
remount would not go through open_ctree, which is the only place that
checks the option, so the change should be benign.
