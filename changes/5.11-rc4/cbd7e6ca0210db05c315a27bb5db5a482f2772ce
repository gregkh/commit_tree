powerpc/fault: Avoid heavy search_exception_tables() verification

search_exception_tables() is an heavy operation, we have to avoid it.
When KUAP is selected, we'll know the fault has been blocked by KUAP.
When it is blocked by KUAP, check whether we are in an expected
userspace access place. If so, emit a warning to spot something is
going work. Otherwise, just remain silent, it will likely Oops soon.

When KUAP is not selected, it behaves just as if the address was
already in the TLBs and no fault was generated.
