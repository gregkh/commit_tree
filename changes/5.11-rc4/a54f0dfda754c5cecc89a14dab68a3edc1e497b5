signal: define the SA_UNSUPPORTED bit in sa_flags

Define a sa_flags bit, SA_UNSUPPORTED, which will never be supported
in the uapi. The purpose of this flag bit is to allow userspace to
distinguish an old kernel that does not clear unknown sa_flags bits
from a kernel that supports every flag bit.

In other words, if userspace does something like:

  act.sa_flags |= SA_UNSUPPORTED;
  sigaction(SIGSEGV, &act, 0);
  sigaction(SIGSEGV, 0, &oldact);

and finds that SA_UNSUPPORTED remains set in oldact.sa_flags, it means
that the kernel cannot be trusted to have cleared unknown flag bits
from sa_flags, so no assumptions about flag bit support can be made.
