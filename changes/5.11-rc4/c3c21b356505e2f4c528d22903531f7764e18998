remoteproc: k3-r5: Adjust TCM sizes in Split-mode on J7200 SoCs

The J7200 SoCs have a revised R5FSS IP that adds a unique feature w.r.t
TCM sizing. Each R5F core in a cluster typically has 32 KB each of ATCM
and BTCM, with only the Core0 TCMs usable in LockStep mode. This revised
IP however doubles the total available TCM in LockStep mode by making the
Core1 TCM visible immediately after the corresponding Core0 TCM.

The R5F DT nodes on the J7200 SoCs define double (64 KB) the normal TCM
size (32 KB) for R5F Core0 for each of ATCM and BTCM to represent the
above. This increased TCM memory is only usable in LockStep-mode, and
has to be adjusted to the normal 32 KB size in Split mode. Enhance the
TI K3 R5F remoteproc for this logic through a new function. The adjustment
is a no-op on prior SoCs and relies on the correct DTS node sizes in
LockStep-mode on applicable SoCs.
