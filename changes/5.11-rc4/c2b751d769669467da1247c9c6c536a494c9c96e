ASoC: sun8i-codec: Enable all supported sample rates

The system sample rate programmed into the hardware is really a clock
divider from SYSCLK to the ADC and DAC. Since we support two SYSCLK
frequencies, we can use all sample rates corresponding to one of those
frequencies divided by any available divisor.

This commit enables support for those sample rates. It also stops
advertising support for a 64 kHz sample rate, which is not supported.
