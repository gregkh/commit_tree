srcu: Use a more appropriate lockdep helper

The lockdep_is_held() macro is defined as:

 #define lockdep_is_held(lock)		lock_is_held(&(lock)->dep_map)

This hides away the dereference, so that builds with !LOCKDEP don't break.
This works in current kernels because the RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN() eliminates
its condition at preprocessor time in !LOCKDEP kernels.  However, later
patches in this series will cause the compiler to see this condition even
in !LOCKDEP kernels.  This commit prepares for this upcoming change by
switching from lock_is_held() to lockdep_is_held().
