xen: Remove Xen PVH/PVHVM dependency on PCI

A Xen PVH domain doesn't have a PCI bus or devices, so it doesn't need
PCI support built in.  Currently, XEN_PVH depends on XEN_PVHVM which
depends on PCI.

Introduce XEN_PVHVM_GUEST as a toplevel item and change XEN_PVHVM to a
hidden variable.  This allows XEN_PVH to depend on XEN_PVHVM without PCI
while XEN_PVHVM_GUEST depends on PCI.

In drivers/xen, compile platform-pci depending on XEN_PVHVM_GUEST since
that pulls in the PCI dependency for linking.
