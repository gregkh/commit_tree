powerpc/vdso: Block R_PPC_REL24 relocations

Add R_PPC_REL24 relocations to the list of relocations we do NOT
support in the VDSO.

These are generated in some cases and we do not support relocating
them at runtime, so if they appear then the VDSO will not work at
runtime, therefore it's preferable to break the build if we see them.
