x86: vdso: Expose sigreturn address on vdso to the kernel

Syscall user redirection requires the signal trampoline code to not be
captured, in order to support returning with a locked selector while
avoiding recursion back into the signal handler.  For ia-32, which has
the trampoline in the vDSO, expose the entry points to the kernel, such
that it can avoid dispatching syscalls from that region to userspace.
