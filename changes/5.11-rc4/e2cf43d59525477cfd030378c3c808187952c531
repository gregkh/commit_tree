powerpc/xive: Introduce XIVE_IPI_HW_IRQ

The XIVE driver deals with CPU IPIs in a peculiar way. Each CPU has
its own XIVE IPI interrupt allocated at the HW level, for PowerNV, or
at the hypervisor level for pSeries. In practice, these interrupts are
not always used. pSeries/PowerVM prefers local doorbells for local
threads since they are faster. On PowerNV, global doorbells are also
preferred for the same reason.

The mapping in the Linux is reduced to a single interrupt using HW
interrupt number 0 and a custom irq_chip to handle EOI. This can cause
performance issues in some benchmark (ipistorm) on multichip systems.

Clarify the use of the 0 value, it will help in improving multichip
support.
