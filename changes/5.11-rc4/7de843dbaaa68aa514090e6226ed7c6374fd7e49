HID: logitech-hidpp: Add product ID for MX Ergo in Bluetooth mode

The Logitech MX Ergo trackball supports HID++ 4.5 over Bluetooth. Add its
product ID to the table so we can get battery monitoring support.
(The hid-logitech-hidpp driver already recognizes it when connected via
a Unifying Receiver.)
