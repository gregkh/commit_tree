net: x25: Remove unimplemented X.25-over-LLC code stubs

According to the X.25 documentation, there was a plan to implement
X.25-over-802.2-LLC. It never finished but left various code stubs in the
X.25 code. At this time it is unlikely that it would ever finish so it
may be better to remove those code stubs.

Also change the documentation to make it clear that this is not a ongoing
plan anymore. Change words like "will" to "could", "would", etc.
