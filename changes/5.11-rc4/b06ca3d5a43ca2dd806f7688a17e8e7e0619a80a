mlxsw: core: Increase critical threshold for ASIC thermal zone

Increase critical threshold for ASIC thermal zone from 110C to 140C
according to the system hardware requirements. All the supported ASICs
(Spectrum-1, Spectrum-2, Spectrum-3) could be still operational with ASIC
temperature below 140C. With the old critical threshold value system
can perform unjustified shutdown.

All the systems equipped with the above ASICs implement thermal
protection mechanism at firmware level and firmware could decide to
perform system thermal shutdown in case the temperature is below 140C.
So with the new threshold system will not meltdown, while thermal
operating range will be aligned with hardware abilities.
