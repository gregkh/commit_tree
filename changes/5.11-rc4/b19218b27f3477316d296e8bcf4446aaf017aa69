nexthop: Bounce NHA_GATEWAY in FDB nexthop groups

The function nh_check_attr_group() is called to validate nexthop groups.
The intention of that code seems to have been to bounce all attributes
above NHA_GROUP_TYPE except for NHA_FDB. However instead it bounces all
these attributes except when NHA_FDB attribute is present--then it accepts
them.

NHA_FDB validation that takes place before, in rtm_to_nh_config(), already
bounces NHA_OIF, NHA_BLACKHOLE, NHA_ENCAP and NHA_ENCAP_TYPE. Yet further
back, NHA_GROUPS and NHA_MASTER are bounced unconditionally.

But that still leaves NHA_GATEWAY as an attribute that would be accepted in
FDB nexthop groups (with no meaning), so long as it keeps the address
family as unspecified:

 # ip nexthop add id 1 fdb via 127.0.0.1
 # ip nexthop add id 10 fdb via default group 1

The nexthop code is still relatively new and likely not used very broadly,
and the FDB bits are newer still. Even though there is a reproducer out
there, it relies on an improbable gateway arguments "via default", "via
all" or "via any". Given all this, I believe it is OK to reformulate the
condition to do the right thing and bounce NHA_GATEWAY.
