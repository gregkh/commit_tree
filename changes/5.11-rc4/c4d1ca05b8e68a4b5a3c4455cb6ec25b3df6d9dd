xhci-pci: Allow host runtime PM as default for Intel Alpine Ridge LP

The xHCI controller on Alpine Ridge LP keeps the whole Thunderbolt
controller awake if the host controller is not allowed to sleep.
This is the case even if no USB devices are connected to the host.

Add the Intel Alpine Ridge LP product-id to the list of product-ids
for which we allow runtime PM by default.
