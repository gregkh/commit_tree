PCI/ACPI: Fix companion lookup for device 0 on the root bus

In some cases acpi_pci_find_companion() returns an incorrect device object
as the ACPI companion for device 0 on the root bus (bus 0).

On the affected systems that device is the PCI interface to the host bridge
and the "ACPI companion" returned for it corresponds to a non-PCI device
located in the SoC (e.g. a sensor on an I2C bus).  As a result of this, the
ACPI device object "attached" to PCI device 00:00.0 cannot be used for
enumerating the device that is really represented by it which (of course)
is problematic.

Address that issue by preventing acpi_pci_find_companion() from returning a
device object with a valid _HID (which by the spec should not be present
uder ACPI device objects corresponding to PCI devices) for PCI device
00:00.0.
