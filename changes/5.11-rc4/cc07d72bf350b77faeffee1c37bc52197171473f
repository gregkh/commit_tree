dm raid: fix discard limits for raid1

Block core warned that discard_granularity was 0 for dm-raid with
personality of raid1.  Reason is that raid_io_hints() was incorrectly
special-casing raid1 rather than raid0.

Fix raid_io_hints() by removing discard limits settings for
raid1. Check for raid0 instead.
