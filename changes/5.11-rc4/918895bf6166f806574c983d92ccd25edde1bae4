net: fddi: skfp: ecm: Protect 'if' when AIX_EVENT is not defined

When AIX_EVENT is not defined, the 'if' body will be empty, which
makes GCC complain.  Place bracketing around the invocation to protect
it.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/net/fddi/skfp/ecm.c: In function ‘ecm_fsm’:
 drivers/net/fddi/skfp/ecm.c:153:29: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
