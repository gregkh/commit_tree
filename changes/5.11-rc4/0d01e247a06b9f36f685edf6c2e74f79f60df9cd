btrfs: assert page mapping lock in attach_extent_buffer_page

When calling attach_extent_buffer_page(), either we're attaching
anonymous pages, called from btrfs_clone_extent_buffer(),
or we're attaching btree inode pages, called from alloc_extent_buffer().

For the latter case, we should hold page->mapping->private_lock to avoid
parallel changes to page->private.
