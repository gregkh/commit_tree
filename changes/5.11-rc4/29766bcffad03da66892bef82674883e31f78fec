net: support kmap_local forced debugging in skb_frag_foreach

Skb frags may be backed by highmem and/or compound pages. Highmem
pages need kmap_atomic mappings to access. But kmap_atomic maps a
single page, not the entire compound page.

skb_foreach_page iterates over an skb frag, in one step in the common
case, page by page only if kmap_atomic must be called for each page.
The decision logic is captured in skb_frag_must_loop.

CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP extends kmap from highmem to all
pages, to increase code coverage.

Extend skb_frag_must_loop to this new condition.
