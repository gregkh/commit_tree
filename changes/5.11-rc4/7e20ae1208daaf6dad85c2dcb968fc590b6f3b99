ASoC: q6afe-clocks: Add missing parent clock rate

setting clock rate on child clocks without a parent clock rate will
result in zero clk rate for child. This also means that when audio
is started dsp will attempt to access registers without enabling
clock resulting in board boot up.

Fix this by adding the missing parent clock rate.
