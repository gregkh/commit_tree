EDAC/igen6: Add EDAC driver for Intel client SoCs using IBECC

This driver supports Intel client SoC with integrated memory controller
using In-Band ECC(IBECC). The memory correctable and uncorrectable errors
are reported via NMIs. The driver handles the NMIs and decodes the memory
error address to platform specific address. The first IBECC-supported SoC
is Elkhart Lake.
