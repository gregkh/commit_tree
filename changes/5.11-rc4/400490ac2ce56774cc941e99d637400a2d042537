ipv6: mcast: make annotations for ip6_mc_msfget() consistent

Commit 931ca7ab7fe8 ("ip*_mc_gsfget(): lift copyout of struct group_filter
into callers") adjusted the type annotations for ip6_mc_msfget() at its
declaration, but missed the type annotations at its definition.

Hence, sparse complains on ./net/ipv6/mcast.c:

  mcast.c:550:5: error: symbol 'ip6_mc_msfget' redeclared with different type \
  (incompatible argument 3 (different address spaces))

Make ip6_mc_msfget() annotations consistent, which also resolves this
warning from sparse:

  mcast.c:607:34: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
  mcast.c:607:34:    expected void [noderef] __user *to
  mcast.c:607:34:    got struct __kernel_sockaddr_storage *p

No functional change. No change in object code.
