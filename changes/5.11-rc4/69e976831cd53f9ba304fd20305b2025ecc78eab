MIPS: relocatable: fix possible boot hangup with KASLR enabled

LLVM-built Linux triggered a boot hangup with KASLR enabled.

arch/mips/kernel/relocate.c:get_random_boot() uses linux_banner,
which is a string constant, as a random seed, but accesses it
as an array of unsigned long (in rotate_xor()).
When the address of linux_banner is not aligned to sizeof(long),
such access emits unaligned access exception and hangs the kernel.

Use PTR_ALIGN() to align input address to sizeof(long) and also
align down the input length to prevent possible access-beyond-end.
