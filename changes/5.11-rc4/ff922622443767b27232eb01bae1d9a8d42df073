ASoC: topology: Change allocations to resource managed

In order for topology to be resource managed, change all allocations to
be resource managed:
k*alloc -> devm_k*alloc
kstrdup -> devm_kstrdup

Exceptions where non resource managed allocation is left is
soc_tplg_dapm_widget_create(), as it uses pointer to memory locally and
frees it up after use, as well as soc_tplg_dapm_graph_elems_load(),
which has temporary pointer to table of routes.

After conversion all redundant calls in error and clean up paths were
removed.

Also removed some variables which become unneeded when there is no calls
using them.
