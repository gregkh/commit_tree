s390/qeth: reduce rtnl locking for switchdev events

call_switchdev_notifiers() doesn't require holding the RTNL lock since
commit ff5cf100110c ("net: switchdev: Change notifier chain to be atomic").

We still need it for the "lost event" slow path, to avoid racing against
a concurrent .ndo_bridge_setlink().
