scsi: aacraid: Improve compat_ioctl handlers

The use of compat_alloc_user_space() can be easily replaced by handling
compat arguments in the regular handler, and this will make it work for
big-endian kernels as well, which at the moment get an invalid indirect
pointer argument.

Calling aac_ioctl() instead of aac_compat_do_ioctl() means the compat and
native code paths behave the same way again, which they stopped when the
adapter health check was added only in the native function.
