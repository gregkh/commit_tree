USB: core: drop pipe-type check from new control-message helpers

The new control-message helpers include a pipe-type check which is
almost completely redundant.

Control messages are generally sent to the default pipe which always
exists and is of the correct type since its endpoint representation is
created by USB core as part of enumeration for all devices.

There is currently only one instance of a driver in the tree which use
a control endpoint other than endpoint 0 (and it does not use the new
helpers).

Drivers should be testing for the existence of their resources at probe
rather than at runtime, but to catch drivers failing to do so USB core
already does a sanity check on URB submission and triggers a WARN().
Having the same sanity check done in the helper only suppresses the
warning without allowing us to find and fix the drivers.
