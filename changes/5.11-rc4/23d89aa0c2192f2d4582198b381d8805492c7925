firmware: imx-dsp: Export functions to request/free channels

In order to save power, we only need to request a channel
when the communication with the DSP active.

For this we export the following functions:
	- imx_dsp_request_channel, gets a channel with a given index
	- imx_dsp_free_channel, frees a channel with a given index

Notice that we still request channels at probe to support devices
that do not have PM callbacks implemented.

More explanations about why requesting a channel has an effect
on power savings:
 - requesting an mailbox channel will call mailbox's startup
   function.
 - startup function calls pm_runtime_get_sync which increments device
   usage count and will keep the device active. Specifically, mailbox
   clock will be always ON when a mailbox channel is requested.
