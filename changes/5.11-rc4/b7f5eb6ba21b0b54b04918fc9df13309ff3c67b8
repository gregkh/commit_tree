net: qualcomm: rmnet: Update rmnet device MTU based on real device

Packets sent by rmnet to the real device have variable MAP header
lengths based on the data format configured. This patch adds checks
to ensure that the real device MTU is sufficient to transmit the MAP
packet comprising of the MAP header and the IP packet. This check
is enforced when rmnet devices are created and updated and during
MTU updates of both the rmnet and real device.

Additionally, rmnet devices now have a default MTU configured which
accounts for the real device MTU and the headroom based on the data
format.
