sched: membarrier: cover kthread_use_mm (v4)

Add comments and memory barrier to kthread_use_mm and kthread_unuse_mm
to allow the effect of membarrier(2) to apply to kthreads accessing
user-space memory as well.

Given that no prior kthread use this guarantee and that it only affects
kthreads, adding this guarantee does not affect user-space ABI.

Refine the check in membarrier_global_expedited to exclude runqueues
running the idle thread rather than all kthreads from the IPI cpumask.

Now that membarrier_global_expedited can IPI kthreads, the scheduler
also needs to update the runqueue's membarrier_state when entering lazy
TLB state.
