console: Delete unused con_font_copy() callback implementations

Recently in commit 3c4e0dff2095 ("vt: Disable KD_FONT_OP_COPY") we
disabled the KD_FONT_OP_COPY ioctl() option. Delete all the
con_font_copy() callbacks, since we no longer use them.

Mark KD_FONT_OP_COPY as "obsolete" in include/uapi/linux/kd.h, just like
what we have done for PPPIOCDETACH in commit af8d3c7c001a ("ppp: remove
the PPPIOCDETACH ioctl").
