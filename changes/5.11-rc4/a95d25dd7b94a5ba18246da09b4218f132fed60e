rxrpc: Call state should be read with READ_ONCE() under some circumstances

The call state may be changed at any time by the data-ready routine in
response to received packets, so if the call state is to be read and acted
upon several times in a function, READ_ONCE() must be used unless the call
state lock is held.

As it happens, we used READ_ONCE() to read the state a few lines above the
unmarked read in rxrpc_input_data(), so use that value rather than
re-reading it.
