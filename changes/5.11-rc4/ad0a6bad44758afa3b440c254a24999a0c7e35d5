x86/hyperv: check cpu mask after interrupt has been disabled

We've observed crashes due to an empty cpu mask in
hyperv_flush_tlb_others.  Obviously the cpu mask in question is changed
between the cpumask_empty call at the beginning of the function and when
it is actually used later.

One theory is that an interrupt comes in between and a code path ends up
changing the mask. Move the check after interrupt has been disabled to
see if it fixes the issue.
