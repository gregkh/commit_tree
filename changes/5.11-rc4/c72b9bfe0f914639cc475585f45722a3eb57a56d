ALSA: hda/realtek: make bass spk volume adjustable on a yoga laptop

This change could fix 2 issues on this machine:
 - the bass speaker's output volume can't be adjusted, that is because
   the bass speaker is routed to the DAC (Nid 0x6) which has no volume
   control.
 - after plugging a headset with vol+, vol- and pause buttons on it,
   press those buttons, nothing happens, this means those buttons
   don't work at all. This machine has alc287 codec, need to add the
   codec id to the disable/enable_headset_jack_key(), then the headset
   button could work.

The quirk of ALC285_FIXUP_THINKPAD_HEADSET_JACK could fix both of these
2 issues.
