kbuild: do not use scripts/ld-version.sh for checking spatch version

scripts/ld-version.sh was, as its file name implies, originally intended
for the GNU ld version, but is (ab)used for the spatch version too.

Use 'sort -CV' for the version comparison, then coccicheck does not need
to use scripts/ld-version.sh. Fix nsdeps as well.
