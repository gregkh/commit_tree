net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Unforce speed & duplex in mac_link_down()

Commit 64d47d50be7a ("net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: configure interface settings
in mac_config") removed forcing of speed and duplex from
mv88e6xxx_mac_config(), where the link is forced down, and left it only
in mv88e6xxx_mac_link_up(), by which time link is unforced.

It seems that (at least on 88E6190) when changing cmode to 2500base-x,
if the link is not forced down, but the speed or duplex are still
forced, the forcing of new settings for speed & duplex doesn't take in
mv88e6xxx_mac_link_up().

Fix this by unforcing speed & duplex in mv88e6xxx_mac_link_down().
