recordmcount.pl: look for jgnop instruction as well as bcrl on s390

On s390, recordmcount.pl is looking for "bcrl 0,<xxx>" instructions in
the objdump -d outpout. However since binutils 2.37, objdump -d
display "jgnop <xxx>" for the same instruction. Update the
mcount_regex so that it accepts both.
