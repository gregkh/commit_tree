btrfs: fix missing blkdev_put() call in btrfs_scan_one_device()

The function btrfs_scan_one_device() calls blkdev_get_by_path() and
blkdev_put() to get and release its target block device. However, when
btrfs_sb_log_location_bdev() fails, blkdev_put() is not called and the
block device is left without clean up. This triggered failure of fstests
generic/085. Fix the failure path of btrfs_sb_log_location_bdev() to
call blkdev_put().
