netdevsim: don't overwrite read only ethtool parms

Ethtool ring feature has _max_pending attributes read-only.
Set only read-write attributes in nsim_set_ringparam.

This patch is useful, if netdevsim device is set-up using NetworkManager,
because NetworkManager sends 0 as MAX values, as it is pointless to
retrieve them in extra call, because they should be read-only. Then,
the device is left in incosistent state (value > MAX).
