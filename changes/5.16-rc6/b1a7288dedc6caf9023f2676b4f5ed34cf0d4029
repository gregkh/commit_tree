bpf, selftests: Add test case trying to taint map value pointer

Add a test case which tries to taint map value pointer arithmetic into a
unknown scalar with subsequent export through the map.

Before fix:

  # ./test_verifier 1186
  #1186/u map access: trying to leak tained dst reg FAIL
  Unexpected success to load!
  verification time 24 usec
  stack depth 8
  processed 15 insns (limit 1000000) max_states_per_insn 0 total_states 1 peak_states 1 mark_read 1
  #1186/p map access: trying to leak tained dst reg FAIL
  Unexpected success to load!
  verification time 8 usec
  stack depth 8
  processed 15 insns (limit 1000000) max_states_per_insn 0 total_states 1 peak_states 1 mark_read 1
  Summary: 0 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 2 FAILED

After fix:

  # ./test_verifier 1186
  #1186/u map access: trying to leak tained dst reg OK
  #1186/p map access: trying to leak tained dst reg OK
  Summary: 2 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED
