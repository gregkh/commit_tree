Revert "drm/fb-helper: improve DRM fbdev emulation device names"

This reverts commit b3484d2b03e4c940a9598aa841a52d69729c582a.

That change attempted to improve the DRM drivers fbdev emulation device
names to avoid having confusing names like "simpledrmdrmfb" in /proc/fb.

But unfortunately, there are user-space programs such as pm-utils that
match against the fbdev names and so broke after the mentioned commit.

Since the names in /proc/fb are used by tools that consider it an uAPI,
let's restore the old names even when this lead to silly names like the
one mentioned above.
