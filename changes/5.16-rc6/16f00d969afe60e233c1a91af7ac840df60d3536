usb: cdnsp: Fix incorrect calling of cdnsp_died function

Patch restrict calling of cdnsp_died function during removing modules
or software disconnect.
This function was called because after transition controller to HALT
state the driver starts handling the deferred interrupt.
In this case such interrupt can be simple ignored.
