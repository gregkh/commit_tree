selftests: net: Correct ping6 expected rc from 2 to 1

./fcnal-test.sh -v -t ipv6_ping
TEST: ping out, VRF bind - ns-B IPv6 LLA                                      [FAIL]
TEST: ping out, VRF bind - multicast IP                                       [FAIL]

ping6 is failing as it should.
COMMAND: ip netns exec ns-A /bin/ping6 -c1 -w1 fe80::7c4c:bcff:fe66:a63a%red
strace of ping6 shows it is failing with '1',
so change the expected rc from 2 to 1.
