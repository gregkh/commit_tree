vdpa: check that offsets are within bounds

In this function "c->off" is a u32 and "size" is a long.  On 64bit systems
if "c->off" is greater than "size" then "size - c->off" is a negative and
we always return -E2BIG.  But on 32bit systems the subtraction is type
promoted to a high positive u32 value and basically any "c->len" is
accepted.
