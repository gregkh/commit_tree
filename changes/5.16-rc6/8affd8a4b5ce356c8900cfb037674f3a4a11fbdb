dmaengine: idxd: fix missed completion on abort path

Ming reported that with the abort path of the descriptor submission, there
can be a window where a completed descriptor can be missed to be completed
by the irq completion thread:

CPU A				CPU B
Submit (successful)

Submit (fail)
				irq_process_work_list() // empty

llist_abort_desc()
// remove all descs from pending list

				irq_process_pending_llist() // empty
				exit idxd_wq_thread() with no processing

Add opportunistic descriptor completion in the abort path in order to
remove the missed completion.
