PCI/MSI: Mask MSI-X vectors only on success

Masking all unused MSI-X entries is done to ensure that a crash kernel
starts from a clean slate, which correponds to the reset state of the
device as defined in the PCI-E specificion 3.0 and later:

 Vector Control for MSI-X Table Entries
 --------------------------------------

 "00: Mask bit:  When this bit is set, the function is prohibited from
                 sending a message using this MSI-X Table entry.
                 ...
                 This bitâ€™s state after reset is 1 (entry is masked)."

A Marvell NVME device fails to deliver MSI interrupts after trying to
enable MSI-X interrupts due to that masking. It seems to take the MSI-X
mask bits into account even when MSI-X is disabled.

While not specification compliant, this can be cured by moving the masking
into the success path, so that the MSI-X table entries stay in device reset
state when the MSI-X setup fails.

[ tglx: Move it into the success path, add comment and amend changelog ]
