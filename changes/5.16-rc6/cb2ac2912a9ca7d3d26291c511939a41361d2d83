block: reduce kblockd_mod_delayed_work_on() CPU consumption

Dexuan reports that he's seeing spikes of very heavy CPU utilization when
running 24 disks and using the 'none' scheduler. This happens off the
sched restart path, because SCSI requires the queue to be restarted async,
and hence we're hammering on mod_delayed_work_on() to ensure that the work
item gets run appropriately.

Avoid hammering on the timer and just use queue_work_on() if no delay
has been specified.
