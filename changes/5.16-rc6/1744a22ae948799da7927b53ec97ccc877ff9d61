afs: Fix mmap

Fix afs_add_open_map() to check that the vnode isn't already on the list
when it adds it.  It's possible that afs_drop_open_mmap() decremented
the cb_nr_mmap counter, but hadn't yet got into the locked section to
remove it.

Also vnode->cb_mmap_link should be initialised, so fix that too.
