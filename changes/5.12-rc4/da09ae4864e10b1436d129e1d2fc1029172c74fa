scsi: lpfc: Fix error log messages being logged following SCSI task mgnt

A successful task mgmt command is logging errors, making it look like
problems were encountered.  This is due to log messages for the
device/target and bus reset handlers having the LOG_TRACE_EVENT flag set.

Fix by adjusting the event flag such that the call to the logging routine
only receives a LOG_TRACE_EVENT if a prior call actually failed.
