mm/compaction: fix misbehaviors of fast_find_migrateblock()

In the fast_find_migrateblock(), it iterates ocer the freelist to find the
proper pageblock.  But there are some misbehaviors.

First, if the page we found is equal to cc->migrate_pfn, it is considered
that we didn't find a suitable pageblock.  Secondly, if the loop was
terminated because order is less than PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER, it could be
considered that we found a suitable one.  Thirdly, if the skip bit is set
on the page block and we goto continue, it doesn't check nr_scanned.
Fourthly, if the page block's skip bit is set, it checks that page block
is the last of list, which is unnecessary.
