KVM: x86/mmu: Fix RCU usage in handle_removed_tdp_mmu_page

The pt passed into handle_removed_tdp_mmu_page does not need RCU
protection, as it is not at any risk of being freed by another thread at
that point. However, the implicit cast from tdp_sptep_t to u64 * dropped
the __rcu annotation without a proper rcu_derefrence. Fix this by
passing the pt as a tdp_ptep_t and then rcu_dereferencing it in
the function.
