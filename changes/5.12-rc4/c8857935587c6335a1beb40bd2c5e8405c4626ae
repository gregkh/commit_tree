KVM: arm64: Refactor filtering of ID registers

Our current ID register filtering is starting to be a mess of if()
statements, and isn't going to get any saner.

Let's turn it into a switch(), which has a chance of being more
readable, and introduce a FEATURE() macro that allows easy generation
of feature masks.

No functionnal change intended.
