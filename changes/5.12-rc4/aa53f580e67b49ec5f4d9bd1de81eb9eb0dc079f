scsi: ufs: Minor adjustments to error handling

In error handling prepare stage, after SCSI requests are blocked, do a
down/up_write(clk_scaling_lock) to clean up the queuecommand() path.
Meanwhile, stop eeh_work in case it disturbs error recovery. Moreover,
reset ufshcd_state at the entrance of ufshcd_probe_hba(), since it may be
called multiple times during error recovery.
