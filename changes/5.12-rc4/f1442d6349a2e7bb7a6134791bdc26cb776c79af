sunrpc: fix refcount leak for rpc auth modules

If an auth module's accept op returns SVC_CLOSE, svc_process_common()
enters a call path that does not call svc_authorise() before leaving the
function, and thus leaks a reference on the auth module's refcount. Hence,
make sure calls to svc_authenticate() and svc_authorise() are paired for
all call paths, to make sure rpc auth modules can be unloaded.
