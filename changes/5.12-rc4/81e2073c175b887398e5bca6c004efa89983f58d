genirq: Disable interrupts for force threaded handlers

With interrupt force threading all device interrupt handlers are invoked
from kernel threads. Contrary to hard interrupt context the invocation only
disables bottom halfs, but not interrupts. This was an oversight back then
because any code like this will have an issue:

thread(irq_A)
  irq_handler(A)
    spin_lock(&foo->lock);

interrupt(irq_B)
  irq_handler(B)
    spin_lock(&foo->lock);

This has been triggered with networking (NAPI vs. hrtimers) and console
drivers where printk() happens from an interrupt which interrupted the
force threaded handler.

Now people noticed and started to change the spin_lock() in the handler to
spin_lock_irqsave() which affects performance or add IRQF_NOTHREAD to the
interrupt request which in turn breaks RT.

Fix the root cause and not the symptom and disable interrupts before
invoking the force threaded handler which preserves the regular semantics
and the usefulness of the interrupt force threading as a general debugging
tool.

For not RT this is not changing much, except that during the execution of
the threaded handler interrupts are delayed until the handler
returns. Vs. scheduling and softirq processing there is no difference.

For RT kernels there is no issue.
