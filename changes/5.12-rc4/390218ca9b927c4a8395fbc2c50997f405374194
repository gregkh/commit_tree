drm/i915: Rename pwm_* backlight callbacks to ext_pwm_*

Since we're going to need to add a set of lower-level PWM backlight
control hooks to be shared by normal backlight controls and HDR
backlight controls in SDR mode, let's add a prefix to the external PWM
backlight functions so that the difference between them and the high
level PWM-only backlight functions is a bit more obvious.

This introduces no functional changes.
