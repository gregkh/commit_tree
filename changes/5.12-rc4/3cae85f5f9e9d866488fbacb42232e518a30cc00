Documentation/admin-guide: kernel-parameters: Update nohlt section

Update the documentation regarding "nohlt" and indicate that it is not
only for bugs, but can be useful to disable the architecture specific
sleep instructions. ARM, ARM64, SuperH and Microblaze all use
CONFIG_GENERIC_IDLE_POLL_SETUP which takes care of honoring the
"hlt"/"nohlt" parameters.
