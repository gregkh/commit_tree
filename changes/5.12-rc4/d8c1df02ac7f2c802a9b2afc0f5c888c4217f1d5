iommu: Move iotlb_sync_map out from __iommu_map

In the end of __iommu_map, It alway call iotlb_sync_map.

This patch moves iotlb_sync_map out from __iommu_map since it is
unnecessary to call this for each sg segment especially iotlb_sync_map
is flush tlb all currently. Add a little helper _iommu_map for this.
