mt76: mt7921: remove incorrect error handling

Clang points out a mistake in the error handling in
mt7921_mcu_tx_rate_report(), which tries to dereference a pointer that
cannot be initialized because of the error that is being handled:

drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7921/mcu.c:409:3: warning: variable 'stats' is uninitialized when used here [-Wuninitialized]
                stats->tx_rate = rate;
                ^~~~~
drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7921/mcu.c:401:32: note: initialize the variable 'stats' to silence this warning
        struct mt7921_sta_stats *stats;
                                      ^
Just remove the obviously incorrect line.
