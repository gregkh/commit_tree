block: set .bi_max_vecs as actual allocated vector number

bvec_alloc() may allocate more bio vectors than requested, so set
.bi_max_vecs as actual allocated vector number, instead of the requested
number. This way can help fs build bigger bio because new bio often won't
be allocated until the current one becomes full.
