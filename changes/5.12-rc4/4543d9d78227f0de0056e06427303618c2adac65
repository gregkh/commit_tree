scsi: ufs: Refactor ufshcd_init/exit_clk_scaling/gating()

ufshcd_hba_exit() is always called after ufshcd_exit_clk_scaling() and
ufshcd_exit_clk_gating(). Move ufshcd_exit_clk_scaling/gating() to
ufshcd_hba_exit(). Meanwhile, add dedicated functions to initialize
and remove sysfs nodes of clock scaling/gating to make the code more
readable. Overall functionality remains same.
