proc: don't allow async path resolution of /proc/thread-self components

If this is attempted by an io-wq kthread, then return -EOPNOTSUPP as we
don't currently support that. Once we can get task_pid_ptr() doing the
right thing, then this can go away again.

Use PF_IO_WORKER for this to speciically target the io_uring workers.
Modify the /proc/self/ check to use PF_IO_WORKER as well.
