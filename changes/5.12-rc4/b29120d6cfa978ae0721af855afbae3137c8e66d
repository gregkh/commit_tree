arm64: dts: renesas: beacon kit: Fix Audio Clock sources

The SoC was expecting two clock sources with different frequencies.
One to support 44.1KHz and one to support 48KHz.  With the newly added
ability to configure the programmable clock, configure both clocks.

Assign the rcar-sound clocks to reference the versaclock instead of
the fixed clock.
