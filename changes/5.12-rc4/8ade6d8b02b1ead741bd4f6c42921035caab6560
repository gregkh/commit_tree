ASoC: Intel: Add DMI quirk table to soc_intel_is_byt_cr()

Some Bay Trail systems:
1. Use a non CR version of the Bay Trail SoC
2. Contain at least 6 interrupt resources so that the
   platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_IRQ, 5) check to workaround
   non CR systems which list their IPC IRQ at index 0 despite being
   non CR does not work
3. Despite 1. and 2. still have their IPC IRQ at index 0 rather then 5

Add a DMI quirk table to check for the few known models with this issue,
so that the right IPC IRQ index is used on these systems.
