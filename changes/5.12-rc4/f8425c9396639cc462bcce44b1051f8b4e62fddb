fuse: 32-bit user space ioctl compat for fuse device

With a 64-bit kernel build the FUSE device cannot handle ioctl requests
coming from 32-bit user space.  This is due to the ioctl command
translation that generates different command identifiers that thus cannot
be used for direct comparisons without proper manipulation.

Explicitly extract type and number from the ioctl command to enable 32-bit
user space compatibility on 64-bit kernel builds.
