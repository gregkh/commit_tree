devfreq: tegra30: Migrate to dev_pm_opp_set_opp()

dev_pm_opp_set_bw() is getting removed and dev_pm_opp_set_opp() should
be used instead. Migrate to the new API.

We don't want the OPP core to manage the clk for this driver, migrate to
dev_pm_opp_of_add_table_noclk() to make sure dev_pm_opp_set_opp()
doesn't have any side effects.
