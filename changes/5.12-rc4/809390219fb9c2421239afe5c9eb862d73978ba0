gpiolib: acpi: Allow to find GpioInt() resource by name and index

Currently only search by index is supported. However, in some cases
we might need to pass the quirks to the acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get().

For this, split out acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by() and replace
acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get() by calling above with NULL for name parameter.

Depends-on: 0ea683931adb ("gpio: dwapb: Convert driver to using the GPIO-lib-based IRQ-chip")
