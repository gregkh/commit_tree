Copyrights are generally followed by the name of a person or a
company (i.e. the copyright holder) but that was not done here.
Fix this by squashing the 'copyright' and 'author' lines.

Also, trim some leading whitespace ahead of the parameters for
the fw_file_store() function and re-align them for readability.
