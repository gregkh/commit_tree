counter: stm32-timer-cnt: fix ceiling miss-alignment with reload register

Ceiling value may be miss-aligned with what's actually configured into the
ARR register. This is seen after probe as currently the ARR value is zero,
whereas ceiling value is set to the maximum. So:
- reading ceiling reports zero
- in case the counter gets enabled without any prior configuration,
  it won't count.
- in case the function gets set by the user 1st, (priv->ceiling) is used.

Fix it by getting rid of the cached "priv->ceiling" variable. Rather use
the ARR register value directly by using regmap read or write when needed.
There should be no drawback on performance as priv->ceiling isn't used in
performance critical path.
There's also no point in writing ARR while setting function (sms), so
it can be safely removed.
