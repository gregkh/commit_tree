iommu/tegra-smmu: Make tegra_smmu_probe_device() to handle all IOMMU phandles

The tegra_smmu_probe_device() handles only the first IOMMU device-tree
phandle, skipping the rest. Devices like 3D module on Tegra30 have
multiple IOMMU phandles, one for each h/w block, and thus, only one
IOMMU phandle is added to fwspec for the 3D module, breaking GPU.
Previously this problem was masked by tegra_smmu_attach_dev() which
didn't use the fwspec, but parsed the DT by itself. The previous commit
to tegra-smmu driver partially reverted changes that caused problems for
T124 and now we have tegra_smmu_attach_dev() that uses the fwspec and
the old-buggy variant of tegra_smmu_probe_device() which skips secondary
IOMMUs.

Make tegra_smmu_probe_device() not to skip the secondary IOMMUs. This
fixes a partially attached IOMMU of the 3D module on Tegra30 and now GPU
works properly once again.
