drm/i915/gt: Track the overall awake/busy time

Since we wake the GT up before executing a request, and go to sleep as
soon as it is retired, the GT wake time not only represents how long the
device is powered up, but also provides a summary, albeit an overestimate,
of the device runtime (i.e. the rc0 time to compare against rc6 time).

v3: software-gt-awake-time and I915_PMU_SOFTWARE_GT_AWAKE_TIME
