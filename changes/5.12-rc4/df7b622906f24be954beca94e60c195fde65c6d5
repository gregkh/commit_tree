HID: google: Get HID report on probe to confirm tablet switch state

This forces reading the base folded state anytime the device is
probed, to make sure it's in sync.

This is useful after a reboot, if the device re-enumerates for
any reason (e.g. ESD shock), or if the driver is unbound/rebound
(debugging/testing).

Without this, the tablet switch state is only synchronized after a
key is pressed (since the device would then send a report that
includes the switch state), leading to strange UX (e.g. UI
mode changes when a key is pressed after reboot).

This is not a problem on detachable base attach, as the device,
by itself, sends a report after it is booted up.
