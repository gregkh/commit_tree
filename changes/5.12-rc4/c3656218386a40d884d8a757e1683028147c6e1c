clk: qcom: gcc-sdm660: Mark GPU CFG AHB clock as critical

This clock is critical for any access to the GPU: gating it will
crash the system when the GPU has been initialized (so, you cannot
gate it unless you deinit the Adreno completely).

So, to achieve a working state with GPU on, set the CLK_IS_CRITICAL
flag to this clock.
