drm/i915/gt: Don't cancel the interrupt shadow too early

We currently want to keep the interrupt enabled until the interrupt after
which we have no more work to do. This heuristic was broken by us
kicking the irq-work on adding a completed request without attaching a
signaler -- hence it appearing to the irq-worker that an interrupt had
fired when we were idle.
