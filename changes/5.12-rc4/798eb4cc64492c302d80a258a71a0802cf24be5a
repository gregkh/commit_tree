docs: Update DTB format references

There were two references to devicetree/booting-without-of.rst (which has
been removed) for DTB format information, and
devicetree/usage-model.rst pointed to
https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Usage. Change all three of these references to
https://www.devicetree.org/specifications/.
