arm64: Allow ID_AA64MMFR1_EL1.VH to be overridden from the command line

As we want to be able to disable VHE at runtime, let's match
"id_aa64mmfr1.vh=" from the command line as an override.
This doesn't have much effect yet as our boot code doesn't look
at the cpufeature, but only at the HW registers.
