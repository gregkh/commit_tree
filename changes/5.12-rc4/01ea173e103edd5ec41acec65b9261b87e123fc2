xfs: fix up non-directory creation in SGID directories

XFS always inherits the SGID bit if it is set on the parent inode, while
the generic inode_init_owner does not do this in a few cases where it can
create a possible security problem, see commit 0fa3ecd87848
("Fix up non-directory creation in SGID directories") for details.

Switch XFS to use the generic helper for the normal path to fix this,
just keeping the simple field inheritance open coded for the case of the
non-sgid case with the bsdgrpid mount option.
