bpf: Split cgroup_bpf_enabled per attach type

When we attach any cgroup hook, the rest (even if unused/unattached) start
to contribute small overhead. In particular, the one we want to avoid is
__cgroup_bpf_run_filter_skb which does two redirections to get to
the cgroup and pushes/pulls skb.

Let's split cgroup_bpf_enabled to be per-attach to make sure
only used attach types trigger.

I've dropped some existing high-level cgroup_bpf_enabled in some
places because BPF_PROG_CGROUP_XXX_RUN macros usually have another
cgroup_bpf_enabled check.

I also had to copy-paste BPF_CGROUP_RUN_SA_PROG_LOCK for
GETPEERNAME/GETSOCKNAME because type for cgroup_bpf_enabled[type]
has to be constant and known at compile time.
