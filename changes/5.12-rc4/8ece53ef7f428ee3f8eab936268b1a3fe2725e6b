x86/vm86/32: Remove VM86_SCREEN_BITMAP support

The implementation was rather buggy.  It unconditionally marked PTEs
read-only, even for VM_SHARED mappings.  I'm not sure whether this is
actually a problem, but it certainly seems unwise.  More importantly, it
released the mmap lock before flushing the TLB, which could allow a racing
CoW operation to falsely believe that the underlying memory was not
writable.

I can't find any users at all of this mechanism, so just remove it.
