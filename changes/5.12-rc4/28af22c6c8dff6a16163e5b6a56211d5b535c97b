net: adjust net_device layout for cacheline usage

The current layout of net_device is not optimal for cacheline usage.

The member adj_list.lower linked list is split between cacheline 2 and 3.
The ifindex is placed together with stats (struct net_device_stats),
although most modern drivers don't update this stats member.

The members netdev_ops, mtu and hard_header_len are placed on three
different cachelines. These members are accessed for XDP redirect into
devmap, which were noticeably with perf tool. When not using the map
redirect variant (like TC-BPF does), then ifindex is also used, which is
placed on a separate fourth cacheline. These members are also accessed
during forwarding with regular network stack. The members priv_flags and
flags are on fast-path for network stack transmit path in __dev_queue_xmit
(currently located together with mtu cacheline).

This patch creates a read mostly cacheline, with the purpose of keeping the
above mentioned members on the same cacheline.

Some netdev_features_t members also becomes part of this cacheline, which is
on purpose, as function netif_skb_features() is on fast-path via
validate_xmit_skb().
