exec: handle idmapped mounts

When executing a setuid binary the kernel will verify in bprm_fill_uid()
that the inode has a mapping in the caller's user namespace before
setting the callers uid and gid. Let bprm_fill_uid() handle idmapped
mounts. If the inode is accessed through an idmapped mount it is mapped
according to the mount's user namespace. Afterwards the checks are
identical to non-idmapped mounts. If the initial user namespace is
passed nothing changes so non-idmapped mounts will see identical
behavior as before.
