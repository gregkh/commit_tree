usb: typec: Standardize PD Revision format with Type-C Revision

The Type-C Revision was in a specific BCD format "0120H" for 1.2.
USB PD revision numbers follow a similar pattern with "0300H" for 3.0.

Standardizes the sysfs format for usb_power_delivery_revision
to align with the BCD format used for usb_typec_revision.

Example values:
- "2.0": USB Power Delivery Release 2.0
- "3.0": USB Power Delivery Release 3.0
- "3.1": USB Power Delivery Release 3.1
