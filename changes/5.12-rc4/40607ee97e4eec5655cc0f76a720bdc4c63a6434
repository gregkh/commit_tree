preempt/dynamic: Provide irqentry_exit_cond_resched() static call

Provide static call to control IRQ preemption (called in CONFIG_PREEMPT)
so that we can override its behaviour when preempt= is overriden.

Since the default behaviour is full preemption, its call is
initialized to provide IRQ preemption when preempt= isn't passed.
