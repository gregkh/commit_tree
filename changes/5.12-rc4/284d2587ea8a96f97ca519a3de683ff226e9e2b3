libbpf: Support kernel module ksym externs

Add support for searching for ksym externs not just in vmlinux BTF, but across
all module BTFs, similarly to how it's done for CO-RE relocations. Kernels
that expose module BTFs through sysfs are assumed to support new ldimm64
instruction extension with BTF FD provided in insn[1].imm field, so no extra
feature detection is performed.
