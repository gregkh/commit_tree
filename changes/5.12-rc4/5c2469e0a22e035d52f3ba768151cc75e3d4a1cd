io_uring: force creation of separate context for ATTACH_WQ and non-threads

Earlier kernels had SQPOLL threads that could share across anything, as
we grabbed the context we needed on a per-ring basis. This is no longer
the case, so only allow attaching directly if we're in the same thread
group. That is the common use case. For non-group tasks, just setup a
new context and thread as we would've done if sharing wasn't set. This
isn't 100% ideal in terms of CPU utilization for the forked and share
case, but hopefully that isn't much of a concern. If it is, there are
plans in motion for how to improve that. Most importantly, we want to
avoid app side regressions where sharing worked before and now doesn't.
With this patch, functionality is equivalent to previous kernels that
supported IORING_SETUP_ATTACH_WQ with SQPOLL.
