memory: tegra: Check whether reset is already asserted

Check whether memory client reset is already asserted in order to prevent
DMA-flush error on trying to re-assert an already asserted reset.

This becomes a problem once PMC GENPD is enabled to use memory resets
since GENPD will get a error and fail to toggle power domain. PMC GENPDs
can't be toggled safely without holding memory reset on Tegra and we're
about to fix this.
