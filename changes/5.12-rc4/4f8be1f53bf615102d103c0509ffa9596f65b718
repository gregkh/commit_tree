nfs: we don't support removing system.nfs4_acl

The NFSv4 protocol doesn't have any notion of reomoving an attribute, so
removexattr(path,"system.nfs4_acl") doesn't make sense.

There's no documented return value.  Arguably it could be EOPNOTSUPP but
I'm a little worried an application might take that to mean that we
don't support ACLs or xattrs.  How about EINVAL?
