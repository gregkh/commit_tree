net/mlx5e: Replace synchronize_rcu with synchronize_net

The commit cited below switched from using napi_synchronize to
synchronize_rcu to have a guarantee that it will finish in finite time.
However, on average, synchronize_rcu takes more time than
napi_synchronize. Given that it's called multiple times per channel on
deactivation, it accumulates to a significant amount, which causes
timeouts in some applications (for example, when using bonding with
NetworkManager).

This commit replaces synchronize_rcu with synchronize_net, which is
faster when called under rtnl_lock, allowing to speed up the described
flow.
