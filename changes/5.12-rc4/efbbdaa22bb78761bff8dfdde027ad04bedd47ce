tracing: Show real address for trace event arguments

To help debugging kernel, show real address for trace event arguments
in tracefs/trace{,pipe} instead of hashed pointer value.

Since ftrace human-readable format uses vsprintf(), all %p are
translated to hash values instead of pointer address.

However, when debugging the kernel, raw address value gives a
hint when comparing with the memory mapping in the kernel.
(Those are sometimes used with crash log, which is not hashed too)
So converting %p with %px when calling trace_seq_printf().

Moreover, this is not improving the security because the tracefs
can be used only by root user and the raw address values are readable
from tracefs/percpu/cpu*/trace_pipe_raw file.
