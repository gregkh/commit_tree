brcmfmac: Add DMI nvram filename quirk for Predia Basic tablet

The Predia Basic tablet contains quite generic names in the sys_vendor and
product_name DMI strings, without this patch brcmfmac will try to load:
brcmfmac43340-sdio.Insyde-CherryTrail.txt as nvram file which is a bit
too generic.

Add a DMI quirk so that a unique and clearly identifiable nvram file name
is used on the Predia Basic tablet.
