usb: dwc3: gadget: Remove check for bounded driver

The check for bounded gadget driver in dwc3_gadget_start() was to
prevent going through the initialization again without any cleanup. The
recent commit 49d08cfc7830 ("usb: udc: core: Introduce started state")
updated the UDC framework and guarantees this won't happen while the UDC
is started. Also, this check doesn't prevent requesting threaded irq to
the same dev_id, which will mess up the irq freeing logic. Let's remove
it.
