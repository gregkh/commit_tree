Revert "gfs2: Don't reject a supposedly full bitmap if we have blocks reserved"

This reverts commit e79e0e1428188b24c3b57309ffa54a33c4ae40c4.

It turns out that we're only setting the GBF_FULL flag of a bitmap if we've
been scanning from the beginning of the bitmap until the end and we haven't
found a single free block, and we're not skipping reservations in that process,
either.  This means that in gfs2_rbm_find, we can always skip bitmaps with the
GBF_FULL flag set.
