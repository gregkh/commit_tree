bpf: Enable bpf_{g,s}etsockopt in BPF_CGROUP_UDP{4,6}_RECVMSG

Those hooks run as BPF_CGROUP_RUN_SA_PROG_LOCK and operate on a locked socket.

Note that we could remove the switch for prog->expected_attach_type altogether
since all current sock_addr attach types are covered. However, it makes sense
to keep it as a safe-guard in case new sock_addr attach types are added that
might not operate on a locked socket. Therefore, avoid to let this slip through.
