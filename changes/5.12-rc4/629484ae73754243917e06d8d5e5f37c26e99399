mm: vmstat: add some comments on internal storage of byte items

Byte-accounted items are used for slab object accounting at the cgroup
level, because the objects in a slab page can belong to different cgroups.
At the global level these items always change in multiples of whole slab
pages.  The vmstat code exploits this and stores these items as pages
internally, which allows for more compact per-cpu data.

This optimization isn't self-evident from the asserts and the division in
the stat update functions.  Provide the reader with some context.
