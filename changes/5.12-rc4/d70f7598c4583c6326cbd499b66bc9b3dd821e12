usb: gadget: u_audio: clean up locking

snd_pcm_stream_lock() is held when the ALSA .trigger() callback is called.
The lock of 'struct uac_rtd_params' is not necessary since all its locking
operation are done under the snd_pcm_stream_lock() too.

Also, usb_request .complete() is called with irqs disabled, so saving and
restoring the irqs is not necessary.
