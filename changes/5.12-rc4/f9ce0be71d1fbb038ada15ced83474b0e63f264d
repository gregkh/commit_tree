mm: Cleanup faultaround and finish_fault() codepaths

alloc_set_pte() has two users with different requirements: in the
faultaround code, it called from an atomic context and PTE page table
has to be preallocated. finish_fault() can sleep and allocate page table
as needed.

PTL locking rules are also strange, hard to follow and overkill for
finish_fault().

Let's untangle the mess. alloc_set_pte() has gone now. All locking is
explicit.

The price is some code duplication to handle huge pages in faultaround
path, but it should be fine, having overall improvement in readability.
