drm/amd/display: Allow dmub srv hardware reset before HW init

[Why]
We need hardware reset before hardware init for backdoor loading when
we're reusing the framebuffer memory.

[How]
This doesn't run if the hardware isn't already in reset from software
perspective. The reset function has register level checks so just
remove the software one here.
