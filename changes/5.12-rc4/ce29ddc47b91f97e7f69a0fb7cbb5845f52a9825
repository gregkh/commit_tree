sched/membarrier: fix missing local execution of ipi_sync_rq_state()

The function sync_runqueues_membarrier_state() should copy the
membarrier state from the @mm received as parameter to each runqueue
currently running tasks using that mm.

However, the use of smp_call_function_many() skips the current runqueue,
which is unintended. Replace by a call to on_each_cpu_mask().
