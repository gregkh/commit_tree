block: reopen the device in blkdev_reread_part

Historically the BLKRRPART ioctls called into the now defunct ->revalidate
method, which caused the sd driver to check if any media is present.
When the ->revalidate method was removed this revalidation was lost,
leading to lots of I/O errors when using the eject command.  Fix this by
reopening the device to rescan the partitions, and thus calling the
revalidation logic in the sd driver.
