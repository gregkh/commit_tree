arm64: dts: qcom: Add support for remaining Sony Kitakami boards

This patch adds support for the following Xperias:

* Z3+ [aka Z4 in some regions] (Ivy)
* Z4 Tablet (Karin)
* Z4 Tablet Wi-Fi (Karin_windy) [APQ8094]
* Z5 Compact (Suzuran)
* Z5 Premium (Satsuki)

These devices are very similar in terms of hardware, with main
differences being display panels.

While at it, update comments describing hardware used:
SMB charger seems to not be used after all, PMI8994 charger
is in use instead.
