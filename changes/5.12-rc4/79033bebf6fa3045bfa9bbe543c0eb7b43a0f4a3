KVM: x86/xen: Fix coexistence of Xen and Hyper-V hypercalls

Disambiguate Xen vs. Hyper-V calls by adding 'orl $0x80000000, %eax'
at the start of the Hyper-V hypercall page when Xen hypercalls are
also enabled.

That bit is reserved in the Hyper-V ABI, and those hypercall numbers
will never be used by Xen (because it does precisely the same trick).

Switch to using kvm_vcpu_write_guest() while we're at it, instead of
open-coding it.
