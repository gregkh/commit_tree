objtool: Support addition to set CFA base

On arm64, the compiler can set the frame pointer either
with a move operation or with and add operation like:

    add (SP + constant), BP

For a simple move operation, the CFA base is changed from SP to BP.
Handle also changing the CFA base when the frame pointer is set with
an addition instruction.
