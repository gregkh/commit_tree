tracing: move function tracer options to Kconfig

Move function tracer options to Kconfig to make it easier to add
new methods for generating __mcount_loc, and to make the options
available also when building kernel modules.

Note that FTRACE_MCOUNT_USE_* options are updated on rebuild and
therefore, work even if the .config was generated in a different
environment.
