iio: adc: ad7949: fix wrong ADC result due to incorrect bit mask

Fixes a wrong bit mask used for the ADC's result, which was caused by an
improper usage of the GENMASK() macro. The bits higher than ADC's
resolution are undefined and if not masked out correctly, a wrong result
can be given. The GENMASK() macro indexing is zero based, so the mask has
to go from [resolution - 1 , 0].
