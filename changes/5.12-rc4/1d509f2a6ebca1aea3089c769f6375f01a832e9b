x86/insn: Support big endian cross-compiles

The x86 instruction decoder code is shared across the kernel source and
the tools. Currently objtool seems to be the only tool from build tools
needed which breaks x86 cross-compilation on big endian systems. Make
the x86 instruction decoder build host endianness agnostic to support
x86 cross-compilation and enable objtool to implement endianness
awareness for big endian architectures support.
