sysctl.c: fix underflow value setting risk in vm_table

Apart from subsystem specific .proc_handler handler, all ctl_tables with
extra1 and extra2 members set should use proc_dointvec_minmax instead of
proc_dointvec, or the limit set in extra* never work and potentially echo
underflow values(negative numbers) is likely make system unstable.

Especially vfs_cache_pressure and zone_reclaim_mode, -1 is apparently not
a valid value, but we can set to them.  And then kernel may crash.

# echo -1 > /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure
