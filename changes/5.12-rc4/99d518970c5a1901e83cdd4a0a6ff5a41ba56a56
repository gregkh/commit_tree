net: hns: fix variable used when DEBUG is defined

When DEBUG is defined this error occurs

drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hns/hns_enet.c:1505:36: error:
  ‘struct net_device’ has no member named ‘ae_handle’;
  did you mean ‘rx_handler’?
  assert(skb->queue_mapping < ndev->ae_handle->q_num);
                                    ^~~~~~~~~

ae_handle is an element of struct hns_nic_priv, so change
ndev to priv.
