vhost: Fix vhost_vq_reset()

vhost_reset_is_le() is vhost_init_is_le(), and in the case of
cross-endian legacy, vhost_init_is_le() depends on vq->user_be.

vq->user_be is set by vhost_disable_cross_endian().

But in vhost_vq_reset(), we have:

    vhost_reset_is_le(vq);
    vhost_disable_cross_endian(vq);

And so user_be is used before being set.

To fix that, reverse the lines order as there is no other dependency
between them.
