io_uring: convert io_buffer_idr to XArray

Like we did for the personality idr, convert the IO buffer idr to use
XArray. This avoids a use-after-free on removal of entries, since idr
doesn't like doing so from inside an iterator, and it nicely reduces
the amount of code we need to support this feature.
