static_call: Align static_call_is_init() patching condition

The intent is to avoid writing init code after init (because the text
might have been freed). The code is needlessly different between
jump_label and static_call and not obviously correct.

The existing code relies on the fact that the module loader clears the
init layout, such that within_module_init() always fails, while
jump_label relies on the module state which is more obvious and
matches the kernel logic.
