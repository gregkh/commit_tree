arch: setup PF_IO_WORKER threads like PF_KTHREAD

PF_IO_WORKER are kernel threads too, but they aren't PF_KTHREAD in the
sense that we don't assign ->set_child_tid with our own structure. Just
ensure that every arch sets up the PF_IO_WORKER threads like kthreads
in the arch implementation of copy_thread().
