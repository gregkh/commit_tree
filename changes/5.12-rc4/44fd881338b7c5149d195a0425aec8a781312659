dt-bindings:iio:imu:invensense,mpu6050: txt to yaml conversion

As Rob Herring suggested, this no long requires the explicit
i2c-gate binding, but instead just used i2c-controller.yaml
directly.

2 prior examples combinded into one as a single example can show
all of the binding elements as long as the right part is selected.
