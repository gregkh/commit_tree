ASoC: soc-pcm: use snd_pcm_hardware at dpcm_runtime_merge_xxx()

soc-pcm has dpcm_runtime_merge_xxx() functions,
but uses parameters are very verbose.

	dpcm_runtime_merge_format(...,	&runtime->hw.formats);
	dpcm_runtime_merge_chan(...,	&runtime->hw.channels_min,
					&runtime->hw.channels_max);
	dpcm_runtime_merge_rate(...,	&runtime->hw.rates,
					&runtime->hw.rate_min,
					&runtime->hw.rate_max);

We want to replace it into

	dpcm_runtime_merge_format(...,	runtime);
	dpcm_runtime_merge_chan(...,	runtime);
	dpcm_runtime_merge_rate(...,	runtime);

This patch do it.
