percpu_ref: Dump mem_dump_obj() info upon reference-count underflow

Reference-count underflow for percpu_ref is detected in the RCU callback
percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic_rcu(), and the resulting warning does not
print anything allowing easy identification of which percpu_ref use
case is underflowing.  This is of course not normally a problem when
developing a new percpu_ref use case because it is most likely that
the problem resides in this new use case.  However, when deploying a
new kernel to a large set of servers, the underflow might well be a new
corner case in any of the old percpu_ref use cases.

This commit therefore calls mem_dump_obj() to dump out any additional
available information on the underflowing percpu_ref instance.
