powerpc: Force inlining of cpu_has_feature() to avoid build failure

The code relies on constant folding of cpu_has_feature() based
on possible and always true values as defined per
CPU_FTRS_ALWAYS and CPU_FTRS_POSSIBLE.

Build failure is encountered with for instance
book3e_all_defconfig on kisskb in the AMDGPU driver which uses
cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_VSX_COMP) to decide whether calling
kernel_enable_vsx() or not.

The failure is due to cpu_has_feature() not being inlined with
that configuration with gcc 4.9.

In the same way as commit acdad8fb4a15 ("powerpc: Force inlining of
mmu_has_feature to fix build failure"), for inlining of
cpu_has_feature().
