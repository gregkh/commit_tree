ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for Pioneer DJM-750

This adds the Pioneer DJ DJM-750 to the quirks table and ensures
skip_pioneer_sync_ep() is (also) called: this device uses the vendor
ID of 0x08e4 (I'm not sure why they use multiple vendor IDs but many
just like to be awkward it seems).

Playback on all 8 channels works. I'll likely keep this working in the
future and submit futher patches and improvements as necessary.
