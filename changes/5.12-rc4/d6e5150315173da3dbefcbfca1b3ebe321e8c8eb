s390/qeth: don't fake a TX completion interrupt after TX error

When do_qdio() returns with an unexpected error, qeth_flush_buffers()
kicks off a recovery action.

In such a case there's no point in starting TX completion processing,
the device gets torn down anyway. So take a closer look at do_qdio()'s
return value, and skip the TX completion processing accordingly.
