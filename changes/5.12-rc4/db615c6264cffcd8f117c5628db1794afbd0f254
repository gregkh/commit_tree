usb: gadget: Introduce SSP rates and lanes

A USB device controller operating in SuperSpeed Plus may support gen2x1,
gen1x2, and/or gen2x2. Introduce SuperSpeed Plus signaling rate
generation and lane count to usb_gadget with the fields ssp_rate and
max_ssp_rate. The gadget driver can use these to setup the device BOS
descriptor and select the desire operating speed and number of lanes.
