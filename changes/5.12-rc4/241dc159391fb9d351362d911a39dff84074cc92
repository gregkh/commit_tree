net/mlx5: Notify on trap action by blocking event

In order to allow mlx5 core driver to trigger synchronous operations to
its consumers, add a blocking events handler. Add wrappers to
blocking_notifier_[call_chain/chain_register/chain_unregister]. Add trap
callback for action set and notify about this change. Following patches
in the set add a listener for this event.
