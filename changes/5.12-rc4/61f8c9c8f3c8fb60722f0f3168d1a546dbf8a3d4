selftests/bpf: Integrate the socket_cookie test to test_progs

Currently, the selftest for the BPF socket_cookie helpers is built and
run independently from test_progs. It's easy to forget and hard to
maintain.

This patch moves the socket cookies test into prog_tests/ and vastly
simplifies its logic by:
- rewriting the loading code with BPF skeletons
- rewriting the server/client code with network helpers
- rewriting the cgroup code with test__join_cgroup
- rewriting the error handling code with CHECKs
