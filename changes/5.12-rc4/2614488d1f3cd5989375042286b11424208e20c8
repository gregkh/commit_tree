RDMA/mlx5: Allow creating all QPs even when non RDMA profile is used

The cited commit disallowed creating any QP which isn't raw ethernet, reg
umr or the special UD qp for testing WC, this proved too strict.

While modify can't be done (no GIDS/GID table for example) just creating a
QP is okay.

This patch partially reverts the bellow mentioned commit and places the
restriction at the modify QP stage and not at the creation.  DEVX commands
should be used to manipulate such QPs.
