mac80211: enable QoS support for nl80211 ctrl port

This patch unifies sending control port frames
over nl80211 and AF_PACKET sockets a little more.

Before this patch, EAPOL frames got QoS prioritization
only when using AF_PACKET sockets.

__ieee80211_select_queue only selects a QoS-enabled queue
for control port frames, when the control port protocol
is set correctly on the skb. For the AF_PACKET path this
works, but the nl80211 path used ETH_P_802_3.

Another check for injected frames in wme.c then prevented
the QoS TID to be copied in the frame.

In order to fix this, get rid of the frame injection marking
for nl80211 ctrl port and set the correct ethernet protocol.

Please note:
An erlier version of this path tried to prevent
frame aggregation for control port frames in order to speed up
the initial connection setup a little. This seemed to cause
issues on my older Intel dvm-based hardware, and was therefore
removed again. Future commits which try to reintroduce this
have to check carefully how hw behaves with aggregated and
non-aggregated traffic for the same TID.
