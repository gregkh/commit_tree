soc: qcom: ocmem: don't return NULL in of_get_ocmem

If ocmem probe fails for whatever reason, of_get_ocmem returned NULL.
Without this, users must check for both NULL and IS_ERR on the returned
pointer - which didn't happen in drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/adreno_gpu.c
leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
