scsi: lpfc: Fix FW reset action if I/Os are outstanding

If the port is configured for NVME and has any outstanding IOs when a FW
reset is requesteed, outstanding I/Os are not properly cleaned up. This
causes the fw download request to fail.

Fix by clearing the LPFC_SLI_ACTIVE flag to signify the I/O must be
manually flushed by the driver on port reset.
