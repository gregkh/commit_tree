ice: create flash_info structure and separate NVM version

The ice_nvm_info structure has become somewhat of a dumping ground for
all of the fields related to flash version. It holds the NVM version and
EETRACK id, the OptionROM info structure, the flash size, the ShadowRAM
size, and more.

A future change is going to add the ability to read the NVM version and
EETRACK ID from the inactive NVM bank. To make this simpler, it is
useful to have these NVM version info fields extracted to their own
structure.

Rename ice_nvm_info into ice_flash_info, and create a separate
ice_nvm_info structure that will contain the eetrack and NVM map
version. Move the netlist_ver structure into ice_flash_info and rename it
ice_netlist_info for consistency.

Modify the static ice_get_orom_ver_info to take the option rom structure
as a pointer. This makes it more obvious what portion of the hw struct
is being modified. Do the same for ice_get_netlist_ver_info.

Introduce a new ice_get_nvm_ver_info function, which will be similar to
ice_get_orom_ver_info and ice_get_netlist_ver_info, used to keep the NVM
version extraction code co-located.
