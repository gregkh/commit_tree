media: uvcvideo: Accept invalid bFormatIndex and bFrameIndex values

The Renkforce RF AC4K 300 Action Cam 4K reports invalid bFormatIndex and
bFrameIndex values when negotiating the video probe and commit controls.
The UVC descriptors report a single supported format and frame size,
with bFormatIndex and bFrameIndex both equal to 2, but the video probe
and commit controls report bFormatIndex and bFrameIndex set to 1.

The device otherwise operates correctly, but the driver rejects the
values and fails the format try operation. Fix it by ignoring the
invalid indices, and assuming that the format and frame requested by the
driver are accepted by the device.
