ubifs: replay: Fix high stack usage, again

An earlier commit moved out some functions to not be inlined by gcc, but
after some other rework to remove one of those, clang started inlining
the other one and ran into the same problem as gcc did before:

fs/ubifs/replay.c:1174:5: error: stack frame size of 1152 bytes in function 'ubifs_replay_journal' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

Mark the function as noinline_for_stack to ensure it doesn't happen
again.
