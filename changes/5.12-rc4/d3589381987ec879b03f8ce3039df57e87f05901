nvme: add NVME_REQ_CANCELLED flag in nvme_cancel_request()

NVME_REQ_CANCELLED is translated into -EINTR in nvme_submit_sync_cmd(),
so we should be setting this flags during nvme_cancel_request() to
ensure that the callers to nvme_submit_sync_cmd() will get the correct
error code when the controller is reset.
