x86/kprobes: Do not decode opcode in resume_execution()

Currently, kprobes decodes the opcode right after single-stepping in
resume_execution(). But the opcode was already decoded while preparing
arch_specific_insn in arch_copy_kprobe().

Decode the opcode in arch_copy_kprobe() instead of in resume_execution()
and set some flags which classify the opcode for the resuming process.
