io_uring: remove the need for relying on an io-wq fallback worker

We hit this case when the task is exiting, and we need somewhere to
do background cleanup of requests. Instead of relying on the io-wq
task manager to do this work for us, just stuff it somewhere where
we can safely run it ourselves directly.
