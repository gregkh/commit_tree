s390: convert to generic entry

This patch converts s390 to use the generic entry infrastructure from
kernel/entry/*.

There are a few special things on s390:

- PIF_PER_TRAP is moved to TIF_PER_TRAP as the generic code doesn't
  know about our PIF flags in exit_to_user_mode_loop().

- The old code had several ways to restart syscalls:

  a) PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART, which was only set during execve to force a
     restart after upgrading a process (usually qemu-kvm) to pgste page
     table extensions.

  b) PIF_SYSCALL, which is set by do_signal() to indicate that the
     current syscall should be restarted. This is changed so that
     do_signal() now also uses PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART. Continuing to use
     PIF_SYSCALL doesn't work with the generic code, and changing it
     to PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART makes PIF_SYSCALL and PIF_SYSCALL_RESTART
     more unique.

- On s390 calling sys_sigreturn or sys_rt_sigreturn is implemented by
executing a svc instruction on the process stack which causes a fault.
While handling that fault the fault code sets PIF_SYSCALL to hand over
processing to the syscall code on exit to usermode.

The patch introduces PIF_SYSCALL_RET_SET, which is set if ptrace sets
a return value for a syscall. The s390x ptrace ABI uses r2 both for the
syscall number and return value, so ptrace cannot set the syscall number +
return value at the same time. The flag makes handling that a bit easier.
do_syscall() will just skip executing the syscall if PIF_SYSCALL_RET_SET
is set.

CONFIG_DEBUG_ASCE was removd in favour of the generic CONFIG_DEBUG_ENTRY.
CR1/7/13 will be checked both on kernel entry and exit to contain the
correct asces.
