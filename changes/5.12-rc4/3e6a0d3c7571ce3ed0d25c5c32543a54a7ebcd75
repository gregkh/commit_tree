io_uring: fix -EAGAIN retry with IOPOLL

We no longer revert the iovec on -EIOCBQUEUED, see commit ab2125df921d,
and this started causing issues for IOPOLL on devies that run out of
request slots. Turns out what outside of needing a revert for those, we
also had a bug where we didn't properly setup retry inside the submission
path. That could cause re-import of the iovec, if any, and that could lead
to spurious results if the application had those allocated on the stack.

Catch -EAGAIN retry and make the iovec stable for IOPOLL, just like we do
for !IOPOLL retries.
