remoteproc: qcom_wcnss: Add qcom,wcn3660b compatible

WCN3660B is a variant of WCN3660, but with the same regulator
requirements as WCN3620/WCN3680. As far as qcom_wcnss_iris is
concerned we can just use qcom,wcn3680 (wcn3680_data).

However, a separate compatible is needed for WCN3660B because
the wcn36xx driver uses it to enable chip-specific functionality.
In particular, it enables 802.11ac for qcom,wcn3680 which is not
supported by WCN3660B.
