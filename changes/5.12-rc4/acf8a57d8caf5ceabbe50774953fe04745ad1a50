media: venus: vdec: Fix non reliable setting of LAST flag

In real use of dynamic-resolution-change it is observed that the
LAST buffer flag (which marks the last decoded buffer with the
resolution before the resolution-change event) is not reliably set.

Fix this by set the LAST buffer flag on next queued capture buffer
after the resolution-change event.
