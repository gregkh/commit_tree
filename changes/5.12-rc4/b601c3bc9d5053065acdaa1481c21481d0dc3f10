KVM: x86/mmu: Factor out tdp_iter_return_to_root

In tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched there is a call to tdp_iter_start which
causes the iterator to continue its walk over the paging structure from
the root. This is needed after a yield as paging structure could have
been freed in the interim.

The tdp_iter_start call is not very clear and something of a hack. It
requires exposing tdp_iter fields not used elsewhere in tdp_mmu.c and
the effect is not obvious from the function name. Factor a more aptly
named function out of tdp_iter_start and call it from
tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched and tdp_iter_start.

No functional change intended.
