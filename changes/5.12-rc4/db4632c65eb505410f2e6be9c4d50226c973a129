Makefile: use smaller dictionary size for xz module compression

By default, xz without parameters uses a dictionary size of 8 MB.
However, most modules are much smaller than that.
The xz manpage states that 'increasing dictionary size usually improves
compression ratio, but a dictionary bigger than the uncompressed file
is waste of memory'.
Use a dictionary size of 2 MB for module compression, resulting in
slightly higher compression speed while still maintaining a good
compression ratio.
