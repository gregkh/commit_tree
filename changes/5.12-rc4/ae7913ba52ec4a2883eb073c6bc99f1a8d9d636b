btrfs: rename need_do_async_reclaim

All of our normal flushing is asynchronous reclaim, so this helper is
poorly named.  This is more checking if we need to preemptively flush
space, so rename it to need_preemptive_reclaim.

Also switch it to bool and make it plain static as followup patches will
move more code here.
