selftests: mptcp: fail if not enough SYN/3rd ACK

If we receive less MPCapable SYN or 3rd ACK than expected, we now mark
the test as failed.

On the other hand, if we receive more, we keep the warning but we add a
hint that it is probably due to retransmissions and that's why we don't
mark the test as failed.
