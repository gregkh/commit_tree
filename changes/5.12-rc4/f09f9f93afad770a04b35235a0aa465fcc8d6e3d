media: rc: compile rc-cec.c into rc-core

The rc-cec keymap is unusual in that it can't be built as a module,
instead it is registered directly in rc-main.c if CONFIG_MEDIA_CEC_RC
is set. This is because it can be called from drm_dp_cec_set_edid() via
cec_register_adapter() in an asynchronous context, and it is not
allowed to use request_module() to load rc-cec.ko in that case. Trying to
do so results in a 'WARN_ON_ONCE(wait && current_is_async())'.

Since this keymap is only used if CONFIG_MEDIA_CEC_RC is set, we
just compile this keymap into the rc-core module and never as a
separate module.
