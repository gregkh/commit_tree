arm64: cpufeature: Add an early command-line cpufeature override facility

In order to be able to override CPU features at boot time,
let's add a command line parser that matches options of the
form "cpureg.feature=value", and store the corresponding
value into the override val/mask pair.

No features are currently defined, so no expected change in
functionality.
