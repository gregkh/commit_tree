powerpc/powernv/pci: Use kzalloc() for phb related allocations

As part of commit fbbefb320214 ("powerpc/pci: Move PHB discovery for
PCI_DN using platforms"), I switched some allocations from
memblock_alloc() to kmalloc(), otherwise memblock would warn that it
was being called after slab init.

However I missed that the code relied on the allocations being zeroed,
without which we could end up crashing:

Switch them to kzalloc().
