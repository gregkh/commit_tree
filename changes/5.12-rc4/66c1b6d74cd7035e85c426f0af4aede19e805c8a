x86: Move TS_COMPAT back to asm/thread_info.h

Move TS_COMPAT back to asm/thread_info.h, close to TS_I386_REGS_POKED.

It was moved to asm/processor.h by b9d989c7218a ("x86/asm: Move the
thread_info::status field to thread_struct"), then later 37a8f7c38339
("x86/asm: Move 'status' from thread_struct to thread_info") moved the
'status' field back but TS_COMPAT was forgotten.

Preparatory patch to fix the COMPAT case for get_nr_restart_syscall()

Fixes: 609c19a385c8 ("x86/ptrace: Stop setting TS_COMPAT in ptrace code")
