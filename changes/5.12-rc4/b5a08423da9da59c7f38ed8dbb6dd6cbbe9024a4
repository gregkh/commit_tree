xfs: fix quota accounting when a mount is idmapped

Nowadays, we indirectly use the idmap-aware helper functions in the VFS
to set the initial uid and gid of a file being created.  Unfortunately,
we didn't convert the quota code, which means we attach the wrong dquots
to files created on an idmapped mount.
