NFSD: Repair misuse of sv_lock in 5.10.16-rt30.

[ This problem is in mainline, but only rt has the chops to be
able to detect it. ]

Lockdep reports a circular lock dependency between serv->sv_lock and
softirq_ctl.lock on system shutdown, when using a kernel built with
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y, and a nfs mount exists.

This is due to the definition of spin_lock_bh on rt:

	local_bh_disable();
	rt_spin_lock(lock);

which forces a softirq_ctl.lock -> serv->sv_lock dependency.  This is
not a problem as long as _every_ lock of serv->sv_lock is a:

	spin_lock_bh(&serv->sv_lock);

but there is one of the form:

	spin_lock(&serv->sv_lock);

This is what is causing the circular dependency splat.  The spin_lock()
grabs the lock without first grabbing softirq_ctl.lock via local_bh_disable.
If later on in the critical region,  someone does a local_bh_disable, we
get a serv->sv_lock -> softirq_ctrl.lock dependency established.  Deadlock.

Fix is to make serv->sv_lock be locked with spin_lock_bh everywhere, no
exceptions.
