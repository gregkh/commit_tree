Xen/gntdev: correct dev_bus_addr handling in gntdev_map_grant_pages()

We may not skip setting the field in the unmap structure when
GNTMAP_device_map is in use - such an unmap would fail to release the
respective resources (a page ref in the hypervisor). Otoh the field
doesn't need setting at all when GNTMAP_device_map is not in use.

To record the value for unmapping, we also better don't use our local
p2m: In particular after a subsequent change it may not have got updated
for all the batch elements. Instead it can simply be taken from the
respective map's results.

We can additionally avoid playing this game altogether for the kernel
part of the mappings in (x86) PV mode.

This is part of XSA-361.
