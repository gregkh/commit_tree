net: ipa: don't disable interrupt on suspend

No completion interrupts will occur while an endpoint is suspended,
nor when a channel has been stopped for suspend.  So there's no need
to disable the interrupt during suspend and re-enable it when
resuming.  Without any interrupts occurring, there is no need to
disable/re-enable NAPI for channel suspend/resume either.

We'll only enable NAPI and the interrupt when we first start the
channel, and disable it again only when it's "really" stopped.

To accomplish this, move the enable/disable calls out of
__gsi_channel_start() and __gsi_channel_stop(), and into
gsi_channel_start() and gsi_channel_stop() instead.

Add a call to napi_synchronize() to gsi_channel_suspend(), to ensure
NAPI polling is done before moving on.
