cifs: Identify a connection by a conn_id.

Introduced a new field conn_id in TCP_Server_Info structure.
This is a non-persistent unique identifier maintained by the client
for a connection to a file server. For this, a global counter named
tcpSesNextId is maintained. On allocating a new TCP_Server_Info,
this counter is incremented and assigned.

Changed the dynamic tracepoints related to reconnects and
crediting to be more informative (with conn_id printed).
Debugging a crediting issue helped me understand the
important things to print here.

Always call dynamic tracepoints outside the scope of spinlocks.
To do this, copy out the credits and in_flight fields of the
server struct before dropping the lock.
