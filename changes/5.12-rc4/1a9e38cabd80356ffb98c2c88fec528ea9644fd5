usb: dwc2: Make "trimming xfer length" a debug message

With some USB network adapters, such as DM96xx, the following message
is seen for each maximum size receive packet.

dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_update_urb_state(): trimming xfer length

This happens because the packet size requested by the driver is 1522
bytes, wMaxPacketSize is 64, the dwc2 driver configures the chip to
receive 24*64 = 1536 bytes, and the chip does indeed send more than
1522 bytes of data. Since the event does not indicate an error condition,
the message is just noise. Demote it to debug level.
