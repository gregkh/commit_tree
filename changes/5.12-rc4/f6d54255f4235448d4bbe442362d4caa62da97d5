io_uring: halt SQO submission on ctx exit

io_sq_thread_finish() is called in io_ring_ctx_free(), so SQPOLL task is
potentially running submitting new requests. It's not a disaster because
of using a "try" variant of percpu_ref_get, but is far from nice.

Remove ctx from the sqd ctx list earlier, before cancellation loop, so
SQPOLL can't find it and so won't submit new requests.
