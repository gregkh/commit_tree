KVM: x86: Take KVM's SRCU lock only if steal time update is needed

Enter a SRCU critical section for a memslots lookup during steal time
update if and only if a steal time update is actually needed.  Taking
the lock can be avoided if steal time is disabled by the guest, or if
KVM knows it has already flagged the vCPU as being preempted.

Reword the comment to be more precise as to exactly why memslots will
be queried.
