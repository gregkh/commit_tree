MAINTAINERS: move some real subsystems off of the staging mailing list

The VME and Android drivers still have their MAINTAINERS entries
pointing to the "driverdevel" mailing list, due to them having their
codebase move out of the drivers/staging/ directory, but no one
remembered to change the mailing list entries.

Move them both to linux-kernel for lack of a more specific place at the
moment.  These are both low-volume areas of the kernel, so this
shouldn't be an issue.
