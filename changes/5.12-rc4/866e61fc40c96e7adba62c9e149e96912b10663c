PCI/ACPI: Remove unnecessary osc_lock

9778c14b4ca2 ("ACPI/PCI: Fix possible race condition on _OSC evaluation")
added locking around _OSC calls to protect the acpi_osc_data_list that
stored the results.

63f10f0f6df4 ("PCI/ACPI: move _OSC code to pci_root.c") moved the results
from acpi_osc_data_list to the struct acpi_pci_root, where it no longer
needs locking, but did not remove the lock.

Remove the unnecessary locking around _OSC calls.
