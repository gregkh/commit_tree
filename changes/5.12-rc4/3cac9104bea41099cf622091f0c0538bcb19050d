usb: typec: Remove vdo[3] part of tps6598x_rx_identity_reg struct

Remove the unused "u32 vdo[3]" part in the tps6598x_rx_identity_reg
struct. This helps avoid "failed to register partner" errors which
happen when tps6598x_read_partner_identity() fails because the
amount of data read is 12 bytes smaller than the struct size.
Note that vdo[3] is already in usb_pd_identity and hence
shouldn't be added to tps6598x_rx_identity_reg as well.
