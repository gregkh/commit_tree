ASoC: codecs: lpass-wsa-macro: fix RX MIX input controls

Attempting to use the RX MIX path at 48kHz plays at 96kHz, because these
controls are incorrectly toggling the first bit of the register, which
is part of the FS_RATE field.

Fix the problem by using the same method used by the "WSA RX_MIX EC0_MUX"
control, which is to use SND_SOC_NOPM as the register and use an enum in
the shift field instead.
