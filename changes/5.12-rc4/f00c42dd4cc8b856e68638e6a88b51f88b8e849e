btrfs: introduce a FORCE_COMMIT_TRANS flush operation

Solely for preemptive flushing, we want to be able to force the
transaction commit without any of the ambiguity of
may_commit_transaction().  This is because may_commit_transaction()
checks tickets and such, and in preemptive flushing we already know
it'll be helpful, so use this to keep the code nice and clean and
straightforward.
