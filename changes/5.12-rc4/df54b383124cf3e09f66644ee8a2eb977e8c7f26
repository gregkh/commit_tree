kasan: clean up setting free info in kasan_slab_free

Put kasan_stack_collection_enabled() check and kasan_set_free_info() calls
next to each other.

The way this was previously implemented was a minor optimization that
relied of the the fact that kasan_stack_collection_enabled() is always
true for generic KASAN.  The confusion that this brings outweights saving
a few instructions.
