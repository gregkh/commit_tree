power: supply: axp20x_usb_power: Init work before enabling IRQs

The IRQ handler calls mod_delayed_work() on power->vbus_detect. However,
that work item is not initialized until after the IRQs are enabled. If
an IRQ is already pending when the driver is probed, the driver calls
mod_delayed_work() on an uninitialized work item, which causes an oops.
