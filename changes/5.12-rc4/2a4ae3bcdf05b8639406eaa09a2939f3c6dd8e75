ext4: fix timer use-after-free on failed mount

When filesystem mount fails because of corrupted filesystem we first
cancel the s_err_report timer reminding fs errors every day and only
then we flush s_error_work. However s_error_work may report another fs
error and re-arm timer thus resulting in timer use-after-free. Fix the
problem by first flushing the work and only after that canceling the
s_err_report timer.
