drm/msm/a5xx: Reset VBIF before PC only on A510 and A530

Resetting the VBIF before power collapse is done to avoid getting
bogus FIFO entries during the suspend sequence or subsequent resume,
but this is doable only on Adreno 510 and Adreno 530, as the other
units will tendentially lock up.
Especially on Adreno 508, the GPU will show lockups and very bad
slownesses after processing the first frame.

Avoiding to execute the RBBM SW Reset before suspend will stop the
lockup issue from happening on at least Adreno 508/509/512.
