ASoC: topology: Check if ops is set before dereference

Topology can be created without ops overrides, in that case trying to
assign any value would lead to dereferencing NULL pointer.

Other places in code have either checks for tplg->ops or loop using
*_count variables, hence they can't dereference NULL pointer and there
is no need to add more checks.
