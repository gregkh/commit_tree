nfsd: don't abort copies early

The typical result of the backwards comparison here is that the source
server in a server-to-server copy will return BAD_STATEID within a few
seconds of the copy starting, instead of giving the copy a full lease
period, so the copy_file_range() call will end up unnecessarily
returning a short read.
