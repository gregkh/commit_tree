ASoC: codecs: lpass-va-macro: mute/unmute all active decimators

An interface can have multiple decimators enabled, so loop over all active
decimators. Otherwise only one channel will be unmuted, and other channels
will be zero. This fixes recording from dual DMIC as a single two channel
stream.

Also remove the now unused "active_decimator" field.

Fixes: 908e6b1df26e ("ASoC: codecs: lpass-va-macro: Add support to VA Macro")
