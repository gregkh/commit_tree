powerpc/syscall: Force inlining of __prep_irq_for_enabled_exit()

As reported by kernel test robot, a randconfig with high amount of
debuging options can lead to build failure for undefined reference
to replay_soft_interrupts() on ppc32.

This is due to gcc not seeing that __prep_irq_for_enabled_exit()
always returns true on ppc32 because it doesn't inline it for
some reason.

Force inlining of __prep_irq_for_enabled_exit() to fix the build.
