media: usbtv: Fix deadlock on suspend

usbtv doesn't support power management, so on system suspend the
.disconnect callback of the driver is called. The teardown sequence
includes a call to snd_card_free. Its implementation waits until the
refcount of the sound card device drops to zero, however, if its file is
open, snd_card_file_add takes a reference, which can't be dropped during
the suspend, because the userspace processes are already frozen at this
point. snd_card_free waits for completion forever, leading to a hang on
suspend.

This commit fixes this deadlock condition by replacing snd_card_free
with snd_card_free_when_closed, that doesn't wait until all references
are released, allowing suspend to progress.
