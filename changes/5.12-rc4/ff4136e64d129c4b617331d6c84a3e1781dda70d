fat: only specify I_DIRTY_TIME when needed in fat_update_time()

As was done for generic_update_time(), only pass I_DIRTY_TIME to
__mark_inode_dirty() when the inode's timestamps were actually updated
and lazytime is enabled.  This avoids a weird edge case where
I_DIRTY_TIME could be set in i_state when lazytime isn't enabled.
