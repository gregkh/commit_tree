drm/msm/dpu: Allow specifying features and sblk in DSPP_BLK macro

The DSPP_BLK macro was ad-hoc made for SC7180, but this is wrong
because not all of the DPU DSPP versions can use the same DSPP block
configuration, and not all of them have got the same features.

For this reason, add two more params to the DSPP_BLK macro, so that
it is possible to specify the feature mask and the sblk config for
each DSPP.
