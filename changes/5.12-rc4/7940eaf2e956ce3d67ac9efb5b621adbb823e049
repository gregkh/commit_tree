s390/qdio: improve handling of PENDING buffers for QEBSM devices

For QEBSM devices the 'merge_pending' mechanism in get_buf_states()
doesn't apply, and we can actually get SLSB_P_OUTPUT_PENDING returned.

So for this case propagating the PENDING state to the driver via the
queue's sbal_state doesn't make sense and creates unnecessary overhead.
Instead introduce a new QDIO_ERROR_* flag that gets passed to the
driver, and triggers the same processing as if the buffers were flagged
as QDIO_OUTBUF_STATE_FLAG_PENDING.
