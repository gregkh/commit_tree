drm/i915/gvt: scan VM ctx pages

Logical Context is actually a big batch buffer consisting of multiple
LRI commands + saved registers. It comprises Ring Context (the first
0x50 dwords) and Engine Context. The registers defined in Engine Context
are command accessible, and safe to execute in VM Context.
This patch
1. stops copy Ring Context and only copys Engine Context from VM Context
2. audits VM Engine Contexts to disallow undesired LRIs
(if accessing registers out of Engine Context that hardware generates).
