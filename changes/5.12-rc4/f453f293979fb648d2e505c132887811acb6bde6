spi: cadence-quadspi: Add DTR support

Double Transfer Rate (DTR) mode transfers data twice per clock cycle.
Add support for parsing DTR ops and set up the registers to allow it.

Most SPI NOR flashes expect 2 byte commands. Parse the 2-byte opcode
from SPI MEM and set it up in the CQSPI_REG_OP_EXT_LOWER register.

Increment the delay needed before issuing indirect writes because larger
delay is needed for DTR mode. With the current delay some writes end up
missing.
