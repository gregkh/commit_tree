chelsio: cxgb: Replace the workqueue with threaded interrupt

The external interrupt (F_PL_INTR_EXT) needs to be handled in a process
context and this is accomplished by utilizing a workqueue.

The process context can also be provided by a threaded interrupt instead
of a workqueue. The threaded interrupt can be used later for other
interrupt related processing which require non-atomic context without
using yet another workqueue. free_irq() also ensures that the thread is
done which is currently missing (the worker could continue after the
module has been removed).

Save pending flags in pending_thread_intr. Use the same mechanism
to disable F_PL_INTR_EXT as interrupt source like it is used before the
worker is scheduled. Enable the interrupt again once
t1_elmer0_ext_intr_handler() is done.
