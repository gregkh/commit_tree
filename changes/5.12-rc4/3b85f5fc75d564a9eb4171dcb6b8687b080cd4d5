ALSA: usb-audio: Add DJM450 to Pioneer format quirk

Like the DJM-750, ensure that the format control message is passed to
the device when opening a stream. It seems as though fmt->sync_ep is not
always set when this function is called hence the passing of the value
at the call site. If this can be fixed, fmt->sync_up should be used as
the wvalue.

There doesn't seem to be a "cpu_to_le24" type function defined hence for
the open code but I did see a similar thing done in Bluez lib. Perhaps
we can get these definitions defined in byteorder.h. See hci_cpu_to_le24
in include/net/bluetooth/hci.h:2543 for similar usage.
