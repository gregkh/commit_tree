driver/perf: Remove ARM_SMMU_V3_PMU dependency on ARM_SMMU_V3

The ARM_SMMU_V3_PMU dependency on ARM_SMMU_V3_PMU was added with the idea
that a SMMUv3 PMCG would only exist on a system with an associated SMMUv3.

However it is not the job of Kconfig to make these sorts of decisions (even
if it were true), so remove the dependency.
