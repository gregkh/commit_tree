drm/i915/gt: Prune 'inline' from execlists

Remove the extraneous inlines. The only split by the compiler that
looked dubious was execlists_schedule_out, so push the code around
slightly to move all the work into the out-of-line function.

In a normal build, bloat-o-meter shows that only the
execlists_schedule_out is contentious:
