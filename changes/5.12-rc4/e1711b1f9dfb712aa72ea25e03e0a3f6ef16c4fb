ASoC: SOF: add be_hw_params_fixup() for ALH

Fixup BE DAI links channel count to match topology settings. Normally the
channel count of BE is equal to FE's so we don't have any issue. For some
cases like DSM with 2-channel FE and 4-channel BE the mismatch of BE and
topology will result in audio issues.
