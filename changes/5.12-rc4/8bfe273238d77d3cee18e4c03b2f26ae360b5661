objtool: Fix x86 orc generation on big endian cross-compiles

Correct objtool orc generation endianness problems to enable fully
functional x86 cross-compiles on big endian hardware.

Introduce bswap_if_needed() macro, which does a byte swap if target
endianness doesn't match the host, i.e. cross-compilation for little
endian on big endian and vice versa.  The macro is used for conversion
of multi-byte values which are read from / about to be written to a
target native endianness ELF file.
