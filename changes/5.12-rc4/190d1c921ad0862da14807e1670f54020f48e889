samples/bpf: Set flag __SANE_USERSPACE_TYPES__ for MIPS to fix build warnings

There exists many build warnings when make M=samples/bpf on the Loongson
platform, this issue is MIPS related, x86 compiles just fine.

Here are some warnings:

  CC  samples/bpf/ibumad_user.o
samples/bpf/ibumad_user.c: In function ‘dump_counts’:
samples/bpf/ibumad_user.c:46:24: warning: format ‘%llu’ expects argument of type ‘long long unsigned int’, but argument 3 has type ‘__u64’ {aka ‘long unsigned int’} [-Wformat=]
    printf("0x%02x : %llu\n", key, value);
                     ~~~^          ~~~~~
                     %lu
  CC  samples/bpf/offwaketime_user.o
samples/bpf/offwaketime_user.c: In function ‘print_ksym’:
samples/bpf/offwaketime_user.c:34:17: warning: format ‘%llx’ expects argument of type ‘long long unsigned int’, but argument 3 has type ‘__u64’ {aka ‘long unsigned int’} [-Wformat=]
   printf("%s/%llx;", sym->name, addr);
              ~~~^               ~~~~
              %lx
samples/bpf/offwaketime_user.c: In function ‘print_stack’:
samples/bpf/offwaketime_user.c:68:17: warning: format ‘%lld’ expects argument of type ‘long long int’, but argument 3 has type ‘__u64’ {aka ‘long unsigned int’} [-Wformat=]
  printf(";%s %lld\n", key->waker, count);
              ~~~^                 ~~~~~
              %ld

MIPS needs __SANE_USERSPACE_TYPES__ before <linux/types.h> to select
'int-ll64.h' in arch/mips/include/uapi/asm/types.h, then it can avoid
build warnings when printing __u64 with %llu, %llx or %lld.

The header tools/include/linux/types.h defines __SANE_USERSPACE_TYPES__,
it seems that we can include <linux/types.h> in the source files which
have build warnings, but it has no effect due to actually it includes
usr/include/linux/types.h instead of tools/include/linux/types.h, the
problem is that "usr/include" is preferred first than "tools/include"
in samples/bpf/Makefile, that sounds like a ugly hack to -Itools/include
before -Iusr/include.

So define __SANE_USERSPACE_TYPES__ for MIPS in samples/bpf/Makefile
is proper, if add "TPROGS_CFLAGS += -D__SANE_USERSPACE_TYPES__" in
samples/bpf/Makefile, it appears the following error:

Auto-detecting system features:
...                        libelf: [ on  ]
...                          zlib: [ on  ]
...                           bpf: [ OFF ]

BPF API too old
make[3]: *** [Makefile:293: bpfdep] Error 1
make[2]: *** [Makefile:156: all] Error 2

With #ifndef __SANE_USERSPACE_TYPES__  in tools/include/linux/types.h,
the above error has gone and this ifndef change does not hurt other
compilations.
