cifs: use discard iterator to discard unneeded network data more efficiently

The iterator, ITER_DISCARD, that can only be used in READ mode and
just discards any data copied to it, was added to allow a network
filesystem to discard any unwanted data sent by a server.
Convert cifs_discard_from_socket() to use this.
