virtiofs: Fail dax mount if device does not support it

Right now "mount -t virtiofs -o dax myfs /mnt/virtiofs" succeeds even
if filesystem deivce does not have a cache window and hence DAX can't
be supported.

This gives a false sense to user that they are using DAX with virtiofs
but fact of the matter is that they are not.

Fix this by returning error if dax can't be supported and user has asked
for it.
