KVM/nVMX: Use __vmx_vcpu_run in nested_vmx_check_vmentry_hw

Replace inline assembly in nested_vmx_check_vmentry_hw
with a call to __vmx_vcpu_run.  The function is not
performance critical, so (double) GPR save/restore
in __vmx_vcpu_run can be tolerated, as far as performance
effects are concerned.
