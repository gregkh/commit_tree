media: imx: Unregister csc/scaler only if registered

The csc/scaler device pointer (imxmd->m2m_vdev) is assigned
after the imx media device v4l2-async probe completes,
therefore we need to check if the device is non-NULL
before trying to unregister it.

This can be the case if the non-completed imx media device
is unbinded (or the driver is removed), leading to a kernel oops.
