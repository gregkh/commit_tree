pwm: rockchip: Eliminate potential race condition when probing

Commit 48cf973cae33 ("pwm: rockchip: Avoid glitches on already running
PWMs") introduced a potential race condition in rockchip_pwm_probe(): A
consumer could enable an inactive PWM, or disable a running one, between
rockchip_pwm_probe() registering the device via pwmchip_add() and checking
whether it is enabled (to determine whether it was started by a
bootloader). This could result in a device's PWM clock being either enabled
once more than necessary, potentially causing it to continue running when
no longer needed, or disabled once more than necessary, producing a warning
from the kernel.

Eliminate these possibilities by modifying rockchip_pwm_probe() so it
checks whether a device is enabled before registering it rather than after.
