memory: tegra124-emc: Make driver modular

Add modularization support to the Tegra124 EMC driver, which now can be
compiled as a loadable kernel module.

Note that EMC clock must be registered at clk-init time, otherwise PLLM
will be disabled as unused clock at boot time if EMC driver is compiled
as a module. Hence add a prepare/complete callbacks. similarly to what is
done for the Tegra20/30 EMC drivers.
