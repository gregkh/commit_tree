octeontx2-af: cn10k: Add support for programmable channels

NIX uses unique channel numbers to identify the packet sources/sinks
like CGX,LBK and SDP. The channel numbers assigned to each block are
hardwired in CN9xxx silicon.
The fixed channel numbers in CN9xxx are:

0x0 | a << 8 | b            - LBK(0..3)_CH(0..63)
0x0 | a << 8                - Reserved
0x700 | a                   - SDP_CH(0..255)
0x800 | a << 8 | b << 4 | c - CGX(0..7)_LMAC(0..3)_CH(0..15)

All the channels in the above fixed enumerator(with maximum
number of blocks) are not required since some chips
have less number of blocks.
For CN10K silicon the channel numbers need to be programmed by
software in each block with the base channel number and range of
channels. This patch calculates and assigns the channel numbers
to efficiently distribute the channel number range(0-4095) among
all the blocks. The assignment is made based on the actual number of
blocks present and also contiguously leaving no holes.
The channel numbers remaining after the math are used as new CPT
replay channels present in CN10K. Also since channel numbers are
not fixed the transmit channel link number needed by AF consumers
is calculated by AF and sent along with nix_lf_alloc mailbox response.
