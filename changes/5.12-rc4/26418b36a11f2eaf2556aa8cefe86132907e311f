powerpc/64s/radix: refactor TLB flush type selection

The logic to decide what kind of TLB flush is required (local, global,
or IPI) is spread multiple times over the several kinds of TLB flushes.

Move it all into a single function which may issue IPIs if necessary,
and also returns a flush type that is to be used.
