gpio: tegra: Fix wake interrupt

The GPIO bank wake interrupt setting was erroneously removed after
conversion to gpio_irq_chip, thus the wake interrupt programming is
broken now. Secondly, the wake_enb of the GPIO driver should be changed
only after the successful toggling of the IRQ wake-state. Restore the wake
interrupt setting and the programming order.
