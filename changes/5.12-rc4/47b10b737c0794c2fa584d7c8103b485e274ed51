arm64: topology: Reorder init_amu_fie() a bit

This patch does a couple of optimizations in init_amu_fie(), like early
exits from paths where we don't need to continue any further, avoid the
enable/disable dance, moving the calls to
topology_scale_freq_invariant() just when we need them, instead of at
the top of the routine, and avoiding calling it for the third time.
