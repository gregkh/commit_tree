KVM: x86/mmu: Don't set dirty bits when disabling dirty logging w/ PML

Stop setting dirty bits for MMU pages when dirty logging is disabled for
a memslot, as PML is now completely disabled when there are no memslots
with dirty logging enabled.

This means that spurious PML entries will be created for memslots with
dirty logging disabled if at least one other memslot has dirty logging
enabled.  However, spurious PML entries are already possible since
dirty bits are set only when a dirty logging is turned off, i.e. memslots
that are never dirty logged will have dirty bits cleared.

In the end, it's faster overall to eat a few spurious PML entries in the
window where dirty logging is being disabled across all memslots.
