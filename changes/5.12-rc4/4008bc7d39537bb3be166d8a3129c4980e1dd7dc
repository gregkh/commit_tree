hwmon: (dell-smm) Add XPS 15 L502X to fan control blacklist

It has been reported[0] that the Dell XPS 15 L502X exhibits similar
freezing behavior to the other systems[1] on this blacklist. The issue
was exposed by a prior change of mine to automatically load
dell_smm_hwmon on a wider set of XPS models. To fix the regression, add
this model to the blacklist.
