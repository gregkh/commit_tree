mfd: arizona: Add support for ACPI enumeration of WM5102 connected over SPI

The Intel Bay Trail (x86/ACPI) based Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 series use
a WM5102 codec connected over SPI.

Add support for ACPI enumeration to arizona-spi so that arizona-spi can
bind to the codec on these tablets.

This is loosely based on an earlier attempt (for Android-x86) at this by
Christian Hartmann, combined with insights in things like the speaker GPIO
from the android-x86 android port for the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 1051F/L [1].
