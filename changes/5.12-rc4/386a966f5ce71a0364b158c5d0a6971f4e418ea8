vio: make remove callback return void

The driver core ignores the return value of struct bus_type::remove()
because there is only little that can be done. To simplify the quest to
make this function return void, let struct vio_driver::remove() return
void, too. All users already unconditionally return 0, this commit makes
it obvious that returning an error code is a bad idea.

Note there are two nominally different implementations for a vio bus:
one in arch/sparc/kernel/vio.c and the other in
arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/vio.c. This patch only adapts the powerpc
one.

Before this patch for a device that was bound to a driver without a
remove callback vio_cmo_bus_remove(viodev) wasn't called. As the device
core still considers the device unbound after vio_bus_remove() returns
calling this unconditionally is the consistent behaviour which is
implemented here.
