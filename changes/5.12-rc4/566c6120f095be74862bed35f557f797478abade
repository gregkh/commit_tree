spi: hisi-sfc-v3xx: extend version checking compatibility

Currently we use concrete version to determine the max_cmd_dword.
New entries should be added for compatible hardwares of new version
or on new platform, otherwise the device will use 16 dwords instead
of 64 even if it supports, which will degrade the performance.
This will decrease the compatibility and the maintainability.

Drop the switch-case statement of the version checking. Only version
less than 0x351 supports maximum 16 command dwords.
