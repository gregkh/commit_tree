Input: i8042 - add ASUS Zenbook Flip to noselftest list

After commit 77b425399f6d ("Input: i8042 - use chassis info to skip
selftest on Asus laptops"), all modern Asus laptops have the i8042
selftest disabled. It has done by using chassys type "10" (laptop).

The Asus Zenbook Flip suffers from similar suspend/resume issues, but
it _sometimes_ work and sometimes it doesn't. Setting noselftest makes
it work reliably. In this case, we need to add chassis type "31"
(convertible) in order to avoid selftest in this device.
