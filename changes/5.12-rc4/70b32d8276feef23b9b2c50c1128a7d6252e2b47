dpaa2-eth: add support for Rx VLAN filtering

Declare Rx VLAN filtering as supported and user-changeable only when
there are VLAN filtering entries available on the DPNI object. Even
then, rx-vlan-filtering is by default disabled.
Also, populate the .ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid() and .ndo_vlan_rx_kill_vid()
callbacks for adding and removing a specific VLAN from the VLAN table.
