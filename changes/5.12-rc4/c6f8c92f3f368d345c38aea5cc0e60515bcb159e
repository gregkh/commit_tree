arm64: Drop early setting of MDSCR_EL2.TPMS

When running VHE, we set MDSCR_EL2.TPMS very early on to force
the trapping of EL1 SPE accesses to EL2.

However:
- we are running with HCR_EL2.{E2H,TGE}={1,1}, meaning that there
  is no EL1 to trap from

- before entering a guest, we call kvm_arm_setup_debug(), which
  sets MDCR_EL2_TPMS in the per-vcpu shadow mdscr_el2, which gets
  applied on entry by __activate_traps_common().

The early setting of MDSCR_EL2.TPMS is therefore useless and can
be dropped.
