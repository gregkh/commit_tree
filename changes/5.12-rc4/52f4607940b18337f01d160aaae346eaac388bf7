KVM: x86: Further clarify the logic and comments for toggling log dirty

Add a sanity check in kvm_mmu_slot_apply_flags to assert that the
LOG_DIRTY_PAGES flag is indeed being toggled, and explicitly rely on
that holding true when zapping collapsible SPTEs.  Manipulating the
CPU dirty log (PML) and write-protection also relies on this assertion,
but that's not obvious in the current code.
