arm64: cpufeature: Use IDreg override in __read_sysreg_by_encoding()

__read_sysreg_by_encoding() is used by a bunch of cpufeature helpers,
which should take the feature override into account. Let's do that.

For a good measure (and because we are likely to need to further
down the line), make this helper available to the rest of the
non-modular kernel.

Code that needs to know the *real* features of a CPU can still
use read_sysreg_s(), and find the bare, ugly truth.
