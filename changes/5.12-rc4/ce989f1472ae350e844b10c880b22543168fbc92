RISC-V: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in init_resources()

init_resources() allocates an array of resources, based on the current
total number of memory regions and reserved memory regions.  However,
allocating this array using memblock_alloc() might increase the number
of reserved memory regions.  If that happens, populating the array later
based on the new number of regions will cause out-of-bounds writes
beyond the end of the allocated array.

Fix this by allocating one more entry, which may or may not be used.
