rpc: fix NULL dereference on kmalloc failure

I think this is unlikely but possible:

svc_authenticate sets rq_authop and calls svcauth_gss_accept.  The
kmalloc(sizeof(*svcdata), GFP_KERNEL) fails, leaving rq_auth_data NULL,
and returning SVC_DENIED.

This causes svc_process_common to go to err_bad_auth, and eventually
call svc_authorise.  That calls ->release == svcauth_gss_release, which
tries to dereference rq_auth_data.
