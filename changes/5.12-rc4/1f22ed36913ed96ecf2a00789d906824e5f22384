drm/dsc: use rc_model_size from DSC config for PPS

The PPS is supposed to reflect the DSC config instead of hard coding the
rc_model_size. Make it so.

Currently all users of drm_dsc_pps_payload_pack() hard code the size to
8192 also in the DSC config, so this change should have no impact, other
than allowing the drivers to use other sizes as needed.
