arm64: topology: Avoid the have_policy check

Every time I have stumbled upon this routine, I get confused with the
way 'have_policy' is used and I have to dig in to understand why is it
so. Here is an attempt to make it easier to understand, and hopefully it
is an improvement.

The 'have_policy' check was just an optimization to avoid writing
to amu_fie_cpus in case we don't have to, but that optimization itself
is creating more confusion than the real work. Lets just do that if all
the CPUs support AMUs. It is much cleaner that way.
