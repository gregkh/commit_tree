nvmet: don't check iosqes,iocqes for discovery controllers

From the base spec, Figure 78:

  "Controller Configuration, these fields are defined as parameters to
   configure an "I/O Controller (IOC)" and not to configure a "Discovery
   Controller (DC).

   ...
   If the controller does not support I/O queues, then this field shall
   be read-only with a value of 0h

Just perform this check for I/O controllers.
