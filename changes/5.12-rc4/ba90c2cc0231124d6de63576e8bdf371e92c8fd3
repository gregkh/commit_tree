bpf: Allow usage of BPF ringbuffer in sleepable programs

The BPF ringbuffer map is pre-allocated and the implementation logic
does not rely on disabling preemption or per-cpu data structures. Using
the BPF ringbuffer sleepable LSM and tracing programs does not trigger
any warnings with DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP, DEBUG_PREEMPT,
PROVE_RCU and PROVE_LOCKING and LOCKDEP enabled.

This allows helpers like bpf_copy_from_user and bpf_ima_inode_hash to
write to the BPF ring buffer from sleepable BPF programs.
