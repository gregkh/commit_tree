mac80211: minstrel_ht: fix rounding error in throughput calculation

On lower data rates, the throughput calculation has a significant rounding
error, causing rates like 48M and 54M OFDM to share the same throughput
value with >= 90% success probablity.

This is because the result of the division (prob_avg * 1000) / nsecs
is really small (8 in this example).

Improve accuracy by moving over some zeroes, making better use of the full
range of u32 before the division.
