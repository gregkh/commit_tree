ALSA: hda: generic: Fix the micmute led init state

Recently we found the micmute led init state is not correct after
freshly installing the ubuntu linux on a Lenovo AIO machine. The
internal mic is not muted, but the micmute led is on and led mode is
'follow mute'. If we mute internal mic, the led is keeping on, then
unmute the internal mic, the led is off. And from then on, the
micmute led will work correctly.

So the micmute led init state is not correct. The led is controlled
by codec gpio (ALC233_FIXUP_LENOVO_LINE2_MIC_HOTKEY), in the
patch_realtek, the gpio data is set to 0x4 initially and the led is
on with this data. In the hda_generic, the led_value is set to
0 initially, suppose users set the 'capture switch' to on from
user space and the micmute led should change to be off with this
operation, but the check "if (val == spec->micmute_led.led_value)" in
the call_micmute_led_update() will skip the led setting.

To guarantee the led state will be set by the 1st time of changing
"Capture Switch", set -1 to the init led_value.
