rapidio: convert switch drivers to modules

Rework RapidIO switch drivers to add an option to build them as loadable
kernel modules.

This patch removes RapidIO-specific vmlinux section and converts switch
drivers to be compatible with LDM driver registration method.  To simplify
registration of device-specific callback routines this patch introduces
rio_switch_ops data structure.  The sw_sysfs() callback is removed from
the list of device-specific operations because under the new structure its
functions can be handled by switch driver's probe() and remove() routines.

If a specific switch device driver is not loaded the RapidIO subsystem
core will use default standard-based operations to configure a switch.
Because the current implementation of RapidIO enumeration/discovery method
relies on availability of device-specific operations for error management,
switch device drivers must be loaded before the RapidIO
enumeration/discovery starts.

This patch also moves several common routines from enumeration/discovery
module into the RapidIO core code to make switch-specific operations
accessible to all components of RapidIO subsystem.
