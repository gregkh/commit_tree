ACPI / scan: Do not bind ACPI drivers to objects with scan handlers

ACPI drivers must not be bound to device objects having scan handlers
attatched to them, so make acpi_device_probe() fail with -EINVAL if the
device object being probed has an ACPI scan handler.

After this change the analogous check introduced into the ACPI video
driver by commit 8c9b7a7 (ACPI / video: Do not bind to device objects
with a scan handler) is not necessary any more and may be dropped, so
drop it.
