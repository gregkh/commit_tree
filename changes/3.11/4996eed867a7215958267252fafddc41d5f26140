mm/memory_hotplug.c: change normal message to use pr_debug

During early boot-up, iomem_resource is set up from the boot descriptor
table, such as EFI Memory Table and e820.  Later,
acpi_memory_device_add() calls add_memory() for each ACPI memory device
object as it enumerates ACPI namespace.  This add_memory() call is
expected to fail in register_memory_resource() at boot since
iomem_resource has been set up from EFI/e820.  As a result, add_memory()
returns -EEXIST, which acpi_memory_device_add() handles as the normal
case.

This scheme works fine, but the following error message is logged for
every ACPI memory device object during boot-up.

  "System RAM resource %pR cannot be added\n"

This patch changes register_memory_resource() to use pr_debug() for the
message as it shows up under the normal case.
