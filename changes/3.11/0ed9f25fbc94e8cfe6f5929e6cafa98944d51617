staging: comedi: addi_apci_3xxx: refactor 'i_NbrTTLChannel' boardinfo

The boards that have ttl input and output channels always have 24
channels.

Remove the 'i_NbrTTLChannel' data from the boardinfo and add a bit
field to indicate that the board 'has_ttl_io'. Use that to conditionally
initialize the subdevice and open code the s->n_chan value of 24.
