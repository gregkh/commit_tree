ARM: kvm: don't include drivers/virtio/Kconfig

The virtio configuration has recently moved and is now visible everywhere.
Including the file again from KVM as we used to need earlier now causes
dependency problems:

warning: (CAIF_VIRTIO && VIRTIO_PCI && VIRTIO_MMIO && REMOTEPROC && RPMSG)
selects VIRTIO which has unmet direct dependencies (VIRTUALIZATION)
