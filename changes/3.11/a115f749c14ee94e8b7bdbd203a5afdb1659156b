ext4: remove wait for unwritten extent conversion from ext4_truncate()

Since PageWriteback bit is now cleared after extents are converted
from unwritten to written ones, we have full exclusion of writeback
path from truncate (truncate_inode_pages() waits for PageWriteback
bits to get cleared on all invalidated pages).  Exclusion from DIO
path is achieved by inode_dio_wait() call in ext4_setattr().  So
there's no need to wait for extent convertion in ext4_truncate()
anymore.
