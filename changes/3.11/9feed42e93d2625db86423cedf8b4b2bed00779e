powerpc/eeh: Use safe list traversal when walking EEH devices

Currently, we're trasversing the EEH devices list using list_for_each_entry().
That's not safe enough because the EEH devices might be removed from
its parent PE while doing iteration. The patch replaces that with
list_for_each_entry_safe().
