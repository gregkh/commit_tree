MIPS: BCM63XX: recognize Cable Modem firmware format

Add the firmware header format which is used by Broadcom Cable Modem
SoCs such as the BCM3368 SoC. We export the bcm_hcs firmware format
structure because it is used by user-land tools to create firmware
images for these SoCs and will later be used by a corresponding MTD
parser.
