ASoC: tegra: fix Tegra30 I2S capture parameter setup

The Tegra30 I2S driver was writing the AHUB interface parameters to the
playback path register rather than the capture path register. This
caused the capture parameters not to be configured at all, so if
capturing using non-HW-default parameters (e.g. 16-bit stereo rather
than 8-bit mono) the audio would be corrupted.

With this fixed, audio capture from an analog microphone works correctly
on the Cardhu board.
