eCryptfs: Combine encrypt_scatterlist() and decrypt_scatterlist()

These two functions are identical except for a debug printk and whether
they call crypto_ablkcipher_encrypt() or crypto_ablkcipher_decrypt(), so
they can be safely merged if the caller can indicate if encryption or
decryption should occur.

The debug printk is useless so it is removed.

Two new #define's are created to indicate if an ENCRYPT or DECRYPT
operation is desired.
