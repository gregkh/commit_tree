Driver core: Introduce offline/online callbacks for memory blocks

Introduce .offline() and .online() callbacks for memory_subsys
that will allow the generic device_offline() and device_online()
to be used with device objects representing memory blocks.  That,
in turn, allows the ACPI subsystem to use device_offline() to put
removable memory blocks offline, if possible, before removing
memory modules holding them.

The 'online' sysfs attribute of memory block devices will attempt to
put them offline if 0 is written to it and will attempt to apply the
previously used online type when onlining them (i.e. when 1 is
written to it).
