ipc,msg: introduce msgctl_nolock

Similar to semctl, when calling msgctl, the *_INFO and *_STAT commands
can be performed without acquiring the ipc object.

Add a msgctl_nolock() function and move the logic of *_INFO and *_STAT
out of msgctl().  This change still takes the lock and it will be
properly lockless in the next patch
