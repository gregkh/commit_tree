mm: remove unused VM_<READfoo> macros and expand other in-place

These VM_<READfoo> macros aren't used very often and three of them
aren't used at all.

Expand the ones that are used in-place, and remove all the now unused
#define VM_<foo> macros.

VM_READHINTMASK, VM_NormalReadHint and VM_ClearReadHint were added just
before 2.4 and appears have never been used.
