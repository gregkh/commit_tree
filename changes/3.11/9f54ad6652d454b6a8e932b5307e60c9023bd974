arm64/xen: introduce asm/xen header files on arm64

asm/xen/hypercall.h, asm/xen/hypervisor.h, asm/xen/interface.h and
asm/xen/page.h are identical so to avoid code duplication we are just
including the original arm header files here.

asm/xen/events.h is slightly different, so introduce a different file
here (use xchg to implement xchg_xen_ulong and pass regs->pstate to
raw_irqs_disabled_flags).

Also introduce asm/hypervisor.h and asm/sync_bitops.h.
