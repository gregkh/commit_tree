usb: musb: re-introduce musb->port_mode

Define MUSB_PORT_MODE_{HOST,GADGET,DUAL_ROLE} and store the
platform-specified value in struct musb.

Note that MUSB_PORT_MODE_HOST has to be set to 1 in order to match
existing device tree bindings which are already documented but in fact
unusued. For information on the bindings, please refer to

  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/omap-usb.txt
