bnx2x: use XPS if possible for bnx2x_select_queue instead of pure hash

The bnx2x_select_queue() was using __skb_tx_hash() to select the
transmit queue, totally ignoring XPS settings, while XPS can help
performance quite significantly, so change the bnx2x_select_queue()
to use __dev_pick_tx() instead which will use XPS if configured.
