sched: Ensure update_cfs_shares() is called for parents of continuously-running tasks

We typically update a task_group's shares within the dequeue/enqueue
path.  However, continuously running tasks sharing a CPU are not
subject to these updates as they are only put/picked.  Unfortunately,
when we reverted f269ae046 (in 17bc14b7), we lost the augmenting
periodic update that was supposed to account for this; resulting in a
potential loss of fairness.

To fix this, re-introduce the explicit update in
update_cfs_rq_blocked_load() [called via entity_tick()].
