drm/i915: change i915_add_request to macro

Only execbuffer needed all the parameters on i915_add_request().
By putting __i915_add_request behind macro, all current callsites
become cleaner. Following patch will introduce a new parameter
for __i915_add_request. With this patch, only the relevant callsite
will reflect the change making commit smaller and easier to understand.

v2: _i915_add_request as function name (Chris Wilson)

v3: change name __i915_add_request and fix ordering of params (Ben Widawsky)
