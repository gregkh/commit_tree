x86/intel/cacheinfo: Shut up last long-standing warning

arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c: In function ‘init_intel_cacheinfo’:
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c:642:28: warning: ‘this_leaf.size’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized] arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c:643:29: warning: ‘this_leaf.eax.split.num_threads_sharing’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

This keeps on happening during randbuilds and the compiler is
wrong here:

In the case where cpuid4_cache_lookup_regs() returns 0, both
this_leaf.size and this_leaf.eax get initialized. In the case
where the CPUID leaf doesn't contain valid cache info, we error
out which init_intel_cacheinfo() handles correctly without
touching the abovementioned fields.

So shut up the warning by clearing out the struct which we hand
down.

While at it, reverse error handling and gain one indentation
level.
