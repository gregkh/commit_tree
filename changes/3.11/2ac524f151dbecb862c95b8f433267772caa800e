ARM: OMAP5: voltagedomain data: remove temporary OMAP4 voltage data

commit 20d49e9ccfece526db755940721aa13e331936d4
(ARM: OMAP5: voltagedomain data: Add OMAP5 voltage domain data)

Introduced dummy volt data for OMAP5 with OMAP4460 voltage information.

However with the fixes introduced in later patches

commit cd8abed1da91a3250aa4b3857479613a2b446f84
(ARM: OMAP2+: Powerdomain: Remove the need to always have a voltdm
 associated to a pwrdm)

We are no longer restricted in that respect. Further, OPP voltage
information is supposed to be provided by dts information. This needs
to be added in future patches as various voltage modules are converted
to dts.

This also fixes the build breakage for voltagedomains54xx_data.c when just
OMAP5 SoC is enabled: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2764191/
