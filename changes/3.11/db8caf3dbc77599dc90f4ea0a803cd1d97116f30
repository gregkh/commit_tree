gro: should aggregate frames without DF

GRO on IPv4 doesn't aggregate frames if they don't have DF bit set.

Some servers use IP_MTU_DISCOVER/IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE, so linux receivers
are unable to aggregate this kind of traffic.

The right thing to do is to allow aggregation as long as the DF bit has
same value on all segments.

bnx2x LRO does this correctly.
