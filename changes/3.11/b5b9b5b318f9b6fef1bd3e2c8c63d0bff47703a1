Btrfs: fix extent buffer leak after backref walking

commit 47fb091fb787420cd195e66f162737401cce023f(Btrfs: fix unlock after free on rewinded tree blocks)
takes an extra increment on the reference of allocated dummy extent buffer, so now we
cannot free this dummy one, and end up with extent buffer leak.
