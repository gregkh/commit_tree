powerpc/mm: handle hugepage size correctly when invalidating hpte entries

If a hash bucket gets full, we "evict" a more/less random entry from it.
When we do that we don't invalidate the TLB (hpte_remove) because we assume
the old translation is still technically "valid". This implies that when
we are invalidating or updating pte, even if HPTE entry is not valid
we should do a tlb invalidate. With hugepages, we need to pass the correct
actual page size value for tlb invalidation.

This change update the patch 0608d692463598c1d6e826d9dd7283381b4f246c
"powerpc/mm: Always invalidate tlb on hpte invalidate and update" to handle
transparent hugepages correctly.
