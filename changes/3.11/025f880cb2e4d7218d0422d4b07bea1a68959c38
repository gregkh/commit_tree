xhci: check for failed dma pool allocation

Fail and free the container context in case dma_pool_alloc() can't allocate
the raw context data part of it

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that
contain the commit d115b04818e57bdbc7ccde4d0660b15e33013dc8 "USB: xhci:
Support for 64-byte contexts".
