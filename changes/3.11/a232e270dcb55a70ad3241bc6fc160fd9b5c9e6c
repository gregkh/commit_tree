tracing/kprobe: Wait for disabling all running kprobe handlers

Wait for disabling all running kprobe handlers when a kprobe
event is disabled, since the caller, trace_remove_event_call()
supposes that a removing event is disabled completely by
disabling the event.
With this change, ftrace can ensure that there is no running
event handlers after disabling it.
