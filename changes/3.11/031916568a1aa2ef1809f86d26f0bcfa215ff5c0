net: fec: workaround stop tx during errata ERR006358

If the ready bit in the transmit buffer descriptor (TxBD[R])
is previously detected as not set during a prior frame transmission,
then the ENET_TDAR[TDAR] bit is cleared at a later time, even if
additional TxBDs were added to the ring and the ENET_TDAR[TDAR]
bit is set. This results in frames not being transmitted until
there is a 0-to-1 transition on ENET_TDAR[TDAR].

Workarounds:
code can use the transmit frame interrupt flag (ENET_EIR[TXF])
as a method to detect whether the ENET has completed transmission
and the ENET_TDAR[TDAR] has been cleared. If ENET_TDAR[TDAR] is
detected as cleared when packets are queued and waiting for transmit,
then a write to the TDAR bit will restart TxBD processing.

This case main happen when loading is light. A ethernet package may
not send out utile next package put into tx queue.

How to test:
while [ true ]
do
	ping <IP> -s 10000 -w 4
	ping <IP> -s 6000 -w 2
	ping <IP> -s 4000 -w 2
	ping <IP> -s 10000 -w 2
done

You will see below result in overnight test.

6008 bytes from 10.192.242.116: seq=1 ttl=128 time=0.722 ms
4008 bytes from 10.192.242.116: seq=0 ttl=128 time=1001.008 ms
4008 bytes from 10.192.242.116: seq=1 ttl=128 time=1.010 ms
10008 bytes from 10.192.242.116: seq=0 ttl=128 time=0.896 ms

After apply this patch, >1000ms delay disappear.
