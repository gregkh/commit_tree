vfs: make the dentry cache use the lockref infrastructure

This just replaces the dentry count/lock combination with the lockref
structure that contains both a count and a spinlock, and does the
mechanical conversion to use the lockref infrastructure.

There are no semantic changes here, it's purely syntactic.  The
reference lockref implementation uses the spinlock exactly the same way
that the old dcache code did, and the bulk of this patch is just
expanding the internal "d_count" use in the dcache code to use
"d_lockref.count" instead.

This is purely preparation for the real change to make the reference
count updates be lockless during the 3.12 merge window.

[ As with the previous commit, this is a rewritten version of a concept
  originally from Waiman, so credit goes to him, blame for any errors
  goes to me.

  Waiman's patch had some semantic differences for taking advantage of
  the lockless update in dget_parent(), while this patch is
  intentionally a pure search-and-replace change with no semantic
  changes.     - Linus ]
