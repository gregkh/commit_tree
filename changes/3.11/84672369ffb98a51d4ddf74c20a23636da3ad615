Drivers: hv: vmbus: incorrect device name is printed when child device is unregistered

Whenever a device is unregistered in vmbus_device_unregister (drivers/hv/vmbus_drv.c), the device name in the log message may contain garbage as the memory has already been freed by the time pr_info is called. Log example:
 [ 3149.170475] hv_vmbus: child device àõsèè0_5 unregistered

By logging the message just before calling device_unregister, the correct device name is printed:
[ 3145.034652] hv_vmbus: child device vmbus_0_5 unregistered

Also changing register & unregister messages to debug to avoid unnecessarily cluttering the kernel log.
