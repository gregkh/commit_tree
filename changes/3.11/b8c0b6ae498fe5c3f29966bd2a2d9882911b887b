KVM: x86 emulator: convert DIV/IDIV to fastop

Since DIV and IDIV can generate exceptions, we need an additional output
parameter indicating whether an execption has occured.  To avoid increasing
register pressure on i386, we use %rsi, which is already allocated for
the fastop code pointer.

Gleb: added comment about fop usage as exception indication.
