net: ethtool: disambiguate XCVR_* meaning

Add a comment which explains the real meaning of XCVR_INTERNAL (PHY and
Ethernet MAC in the same package/die) and XCVR_EXTERNAL (PHY and
Ethernet MAC in a different package/die). Most if not all of the drivers
setting their transceiver type already do it the way the comment
describes it.
