ARM: dts: OMAP2+: Simplify NAND support

Commit 8c8a777 (ARM: OMAP2+: Add function to read GPMC settings from
device-tree) added a device-tree property "gpmc,device-nand" to indicate
is the GPMC child device is NAND. This commit should have updated the
GPMC NAND documentation (Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/gpmc-nand.txt)
to list the property "gpmc,device-nand" as a required property and also
updated the example. However, this property is redundant and not needed
because the GPMC child device node for NAND is called "nand". Therefore,
remove this property.
