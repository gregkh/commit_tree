NFC: Add basic NCI over SPI

The NFC Forum defines a transport interface based on
Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) for the NFC Controller
Interface (NCI).

This module implements the SPI transport of NCI, calling SPI module
directly to read/write data to NFC controller (NFCC).

NFCC driver should provide functions performing device open and close.
It should also provide functions asserting/de-asserting interruption
to prevent TX/RX race conditions.
NFCC driver can also fix a delay between transactions if needed by
the hardware.
