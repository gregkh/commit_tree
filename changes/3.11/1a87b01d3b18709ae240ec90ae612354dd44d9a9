ARM: shmobile: BOCK-W: add USB support

Register the USB PHY device from bockw_init(), passing the platform  data to it.
Set machine's init_late() method to r8a7778_init_late() in order for [EO]HCI to
get registered too...

Don't forget to add USB PENC0/1 pins to bockw_pinctrl_map[].

The patch has been tested on the BOCK-W board.
