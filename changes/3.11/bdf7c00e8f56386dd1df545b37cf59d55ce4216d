Btrfs: optimize read_block_for_search

This patch does two things, first it only does one call to
btrfs_buffer_uptodate() with the gen specified instead of once with 0 and then
again with gen specified.  The other thing is to call btrfs_read_buffer() on the
buffer we've found instead of dropping it and then calling read_tree_block().
This will keep us from doing yet another radix tree lookup for a buffer we've
already found.  Thanks,
