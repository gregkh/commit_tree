nbd: correct disconnect behavior

Currently, when a disconnect is requested by the user (via NBD_DISCONNECT
ioctl) the return from NBD_DO_IT is undefined (it is usually one of
several error codes).  This means that nbd-client does not know if a
manual disconnect was performed or whether a network error occurred.
Because of this, nbd-client's persist mode (which tries to reconnect after
error, but not after manual disconnect) does not always work correctly.

This change fixes this by causing NBD_DO_IT to always return 0 if a user
requests a disconnect.  This means that nbd-client can correctly either
persist the connection (if an error occurred) or disconnect (if the user
requested it).
