] nilfs2: use atomic64_t type for inodes_count and blocks_count fields in nilfs_root struct

The cp_inodes_count and cp_blocks_count are represented as __le64 type in
on-disk structure (struct nilfs_checkpoint).  But analogous fields in
in-core structure (struct nilfs_root) are represented by atomic_t type.

This patch replaces atomic_t on atomic64_t type in representation of
inodes_count and blocks_count fields in struct nilfs_root.
