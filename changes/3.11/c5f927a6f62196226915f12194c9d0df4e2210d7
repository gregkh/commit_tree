ARM: 7765/1: perf: Record the user-mode PC in the call chain.

With this change, we no longer lose the innermost entry in the user-mode
part of the call chain.  See also the x86 port, which includes the ip.

It's possible to partially work around this problem by post-processing
the data to use the PERF_SAMPLE_IP value, but this works only if the CPU
wasn't in the kernel when the sample was taken.
