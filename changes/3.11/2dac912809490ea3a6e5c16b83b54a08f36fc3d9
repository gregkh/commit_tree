leds: lp55xx: support dynamic channel settings in the device tree structure

Currently, the LP55xx DT structure supports max 3 channels.
However, LP5523 has max 9 channels and LP5562 has 4 channels.
To enhance this constraint, the DT structure has been changed.

 (a) Use the child node for various channel settings instead of fixed array
 (b) Remove 'num_channel' property.
     This value can be retrieved by counting the children node.
 (c) 'chan-name' property supported
 (d) Documentation updates for LP5521 and LP5523
