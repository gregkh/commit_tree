firmware: Avoid deadlock of usermodehelper lock at shutdown

When a system goes to reboot/shutdown, it tries to disable the
usermode helper via usermodehelper_disable().  This might be blocked
when a driver tries to load a firmware beforehand and it's stuck by
some reason.  For example, dell_rbu driver loads the firmware in
non-hotplug mode and waits for user-space clearing the loading sysfs
flag.  If user-space doesn't clear the flag, it waits forever, thus
blocks the reboot, too.

As a workaround, in this patch, the firmware class driver registers a
reboot notifier so that it can abort all pending f/w bufs before
issuing usermodehelper_disable().
