SUNRPC: Fix a potential race in rpc_execute

If the rpc_task is asynchronous, it could theoretically finish executing
on the workqueue it was assigned by rpc_make_runnable() before we get
round to testing RPC_IS_ASYNC() in rpc_execute.

In practice, however, all the existing callers hold a reference to the
rpc_task, so this can't happen today...
