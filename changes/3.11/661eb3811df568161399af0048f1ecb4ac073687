mac80211: fix TX aggregation TID struct leak

Ben reports that kmemleak is saying TX aggregation TID
structs are leaked. Given his workload, I suspect that
they're leaked because stations are destroyed before
their aggregation sessions get a chance to start. Fix
this by simply freeing structs that are not used yet.
