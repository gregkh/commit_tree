ASoC: wm8994: Handle LRCLK inversion for WM8958 and WM1811A

On WM8958 and WM1811A separate control of the LRCLK inversion bit is
available for the DAC and ADC LRCLKs which for compatibility reasons is
done in a new register bit.

Since writes to each scheme have no effect on parts using the other just
always write to both for simplicity.
