drm: Update drm_addmap and drm_mmap to use PAT WC instead of MTRRs

Previously, DRM_FRAME_BUFFER mappings, as well as DRM_REGISTERS
mappings with DRM_WRITE_COMBINING set, resulted in an unconditional
MTRR being added but the actual mappings being created as UC-.

Now these mappings have the MTRR added only if needed, but they will
be mapped with pgprot_writecombine.

The non-WC DRM_REGISTERS case now uses pgprot_noncached instead of
hardcoding the bit twiddling.

The DRM_AGP case is unchanged for now.
