mm: vmscan: do not continue scanning if reclaim was aborted for compaction

Direct reclaim is not aborting to allow compaction to go ahead properly.
do_try_to_free_pages is told to abort reclaim which is happily ignores
and instead increases priority instead until it reaches 0 and starts
shrinking file/anon equally.  This patch corrects the situation by
aborting reclaim when requested instead of raising priority.
