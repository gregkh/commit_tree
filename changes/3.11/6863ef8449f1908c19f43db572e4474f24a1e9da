xfs: correctly map remote attr buffers during removal

If we don't map the buffers correctly (same as for get/set
operations) then the incore buffer lookup will fail. If a block
number matches but a length is wrong, then debug kernels will ASSERT
fail in _xfs_buf_find() due to the length mismatch. Ensure that we
map the buffers correctly by basing the length of the buffer on the
attribute data length rather than the remote block count.
