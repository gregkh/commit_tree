rcu: Move redundant call to note_gp_changes() into called function

The __rcu_process_callbacks() invokes note_gp_changes() immediately
before invoking rcu_check_quiescent_state(), which conditionally
invokes that same function.  This commit therefore eliminates the
call to note_gp_changes() in __rcu_process_callbacks() in favor of
making unconditional to call from rcu_check_quiescent_state() to
note_gp_changes().
