mfd: twl-core: Change TWL6025 references to TWL6032

The TWL6025 was never released beyond sample form and was replaced by
the PhoenixLite range of chips - TWL6032. Change the references to
reference the TWL6032 class and name the registers to twl6032 in line with
an actual released chip name to avoid confusion.

Currently there are no users of TWL6025 in the code.
