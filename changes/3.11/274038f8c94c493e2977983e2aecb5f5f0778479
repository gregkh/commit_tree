tun: Report "persist" flag to userspace

The TUN_PERSIST flag is not reported at all -- both TUNGETIFF, and sysfs
"flags" attribute skip one. Knowing whether a device is persistent or not
is critical for checkpoint-restore, thus I propose to add the read-only
IFF_PERSIST one for this.

Setting this new IFF_PERSIST is hardly possible, as TUNSETIFF doesn't check
for unknown flags being zero and thus there can be trash.
