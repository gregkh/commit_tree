Btrfs: simplify unlink reservations

Dave pointed out a problem where if you filled up a file system as much as
possible you couldn't remove any files.  The whole unlink reservation thing is
convoluted because it tries to guess if it's going to add space to unlink
something or not, and has all these odd uncommented cases where it simply does
not try.  So to fix this I've added a way to conditionally steal from the global
reserve if we can't make our normal reservation.  If we have more than half the
space in the global reserve free we will go ahead and steal from the global
reserve.  With this patch Dave's reproducer now works and I can rm all the files
on the file system.  Thanks,
