[media] usbtv: Add driver for Fushicai USBTV007 video frame grabber

Reverse-engineered driver for cheapo video digitizer, made from observations of
Windows XP driver. The protocol is not yet completely understood, so far we
don't provide any controls, only support a single format out of three and don't
support the audio device.
