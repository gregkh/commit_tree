netfilter: check return code from nla_parse_tested

These are the only calls under net/ that do not check nla_parse_nested()
for its error code, but simply continue execution. If parsing of netlink
attributes fails, we should return with an error instead of continuing.
In nearly all of these calls we have a policy attached, that is being
type verified during nla_parse_nested(), which we would miss checking
for otherwise.
