Add initial PFC support for the r8a7790 SoC.

At this point only GPIO interface is supported, move to
newer interfaces planned as incremental changes.

Original authors is Koji Matsuoka-san, thanks for him
and his team for the heavy lifting. Adjusted by Magnus
to work together with updated code in drivers/pinctrl.
