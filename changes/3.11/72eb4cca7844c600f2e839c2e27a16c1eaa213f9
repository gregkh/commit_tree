ARM: dts: imx6q{dl}: fix the pin conflict between SPI and WEIM

In the imx6q-sabreauto and imx6dl-sabreauto boards,
the pin MX6Q{DL}_PAD_EIM_D19 is used as a GPIO for SPI NOR, but
it is used as a data pin for the WEIM NOR.

In order to fix the conflict, this patch removes the pin from the hog,
and adds a new board-level pinctrl: pinctrl_ecspi1_sabreauto.

The SPI NOR selects this pinctrl_ecspi1_sabreauto when it is enabled.
