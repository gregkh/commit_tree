	    vxlan: add necessary locking on device removal

The problem is that vxlan_dellink(), which is called with RTNL lock
held, tries to flush the workqueue synchronously, but apparently
igmp_join and igmp_leave work need to hold RTNL lock too, therefore we
have a soft lockup!

As suggested by Stephen, probably the flush_workqueue can just be
removed and let the normal refcounting work. The workqueue has a
reference to device and socket, therefore the cleanups should work
correctly.
