[media] mem2mem: set missing v4l2_dev pointer

The m2m-deinterlace, mem2mem_testdev and mx2_emmaprp drivers didn't set
the v4l2_dev pointer in struct video_device, even though a v4l2_device was
registered correctly. These days this v4l2_dev pointer must be set correctly,
so this patch adds that for these three drivers.
