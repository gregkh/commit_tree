powerpc/nvram64: Need return the related error code on failure occurs

When error occurs, need return the related error code to let upper
caller know about it.

ppc_md.nvram_size() can return the error code (e.g. core99_nvram_size()
in 'arch/powerpc/platforms/powermac/nvram.c').

Also set ret value when only need it, so can save structions for normal
cases.
