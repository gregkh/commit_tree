h8300: Mark H83002 and H83048 CPU support broken

arch/h8300/include/asm/io.h supports only H83007 (H8/3006,3007), H83068
(H8/3065,3066,3067,3068,3069), and H8S2678 (H8S/2670,2673,2674R,2675,2676)
CPU types.

Hence disable H83002 (H8/3001,3002,3003) and H83048
(H8/3044,3045,3046,3047,3048,3052) CPU support at the Kconfig level.

This fixes build failures in allmodconfig/allyesconfig builds, as these
always choose the first CPU type (H83002), which was unsupported:

arch/h8300/include/asm/io.h:13:2: error: #error UNKNOWN CPU TYPE
