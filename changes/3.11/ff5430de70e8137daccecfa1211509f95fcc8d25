[media] V4L2: add temporary clock helpers

Typical video devices like camera sensors require an external clock source.
Many such devices cannot even access their hardware registers without a
running clock. These clock sources should be controlled by their consumers.
This should be performed, using the generic clock framework. Unfortunately
so far only very few systems have been ported to that framework. This patch
adds a set of temporary helpers, mimicking the generic clock API, to V4L2.
Platforms, adopting the clock API, should switch to using it. Eventually
this temporary API should be removed.
