ipc/sem.c: cacheline align the semaphore structures

As now each semaphore has its own spinlock and parallel operations are
possible, give each semaphore its own cacheline.

On a i3 laptop, this gives up to 28% better performance:

  #semscale 10 | grep "interleave 2"
  - before:
  Cpus 1, interleave 2 delay 0: 36109234 in 10 secs
  Cpus 2, interleave 2 delay 0: 55276317 in 10 secs
  Cpus 3, interleave 2 delay 0: 62411025 in 10 secs
  Cpus 4, interleave 2 delay 0: 81963928 in 10 secs

  -after:
  Cpus 1, interleave 2 delay 0: 35527306 in 10 secs
  Cpus 2, interleave 2 delay 0: 70922909 in 10 secs <<< + 28%
  Cpus 3, interleave 2 delay 0: 80518538 in 10 secs
  Cpus 4, interleave 2 delay 0: 89115148 in 10 secs <<< + 8.7%

i3, with 2 cores and with hyperthreading enabled.  Interleave 2 in order
use first the full cores.  HT partially hides the delay from cacheline
trashing, thus the improvement is "only" 8.7% if 4 threads are running.
