staging: vt6655: info leak in ioctl

The SCmdLinkStatus struct has a couple holes.  There is one between
->bLink and ->wBSSType, and another between ->abySSID and ->uChannel.

I've added a memset() to initialize the struct to zero.  Since we don't
need to clear abySSID any more so I've removed that memset.  It was
wrong anyway: abySSID has "SSID_MAXLEN + 2" (34) bytes, not
"WLAN_SSID_MAXLEN + 1" (33).
