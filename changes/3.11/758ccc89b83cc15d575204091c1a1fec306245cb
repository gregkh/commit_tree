KVM: x86: drop calling kvm_mmu_zap_all in emulator_fix_hypercall

Quote Gleb's mail:

| Back then kvm->lock protected memslot access so code like:
|
| mutex_lock(&vcpu->kvm->lock);
| kvm_mmu_zap_all(vcpu->kvm);
| mutex_unlock(&vcpu->kvm->lock);
|
| which is what 7aa81cc0 does was enough to guaranty that no vcpu will
| run while code is patched. This is no longer the case and
| mutex_lock(&vcpu->kvm->lock); is gone from that code path long time ago,
| so now kvm_mmu_zap_all() there is useless and the code is incorrect.

So we drop it and it will be fixed later
