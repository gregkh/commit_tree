ipv6: add support of peer address

This patch adds the support of peer address for IPv6. For example, it is
possible to specify the remote end of a 6inY tunnel.
This was already possible in IPv4:
 ip addr add ip1 peer ip2 dev dev1

The peer address is specified with IFA_ADDRESS and the local address with
IFA_LOCAL (like explained in include/uapi/linux/if_addr.h).
Note that the API is not changed, because before this patch, it was not
possible to specify two different addresses in IFA_LOCAL and IFA_REMOTE.
There is a small change for the dump: if the peer is different from ::,
IFA_ADDRESS will contain the peer address instead of the local address.
