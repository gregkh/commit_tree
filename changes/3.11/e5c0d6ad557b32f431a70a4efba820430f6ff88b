target: Add tracepoints for SCSI commands being processed

This patch adds tracepoints to the target code for commands being
received and being completed, which is quite useful for debugging
interactions with initiators. For example, one can do something like the
following to watch commands that are completing unsuccessfully:

    # echo 'scsi_status!=0' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/target/target_cmd_complete/filter
    # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/target/target_cmd_complete/enable

        <run command that fails>

    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
         iscsi_trx-0-1902  [003] ...1 990185.810385: target_cmd_complete: iqn.1993-08.org.debian:01:e51ede6aacfd <- LUN 001 status CHECK CONDITION (sense len 18 / 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 00 00)  0x95 data_length    512  CDB 95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  (TA:SIMPLE C:00)
