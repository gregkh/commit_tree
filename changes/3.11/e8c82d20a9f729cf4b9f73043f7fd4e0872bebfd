cgroup: convert cgroup_cft_commit() to use cgroup_for_each_descendant_pre()

We used root->allcg_list to iterate cgroup hierarchy because at that time
cgroup_for_each_descendant_pre() hasn't been invented.

tj: In cgroup_cfts_commit(), s/@serial_nr/@update_upto/, move the
    assignment right above releasing cgroup_mutex and explain what's
    going on there.
