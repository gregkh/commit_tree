ARM: KVM: don't special case PC when doing an MMIO

Admitedly, reading a MMIO register to load PC is very weird.
Writing PC to a MMIO register is probably even worse. But
the architecture doesn't forbid any of these, and injecting
a Prefetch Abort is the wrong thing to do anyway.

Remove this check altogether, and let the adventurous guest
wander into LaLaLand if they feel compelled to do so.
