Thermal: x86 package temp thermal crash

On systems with no package MSR support this caused crash as there
is a bug in the logic to check presence of DTHERM and PTS feature
together. Added a change so that when there is no PTS support, module
doesn't get loaded. Even if some CPU comes online with the PTS
feature disabled, and other CPUs has this support, this patch
will still prevent such MSR accesses.
