lockdep: remove task argument from debug_check_no_locks_held

The only existing caller to debug_check_no_locks_held calls it
with 'current' as the task, and the freezer needs to call
debug_check_no_locks_held but doesn't already have a current
task pointer, so remove the argument.  It is already assuming
that the current task is relevant by dumping the current stack
trace as part of the warning.

This was originally part of 6aa9707099c (lockdep: check that
no locks held at freeze time) which was reverted in
dbf520a9d7d4.
