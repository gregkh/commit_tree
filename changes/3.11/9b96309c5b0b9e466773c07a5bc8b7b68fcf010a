genl: Fix genl dumpit() locking.

In case of genl-family with parallel ops off, dumpif() callback
is expected to run under genl_lock, But commit def3117493eafd9df
(genl: Allow concurrent genl callbacks.) changed this behaviour
where only first dumpit() op was called under genl-lock.
For subsequent dump, only nlk->cb_lock was taken.
Following patch fixes it by defining locked dumpit() and done()
callback which takes care of genl-locking.
