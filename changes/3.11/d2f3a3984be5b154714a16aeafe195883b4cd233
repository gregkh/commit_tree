rtc: rtc-mxc: remove unnecessary platform_set_drvdata()

The driver core clears the driver data to NULL after device_release or
on probe failure, since commit 0998d063100 ("device-core: Ensure drvdata
= NULL when no driver is bound").  Thus, it is not needed to manually
clear the device driver data to NULL.
