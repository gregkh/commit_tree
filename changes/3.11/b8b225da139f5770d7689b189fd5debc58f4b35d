rsxx: Adding EEH check inside cregs timeout.

Unfortunaly, our CPU register path does not do any kind of
EEH error checking. So to fix this issue, an ioread32 was
added to the CPU register timeout code. This way, the
driver can check to see if the timeout was caused by an EEH
error or not. This is a dummy read.
