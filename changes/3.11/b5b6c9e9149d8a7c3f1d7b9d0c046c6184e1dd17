arm64: Avoid cache flushing in flush_dcache_page()

The flush_dcache_page() function is called when the kernel modified a
page cache page. Since the D-cache on AArch64 does not have aliases
this function can simply mark the page as dirty for later flushing via
set_pte_at()/__sync_icache_dcache() if the page is executable (to ensure
the I-D cache coherency).
