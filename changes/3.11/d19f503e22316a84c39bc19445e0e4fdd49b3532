ACPI / memhotplug: Fix a stale pointer in error path

device->driver_data needs to be cleared when releasing its data,
mem_device, in an error path of acpi_memory_device_add().

The function evaluates the _CRS of memory device objects, and fails
when it gets an unexpected resource or cannot allocate memory.  A
kernel crash or data corruption may occur when the kernel accesses
the stale pointer.
