[SCSI] qla2xxx: Fix a memory leak in an error path of qla2x00_process_els()

Avoid that the fcport structure gets leaked if
bsg_job->request->msgcode == FC_BSG_HST_ELS_NOLOGIN, the fcport
allocation succeeds and the !vha->flags.online branch is taken.
This was detected by Coverity. However, Coverity does not recognize
that all qla2x00_process_els() callers specify either
FC_BSG_RPT_ELS or FC_BSG_HST_ELS_NOLOGIN in the field
bsg_job->request->msgcode and that the value of that field is not
modified inside that function. This results in a false positive
report about a possible memory leak in an error path for
bsg_job->request->msgcode values other than the two mentioned
values.  Make it easy for Coverity (and for humans) to recognize
that there is no fcport leak in the error path by changing the
bsg_job->request->msgcode == FC_BSG_HST_ELS_NOLOGIN test into
bsg_job->request->msgcode != FC_BSG_RPT_ELS.
