bcache: Initialize sectors_dirty when attaching

Previously, dirty_data wouldn't get initialized until the first garbage
collection... which was a bit of a problem for background writeback (as
the PD controller keys off of it) and also confusing for users.

This is also prep work for making background writeback aware of raid5/6
stripes.
