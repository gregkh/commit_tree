nl80211: fix another nl80211_fam.attrbuf race

This is similar to the race Linus had reported, but in this case
it's an older bug: nl80211_prepare_wdev_dump() uses the wiphy
index in cb->args[0] as it is and thus parses the message over
and over again instead of just once because 0 is the first valid
wiphy index. Similar code in nl80211_testmode_dump() correctly
offsets the wiphy_index by 1, do that here as well.
