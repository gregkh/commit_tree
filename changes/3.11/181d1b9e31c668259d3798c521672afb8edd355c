    drm/i915: fix long-standing SNB regression in power consumption after resume

unintentionally also changed the init sequence ordering between
gt_init and gt_reset - we need to reset BIOS damage like leftover
forcewake references before we run our own code. Otherwise we can get
nasty dmesg noise like

[drm:__gen6_gt_force_wake_mt_get] *ERROR* Timed out waiting for forcewake old ack to clear.

again. Since _reset suggests that we first need to have stuff
initialized (which isn't the case here) call it sanitze instead.

While at it also block out the rps disable introduced by the above
commit on ilk: We don't have any knowledge of ilk rps being broken in
similar ways. And the disable functions uses the default hw state
which is only read out when we're enabling rps. So essentially we've
been writing random grabage into that register.
