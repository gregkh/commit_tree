ocfs2: fix mutex_unlock and possible memory leak in ocfs2_remove_btree_range

In ocfs2_remove_btree_range, when calling ocfs2_lock_refcount_tree and
ocfs2_prepare_refcount_change_for_del failed, it goes to out and then
tries to call mutex_unlock without mutex_lock before.  And when calling
ocfs2_reserve_blocks_for_rec_trunc failed, it should free ref_tree
before return.
