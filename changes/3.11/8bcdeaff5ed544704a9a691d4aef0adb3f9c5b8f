packet: restore packet statistics tp_packets to include drops

getsockopt PACKET_STATISTICS returns tp_packets + tp_drops. Commit
ee80fbf301 ("packet: account statistics only in tpacket_stats_u")
cleaned up the getsockopt PACKET_STATISTICS code.
This also changed semantics. Historically, tp_packets included
tp_drops on return. The commit removed the line that adds tp_drops
into tp_packets.

This patch reinstates the old semantics.
