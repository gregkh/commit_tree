drm/i915: add batch bo to i915_add_request()

In order to track down a batch buffer and context which
caused the ring to hang, store reference to bo into the request struct.
Request can also cause gpu to hang after the batch in the flush section
in the ring. To detect this add start of the flush portion offset into the
request.
