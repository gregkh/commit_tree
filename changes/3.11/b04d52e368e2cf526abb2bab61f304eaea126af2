tracing/kprobes: Turn trace_probe->files into list_head

I think that "ftrace_event_file *trace_probe[]" complicates the
code for no reason, turn it into list_head to simplify the code.
enable_trace_probe() no longer needs synchronize_sched().

This needs the extra sizeof(list_head) memory for every attached
ftrace_event_file, hopefully not a problem in this case.
