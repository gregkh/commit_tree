net_sched: make dev_trans_start return vlan's real dev trans_start

Vlan devices are LLTX and don't update their own trans_start, so if
dev_trans_start has to be called with a vlan device then 0 or a stale
value will be returned. Currently the bonding is the only such user, and
it's needed for proper arp monitoring when the slaves are vlans.
Fix this by extracting the vlan's real device trans_start.
