ARM: elf: add new hwcap for identifying atomic ldrd/strd instructions

CPUs implementing LPAE have atomic ldrd/strd instructions, meaning that
userspace software can avoid having to use the exclusive variants of
these instructions if they wish.

This patch advertises the atomicity of these instructions via the
hwcaps, so userspace can detect this CPU feature.
