iscsi-target: Fix iscsit_add_reject* usage for iser

This patch changes iscsit_add_reject() + iscsit_add_reject_from_cmd()
usage to not sleep on iscsi_cmd->reject_comp to address a free-after-use
usage bug in v3.10 with iser-target code.

It saves ->reject_reason for use within iscsit_build_reject() so the
correct value for both transport cases.  It also drops the legacy
fail_conn parameter usage throughput iscsi-target code and adds
two iscsit_add_reject_cmd() and iscsit_reject_cmd helper functions,
along with various small cleanups.

(v2: Re-enable target_put_sess_cmd() to be called from
     iscsit_add_reject_from_cmd() for rejects invoked after
     target_get_sess_cmd() has been called)
