drm/nva3-/disp: fix hda eld writing, needs to be padded

Commits 0a9e2b959 (drm/nvd0/disp: move HDA codec setup to core) and
a4feaf4ea (drm/nva3/disp: move hda codec handling to core) moved code
around but neglected to fill data up to 0x60 as before. This caused
/proc/asound/cardN/eld#3.0 to show eld_valid as 0. With this patch, that
file is again populated with the correct data.
