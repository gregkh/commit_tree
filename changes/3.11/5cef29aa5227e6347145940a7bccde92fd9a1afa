drm: fix fb leak in setcrtc

Drivers are allowed (actually have to) disable unrelated crtcs in
their ->set_config callback (when we steal all the connectors from
that crtc). If they do that they'll clear crtc->fb to NULL.

Which results in a refcount leak, since the drm core is keeping track
of that reference.

To fix this track the old fb of all crtcs and adjust references for
all of them. Of course, since we only hold an additional reference for
the fb for the current crtc we need to increase refcounts before we
drop the old one.

This approach has the benefit that it inches us a bit closer to an
atomic modeset world, where we want to update the config of all crtcs
in one step.

This regression has been introduce in the framebuffer refcount
conversion, specifically in
