net-rps: fixes for rps flow limit

Caught by sparse:
- __rcu: missing annotation to sd->flow_limit
- __user: direct access in cpumask_scnprintf

Also
- add endline character when printing bitmap if room in buffer
- avoid bucket overflow by reducing FLOW_LIMIT_HISTORY

The last item warrants some explanation. The hashtable buckets are
subject to overflow if FLOW_LIMIT_HISTORY is larger than or equal
to bucket size, since all packets may end up in a single bucket. The
current (rather arbitrary) history value of 256 happens to match the
buffer size (u8).

As a result, with a single flow, the first 128 packets are accepted
(correct), the second 128 packets dropped (correct) and then the
history[] array has filled, so that each subsequent new packet
causes an increment in the bucket for new_flow plus a decrement
for old_flow: a steady state.

This is fine if packets are dropped, as the steady state goes away
as soon as a mix of traffic reappears. But, because the 256th packet
overflowed the bucket to 0: no packets are dropped.

Instead of explicitly adding an overflow check, this patch changes
FLOW_LIMIT_HISTORY to never be able to overflow a single bucket.
