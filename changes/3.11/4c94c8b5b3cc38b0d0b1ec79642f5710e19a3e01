ARM: tegra: update device trees for USB binding rework

This patch updates all Tegra board files so that they contain all the
properties required by the updated USB DT binding. Note that this patch
only adds the new properties and does not yet remove the old properties,
in order to maintain bisectability. The old properties will be removed
once the driver has been updated to assume the new bindings.

match schematic, avoided duplicate regulator-name on Whistler.]
