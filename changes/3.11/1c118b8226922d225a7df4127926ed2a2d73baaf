KVM: MMU: avoid fast page fault fixing mmio page fault

Currently, fast page fault incorrectly tries to fix mmio page fault when
the generation number is invalid (spte.gen != kvm.gen).  It then returns
to guest to retry the fault since it sees the last spte is nonpresent.
This causes an infinite loop.

Since fast page fault only works for direct mmu, the issue exists when
1) tdp is enabled. It is only triggered only on AMD host since on Intel host
   the mmio page fault is recognized as ept-misconfig whose handler call
   fault-page path with error_code = 0

2) guest paging is disabled. Under this case, the issue is hardly discovered
   since paging disable is short-lived and the sptes will be invalid after
   memslot changed for 150 times

Fix it by filtering out MMIO page faults in page_fault_can_be_fast.
