ifb: fix rcu_sched self-detected stalls

According to the commit 16b0dc29c1af9df341428f4c49ada4f626258082
(dummy: fix rcu_sched self-detected stalls)

Eric Dumazet fix the problem in dummy, but the ifb will occur the
same problem like the dummy modules.

Trying to "modprobe ifb numifbs=30000" triggers :

INFO: rcu_sched self-detected stall on CPU

After this splat, RTNL is locked and reboot is needed.

We must call cond_resched() to avoid this, even holding RTNL.
