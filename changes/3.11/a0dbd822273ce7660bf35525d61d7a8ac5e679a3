l2tp: make datapath resilient to packet loss when sequence numbers enabled

If L2TP data sequence numbers are enabled and reordering is not
enabled, data reception stops if a packet is lost since the kernel
waits for a sequence number that is never resent. (When reordering is
enabled, data reception restarts when the reorder timeout expires.) If
no reorder timeout is set, we should count the number of in-sequence
packets after the out-of-sequence (OOS) condition is detected, and reset
sequence number state after a number of such packets are received.

For now, the number of in-sequence packets while in OOS state which
cause the sequence number state to be reset is hard-coded to 5. This
could be configurable later.
