usb: chipidea: ci13xxx_imx: fix error path

If usbmisc_ops->post() fails it should point the error path to release all
previously acquired resources, so adjust it to call ci13xxx_remove_device().

While at it, remove the unnecessary 'plat_ci' indirection, as we can directly
use the private structure.
