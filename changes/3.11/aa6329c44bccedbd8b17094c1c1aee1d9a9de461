ACPICA: Move _PRT repair into the standard complex repair module

Moved this longstanding repair to the relatively new predefined
name repair module. ACPICA BZ 783. Lv Zheng.

No functional change.  This change simply moves the repair code from
where it was originally implemented to the (more recent) repair
module where it now belongs.
