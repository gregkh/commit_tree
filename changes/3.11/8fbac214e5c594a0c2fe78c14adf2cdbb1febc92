ARM: 7787/1: virt: ensure visibility of __boot_cpu_mode

Secondary CPUs write to __boot_cpu_mode with caches disabled, and thus a
cached value of __boot_cpu_mode may be incoherent with that in memory.
This could lead to a failure to detect mismatched boot modes.

This patch adds flushing to ensure that writes by secondaries to
__boot_cpu_mode are made visible before we test against it.
