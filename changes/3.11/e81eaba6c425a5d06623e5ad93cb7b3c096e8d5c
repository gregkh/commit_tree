staging: comedi: dt9812: convert digital in subdevice to (*insn_bits)

Currently the (*insn_read) function for the digital input subdevice
returns the state for a single channel. It's more efficent to use
the (*insn_bits) function and return the state for all the channels.

The comedi core can use the (*insn_bits) to emulate the (*insn_read)
if needed.
