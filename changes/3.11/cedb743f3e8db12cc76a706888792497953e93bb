bonding: don't call alb_set_slave_mac_addr() while atomic

alb_set_slave_mac_addr() sets the mac address in alb mode via
dev_set_mac_address(), which might sleep. It's called from
alb_handle_addr_collision_on_attach() in atomic context (under
read_lock(bond->lock)), thus triggering a bug.

Fix this by moving the lock inside alb_handle_addr_collision_on_attach().

v1->v2:
As Nikolay Aleksandrov noticed, we can drop the bond->lock completely.
Also, use bond_slave_has_mac(), when possible.
