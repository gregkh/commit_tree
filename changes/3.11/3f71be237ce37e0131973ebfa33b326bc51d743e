ARM: arch_timer: stop virtual timer when booted in HYP mode

When booting the kernel, a bootloader could have left the virtual
timer ticking away, potentially generating interrupts. This could
be troublesome if the user of the virtual timer is not careful
when enabling the interrupt.

In order to avoid any surprise, stop the virtual timer from
interrupting us when booted in HYP mode, as we'll use the physical
timer in this case.
