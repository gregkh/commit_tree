xen / ACPI / sleep: Register an acpi_suspend_lowlevel callback.

We piggyback on "x86/acpi: Provide registration for acpi_suspend_lowlevel."
to register a Xen version of the callback. The callback does not
do anything special - except it omits the x86_acpi_suspend_lowlevel.

This is necessary b/c during suspend the generic code tries to write
cr3 values that clashes with what the hypervisor has set up for the guest.
