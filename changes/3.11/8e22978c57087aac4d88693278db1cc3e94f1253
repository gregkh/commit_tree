usb: chipidea: drop "13xxx" infix

"ci13xxx" is bad for at least the following reasons:
  * people often mistype it
  * it doesn't add any informational value to the names it's used in
  * it needlessly attracts mail filters

This patch replaces it with "ci_hdrc", "ci_udc" or "ci_hw", depending
on the situation. Modules with ci13xxx prefix are also renamed accordingly
and aliases are added for compatibility. Otherwise, no functional changes.
