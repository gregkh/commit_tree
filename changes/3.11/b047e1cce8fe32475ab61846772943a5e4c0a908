ASoC: ac97: Support multi-platform AC'97

Currently we can only have a single platform built in with AC'97 support
due to the use of a global variable to provide the bus operations. Fix
this by making that variable a pointer and having the bus drivers set the
operations prior to registering.

This is not a particularly good or nice approach but it avoids blocking
multiplatform and a real fix involves fixing the fairly deep problems
with AC'97 support - we should be converting it to a real bus.
