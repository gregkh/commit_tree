ptrace/arm: revert "hw_breakpoints: Fix racy access to ptrace breakpoints"

This reverts commit bf0b8f4b55e5 ("hw_breakpoints: Fix racy access to
ptrace breakpoints").

The patch was fine but we can no longer race with SIGKILL after commit
9899d11f6544 ("ptrace: ensure arch_ptrace/ptrace_request can never race
with SIGKILL"), the __TASK_TRACED tracee can't be woken up and
->ptrace_bps[] can't go away.
