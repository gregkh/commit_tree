uml: Fix which_tmpdir failure when /dev/shm is a symlink, and in other edge cases

which_tmpdir did the wrong thing if /dev/shm was a symlink (e.g., to /run/shm),
if there were multiple mounts on top of each other, if the mount(s) were
obscured by a later mount, or if /dev/shm was a prefix of another mount point.
This fixes these cases. Applies to 3.9.6.
