jbd2: optimize jbd2_journal_force_commit

Current implementation of jbd2_journal_force_commit() is suboptimal because
result in empty and useless commits. But callers just want to force and wait
any unfinished commits. We already have jbd2_journal_force_commit_nested()
which does exactly what we want, except we are guaranteed that we do not hold
journal transaction open.
