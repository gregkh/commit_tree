mm: vmscan: decide whether to compact the pgdat based on reclaim progress

In the past, kswapd makes a decision on whether to compact memory after
the pgdat was considered balanced.  This more or less worked but it is
late to make such a decision and does not fit well now that kswapd makes
a decision whether to exit the zone scanning loop depending on reclaim
progress.

This patch will compact a pgdat if at least the requested number of
pages were reclaimed from unbalanced zones for a given priority.  If any
zone is currently balanced, kswapd will not call compaction as it is
expected the necessary pages are already available.
