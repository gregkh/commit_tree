htb: reorder struct htb_class fields for performance

htb_class structures are big, and source of false sharing on SMP.

By carefully splitting them in two parts, we can improve performance.

I got 9 % performance increase on a 24 threads machine, with 200
concurrent netperf in TCP_RR mode, using a HTB hierarchy of 4 classes.
