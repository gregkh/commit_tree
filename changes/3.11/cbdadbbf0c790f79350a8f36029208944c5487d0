virtio_net: fix race in RX VQ processing

virtio net called virtqueue_enable_cq on RX path after napi_complete, so
with NAPI_STATE_SCHED clear - outside the implicit napi lock.
This violates the requirement to synchronize virtqueue_enable_cq wrt
virtqueue_add_buf.  In particular, used event can move backwards,
causing us to lose interrupts.
In a debug build, this can trigger panic within START_USE.

Jason Wang reports that he can trigger the races artificially,
by adding udelay() in virtqueue_enable_cb() after virtio_mb().

However, we must call napi_complete to clear NAPI_STATE_SCHED before
polling the virtqueue for used buffers, otherwise napi_schedule_prep in
a callback will fail, causing us to lose RX events.

To fix, call virtqueue_enable_cb_prepare with NAPI_STATE_SCHED
set (under napi lock), later call virtqueue_poll with
NAPI_STATE_SCHED clear (outside the lock).
