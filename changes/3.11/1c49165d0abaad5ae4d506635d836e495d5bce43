drm/radeon: add support for MC/VM setup on CIK (v6)

The vm callbacks are the same as the SI ones right now
(same regs and bits). We could share the SI variants, and
I may yet do that, but I figured I would add CIK specific
ones for now in case we need to change anything.

V2: add documentation, minor fixes.
V3: integrate vram offset fixes for APUs
V4: enable 2 level VM PTs
V5: index SH_MEM_* regs properly
V6: add ib_parse()
