timekeeping: Indicate that clock was set in the pvclock gtod notifier

If the clock was set (stepped), set the action parameter to functions
in the pvclock gtod notifier chain to non-zero.  This allows the
callee to only do work if the clock was stepped.

This will be used on Xen as the synchronization of the Xen wallclock
to the control domain's (dom0) system time will be done with this
notifier and updating on every timer tick is unnecessary and too
expensive.
