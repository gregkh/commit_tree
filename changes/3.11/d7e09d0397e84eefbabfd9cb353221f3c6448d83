staging: add Lustre file system client support

Lustre is the most deployed distributed file system
in the HPC (High Performance Computing) world. The patch
adds its client side support.

The code is not very clean and needs to live in drivers/staging
for some time for continuing cleanup work. See
drivers/staging/lustre/TODO for details.

The code is based on Lustre master commit faefbfc04
