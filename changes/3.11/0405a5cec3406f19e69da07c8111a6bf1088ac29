pstore/ram: avoid atomic accesses for ioremapped regions

For persistent RAM outside of main memory, the memory may have limitations
on supported accesses. For internal RAM on highbank platform exclusive
accesses are not supported and will hang the system. So atomic_cmpxchg
cannot be used. This commit uses spinlock protection for buffer size and
start updates on ioremapped regions instead.
