cgroup: remove cgroup->count and use

cgroup->count tracks the number of css_sets associated with the cgroup
and used only to verify that no css_set is associated when the cgroup
is being destroyed.  It's superflous as the destruction path can
simply check whether cgroup->cset_links is empty instead.

Drop cgroup->count and check ->cset_links directly from
cgroup_destroy_locked().
