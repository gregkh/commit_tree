modules: don't fail to load on unknown parameters.

Although parameters are supposed to be part of the kernel API, experimental
parameters are often removed.  In addition, downgrading a kernel might cause
previously-working modules to fail to load.

On balance, it's probably better to warn, and load the module anyway.
This may let through a typo, but at least the logs will show it.
