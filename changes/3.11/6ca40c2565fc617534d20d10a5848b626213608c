rapidio: change endpoint device name format

Change endpoint device name format to use a component tag value instead of
device destination ID.

RapidIO specification defines a component tag to be a unique identifier
for devices in a network.  RapidIO switches already use component tag as
part of their device name and also use it for device identification when
processing error management event notifications.

Forming an endpoint's device name using its component tag instead of
destination ID allows to keep sysfs device directories unchanged in case
if a routing process dynamically changes endpoint's destination ID as a
result of route optimization.

This change should not affect any existing users because a valid device
destination ID always should be obtained by reading "destid" attribute and
not by parsing device name.

This patch also removes switchid member from struct rio_switch because it
simply duplicates the component tag and does not have other use than in
device name generation.
