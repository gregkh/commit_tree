HID: wiimote: lock DRM mode during debugfs overwrite

If we write a DRM mode via debugfs, we shouldn't allow normal operations
to overwrite this DRM mode. This is important if we want to debug
3rd-party devices and we want to see what data is sent on each mode.

If we write NULL/0 as DRM, the lock is removed again so the best matching
DRM is chosen by wiimote core.
