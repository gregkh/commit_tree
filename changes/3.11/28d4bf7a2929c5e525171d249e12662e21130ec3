ARM: mm: clean up membank size limit checks

This patch cleans up the highmem sanity check code by simplifying the range
checks with a pre-calculated size_limit.  This patch should otherwise have no
functional impact on behavior.

This patch also removes a redundant (bank->start < vmalloc_limit) check, since
this is already covered by the !highmem condition.
