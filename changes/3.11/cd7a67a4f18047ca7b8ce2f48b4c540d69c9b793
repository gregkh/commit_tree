[media] drxk_hard: Don't use CamelCase

X-Patchwork-Delegate: mchehab@redhat.com
Thare are lots of CamelCase warnings produced by checkpatch.pl.
This weren't fixed at the time the driver got submitted due
to the lack of manpower do to such cleanup.
Now that I have one script that automates this task, cleans
it. That makes the driver almost checkpatch-compliant,
except for 80 column warnings.
