NFS: Client implementation of Labeled-NFS

This patch implements the client transport and handling support for labeled
NFS. The patch adds two functions to encode and decode the security label
recommended attribute which makes use of the LSM hooks added earlier. It also
adds code to grab the label from the file attribute structures and encode the
label to be sent back to the server.
