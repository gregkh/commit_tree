staging/lustre/debug: quiet noisy console error messages

Quiet a number of overly noisy and unhelpful console error
messages.  Improve the format of other nearby errors.

In the case of {lod,lov}_fix_desc_stripe_size(), this doesn't
even need a console message unless it is actually changing
some stripe size that is below the minimum.  Typically it is
only zero and is being bumped up to the default value.

[picked lov part for upstream kernel submission]
