ipc: move locking out of ipcctl_pre_down_nolock

This function currently acquires both the rw_mutex and the rcu lock on
successful lookups, leaving the callers to explicitly unlock them,
creating another two level locking situation.

Make the callers (including those that still use ipcctl_pre_down())
explicitly lock and unlock the rwsem and rcu lock.
