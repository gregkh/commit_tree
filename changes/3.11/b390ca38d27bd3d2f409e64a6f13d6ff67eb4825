dlm: clear correct bit during sctp init failure handling

We should be testing and cleaing the init pending bit because later
when sctp_init_assoc is recalled it will be checking that it is not set
and set the bit.

We do not want to touch CF_CONNECT_PENDING here because we will queue
swork and process_send_sockets will then call the connect_action function.
