MIPS: Move cop2 save/restore to switch_to()

Move the common code for saving and restoring platform specific COP2
registers to switch_to(). This will make supporting new platforms (like
Netlogic XLP) easier.

The platform specific COP2 definitions are to be specified in
asm/processor.h and in asm/cop2.h.
