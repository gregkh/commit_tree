drm/i915: WA: FBC Render Nuke.

WaFbcNukeOn3DBlt for IVB, HSW.

According BSPec: "Workaround: Do not enable Render Command Streamer tracking for FBC.
Instead insert a LRI to address 0x50380 with data 0x00000004 after the PIPE_CONTROL that
follows each render submission."

v2: Chris noticed that flush_domains check was missing here and also suggested to do
    LRI only when fbc is enabled. To avoid do a I915_READ on every flush lets use the
    module parameter check.

v3: Adding Wa name as Damien suggested.

v4: Ville noticed VLV doesn't support fbc at all and comment came wrong from spec.

v5: Ville noticed than on blt a Cache Clean LRI should be used instead the Nuke one.

v6: Check for flush domain on blt (by Ville).
    Check for scanout dirty (by Chris).

v7: Apply proper fbc_dirty implemented by Chris.

v8: remove unused variables.
