    drm/i915: Add bit field to record which pins have received HPD events (v3)

added a bit field for hotplug event tracking. There ended up being three
different v3 of the patch: [1], [2], and [3]. Apparently [1] was the
correct one, but some frankenstein combination of the three got
committed, which reversed the logic for setting the hotplug bits and
misplaced a continue statement, skipping the hotplug irq storm handling
altogether.

This lead to broken hotplug detection, bisected to

    drm/i915: Only reprobe display on encoder which has received an HPD event (v2)

which uses the incorrectly set hotplug event bits.

Fix the mess.
