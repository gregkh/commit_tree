drivers: avoid format string in dev_set_name

Calling dev_set_name with a single paramter causes it to be handled as a
format string.  Many callers are passing potentially dynamic string
content, so use "%s" in those cases to avoid any potential accidents,
including wrappers like device_create*() and bdi_register().
