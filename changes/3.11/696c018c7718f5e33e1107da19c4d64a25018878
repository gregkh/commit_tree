f2fs: add remount_fs callback support

Add the f2fs_remount function call which will be used
during the filesystem remounting. This function
will help us to change the mount options specific to
f2fs.

Also modify the f2fs background_gc mount option, which
will allow the user to dynamically trun on/off the
garbage collection in f2fs based on the background_gc
value. If background_gc=on, Garbage collection will
be turned off & if background_gc=off, Garbage collection
will be truned on.

By default the garbage collection is on in f2fs.

Change Log:
v2: Incorporated the review comments by Gu Zheng.
    Removing the restore part for VFS flags
    Updating comments with proper flag conditions
    Display GC background option as ON/OFF
    Revised conditions to stop GC in case of remount

v1: Initial changes for adding remount_fs callback
support.
