md/raid10: check In_sync flag in 'enough()'.

It isn't really enough to check that the rdev is present, we need to
also be sure that the device is still In_sync.

Doing this requires using rcu_dereference to access the rdev, and
holding the rcu_read_lock() to ensure the rdev doesn't disappear while
we look at it.
