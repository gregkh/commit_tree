pinctrl: pinctrl-single: enhance to configure multiple pins of different modules

Add support to configure multiple pins in each register, existing
implementation added by [1] does not support full fledge multiple pin
configuration in single register, reports a pin clash when different
modules configure different bits of same register. The issue reported
and discussed here
http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg235213.html

With pinctrl-single,bits-per-mux property specified, use function-mask
property to find out number pins to configure. Allocate and register
pin control functions based sub mask.

Tested on da850/omap-l138 EVM.
does not support variable submask for pins.
does not support pinconf.
