sysfs_notify is only possible on file attributes

If sysfs_notify is called on a binary attribute, bad things can
happen, so prevent it.

Note, no in-kernel usage of this is currently present, but in the
future, it's good to be safe.

Changes in V2:
- Also ignore sysfs_notify on dirs, links
- Use WARN_ON rather than silently failing
- Compiled and tested (huge apologies about first submission)
