nohz_full: Document additional restrictions

This commit calls out the potential for slowing the tick even when there
are multiple runnable processes per CPU,  It also points out that current
mainlined version keeps the tick going on at least one CPU even when all
CPUs are otherwise idle.  Finally, it notes the need for a 1-HZ tick in
order to calculate CPU load, maintain sched average, compute CFS entity
vruntime, compute avenrun, and carry out load balancing.
