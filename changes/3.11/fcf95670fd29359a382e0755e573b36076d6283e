watchdog: core: don't try to stop device if not running

A watchdog device may be stopped from userspace using WDIOC_SETOPTIONS
ioctl and flag WDIOS_DISABLECARD. If the device is closed after this
operation, watchdog_release() is called and status bits checked for
stopping it. Besides, if the device has not been unregistered a critical
message "watchdog did not stop!" is printed, although the ioctl may have
successfully stopped it already.

Without the patch a user application sample code like this will successfully
stop the watchdog, but the kernel will output the message
"watchdog did not stop!":

	wd_fd = open("/dev/watchdog", O_RDWR);

	flags = WDIOS_DISABLECARD;
	ioctl(wd_fd, WDIOC_SETOPTIONS, &flags);

	close(wd_fd);
