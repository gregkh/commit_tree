metag: checksum.h: fix carry in csum_tcpudp_nofold

In csum_tcpudp_nofold, add 1 if the carry bit is set after adding the
destination IP address (32 bits) to the checksum (16 bits).

The lack of carry handling for this particular addition meant that a
destination address of *.*.255.255 (e.g. certain broadcasts) sometimes
resulted in an incorrect checksum. This bug has been present in the Meta
port since the code was written in the 2.4 days.
