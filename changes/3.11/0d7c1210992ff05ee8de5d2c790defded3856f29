irqchip: Add irqchip_init dummy function

We add an empty irqchip_init dummy function for cases in which
CONFIG_IRQCHIP is not used. In these cases irqchip.c is not compiled,
but a funtion call may still be present in architecture code, that in
runtime doesn't get hit.

E.g. this is needed in the arch/arm/mach-shmobile/intc-r8a7740.c
interrupt setup code where OF use and non OF us is both handled in one
file.
