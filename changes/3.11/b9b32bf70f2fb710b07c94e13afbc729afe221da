ARM: use linker magic for vectors and vector stubs

Use linker magic to create the vectors and vector stubs: we can tell the
linker to place them at an appropriate VMA, but keep the LMA within the
kernel.  This gets rid of some unnecessary symbol manipulation, and
have the linker calculate the relocations appropriately.
