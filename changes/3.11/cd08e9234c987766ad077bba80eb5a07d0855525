sched: Fix memory leakage in build_sched_groups()

In build_sched_groups() we don't need to call get_group() for cpus
which are already covered in previous iterations. Calling get_group()
would mark the group used and eventually leak it since we wouldn't
connect it and not find it again to free it.

This will happen only in cases where sg->cpumask contained more than
one cpu (For any topology level). This patch would free sg's memory
for all cpus leaving the group leader as the group isn't marked used
now.
