jbd2: Fix oops in jbd2_journal_file_inode()

Commit 0713ed0cde76438d05849f1537d3aab46e099475 added
jbd2_journal_file_inode() call into ext4_block_zero_page_range().
However that function gets called from truncate path and thus inode
needn't have jinode attached - that happens in ext4_file_open() but
the file needn't be ever open since mount. Calling
jbd2_journal_file_inode() without jinode attached results in the oops.

We fix the problem by attaching jinode to inode also in ext4_truncate()
and ext4_punch_hole() when we are going to zero out partial blocks.
