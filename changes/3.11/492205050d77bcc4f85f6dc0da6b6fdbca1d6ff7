net: Add EMAC ethernet driver found on Allwinner A10 SoC's

The Allwinner A10 has an ethernet controller that seem to be developped
internally by them.

The exact feature set of this controller is unknown, since there is no
public documentation for this IP, and this driver is mostly the one
published by Allwinner that has been heavily cleaned up.
