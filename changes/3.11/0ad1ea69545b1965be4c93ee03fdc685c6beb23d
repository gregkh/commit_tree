Revert "Revert "Revert "staging/lustre: drop CONFIG_BROKEN dependency"""

This reverts commit ee04fd11f11fb67ff0ae482a6710f97f499c19e2.

How many times can we do this...

Not all the world is x86-64, breaking other arch builds, especially for
weeks at a time, isn't acceptable at all.

So, it's nice to get this code into the tree, just don't build it as
it's obviously not ready for "real world" systems :(
