net/mlx5_core: Support MANAGE_PAGES and QUERY_PAGES firmware command changes

In the previous QUERY_PAGES command version we used one command to get the
required amount of boot, init and post init pages.  The new version uses the
op_mod field to specify whether the query is for the required amount of boot,
init or post init pages. In addition the output field size for the required
amount of pages increased from 16 to 32 bits.

In MANAGE_PAGES command the input_num_entries and output_num_entries fields
sizes changed from 16 to 32 bits and the PAS tables offset changed to 0x10.

In the pages request event the num_pages field also changed to 32 bits.

In the HCA-capabilities-layout the size and location of max_qp_mcg field has
been changed to support 24 bits.

This patch isn't compatible with firmware versions < 5; however, it  turns out that the
first GA firmware we will publish will not support previous versions so this should be OK.
