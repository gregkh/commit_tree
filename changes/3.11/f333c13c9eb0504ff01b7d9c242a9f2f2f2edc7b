ARM: dts: msm: Fix merge resolution

Commit e45600107b (Merge tag 'msm-cleanup-for-3.11' of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davidb/linux-msm into
next/cleanup) incorrectly resolved a merge conflict, resulting in a
node address that doesn't match the register address.

Fix this node address.
