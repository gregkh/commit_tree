tg3: Split APE driver state change out of boot reset signature update

Unlike the boot signature that needs to be set before every reset, the
ape state only needs to be updated to tell the firmware that the driver
is now taking/releasing control of the hardware. Move the calls to
tg3_ape_driver_state_change() to better, more appropriate places.

Also, the firmware does not distinguish between SUSPEND and START states
anymore. Remove the SUSPEND case in the switch.
