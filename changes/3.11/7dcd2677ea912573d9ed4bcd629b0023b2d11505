drm/i915: fix long-standing SNB regression in power consumption after resume v2

This patch fixes regression in power consumtion of sandy bridge gpu, which
exists since v3.6 Sometimes after resuming from s2ram gpu starts thinking that
it's extremely busy. After that it never reaches rc6 state.

Bug exists since kernel v3.6:

    drm/i915: load boot context at driver init time

For some reason RC6 is already enabled at the beginning of resuming process.
Following initliaztion breaks some internal state and confuses RPS engine.
This patch disables RC6 at the beginnig of resume and initialization.

I've rearranged initialization sequence, because intel_disable_gt_powersave()
needs initialized force_wake_get/put and some locks from the dev_priv.

Note: The culprit in the initialization sequence seems to be the write
to MBCTL added in the above mentioned commit. The first version of
this patch just held a forcewake reference across the clock gating
init functions, which seems to have been enought to gather quite a few
positive test reports. But since that smelled a bit like ad-hoc
duct-tape v2 now just disables rps/rc6 across the entire hw setup.
