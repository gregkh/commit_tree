mm/page_alloc: insert memory barriers to allow async update of pcp batch and high

Introduce pageset_update() to perform a safe transision from one set of
pcp->{batch,high} to a new set using memory barriers.

This ensures that batch is always set to a safe value (1) prior to
updating high, and ensure that high is fully updated before setting the
real value of batch.  It avoids ->batch ever rising above ->high.
