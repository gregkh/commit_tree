[media] tveeprom: remove v4l2-chip-ident.h include

Replace the V4L2_IDENT_* usage with tveeprom-specific defines. This header
is deprecated, so those defines shouldn't be used anymore.
The em28xx driver is the only one that uses the tveeprom audio_processor
field, so that has been updated to use the new tveeprom AUDPROC define.
