s390/kvm: Provide a way to prevent reentering SIE

Lets provide functions to prevent KVM from reentering SIE and
to kick cpus out of SIE. We cannot use the common kvm_vcpu_kick code,
since we need to kick out guests in places that hold architecture
specific locks (e.g. pgste lock) which might be necessary on the
other cpus - so no waiting possible.

So lets provide a bit in a private field of the sie control block
that acts as a gate keeper, after we claimed we are in SIE.
Please note that we do not reuse prog0c, since we want to access
that bit without atomic ops.
