IB/srp: Maintain a single connection per I_T nexus

An SRP target is required to maintain a single connection between
initiator and target.  This means that if the 'add_target' attribute
is used to create a second connection to a target, the first
connection will be logged out and that the SCSI error handler will
kick in.  The SCSI error handler will cause the SRP initiator to
reconnect, which will cause I/O over the second connection to fail.
Avoid such ping-pong behavior by disabling relogins.

If reconnecting manually is necessary, that is possible by deleting
and recreating an rport via sysfs.
