xfs: xfs_ifree doesn't need to modify the inode buffer

Long ago, bulkstat used to read inodes directly from the backing
buffer for speed. This had the unfortunate problem of being cache
incoherent with unlinks, and so xfs_ifree() had to mark the inode
as free directly in the backing buffer. bulkstat was changed some
time ago to use inode cache coherent lookups, and so will never see
unlinked inodes in it's lookups. Hence xfs_ifree() does not need to
touch the inode backing buffer anymore.
