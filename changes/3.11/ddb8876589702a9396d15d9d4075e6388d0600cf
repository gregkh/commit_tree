IB/qib: Convert opcode counters to per-context

This fix changes the opcode relative counters for receive to per
context.

Profiling has shown that when mulitple contexts are being used there
is a lot of cache activity associated with these counters.

The code formerly kept these counters per port, but only provided the
interface to read per HCA.  This patch converts the read of counters
to per HCA and adds the debugfs hooks to be able to read the file as a
sequence of opcodes.
