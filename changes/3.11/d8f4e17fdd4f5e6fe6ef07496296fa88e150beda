ASoC: SPEAr spdif_{in,out}: fix fallout of previous cleanup

The patch that resulted in

	bfcc74e (ASoC: SPEAr spdif_{in,out}: use devm for clk and a few
more cleanups)

was broken and applied on a newer tree than it was created for. So
bfcc74e introduced unbalanced clk handling, two warnings about unused
variables and passed 3 arguments to a function only taking 2. This
commit fixes that.
