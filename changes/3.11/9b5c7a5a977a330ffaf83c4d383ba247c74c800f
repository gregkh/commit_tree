ACPI / PM: Fix possible NULL pointer deref in acpi_pm_device_sleep_state()

After commit fa1675b (ACPI / PM: Rework and clean up
acpi_dev_pm_get_state()) a NULL pointer dereference will take place
if NULL is passed to acpi_pm_device_sleep_state() as the second
argument.

Fix that by avoiding to use the pointer that may be NULL until
it's necessary to store a return value at the location pointed to
by it (if not NULL).
