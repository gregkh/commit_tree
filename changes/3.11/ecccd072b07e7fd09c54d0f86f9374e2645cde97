mac80211: fix mesh deadlock

The patch "cfg80211/mac80211: use cfg80211 wdev mutex in
mac80211" introduced several deadlocks by converting the
ifmsh->mtx to wdev->mtx. Solve these by:

1. drop the cancel_work_sync() in ieee80211_stop_mesh().
   Instead make the mesh work conditional on whether the mesh
   is running or not.
2. lock the mesh work with sdata_lock() to protect beacon
   updates and prevent races with wdev->mesh_id_len or
   cfg80211.
