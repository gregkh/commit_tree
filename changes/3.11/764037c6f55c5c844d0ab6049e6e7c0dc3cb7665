ARM: at91: dt: add header to define at_hdmac configuration

DMA-cell content is a concatenation of several values. In order to keep this
stuff human readable, macros are introduced.

The values for the FIFO configuration are not the same as the ones used in the
configuration register in order to keep backward compatibility. Most devices
use the half FIFO configuration but USART ones have to use the ASAP
configuration. This parameter was not initially planed to be into the at91 dma
dt binding. The third cell will be used to store this parameter, it will
become a concatenation of the FIFO configuration and of the peripheral ID. In
order to keep backward compatibility i.e. FIFO configuration is equal to 0, we
have to perform a translation since the value to put in the register to set
half FIFO is 1.
