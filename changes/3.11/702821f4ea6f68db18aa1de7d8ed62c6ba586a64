net: revert 8728c544a9c ("net: dev_pick_tx() fix")

commit 8728c544a9cbdc ("net: dev_pick_tx() fix") and commit
b6fe83e9525a ("bonding: refine IFF_XMIT_DST_RELEASE capability")
are quite incompatible : Queue selection is disabled because skb
dst was dropped before entering bonding device.

This causes major performance regression, mainly because TCP packets
for a given flow can be sent to multiple queues.

This is particularly visible when using the new FQ packet scheduler
with MQ + FQ setup on the slaves.

We can safely revert the first commit now that 416186fbf8c5b
("net: Split core bits of netdev_pick_tx into __netdev_pick_tx")
properly caps the queue_index.
