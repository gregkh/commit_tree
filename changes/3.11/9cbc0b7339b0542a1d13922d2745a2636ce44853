CIFS: Reconnect durable handles for SMB2

On reconnects, we need to reopen file and then obtain all byte-range
locks held by the client. SMB2 protocol provides feature to make
this process atomic by reconnecting to the same file handle
with all it's byte-range locks. This patch adds this capability
for SMB2 shares.
