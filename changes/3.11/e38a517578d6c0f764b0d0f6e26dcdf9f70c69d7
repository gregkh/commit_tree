ARM: lpae: fix definition of PTE_HWTABLE_PTRS

For 2-level page tables, PTE_HWTABLE_PTRS describes the offset between
Linux PTEs and hardware PTEs. On LPAE, there is no distinction (since
we have 64-bit descriptors with plenty of space) so PTE_HWTABLE_PTRS
should be 0. Unfortunately, it is wrongly defined as PTRS_PER_PTE,
meaning that current pte table flushing is off by a page. Luckily,
all current LPAE implementations are SMP, so the hardware walker can
snoop L1.

This patch fixes the broken definition.
