Input: MT - Specify that ABS_MT_SLOT must have a minimum of 0

This is effectively already in force through input_mt_init_slots, and uinput
too ignores the actual minimum.

Since slots are a kernel-genenerated axis only, non-zero minimums make
little sense and are likely to cause errors. Better to treat a non-zero
minimum as kernel bug if it ever happens.
