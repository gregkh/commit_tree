nfsd4: fix minorversion support interface

You can turn on or off support for minorversions using e.g.

	echo "-4.2" >/proc/fs/nfsd/versions

However, the current implementation is a little wonky.  For example, the
above will turn off 4.2 support, but it will also turn *on* 4.1 support.

This didn't matter as long as we only had 2 minorversions, which was
true till very recently.

And do a little cleanup here.
