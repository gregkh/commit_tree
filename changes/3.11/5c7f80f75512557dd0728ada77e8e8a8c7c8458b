Add trivial driver to disable Intel Smart Connect

Intel Smart Connect is an Intel-specific ACPI interface for configuring
devices to wake up at regular intervals so they can pull down mail or other
internet updates, and then go to sleep again. If a user enables this in
Windows and then reboots into Linux, the device may wake up if it's put to
sleep. Since there's no Linux userland support for any of this, the machine
will then remain awake until something else puts it back to sleep.

I haven't figured out all that much about how this works (there's a bunch
of different ACPI calls available on the device), but this seems to be
enough to turn it off. We can add more features to this driver if anyone
ever cares about figuring out what the rest of the calls do or writing some
Linux userspace to implement the rest of it.
