cpufreq: e_powersaver: call CPUFREQ_POSTCHANGE notfier in error cases

In case we have started PRECHANGE notifier and found an error, we
must call POSTCHANGE notifier with freqs.new = freqs.old.

This driver does take care of it, but the POSTCHANGE is called with
freqs.new on errors too, which is incorrect, so fix it.
