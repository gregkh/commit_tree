video: ssd1307fb: Make use of horizontal addressing mode

By default, the ssd1307 controller uses an addressing mode called page
addressing. This mode only increments the column cursor in memory when
writing data but will not increments the page cursor when we are at the
end of the page.

However, the controller supports another addressing mode, called
horizontal addressing, that will maintain both the page and column
cursors when writing data to the controller.

That means that we can just remove the code that increments the current
page address and reset the column cursor when reaching the end of the
line, allowing to have a lower data overhead, and a simpler driver.
