fbcon: convert last fbcon_takeover call to do_fbcon_takeover

After commit 054430e773c9a1e26f38e30156eff02dedfffc17 (fbcon: fix locking harder),
there is only one place use do_fbcon_takeover now, this patch
convert it to do_fbcon_takeover too, then we can delete
fbcon_takeover whos function can be achieved with do_fbcon_takeover
easily to reduce code size and duplication.
