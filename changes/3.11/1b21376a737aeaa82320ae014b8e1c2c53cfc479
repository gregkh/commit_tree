ARM: 7777/1: Avoid extra calls to the C compiler

Starting up the C compiler can be a slow operation on some systems.
Though these calls don't individually take a lot of time, they add up.
Rearrange the ARM Makefile a bit to avoid extra calls to the compiler
when they can be easily avoided.

When running with the Chrome OS ARM cross compiler
"armv7a-cros-linux-gnueabi-", this shaved .55 seconds (from 5.31
seconds to 4.76 seconds) off an incremental build of the kernel:
  time make -j32 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=armv7a-cros-linux-gnueabi-

Thanks to Mike Frysinger for the clean trick to make this work.
