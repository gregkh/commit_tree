blk-throttle: make tg_dispatch_one_bio() ready for hierarchy

tg_dispatch_one_bio() currently assumes that the parent_sq is the top
level one and the bio being dispatched is ready to be issued; however,
this assumption will be wrong with proper hierarchy support.  This
patch makes the following changes to make tg_dispatch_on_bio() ready
for hiearchy.

* throtl_data->nr_queued[] is incremented in blk_throtl_bio() instead
  of throtl_add_bio_tg() so that throtl_add_bio_tg() can be used to
  transfer a bio from a child tg to its parent.

* tg_dispatch_one_bio() is updated to distinguish whether its parent
  is another throtl_grp or the throtl_data.  If former, the bio is
  transferred to the parent throtl_grp using throtl_add_bio_tg().  If
  latter, the bio is ready to be issued and put on the top-level
  service_queue's bio_lists[] and throtl_data->nr_queued is
  decremented.

As all throtl_grps currently have the top level service_queue as their
->parent_sq, this patch in itself doesn't make any behavior
difference.
