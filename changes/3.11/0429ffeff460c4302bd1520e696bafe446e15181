ASoC: samsung: Remove obsolete GPIO based DT pinmuxing

Since the Samsung platforms have moved to pinctrl for pin muxing and that
is handled in the core the old GPIO based muxing code can just be removed.
Something similar had been submitted by Thomas Abraham back in March but
a resubmission following review never happened.
