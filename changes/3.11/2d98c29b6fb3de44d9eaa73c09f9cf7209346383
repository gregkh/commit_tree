net: bridge: convert MLDv2 Query MRC into msecs_to_jiffies for max_delay

While looking into MLDv1/v2 code, I noticed that bridging code does
not convert it's max delay into jiffies for MLDv2 messages as we do
in core IPv6' multicast code.

RFC3810, 5.1.3. Maximum Response Code says:

  The Maximum Response Code field specifies the maximum time allowed
  before sending a responding Report. The actual time allowed, called
  the Maximum Response Delay, is represented in units of milliseconds,
  and is derived from the Maximum Response Code as follows: [...]

As we update timers that work with jiffies, we need to convert it.
