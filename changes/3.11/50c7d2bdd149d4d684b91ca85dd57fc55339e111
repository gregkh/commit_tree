ARM: dts: AM33XX: Add pinmux configuration for CPSW to am335x EVM

Add pinmux configurations for RGMII based CPSW ethernet to am335x-evm.

Default mode is nothing but the values required for the module during
active state. With this configurations module is functional as
expected.

Sleep mode is nothing but the values required for the module during
inactive state. The pins are configured to its reset state to optimize
energy usage for the pins for the suspend/resume cycle
