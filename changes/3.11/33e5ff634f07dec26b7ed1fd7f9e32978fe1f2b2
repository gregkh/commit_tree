x86/tracing: Add config option checking to the definitions of mce handlers

In case CONFIG_X86_MCE_THRESHOLD and CONFIG_X86_THERMAL_VECTOR
are disabled, kernel build fails as follows.

   arch/x86/built-in.o: In function `trace_threshold_interrupt':
   (.entry.text+0x122b): undefined reference to `smp_trace_threshold_interrupt'
   arch/x86/built-in.o: In function `trace_thermal_interrupt':
   (.entry.text+0x132b): undefined reference to `smp_trace_thermal_interrupt'

In this case, trace_threshold_interrupt/trace_thermal_interrupt
are not needed to define.

So, add config option checking to their definitions in entry_64.S.
