vfio-pci: Avoid deadlock on remove

If an attempt is made to unbind a device from vfio-pci while that
device is in use, the request is blocked until the device becomes
unused.  Unfortunately, that unbind path still grabs the device_lock,
which certain things like __pci_reset_function() also want to take.
This means we need to try to acquire the locks ourselves and use the
pre-locked version, __pci_reset_function_locked().
