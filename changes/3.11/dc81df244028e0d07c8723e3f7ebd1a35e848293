ARC: [tlb-miss] Fix bug with CONFIG_ARC_DBG_TLB_MISS_COUNT

LOAD_FAULT_PTE macro is expected to set r2 with faulting vaddr.
However in case of CONFIG_ARC_DBG_TLB_MISS_COUNT, it was getting
clobbered with statistics collection code.

Fix latter by using a different register.

Note that only I-TLB Miss handler was potentially affected.
