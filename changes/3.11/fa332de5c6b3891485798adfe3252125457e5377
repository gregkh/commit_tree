dmaengine: ste_dma40: Supply full Device Tree parsing support

Using the new DMA DT bindings and API, we can register the DMA40 driver
as Device Tree capable. Now, when a client attempts to allocate a
channel using the DMA DT bindings via its own node, we are able to parse
the request and allocate a channel in the correct manner.
