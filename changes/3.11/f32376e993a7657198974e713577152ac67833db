staging: comedi: addi_apci_3xxx: fix the analog input subdevice

The analog input subdevice support functions in hwdrv_apci3xxx.c
do not follow the comedi API.

The (*insn_config) function overrides the INSN_CONFIG_DIO_INPUT
instruction as an internal APCI3XXX_CONFIGURATION instruction. The
APCI3XXX_CONFIGURATION instruction requires 4 data parameters but
the comedi core sanity checks the INSN_CONFIG_DIO_INPUT instruction
which only has 1 data parameter. Because of this the (*insn_config)
function can never be called.

The (*insn_read) function is supposed to do "one-shot" or "software-
triggered" reads and return the data. The function in hwdrv_apci3xxx.c
does do this but it also is used to optionally start a "hardware-
triggered" conversion. Hardware-triggered conversions should be done
with the comedi_async command functions.

Delete the hwrdv_apci3xxx.c file and fix the analog input subdevice
in the driver by:

1) add a new (*insn_read) function for "one-shot" reads
2) implement the (*do_cmdtest) and (*do_cmd) functions for
   "hardware-triggered" asyncronous reads
3) fix the interrupt handler to return the read data via the
   comedi_async buffer
