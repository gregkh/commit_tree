net: allow large number of tx queues

netif_alloc_netdev_queues() uses kcalloc() to allocate memory
for the "struct netdev_queue *_tx" array.

For large number of tx queues, kcalloc() might fail, so this
patch does a fallback to vzalloc().

As vmalloc() adds overhead on a critical network path, add __GFP_REPEAT
to kzalloc() flags to do this fallback only when really needed.
