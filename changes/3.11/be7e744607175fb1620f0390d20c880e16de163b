powerpc/eeh: Enable EEH check for config access

The patch enables EEH check and let EEH core to process the EEH
errors for PowerNV platform while accessing config space. Originally,
the implementation already had mechanism to check EEH errors and
tried to recover from them. However, we never let EEH core to handle
the EEH errors.
