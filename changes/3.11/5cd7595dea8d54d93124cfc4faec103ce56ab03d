PCI/IA64: embed pci hostbridge resources into pci_root_info

Currently, pcibios_resource_to_bus() and pcibios_bus_to_resource()
functions use pci_host_bridge to translate bus side address from/to
cpu side address. The pci_window in pci_controller never be used again.
So we remove pci_window in pci_controller and embed hostbridge resource
into pci_root_info. Bjorn suggested to implement hostbridge resources
release in IA64 like in X86, this patch is to prepare for that.
