mm: save soft-dirty bits on swapped pages

Andy Lutomirski reported that if a page with _PAGE_SOFT_DIRTY bit set
get swapped out, the bit is getting lost and no longer available when
pte read back.

To resolve this we introduce _PTE_SWP_SOFT_DIRTY bit which is saved in
pte entry for the page being swapped out.  When such page is to be read
back from a swap cache we check for bit presence and if it's there we
clear it and restore the former _PAGE_SOFT_DIRTY bit back.

One of the problem was to find a place in pte entry where we can save
the _PTE_SWP_SOFT_DIRTY bit while page is in swap.  The _PAGE_PSE was
chosen for that, it doesn't intersect with swap entry format stored in
pte.
