xen-netback: enable user to unload netback module

This patch enables user to unload netback module, which is useful when user
wants to upgrade to a newer netback module without rebooting the host.

Netfront cannot handle netback removal event. As we cannot fix all possible
frontends we add module get / put along with vif get / put to avoid
mis-unloading of netback. To unload netback module, user needs to shutdown all
VMs or migrate them to another host or unplug all vifs before hand.
