checkpatch: change CamelCase test and make it --strict

Do not bleat a message on nominally acceptable CamelCase uses that are
separated by an _ like drm_core_has_MTRR.

CamelCase tests are also a bit noisy against certain types of code
acceptable to some kernel developers.

Make the test applicable only with --strict.
