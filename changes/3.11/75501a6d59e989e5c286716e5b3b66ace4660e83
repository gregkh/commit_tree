cgroup: update iterators to use cgroup_next_sibling()

This patch converts cgroup_for_each_child(),
cgroup_next_descendant_pre/post() and thus
cgroup_for_each_descendant_pre/post() to use cgroup_next_sibling()
instead of manually dereferencing ->sibling.next.

The only reason the iterators couldn't allow dropping RCU read lock
while iteration is in progress was because they couldn't determine the
next sibling safely once RCU read lock is dropped.  Using
cgroup_next_sibling() removes that problem and enables all iterators
to allow dropping RCU read lock in the middle.  Comments are updated
accordingly.

This makes the iterators easier to use and will simplify controllers.

Note that @cgroup argument is renamed to @cgrp in
cgroup_for_each_child() because it conflicts with "struct cgroup" used
in the new macro body.
