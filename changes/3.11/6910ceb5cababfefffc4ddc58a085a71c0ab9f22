Watchdog: fix clearing of the watchdog interrupt

The bits in BRIDGE_CAUSE are documented as RW0C - read, write 0 to
clear.  If we read the register, mask off the watchdog bit, and
write it back, we're actually clearing every interrupt which wasn't
pending at the time we read the register - and that is racy.

Fix this to only write ~WATCHDOG_BIT to the register, which means
we write as zero only the watchdog bit.
