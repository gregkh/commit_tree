printk: Fix rq->lock vs logbuf_lock unlock lock inversion

commit 07354eb1a74d1 ("locking printk: Annotate logbuf_lock as raw")
reintroduced a lock inversion problem which was fixed in commit
0b5e1c5255 ("printk: Release console_sem after logbuf_lock"). This
happened probably when fixing up patch rejects.

Restore the ordering and unlock logbuf_lock before releasing
console_sem.
