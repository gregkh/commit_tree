net: sctp: confirm route during forward progress

This fix has been proposed originally by Vlad Yasevich. He says:

  When SCTP makes forward progress (receives a SACK that acks new chunks,
  renegs, or answeres 0-window probes) or when HB-ACK arrives, mark
  the route as confirmed so we don't unnecessarily send NUD probes.

Having a simple SCTP client/server that exchange data chunks every 1sec,
without this patch ARP requests are sent periodically every 40-60sec.
With this fix applied, an ARP request is only done once right at the
"session" beginning. Also, when clearing the related ARP cache entry
manually during the session, a new request is correctly done. I have
only "backported" this to net-next and tested that it works, so full
credit goes to Vlad.
