sunrpc: Don't schedule an upcall on a replaced cache entry.

When a cache entry is replaced, the "expiry_time" get set to
zero by a call to "cache_fresh_locked(..., 0)" at the end of
"sunrpc_cache_update".

This low expiry time makes cache_check() think that the 'refresh_age'
is negative, so the 'age' is comparatively large and a refresh is
triggered.
However refreshing a replaced entry it pointless, it cannot achieve
anything useful.

So teach cache_check to ignore a low refresh_age when expiry_time
is zero.
