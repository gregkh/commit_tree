ARM: ARMv7-M: Add support for exception handling

This patch implements the exception handling for the ARMv7-M
architecture (pretty different from the A or R profiles).

It bases on work done earlier by Catalin for 2.6.33 but was nearly
completely rewritten to use a pt_regs layout compatible to the A
profile.
