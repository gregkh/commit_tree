Revert "drm: kms_helper: don't lose hotplug event"

This reverts commit 160954b7bca43da7cd3cfbce310e6df919a8216e.

This was rearming the workqueue with a 0 timeout, causing
a WARN_ON, and possible loop.

"I've looked a bit into this and I think we need to have a separate
work struct for recovering these lost hotplug events since the
continuous self-rearming case is a real risk (e.g. if a connector
flip-flops all the time). At least I don't see a sane way to block out
re-arming with the current code in a simple way. So reverting the
offender seems like the right thing and I'll go back to the drawing
board for 3.12."
