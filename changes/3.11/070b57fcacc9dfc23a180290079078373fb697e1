cpuset: introduce effective_{cpumask|nodemask}_cpuset()

effective_cpumask_cpuset() returns an ancestor cpuset which has
non-empty cpumask.

If a cpuset is empty and the tasks in it need to update their
cpus_allowed, they take on the ancestor cpuset's cpumask.

This currently won't change any behavior, but it will later allow us
to keep tasks in empty cpusets.
