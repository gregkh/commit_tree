xfrm: make local error reporting more robust

In xfrm4 and xfrm6 we need to take care about sockets of the other
address family. This could happen because a 6in4 or 4in6 tunnel could
get protected by ipsec.

Because we don't want to have a run-time dependency on ipv6 when only
using ipv4 xfrm we have to embed a pointer to the correct local_error
function in xfrm_state_afinet and look it up when returning an error
depending on the socket address family.

Thanks to vi0ss for the great bug report:
<https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58691>

v2:
a) fix two more unsafe interpretations of skb->sk as ipv6 socket
   (xfrm6_local_dontfrag and __xfrm6_output)
v3:
a) add an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(xfrm_local_error) to fix a link error when
   building ipv6 as a module (thanks to Steffen Klassert)
