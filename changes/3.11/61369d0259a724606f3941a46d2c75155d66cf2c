net: stmmac: fixed enh_desc set always zero

This patch fixed that enh_desc value is always zero.
Due to calling order of stmmac_selec_desc_mode(), enh_desc value is always zero.
Even though mac is set to use enhanced dma descriptor, if enh_desc is zero,
functions related dma descriptor are not working correctly.
