OMAPDSS: add module_get/put to omap_dss_get/put_device()

omap_dss_get_device() should be called for omap_dss_device before it is
used to increase its refcount. Currently we only increase the refcount
for the underlying device.

This patch adds managing the ref count to the underlying module also,
which contains the ops for the omap_dss_device.
