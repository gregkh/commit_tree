drbd: Allow online change of al-stripes and al-stripe-size

Allow to change the AL layout with an resize operation. For that
the reisze command gets two new fields: al_stripes and al_stripe_size.

In order to make the operation crash save:
1) Lock out all IO and MD-IO
2) Write the super block with MDF_PRIMARY_IND clear
3) write the bitmap to the new location (all zeros, since
   we allow only while connected)
4) Initialize the new AL-area
5) Write the super block with the restored MDF_PRIMARY_IND.
6) Unfreeze all IO

Since the AL-layout has no influence on the protocol, this operation
needs to be beforemed on both sides of a resource (if intended).
