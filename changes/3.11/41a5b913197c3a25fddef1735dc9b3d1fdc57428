jbd2: invalidate handle if jbd2_journal_restart() fails

If jbd2_journal_restart() fails the handle will have been disconnected
from the current transaction.  In this situation, the handle must not
be used for for any jbd2 function other than jbd2_journal_stop().
Enforce this with by treating a handle which has a NULL transaction
pointer as an aborted handle, and issue a kernel warning if
jbd2_journal_extent(), jbd2_journal_get_write_access(),
jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata(), etc. is called with an invalid handle.

This commit also fixes a bug where jbd2_journal_stop() would trip over
a kernel jbd2 assertion check when trying to free an invalid handle.

Also move the responsibility of setting current->journal_info to
start_this_handle(), simplifying the three users of this function.
