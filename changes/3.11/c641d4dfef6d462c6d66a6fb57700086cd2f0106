ARM: nomadik: add the new clocks to the device tree

This revamps the device tree to fit with the new clock
implementation and brings it quite a bit closer to how
the hardware actually works.

After this the clock implementation knows about all
clock gates and will gate off all unused clocks at
boot time and save a bit of power.
