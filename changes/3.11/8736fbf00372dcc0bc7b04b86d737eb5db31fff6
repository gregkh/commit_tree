f2fs: optimize the init_dirty_segmap function

Optimize the while loop condition

Since this condition will always be true and while loop will
be terminated by the following condition in code:

if (segno >= TOTAL_SEGS(sbi))
    break;
Hence we can replace the while loop condition with while(1)
instead of always checking for segno to be less than Total segs.

Also we do not need to use TOTAL_SEGS() everytime. We can store
this value in a local variable since this value is constant.
