drm/i915: move fdi lane configuration checks ahead

This nicely allows us to drop some hacks which have only been used
to work around modeset failures due to lack of fdi lanes.

v2: Implement proper checking for Haswell platforms - the fdi link to
the LPT PCH has only 2 lanes. Note that we already filter out
impossible modes in intel_crt_mode_valid. Unfortunately LPT does not
support 6bpc on the fdi rx, so we can't pull clever tricks to squeeze
in a few more modes.

v2: Rebased on top of Ben Widawsky's num_pipes reorg.

v3: Rebase on top of Ville's pipe debug output ocd rampage.

v4: Fixup rebase fail spotted by Ville.

v5: Fixup rebase fail spotted by Imre Deak. I suck.
