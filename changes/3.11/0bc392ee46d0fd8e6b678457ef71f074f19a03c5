tracing: Change tracing_entries_fops to rely on tracing_get_cpu()

tracing_open_generic_tc() is racy, the memory inode->i_private
points to can be already freed.

1. Change its last user, tracing_entries_fops, to use
   tracing_*_generic_tr() instead.

2. Change debugfs_create_file("buffer_size_kb", data) callers
   to pass "data = tr".

3. Change tracing_entries_read() and tracing_entries_write() to
   use tracing_get_cpu().

4. Kill the no longer used tracing_open_generic_tc() and
   tracing_release_generic_tc().
