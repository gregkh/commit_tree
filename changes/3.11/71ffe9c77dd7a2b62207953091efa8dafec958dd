netfilter: xt_TCPMSS: fix handling of malformed TCP header and options

Make sure the packet has enough room for the TCP header and
that it is not malformed.

While at it, store tcph->doff*4 in a variable, as it is used
several times.

This patch also fixes a possible off by one in case of malformed
TCP options.
