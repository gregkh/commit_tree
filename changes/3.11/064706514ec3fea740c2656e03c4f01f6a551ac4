clocksource: Add generic dummy timer driver

Several architectures have a dummy timer driver tightly coupled with
their broadcast code to support machines without cpu-local timers (or
where there is a lack of driver support).

Since 12ad100046: "clockevents: Add generic timer broadcast function"
it's been possible to write broadcast-capable timer drivers decoupled
from the broadcast mechanism. We can use this functionality to implement
a generic dummy timer driver that can be shared by all architectures
with generic tick broadcast (ARCH_HAS_TICK_BROADCAST).

This patch implements a generic dummy timer using this facility.

[sboyd: Make percpu data static, use __this_cpu_ptr(), move to
        early_initcall to properly register on each CPU, only
	register if more than one CPU possible]
