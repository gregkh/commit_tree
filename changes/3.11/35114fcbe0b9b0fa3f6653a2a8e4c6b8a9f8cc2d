Revert "ptrace: PTRACE_DETACH should do flush_ptrace_hw_breakpoint(child)"

This reverts commit fab840fc2d542fabcab903db8e03589a6702ba5f.

This commit even has the test-case to prove that the tracee
can be killed by SIGTRAP if the debugger does not remove the
breakpoints before PTRACE_DETACH.

However, this is exactly what wineserver deliberately does,
set_thread_context() calls PTRACE_ATTACH + PTRACE_DETACH just
for PTRACE_POKEUSER(DR*) in between.

So we should revert this fix and document that PTRACE_DETACH
should keep the breakpoints.
