watchdog: Rename confusing state variable

We have two very conflicting state variable names in the
watchdog:

* watchdog_enabled: This one reflects the user interface. It's
set to 1 by default and can be overriden with boot options
or sysctl/procfs interface.

* watchdog_disabled: This is the internal toggle state that
tells if watchdog threads, timers and NMI events are currently
running or not. This state mostly depends on the user settings.
It's a convenient state latch.

Now we really need to find clearer names because those
are just too confusing to encourage deep review.

watchdog_enabled now becomes watchdog_user_enabled to reflect
its purpose as an interface.

watchdog_disabled becomes watchdog_running to suggest its
role as a pure internal state.
