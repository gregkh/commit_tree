mmc: core: production year for eMMC 4.41 and later

The field containing the production date in the CID register only uses
4 bits to encode the year, starting from 1997 in the original standard.
In 2013, the production year field contains 0, and the kernel reports a
1997 production date.

The eMMC 4.51 specification adds a new interpretation rule. For all
devices implementing the 4.41 specification or later, the production
year field will be interpreted as a value between 2010 and 2025, with
0 corresponding to 2013.
