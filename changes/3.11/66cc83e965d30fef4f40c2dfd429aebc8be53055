staging/lustre/obdclass: use common way to store lastid

Local files last id are stored in root in files named seq-xxx-lastid
while lastid for OST objects is stored in O/seq/LAST_ID special
object with zero OID and handled by OSD.
Patch reworks local files lastid to be stored in O/seq/LAST_ID too
and using the same format.
