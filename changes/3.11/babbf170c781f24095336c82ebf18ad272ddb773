Btrfs: make the snap/subv deletion end more early when the fs is R/O

The snapshot/subvolume deletion might spend lots of time, it would make
the remount task wait for a long time. This patch improve this problem,
we will break the deletion if the fs is remounted to be R/O. It will make
the users happy.
