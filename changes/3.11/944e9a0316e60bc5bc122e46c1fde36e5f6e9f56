cpufreq: governors: Move get_governor_parent_kobj() to cpufreq.c

get_governor_parent_kobj() can be used by any governor, generic
cpufreq governors or platform specific ones and so must be present in
cpufreq.c instead of cpufreq_governor.c.

This patch moves it to cpufreq.c. This also adds
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(get_governor_parent_kobj) so that modules can use
this function too.
