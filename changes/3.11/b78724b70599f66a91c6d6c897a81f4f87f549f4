nfsd4: fail attempts to request gss on the backchannel

We don't support gss on the backchannel.  We should state that fact up
front rather than just letting things continue and later making the
client try to figure out why the backchannel isn't working.

Trond suggested instead returning NFS4ERR_NOENT.  I think it would be
tricky for the client to distinguish between the case "I don't support
gss on the backchannel" and "I can't find that in my cache, please
create another context and try that instead", and I'd prefer something
that currently doesn't have any other meaning for this operation, hence
the (somewhat arbitrary) NFS4ERR_ENCR_ALG_UNSUPP.
