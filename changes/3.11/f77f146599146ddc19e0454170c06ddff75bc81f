cpufreq: pcc: call CPUFREQ_POSTCHANGE notfier in error cases

PRECHANGE and POSTCHANGE notifiers must be called in groups, i.e
either both should be called or both shouldn't be.

In case we have started PRECHANGE notifier and found an error, we
must call POSTCHANGE notifier with freqs.new = freqs.old to guarantee
that the sequence of calling notifiers is complete.

This patch fixes it.
