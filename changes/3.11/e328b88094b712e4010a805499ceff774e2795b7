ARM: clps711x: Re-add GPIO support

arch_initcall was been removed from GPIO driver, so this patch
re-add support for GPIO into boards as platform_device.
Since some drivers (spi, nand, etc.) is not support deferred probe,
separate machine init calls is used in board code to make proper
loading sequence.
