ARM: AM33XX: clock data: Enable clkout2 as part of init

clkout2 comes out on the pad and is being used by various
external on-board peripherals like, Audio codecs and stuff.
So enable the clkout2 by default during init sequence itself.

Also, add the missing entry of "clkout2_ck" to the clock table.
