ARM: imx: move clk_prepare() out from mxc_restart()

It's inappropriate to call clk_prepare() in mxc_restart(), because the
restart routine could be called in atomic context.  Move clk_get() and
clk_prepare() into mxc_arch_reset_init() and only have the atomic part
clk_enable() be called in mxc_restart().

As a result, mxc_arch_reset_init() needs to be called after clk gets
initialized.

While there, it also changes printk(KERN_ERR ...) to pr_err() and adds
__init annotation for mxc_arch_reset_init().
