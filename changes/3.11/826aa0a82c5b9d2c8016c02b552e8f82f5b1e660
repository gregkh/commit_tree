Btrfs: cleanup the code of copy_nocow_pages_for_inode()

- It make no sense that we continue to do something after the error
  happened, just go back with this patch.
- remove some check of copy_nocow_pages_for_inode(), such as page check
  after write, inode check in the end of the function, because we are
  sure they exist.
- remove the unnecessary goto in the return value check of the write
