sched: Use cached value of span instead of calling sched_domain_span()

In the beginning of build_sched_groups() we called sched_domain_span() and
cached its return value in span. Few statements later we are calling it again to
get the same pointer.

Lets use the cached value instead as it hasn't changed in between.
