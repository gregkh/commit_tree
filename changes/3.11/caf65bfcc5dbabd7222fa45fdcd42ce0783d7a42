batman-adv: send each broadcast only once on non-wireless interfaces

While it makes sense to send each broadcast thrice on 802.11 (WLAN) interfaces
as broadcasts are often unreliable on these, there is no reason to do so on
other interface types.

The increased the overhead can be harmful on low-bandwidth links like VPN
connections over slow internet lines, therefore it is better to reduce the
number of broadcast packets sent on non-wireless links to one.
