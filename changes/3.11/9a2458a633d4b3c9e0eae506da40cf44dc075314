mm: mremap: validate input before taking lock

This patch is very similar to commit 84d96d897671 ("mm: madvise:
complete input validation before taking lock"): perform some basic
validation of the input to mremap() before taking the
&current->mm->mmap_sem lock.

This also makes the MREMAP_FIXED => MREMAP_MAYMOVE dependency slightly
more explicit.
