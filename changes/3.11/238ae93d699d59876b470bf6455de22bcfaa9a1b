tracing: Fix file mode of free_buffer

Commit 4f271a2a60c748599b30bb4dafff30d770439b96
(tracing: Add a proc file to stop tracing and free buffer)
implement a method to free up ring buffer in kernel memory
in the release code path of free_buffer's fd.

Then we don't need read/write support for free_buffer,
indeed we just have a dummy write fop, and don't implement read fop.

So the 0200 is more reasonable file mode for free_buffer than
the current file mode 0644.
