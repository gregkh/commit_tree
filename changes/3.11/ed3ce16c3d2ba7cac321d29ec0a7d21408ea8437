Revert "MIPS: make CAC_ADDR and UNCAC_ADDR account for PHYS_OFFSET"

This reverts commit 3f4579252aa166641861a64f1c2883365ca126c2. It is
invalid because the macros CAC_ADDR and UNCAC_ADDR have a kernel
virtual address as an argument and also returns a kernel virtual
address. Using and physical address PHYS_OFFSET is blatantly wrong
for a macro common to multiple platforms.
