rt2x00: fix stop queue

Since we clear QUEUE_STARTED in rt2x00queue_stop_queue(), following
call to rt2x00queue_pause_queue() reduce to noop, i.e we do not
stop queue in mac80211.

To fix that introduce rt2x00queue_pause_queue_nocheck() function,
which will stop queue in mac80211 directly.

Note that rt2x00_start_queue() explicitly set QUEUE_PAUSED bit.

Note also that reordering operations i.e. first call to
rt2x00queue_pause_queue() and then clear QUEUE_STARTED bit, will race
with rt2x00queue_unpause_queue(), so calling ieee80211_stop_queue()
directly is the only available solution to fix the problem without
major rework.
