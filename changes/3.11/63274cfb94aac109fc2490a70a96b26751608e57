rcu: Eliminate check_for_new_grace_period() wrapper function

One of the calls to check_for_new_grace_period() is now redundant due to
an immediately preceding call to note_gp_changes().  Eliminating this
redundant call leaves a single caller, which is simpler if inlined.
This commit therefore eliminates the redundant call and inlines the
body of check_for_new_grace_period() into the single remaining call site.
