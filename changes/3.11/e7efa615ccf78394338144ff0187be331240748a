slab: add kmalloc() to kernel API documentation

At the moment, kmalloc() isn't even listed in the kernel API
documentation (DocBook/kernel-api.html after running "make htmldocs").

Another issue is that the documentation for kmalloc_node()
refers to kcalloc()'s documentation to describe its 'flags' parameter,
while kcalloc() refered to kmalloc()'s documentation, which doesn't exist!

This patch is a proposed fix for this. It also removes the documentation
for kmalloc() in include/linux/slob_def.h which isn't included to
generate the documentation anyway. This way, kmalloc() is described
in only one place.
