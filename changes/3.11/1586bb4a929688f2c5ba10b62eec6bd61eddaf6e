regulator: Remove unnecessary include of linux/delay.h from regulator drivers

All the drivers that need delay for the regulator voltage output voltage to
stabilize after being enabled or after being set to a new value has been
converted to implement enable_time and set_voltage_time_sel callbacks.
Then regulator core will take care of the necessary delay.

This patch removes the unneeded include of linux/delay.h in regulator drivers.
