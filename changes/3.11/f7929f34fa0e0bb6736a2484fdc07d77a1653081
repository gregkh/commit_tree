drm/radeon: Another card with wrong primary dac adj

Hello,
got another card with "too bright" problem:
Sapphire Radeon VE 7000 DDR (VGA+S-Video)

lspci -vnn:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RV100 QY [Radeon 7000/VE] [1002:5159] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
        Subsystem: PC Partner Limited Sapphire Radeon VE 7000 DDR [174b:7c28]

The patch below fixes the problem for this card.
But I don't like the blacklist, couldn't some heuristic be used instead?
The interesting thing is that the manufacturer is the same as the other card
needing the same quirk. I wonder how many different types are broken this way.

The "wrong" ps2_pdac_adj value that comes from BIOS on this card is 0x300.

====================
drm/radeon: Add primary dac adj quirk for Sapphire Radeon VE 7000 DDR

Values from BIOS are wrong, causing too bright colors.
Use default values instead.
