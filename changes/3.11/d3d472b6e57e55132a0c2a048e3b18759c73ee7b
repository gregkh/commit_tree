Staging: winbond: Check for unsuccessful allocation immediately

Check to see if allocation by kzalloc() or usb_alloc_urb() was unsuccessful
immediately after the allocation. Exit from the function can be right at that
point in case of allocation failure.
This avoids unnecessary use of usb_alloc_urb() & usb_free_urb() if kzalloc()
returns NULL.
Also, makes the code better structured & easier to understand.
