[media] ARM: davinci: dm365 evm: remove init_enable from ths7303 pdata

Remove init_enable from ths7303 pdata as it is being dropped
from ths7303_platform_data.
The purpose of init_enable was that the device should start streaming video
immediately but instead the bridge drivers should call s_stream explicitly
for such devices. This is in fact what happens for the dm365, so setting
init_enable here never made sense in the first place.
