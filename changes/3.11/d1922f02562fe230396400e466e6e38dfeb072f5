cpufreq: Simplify userspace governor

Userspace governor has got more code than what it needs for its
functioning, so simplify it.

Portions of code removed are:
 - Extra header files which aren't required anymore (rearrange them
   as well).
 - cpu_{max|min|cur|set}_freq, as they are always the same as
   policy->{max|min|cur}.
 - userspace_cpufreq_notifier_block as we don't need to set
   cpu_cur_freq anymore.
 - cpus_using_userspace_governor as it was for the notifier code.
