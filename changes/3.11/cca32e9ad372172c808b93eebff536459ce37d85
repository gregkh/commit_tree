drm/i915: properly set HSW WM_LP watermarks

We were previously only setting the WM_PIPE registers, now we are
setting the LP watermark registers. This should allow deeper PC
states, resulting in power savings.

We're only using 1/2 data buffer partitioning for now.

v2: Merge both hsw_compute_pri_wm_* functions (Ville)
v3: - Simplify hsw_compute_wm_results (Ville)
    - Rebase due to changes on the previous patch
v4: Unconfuse wm_lp/level (Ville)
