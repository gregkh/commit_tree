ext4: don't allow ext4_free_blocks() to fail due to ENOMEM

The filesystem should not be marked inconsistent if ext4_free_blocks()
is not able to allocate memory.  Unfortunately some callers (most
notably ext4_truncate) don't have a way to reflect an error back up to
the VFS.  And even if we did, most userspace applications won't deal
with most system calls returning ENOMEM anyway.
