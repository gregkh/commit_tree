jbd2: move superblock checksum calculation to jbd2_write_superblock()

Some of the functions which modify the jbd2 superblock were not
updating the checksum before calling jbd2_write_superblock().  Move
the call to jbd2_superblock_csum_set() to jbd2_write_superblock(), so
that the checksum is calculated consistently.
