[media] rtl2832u: restore ir remote control support

Hi,
This patch uses the driver from openpli[1] as a template to restore the remote control support.
I had to divert from the original to use the in kernel rc protocol decoder. The key repetition does,
not seem to work but I cant find the problem in the driver. As a raw rc provider, no key table is
hardcoded.
Rodrigo.
