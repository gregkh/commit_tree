net/sunrpc: xpt_auth_cache should be ignored when expired.

commit d202cce8963d9268ff355a386e20243e8332b308
    sunrpc: never return expired entries in sunrpc_cache_lookup

moved the 'entry is expired' test from cache_check to
sunrpc_cache_lookup, so that it happened early and some races could
safely be ignored.

However the ip_map (in svcauth_unix.c) has a separate single-item
cache which allows quick lookup without locking.  An entry in this
case would not be subject to the expiry test and so could be used
well after it has expired.

This is not normally a big problem because the first time it is used
after it is expired an up-call will be scheduled to refresh the entry
(if it hasn't been scheduled already) and the old entry will then
be invalidated.  So on the second attempt to use it after it has
expired, ip_map_cached_get will discard it.

However that is subtle and not ideal, so replace the "!cache_valid"
test with "cache_is_expired".
In doing this we drop the test on the "CACHE_VALID" bit.  This is
unnecessary as the bit is never cleared, and an entry will only
be cached if the bit is set.
