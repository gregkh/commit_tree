rt2x00: rt2800lib: fix default TX power check for RT55xx

The code writes the default_power2 value into the TX field
of the RFCSR50 register, however the condition in the if
statement uses default_power1. Due to this, wrong TX power
value might be written into the register.

Use the correct value in the condition to fix the issue.

Compile tested only.
