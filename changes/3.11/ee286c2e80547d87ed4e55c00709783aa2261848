HID: wiimote: fix classic controller parsing

I finally got a "Classic Controller" and "Classic Controller Pro" in my
hands and noticed that all analog data was incorrectly parsed. Fix this
up so we report the data that we pretend we do.

I really doubt that this breaks any backwards compatibility, but if we
get any reports, we only need to revert this single patch.
