xfs: implement inode change count

For CRC enabled filesystems, add support for the monotonic inode
version change counter that is needed by protocols like NFSv4 for
determining if the inode has changed in any way at all between two
unrelated operations on the inode.

This bumps the change count the first time an inode is dirtied in a
transaction. Since all modifications to the inode are logged, this
will catch all changes that are made to the inode, including
timestamp updates that occur during data writes.
