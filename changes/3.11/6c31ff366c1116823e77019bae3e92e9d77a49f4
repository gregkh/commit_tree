team: remove synchronize_rcu() called during queue override change

This patch removes synchronize_rcu() from function
__team_queue_override_port_del(). That can be done because it is ok to
do list_del_rcu() and list_add_tail_rcu() on the same list_head member
without calling synchronize_rcu() in between. A bit of refactoring
needed to be done because INIT_LIST_HEAD needed to be removed (to not
kill the forward pointer) as well.
