[media] usbtv: Fix deinterlacing

The image data is laid out a bit more weirdly and thus needs more work to
properly interlace. What we get from hardware is V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE, but
since userspace support for it is practically nonexistent, thus we make
V4L2_FIELD_INTERLACED from it so that it's more easily interpreted.
