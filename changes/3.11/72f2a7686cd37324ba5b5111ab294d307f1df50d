[media] exynos4-is: Change fimc-is firmware file names

This patch changes the firmware file names of the FIMC-IS subsystem.
It is needed since there are different firmwares used across various
SoC series, e.g. Exynos4 and Exynos5.
Also the sensor specific "setfile" name is changed, to account for
it depends on an image sensor and is also specific to the FIMC-IS
and the SoC.
This is a change for a driver merged in 3.10.
