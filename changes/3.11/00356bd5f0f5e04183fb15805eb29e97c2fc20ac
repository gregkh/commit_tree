cgroup: clean up cgroup_serial_nr_cursor

cgroup_serial_nr_cursor was created atomic64_t because I thought it
was never gonna used for anything other than assigning unique numbers
to cgroups and didn't want to worry about synchronization; however,
now we're using it as an event-stamp to distinguish cgroups created
before and after certain point which assumes that it's protected by
cgroup_mutex.

Let's make it clear by making it a u64.  Also, rename it to
cgroup_serial_nr_next and make it point to the next nr to allocate so
that where it's pointing to is clear and more conventional.
