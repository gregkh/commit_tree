aoe: perform I/O completions in parallel

Some users have a large AoE target while others like to use many AoE
targets at the same time.  In the latter case, there is an opportunity to
greatly improve aggregate throughput by allowing different threads to
complete the I/O associated with each target.  For 36 targets, 4 KiB read
throughput roughly doubles, for example, with these changes in place.
