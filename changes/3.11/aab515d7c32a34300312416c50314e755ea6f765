fib_trie: remove potential out of bound access

AddressSanitizer [1] dynamic checker pointed a potential
out of bound access in leaf_walk_rcu()

We could allocate one more slot in tnode_new() to leave the prefetch()
in-place but it looks not worth the pain.

Bug added in commit 82cfbb008572b ("[IPV4] fib_trie: iterator recode")
