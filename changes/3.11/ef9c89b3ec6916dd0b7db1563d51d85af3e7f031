dmaengine: ste_dma40: Only use addresses passed as configuration information

Addresses are passed in from the client's driver via the invocation of
dmaengine_slave_config(), so there's no need to fetch them from platform
data too, hardwired or otherwise. This is a great step forward, as it
elevates a large burden from platform data in the way of a look-up
table.
