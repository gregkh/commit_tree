KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Fix proto-VSID calculations

This makes sure the calculation of the proto-VSIDs used by PR KVM
is done with 64-bit arithmetic.  Since vcpu3s->context_id[] is int,
when we do vcpu3s->context_id[0] << ESID_BITS the shift will be done
with 32-bit instructions, possibly leading to significant bits
getting lost, as the context id can be up to 524283 and ESID_BITS is
18.  To fix this we cast the context id to u64 before shifting.
