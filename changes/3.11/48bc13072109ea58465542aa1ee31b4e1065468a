iwlwifi: mvm: refuse connection to APs with BI < 16

Due to a firmware bug, it crashes when the beacon interval
is smaller than 16. Avoid this by refusing the station state
change creating the AP station, causing mac80211 to abandon
the attempt to connect to the AP, and eventually wpa_s to
blacklist it.
