cgroup: fix umount vs cgroup_cfts_commit() race

cgroup_cfts_commit() uses dget() to keep cgroup alive after cgroup_mutex
is dropped, but dget() won't prevent cgroupfs from being umounted. When
the race happens, vfs will see some dentries with non-zero refcnt while
umount is in process.

Keep running this:
  mount -t cgroup -o blkio xxx /cgroup
  umount /cgroup

And this:
  modprobe cfq-iosched
  rmmod cfs-iosched

After a while, the BUG() in shrink_dcache_for_umount_subtree() may
be triggered:

  BUG: Dentry xxx{i=0,n=blkio.yyy} still in use (1) [umount of cgroup cgroup]
