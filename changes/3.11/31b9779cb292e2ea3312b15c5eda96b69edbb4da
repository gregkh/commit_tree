HID: ignore Jabra speakerphones HID interface

Add a quirk to ignore Jabra speakerphone 410 and 510 devices HID
interface.
On those devices, the USB audio interface is working nicely,
but the HID interface is not working with the kernel usbhid driver,
and it requires a specific userspace program.
We could unbind it from userspace but just attaching the usbhid driver has
sometimes nasty effects:
either confusing the device state machine or triggering a storm of volume key
events making eventual sound UI blinking like crazy.
