ARM: OMAP2+: Sync hwmod state with the pm_runtime and omap_device state

Some hwmods which are marked with HWMOD_INIT_NO_IDLE are left in enabled
state post setup(). When a omap_device gets created for such hwmods
make sure the omap_device and pm_runtime states are also in sync for such
hwmods by doing a omap_device_enable() and pm_runtime_set_active() for the
device.
