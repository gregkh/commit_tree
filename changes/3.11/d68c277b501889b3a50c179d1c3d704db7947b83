usb: gadget: f_mass_storage: add missing memory barrier for thread_wakeup_needed

Without this memory barrier, the file-storage thread may fail to
escape from the following while loop, because it may observe new
common->thread_wakeup_needed and old bh->state which are updated by
the callback functions.

	/* Wait for the CBW to arrive */
	while (bh->state != BUF_STATE_FULL) {
		rc = sleep_thread(common);
		if (rc)
			return rc;
	}
