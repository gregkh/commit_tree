8139cp: Add dma_mapping_error checking

Self explanitory dma_mapping_error addition to the 8139 driver, based on this:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=947250

It showed several backtraces arising for dma_map_* usage without checking the
return code on the mapping.  Add the check and abort the rx/tx operation if its
failed.  Untested as I have no hardware and the reporter has wandered off, but
seems pretty straightforward.
