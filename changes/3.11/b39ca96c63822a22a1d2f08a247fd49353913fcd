ARM: ux500: update defconfig base

Update the defconfig removing/adding selections due to
Kconfig changes, and select some new hardware drivers that
have been matured in the tree. For example:

- CONFIG_NO_HZ and CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS come from the
  make oldconfig changes after the recent changes to
  how NOHZ is handled.
- The U5500 config option is now gone as the machine is
  deleted. So is the AB5500 driver.
- CPU_IDLE selected explicitly.
- LP5521 Kconfig has been moved around.
- AB8500 core is default-selected, as is the AB8500 USB
  transciever.
- The battery and charging management drivers for the
  AB8500 are not selected again.
- Select the crypto devices that have been shaped up
  to work properly.
