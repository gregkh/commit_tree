s390/sclp: add parameter to specify number of buffer pages

Add a kernel parameter to be able to specify the number of pages to be
used as output buffer by the line-mode sclp driver and the vt220 sclp
driver. The current number of output pages is 6, if the service element
is unavailable the boot messages alone can fill up the output buffer.
If this happens the system blocks until the service element is working
again. For a large LPAR with many devices it is sensible to have the
ability to increase the output buffer size. To help to debug this
situation add a counter for the page-pool-empty situation and make it
available as a sclp driver attribute.
To avoid the system to stall until the service element works again
add another kernel parameter to allow to drop output buffers.
