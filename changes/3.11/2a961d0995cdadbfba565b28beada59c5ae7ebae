iio: mxs-lradc: Remove useless check in read_raw

The removed check in the read_raw implementation was always true,
therefore remove it. This also fixes a bug, by closely inspecting
the code, one can notice the iio_validate_scan_mask_onehot() will
always return 1 and therefore the subsequent condition will always
succeed, therefore making the mxs_lradc_read_raw() function always
return -EINVAL; .
