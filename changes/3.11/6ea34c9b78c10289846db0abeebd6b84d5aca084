kvm: exclude ioeventfd from counting kvm_io_range limit

We can easily reach the 1000 limit by start VM with a couple
hundred I/O devices (multifunction=on). The hardcode limit
already been adjusted 3 times (6 ~ 200 ~ 300 ~ 1000).

In userspace, we already have maximum file descriptor to
limit ioeventfd count. But kvm_io_bus devices also are used
for pit, pic, ioapic, coalesced_mmio. They couldn't be limited
by maximum file descriptor.

Currently only ioeventfds take too much kvm_io_bus devices,
so just exclude it from counting kvm_io_range limit.

Also fixed one indent issue in kvm_host.h
