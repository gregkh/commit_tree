ext3,ext4: don't mess with dir_file->f_pos in htree_dirblock_to_tree()

Both ext3 and ext4 htree_dirblock_to_tree() is just filling the
in-core rbtree for use by call_filldir().  All updates of ->f_pos are
done by the latter; bumping it here (on error) is obviously wrong - we
might very well have it nowhere near the block we'd found an error in.
