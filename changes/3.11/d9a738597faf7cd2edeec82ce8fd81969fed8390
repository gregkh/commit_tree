fs/9p: xattr: add trusted and security namespaces

Allow requests for security.* and trusted.* xattr name spaces
to pass through to server.

The new files are 99% cut and paste from fs/9p/xattr_user.c with the
namespaces changed.  It has the intended effect in superficial testing.
I do not know much detail about how these namespaces are used, but passing
them through to the server, which can decide whether to handle them or not,
seems reasonable.

I want to support a use case where an ext4 file system is mounted via 9P,
then re-exported via samba to windows clients in a cluster.  Windows wants
to store xattrs such as security.NTACL.  This works when ext4 directly
backs samba, but not when 9P is inserted.  This use case is documented here:
