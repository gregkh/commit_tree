rt2x00: rt2800usb: implement queue_init callback

The generic rt2x00 code has been changed to allow the
drivers toimplement dynamic data_queue initialization.

Remove the static data queue descriptor structures
and implement the queue_init callback instead.

The actual chipset is already known when the callback
is used. This allows us to use a single callback for
all supported devices.
