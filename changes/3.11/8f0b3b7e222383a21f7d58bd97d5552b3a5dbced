ALSA: hda - Fix EAPD vmaster hook for AD1884 & co

ad1884_fixup_hp_eapd() tries to set the NID for controlling the
speaker EAPD from the pin configuration.  But the current code can't
work expectedly since it sets spec->eapd_nid before calling the
generic parser where the autocfg pins are set up.

This patch changes the function to set spec->eapd_nid after the
generic parser call while it sets vmaster hook unconditionally.  The
spec->eapd_nid check is moved in the hook function itself instead.
