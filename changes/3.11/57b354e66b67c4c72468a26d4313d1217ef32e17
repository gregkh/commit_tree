dev: remove duplicate 'skb->dev = dev' in dev_forward_skb()

This was added by commit 59b9997baba5 (Revert "net: maintain namespace
isolation between vlan and real device").
In fact, before the initial commit - the one that is reverted -, this
statement was not present.
'skb->dev = dev' is already done in eth_type_trans(), which is call just
after.
