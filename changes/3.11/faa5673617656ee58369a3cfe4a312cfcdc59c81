bcache: Journal replay fix

The journal replay code starts by finding something that looks like a
valid journal entry, then it does a binary search over the unchecked
region of the journal for the journal entries with the highest sequence
numbers.

Trouble is, the logic was wrong - journal_read_bucket() returns true if
it found journal entries we need, but if the range of journal entries
we're looking for loops around the end of the journal - in that case
journal_read_bucket() could return true when it hadn't found the highest
sequence number we'd seen yet, and in that case the binary search did
the wrong thing. Whoops.
