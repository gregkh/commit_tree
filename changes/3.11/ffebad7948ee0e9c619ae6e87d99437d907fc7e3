[media] atmel-isi: move interface activation and deactivation to clock callbacks

When adding and removing a client, the atmel-isi camera host driver only
activates and deactivates its camera interface respectively, which doesn't
include any client-specific actions. Move this functionality into
.clock_start() and .clock_stop() callbacks.
