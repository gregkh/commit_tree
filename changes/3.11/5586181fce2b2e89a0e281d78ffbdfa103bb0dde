drm/i915: Comments for semaphore clarification

Semaphores are tied very closely to the rings in the GPU. Trivial patch
adds comments to the existing code so that when we add new rings we can
include comments there as well. It also helps distinguish the ring to
semaphore mailbox interactions by using the ringname in the semaphore
data structures.

This patch should have no functional impact.

v2: The English parts (as opposed to register names) of the comments
were reversed. (Damien)
