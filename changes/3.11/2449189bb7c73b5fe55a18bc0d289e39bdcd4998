ARM: Add .text annotations where required after __CPUINIT removal

Commit 8bd26e3a7 (arm: delete __cpuinit/__CPUINIT usage from all ARM
users) caused some code to leak into sections which are discarded
through the removal of __CPUINIT annotations.  Add appropriate .text
annotations to bring these back into the kernel text.
