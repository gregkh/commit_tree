firewire: fix libdc1394/FlyCap2 iso event regression

Commit 18d627113b83 (firewire: prevent dropping of completed iso packet
header data) was intended to be an obvious bug fix, but libdc1394 and
FlyCap2 depend on the old behaviour by ignoring all returned information
and thus not noticing that not all packets have been received yet.  The
result was that the video frame buffers would be saved before they
contained the correct data.

Reintroduce the old behaviour for old clients.
