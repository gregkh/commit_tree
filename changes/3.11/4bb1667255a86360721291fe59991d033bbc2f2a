build some drivers only when compile-testing

Some drivers can be built on more platforms than they run on. This is
a burden for users and distributors who package a kernel. They have to
manually deselect some (for them useless) drivers when updating their
configs via oldconfig. And yet, sometimes it is even impossible to
disable the drivers without patching the kernel.

Introduce a new config option COMPILE_TEST and make all those drivers
to depend on the platform they run on, or on the COMPILE_TEST option.
Now, when users/distributors choose COMPILE_TEST=n they will not have
the drivers in their allmodconfig setups, but developers still can
compile-test them with COMPILE_TEST=y.

Now the drivers where we use this new option:
* PTP_1588_CLOCK_PCH: The PCH EG20T is only compatible with Intel Atom
  processors so it should depend on x86.
* FB_GEODE: Geode is 32-bit only so only enable it for X86_32.
* USB_CHIPIDEA_IMX: The OF_DEVICE dependency will be met on powerpc
  systems -- which do not actually support the hardware via that
  method.
* INTEL_MID_PTI: It is specific to the Penwell type of Intel Atom
  device.

[v2]
* remove EXPERT dependency

[gregkh - remove chipidea portion, as it's incorrect, and also doesn't
 apply to my driver-core tree]
