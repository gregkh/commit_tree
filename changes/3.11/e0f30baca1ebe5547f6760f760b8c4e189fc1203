IB/qib: Add optional NUMA affinity

This patch adds context relative numa affinity conditioned on the
module parameter numa_aware. The qib_ctxtdata has an additional
node_id member and qib_create_ctxtdata() has an addition node_id
parameter.

The allocations within the hdr queue and eager queue setup routines
now take this additional member and adjust allocations as necesary.
PSM will pass the either current numa node or the node closest to the
HCA depending on numa_aware. Verbs will always use the node closest to
the HCA.
