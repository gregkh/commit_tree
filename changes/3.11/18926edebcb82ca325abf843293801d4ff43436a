iio: ti_am335x_adc: Allow to specify input line

The TSC part allows to specify the input lines. The IIO part assumes
that it usues always the last few, that means if IIO has adc-channels
set to 2 it will use channel 6 and 7. However it might make sense to use
only 6.
This patch changes the device property (which was introduced recently
and was never in an official release) in a way that the user can specify
which of the AIN lines should be used. In Addition to this, the name is
now AINx where x is the channel number i.e. for AIN6 we would have 6.
Prior this, it always started counting at 0 which is confusing. In
addition to this, it also checks for correct step number during reading
and does not rely on proper FIFO depth.
