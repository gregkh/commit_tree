nilfs2: fix issue with counting number of bio requests for BIO_EOPNOTSUPP error detection

Fix the issue with improper counting number of flying bio requests for
BIO_EOPNOTSUPP error detection case.

The sb_nbio must be incremented exactly the same number of times as
complete() function was called (or will be called) because
nilfs_segbuf_wait() will call wail_for_completion() for the number of
times set to sb_nbio:

  do {
      wait_for_completion(&segbuf->sb_bio_event);
  } while (--segbuf->sb_nbio > 0);

Two functions complete() and wait_for_completion() must be called the
same number of times for the same sb_bio_event.  Otherwise,
wait_for_completion() will hang or leak.
