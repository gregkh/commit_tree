KVM: s390: Use common waitqueue

Lets use the common waitqueue for kvm cpus on s390. By itself it is
just a cleanup, but it should also improve the accuracy of diag 0x44
which is implemented via kvm_vcpu_on_spin. kvm_vcpu_on_spin has
an explicit check for waiting on the waitqueue to optimize the
yielding.
