cgroup: prefix global variables with "cgroup_"

Global variable names in kernel/cgroup.c are asking for trouble -
subsys, roots, rootnode and so on.  Rename them to have "cgroup_"
prefix.

* s/subsys/cgroup_subsys/

* s/rootnode/cgroup_dummy_root/

* s/dummytop/cgroup_cummy_top/

* s/roots/cgroup_roots/

* s/root_count/cgroup_root_count/

This patch is purely cosmetic.
