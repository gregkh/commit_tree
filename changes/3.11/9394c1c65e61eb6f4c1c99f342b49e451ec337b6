ARM: 7669/1: keep __my_cpu_offset consistent with generic one

Commit 14318efb(ARM: 7587/1: implement optimized percpu variable access)
introduces arm's __my_cpu_offset to optimize percpu vaiable access,
which really works well on hackbench, but will cause __my_cpu_offset
to return garbage value before it is initialized in cpu_init() called
by setup_arch, so accessing percpu variable before setup_arch may cause
kernel hang. But generic __my_cpu_offset always returns zero before
percpu area is brought up, and won't hang kernel.

So the patch tries to clear __my_cpu_offset on boot CPU early
to avoid boot hang.

At least now percpu variable is accessed by lockdep before
setup_arch(), and enabling CONFIG_LOCK_STAT or CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCKDEP
can trigger kernel hang.
