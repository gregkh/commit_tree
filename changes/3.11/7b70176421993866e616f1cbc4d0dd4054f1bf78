Please try the following patch : It should use 2K frags instead of 4K
for normal 1500 mtu

Thanks !

[PATCH] atl1c: use custom skb allocator

We had reports ( https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54021 )
that using high order pages for skb allocations is problematic for atl1c

We do not know exactly what the problem is, but we suspect that crossing
4K pages is not well supported by this hardware.

Use a custom allocator, using page allocator and 2K fragments for
optimal stack behavior. We might make this allocator generic
in future kernels.
