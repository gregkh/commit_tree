sched: Factor out load calculation code from sched/core.c --> sched/proc.c

This large chunk of load calculation code can be easily divorced
from the main core.c scheduler file, with only a couple
prototypes and externs added to a kernel/sched header.

Some recent commits expanded the code and the documentation of
it, making it large enough to warrant separation.  For example,
see:

  556061b, "sched/nohz: Fix rq->cpu_load[] calculations"
  5aaa0b7, "sched/nohz: Fix rq->cpu_load calculations some more"
  5167e8d, "sched/nohz: Rewrite and fix load-avg computation -- again"

More importantly, it helps reduce the size of the main
sched/core.c by yet another significant amount (~600 lines).
