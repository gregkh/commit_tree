xtensa: adjust boot parameters address when INITIALIZE_XTENSA_MMU_INSIDE_VMLINUX is selected

The virtual address of boot parameters chain is passed to the kernel via
a2 register. Adjust it in case it is remapped during MMUv3 -> MMUv2
mapping change, i.e. when it is in the first 128M.

Also fix interpretation of initrd and FDT addresses passed in the boot
parameters: these are physical addresses.
