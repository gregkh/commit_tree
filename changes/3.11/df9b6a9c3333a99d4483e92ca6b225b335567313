drm: fix error routines in drm_open_helper

There are missing parts to handle error in drm_open_helper().
The priv->minor, assigned by idr_find() which can return NULL,
should be checked whether it is NULL or not before referencing it.
put_pid(), drm_gem_release(), and drm_prime_destory_file_private()
should be called when error happens after their pair functions are
called. If an error occurs after executing dev->driver->open()
which allocates driver specific per-file private data, then the
private data should be released.
