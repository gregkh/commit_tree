PCI: Work around Ivytown NTB BAR size issue

Certain NTB devices have a hardware erratum where, regardless of
pre-configured value, reading the BAR size returns 4096.  To work around
this issue, add a PCI quirk to read the appropriate values from an
alternative register in PCI config space and move the resource endpoints
to the appropriate location.
