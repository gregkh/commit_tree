NFS: Allow nfs_updatepage to extend a write under additional circumstances

Currently nfs_updatepage allows a write to be extended to cover a full
page only if we don't have a byte range lock lock on the file... but if
we have a write delegation on the file or if we have the whole file
locked for writing then we should be allowed to extend the write as
well.
