Btrfs: cleanup backref search commit root flag stuff

Looking into this backref problem I noticed we're using a macro to what turns
out to essentially be a NULL check to see if we need to search the commit root.
I'm killing this, let's just do what everybody else does and checks if trans ==
NULL.  I've also made it so we pass in the path to __resolve_indirect_refs which
will have the search_commit_root flag set properly already and that way we can
avoid allocating another path when we have a perfectly good one to use.  Thanks,
