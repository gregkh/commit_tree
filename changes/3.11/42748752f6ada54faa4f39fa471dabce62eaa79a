metag: use clear_tasks_mm_cpumask()

Checking for process->mm is not enough because process' main thread may
exit or detach its mm via use_mm(), but other threads may still have a
valid mm.

To fix this we would need to use find_lock_task_mm(), which would walk
up all threads and returns an appropriate task (with task lock held).

clear_tasks_mm_cpumask() was introduced in v3.5-rc1 to fix this issue,
so let's use it for metag too.
