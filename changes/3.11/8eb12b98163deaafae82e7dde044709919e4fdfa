mfd: vexpress: Make the driver optional for arm and arm64

The driver can be used on either arm or arm64 platforms, but
the latter doesn't have any platform-specific configuration
options, so it must be possible to manually enable the driver.

As the gpiolib is optional for arm64 arch, the gpio/led code
must be compiled conditionally.
