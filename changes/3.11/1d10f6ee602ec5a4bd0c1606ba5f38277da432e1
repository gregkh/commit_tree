x86: __force_order doesn't need to be an actual variable

It being static causes over a dozen instances to be scattered
across the kernel image, with non of them ever being referenced
in any way. Making the variable extern without ever defining it
works as well - all we need is to have the compiler think the
variable is being accessed.
