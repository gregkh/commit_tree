x86/mm: Fix boot crash with DEBUG_PAGE_ALLOC=y and more than 512G RAM

Dave Hansen reported that systems between 500G and 600G RAM
crash early if DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is selected.

It turns out that we missed increasing needed pages in BRK to
mapping initial 2M and [0,1M) when we switched to use the #PF
handler to set memory mappings:

Before that, we had the maping from [0,512M) in head_64.S, and we
can spare two pages [0-1M).  After that change, we can not reuse
pages anymore.

When we have more than 512M ram, we need an extra page for pgd page
with [512G, 1024g).

Increase pages in BRK for page table to solve the boot crash.
