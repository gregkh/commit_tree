ACPI / processor: Remove unused macros in processor_driver.c

ACPI_PROCESSOR_FILE_INFO, ACPI_PROCESSOR_FILE_THROTTLING and
ACPI_PROCESSOR_FILE_LIMIT are used for procfs, but this feature was removed
in commit d09fe555 (ACPI processor: remove deprecated ACPI procfs I/F) long
ago. So, these macros should also be removed.

ACPI_PROCESSOR_LIMIT_USER and ACPI_PROCESSOR_LIMIT_THERMAL are not used
by any code, remove them too.
