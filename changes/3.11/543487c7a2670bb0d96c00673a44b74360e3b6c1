nohz: Do not warn about unstable tsc unless user uses nohz_full

If the user enables CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL and runs the kernel on a machine
with an unstable TSC, it will produce a WARN_ON dump as well as taint
the kernel. This is a bit extreme for a kernel that just enables a
feature but doesn't use it.

The warning should only happen if the user tries to use the feature by
either adding nohz_full to the kernel command line, or by enabling
CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL_ALL that makes nohz used on all CPUs at boot up. Note,
this second feature should not (yet) be used by distros or anyone that
doesn't care if NO_HZ is used or not.
