target: Allocate aptpl_buf inside update_and_write_aptpl()

Instead of taking the buffer and length, update_and_write_aptpl() will
allocate the buffer as needed, and then free it. Instead, the function
takes an 'aptpl' boolean parameter.

This enables us to remove memory alloc/frees from struct
t10_pr_registration and other spots.

There is a slight loss of functionality because each callsite doesn't get
its own pr_debug any more, but this info can be cleaned via ftrace if
necessary and I think the shorter code is worth it.
