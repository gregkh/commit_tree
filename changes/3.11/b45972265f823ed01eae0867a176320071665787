mm: vmscan: take page buffers dirty and locked state into account

Page reclaim keeps track of dirty and under writeback pages and uses it
to determine if wait_iff_congested() should stall or if kswapd should
begin writing back pages.  This fails to account for buffer pages that
can be under writeback but not PageWriteback which is the case for
filesystems like ext3 ordered mode.  Furthermore, PageDirty buffer pages
can have all the buffers clean and writepage does no IO so it should not
be accounted as congested.

This patch adds an address_space operation that filesystems may
optionally use to check if a page is really dirty or really under
writeback.  An implementation is provided for for buffer_heads is added
and used for block operations and ext3 in ordered mode.  By default the
page flags are obeyed.

Credit goes to Jan Kara for identifying that the page flags alone are
not sufficient for ext3 and sanity checking a number of ideas on how the
problem could be addressed.
