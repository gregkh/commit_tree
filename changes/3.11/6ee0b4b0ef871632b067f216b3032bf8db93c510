ASoC: ux500: Drop pinctrl sleep support

Drop pinctrl default/sleep state switching code, as it was breaking the
capture interface by putting the I2S pins in hi-z mode regardless of its
usage status, and not giving any real benefit.

Pinctrl default mode configuration is already managed automatically by a
specific pinctrl hog.
