cgroup: replace task_cgroup_path_from_hierarchy() with task_cgroup_path()

task_cgroup_path_from_hierarchy() was added for the planned new users
and none of the currently planned users wants to know about multiple
hierarchies.  This patch drops the multiple hierarchy part and makes
it always return the path in the first non-dummy hierarchy.

As unified hierarchy will always have id 1, this is guaranteed to
return the path for the unified hierarchy if mounted; otherwise, it
will return the path from the hierarchy which happens to occupy the
lowest hierarchy id, which will usually be the first hierarchy mounted
after boot.
