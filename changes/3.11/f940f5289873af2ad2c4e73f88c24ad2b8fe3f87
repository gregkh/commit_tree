powerpc/THP: Double the PMD table size for THP

THP code does PTE page allocation along with large page request and deposit them
for later use. This is to ensure that we won't have any failures when we split
hugepages to regular pages.

On powerpc we want to use the deposited PTE page for storing hash pte slot and
secondary bit information for the HPTEs. We use the second half
of the pmd table to save the deposted PTE page.
