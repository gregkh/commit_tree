netlink: make compare exist all the time

Commit da12c90e099789a63073fc82a19542ce54d4efb9
"netlink: Add compare function for netlink_table"
only set compare at the time we create kernel netlink,
and reset compare to NULL at the time we finially
release netlink socket, but netlink_lookup wants
the compare exist always.

So we should set compare after we allocate nl_table,
and never reset it. make comapre exist all the time.
