s390/dasd: Fail all requests when DASD_FLAG_ABORTIO is set

Whenever a DASD request encounters a timeout we might
need to abort all outstanding requests on this or
even other devices.

This is especially useful if one wants to fail all
devices on one side of a RAID10 configuration, even
though only one device exhibited an error.

To handle this I've introduced a new device flag
DASD_FLAG_ABORTIO.
This flag is evaluated in __dasd_process_request_queue()
and will invoke blk_abort_request() for all
outstanding requests with DASD_CQR_FLAGS_FAILFAST set.
This will cause any of these requests to be aborted
immediately if the blk_timeout function is activated.

The DASD_FLAG_ABORTIO is also evaluated in
__dasd_process_request_queue to abort all
new request which would have the
DASD_CQR_FLAGS_FAILFAST bit set.

The flag can be set with the new ioctls 'BIODASDABORTIO'
and removed with 'BIODASDALLOWIO'.
