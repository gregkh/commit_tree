powerpc: uaccess s/might_sleep/might_fault/

The only reason uaccess routines might sleep
is if they fault. Make this explicit.

Arnd Bergmann suggested that the following code
	if (!is_kernel_addr((unsigned long)__pu_addr))
		might_fault();
can be further simplified by adding a version of might_fault
that includes the kernel addr check.

Will be considered as a further optimization in future.
