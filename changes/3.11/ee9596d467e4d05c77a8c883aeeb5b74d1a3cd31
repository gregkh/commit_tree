NFC: Add NCI over SPI send

Before any operation, driver interruption is de-asserted to prevent
race condition between TX and RX.

The NCI over SPI header is added in front of NCI packet.
If acknowledged mode is set, CRC-16-CCITT is added to the packet.
Then the packet is forwarded to SPI module to be sent.

A delay after the transaction is added.
This delay is determined by the driver during nci_spi_allocate_device()
call and can be 0.

After data has been sent, driver interruption is re-asserted.

If acknowledged mode is set, nci_spi_send will block until
acknowledgment is received.
