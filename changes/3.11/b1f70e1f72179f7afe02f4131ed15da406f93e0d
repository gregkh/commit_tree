powerpc/pseries: Add version and timestamp to oops header

Introduce version and timestamp information in the oops header.
oops_log_info (oops header) holds version (to distinguish between old
and new format oops header), length of the oops text
(compressed or uncompressed) and timestamp.

The version field will sit in the same place as the length in old
headers. version is assigned 5000 (greater than oops partition size)
so that existing tools will refuse to dump new style partitions as
the length is too large. The updated tools will work with both
old and new format headers.
