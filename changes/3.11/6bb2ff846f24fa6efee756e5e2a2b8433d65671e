x86 thermal: Disable power limit notification interrupt by default

The package power limit notification interrupt is primarily for
system diagnosis, and should not be blindly enabled on every
system by default -- particuarly since Linux does nothing in the
handler except count how many times it has been called...

Add a new kernel cmdline parameter "int_pln_enable" for situations where
users want to oberve these events via existing system counters:

$ grep TRM /proc/interrupts

$ grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/thermal_throttle/*
