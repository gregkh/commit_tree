bridge: Use the correct bit length for bitmap functions in the VLAN code

The VLAN code needs to know the length of the per-port VLAN bitmap to
perform its most basic operations (retrieving VLAN informations, removing
VLANs, forwarding database manipulation, etc). Unfortunately, in the
current implementation we are using a macro that indicates the bitmap
size in longs in places where the size in bits is expected, which in
some cases can cause what appear to be random failures.
Use the correct macro.
