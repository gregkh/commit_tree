PM / AVS: SmartReflex: use omap_sr * for errgen interfaces

SmartReflex driver interface is natively divided to two parts:

- external SmartReflex interface
- interface between SmartReflex driver and SmartReflex Class

Functions which belong to AVS class interface can use
struct omap_sr* instead of struct voltatedomain*, to provide a
direct connection between SR driver and SR class. This allows
us to optimize and not do additional lookups where none is
required.

sr_disable_errgen() and sr_configure_errgen() are interface
functions between SR driver and SR class. They are typically
used by Class driver to configure error generator module during
SmartReflex enable/disable sequence.
Now they take struct omap_sr* as input parameter.
