ipv6: drop packets with multiple fragmentation headers

It is not allowed for an ipv6 packet to contain multiple fragmentation
headers. So discard packets which were already reassembled by
fragmentation logic and send back a parameter problem icmp.

The updates for RFC 6980 will come in later, I have to do a bit more
research here.
