ext4: allow the mount options nodelalloc and data=journal

Commit 26092bf ("ext4: use a table-driven handler for mount options")
wrongly disallows the specifying the mount options nodelalloc and
data=journal simultaneously.  This is incorrect; it should have only
disallowed the combination of delalloc and data=journal
simultaneously.
