MIPS: Netlogic: SWIOTLB dma ops for 32-bit DMA

Add SWIOTLB config option and related files to Netlogic platform.

Some XLP SoC components like the SD/MMC interface cannot do DMA beyond
32-bit physical address. The SD/MMC driver can use memory outside this
range for IO, to support this we have to add bounce buffers implemented
by SWIOTLB.
