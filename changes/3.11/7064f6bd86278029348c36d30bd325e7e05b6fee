clk: tegra: provide tegra_periph_reset_assert alternative

We have some tegra device drivers that are written to be platform
independent but still use the tegra specific tegra_periph_reset_assert
function. In order to build and link them without errors,
this provides a static inline version of these functions that
does nothing when Tegra support is disabled.
