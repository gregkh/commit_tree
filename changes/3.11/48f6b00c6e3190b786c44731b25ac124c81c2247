s390/irq: store interrupt information in pt_regs

Copy the interrupt parameters from the lowcore to the pt_regs structure
in entry[64].S and reduce the arguments of the low level interrupt handler
to the pt_regs pointer only. In addition move the test-pending-interrupt
loop from do_IRQ to entry[64].S to make sure that interrupt information
is always delivered via pt_regs.
