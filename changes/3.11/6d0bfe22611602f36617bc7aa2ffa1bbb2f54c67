net: ipv6: Add IPv6 support to the ping socket.

This adds the ability to send ICMPv6 echo requests without a
raw socket. The equivalent ability for ICMPv4 was added in
2011.

Instead of having separate code paths for IPv4 and IPv6, make
most of the code in net/ipv4/ping.c dual-stack and only add a
few IPv6-specific bits (like the protocol definition) to a new
net/ipv6/ping.c. Hopefully this will reduce divergence and/or
duplication of bugs in the future.

Caveats:

- Setting options via ancillary data (e.g., using IPV6_PKTINFO
  to specify the outgoing interface) is not yet supported.
- There are no separate security settings for IPv4 and IPv6;
  everything is controlled by /proc/net/ipv4/ping_group_range.
- The proc interface does not yet display IPv6 ping sockets
  properly.

Tested with a patched copy of ping6 and using raw socket calls.
Compiles and works with all of CONFIG_IPV6={n,m,y}.
