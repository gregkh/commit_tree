tty/8250_early: Don't truncate last character of options

The earlier change to use strlcpy uncovered a bug in the options
argument length calculation causing last character to be truncated.
This makes the actual console to be configured with incorrect
baudrate when specifying the console using console=uart,... syntax.

Bug symptom seen in kernel log output:

Kernel command line: console=uart,mmio,0x90000000,115200
Early serial console at MMIO 0x90000000 (options '11520')

which then results in a invalid baud rate 11520 instead of the
expected 115200 when the console is switched to ttyS0 later
in the boot process.
