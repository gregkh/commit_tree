gpio: samsung: Remove OF support for s3c24xx

There is no users of this code and there is already a pinctrl
driver written for s3c24xx which is going to be used on any
s3c24xx DT platforms. Hence this has been effectively a dead
code in mainline.

This reverts commit 172c6a13653ac8cd6a231293b87c93821e90c1d6
gpio: samsung: add devicetree init for s3c24xx arches
