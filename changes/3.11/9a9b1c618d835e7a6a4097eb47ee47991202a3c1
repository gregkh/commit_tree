ASoC: atmel-ssc: remove clk_disable_unprepare call from critical section

clk_prepare/unprepare (and indirectly clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare)
may sleep and thus cannot be called in critical section.

This patch fix a bug introduced by commit
6f0d94790efe9f4481bbd7c174ef0e9b5e5db7c4 where clk_disable_unprepare was
called with user_lock hold.
