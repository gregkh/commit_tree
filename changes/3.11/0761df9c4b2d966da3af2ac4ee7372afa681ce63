[SCSI] sd: avoid deadlocks when running under multipath

When multipathed systems run into an all-paths-down scenario
all devices might be dropped, too. This causes 'del_gendisk'
to be called, which will unregister the kobj_map->probe()
function for all disk device numbers.
When the device comes back the default ->probe() function
is run which will call __request_module(), which will
deadlock.
As 'del_gendisk' typically does _not_ trigger a module unload
the default ->probe() function is pointless anyway.
This patch implements a dummy ->probe() function, which will
just return NULL if the disk is not registered.
This will avoid the deadlock. Plus it'll speed up device
scanning.
