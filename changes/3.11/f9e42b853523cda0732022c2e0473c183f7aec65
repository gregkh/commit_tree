net: sctp: sideeffect: throw BUG if primary_path is NULL

This clearly states a BUG somewhere in the SCTP code as e.g. fixed once
in f28156335 ("sctp: Use correct sideffect command in duplicate cookie
handling"). If this ever happens, throw a trace in the sideeffect engine
where assocs clearly must have a primary_path assigned.

When in sctp_seq_dump_local_addrs() also throw a WARN and bail out since
we do not need to panic for printing this one asterisk. Also, it will
avoid the not so obvious case when primary != NULL test passes and at a
later point in time triggering a NULL ptr dereference caused by primary.
While at it, also fix up the white space.
