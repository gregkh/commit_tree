x86, mcheck, therm_throt: Process package thresholds

Added callback registration for package threshold reports. Also added
a callback to check the rate control implemented in callback or not.
If there is no rate control implemented, then there is a default rate
control similar to core threshold notification by delaying for
CHECK_INTERVAL (5 minutes) between reports.
