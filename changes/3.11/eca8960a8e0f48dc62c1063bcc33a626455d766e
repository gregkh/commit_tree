spi: fix incorrect handling of min param in SPI_BPW_RANGE_MASK

SPI_BPW_RANGE_MASK is intended to work by calculating two masks; one
representing support for all bits up-to-and-including the "max" supported
value, and one representing support for all bits up-to-but-not-including
the "min" supported value, and then taking the difference between the
two, resulting in a mask representing support for all bits between
(inclusive) the min and max values.

However, the second mask ended up representing all bits up-to-and-
including rather up-to-but-not-including. Fix this bug.
