uvesafb: Clean up MTRR code

The old code allowed very strange memory types.  Now it works like
all the other video drivers: ioremap_wc is used unconditionally,
and MTRRs are set if PAT is unavailable (unless MTRR is disabled
by a module parameter).

UC, WB, and WT support is gone.  If there are MTRR conflicts that prevent
addition of a WC MTRR, adding a non-conflicting MTRR is pointless; it's
better to just turn off MTRR support entirely.

As an added bonus, any MTRR added is freed on unload.
