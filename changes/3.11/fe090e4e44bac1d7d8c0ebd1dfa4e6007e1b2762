cifs: file: initialize oparms.reconnect before using it

In the cifs_reopen_file function, if the following statement is
asserted:

(tcon->unix_ext && cap_unix(tcon->ses) &&
            (CIFS_UNIX_POSIX_PATH_OPS_CAP &
            (tcon->fsUnixInfo.Capability)))

and we succeed to open with cifs_posix_open, the function jumps
to the label reopen_success and checks for oparms.reconnect
which is not initialized.
