pinctrl: establish pull-up/pull-down terminology

It is counter-intuitive to have "0" mean disable in a boolean
manner for electronic properties of pins such as pull-up and
pull-down. Therefore, define that a pull-up/pull-down argument
of 0 to such a generic option means that the pin is
short-circuited to VDD or GROUND. Pull disablement shall be
done using PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE.
