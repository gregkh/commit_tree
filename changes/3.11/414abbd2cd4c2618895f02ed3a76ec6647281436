[media] media: dmxdev: remove dvb_ringbuffer_flush() on writer side

In dvb_ringbuffer lock-less synchronizationof reader and writer threads is done
with separateread and write pointers. Sincedvb_ringbuffer_flush() modifies the
read pointer, this function must not be called from the writer thread.
This patch removes the dvb_ringbuffer_flush() calls in the dmxdev ringbuffer
write functions, this fixes Oopses "Unable to handle kernel paging request"
I could observe for the call chaindvb_demux_read ->dvb_dmxdev_buffer_read ->
dvb_ringbuffer_read_user -> __copy_to_user (the reader side of the ringbuffer).
The flush calls at the write side are not necessary anyway since ringbuffer_flush
is also called in dvb_dmxdev_buffer_read() when an error condition is set in the
ringbuffer.
This patch should also be applied to stable kernels.
