ARM: shmobile: Marzen: pass platform data to USB PHY device

Since we're now going to setup the USBPCTRL0 register using the USB PHY device's
platform data, we now need a way to pass those platform data from the board file
to the device which is situated in setup-r8a7779.c -- and what I'm suggesting is
r8a7779_add_usb_phy_device() that will register USB PHY platform device with the
passed platform data using platform_device_register_resndata() call; creating
this function involves deletion of 'usb_phy_device' from r8a7779_devices_dt[],
so that it will no longer be registered for the generic R8A7779 machine (where
we can't provide the platform data anyway), hence EHCI/OHCI drivers will fail
to load as well.

For the Marzen board, this new function will be called from marzen_init() to
register the USB PHY device early enough.

Note that the board and the SoC code have to be in one patch to keep the code
bisectable...

The patch has been tested on the Marzen board.
