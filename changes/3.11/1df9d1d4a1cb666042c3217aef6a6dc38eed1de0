staging:iio:ad7291: Rework regulator handling

Add platform_data for the driver which allows to specify whether an external
reference voltage is used or not. It is not possible to use the return value of
regulator_get() for this since the regulator framework is able to return a dummy
regulator in case no regulator has been specified. In this case the driver will
always get a valid regulator, no matter if it has been specified or not.  Also
make the regulator non-optional if platform_data states that an external
reference voltage should be used.
