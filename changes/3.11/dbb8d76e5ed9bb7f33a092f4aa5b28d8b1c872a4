cpufreq: tegra: create CONFIG_ARM_TEGRA_CPUFREQ

currently Tegra cpufreq driver gets built based on ARCH_TEGRA, which doesn't
depend on nor select CPU_FREQ itself, so:

        select CPU_FREQ_TABLE if CPU_FREQ

... isn't guaranteed to fire.

The correct solution seems to be:

* Add CONFIG_ARM_TEGRA_CPUFREQ to drivers/cpufreq/Kconfig.arm.
* Make that Kconfig option selct CPU_FREQ_TABLE.
* Make that Kconfig option be def_bool ARCH_TEGRA.
* Modify drivers/cpufreq/Makefile to build tegra-cpufreq.c based on that.
* Remove all the cpufreq-related stuff from arch/arm/mach-tegra/Kconfig.

That way, tegra-cpufreq.c can't be built if !CPU_FREQ, and Tegra's
cpufreq works the same way as all the other cpufreq drivers.

This patch does it.
