debugfs: write_file_bool() - ensure strtobool() operates on valid data

In case, userland writes an empty string to a bool debugfs file, buf[]
will still be uninitialized when being passed to strtobool() making the
outcome of that function purely random.

Fix this by always zero-terminating the buffer.
