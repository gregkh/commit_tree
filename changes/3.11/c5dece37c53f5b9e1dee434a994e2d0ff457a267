ARM: sirf: use CONFIG_SIRF rather than CONFIG_PRIMA2 where necessary

I got a build error today that made me realize that it is not
possible to build a kernel for a SiRF platform without enabling
CONFIG_PRIMA2, since a lot of common code depends on CONFIG_PRIMA2.

This fixes all occurences that appear like common SiRF code.
