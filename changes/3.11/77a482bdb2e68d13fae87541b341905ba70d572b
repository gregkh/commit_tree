ip_gre: fix ipgre_header to return correct offset

Fix ipgre_header() (header_ops->create) to return the correct
amount of bytes pushed. Most callers of dev_hard_header() seem
to care only if it was success, but af_packet.c uses it as
offset to the skb to copy from userspace only once. In practice
this fixes packet socket sendto()/sendmsg() to gre tunnels.

Regression introduced in c54419321455631079c7d6e60bc732dd0c5914c5
("GRE: Refactor GRE tunneling code.")
