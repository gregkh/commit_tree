Revert "HID: hid-logitech-dj: querying_devices was never set"

This reverts commit 407a2c2a4d85100c8c67953e4bac2f4a6c942335.

Explanation provided by Benjamin Tissoires:

Commit "HID: hid-logitech-dj, querying_devices was never set" activate
a flag which guarantees that we do not ask the receiver for too many
enumeration. When the flag is set, each following enumeration call is
discarded (the usb request is not forwarded to the receiver). The flag
is then released when the driver receive a pairing information event,
which normally follows the enumeration request.
However, the USB3 bug makes the driver think the enumeration request
has been forwarded to the receiver. However, it is actually not the
case because the USB stack returns -EPIPE. So, when a new unknown
device appears, the workaround consisting in asking for a new
enumeration is not working anymore: this new enumeration is discarded
because of the flag, which is never reset.

A solution could be to trigger a timeout before releasing it, but for
now, let's just revert the patch.
