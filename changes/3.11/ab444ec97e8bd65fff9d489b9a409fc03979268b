powerpc/pci: Partial tree hotplug support

When EEH error happens to one specific PE, the device drivers
of its attached EEH devices (PCI devices) are checked to see
the further action: reset with complete hotplug, or reset without
hotplug. However, that's not enough for those PCI devices whose
drivers can't support EEH, or those PCI devices without driver.
So we need do so-called "partial hotplug" on basis of PCI devices.
In the situation, part of PCI devices of the specific PE are
unplugged and plugged again after PE reset.

The patch changes pcibios_add_pci_devices() so that it can support
full hotplug and so-called "partial" hotplug based on device-tree
or real hardware. It's notable that pci_of_scan.c has been changed
for a bit in order to support the "partial" hotplug based on dev-tree.

Most of the generic code already supports that, we just need to
plumb it properly on our side.
