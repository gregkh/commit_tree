jme: lower NAPI weight

Since commit 82dc3c63 ("net: introduce NAPI_POLL_WEIGHT")
netif_napi_add() produces an error message if a NAPI poll weight
greater than 64 is requested.

jme requests a quarter of the rx ring size as the NAPI weight.
jme's rx ring size is 1 << 9 = 512.

Use the standard NAPI weight.
