rcu: Simplify RCU_TINY RCU callback invocation

TINY_PREEMPT_RCU could use a kthread to handle RCU callback invocation,
which required an API to abstract kthread vs. softirq invocation.
Now that TINY_PREEMPT_RCU is no longer with us, this commit retires
this API in favor of direct use of the relevant softirq primitives.
