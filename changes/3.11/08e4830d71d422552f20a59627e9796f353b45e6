ARM: OMAP5: hwmod data: Create initial OMAP5 SOC hwmod data

Adding the hwmod data for OMAP54xx SOCs.

Additional changes done on top of initial SOC data files.
- The IO resource information like dma request lines, irq number and
ocp address space can be populated via dt blob. So such data is stripped
from OMAP5 SOC hwmod data file.

- SDMA IO resource information is still kept since dmaengine work
is till ongoing. Once the legacy dma platform driver becomes obsolete,
SDMA io space information can be removed.

- The devices like dss, aess, usb which are missing the device tree bindings,
hwmod data is not added since OMAP5 is DT only build. When such devices add
the dt bindings, respective hwmod data can be added along with it.

With above update, we now need about ~2000 loc vs ~6000 loc with previous
version of the patch for OMAP5 hwmod data file. Ofcourse with addition of
few more drivers it can go upto ~2400 loc which is still better than the
earlier version.
