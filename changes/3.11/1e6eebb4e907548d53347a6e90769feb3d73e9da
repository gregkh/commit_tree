usb: musb: ux500: take the dma_mask from coherent_dma_mask

The dma_mask will always be the same as the coherent_dma_mask, so let's
cut down on the platform_data burden and set it as such in the driver.
This also saves us from supporting it separately when we come to enable
this driver for Device Tree.
