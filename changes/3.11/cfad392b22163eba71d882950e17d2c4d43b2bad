Btrfs: check to see if root_list is empty before adding it to dead roots

A user reported a panic when running with autodefrag and deleting snapshots.
This is because we could end up trying to add the root to the dead roots list
twice.  To fix this check to see if we are empty before adding ourselves to the
dead roots list.  Thanks,
