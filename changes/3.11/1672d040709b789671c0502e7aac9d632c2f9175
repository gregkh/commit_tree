cgroup: fix cgroupfs_root early destruction path

cgroupfs_root used to have ->actual_subsys_mask in addition to
->subsys_mask.  a8a648c4ac ("cgroup: remove
cgroup->actual_subsys_mask") removed it noting that the subsys_mask is
essentially temporary and doesn't belong in cgroupfs_root; however,
the patch made it impossible to tell whether a cgroupfs_root actually
has the subsystems bound or just have the bits set leading to the
following BUG when trying to mount with subsystems which are already
mounted elsewhere.

We still want rebind_subsystems() to take added/removed masks, so
let's fix it by marking whether a cgroupfs_root has finished binding
or not.  Also, document what's going on around ->subsys_mask
initialization so that similar mistakes aren't repeated.
