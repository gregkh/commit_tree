gre: Fix MTU sizing check for gretap tunnels

This change fixes an MTU sizing issue seen with gretap tunnels when non-gso
packets are sent from the interface.

In my case I was able to reproduce the issue by simply sending a ping of
1421 bytes with the gretap interface created on a device with a standard
1500 mtu.

This fix is based on the fact that the tunnel mtu is already adjusted by
dev->hard_header_len so it would make sense that any packets being compared
against that mtu should also be adjusted by hard_header_len and the tunnel
header instead of just the tunnel header.
