ext4: fix mount/remount error messages for incompatible mount options

Commit 5688978 ("ext4: improve handling of conflicting mount options")
introduced incorrect messages shown while choosing wrong mount options.

First of all, both cases of incorrect mount options,
"data=journal,delalloc" and "data=journal,dioread_nolock" result in
the same error message.

Secondly, the problem above isn't solved for remount option: the
mismatched parameter is simply ignored.  Moreover, ext4_msg states
that remount with options "data=journal,delalloc" succeeded, which is
not true.

To fix it up, I added a simple check after parse_options() call to
ensure that data=journal and delalloc/dioread_nolock parameters are
not present at the same time.
