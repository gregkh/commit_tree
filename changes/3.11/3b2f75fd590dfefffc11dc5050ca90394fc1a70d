staging/lustre/ost: check pre 2.4 echo client in obdo validation

Because old echo client still uses o_id/o_seq for objid,
but new echo client will uses FID for the objid. Add
OBD_CONNECT_FID for 2.4 echo client, so 2.4 OST will
convert o_id/o_seq to FID if the request from old echo
client.

Add local flag OBD_FL_OSTID for o_flags to indicate
OST does not support FID yet, then echo client will
still send o_id/o_seq to OST.

cleanup ost_validate_obdo
