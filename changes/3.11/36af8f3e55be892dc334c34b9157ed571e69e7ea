ARM: mxc: fix gpio-ranges for VF610

The gpio-ranges properties in vf610.dtsi were written according to an
older version of the GPIO bindings. Unfortunately, these were changed
incompatibly in commit 86853c8 "gpio: add gpio offset in gpio range
cells property". This patch adds the missing required extra cell in each
gpio-ranges property.
