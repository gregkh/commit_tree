xen-blkback: expand map/unmap functions

Preparatory change for implementing indirect descriptors. Change
xen_blkbk_{map/unmap} in order to be able to map/unmap a random amount
of grants (previously it was limited to
BLKIF_MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_REQUEST). Also, remove the usage of pending_req
in the map/unmap functions, so we can map/unmap grants without needing
to pass a pending_req.
