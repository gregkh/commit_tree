ptrace/x86: revert "hw_breakpoints: Fix racy access to ptrace breakpoints"

This reverts commit 87dc669ba257 ("hw_breakpoints: Fix racy access to
ptrace breakpoints").

The patch was fine but we can no longer race with SIGKILL after commit
9899d11f6544 ("ptrace: ensure arch_ptrace/ptrace_request can never race
with SIGKILL"), the __TASK_TRACED tracee can't be woken up and
->ptrace_bps[] can't go away.

The patch only removes ptrace_get_breakpoints/ptrace_put_breakpoints and
does a couple of "while at it" cleanups, it doesn't remove other changes
from the reverted commit.
