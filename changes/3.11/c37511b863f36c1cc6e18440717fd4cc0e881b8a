bcache: Fix/revamp tracepoints

The tracepoints were reworked to be more sensible, and fixed a null
pointer deref in one of the tracepoints.

Converted some of the pr_debug()s to tracepoints - this is partly a
performance optimization; it used to be that with DEBUG or
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG pr_debug() was an empty macro; but at some point it
was changed to an empty inline function.

Some of the pr_debug() statements had rather expensive function calls as
part of the arguments, so this code was getting run unnecessarily even
on non debug kernels - in some fast paths, too.
