Input: sysrq - request graceful shutdown for key reset

Attempt to reboot the system gracefully when a key combo is detected.
If the reste combination is pressed the 2nd time we assume that graceful
reboot failed and perform emergency reboot. This fucntionality is useful
when UI is stuck but the system is otherwise working fine.
