tracing: Change tracing_fops/snapshot_fops to rely on tracing_get_cpu()

tracing_open() and tracing_snapshot_open() are racy, the memory
inode->i_private points to can be already freed.

Convert these last users of "inode->i_private == trace_cpu" to
use "i_private = trace_array" and rely on tracing_get_cpu().

v2: incorporate the fix from Steven, tracing_release() must not
    blindly dereference file->private_data unless we know that
    the file was opened for reading.
