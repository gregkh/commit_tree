Btrfs: do not offset physical if we're compressed

xfstest btrfs/276 was freaking out on slower boxes partly because fiemap was
offsetting the physical based on the extent offset.  This is perfectly fine with
uncompressed extents, however the extent offset is into the uncompressed area,
not the compressed.  So we can return a physical value that isn't at all within
the area we have allocated on disk.  Fix this by returning the start of the
extent if it is compressed no matter what the offset.  Thanks,
