memcg: don't initialize kmem-cache destroying work for root caches

struct memcg_cache_params has a union.  Different parts of this union
are used for root and non-root caches.  A part with destroying work is
used only for non-root caches.

I fixed the same problem in another place v3.9-rc1-16204-gf101a94, but
didn't notice this one.

This patch fixes the kernel panic:
