drm/i915: Fix VLV PLL LPF coefficients for DAC

The current PLL settings produce a rather unstable picture when
I hook up a VLV to my HP ZR24w display via a VGA cable.

According to VLV2A0_DP_eDP_HDMI_DPIO_driver_vbios_notes_9, we should
use the the same LPF coefficients for DAC as we do for HDMI and RBR DP.
And indeed that seems to cure the shivers.
