dmaengine: ste_dma40: Rectify incorrect configuration validation checking

If we compare an event's group (dev_type / 16) with STEDMA40_DEV_DST_MEMORY
(-1), the only way we'd obtain a positive result is if we passed -16 as a
device type, which is unfeasible. Instead, it would be much more sane to
compare STEDMA40_DEV_DST_MEMORY against the raw dev_type in order to expect
the expected result.
