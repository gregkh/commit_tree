staging/lustre/ldlm: suppress useless lock RPC for layout

In ldlm_lock_decref_internal() when l_lvb_data is freed to
reduce memory consumption, LDLM_FL_LVB_READY is not
cleared, so later when the lock is reused lvb is not
updated. But clearing LDLM_FL_LVB_READY forces layout refetch
at each file access, so the better is to remove the optimization.
The use case is after a restore in HSM.
