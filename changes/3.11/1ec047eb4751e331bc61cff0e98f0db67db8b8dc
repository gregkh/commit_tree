ipv6: introduce per-interface counter for dad-completed ipv6 addresses

To reduce the number of unnecessary router solicitations, MLDv2 and IGMPv3
messages we need to track the number of valid (as in non-optimistic,
no-dad-failed and non-tentative) link-local addresses. Therefore, this
patch implements a valid_ll_addr_cnt in struct inet6_dev.

We now only emit router solicitations if the first link-local address
finishes duplicate address detection.

The changes for MLDv2 and IGMPv3 are in a follow-up patch.

While there, also simplify one if statement(one minor nit I made in one
of my previous patches):

if (!...)
	do();
else
	return;

<<into>>

if (...)
	return;
do();
