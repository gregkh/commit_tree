ARM: 7788/1: elf: fix lpae hwcap feature reporting in proc/cpuinfo

Commit a469abd0f868 ("ARM: elf: add new hwcap for identifying atomic
ldrd/strd instructions") added a new hwcap to identify LPAE on CPUs
which support it. Whilst the hwcap data is correct, the string reported
in /proc/cpuinfo actually matches on HWCAP_VFPD32, which was missing
an entry in the string table.

This patch fixes this problem by adding a "vfpd32" string at the correct
offset, preventing us from falsely advertising LPAE on CPUs which do not
support it.
