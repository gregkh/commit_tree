ARM: OMAP: fix dsi regulator names

board-cm-t35.c and board-ldp.c contain regulator supply entries for
vdds_dsi. However, the given device name is wrong.

This patch fixes the device name from omapdss_dsi1 to omapdss_dsi.0.

Note that as far as I know, DSI driver is not used on these boards, so
this should not have caused any problems. The DSI block can be used to
generate clock for DPI, though, but that's not enabled for omap3 boards
currently.
