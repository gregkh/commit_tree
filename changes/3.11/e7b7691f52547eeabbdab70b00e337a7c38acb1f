staging: wlags49_h2: fix up "205179d staging: wlags49_h2: strncpy, need checking the memory length" for avoiding warnings

Type of 'probe_rsp->rawData[1]' is 'hcf_8' which is 'u8', it will
compare with 'int', so use min_t() to cast to 'u8' to avoid related
warning.

If use min(), it has '(void) (&_min1 == &_min2);', so if no type cast,
the compiler will report 'pointer types lacks a cast':
