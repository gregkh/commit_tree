nfsd4: allow client to send no cb_sec flavors

In testing I notice that some of the pynfs tests forget to send any
cb_sec flavors, and that we haven't necessarily errored out in that case
before.

I'll fix pynfs, but am also inclined to default to trying AUTH_NONE in
that case in case this is something clients actually do.
