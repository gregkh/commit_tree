HID: fix false positive out of range values

Commit 6da7066906e977d42104a859c490f5f9a300488c introduced in 3.3
"HID: ignore absolute values which don't fit between logical min and max"
prevents some Posiflex touch screen to work because they do not provide
logical min and max for their buttons.
Thus, logical min and max are at 0, discarding the buttons events, and
preventing the device to report appropriate X Y.

Adding a check on "min < max" solves the problem.
