ext4: fix overflow when counting used blocks on 32-bit architectures

The arithmetics adding delalloc blocks to the number of used blocks in
ext4_getattr() can easily overflow on 32-bit archs as we first multiply
number of blocks by blocksize and then divide back by 512. Make the
arithmetics more clever and also use proper type (unsigned long long
instead of unsigned long).
