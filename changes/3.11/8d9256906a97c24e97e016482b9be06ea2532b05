xen/io/ring.h: new macro to detect whether there are too many requests on the ring

Backends may need to protect themselves against an insane number of
produced requests stored by a frontend, in case they iterate over
requests until reaching the req_prod value. There can't be more
requests on the ring than the difference between produced requests
and produced (but possibly not yet published) responses.

This is a more strict alternative to a patch previously posted by
