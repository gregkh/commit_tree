powerpc/powernv: Use dev-node in PCI config accessors

Currently, we're using the combo (PCI bus + devfn) in the PCI
config accessors and PCI config accessors in EEH depends on them.
However, it's not safe to refer the PCI bus which might have been
removed during hotplug. So we're using device node in the PCI
config accessors and the corresponding backends just reuse them.

The patch also fix one potential risk: We possiblly have frozen
PE during the early PCI probe time, but we haven't setup the PE
mapping yet. So the errors should be counted to PE#0.
