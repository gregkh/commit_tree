libata: make it clear that sata_inic162x is experimental

sata_inic162x never reached a state where it's reliable enough for
production use and data corruption is a relatively common occurrence.
Make the driver generate warning about the issues and mark the Kconfig
option as experimental.

If the situation doesn't improve, we'd be better off making it depend
on CONFIG_BROKEN.  Let's wait for several cycles and see if the kernel
message draws any attention.
