ARM: tegra: defconfig updates

Enable some new features:
* The Tegra114 SPI controller, for Dalmore's SPI flash.
* Set all the GPIO leds triggers to their "if you don't know, say X"
  value, so there are some useful triggers for the gpio-leds support.
* TPS65090 charger, for Dalmore.
* ASoC RT5640 machine driver, for audio on Beaver and Dalmore.

Also, rebuild tegra_defconfig on top of linux-next. This should make it
easier to create future defconfig patches, without extraneous diffs.
This should introduce no changes; simply moving entries around due to
Kconfig ordering changes. The apparent exceptions are:

* AUTO_ZRELADDR: Selected by ARM multi-platform support.
* MTD_CHAR: Removed in Kconfig.
