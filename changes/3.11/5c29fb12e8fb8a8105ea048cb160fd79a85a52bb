ipv6: only apply anti-spoofing checks to not-pointopoint tunnels

Because of commit 218774dc341f219bfcf940304a081b121a0e8099 ("ipv6: add
anti-spoofing checks for 6to4 and 6rd") the sit driver dropped packets
for 2002::/16 destinations and sources even when configured to work as a
tunnel with fixed endpoint. We may only apply the 6rd/6to4 anti-spoofing
checks if the device is not in pointopoint mode.

This was an oversight from me in the above commit, sorry.  Thanks to
Roman Mamedov for reporting this!
