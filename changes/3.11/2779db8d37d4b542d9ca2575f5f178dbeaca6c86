genirq: Fix can_request_irq() for IRQs without an action

Commit 02725e7471b8 ('genirq: Use irq_get/put functions'),
inadvertently changed can_request_irq() to return 0 for IRQs that have
no action.  This causes pcibios_lookup_irq() to select only IRQs that
already have an action with IRQF_SHARED set, or to fail if there are
none.  Change can_request_irq() to return 1 for IRQs that have no
action (if the first two conditions are met).
