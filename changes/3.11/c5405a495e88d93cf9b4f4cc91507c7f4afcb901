sched: Remove redundant update_runtime notifier

migration_call() will do all the things that update_runtime() does.
So let's remove it.

Furthermore, there is potential risk that the current code will catch
BUG_ON at line 689 of rt.c when do cpu hotplug while there are realtime
threads running because of enabling runtime twice while the rt_runtime
may already changed.
