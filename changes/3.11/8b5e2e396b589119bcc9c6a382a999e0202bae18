ASoC: blackfin: bf5xx-i2s: Add support for TDM mode

The bf5xx-i2s{,-pcm} and bf5xx-tdm{-pcm} drivers are nearly identical. Both are
for the same hardware each supporting a slight different subset of the hardware.
The bf5xx-i2s driver supports 2 channel I2S mode while the bf5xx-tdm driver
supports TDM mode and channel remapping. This patch adds support for TDM mode
and channel remapping to the bf5xx-i2s driver so that we'll eventually be able
to retire the bf5xx-tdm driver. Unfortunately the hardware is fixed to using 8
channels in TDM mode. The bf5xx-tdm driver jumps through a few hoops to make it
work well with other channel counts as well:
	* Don't support mmap
	* Translate between internal frame size (which is always 8 * sample_size)
	  and ALSA frame size (which depends on the channel count)
	* Have special copy and silence callbacks which are aware of the mismatch
	  between internal and ALSA frame size
	* Reduce the maximum buffer size to ensure that there is enough headroom for
	  dummy data.

The bf5xx-i2s driver is going to use the same mechanisms when being used int
TDM mode.
