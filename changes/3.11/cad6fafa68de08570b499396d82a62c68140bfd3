staging/lustre/osc: some cleanup to reduce stack overflow chance

ptlrpcd_add_req() will wake_up other process, do not hold a spinlock
before calling ptlrpcd_queue_work()->ptlrpcd_add_req().

If current process is allocating memory, memory shrinker could get to
osc_lru_del(), don't call osc_lru_shrink() further since it could
lead a long calling chain.

Use static string OES_STRINGS in OSC_EXTENT_DUMP() to reduce stack
footprint.

Alloc crattr on heap for osc_build_rpc() to reduce stack footprint.
