fuse: readdirplus: fix dentry leak

In case d_lookup() returns a dentry with d_inode == NULL, the dentry is not
returned with dput(). This results in triggering a BUG() in
shrink_dcache_for_umount_subtree():

  BUG: Dentry ...{i=0,n=...} still in use (1) [unmount of fuse fuse]

[SzM: need to d_drop() as well]
