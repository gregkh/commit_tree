[SCSI] sd: Update WRITE SAME heuristics

SATA drives located behind a SAS controller would incorrectly receive
WRITE SAME commands. Tweak the heuristics so that:

 - If REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES is provided we will use that to
   choose between WRITE SAME(16), WRITE SAME(10) and disabled. This also
   fixes an issue with the old code which would issue WRITE SAME(10)
   despite the command not being whitelisted in REPORT SUPPORTED
   OPERATION CODES.

 - If REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES is not provided we will fall back
   to WRITE SAME(10) unless the device has an ATA Information VPD page.
   The assumption is that a SATL which is smart enough to implement
   WRITE SAME would also provide REPORT SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES.

To facilitate the new heuristics scsi_report_opcode() has been modified
to so we can distinguish between "operation not supported" and "RSOC not
supported".
