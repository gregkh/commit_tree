ARM: shmobile: BOCK-W: fix SDHI0 PFC settings

The following message is printed on the BOCK-W kernel bootup:

sh-pfc pfc-r8a7778: invalid group "sdhi0" for function "sdhi0"

In addition, SD card cannot be detected.  The reason is apparently that commit
ca7bb309485e4ec89a9addd47bea (ARM: shmobile: bockw: add SDHI0 support) matched
the previous version of commit 564617d2f92473031d035deb273da5 (sh-pfc: r8a7778:
add SDHI support).

Add the missing pin groups according to the BOCK-W board schematics.
