hpfs: better test for errors

The test if bitmap access is out of bound could errorneously pass if the
device size is divisible by 16384 sectors and we are asking for one bitmap
after the end.

Check for invalid size in the superblock. Invalid size could cause integer
overflows in the rest of the code.
