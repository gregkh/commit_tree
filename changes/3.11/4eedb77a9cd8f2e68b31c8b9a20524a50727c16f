locking: Fix copy/paste errors of "ARCH_INLINE_*_UNLOCK_BH"

The Kconfig symbols ARCH_INLINE_READ_UNLOCK_IRQ,
ARCH_INLINE_SPIN_UNLOCK_IRQ, and ARCH_INLINE_WRITE_UNLOCK_IRQ were added
in v2.6.33, but have never actually been used. Ingo Molnar spotted that
this is caused by three identical copy/paste erros. Eg, the Kconfig
entry for

    INLINE_READ_UNLOCK_IRQ

has an (optional) dependency on:

    ARCH_INLINE_READ_UNLOCK_BH

were it apparently should depend on:

    ARCH_INLINE_READ_UNLOCK_IRQ

instead. Likewise for the Kconfig entries for INLINE_SPIN_UNLOCK_IRQ and
INLINE_WRITE_UNLOCK_IRQ. Fix these three errors.

This never really caused any real problems as these symbols are set (or
unset) in a group - but it's worth fixing it nevertheless.
