9P: Add cancelled() to the transport functions.

RDMA needs to post a buffer for each incoming reply.
Hence it needs to keep count of these and needs to be
aware of whether a flushed request has received a reply
or not.

This patch adds the cancelled() callback to the transport modules.
It is called when RFLUSH has been received and that the corresponding
request will never receive a reply.
