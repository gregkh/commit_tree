tracing: Change event_enable/disable_read() to verify i_private != NULL

tracing_open_generic_file() is racy, ftrace_event_file can be
already freed by rmdir or trace_remove_event_call().

Change event_enable_read() and event_disable_read() to read and
verify "file = i_private" under event_mutex.

This fixes nothing, but now we can change debugfs_remove("enable")
callers to nullify ->i_private and fix the the problem.
