dm ioctl: set noio flag to avoid __vmalloc deadlock

Set noio flag while calling __vmalloc() because it doesn't fully respect
gfp flags to avoid a possible deadlock (see commit
502624bdad3dba45dfaacaf36b7d83e39e74b2d2).

This should be backported to stable kernels 3.8 and newer. The kernel 3.8
doesn't have memalloc_noio_save(), so we should set and restore process
flag PF_MEMALLOC instead.
