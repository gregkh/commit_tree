drm/i915: protect backlight registers and data with a spinlock

Backlight data and registers are fiddled through LVDS/eDP modeset
enable/disable hooks, backlight sysfs files, asle interrupts, and register
save/restore. Protect the backlight related registers and driver private
fields using a spinlock.

The locking in register save/restore covers a little more than is strictly
necessary, including non-modeset case, for simplicity.

v2: Cover register access, save/restore, i915_read_blc_pwm_ctl() and code
    paths leading there.
