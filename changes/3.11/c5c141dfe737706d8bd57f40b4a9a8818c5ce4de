staging: rts5139: Fix SD card detection on Samsung NP730U3E Ultrabook

The timeout detection implemented in this driver isn't very
robust. Although the USB interrupt transfer was successful,
the polling thread often reported timeouts because the 50ms
had expired before it got scheduled, and the SD card wasn't
detected. Increasing it to 100ms, as used in other places of
this driver, makes it work.
