ARM: 7782/1: Kconfig: Let ARM_ERRATA_364296 not depend on CONFIG_SMP

imx_v6_v7_defconfig handles both multi-core and single-core SoCs, and it has CONFIG_SMP=y selected by default.

With such config we cannot select ARM_ERRATA_364296, as it depends on !SMP.

Let ARM_ERRATA_364296 be undependent on CONFIG_SMP, so that we can select this erratum for the ARM1136 SoCs, even if CONFIG_SMP=y is enabled.
