s390/airq: simplify adapter interrupt code

There are three users of adapter interrupts: AP, QDIO and PCI. Each
registers a single adapter interrupt with independent ISCs. Define
a "struct airq" with the interrupt handler, a pointer and a mask for
the local summary indicator and the ISC for the adapter interrupt
source. Convert the indicator array with its fixed number of adapter
interrupt sources per ISE to an array of hlists. This removes the
limitation to 32 adapter interrupts per ISC and allows for arbitrary
memory locations for the local summary indicator.
