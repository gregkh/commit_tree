ipv4: sendto/hdrincl: don't use destination address found in header

ipv4: raw_sendmsg: don't use header's destination address

A sendto() regression was bisected and found to start with commit
f8126f1d5136be1 (ipv4: Adjust semantics of rt->rt_gateway.)

The problem is that it tries to ARP-lookup the constructed packet's
destination address rather than the explicitly provided address.

Fix this using FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH so that given nexthop is used.

cf. commit 2ad5b9e4bd314fc685086b99e90e5de3bc59e26b
