consolidate compilation option configs

Again, trying to come up with some common themes of the stuff in
the kernel hacking menu...  There are quite a few options to
tweak compilation in some way, or perform extra compile-time
checks.  Give them their own menu.

The diff here looks a bit funny... makes it look like I'm
moving debugfs even though I'm actually moving the options on
either side of it.
