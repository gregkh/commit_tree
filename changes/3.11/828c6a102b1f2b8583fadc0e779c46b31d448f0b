Revert "serial: 8250_pci: add support for another kind of NetMos Technology PCI 9835 Multi-I/O Controller"

This reverts commit 8d2f8cd424ca0b99001f3ff4f5db87c4e525f366.

As reported by Stefan, this device already works with the parport_serial
driver, so the 8250_pci driver should not also try to grab it as well.
