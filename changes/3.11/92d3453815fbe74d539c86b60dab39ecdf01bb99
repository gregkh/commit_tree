virtio: console: fix raising SIGIO after port unplug

SIGIO should be sent when a port gets unplugged.  It should only be sent
to prcesses that have the port opened, and have asked for SIGIO to be
delivered.  We were clearing out guest_connected before calling
send_sigio_to_port(), resulting in a sigio not getting sent to
processes.

Fix by setting guest_connected to false after invoking the sigio
function.
