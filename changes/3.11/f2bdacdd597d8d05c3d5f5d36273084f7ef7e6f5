vmcore: allocate buffer for ELF headers on page-size alignment

Allocate ELF headers on page-size boundary using __get_free_pages()
instead of kmalloc().

Later patch will merge PT_NOTE entries into a single unique one and
decrease the buffer size actually used.  Keep original buffer size in
variable elfcorebuf_sz_orig to kfree the buffer later and actually used
buffer size with rounded up to page-size boundary in variable
elfcorebuf_sz separately.

The size of part of the ELF buffer exported from /proc/vmcore is
elfcorebuf_sz.

The merged, removed PT_NOTE entries, i.e.  the range [elfcorebuf_sz,
elfcorebuf_sz_orig], is filled with 0.

Use size of the ELF headers as an initial offset value in
set_vmcore_list_offsets_elf{64,32} and
process_ptload_program_headers_elf{64,32} in order to indicate that the
offset includes the holes towards the page boundary.

As a result, both set_vmcore_list_offsets_elf{64,32} have the same
definition.  Merge them as set_vmcore_list_offsets.
