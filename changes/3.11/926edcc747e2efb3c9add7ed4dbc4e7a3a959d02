ARM: LPAE: use signed arithmetic for mask definitions

This patch applies to PAGE_MASK, PMD_MASK, and PGDIR_MASK, where forcing
unsigned long math truncates the mask at the 32-bits.  This clearly does bad
things on PAE systems.

This patch fixes this problem by defining these masks as signed quantities.
We then rely on sign extension to do the right thing.
