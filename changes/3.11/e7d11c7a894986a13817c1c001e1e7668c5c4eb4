KVM: MMU: zap pages in batch

Zap at lease 10 pages before releasing mmu-lock to reduce the overload
caused by requiring lock

After the patch, kvm_zap_obsolete_pages can forward progress anyway,
so update the comments

[ It improves the case 0.6% ~ 1% that do kernel building meanwhile read
  PCI ROM. ]

Note: i am not sure that "10" is the best speculative value, i just
guessed that '10' can make vcpu do not spend long time on
kvm_zap_obsolete_pages and do not cause mmu-lock too hungry.
