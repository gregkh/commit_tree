zram: avoid invalid memory access in zram_exit()

Memory for zram->disk object may have already been freed after returning
from destroy_device(zram), then it's unsafe for zram_reset_device(zram)
to access zram->disk again.

We can't solve this bug by flipping the order of destroy_device(zram)
and zram_reset_device(zram), that will cause deadlock issues to the
zram sysfs handler.

So fix it by holding an extra reference to zram->disk before calling
destroy_device(zram).
