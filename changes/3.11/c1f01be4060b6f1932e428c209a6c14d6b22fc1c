usb: musb: fix resource passed from glue layer to musb

some MUSB incarnations, such as those governed by
omap2430.c and tusb6010.c, have three resources, not
two.

Fix the bug created by commit 09fc7d2 (usb: musb:
fix incorrect usage of resource pointer) where only
two of the three resources would be passed to musb_core.c

[ balbi@ti.com : add tusb6010.c to original patch ]
