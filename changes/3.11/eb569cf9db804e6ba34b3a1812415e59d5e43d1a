[media] soc-camera: add host clock callbacks to start and stop the master clock

Currently soc-camera uses a single camera host callback to activate the
interface master clock and to configure the interface for a specific
client. However, during probing we might not have the information about
a client, we just need to activate the clock. Add new camera host driver
callbacks to only start and stop the clock without and client-specific
configuration.
