powerpc/vfio: Enable on PowerNV platform

This initializes IOMMU groups based on the IOMMU configuration
discovered during the PCI scan on POWERNV (POWER non virtualized)
platform.  The IOMMU groups are to be used later by the VFIO driver,
which is used for PCI pass through.

It also implements an API for mapping/unmapping pages for
guest PCI drivers and providing DMA window properties.
This API is going to be used later by QEMU-VFIO to handle
h_put_tce hypercalls from the KVM guest.

The iommu_put_tce_user_mode() does only a single page mapping
as an API for adding many mappings at once is going to be
added later.

Although this driver has been tested only on the POWERNV
platform, it should work on any platform which supports
TCE tables.  As h_put_tce hypercall is received by the host
kernel and processed by the QEMU (what involves calling
the host kernel again), performance is not the best -
circa 220MB/s on 10Gb ethernet network.

To enable VFIO on POWER, enable SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU config
option and configure VFIO as required.
