[SCSI] Fix race between starved list and device removal

scsi_run_queue() examines all SCSI devices that are present on
the starved list. Since scsi_run_queue() unlocks the SCSI host
lock a SCSI device can get removed after it has been removed
from the starved list and before its queue is run. Protect
against that race condition by holding a reference on the
queue while running it.
