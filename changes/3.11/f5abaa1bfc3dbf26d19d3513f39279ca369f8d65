tracing: Add DEFINE_EVENT_FN() macro

Each TRACE_EVENT() adds several helper functions. If two or more trace events
share the same structure and print format, they can also share most of these
helper functions and save a lot of space from duplicate code. This is why the
DECLARE_EVENT_CLASS() and DEFINE_EVENT() were created.

Some events require a trigger to be called at registering and unregistering of
the event and to do so they use TRACE_EVENT_FN().

If multiple events require a trigger, they currently have no choice but to use
TRACE_EVENT_FN() as there's no DEFINE_EVENT_FN() available. This unfortunately
causes a lot of wasted duplicate code created.

By adding a DEFINE_EVENT_FN(), these events can still use a
DECLARE_EVENT_CLASS() and then define their own triggers.
