ARM: fix nommu builds with 48be69a02 (ARM: move signal handlers into a vdso-like page)

Olof reports that noMMU builds error out with:

arch/arm/kernel/signal.c: In function 'setup_return':
arch/arm/kernel/signal.c:413:25: error: 'mm_context_t' has no member named 'sigpage'

This shows one of the evilnesses of IS_ENABLED().  Get rid of it here
and replace it with #ifdef's - and as no noMMU platform can make use
of sigpage, depend on CONIFG_MMU not CONFIG_ARM_MPU.
