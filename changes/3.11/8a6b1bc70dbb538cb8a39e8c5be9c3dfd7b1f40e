powerpc/eeh: EEH core to handle special event

On PowerNV platform, the EEH event caused by interrupt won't have
binding PE. The patch enables EEH core to handle the special event.
To avoid the current logic we have, The eeh_handle_event() is renamed
to eeh_handle_normal_event(), and the eeh_handle_special_event() is
introduced. The function eeh_handle_event() dispatches to above two
functions according to the input parameter. Besides, new backend
"next_error" added to eeh_ops and it's expected to have following
return values:

        4 - Dead IOC           3 - Dead PHB
        2 - Fenced PHB         1 - Frozen PE
        0 - No error found
