[SCSI] libsas: implement > 16 byte CDB support

Remove the arbitrary expectation in libsas that all SCSI commands are 16 bytes
or less.  Instead do all copies via cmd->cmd_len (and use a pointer to this in
the libsas task instead of a copy).  Note that this still doesn't enable > 16
byte CDB support in the underlying drivers because their internal format has
to be fixed and the wire format of > 16 byte CDBs according to the SAS spec is
different.  the libsas drivers (isci, aic94xx, mvsas and pm8xxx are all
updated for this change.
