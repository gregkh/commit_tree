ARM: tegra: add an assembly marco to check Tegra SoC ID

There are some Tegra SoC ID checking code around the low level assembly
code. Adding a marco to replace them. For the single image to support all
the Tegra series, we may also need the marco in other common code. So we
make it become a marco for the usage.
