net: tg3: fix NULL pointer dereference in tg3_io_error_detected and tg3_io_slot_reset

Commit d8af4dfd8 ("net/tg3: Fix kernel crash") introduced a possible
NULL pointer dereference in tg3 driver when !netdev || !netif_running(netdev)
condition is met and netdev is NULL. Then, the jump to the 'done' label
calls dev_close() with a netdevice that is NULL. Therefore, only call
dev_close() when we have a netdevice, but one that is not running.

[ Add the same checks in tg3_io_slot_reset() per Gavin Shan - by Nithin
Nayak Sujir ]
