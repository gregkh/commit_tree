powerpc/eeh: Move common part to kernel directory

The patch moves the common part of EEH core into arch/powerpc/kernel
directory so that we needn't PPC_PSERIES while compiling POWERNV
platform:

        * Move the EEH common part into arch/powerpc/kernel
        * Move the functions for PCI hotplug from pSeries platform to
          arch/powerpc/kernel/pci-hotplug.c
        * Move CONFIG_EEH from arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/Kconfig to
          arch/powerpc/platforms/Kconfig
        * Adjust makefile accordingly
