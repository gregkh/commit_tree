memcg: clean up memcg->nodeinfo

Remove struct mem_cgroup_lru_info and fold its single member, the
variably sized nodeinfo[0], directly into struct mem_cgroup.  This
should make it more obvious why it has to be the last member there.

Also move the comment that's above that special last member below it, so
it is more visible to somebody that considers appending to the struct
mem_cgroup.
