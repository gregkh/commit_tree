Btrfs: fix memory patcher through fs_info->qgroup_ulist

Commit 5b7c665e introduced fs_info->qgroup_ulist, that is allocated during
btrfs_read_qgroup_config and meant to be used later by the qgroup accounting
code. However, it is always freed before btrfs_read_qgroup_config returns,
becuase the commit mentioned above adds a check for (ret), where a check
for (ret < 0) would have been the right choice. This commit fixes the check.
