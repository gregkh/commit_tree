KVM: x86 emulator: decode extended accumulator explicity

Single-operand MUL and DIV access an extended accumulator: AX for byte
instructions, and DX:AX, EDX:EAX, or RDX:RAX for larger-sized instructions.
Add support for fetching the extended accumulator.

In order not to change things too much, RDX is loaded into Src2, which is
already loaded by fastop().  This avoids increasing register pressure on
i386.

Gleb: disable src writeback for ByteOp div/mul.
