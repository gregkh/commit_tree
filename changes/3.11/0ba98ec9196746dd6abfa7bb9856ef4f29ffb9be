ACPI / APEI: Force fatal AER severity when component has been reset

The CPER error record has a reset bit that indicates that the platform
has reset the component. The reset bit can be set for any severity
error including recoverable.  From the AER code path's perspective,
any error is fatal if the component has been reset.  This patch
upgrades the severity of the AER recovery to AER_FATAL whenever the
CPER error record indicates that the component has been reset.
