ARM: shmobile: Marzen: move USB EHCI, OHCI, and PHY devices to R8A7779 code

USB EHCI, OHCI, and common PHY are the SoC devices but are wrongly defined and
registered in the Marzen board file.  Move the data and code to their proper
place in setup-r8a7779.c; while at it, we have to rename r8a7779_late_devices[]
to r8a7779_standard_devices[] -- this seems legitimate since they are registered
from r8a7779_add_standard_devices() anyway.

Note that I'm deliberately changing the USB PHY platform device's 'id' field
from (previously just omitted) 0 to -1 as the device is a single of its kind.

Note also that the board and SoC code have to be in one patch to keep the code
bisectable...

The patch has been tested on the Marzen board.
