On muxed systems, the other vgaswitcheroo client may depend on i915 to
handle the backlight. We began switching off the backlight since

    drm/i915: disable all crtcs at suspend time

breaking backlight on discreet graphics in (some) muxed systems.

Keep the backlight on when the state is changed through vgaswitcheroo.

Note: The alternative would be to add a quirk table to achieve the same
based on system identifiers, but AFAICS it would asymptotically approach
effectively the same as this patch as more IDs are added, but with the
maintenance burden of the quirk table.
