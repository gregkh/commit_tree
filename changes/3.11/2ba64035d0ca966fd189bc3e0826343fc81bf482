tracing: Add comment to describe special break case in probe_remove_event_call()

The "break" used in the do_for_each_event_file() is used as an optimization
as the loop is really a double loop. The loop searches all event files
for each trace_array. There's only one matching event file per trace_array
and after we find the event file for the trace_array, the break is used
to jump to the next trace_array and start the search there.

As this is not a standard way of using "break" in C code, it requires
a comment right before the break to let people know what is going on.
