powerpc/math-emu: Allow math-emu to be used for HW FPU

(Including 64-bit ones)

This allow SW emulation by the kernel of optional instructions
such as fsqrt which aren't implemented on some processors, and
thus fixes some Fedora 19 issues such as Anaconda since the
compiler is set to generate those by default on 64-bit.
