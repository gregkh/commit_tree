ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: Clean up the data file

- The IO resource information like dma request lines, irq number and
  ocp address space can be populated via dt blob. So such data is stripped
  from OMAP4 SOC hwmod data file.

- The devices which are still missing the device tree bindings,
  address space entries are not removed yet. When such devices add
  the dt bindings, respective address space data can be deleted.

- Also other unnecessary hwmods like firewalls are removed as a part of this.
  Since emif was getting registered only because of this firewalls links,
  the mpu->emif direct link is added now.

The above update, results in reduction of about ~1650 lines of code.
