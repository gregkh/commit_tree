[SCSI] libiscsi: Added new boot entries in the session sysfs

This is the kernel part of the modification to extract the net params
from the ibft sysfs to the iface struct used for the connection
request upon sync_session in the open-iscsi util.

Three new session sysfs params are defined:
boot_root - holds the name of the /sys/firmware/ibft or iscsi_rootN
boot_nic  - holds the ethernetN name
boot_target - holds the targetN name
