cgroup: clean up the cftype array for the base cgroup files

* Rename it from files[] (really?) to cgroup_base_files[].

* Drop CGROUP_FILE_GENERIC_PREFIX which was defined as "cgroup." and
  used inconsistently.  Just use "cgroup." directly.

* Collect insane files at the end.  Note that only the insane ones are
  missing "cgroup." prefix.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
