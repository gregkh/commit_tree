vmcore: calculate vmcore file size from buffer size and total size of vmcore objects

The previous patches newly added holes before each chunk of memory and
the holes need to be count in vmcore file size.  There are two ways to
count file size in such a way:

1) suppose m is a poitner to the last vmcore object in vmcore_list.
   Then file size is (m->offset + m->size), or

2) calculate sum of size of buffers for ELF header, program headers,
   ELF note segments and objects in vmcore_list.

Although 1) is more direct and simpler than 2), 2) seems better in that
it reflects internal object structure of /proc/vmcore.  Thus, this patch
changes get_vmcore_size_elf{64, 32} so that it calculates size in the
way of 2).

As a result, both get_vmcore_size_elf{64, 32} have the same definition.
Merge them as get_vmcore_size.
