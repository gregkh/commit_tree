iwlwifi: pcie: fix race in queue unmapping

When a queue is disabled, it frees all its entries. Later,
the op_mode might still get notifications from the firmware
that triggers to free entries in the tx queue. The transport
should be prepared for these races and know to ignore
reclaim calls on queues that have been disabled and whose
entries have been freed.
