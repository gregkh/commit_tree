xhci: fix null pointer dereference on ring_doorbell_for_active_rings

in some cases where device is attched to xhci port and do not responding,
for example ath9k_htc with stalled firmware, kernel will
crash on ring_doorbell_for_active_rings.
This patch check if pointer exist before it is used.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.35, that
contain the commit e9df17eb1408cfafa3d1844bfc7f22c7237b31b8 "USB: xhci:
Correct assumptions about number of rings per endpoint"
