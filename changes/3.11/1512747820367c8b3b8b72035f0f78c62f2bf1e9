macvlan: validate flags

commit df8ef8f3aaa6692970a436204c4429210addb23a
    macvlan: add FDB bridge ops and macvlan flags
added a flags field to macvlan, which can be
controlled from userspace.
The idea is to make the interface future-proof
so we can add flags and not new fields.

However, flags value isn't validated, as a result,
userspace can't detect which flags are supported.
