mm: vmscan: do not allow kswapd to scan at maximum priority

Page reclaim at priority 0 will scan the entire LRU as priority 0 is
considered to be a near OOM condition.  Kswapd can reach priority 0
quite easily if it is encountering a large number of pages it cannot
reclaim such as pages under writeback.  When this happens, kswapd
reclaims very aggressively even though there may be no real risk of
allocation failure or OOM.

This patch prevents kswapd reaching priority 0 and trying to reclaim the
world.  Direct reclaimers will still reach priority 0 in the event of an
OOM situation.
