NFC: Remove the static supported_se field

Supported secure elements are typically found during a discovery process
initiated when the NFC controller is up and running. For a given NFC
chipset there can be many configurations (embedded SE or not, with or
without a SIM card wired to the NFC controller SWP interface, etc...) and
thus driver code will never know before hand which SEs are available.
So we remove this field, it will be replaced by a real SE discovery
mechanism.
