tracing: Update documentation on tracepoint glob matching

b0f1a59a "tracing/filters: Use a different op for glob match" added
glob matching to tracepoint filter strings. It uses the ftrace function
tracing glob matching facility that allows for the wild card character (*)
to be used at the start and/or end of the matching string.

But the documentation still states that the filtering only allows for
exact string matches.
