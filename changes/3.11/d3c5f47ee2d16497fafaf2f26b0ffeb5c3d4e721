net: Restore unintentional reverts.

This restores commits:

c573972c111eb4c6b3f3250ad71e7c75cc799833
1a5904342c7380ceddd61c0b37544d752d0b1433
da2e2c214953f37c2a6be20226537ca5a329724c

which initially accidently went into 'net', were
reverted there, and then properly placed into 'net-next'.
But the next net --> net-next merge accidently wiped them
out again.
