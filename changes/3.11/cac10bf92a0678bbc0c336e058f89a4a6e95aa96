staging: comedi: pcmda12: cleanup pcmda12_ao_insn_read()

Remove the boilerplate comment from the 'skel' driver.

To initiate the simultaneaous transfer, only one analog output
register needs to be read. Move the read out of the for() loop.

(*insn_read) functions should return an errno or the number of
samples actually read. Change the final return to insn->n to
make this clear.
