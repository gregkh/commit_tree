pci: PCIe driver for Marvell Armada 370/XP systems

This driver implements the support for the PCIe interfaces on the
Marvell Armada 370/XP ARM SoCs. In the future, it might be extended to
cover earlier families of Marvell SoCs, such as Dove, Orion and
Kirkwood.

The driver implements the hw_pci operations needed by the core ARM PCI
code to setup PCI devices and get their corresponding IRQs, and the
pci_ops operations that are used by the PCI core to read/write the
configuration space of PCI devices.

Since the PCIe interfaces of Marvell SoCs are completely separate and
not linked together in a bus, this driver sets up an emulated PCI host
bridge, with one PCI-to-PCI bridge as child for each hardware PCIe
interface.

In addition, this driver enumerates the different PCIe slots, and for
those having a device plugged in, it sets up the necessary address
decoding windows, using the mvebu-mbus driver.
