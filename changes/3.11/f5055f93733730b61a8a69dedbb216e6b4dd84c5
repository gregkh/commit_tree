ASoC: wm8962: Enable start-up and normal bias after reset in runtime resume

This part of bias settings are essential for WM8962 to power up. Without it
"wm8962 0-001a: DC servo timed out" might be prompted due to power-up failure
that happens to FLL if being used.

The driver's also bringing the bias down in the suspend path so it needs to be
powered up in the resume path for symmetry.

According to dapm_pre_sequence_async(), DAPM would call pm_runtime_get_sync()
to let driver finish the bias settings in pm_runtime_resume() before the bias
level being set to STANDBY. So no need to worry about disordered settings for
VMID of WM8962.
