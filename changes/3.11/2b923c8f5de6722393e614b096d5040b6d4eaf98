perf/x86: Check branch sampling priv level in generic code

This patch moves commit 7cc23cd to the generic code:

 perf/x86/intel/lbr: Demand proper privileges for PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_KERNEL

The check is now implemented in generic code instead of x86 specific
code. That way we do not have to repeat the test in each arch
supporting branch sampling.
