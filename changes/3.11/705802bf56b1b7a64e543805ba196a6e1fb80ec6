rt2x00: remove data_queue_desc struct

If the queue_init callback is implemented
by a driver it gets used instead of the
data_queue_desc based initialization.

The queue_init callback is implemented for
each drivers now, so the old initialization
method is not used anymore. Remove the unused
data_queue_desc structure and all of the
related code.
