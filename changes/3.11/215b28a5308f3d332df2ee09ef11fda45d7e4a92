s390: Fix broken build

Fix this build error:

  In file included from fs/exec.c:61:0:
  arch/s390/include/asm/tlb.h:35:23: error: expected identifier or '(' before 'unsigned'
  arch/s390/include/asm/tlb.h:36:1: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union [enabled by default]
  arch/s390/include/asm/tlb.h: In function 'tlb_gather_mmu':
  arch/s390/include/asm/tlb.h:57:5: error: 'struct mmu_gather' has no member named 'end'

Broken due to commit 2b047252d0 ("Fix TLB gather virtual address range
invalidation corner cases").
