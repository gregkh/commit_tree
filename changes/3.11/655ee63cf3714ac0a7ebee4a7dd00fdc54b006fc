[SCSI] scsi constants: command, sense key + additional sense strings

It has been several years since the SCSI constants.c
file has been updated. The attached is against lk 3.10
and brings the command strings, sense keys and additional
sense code strings into sync with spc4r36g.pdf.

Certain SCSI command names that previously only took the
opcode (i.e. byte 0 of the cdb) into account, have been
split into several command names using the associated
service action field to differentiate. For example,
persistent reservations that previously had 2 commands
(i.e. "in" and "out") have been expanded to 12 commands
(e.g. "Persistent reserve in, read reservation").

Sync SCSI command names, sense key strings and additional
sense code strings with SPC-4 draft revision 36g
