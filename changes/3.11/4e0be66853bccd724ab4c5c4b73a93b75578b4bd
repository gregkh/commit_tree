staging: rtl8192u: fix comments in r8192U.h

This patch fixes the comments in r8192U.h by:

1) replacing '// ... ' comments with '/* ... */' comments
2) removing from the comments the date and the developer's name
3) removing unnecessary comments when variables naming is
   descriptive enough

Also, it fixes some typos found in the comments and arranges
the comments placement and content aiming to improve code
readability and to limit line length below 80 chars, without
loosing the comment's substance.
