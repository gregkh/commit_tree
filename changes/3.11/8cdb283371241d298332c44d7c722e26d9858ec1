powerpc/eeh: Trace PCI bus from PE

There're several types of PEs can be supported for now: PHB, Bus
and Device dependent PE. For PCI bus dependent PE, tracing the
corresponding PCI bus from PE (struct eeh_pe) would make the code
more efficient. The patch also enables the retrieval of PCI bus based
on the PCI bus dependent PE.
