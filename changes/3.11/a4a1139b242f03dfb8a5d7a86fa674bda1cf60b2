arc_emac: fix compile-time errors & warnings on PPC64

As reported by "kbuild test robot" there were some errors and warnings
on attempt to build kernel with "make ARCH=powerpc allmodconfig".

And this patch addresses both errors and warnings.
Below is a list of introduced changes:
1. Fix compile-time errors (misspellings in "dma_unmap_single") on PPC.
2. Use DMA address instead of "skb->data" as a pointer to data buffer.
This fixed warnings on pointer to int conversion on 64-bit systems.
3. Re-implemented initial allocation of Rx buffers in "arc_emac_open" in
the same way they're re-allocated during operation (receiving packets).
So once again DMA address could be used instead of "skb->data".
4. Explicitly use EMAC_BUFFER_SIZE for Rx buffers allocation.
