ahci: fix Null pointer dereference in achi_host_active()

commit b29900e6 (AHCI: Make distinct names for ports in /proc/interrupts)
introuded a regression, which resulted Null pointer dereference for achi
host with dummy ports. For ahci ports, when the port is dummy port, its
private_data will be NULL, as ata_dummy_port_ops doesn't support ->port_start.

changes in v2: use pp to check dummy ports, update comments
