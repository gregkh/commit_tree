ARM: EXYNOS: Fix low level debug support

Presently, using exynos_defconfig with CONFIG_DEBUG_LL and CONFIG_EARLY_PRIN
on, kernel is not booting, we are getting following:

[    0.000000] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[    0.000000] kernel BUG at mm/vmalloc.c:1134!
[    0.000000] Internal error: Oops - BUG: 0 [#1] PREEMPT SMP ARM

Its because exynos[4/5]_map_io() function ioremaps a single 512KB memory
size for all the four uart ports which envelopes the mapping created by
debug_ll_io_init(), called earlier in exynos_init_io().

This patch removes iodesc entries for UART controller for all Samsung SoC's,
since now the Samsung uart driver does a ioremap during probe and any needed
iomapping for earlyprintk will be handled by debug_ll_io_init().

Tested on smdk4412 and smdk5250.
