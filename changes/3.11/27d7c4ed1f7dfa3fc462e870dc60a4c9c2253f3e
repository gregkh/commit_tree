ext4: silence warning in ext4_writepages()

The loop in mpage_map_and_submit_extent() is guaranteed to always run
at least once since the caller of mpage_map_and_submit_extent() makes
sure map->m_len > 0. So make that explicit using do-while instead of
pure while which also silences the compiler warning about
uninitialized 'err' variable.
