[media] v4l2-device: check if already unregistered

It was possible to unregister an already unregistered v4l2_device struct.
Add a check whether that already happened and just return if that was
the case.
Also refuse to register a v4l2_device if both the dev and name fields are
empty. A warning was already produced in that case, but since the name field
is now used to detect whether or not the v4l2_device was already unregistered
this particular combination should be rejected.
