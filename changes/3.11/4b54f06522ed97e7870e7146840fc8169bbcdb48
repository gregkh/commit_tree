MIPS: remove alloc_pci_controller prototype

Commit 610019baddcb4c4c323c12cd44ca7f73d7145d6f ("[MIPS] Remove unused
function alloc_pci_controller.") removed the function, but left the
prototype in the header file.

Remove it as well so people don't get tempted to use it and wonder why
it doesn't work.
