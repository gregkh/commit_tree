Bluetooth: Fix duplicate call to l2cap_chan_ready()

In l2cap_le_conn_ready() after doing l2cap_chann_add() the LE channel is
part of the list which is subsequently iterated in l2cap_conn_ready() in
this loop each channel will get l2cap_chan_ready() called which would
result in trying to set the channel two times into BT_CONNECTED state.
Instead it makes sense to just add the channel but not call chan_ready
in l2cap_le_conn_ready, which is what this patch does.
