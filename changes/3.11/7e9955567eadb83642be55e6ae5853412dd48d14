spi: s3c64xx: added support for polling mode

The 64xx spi driver supports partial polling mode.
Only the last chunk of the transfer length is transferred
or recieved in polling mode.

Some SoC's that adopt this controller might not have have dma
interface. This patch adds support for complete polling mode
and gives flexibity for the user to select poll/dma mode.
