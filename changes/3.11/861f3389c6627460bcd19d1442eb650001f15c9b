drm/i915: add support for 5/6 data buffer partitioning on Haswell

Now we compute the results for both 1/2 and 5/6 partitioning and then
use hsw_find_best_result to choose which one to use.

With this patch, Haswell watermarks support should be in good shape.
The only improvement we're missing is the case where the primary plane
is disabled: we always assume it's enabled, so we take it into
consideration when calculating the watermarks.

v2: - Check the latency when finding the best result
