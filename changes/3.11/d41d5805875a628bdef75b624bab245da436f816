clk: Disable unused clocks after deferred probing is done

With deferred probing, late_initcall() is too soon to declare a clock as
unused. Wait for deferred probing to finish before declaring a clock as
unused. Since deferred probing is done in late_initcall(), do the unused
check to late_initcall_sync.
