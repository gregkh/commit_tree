pinctrl-tz1090-pdc: add TZ1090 PDC pinctrl driver

Add a pin control driver for the TZ1090's low power pins via the
powerdown controller SOC_GPIO_CONTROL registers.

These pins have individually controlled pull-up, and group controlled
schmitt, slew-rate, drive-strength, and power-on-start (pos).

The pdc_gpio0 and pdc_gpio1 pins can also be muxed onto the
ir_mod_stable_out and ir_mod_power_out functions respectively. If no
function is set they remain in GPIO mode. These muxes can be overridden
by requesting them as GPIOs.
