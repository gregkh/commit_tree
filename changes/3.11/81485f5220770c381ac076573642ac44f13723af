regmap: regcache: Fixup locking for custom lock callbacks

The parameter passed to the regmap lock/unlock callbacks needs to be
map->lock_arg, regcache passes just map. This works fine in the case that no
custom locking callbacks are used, since in this case map->lock_arg equals map,
but will break when custom locking callbacks are used. The issue was introduced
in commit 0d4529c5 ("regmap: make lock/unlock functions customizable") and is
fixed by this patch.
