staging: rtl8192u: rename dwRegRead and rtStatus in r819xU_phy.c

This patch renames the following variables:
'dwRegRead' into 'reg'
'rtStatus'  into 'status'

This is done primarily to reduce line length below 80 chars,
since the size and the usage of dwRegRead variable
can be deduced by its type and the function called
to assign it, so it can be replaced by simply 'reg'.
Also, rtStatus is not more informative than just status
in the given context.
