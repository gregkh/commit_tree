mwifiex: scan delay timer cleanup in unload path

Return from scan delay timer routine if surprise_removed flag
is true. Also, cancel the timer in unload path.

This fixes a crash when scan delay timer accesses structures
that have been freed already.

Tested with "iwlist mlan0 scan & sleep 1; rmmod mwifiex_sdio"
