writeback: Fix periodic writeback after fs mount

Code in blkdev.c moves a device inode to default_backing_dev_info when
the last reference to the device is put and moves the device inode back
to its bdi when the first reference is acquired. This includes moving to
wb.b_dirty list if the device inode is dirty. The code however doesn't
setup timer to wake corresponding flusher thread and while wb.b_dirty
list is non-empty __mark_inode_dirty() will not set it up either. Thus
periodic writeback is effectively disabled until a sync(2) call which can
lead to unexpected data loss in case of crash or power failure.

Fix the problem by setting up a timer for periodic writeback in case we
add the first dirty inode to wb.b_dirty list in bdev_inode_switch_bdi().
