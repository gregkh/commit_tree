staging: ti-soc-thermal: remove external heat while extrapolating hotspot

For boards that provide a PCB sensor close to SoC junction
temperature, it is possible to remove the cumulative heat
reported by the SoC temperature sensor.

This patch changes the extrapolation computation to consider
an external sensor in the extrapolation equations.
