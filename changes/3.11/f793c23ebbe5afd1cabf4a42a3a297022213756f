ARM: KVM: arch_timers: zero CNTVOFF upon return to host

To use the virtual counters from the host, we need to ensure that
CNTVOFF doesn't change unexpectedly. When we change to a guest, we
replace the host's CNTVOFF, but we don't restore it when returning to
the host.

As the host sets CNTVOFF to zero, and never changes it, we can simply
zero CNTVOFF when returning to the host. This patch adds said zeroing to
the return to host path.
