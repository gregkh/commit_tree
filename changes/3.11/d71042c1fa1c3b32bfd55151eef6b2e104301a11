[media] mx1-camera: move interface activation and deactivation to clock callbacks

When adding and removing a client, the mx1-camera driver only activates
and deactivates its camera interface respectively, which doesn't include
any client-specific actions. Move this functionality into .clock_start()
and .clock_stop() callbacks.
