macvtap: Convert to using rtnl lock

Macvtap uses a private lock to protect the relationship between
macvtap_queue and macvlan_dev.  The private lock is not needed
since the relationship is managed by user via open(), release(),
and dellink() calls.  dellink() already happens under rtnl, so
we can safely convert open() and release(), and use it in ioctl()
as well.
