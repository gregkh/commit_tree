USB: OHCI: add missing PCI PM callbacks to ohci-pci.c

Commit c1117afb8589 (USB: OHCI: make ohci-pci a separate driver)
neglected to preserve the entries for the pci_suspend and pci_resume
driver callbacks.  As a result, OHCI controllers don't work properly
during suspend and after hibernation.

This patch adds the missing callbacks to the driver.
