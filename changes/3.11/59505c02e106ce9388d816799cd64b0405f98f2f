ath9k: limit multicast buffer hardware queue depth

The CAB (Content after Beacon) queue is used for beacon-triggered
transmission of buffered multicast frames. If lots of multicast frames
were buffered and this queue fills up, it drowns out all regular
traffic. To limit the damage that buffered traffic can do, try to limit
the queued data to becaon_interval / 8.
