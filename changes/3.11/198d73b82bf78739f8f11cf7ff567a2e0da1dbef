tipc: delete code orphaned by new server infrastructure

Having completed the conversion of the topology server and
configuration server to use the new server infrastructure,
the following functions become unused, and can be deleted:

   - tipc_createport()
   - port_wakeup_sh()
   - port_dispatcher()
   - port_dispatcher_sigh()
   - tipc_send_buf_fast()
   - tipc_send_buf2port

Additionally, the following variables become orphaned,
and can be deleted:

   - tipc_msg_err_event
   - tipc_named_msg_err_event
   - tipc_conn_shutdown_event
   - tipc_msg_event
   - tipc_named_msg_event
   - tipc_conn_msg_event
   - tipc_continue_event
   - msg_queue_head
   - msg_queue_tail
   - queue_lock

Deletion is done here in a separate commit in order to allow
the actual conversion changes to be more easily viewed.
