staging: comedi: pcl730: add support for the PCM-3730 PC/104 board

The PCM-3730 PC/104 board has the same register i/o map as the PCL-730
ISA board. The only difference is the number of isolated digital input
and output channels.

Add support for the PCM-3770 board to the pcl730 driver and remove the
standalone pcm3730 driver.
