cpuset: record old_mems_allowed in struct cpuset

When we update a cpuset's mems_allowed and thus update tasks'
mems_allowed, it's required to pass the old mems_allowed and new
mems_allowed to cpuset_migrate_mm().

Currently we save old mems_allowed in a temp local variable before
changing cpuset->mems_allowed. This patch changes it by saving
old mems_allowed in cpuset->old_mems_allowed.

This currently won't change any behavior, but it will later allow
us to keep tasks in empty cpusets.

v3: restored "cpuset_attach_nodemask_to = cs->mems_allowed"
