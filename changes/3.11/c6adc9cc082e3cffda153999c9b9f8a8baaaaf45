Btrfs: merge pending IO for tree log write back

Before applying this patch, we flushed the log tree of the fs/file
tree firstly, and then flushed the log root tree. It is ineffective,
especially on the hard disk. This patch improved this problem by wrapping
the above two flushes by the same blk_plug.

By test, the performance of the sync write went up ~60%(2.9MB/s -> 4.6MB/s)
on my scsi disk whose disk buffer was enabled.

Test step:
 # mkfs.btrfs -f -m single <disk>
 # mount <disk> <mnt>
 # dd if=/dev/zero of=<mnt>/file0 bs=32K count=1024 oflag=sync
