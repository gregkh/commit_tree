MIPS: kvm: Kconfig: Drop HAVE_KVM dependency from VIRTUALIZATION

Virtualization does not always need KVM capabilities so drop the
dependency. The KVM symbol already depends on HAVE_KVM.

Fixes the following problem on a randconfig:
warning: (REMOTEPROC && RPMSG) selects VIRTUALIZATION which has unmet direct
dependencies (HAVE_KVM)
warning: (REMOTEPROC && RPMSG) selects VIRTUALIZATION which has unmet
direct dependencies (HAVE_KVM)
