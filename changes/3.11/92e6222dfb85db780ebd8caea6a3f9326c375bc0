ext4: remove i_mutex from ext4_file_sync()

After removal of ext4_flush_unwritten_io() call, ext4_file_sync()
doesn't need i_mutex anymore. Forcing of transaction commits doesn't
need i_mutex as there's nothing inode specific in that code apart from
grabbing transaction ids from the inode. So remove the lock.
