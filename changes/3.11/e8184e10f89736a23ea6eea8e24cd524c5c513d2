m68k/atari: ARAnyM - Fix NatFeat module support

As pointed out by Andreas Schwab, pointers passed to ARAnyM NatFeat calls
should be physical addresses, not virtual addresses.

Fortunately on Atari, physical and virtual kernel addresses are the same,
as long as normal kernel memory is concerned, so this usually worked fine
without conversion.

But for modules, pointers to literal strings are located in vmalloc()ed
memory. Depending on the version of ARAnyM, this causes the nf_get_id()
call to just fail, or worse, crash ARAnyM itself with e.g.

    Gotcha! Illegal memory access. Atari PC = $968c

This is a big issue for distro kernels, who want to have all drivers as
loadable modules in an initrd.

Add a wrapper for nf_get_id() that copies the literal to the stack to
work around this issue.
