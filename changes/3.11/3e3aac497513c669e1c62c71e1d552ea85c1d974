vlan: fix a race in egress prio management

egress_priority_map[] hash table updates are protected by rtnl,
and we never remove elements until device is dismantled.

We have to make sure that before inserting an new element in hash table,
all its fields are committed to memory or else another cpu could
find corrupt values and crash.
