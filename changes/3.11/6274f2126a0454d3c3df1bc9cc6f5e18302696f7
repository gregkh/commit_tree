drm/i915: Don't count semaphore waits towards a stuck ring

If we detect a ring is in a valid wait for another, just let it be.
Eventually it will either begin to progress again, or the entire system
will come grinding to a halt and then hangcheck will fire as soon as the
deadlock is detected.

    drm/i915: detect hang using per ring hangcheck_score

"If ring B is waiting on ring A via semaphore, and ring A is making
progress, albeit slowly - the hangcheck will fire. The check will
determine that A is moving, however ring B will appear hung because
the ACTHD doesn't move. I honestly can't say if that's actually a
realistic problem to hit it probably implies the timeout value is too
low."

v2: Make sure we don't even incur the KICK cost whilst waiting.
