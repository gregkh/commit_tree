ALSA: usb-audio: detect implicit feedback on Roland devices

All the Roland/Edirol/BOSS USB audio devices that need implicit feedback
show this unambiguously in their descriptors, so it might be a good idea
to let the driver detect this.

This should make playback work correctly (at least with Jack) with the
following devices:
- BOSS GT-100
- BOSS JS-8 Jam Station
- Edirol M-16DX
- Roland GAIA SH-01
