hw_breakpoint: Introduce "struct bp_cpuinfo"

This patch simply moves all per-cpu variables into the new
single per-cpu "struct bp_cpuinfo".

To me this looks more logical and clean, but this can also
simplify the further potential changes. In particular, I do not
think this memory should be per-cpu, it is never used "locally".
After this change it is trivial to turn it into, say,
bootmem[nr_cpu_ids].
