clk: wm831x: Fix update wrong register for enable/disable FLL

According to the datasheet, FLL Enable is controlled by
R16530 (4092h) FLL Control1
        BIT 0: FLL Enable
                0 = Disable
                1 = Enable

Thus the code should update WM831X_FLL_CONTROL_1 register rather than
WM831X_FLL_CONTROL_2 register.

Also fixes a trivial typo in dev_crit message.
