ARM: KVM: Don't handle PSCI calls via SMC

Currently, kvmtool unconditionally declares that HVC should be used
to call PSCI, so the function numbers in the DT tell the guest
nothing about the function ID namespace or calling convention for
SMC.

We already assume that the guest will examine and honour the DT,
since there is no way it could possibly guess the KVM-specific PSCI
function IDs otherwise.  So let's not encourage guests to violate
what's specified in the DT by using SMC to make the call.
