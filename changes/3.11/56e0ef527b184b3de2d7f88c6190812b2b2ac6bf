drivers/net: caif: fix wrong rtnl_is_locked() usage

rtnl_is_locked() doesn't check who holds this lock, it just tells that it's
locked right now. if caif::ldisc_close really can be called under rtrnl_lock
then it should release net device in other context because there is no way
to grab rtnl_lock without deadlock.

This patch adds work which releases these devices. Also this patch fixes calling
dev_close/unregister_netdevice without rtnl_lock from caif_ser_exit().
