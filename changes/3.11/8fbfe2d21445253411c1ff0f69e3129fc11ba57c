[SCSI] qla2xxx: Do not query FC statistics during chip reset.

During a chip reset, the mailbox call to get FC statistics from the ISP will
not work resulting in needless mailbox accesses and errors printing out:

qla2xxx [0000:05:00.0]-00af:11: Performing ISP error recovery - ha=ffff881fad044800.

To prevent this, check for a chip reset when an application queries for FC
stats and return immediately if a chip reset is occurring.
