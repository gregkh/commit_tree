Bluetooth: fix wrong use of PTR_ERR() in btusb

PTR_ERR() returns a signed long type value which is limited by IS_ERR(),
it must be a negative number whose range is [-MAX_ERRNO, 0).

The bug here returns negative numbers as error codes, then check it by
"if (ret < 0)", but -PTR_ERR() is actually positive. The wrong use here
leads to failure as below, even panic.
