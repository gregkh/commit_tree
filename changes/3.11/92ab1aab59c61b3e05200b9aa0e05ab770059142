regmap: Make regmap-mmio usable from atomic contexts

regmap-mmio uses a spinlock with spin_lock() and spin_unlock() for locking.
To be able to use the regmap API from different contexts (atomic vs non-atomic),
without the risk of race conditions, we need to use spin_lock_irqsave() and
spin_lock_irqrestore() instead. A new field, the spinlock_flags field, is added
to regmap struct to store the flags between regmap_{,un}lock_spinlock(). The
spinlock_flags field itself is also protected by the spinlock.

Thanks to Stephen Warren for the suggestion of this particular solution.
