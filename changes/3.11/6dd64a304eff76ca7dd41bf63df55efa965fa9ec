cw1200: Replace use of 'struct resource' with 'int' for GPIO fields.

The only advantage of 'struct resource' is that it lets us assign names
as part of the platform data.  Unfortunately since we are using platform
data, we are already limited to a single instance of each driver,
rendering this moot.

So, replace the struct resources with ints, resulting in cleaner code.

This was based on a suggestion from Arnd Bergmann.
