[SCSI] zfcp: remove access control tables interface

This patch removes an interface that was used to manage access control
tables within the HBA. The patch consequently removes the handling
for conditions related to those access control tables, too.

That initiator-based access control feature was only needed until the
introduction of NPIV and was withdrawn with z10 years ago.
It's time to cleanup the corresponding device driver code.
