mm/vmalloc.c: remove dead code in vb_alloc

Space in a vmap block that was once allocated is considered dirty and
not made available for allocation again before the whole block is
recycled.  The result is that free space within a vmap block is always
contiguous.

So if a vmap block has enough free space for allocation, the allocation
is impossible to fail.  Thus, the fragmented block purging was never
invoked from vb_alloc().  So remove this dead code.
