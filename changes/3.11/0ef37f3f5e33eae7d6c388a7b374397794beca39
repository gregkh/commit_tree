    drm/i915: move PCH pfit controls into pipe_config

In refactoring this, it was only applied to eDP, which is incorrect.  In
fact, if we ever use the panel fitter to deal with overscan on HDMI,
we'll need to extend it again, so just drop the conditional altogether.

v2: drop check for eDP since we can use the fitter in any config (Daniel)
