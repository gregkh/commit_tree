MIPS: KVM: Mark KVM_GUEST (T&E KVM) as BROKEN_ON_SMP

Make KVM_GUEST depend on BROKEN_ON_SMP so that it cannot be enabled with
SMP.

SMP kernels use ll/sc instructions for an atomic section in the tlb fill
handler, with a tlbp instruction contained in the middle. This cannot be
emulated with trap & emulate KVM because the tlbp instruction traps and
the eret to return to the guest code clears the LLbit which makes the sc
instruction always fail.
