f2fs: support xattr security labels

This patch adds the support of security labels for f2fs, which will be used
by Linus Security Models (LSMs).

Quote from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules:
"Linux Security Modules (LSM) is a framework that allows the Linux kernel to
support a variety of computer security models while avoiding favoritism toward
any single security implementation. The framework is licensed under the terms of
the GNU General Public License and is standard part of the Linux kernel since
Linux 2.6. AppArmor, SELinux, Smack and TOMOYO Linux are the currently accepted
modules in the official kernel.".
