ARM: SAMSUNG: Use local definitions of watchdog registers

This patch adds local definitions of required watchdog registers and
bitfields to the uncompress header, allowing to remove the dependency on
plat/regs-watchdog.h header and the ugly hack to replace virtual with
physical addresses.

In addition, it fixes reboot on decompression failure feature, due to
the mentioned ugly hack not working anymore (the macro being redefined
got renamed, without fixing this code).
