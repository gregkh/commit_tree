MIPS: Netlogic: wait for all hardware threads

Earlier we just waited for the first thread of the CPU to come online
before proceeding to wake up others. Update it to wait for all the CPUs
in the core. This will be useful when the boot-up is slow, like while
debugging or when running in a simulator.
