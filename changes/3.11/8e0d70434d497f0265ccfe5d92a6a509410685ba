ALSA: es1968: Add radio support for MediaForte M56VAP

Add support for TEA5757 tuner on MediaForte M56VAP sound+modem+radio card.
The GPIO connection type is automatically detected (like snd-fm801 driver).

Also add a safety subsystem vendor check to skip radio detection if vendor
differs from ESS (so we don't touch GPIOs on laptops).

Tested with SF64-PCE2 and M56VAP cards.
