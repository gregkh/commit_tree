drm/exynos: remove duplicated error routine and unnecessary assign

There were duplicated error handling routines during allocating
pages in lowlevel_buffer_allocate() and g2d_userptr_get_dma_addr().
Also unnecessary NULL assignments for variable used not any more
are removed from g2d_userptr_get_dma_addr() and
g2d_userptr_put_dma_addr().
