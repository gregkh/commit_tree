blkcg: fix error return path in blkg_create()

In blkg_create(), after lookup of parent fails, the control jumps to
error path with the error code encoded into @blkg.  The error path
doesn't use @blkg for the return value.  It returns ERR_PTR(ret).
Make lookup fail path set @ret instead of @blkg.

Note that the parent lookup is guaranteed to succeed at that point and
the condition check is purely for sanity and triggers WARN when fails.
As such, I don't think it's necessary to mark it for -stable.
