Revert "x86 get_unmapped_area(): use proper mmap base for bottom-up direction"

This reverts commit df54d6fa54275ce59660453e29d1228c2b45a826.

The commit isn't necessarily wrong, but because it recalculates the
random mmap_base every time, it seems to confuse user memory allocators
that expect contiguous mmap allocations even when the mmap address isn't
specified.

In particular, the MATLAB Java runtime seems to be unhappy. See

  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60774

So we'll want to apply the random offset only once, and Radu has a patch
for that.  Revert this older commit in order to apply the other one.
