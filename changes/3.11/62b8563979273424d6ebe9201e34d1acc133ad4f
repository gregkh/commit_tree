perf: Add sysfs entry to adjust multiplexing interval per PMU

This patch adds /sys/device/xxx/perf_event_mux_interval_ms to ajust
the multiplexing interval per PMU. The unit is milliseconds. Value has
to be >= 1.

In the 4th version, we renamed the sysfs file to be more consistent
with the other /proc/sys/kernel entries for perf_events.

In the 5th version, we handle the reprogramming of the hrtimer using
hrtimer_forward_now(). That way, we sync up to new timer value quickly
(suggested by Jiri Olsa).
