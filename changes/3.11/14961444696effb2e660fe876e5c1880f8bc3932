rcu: Shrink TINY_RCU by reworking CPU-stall ifdefs

TINY_RCU's reset_cpu_stall_ticks() and check_cpu_stalls() functions
are defined unconditionally, and are empty functions if CONFIG_RCU_TRACE
is disabled (which in turns disables detection of RCU CPU stalls).
This commit saves a few lines of source code by defining these functions
only if CONFIG_RCU_TRACE=y.
