blk-throttle: add throtl_service_queue->parent_sq

To prepare for hierarchy support, this patch adds
throtl_service_queue->service_sq which points to the arent
service_queue.  Currently, for all service_queues embedded in
throtl_grps, it points to throtl_data->service_queue.  As
throtl_data->service_queue doesn't have a parent its parent_sq is set
to NULL.

There are a number of functions which take both throtl_grp *tg and
throtl_service_queue *parent_sq.  With this patch, the parent
service_queue can be determined from @tg and the @parent_sq arguments
are removed.

This patch doesn't make any behavior differences.
