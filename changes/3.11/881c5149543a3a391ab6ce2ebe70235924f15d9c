These runtime tests are great, except that there are a lot of them,
and they are very rarely needed.  Give them their own menu so that
only the folks who need them will have to go looking for them.

Note that there are some other runtime tests that are not in here,
like for RCU or locking.  This menu should only be used for tests
that do not have a more appropriate home.
