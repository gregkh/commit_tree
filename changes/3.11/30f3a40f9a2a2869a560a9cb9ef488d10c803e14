net: remove last caller of skb_tail_offset() and itself

Similar to the following commits:

commit 00f97da17a0c8d656d0c9 (netpoll: fix position of network header)
commit 525cebedb32a87fa48584 (pktgen: Fix position of ip and udp header)

using skb_tail_offset() seems not correct since the offset
is based on head pointer.

With the last caller removed, skb_tail_offset() can be killed
finally.
