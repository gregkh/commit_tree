metag: smp: don't spin waiting for CPU to start

Use a completion to block until a secondary CPU has started up, like ARM
do, instead of a loop of udelays.

On Meta, SMP is really SMT, with each "CPU" being a different hardware
thread on the same Meta processor core, so as well as being more
efficient and latency friendly, using a completion prevents the bogomips
of the secondary CPU from being drastically skewed every time by the
execution of the tight in-cache udelay loop on the other CPU.
