mm/page_alloc.c: remove unlikely() from the current_order test

In __rmqueue_fallback(), current_order loops down from MAX_ORDER - 1 to
the order passed.  MAX_ORDER is typically 11 and pageblock_order is
typically 9 on x86.  Integer division truncates, so pageblock_order / 2
is 4.  For the first eight iterations, it's guaranteed that
current_order >= pageblock_order / 2 if it even gets that far!

So just remove the unlikely(), it's completely bogus.
