mmc: core: Push common suspend|resume code into each bus_ops

By moving code from the mmc_suspend|resume_host down into each
.suspend|resume bus_ops callback, we get a more flexible solution.

Some nice side effects are that we get a better understanding of each
bus_ops suspend|resume sequence and the common code don't have to take
care of specific corner cases, especially for the SDIO case.
