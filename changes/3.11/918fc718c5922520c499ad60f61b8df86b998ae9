mm: vmscan: do not scale writeback pages when deciding whether to set ZONE_WRITEBACK

After the patch "mm: vmscan: Flatten kswapd priority loop" was merged
the scanning priority of kswapd changed.

The priority now rises until it is scanning enough pages to meet the
high watermark.  shrink_inactive_list sets ZONE_WRITEBACK if a number of
pages were encountered under writeback but this value is scaled based on
the priority.  As kswapd frequently scans with a higher priority now it
is relatively easy to set ZONE_WRITEBACK.  This patch removes the
scaling and treates writeback pages similar to how it treats unqueued
dirty pages and congested pages.  The user-visible effect should be that
kswapd will writeback fewer pages from reclaim context.
