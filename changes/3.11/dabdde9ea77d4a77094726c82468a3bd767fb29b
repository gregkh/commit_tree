sh_eth: consolidate sh_eth_reset()

This driver has sh_eth_reset() function for each SoC and this function is almost
always the same, except for the several a bit different variations for Gigabit
Ethernet.  Consolidate every variation into a single function -- which allows
us to get  rid of some more #ifdef'fery.

[Sergei: moved the new sh_eth_reset() and sh_eth_is_gether() up to decrease the
patch size, fixed function call continuation lines' indentation, reworded the
changelog, reworded the subject, changing the prefix.]
