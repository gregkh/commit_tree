sched/autogroup: Fix race with task_groups list

In autogroup_create(), a tg is allocated and added to the task_groups
list. If CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED is set, this tg is then modified while on
the list, without locking. This can race with someone walking the list,
like __enable_runtime() during CPU unplug, and result in a use-after-free
bug.

To fix this, move sched_online_group(), which adds the tg to the list,
to the end of the autogroup_create() function after the modification.
