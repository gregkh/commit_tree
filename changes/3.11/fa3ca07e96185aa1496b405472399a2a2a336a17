cgroup: refactor hierarchy_id handling

We're planning to converting hierarchy_ida to an idr and use it to
look up hierarchy from its id.  As we want the mapping to happen
atomically with cgroupfs_root registration, this patch refactors
hierarchy_id init / exit so that ida operations happen inside
cgroup_[root_]mutex.

* s/init_root_id()/cgroup_init_root_id()/ and make it return 0 or
  -errno like a normal function.

* Move hierarchy_id initialization from cgroup_root_from_opts() into
  cgroup_mount() block where the root is confirmed to be used and
  being registered while holding both mutexes.

* Split cgroup_drop_id() into cgroup_exit_root_id() and
  cgroup_free_root(), so that ID release can happen before dropping
  the mutexes in cgroup_kill_sb().  The latter expects hierarchy_id to
  be exited before being invoked.
