metag: panic if cache aliasing possible

If the cache and page size configuration allows for cache aliasing to
occur we warn on boot, but the log messages are easy to miss and will
result is random crashes occuring in userland. Let's panic too in this
case so that the user immediately knows they need to fix the cache
configuration or configured page size.

Also fix the warning messages which display the cache and page sizes to
include newlines, and add the word "Potential" since an actual cache
alias hasn't been detected.
