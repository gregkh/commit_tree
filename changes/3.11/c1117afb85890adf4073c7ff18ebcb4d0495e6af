USB: OHCI: make ohci-pci a separate driver

This patch splits the PCI portion of ohci-hcd out into its
own separate driver module, called ohci-pci.

The major point of difficulty lies in ohci-pci's many vendor- and
device-specific workarounds.  Some of them have to be applied before
calling ohci_start() some after, which necessitates a fair amount of
code motion.  The other platform drivers require much smaller changes.

The complete sb800_prefetch() function moved to ohci-q.c,because its
only related to ohci-pci driver.

USB_OHCI_HCD_PCI symbol no longer dependence on STB03xxx, PPC_MPC52xx and
USB_OHCI_HCD_PPC_OF that's what removed.

V2:
  - few specific content of pci related code in ohci_pci_start function has been moved to ohci_pci_reset
    and rest of the generic code is written in ohci_start of ohci-hcd.c file.
V3:
 - ohci_restart() has been called in ohci_pci_reset() function for to reset the ohci pci.

V4:
 -sb800_prefetch() moved to ohci-q.c,because its only related to ohci-pci.
 -no longer _creating_ CONFIG_USB_OHCI_PCI,creating CONFIG_USB_OHCI_HCD_PCI.
 -overrides renamed with pci_override,its giving proper meaning.

V5:
 -sb800_prefetch() moved to pci-quirks.c,because its only related to pci.

V6:
 -sb800_prefetch() function has been moved to pci-quirks.c made as separate patch in 2/3.
 -Most of the generic ohci pci changes moved in 2/3 patch,now this is complete  ohci-pci separation patch.

V7:
 -Unrelated include file has been removed from ohci.h file.

V8:
 -USB_OHCI_HCD_PCI symbol does not dependence on STB03xxx, PPC_MPC52xx and USB_OHCI_HCD_PPC_OF.
