DMA: shdma: add DT support

This patch adds Device Tree support to the shdma driver. No special DT
properties are used, only standard DMA DT bindings are implemented. Since
shdma controllers reside on SoCs, their configuration is SoC-specific and
shall be passed to the driver from the SoC platform data, using the
auxdata procedure.
