arm64: extable: sort the exception table at build time

As is done for other architectures, sort the exception table at
build-time rather than during boot.

Since sortextable appears to be a standalone C program relying on the
host elf.h to provide EM_AARCH64, I've had to add a conditional check in
order to allow cross-compilation on machines that aren't running a
bleeding-edge libc-dev.
