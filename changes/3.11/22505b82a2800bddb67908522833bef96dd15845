drm/i915: avoid brightness overflow when doing scale

Some card's max brightness level is pretty large, e.g. on Acer Aspire
4732Z, the max level is 989910. If user space set a large enough level
then the current scale done in intel_panel_set_backlight will cause an
integer overflow and the scaled level will be mistakenly small, leaving
user with an almost black screen. This patch fixes this problem.
