mmc: core: Support aggressive power management for (e)MMC/SD

Aggressive power management is suitable when saving power is
essential. At request inactivity timeout, aka pm runtime
autosuspend timeout, the card will be suspended.

Once a new request arrives, the card will be re-initalized and
thus the first request will suffer from a latency. This latency
is card-specific, experiments has shown in general that SD-cards
has quite poor initialization time, around 300ms-1100ms. eMMC is
not surprisingly far better but still a couple of hundreds of ms
has been observed.

Except for the request latency, it is important to know that
suspending the card will also prevent the card from executing
internal house-keeping operations in idle mode. This could mean
degradation in performance.

To use this feature make sure the request inactivity timeout is
chosen carefully. This has not been done as a part of this patch.

Enable this feature by using host cap MMC_CAP_AGGRESSIVE_PM and
by setting CONFIG_MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME.
