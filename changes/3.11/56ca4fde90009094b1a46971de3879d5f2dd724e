powerpc/eeh: Refactor the output message

We needn't the the whole backtrace other than one-line message in
the error reporting interrupt handler. For errors triggered by
access PCI config space or MMIO, we replace "WARN(1, ...)" with
pr_err() and dump_stack(). The patch also adds more output messages
to indicate what EEH core is doing. Besides, some printk() are
replaced with pr_warning().
