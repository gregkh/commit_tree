tracing: Introduce remove_event_file_dir()

Preparation for the next patch. Extract the common code from
remove_event_from_tracers() and __trace_remove_event_dirs()
into the new helper, remove_event_file_dir().

The patch looks more complicated than it actually is, it also
moves remove_subsystem() up to avoid the forward declaration.
