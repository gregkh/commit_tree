USB: OHCI: prepare to make ohci-hcd a library module

This patch prepares ohci-hcd for being split up into a core
library and separate platform driver modules.  A generic
ohci_hc_driver structure is created, containing all the "standard"
values, and a new mechanism is added whereby a driver module can
specify a set of overrides to those values.  In addition the
ohci_restart(),ohci_suspend() and ohci_resume() routines need
to be EXPORTed for use by the drivers.

Added ohci_setip(() and ohci_start() routine for to start the generic
controller rather than each having its own idiosyncratic approach.
This allow to clean duplicated code in most of SOC driver

In V2:
 -ohci_hcd_init() ohci_run() and ohci_stop() are not made non-static.
 -Adds the ohci_setup() and ohci_start() routine.

In V3:
 -purpose of ohci_setup() and ohci_start() function description written in the patch
  description.
 -ohci_init() are not made non-static but now called beginning of the ohci_restart().
 -ohci_run() signature change reverted back.
 -unrelated changes removed.
 -duplicate comment line removed.
 -inline ohci_suspend() and ohci_resume() is not needed so removed from ohci.h file.

In V4:
 -ohci-init() EXPORTed because it is called by all bus glue modules.
 -ohci-setup() removed from 1/2 added into 2/2 patch.

In V5:
 -Again ohci_setup() is added and EXPORTed because to replace the ohci_init() from
  all bus glues.
 -ohci_init() is not made non-static function.

In V6:
  -ohci_init() call is removed from ohci_quirk_nec_worker(), because it is already called in ohci_restart().

In V8:
  -ohci_hcd_init() is called by ohci_setup() to make generic ohci initialization in all ohci drivers.
