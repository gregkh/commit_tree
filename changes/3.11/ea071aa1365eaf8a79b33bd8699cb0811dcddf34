9P: Fix fcall allocation for rdma

The current code assumes that when a request in the request array
does have a tc, it also has a rc.

This is normally true, but not always : when using RDMA, req->rc
will temporarily be set to NULL after the request has been sent.
That is usually OK though, as when the reply arrives, req->rc will be
reassigned to a sane value before the request is recycled.

But there is a catch : if the request is flushed, the reply will never
arrive, and req->rc will be NULL, but not req->tc.

This patch fixes p9_tag_alloc to take this into account.
