drm/i915: refactor VLV IOSF sideband accessors to use one helper

Both the intel_dpio_{read,write} and valleyview_{punit,nc}_{read,write}
use the IOSF sideband interface. They access the same registers and do
mostly the same stuff, but no shared code. There are even duplicate
register defines for the same registers. Both have locking, but the
former use dpio_lock and the latter rps.hw_lock. It's racy.

This patch refactors the sideband access to a single function that
expects dpio_lock to be held. The dpio_lock is only used for sideband
stuff, so it's a better match than rps.hw_lock for the purpose. The rps
stuff still needs rps.hw_lock, since it's used to protect more than just
the register access, so rps code will need to hold both locks.
