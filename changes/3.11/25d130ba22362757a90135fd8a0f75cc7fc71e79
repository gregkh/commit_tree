mm/writeback: don't check force_wait to handle bdi->work_list

After commit 839a8e8660b6 ("writeback: replace custom worker pool
implementation with unbound workqueue"), bdi_writeback_workfn runs off
bdi_writeback->dwork, on each execution, it processes bdi->work_list and
reschedules if there are more things to do instead of flush any work
that race with us existing.  It is unecessary to check force_wait in
wb_do_writeback since it is always 0 after the mentioned commit.  This
patch remove the force_wait in wb_do_writeback.
