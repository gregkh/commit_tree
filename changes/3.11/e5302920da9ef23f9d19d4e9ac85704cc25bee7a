perf: Fix interrupt handler timing harness

This patch fixes a serious bug in:

  14c63f17b1fd perf: Drop sample rate when sampling is too slow

There was an misunderstanding on the API of the do_div()
macro. It returns the remainder of the division and this
was not what the function expected leading to disabling the
interrupt latency watchdog.

This patch also remove a duplicate assignment in
perf_sample_event_took().
