vhost/scsi: Drop unnecessary wait_for_tasks=true usage with transport_generic_free_cmd

This patch changes vhost_scsi_free_cmd() to call transport_generic_free_cmd()
with wait_for_tasks=false in order to avoid the extra se_cmd->t_state_lock
access for the wait_for_tasks=true case.

This is unnecessary because vhost_scsi_free_cmd() is only ever called by
vhost_scsi_complete_cmd_work() after TCM completion handoff, and by
vhost_scsi_handle_vq() exception code before TCM submission handoff, so
there is never a case where se_cmd is still active from TCM's perspective
when transport_generic_free_cmd() is called.
