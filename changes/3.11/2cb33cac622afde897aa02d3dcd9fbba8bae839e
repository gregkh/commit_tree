libceph: Fix NULL pointer dereference in auth client code

A malicious monitor can craft an auth reply message that could cause a
NULL function pointer dereference in the client's kernel.

To prevent this, the auth_none protocol handler needs an empty
ceph_auth_client_ops->build_request() function.
