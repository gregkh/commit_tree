tracing: Change event_filter_read/write to verify i_private != NULL

event_filter_read/write() are racy, ftrace_event_call can be already
freed by trace_remove_event_call() callers.

1. Shift mutex_lock(event_mutex) from print/apply_event_filter to
   the callers.

2. Change the callers, event_filter_read() and event_filter_write()
   to read i_private under this mutex and abort if it is NULL.

This fixes nothing, but now we can change debugfs_remove("filter")
callers to nullify ->i_private and fix the the problem.
