Btrfs: fix backref walking when we hit a compressed extent

If you do btrfs inspect-internal logical-resolve on a compressed extent that has
been partly overwritten it won't find anything.  This is because we try and
match the extent offset we've searched for based on the extent offset in the
data extent entry.  However this doesn't work for compressed extents because the
offsets are for the uncompressed size, not the compressed size.  So instead only
do this check if we are not compressed, that way we can get an actual entry for
the physical offset rather than nothing for compressed.  Thanks,
