tracing: Fix disabling of soft disable

The comment on the soft disable 'disable' case of
__ftrace_event_enable_disable() states that the soft disable bit
should be cleared in that case, but currently only the soft mode bit
is actually cleared.

This essentially leaves the standard non-soft-enable enable/disable
paths as the only way to clear the soft disable flag, but the soft
disable bit should also be cleared when removing a trigger with '!'.

Also, the SOFT_DISABLED bit should never be set if SOFT_MODE is
cleared.

This fixes the above discrepancies.
