NFSv4.1 Fix gdia_maxcount calculation to fit in ca_maxresponsesize

The GETDEVICEINFO gdia_maxcount represents all of the data being returned
within the GETDEVICEINFO4resok structure and includes the XDR overhead.

The CREATE_SESSION ca_maxresponsesize is the maximum reply and includes the RPC
headers (including security flavor credentials and verifiers).

Split out the struct pnfs_device field maxcount which is the gdia_maxcount
from the pglen field which is the reply (the total) buffer length.
