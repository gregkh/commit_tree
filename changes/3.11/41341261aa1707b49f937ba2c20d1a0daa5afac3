usb: check usb_hub_to_struct_hub() return value

usb_hub_to_struct_hub() can return NULL in some unlikely cases.
Add checks where appropriate, or pass the hub pointer as an additional
argument if it's known to be valid.

The places it makes sense to check usb_hub_to_struct_hub()
are picked based on feedback from Alan Stern.
