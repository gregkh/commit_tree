ext4: improve writepage credit estimate for files with indirect blocks

ext4_ind_trans_blocks() wrongly used 'chunk' argument to decide whether
blocks mapped are logically contiguous. That is wrong since the argument
informs whether the blocks are physically contiguous. As the blocks
mapped are always logically contiguous and that's all
ext4_ind_trans_blocks() cares about, just remove the 'chunk' argument.
