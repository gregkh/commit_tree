[SCSI] lpfc: Don't force CONFIG_GENERIC_CSUM on

We want ppc64 to be able to select between optimised assembly
checksum routines in big endian and the generic lib/checksum.c
routines in little endian.

The lpfc driver is forcing CONFIG_GENERIC_CSUM on which means
we are unable to make the decision to enable it in the arch
Kconfig. If the option exists it is always forced on.

This got introduced in 3.10 via commit 6a7252fdb0c3 ([SCSI] lpfc:
fix up Kconfig dependencies). I spoke to Randy about it and
the original issue was with CRC_T10DIF not being defined.

As such, remove the select of CONFIG_GENERIC_CSUM.
