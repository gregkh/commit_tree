staging: octeon-usb: place opening braces of structs, enums on top

this fixes coding style problem, placing of the braces just right after the
struct name, not below the struct name.

this reduces the errors reported by checkpatch script from

total: 1496 errors, 2133 warnings, 3344 lines checked

to

total: 1488 errors, 2132 warnings, 3336 lines checked
