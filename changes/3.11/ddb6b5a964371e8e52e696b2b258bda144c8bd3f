ALSA: 6fire: fix DMA issues with URB transfer_buffer usage

Patch fixes 6fire not to use stack as URB transfer_buffer. URB buffers need to
be DMA-able, which stack is not. Furthermore, transfer_buffer should not be
allocated as part of larger device structure because DMA coherency issues and
patch fixes this issue too.
