tracing: Change tracing_buffers_fops to rely on tracing_get_cpu()

tracing_buffers_open() is racy, the memory inode->i_private points
to can be already freed.

Change debugfs_create_file("trace_pipe_raw", data) caller to pass
"data = tr", tracing_buffers_open() can use tracing_get_cpu().

Change debugfs_create_file("snapshot_raw_fops", data) caller too,
this file uses tracing_buffers_open/release.
