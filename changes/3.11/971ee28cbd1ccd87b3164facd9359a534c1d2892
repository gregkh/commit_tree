sched: Fix HRTICK

David reported that the HRTICK sched feature was borken; which was enough
motivation for me to finally fix it ;-)

We should not allow hrtimer code to do softirq wakeups while holding scheduler
locks. The hrtimer code only needs this when we accidentally try to program an
expired time. We don't much care about those anyway since we have the regular
tick to fall back to.
