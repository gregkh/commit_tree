irqdomain: Include hwirq number in /proc/interrupts

Add the hardware interrupt number to the output of /proc/interrupts.
It is often important to have access to the hardware interrupt number because
it identifies exactly how an interrupt signal is wired up to the interrupt
controller.  This is especially important when using irq_domains since irq
numbers get dynamically allocated in that case, and have no relation to the
actual hardware number.

Note: This output is currently conditional on whether or not the irq_domain
pointer is set; however hwirq could still be used without irq_domain.  It
may be worthwhile to always output the hwirq number regardless of the
domain pointer.
