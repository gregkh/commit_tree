USB: usbtmc: TMC request code segregated from usbtmc_read

These patches implement a modification of the USBTMC
protocol to allow operation with Rigol equipment. The TMC request portion of
the code in function usbtmc_read is segregated to a function
send_request_dev_dep_msg_in as implemented by tommie in
https://github.com/tommie/linux/blob/usbtmc-rigol/drivers/usb/class/usbtmc.c
allowing the reuse later.
