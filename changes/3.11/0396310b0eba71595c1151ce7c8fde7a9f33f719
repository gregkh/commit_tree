input: ti_am33x_tsc: Add DT support

This patch adds DT support to touch driver. It also provides a binding
document which is used by the MFD and IIO part of the device.
This patch also renames steps_to_configure to coordinate_readouts
because the original name misleads the purpose of the variable.
