drm/i915: fix up pch pll handling in ->mode_set

We ->mode_set is called we can't just blindly reuse an existing pll
since that might be shared with a different, still active pch output.

v2: Only update the pll settings when the pch pll is know to be
unused, otherwise we can wreak havoc with a running pipe. Which in the
case of DP will likely result in a black screen due to loss of link
lock.

v3: Tighten up the asserts a bit more, especially make sure that the
pch pll is still enabled when we try to disable it. This would have
caught the bug fixed in this patch.
