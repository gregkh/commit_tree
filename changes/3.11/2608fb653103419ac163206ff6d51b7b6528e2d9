drivers: hv: allocate synic structures before hv_synic_init()

We currently allocate synic structures in hv_sync_init(), but there's no way for
the driver to know about the allocation failure and it may continue to use the
uninitialized pointers. Solve this by introducing helpers for allocating and
freeing and doing the allocation before the on_each_cpu() call in
vmbus_bus_init().
