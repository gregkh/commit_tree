GFS2: Only do one directory search on create

Creation of a new inode requires a directory search in order to ensure
that we are not trying to create an inode with the same name as an
existing one. This was hidden away inside the create_ok() function.

In the case that there was an existing inode, and a lookup can be
substituted for a create (which is the case with regular files
when the O_EXCL flag is not in use) then we were doing a second
lookup in order to return the inode.

This patch merges these two lookups into one. This can be done by
passing a flag to gfs2_dir_search() to tell it to just return -EEXIST
in the cases where we don't actually want to look up the inode.
