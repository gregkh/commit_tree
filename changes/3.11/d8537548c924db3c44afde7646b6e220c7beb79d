drivers: avoid format strings in names passed to alloc_workqueue()

For the workqueue creation interfaces that do not expect format strings,
make sure they cannot accidently be parsed that way.  Additionally, clean
up calls made with a single parameter that would be handled as a format
string.  Many callers are passing potentially dynamic string content, so
use "%s" in those cases to avoid any potential accidents.
