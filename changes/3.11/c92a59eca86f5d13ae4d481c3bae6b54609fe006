ipv6: handle Redirect ICMP Message with no Redirected Header option

rfc 4861 says the Redirected Header option is optional, so
the kernel should not drop the Redirect Message that has no
Redirected Header option. In this patch, the function
ip6_redirect_no_header() is introduced to deal with that
condition.
