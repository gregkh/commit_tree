ASoC: ux500: Ensure consistent configuration between DAIs

Current implementation of mop500_ab8500 allows for inconsistent sample
rate and channel count configuration between the playback and recording
interfaces, through in the hardware the two MSP controllers share
common clock and frame sync signals.

This patch adds the necessary code to ensure that the two device are
configure consistently.  The check is added at machine driver level, as
how to lock DAI configuration depend of the actual hardware
implementation.
