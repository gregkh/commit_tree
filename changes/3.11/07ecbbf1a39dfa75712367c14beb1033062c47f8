staging: rtl8192u: replace *Value variables in r819xU_phy.c

This patch renames the variables OriginalValue, NewValue,
Original_Value, New_Value and retValue to reg, and
the variables bRegValue and dwRegValue to reg_u8 and
reg_u32, respectively. This is done primarily in
order to reduce the variable name length and consequently
line length.

Also, it replaces the pair of Original and New variables
with one variable.
