via-ircc: don't return zero if via_ircc_open() failed

If via_ircc_open() fails, data structures of the driver left uninitialized,
but probe (via_init_one()) returns zero. That can lead to null pointer dereference
in via_remove_one(), since it does not check drvdata for NULL.

The patch implements proper error code propagation.
