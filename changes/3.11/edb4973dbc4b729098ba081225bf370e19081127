staging/lustre/lprocfs: use stats counter index for *pos

In lprocfs_stats_seq_{start,next,show,stop}() encode the counter index
(rather than the counter address) into *pos. Doing so simplifies these
functions and fixes a bug in the case of per-CPU stats where no stats
would be displayed at all if no events had yet occurred on CPU 0.
