clk: exynos4: Fix clock aliases for cpufreq related clocks

cpufreq driver for EXYNOS4 based SoCs are not platform drivers, hence
we cannot currently pass the clock names through a device tree node.
Instead, we need to make them available through a global alias.

Clock alias modifications for EXYNOS4 specific clocks are as below.

Alias for clock 'arm_clk' is 'armclk'.
Alias for clock 'mout_apll' is 'mout_apll'.
Alias for clock 'mout_core' is 'moutcore'.

For EXYNOS4210, alias for clock 'sclk_mpll' is 'mout_mpll'.
For EXYNOS4412, alias for clock 'mout_mpll_user_c' is 'mout_mpll'.

Some of the clock aliases are newly defined and some are fixed up.

While at it, also modify the debug messages to print the clock
values appropriately.
