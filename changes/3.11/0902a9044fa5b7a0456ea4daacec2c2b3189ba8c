Driver core: Use generic offline/online for CPU offline/online

Rework the CPU hotplug code in drivers/base/cpu.c to use the
generic offline/online support introduced previously instead of
its own CPU-specific code.

For this purpose, modify cpu_subsys to provide offline and online
callbacks for CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU set and remove the code handling
the CPU-specific 'online' sysfs attribute.

This modification is not supposed to change the user-observable
behavior of the kernel (i.e. the 'online' attribute will be present
in exactly the same place in sysfs and should trigger exactly the
same actions as before).
