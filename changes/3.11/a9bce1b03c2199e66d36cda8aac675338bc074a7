mfd: input: iio: ti_am335x_adc: use one structure for ti_tscadc_dev

The mfd driver creates platform data for the child devices and it is the
ti_tscadc_dev struct. This struct is copied for the two devices.
The copy of the structure makes a common lock in this structure a little
less usefull. Therefore the platform data is not a pointer to the
structure and the same structure is used.
While doing the change I noticed that the suspend/resume code assumes
the wrong pointer for ti_tscadc_dev and this has been fixed as well.
