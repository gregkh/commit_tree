USB: ti_usb_3410_5052: fix dynamic-id matching

The driver failed to take the dynamic ids into account when determining
the device type and therefore all devices were detected as 2-port
devices when using the dynamic-id interface.

Match on the usb-serial-driver field instead of doing redundant id-table
searches.
