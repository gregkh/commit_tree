mm: hugetlb: Copy huge_pmd_share from x86 to mm.

Under x86, multiple puds can be made to reference the same bank of
huge pmds provided that they represent a full PUD_SIZE of shared
huge memory that is aligned to a PUD_SIZE boundary.

The code to share pmds does not require any architecture specific
knowledge other than the fact that pmds can be indexed, thus can
be beneficial to some other architectures.

This patch copies the huge pmd sharing (and unsharing) logic from
x86/ to mm/ and introduces a new config option to activate it:
CONFIG_ARCH_WANTS_HUGE_PMD_SHARE
