perf record: handle death by SIGTERM

Perf data files cannot be processed until the header is updated which is
done via an on_exit handler.

If perf is killed due to a SIGTERM it does not run the on_exit hooks
leaving the perf.data file in a random state which perf-report will
happily spin on trying to read.

As noted by Mike an easy reproducer is:

perf record -a -g & sleep 1; killall perf

Fix by catching SIGTERM like it does SIGINT.

Also need to remove the kill which was added via commit f7b7c26e.
