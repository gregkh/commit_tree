Input: cyttsp4 - use 16bit address for I2C/SPI communication

In TSG4, register map is 512bytes long and to access all of it,
one bit from address byte is used (which bit to use differs for
I2C and SPI);

Since common code used for TSG3 and TSG4 for I2C, this parameter
wrongly used as u8. TSG3 does not access beyond 255 bytes
but TSG4 may.
