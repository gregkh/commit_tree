ext4: fix error handling in ext4_ext_truncate()

Previously ext4_ext_truncate() was ignoring potential error returns
from ext4_es_remove_extent() and ext4_ext_remove_space().  This can
lead to the on-diks extent tree and the extent status tree cache
getting out of sync, which is particuarlly bad, and can lead to file
system corruption and potential data loss.
