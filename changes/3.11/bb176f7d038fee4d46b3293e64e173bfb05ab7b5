cpufreq: Fix minor formatting issues

There were a few noticeable formatting issues in core cpufreq code.
This cleans them up to make code look better.  The changes include:
 - Whitespace cleanup.
 - Rearrangements of code.
 - Multiline comments fixes.
 - Formatting changes to fit 80 columns.

Copyright information in cpufreq.c is also updated to include my name
for 2013.
