x86: Sanity-check static_cpu_has usage

static_cpu_has may be used only after alternatives have run. Before that
it always returns false if constant folding with __builtin_constant_p()
doesn't happen. And you don't want that.

This patch is the result of me debugging an issue where I overzealously
put static_cpu_has in code which executed before alternatives have run
and had to spend some time with scratching head and cursing at the
monitor.

So add a jump to a warning which screams loudly when we use this
function too early. The alternatives patch that check away in
conjunction with patching the rest of the kernel image.

[ hpa: factored this into its own configuration option.  If we want to
  have an overarching option, it should be an option which selects
  other options, not as a group option in the source code. ]
