parisc: Fix interrupt routing for C8000 serial ports

We can't use dev->mod_index for selecting the interrupt routing entry,
because it's not an index into interrupt routing table. It will be even
wrong on a machine with 2 CPUs (4 cores). But all needed information is
contained in the PAT entries for the serial ports. mod[0] contains the
iosapic address and mod_info has some indications for the interrupt
input (at least it looks like it). This patch implements the searching
for the right iosapic and uses this interrupt input information.
