ipv4: use next hop exceptions also for input routes

Commit d2d68ba9 (ipv4: Cache input routes in fib_info nexthops)
assmued that "locally destined, and routed packets, never trigger
PMTU events or redirects that will be processed by us".

However, it seems that tunnel devices do trigger PMTU events in certain
cases. At least ip_gre, ip6_gre, sit, and ipip do use the inner flow's
skb_dst(skb)->ops->update_pmtu to propage mtu information from the
outer flows. These can cause the inner flow mtu to be decreased. If
next hop exceptions are not consulted for pmtu, IP fragmentation will
not be done properly for these routes.

It also seems that we really need to have the PMTU information always
for netfilter TCPMSS clamp-to-pmtu feature to work properly.

So for the time being, cache separate copies of input routes for
each next hop exception.
