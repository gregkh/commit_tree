sfc: Fix IRQ cleanup in case of a probe failure

The lifetime of an irq_cpu_rmap is odd: we have to allocate it before
installing IRQ handlers and free it before removing the IRQ handlers.
As a result of this asymmetry, it was omitted from some failure paths.

On another failure path, we could try to remove IRQ handlers we
had not yet installed.

Move the irq_cpu_rmap allocation and freeing alongside IRQ handler
installation and removal, in efx_nic_{init,fini}_interrupts().
Count the number of IRQ handlers successfully installed and only
remove those on the failure path.
