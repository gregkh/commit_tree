cope with potentially long ->d_dname() output for shmem/hugetlb

dynamic_dname() is both too much and too little for those - the
output may be well in excess of 64 bytes dynamic_dname() assumes
to be enough (thanks to ashmem feeding really long names to
shmem_file_setup()) and vsnprintf() is an overkill for those
guys.
