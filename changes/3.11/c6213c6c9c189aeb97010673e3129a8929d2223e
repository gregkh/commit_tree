MIPS: microMIPS: Fix improper definition of ISA exception bit.

The ISA exception bit selects whether exceptions are taken in classic
or microMIPS mode. This bit is Config3.ISAOnExc and was improperly
defined as bits 16 and 17 instead of just bit 16. A new function was
added so that platforms could set this bit when running a kernel
compiled with only microMIPS instructions.
