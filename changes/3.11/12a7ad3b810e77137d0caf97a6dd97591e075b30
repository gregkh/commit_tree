zram: avoid access beyond the zram device

Function valid_io_request() should verify the entire request are within
the zram device address range. Otherwise it may cause invalid memory
access when accessing/modifying zram->meta->table[index] because the
'index' is out of range. Then it may access non-exist memory, randomly
modify memory belong to other subsystems, which is hard to track down.
