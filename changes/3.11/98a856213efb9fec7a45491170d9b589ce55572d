staging: comedi: addi_apci_3xxx: absorb the private comedi_lrange tables

All the boards supported by this driver have the same private
analog input and output ranges.  Absorb the comedi_lrange tables
from hwdrv_apci3xxx.c directly into the driver. For aesthetic
reasons, rename the tables so they have namespace associated
with the driver.

Remove the 'pr_AiRangelist' and 'pr_AoRangelist' data from the
boardinfo and use the range tables directly when initializing
the subdevices.
