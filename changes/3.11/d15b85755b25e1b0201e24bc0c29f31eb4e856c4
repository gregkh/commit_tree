i2c: nomadik: allocate adapter number dynamically

The Nomadik I2C was using a local atomic counter to number
the I2C adapters. This does not work on configurations where
you also add, say a GPIO bit-banged adapter to the system.
They will start to conflict about being adapter 0.

There is no reason to use the numbered adapter function, and
the semantic effect on systems with only Nomadik I2C blocks
will be none - instead of increasing the number atomically
in the driver itself, it is done in the I2C core.
