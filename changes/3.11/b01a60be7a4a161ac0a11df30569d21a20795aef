ssb: fix alignment of struct bcma_device_id

The ARM OABI and EABI disagree on the alignment of structures
with small members, so module init tools may interpret the
ssb device table incorrectly, as shown  by this warning when
building the b43 device driver in an OABI kernel:

FATAL: drivers/net/wireless/b43/b43: sizeof(struct ssb_device_id)=6 is
not a modulo of the size of section __mod_ssb_device_table=88.

Forcing the default (EABI) alignment on the structure makes this
problem go away. Since the ssb_device_id may have the same problem,
better fix both structures.
