mm/sparse.c: put clear_hwpoisoned_pages within CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE

With CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE unset, there is a compile warning:

  mm/sparse.c:755: warning: `clear_hwpoisoned_pages' defined but not used

And Bisecting it ended up pointing to 4edd7ceff ("mm, hotplug: avoid
compiling memory hotremove functions when disabled").

This is because the commit above put sparse_remove_one_section() within
the protection of CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE but the only user of
clear_hwpoisoned_pages() is sparse_remove_one_section(), and it is not
within the protection of CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE.

So put clear_hwpoisoned_pages within CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE should fix
the warning.
