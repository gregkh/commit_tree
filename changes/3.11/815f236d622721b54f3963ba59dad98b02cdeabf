macvtap: add TUNSETQUEUE ioctl

This patch adds TUNSETQUEUE ioctl to let userspace can temporarily disable or
enable a queue of macvtap. This is used to be compatible at API layer of tuntap
to simplify the userspace to manage the queues. This is done through introducing
a linked list to track all taps while using vlan->taps array to only track
active taps.
