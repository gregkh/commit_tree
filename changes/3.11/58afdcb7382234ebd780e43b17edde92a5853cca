RDMA/cma: Update port reservation to support AF_IB

The AF_IB uses a 64-bit service id (SID), which the user can control
through the use of a mask.  The rdma_cm will assign values to the
unmasked portions of the SID based on the selected port space and port
number.

Because the IB spec divides the SID range into several regions, a
SID/mask combination may fall into one of the existing port space
ranges as defined by the RDMA CM IP Annex.  Map the AF_IB SID to the
correct RDMA port space.
