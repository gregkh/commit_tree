f2fs: fix i_blocks translation on various types of files

Basically an inode manages the number of allocated blocks with inode->i_blocks
which is represented in a unit of sectors, not file system blocks.
But, f2fs has used i_blocks in a unit of file system blocks, and f2fs_getattr
translates it to the number of sectors when fstat is called.

However, previously f2fs_file_inode_operations only has this, so this patch adds
it to all the types of inode_operations.
