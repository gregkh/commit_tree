staging: comedi: ni_labpc: cleanup true/false flags in boardinfo

The 'register_layout' in the boardinfo can be represented as
a true/false flag instead of an enum. Rename the variable to
'is_labpc1200' and change it to an unsigned 1-bit bit-field.

The 'has_ao' variable is also a true/false flag. Change it to
an unsigned 1-bit bit-field.

Reorder the boardinfo data so that the bit-field data is grouped
together.

For aesthetic reasons, and move the 'const' variables then
reorder the boardinfo declarations to match the definition.
