Btrfs: hold the tree mod lock in __tree_mod_log_rewind

We need to hold the tree mod log lock in __tree_mod_log_rewind since we walk
forward in the tree mod entries, otherwise we'll end up with random entries and
trip the BUG_ON() at the front of __tree_mod_log_rewind.  This fixes the panics
people were seeing when running

find /whatever -type f -exec btrfs fi defrag {} \;
