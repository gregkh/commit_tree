MIPS: uapi/asm/siginfo.h: Fix GCC 4.1.2 compilation

It wasn't until GCC 4.3 I believe that the __SIZEOF_*__ predefined macros
were added.  The change below switches <uapi/asm/siginfo.h> to the
_MIPS_SZLONG macro so that compilation with e.g. GCC 4.1.2 succeeds.
This is a user API header so I think this is even more important, for
older userland support.  The change adds an unsuccessful default too, to
catch any compiler configuration oddities.
