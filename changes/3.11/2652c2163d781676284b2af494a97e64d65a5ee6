TTY: snyclinkmp: calculating wrong addresses

This is a static checker fix and I don't have a way to test it.  But
from the context it looks like this is a typo where SCABUFSIZE was
intended instead of sizeof(SCABUFSIZE).  SCABUFSIZE is 1024 and
sizeof(int) is 4.  I would suspect this is a bad bug.
