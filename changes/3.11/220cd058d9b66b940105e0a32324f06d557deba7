dm: use __GFP_HIGHMEM in __vmalloc

Use __GFP_HIGHMEM in __vmalloc.

Pages allocated with __vmalloc can be allocated in high memory that is not
directly mapped to kernel space, so use __GFP_HIGHMEM just like vmalloc
does. This patch reduces memory pressure slightly because pages can be
allocated in the high zone.
