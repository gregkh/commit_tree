pinctrl: sh-pfc: fix SDHI0 VccQ regulator on sh73a0 with DT

The PFC pinctrl driver on sh73a0 is also regiatering a VccQ regulator for
SDHI0. However, its consumers list only included the platform-data based
SDHI device name. When booted with DT SDHI0 couldn't enable VccQ and
therefore was unusable. Fix this by adding a consumer with DT-based name.
