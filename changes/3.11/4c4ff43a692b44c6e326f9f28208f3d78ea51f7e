drm/i915: add "enable" argument to intel_update_sprite_watermarks

Because we want to call it from the "sprite disable" paths, since on
Haswell we need to update the sprite watermarks when we disable
sprites.

For now, all this patch does is to add the "enable" argument and call
intel_update_sprite_watermarks from inside ivb_disable_plane. This
shouldn't change how the code behaves because on
sandybridge_update_sprite_wm we just ignore the "!enable" case. The
patches that implement Haswell watermarks will make use of the changes
introduced by this patch.
