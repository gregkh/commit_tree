rcu: Drive quiescent-state-forcing delay from HZ

Systems with HZ=100 can have slow bootup times due to the default
three-jiffy delays between quiescent-state forcing attempts.  This
commit therefore auto-tunes the RCU_JIFFIES_TILL_FORCE_QS value based
on the value of HZ.  However, this would break very large systems that
require more time between quiescent-state forcing attempts.  This
commit therefore also ups the default delay by one jiffy for each
256 CPUs that might be on the system (based off of nr_cpu_ids at
runtime, -not- NR_CPUS at build time).

Updated to collapse #ifdefs for RCU_JIFFIES_TILL_FORCE_QS into a
step-function definition as suggested by Josh Triplett.
