percpu-refcount: implement percpu_ref_cancel_init()

Normally, percpu_ref_init() initializes and percpu_ref_kill()
initiates destruction which completes asynchronously.  The
asynchronous destruction can be problematic in init failure path where
the caller wants to destroy half-constructed object - distinguishing
half-constructed objects from the usual release method can be painful
for complex objects.

This patch implements percpu_ref_cancel_init() which synchronously
destroys the percpu_ref without invoking release.  To avoid
unintentional misuses, the function requires the ref to have finished
percpu_ref_init() but never used and triggers WARN otherwise.

v2: Explain the weird name and usage restriction in the function
    comment.
