thermal: consider emul_temperature while computing trend

In case emulated temperature is in use, using the trend
provided by driver layer can lead to bogus situation.
In this case, debugger user would set a temperature value,
but the trend would be from driver computation.

To avoid this situation, this patch changes the get_tz_trend()
to consider the emulated temperature whenever that is in use.
