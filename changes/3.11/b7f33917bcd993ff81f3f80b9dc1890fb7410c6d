ALSA: usb-audio: add quirks for Roland QUAD/OCTO-CAPTURE

The Roland Quad/Octo-Capture devices use some unknown vendor-specific
mechanism to switch sample rates (and to manage other controls).  To
prevent the driver from attempting to use any other than the default
44.1 kHz sample rate, use quirks to hide the other alternate settings.
