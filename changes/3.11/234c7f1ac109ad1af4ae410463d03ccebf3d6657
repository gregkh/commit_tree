metag: smp: enable irqs after set_cpu_online

In secondary_start_kernel() interrupts should be enabled with
local_irq_enable() after the cpu is marked as online with
set_cpu_online(). Otherwise it's possible for a timer interrupt to
trigger a softirq, which if the cpu is marked as offline may have it's
affinity altered.
