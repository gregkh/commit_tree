perf/x86/intel: Prevent some shift wrapping bugs in the Intel uncore driver

We're trying to use 64 bit masks but the shifts wrap so we can't use the
high 32 bits. I've fixed this by changing several types to unsigned
long long.

This is a static checker fix.  The one change which is clearly needed is
"mask = 0xff << (idx * 8);" where the author obviously intended to use
all 64 bits.  The other changes are mostly to silence my static checker.
