drm/i915: s/hotplug_irq_storm_detect/intel_hpd_irq_handler/

The combination of Paulo's fifo underrun detection code and Egbert's
hpd storm handling code unfortunately made the hpd storm handling code
racy.

To avoid duplicating tricky interrupt locking code over all platforms
start with a bit of refactoring. This patch is the very first step
since in the end the irq storm handling code will handle all hotplug
logic (and so also encapsulate the locking nicely).

v2: Rebase on top of the i965g/gm sdvo hpd fix.
