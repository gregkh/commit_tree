drivers: bus: add a new driver for WEIM

The WEIM(Wireless External Interface Module) works like a bus.
You can attach many different devices on it, such as NOR, onenand.

In the case of i.MX6q-sabreauto, the NOR is connected to WEIM.

This patch also adds the devicetree binding document.
The driver only works when the devicetree is enabled.
