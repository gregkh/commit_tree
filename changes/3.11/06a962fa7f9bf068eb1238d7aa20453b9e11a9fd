usb: misc: usb3503: Remove 100ms sleep on reset, conform to data sheet

The usb3503 driver sleeps a flat 100ms when resetting the chip, with a
comment about waiting for the reference clock. This seems to be a
board-specific detail that should not hold up boot across all platforms.
This patch reduces the sleep to the 4ms initialization delay that the
chip itself actually requires (as per its data sheet). If certain boards
require more time to set up the reference clock, they should change this
through local patches or add a proper, configurable synchronization
mechanism.
