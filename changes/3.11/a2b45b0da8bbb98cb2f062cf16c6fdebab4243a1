ARM: mpu: add header for MPU register layouts and region data

This commit adds definitions relevant to the ARM v7 PMSA compliant MPU.

The register layouts and region configuration data is made accessible to asm
as well as C-code so that it can be used in early bring-up of the MPU.

The mpu region information structs assume that the properties for the I/D side
are the same, though the implementation could be trivially extended for future
platforms where this is no-longer true.

The MPU_*_REGION defines are used for the basic, static MPU region setup.
