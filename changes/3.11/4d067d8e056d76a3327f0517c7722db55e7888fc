x86: Extend #DF debugging aid to 64-bit

It is sometimes very helpful to be able to pinpoint the location which
causes a double fault before it turns into a triple fault and the
machine reboots. We have this for 32-bit already so extend it to 64-bit.
On 64-bit we get the register snapshot at #DF time and not from the
first exception which actually causes the #DF. It should be close
enough, though.

[ hpa: and definitely better than nothing, which is what we have now. ]
