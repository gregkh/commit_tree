cpufreq / intel_pstate: Change to scale off of max P-state

Change to using max P-state instead of max turbo P-state.  This
change resolves two issues.

On a quiet system intel_pstate can fail to respond to a load change.

On CPU SKUs that have a limited number of P-states and no turbo range
intel_pstate fails to select the highest available P-state.

This change is suitable for stable v3.9+
