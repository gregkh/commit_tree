x86: Add NMI duration tracepoints

This patch has been invaluable in my adventures finding
issues in the perf NMI handler.  I'm as big a fan of
printk() as anybody is, but using printk() in NMIs is
deadly when they're happening frequently.

Even hacking in trace_printk() ended up eating enough
CPU to throw off some of the measurements I was making.
