drivers/base: Use attribute groups to create sysfs memory files

Update the sysfs memory code to create/delete files at the time of device
and subsystem registration.

The current code creates files in the root memory directory explicitly through
the use of init_* routines. The files for each memory block are created and
deleted explicitly using the mem_[create|delete]_simple_file macros.

This patch creates attribute groups for the memory root files and files in
each memory block directory so that they are created and deleted implicitly
at subsys and device register and unregister time.

This did necessitate moving the register_memory() updating it to set the
dev.groups field.
