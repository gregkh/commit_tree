staging/lustre/libcfs: cleanup linux-crypto

We don't need to implement crc32 and crc32pclmul on our own.
The crc32-pclmul support was merged into the 3.8 kernel in commit
78c37d1, no need to keep a local copy in Lustre anymore.
The crc32 implementation is identical to crypto-crc32. So drop
Lustre's private implementation and select kernel crypto in Kconfig.
