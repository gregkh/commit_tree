ARM: msm: Remove clock-7x30.h include file

This file is not used outside of the two users in the clock-7x30
array. Those two clocks are virtual "source" clocks that don't
really need to exist outside of the clock driver. Let's remove
them from the array, since they're not doing anything anyway, and
then remove the clock-7x30.h include file along with it.
