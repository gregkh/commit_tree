ip_tunnels: Use skb-len to PMTU check.

In path mtu check, ip header total length works for gre device
but not for gre-tap device.  Use skb len which is consistent
for all tunneling types.  This is old bug in gre.
This also fixes mtu calculation bug introduced by
commit c54419321455631079c7d (GRE: Refactor GRE tunneling code).
