qeth: Fix crash on initial MTU size change

When the initial MTU size is changed prior to any activity on the device
(e.g. by attaching a z/VM vNIC already configured in Linux to a guestLAN),
we call dev_kfree_skb_irq(NULL) which results in a kernel panic.
Adding a proper check for NULL pointers to address this issue.
