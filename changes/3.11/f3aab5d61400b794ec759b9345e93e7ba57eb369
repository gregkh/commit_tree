clk: Always notify whole subtree when reparenting

A clock's notifier count only reflects notifiers which are registered
directly for that clock. A reparent operation though affects the whole
subtree because of a potential rate change.
When issuing the pre rate change notifications only the notifier count
for the clock to be changed is considered and notifiers for subclocks
may never be called. Resulting in clocks in the subtree which have
registered notifiers, may receive a POST_- or ABORT_RATE_CHANGE
notification, without a PRE_RATE_CHANGE_NOTIFICATION.
Therefore always traverse the whole subtree when issueing pre rate
change notifications during a reparent operation.
