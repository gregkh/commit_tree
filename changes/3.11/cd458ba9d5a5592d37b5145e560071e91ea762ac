tracing: Do not (ab)use trace_seq in event_id_read()

event_id_read() has no reason to kmalloc "struct trace_seq"
(more than PAGE_SIZE!), it can use a small buffer instead.

Note: "if (*ppos) return 0" looks strange and even wrong,
simple_read_from_buffer() handles ppos != 0 case corrrectly.

And it seems that almost every user of trace_seq in this file
should be converted too. Unless you use seq_open(), trace_seq
buys nothing compared to the raw buffer, but it needs a bit
more memory and code.
