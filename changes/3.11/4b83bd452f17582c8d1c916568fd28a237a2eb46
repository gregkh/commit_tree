powerpc/eeh: Don't use pci_dev during BAR restore

While restoring BARs for one specific PCI device, the pci_dev
instance should have been released. So it's not reliable to use
the pci_dev instance on restoring BARs. However, we still need
some information (e.g. PCIe capability position, header type) from
the pci_dev instance. So we have to store those information to
EEH device in advance.
