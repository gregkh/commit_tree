net: Move MII out from under NET_CORE and hide it

All drivers that select MII also need to select NET_CORE because MII
depends on it.  This is a bit ridiculous because NET_CORE is just a
menu option that doesn't enable any code by itself.

There is also no need for it to be a visible option, since its users
all select it.
