rcu: Remove TINY_PREEMPT_RCU

TINY_PREEMPT_RCU adds significant code and complexity, but does not
offer commensurate benefits.  People currently using TINY_PREEMPT_RCU
can get much better memory footprint with TINY_RCU, or, if they really
need preemptible RCU, they can use TREE_PREEMPT_RCU with a relatively
minor degradation in memory footprint.  Please note that this move
has been widely publicized on LKML (https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/11/12/545)
and on LWN (http://lwn.net/Articles/541037/).

This commit therefore removes TINY_PREEMPT_RCU.
