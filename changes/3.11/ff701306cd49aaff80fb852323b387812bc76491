arm64: use common reboot infrastructure

Commit 7b6d864b48d9 (reboot: arm: change reboot_mode to use enum
reboot_mode) changed the way reboot is handled on arm, which has a
direct impact on arm64 as we share the reset driver on the VE platform.

The obvious fix is to move arm64 to use the same infrastructure.
