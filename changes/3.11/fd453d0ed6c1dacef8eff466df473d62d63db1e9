9P/RDMA: Use a semaphore to protect the RQ

The current code keeps track of the number of buffers posted in the RQ,
and will prevent it from overflowing. But it does so by simply dropping
post requests (And leaking memory in the process).
When this happens there will actually be too few buffers posted, and
soon the 9P server will complain about 'RNR retry counter exceeded'
errors.

Instead, use a semaphore, and block until the RQ is ready for another
buffer to be posted.
