staging: comedi: drivers: let core handle freeing s->private

Introduce a new subdevice runflags, SRF_FREE_SPRIV, and a new helper
function, comedi_set_spriv(), that the drivers can use to set the
comedi_subdevice private data pointer. The helper function will also
set SRF_FREE_SPRIV to allow the comedi core to automatically free the
subdevice private data during the cleanup_device() stage of the detach.

Currently s->private is only allocated by the 8255, addi_watchdog,
amplc_dio200_common, and ni_65xx drivers. All users of those drivers
can then have the comedi_spriv_free() calls removed and in many cases
the (*detach) can then simply be the appropriate comedi core provided
function.

The ni_65xx driver uses a helper function, ni_65xx_alloc_subdevice_private(),
to allocate the private data. Refactor the function to return an errno
or call comedi_set_spriv() instead of returning a pointer to the private
data and requiring the caller to handle it.
