ARC: [mm] Remove @write argument to do_page_fault()

This can be ascertained within do_page_fault() since it gets the full
ECR (Exception Cause Register).

Further, for both the callers of do_page_fault(): Prot-V / D-TLB-Miss,
the cause sub-fields in ECR are same for same type of access, making the
code much more simpler.

D-TLB-Miss [LD] 0x00_21_01_00
Prot-V     [LD] 0x00_23_01_00
                        ^^
D-TLB-Miss [ST] 0x00_21_02_00
Prot-V     [ST] 0x00_23_02_00
                        ^^
D-TLB-Miss [EX] 0x00_21_03_00
Prot-V     [EX] 0x00_23_03_00
                        ^^

This helps code consolidation, which is even better when moving code from
assembler to "C".
