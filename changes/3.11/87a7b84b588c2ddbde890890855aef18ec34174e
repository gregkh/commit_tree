bonding: add helper function bond_get_targets_ip(targets, ip)

Add function bond_get_targets_ip(targets, ip) which searches through
targets array of ips (arp_targets) and returns the position of first
match. If ip == 0, returns the first free slot. On failure to find the
ip or free slot, return -1.

Use it to verify if the arp we've received is valid and in sysfs.

v1->v2:
Fix "[2/6] bonding: add helper function bond_get_targets_ip(targets, ip)",
per Nikolay's advice, to verify if source ip != 0.0.0.0, otherwise we might
update 'null' arp_ip_targets' last_rx. Also, address style.
