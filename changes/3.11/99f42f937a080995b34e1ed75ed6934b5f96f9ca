Revert "crypto: twofish - add AVX2/x86_64 assembler implementation of twofish cipher"

This reverts commit cf1521a1a5e21fd1e79a458605c4282fbfbbeee2.

Instruction (vpgatherdd) that this implementation relied on turned out to be
slow performer on real hardware (i5-4570). The previous 8-way twofish/AVX
implementation is therefore faster and this implementation should be removed.

Converting this implementation to use the same method as in twofish/AVX for
table look-ups would give additional ~3% speed up vs twofish/AVX, but would
hardly be worth of the added code and binary size.
