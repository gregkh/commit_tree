MIPS: Only set cpu_has_mmips if SYS_SUPPORTS_MICROMIPS

As Jonas Gorske said in his patch:

   Disable cpu_has_mmips for everything but SEAD3 and MALTA. Most of
   these platforms are from before the micromips introduction, so they
   are very unlikely to implement it.

   Reduces an -Os compiled, uncompressed kernel image by 8KiB for
   BCM63XX.

This patch taks a different approach than his, we gate the runtime
test for microMIPS by the config symbol SYS_SUPPORTS_MICROMIPS.
