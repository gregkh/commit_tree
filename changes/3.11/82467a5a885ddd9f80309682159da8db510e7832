cpuidle: simplify multiple driver support

Commit bf4d1b5 (cpuidle: support multiple drivers) introduced support
for using multiple cpuidle drivers at the same time.  It added a
couple of new APIs to register the driver per CPU, but that led to
some unnecessary code complexity related to the kernel config options
deciding whether or not the multiple driver support is enabled.  The
code has to work as it did before when the multiple driver support is
not enabled and the multiple driver support has to be compatible with
the previously existing API.

Remove the new API, not used by any driver in the tree yet (but
needed for the HMP cpuidle drivers that will be submitted soon), and
add a new cpumask pointer to the cpuidle driver structure that will
point to the mask of CPUs handled by the given driver.  That will
allow the cpuidle_[un]register_driver() API to be used for the
multiple driver support along with the cpuidle_[un]register()
functions added recently.
