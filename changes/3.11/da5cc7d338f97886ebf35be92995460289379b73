zram: use atomic64_xxx() to replace zram_stat64_xxx()

Use atomic64_xxx() to replace open-coded zram_stat64_xxx().
Some architectures have native support of atomic64 operations,
so we can get rid of the spin_lock() in zram_stat64_xxx().
On the other hand, for platforms use generic version of atomic64
implement, it may cause an extra save/restore of the interrupt
flag.  So it's a tradeoff.
