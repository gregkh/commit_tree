ALSA: hdspm - Refactor SS/DS/QS clock multiplier into function

When the DoubleSpeed or QuadSpeed bit is set, the SingleSpeed frequency
has to be multiplied accordingly. Since this functionality will be
required at least twice, refactor it into a separate function.

The second reference to the newly introduced hdspm_rate_multiplier()
will be in a separate commit.
