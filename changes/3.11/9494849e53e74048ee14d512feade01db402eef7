ath9k_htc: fix data race between request_firmware_nowait() callback and suspend()

ath9k_hif_usb_probe() requests firmware asynchronically and
there is some initialization postponed till firmware is ready.
In particular, ath9k_hif_usb_firmware_cb() callback initializes
hif_dev->tx.tx_buf and hif_dev->tx.tx_pending lists.

At the same time, ath9k_hif_usb_suspend() iterates that lists through
ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_urbs(). If suspend happens before request_firmware_nowait()
callback is called, it can lead to oops.

Similar issue could be in ath9k_hif_usb_disconnect(), but it is prevented
using hif_dev->fw_done completion and HIF_USB_READY flag. The patch extends
this approach to suspend() as well.
