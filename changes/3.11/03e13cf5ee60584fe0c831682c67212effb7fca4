clockevents: Implement unbind functionality

Provide a sysfs interface to allow unbinding of clockevent
devices. The device is unbound if it is unused or if there is a
replacement device available. Unbinding of broadcast devices is not
supported as we don't want to foster that nonsense. If no replacement
device is available the unbind returns -EBUSY. Unbind is available
from the kernel and through sysfs, which is necessary to drop the
module refcount.
