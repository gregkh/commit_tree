bnx2x: Semantic removal and beautification

This patch introduces several small  changes to the driver, none which actually
change any flow:
 1. Removes prototypes of unexisting functions and unused defines.
 2. Fixes alignment and spacing issues.
 3. Changes numeric usage into constants.
 4. Remove unnecessary parenthesis.
