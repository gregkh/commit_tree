blk-throttle: rename throtl_rb_root to throtl_service_queue

throtl_rb_root will be expanded to cover more roles for hierarchy
support.  Rename it to throtl_service_queue and make its fields more
descriptive.

* rb		-> pending_tree
* left		-> first_pending
* count		-> nr_pending
* min_disptime	-> first_pending_disptime

This patch is purely cosmetic.
