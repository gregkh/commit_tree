ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: fix Ether device name

While recasting commit dace48d04dee46a3409d5e13cd98031522e46377 (ARM: shmobile:
R8A7779: add Ether support), I made a typo in the platform device's name: used
underscore instead of hyphen.

However, there's now patch merged to net-next.git renaming the platform device
from "sh-eth" to "r8a777x-ehter", so it makes the most sense to change the name
straight to that one.
