drm/i915: context debug messages

Add some debug messages to help figure out what goes wrong on context
initialization.

Later in the PPGTT series, I ended up having a lot of failures after
reset. In many cases it was extra difficult to debug because I hadn't
even realized that contexts failed to reinitialize after reset (again an
artifact of some later patches).

This fairly benign patch does help debug some potential issues which
arise later.
