This work is part of enabling multi-platform kernels on ARM.

[swarren, reworked Manjunath's patches to split them more logically,
minor re-order of added lines to better match layout of other split-up
HCD drivers and existing code, add MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE, fix
MODULE_LICENSE, adapted to change in earlier patches which removed the
ehci_driver_overrides addition, removed all PM code and solved circular
dependencies.]
