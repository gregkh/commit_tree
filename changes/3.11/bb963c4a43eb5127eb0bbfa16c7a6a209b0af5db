iwlwifi: mvm: set SSID bits for passive channels

Set SSID bitmap for direct scan even on passive channels,
for the passive-to-active feature. Without this patch only
the SSID from probe request template is sent on passive
channels, after passive-to-active switching, causing us to
not find all desired networks.

Remove the unused passive scan mask constant.
