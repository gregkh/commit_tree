x86/mce: Fix mce regression from recent cleanup

In commit 33d7885b594e169256daef652e8d3527b2298e75
   x86/mce: Update MCE severity condition check

We simplified the rules to recognise each classification of recoverable
machine check combining the instruction and data fetch rules into a
single entry based on clarifications in the June 2013 SDM that all
recoverable events would be reported on the unaffected processor with
MCG_STATUS.EIPV=0 and MCG_STATUS.RIPV=1.  Unfortunately the simplified
rule has a couple of bugs.  Fix them here.
