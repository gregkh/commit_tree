ARM: add Cortex-R7 Processor Info

This patch adds processor info for ARM Ltd. Cortex-R7.

The R7 has many similarities to the A9 and though the ACTLR layout is not
identical, the bits associated with cache operations broadcasting and SMP
modes are the same for A9, A5 and R7 (Though in the A-class processors the
same bits toggle TLB-ops broadcasting as well as cache-ops)
