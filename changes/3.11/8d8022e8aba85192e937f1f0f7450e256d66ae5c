module: do percpu allocation after uniqueness check.  No, really!

v3.8-rc1-5-g1fb9341 was supposed to stop parallel kvm loads exhausting
percpu memory on large machines:

    Now we have a new state MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED, we can insert the
    module into the list (and thus guarantee its uniqueness) before we
    allocate the per-cpu region.

In my defence, it didn't actually say the patch did this.  Just that
we "can".

This patch actually *does* it.
