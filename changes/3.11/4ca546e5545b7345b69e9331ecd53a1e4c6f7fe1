NFC: llcp: Fix the well known services endianness

The WKS (Well Known Services) bitmask should be transmitted in big endian
order. Picky implementations will refuse to establish an LLCP link when the
WKS bit 0 is not set to 1. The vast majority of implementations out there
are not that picky though...
