cpufreq: loongson2: fix regression related to clock management

Commit 42913c799 (MIPS: Loongson2: Use clk API instead of direct
dereferences) broke the cpufreq functionality on Loongson2 boards:
clk_set_rate() is called before the CPU frequency table is
initialized, and therefore will always fail.

Fix by moving the clk_set_rate() after the table initialization.
Tested on Lemote FuLoong mini-PC.
