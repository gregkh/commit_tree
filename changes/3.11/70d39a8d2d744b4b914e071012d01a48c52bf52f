ARM: ux500: Supply address location names for the DMA40 DMA controller

The DMA40 controller uses two sets of base addresses. In order to have
the resources setup by the of_platform framework so they are searchable
by name instead of index, we have to set names for them. The names have
to be the same as the ones used to fetch them back out of the resource
structure.
