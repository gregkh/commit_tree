KVM: Fix RTC interrupt coalescing tracking

This reverts most of the f1ed0450a5fac7067590317cbf027f566b6ccbca. After
the commit kvm_apic_set_irq() no longer returns accurate information
about interrupt injection status if injection is done into disabled
APIC. RTC interrupt coalescing tracking relies on the information to be
accurate and cannot recover if it is not.
