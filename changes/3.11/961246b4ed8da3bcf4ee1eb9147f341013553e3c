[PATCH] sparc32: vm_area_struct access for old Sun SPARCs.

Commit e4c6bfd2d79d063017ab19a18915f0bc759f32d9 ("mm: rearrange
vm_area_struct for fewer cache misses") changed the layout of the
vm_area_struct structure, it broke several SPARC32 assembly routines
which used numerical constants for accessing the vm_mm field.

This patch defines the VMA_VM_MM constant to replace the immediate values.
