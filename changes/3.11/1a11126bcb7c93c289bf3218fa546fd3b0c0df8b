tracing: Turn event/id->i_private into call->event.type

event_id_read() is racy, ftrace_event_call can be already freed
by trace_remove_event_call() callers.

Change event_create_dir() to pass "data = call->event.type", this
is all event_id_read() needs. ftrace_event_id_fops no longer needs
tracing_open_generic().

We add the new helper, event_file_data(), to read ->i_private, it
will have more users.

Note: currently ACCESS_ONCE() and "id != 0" check are not needed,
but we are going to change event_remove/rmdir to clear ->i_private.
