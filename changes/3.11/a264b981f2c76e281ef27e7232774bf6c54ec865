net/fec: Don't let ndo_start_xmit return NETDEV_TX_BUSY without link

Don't test for having link and let hardware deal with this situation.

Without this patch I see a machine running an -rt patched Linux being
stuck in sch_direct_xmit when it looses link while there is still a
packet to be sent. In this case the fec_enet_start_xmit routine returned
NETDEV_TX_BUSY which makes the network stack reschedule the packet and
so sch_direct_xmit calls fec_enet_start_xmit again.
I failed to reproduce a complete hang without -rt, but I think the
problem exists there, too.
