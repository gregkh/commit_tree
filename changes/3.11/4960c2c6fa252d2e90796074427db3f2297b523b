Kconfig: remove dangling references to the deleted file

Commit 202dc3fc599c1dded235d3b448d9ca924252e354 (Documentation: remove
obsolete networking/multicast.txt file) deleted the obsolete file. After
the file has been removed, clean up a couple of places where references
to the deleted file were made so that users wouldn't be confused when
they consult the Help menu.
