mm/page_alloc: prevent concurrent updaters of pcp ->batch and ->high

Because we are going to rely upon a careful transision between old and new
->high and ->batch values using memory barriers and will remove
stop_machine(), we need to prevent multiple updaters from interweaving
their memory writes.

Add a simple mutex to protect both update loops.
