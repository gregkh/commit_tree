tracing: Kill trace_cpu struct/members

After the previous changes trace_array_cpu->trace_cpu and
trace_array->trace_cpu becomes write-only. Remove these members
and kill "struct trace_cpu" as well.

As a side effect this also removes memset(per_cpu_memory, 0).
It was not needed, alloc_percpu() returns zero-filled memory.
