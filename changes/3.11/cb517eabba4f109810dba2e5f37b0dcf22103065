Btrfs: cleanup the similar code of the fs root read

There are several functions whose code is similar, such as
  btrfs_find_last_root()
  btrfs_read_fs_root_no_radix()

Besides that, some functions are invoked twice, it is unnecessary,
for example, we are sure that all roots which is found in
  btrfs_find_orphan_roots()
have their orphan items, so it is unnecessary to check the orphan
item again.

So cleanup it.
