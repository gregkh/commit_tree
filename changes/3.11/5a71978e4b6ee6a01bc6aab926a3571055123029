powerpc/eeh: Trace time on first error for PE

We're not expecting that one specific PE got frozen for over 5
times in last hour. Otherwise, the PE will be removed from the
system upon newly coming EEH errors. The patch introduces time
stamp to trace the first error on specific PE in last hour and
function to update that accordingly. Besides, the time stamp
is recovered during PE hotplug path as we did for frozen count.
