ASoC: spear: Convert to use devm_ioremap_resource

Commit 75096579c3ac ("lib: devres: Introduce devm_ioremap_resource()")
introduced devm_ioremap_resource() and deprecated the use of
devm_request_and_ioremap().

devm_request_mem_region is called in devm_ioremap_resource(). Hence that
part can also be removed.

Since devm_ioremap_resource prints error message on failure, there is
no need to print an explicit warning message.
