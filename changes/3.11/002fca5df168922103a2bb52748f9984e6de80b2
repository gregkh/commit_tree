genirq: generic chip: Use DIV_ROUND_UP to calculate numchips

The number of interrupts in a domain may be not divisible by the
number of interrupts each chip handles. Integer division may truncate
the result, thus use DIV_ROUND_UP to count numchips.

Seems all users of irq_alloc_domain_generic_chips() in current code do
not have this issue. I just found the issue while reading the code.
