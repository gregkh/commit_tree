genirq: Set irq thread to RT priority on creation

When a threaded irq handler is installed the irq thread is initially
created on normal scheduling priority. Only after the irq thread is
woken up it sets its priority to RT_FIFO MAX_USER_RT_PRIO/2 itself.

This means that interrupts that occur directly after the irq handler
is installed will be handled on a normal scheduling priority instead
of the realtime priority that one would expect.

Fix this by setting the RT priority on creation of the irq_thread.
