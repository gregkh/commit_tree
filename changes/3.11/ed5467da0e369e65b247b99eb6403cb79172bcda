tracing: Fix fields of struct trace_iterator that are zeroed by mistake

tracing_read_pipe zeros all fields bellow "seq". The declaration contains
a comment about that, but it doesn't help.

The first field is "snapshot", it's true when current open file is
snapshot. Looks obvious, that it should not be zeroed.

The second field is "started". It was converted from cpumask_t to
cpumask_var_t (v2.6.28-4983-g4462344), in other words it was
converted from cpumask to pointer on cpumask.

Currently the reference on "started" memory is lost after the first read
from tracing_read_pipe and a proper object will never be freed.

The "started" is never dereferenced for trace_pipe, because trace_pipe
can't have the TRACE_FILE_ANNOTATE options.
