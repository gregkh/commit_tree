ALSA: hda - Use auto_mute_via_amp=1 for VT1708

We've got bug report wrt many machines with VT1708 (e.g. IBM POS
machines) showing the broken auto-mute behavior.  It turned out that
the problem is that the pin control values of the speaker and line-out
pins are completely ignored.  As a workaround, let's use the newly
introduced feature of the generic parser, to control the mute via amp
on pins.
