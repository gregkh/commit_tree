hw_breakpoint: Simplify list/idx mess in toggle_bp_slot() paths

The enable/disable logic in toggle_bp_slot() is not symmetrical
and imho very confusing. "old_count" in toggle_bp_task_slot() is
actually new_count because this bp was already removed from the
list.

Change toggle_bp_slot() to always call list_add/list_del after
toggle_bp_task_slot(). This way old_idx is task_bp_pinned() and
this entry should be decremented, new_idx is +/-weight and we
need to increment this element. The code/logic looks obvious.
