[SCSI] bfa: kdump fix on 815 and 825 adapters

Root cause: When kernel crashes, On brocade 815/825 adapters,
 bfa IOC state machine and FW doesn't get a notification and
hence are not cleanly shutdown. So registers holding driver/IOC
state information are not reset back to valid disabled/parking
values. This causes subsequent driver initialization to fail
during kdump kernel boot.

Fix description: during the initialization of first PCI function, reset
corresponding register when unclean shutown is detect by reading chip
registers. This will make sure that ioc/fw gets clean re-initialization.
