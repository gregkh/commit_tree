staging: dwc2: use irq_return_t for interrupt handlers

The top-level hcd interrupt handlers already used irq_return_t, but the
functions to which it delegates the actual work and the common irq
handler returned plain ints. In addition, they used the IRQ_RETVAL in
the wrong way (but because of the values of the various constants, this
didn't result in wrong behaviour).
