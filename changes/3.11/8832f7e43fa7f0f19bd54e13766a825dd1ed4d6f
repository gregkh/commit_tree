ACPI / scan: Always call acpi_bus_scan() for bus check notifications

An ACPI_NOTIFY_BUS_CHECK notification means that we should scan the
entire namespace starting from the given handle even if the device
represented by that handle is present (other devices below it may
just have appeared).

For this reason, modify acpi_scan_bus_device_check() to always run
acpi_bus_scan() if the notification being handled is of type
ACPI_NOTIFY_BUS_CHECK.
