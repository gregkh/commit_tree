powerpc: Prevent gcc to re-read the pagetables

GCC is very likely to read the pagetables just once and cache them in
the local stack or in a register, but it is can also decide to re-read
the pagetables. The problem is that the pagetable in those places can
change from under gcc.

With THP/hugetlbfs the pmd (and pgd for hugetlbfs giga pages) can
change under gup_fast. The pages won't be freed untill we finish
gup fast because we have irq disabled and we free these pages via
rcu callback.
