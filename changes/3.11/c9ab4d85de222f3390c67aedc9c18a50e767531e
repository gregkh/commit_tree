neighbour: fix a race in neigh_destroy()

There is a race in neighbour code, because neigh_destroy() uses
skb_queue_purge(&neigh->arp_queue) without holding neighbour lock,
while other parts of the code assume neighbour rwlock is what
protects arp_queue

Convert all skb_queue_purge() calls to the __skb_queue_purge() variant

Use __skb_queue_head_init() instead of skb_queue_head_init()
to make clear we do not use arp_queue.lock

And hold neigh->lock in neigh_destroy() to close the race.
