x86: Fix vrtc_get_time/set_mmss to use new timespec interface

The patch "x86: Increase precision of x86_platform.get/set_wallclock"
changed the x86 platform set_wallclock/get_wallclock interfaces to
use nsec granular timespecs instead of a second granular interface.

However, that patch missed converting the vrtc code, so this patch
converts those functions to use timespecs.

Many thanks to the kbuild test robot for finding this!
