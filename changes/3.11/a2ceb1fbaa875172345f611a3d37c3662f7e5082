libfcoe: Fix meaningless log statement

ctlr_dev was initialized to NULL, and never re-assigned. This
caused the log statement to always report failure. This patch
removes the unused variable and fixes the log statement to always
report 'success', as that is what should be logged if the code
reaches this point.
