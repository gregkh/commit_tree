Btrfs: allow file data clone within a file

We did not allow file data clone within the same file because of
deadlock issues.

However, we now use nested lock to avoid deadlock between the
parent directory and the child file.

So it's safe to do file clone within the same file when the two
ranges are not overlapped.
