DM RAID: Add ability to restore transiently failed devices on resume

This patch adds code to the resume function to check over the devices
in the RAID array.  If any are found to be marked as failed and their
superblocks can be read, an attempt is made to reintegrate them into
the array.  This allows the user to refresh the array with a simple
suspend and resume of the array - rather than having to load a
completely new table, allocate and initialize all the structures and
throw away the old instantiation.
