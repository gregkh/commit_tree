ARM: msm: Migrate to common clock framework

Move the existing clock code in mach-msm to the common clock
framework. We lose our capability to set the rate of and enable a
clock through debugfs. This is ok though because the debugfs
features are mainly used for testing and development of new clock
code.

To maintain compatibility with the original MSM clock code we
make a wrapper for clk_reset() that calls the struct msm_clk
specific reset function. This is necessary for the usb and sdcc
devices on MSM until a better suited API is made available.
