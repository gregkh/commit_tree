s390/kvm: rename RCP_xxx defines to PGSTE_xxx

The RCP byte is a part of the PGSTE value, the existing RCP_xxx names
are inaccurate. As the defines describe bits and pieces of the PGSTE,
the names should start with PGSTE_. The KVM_UR_BIT and KVM_UC_BIT are
part of the PGSTE as well, give them better names as well.
