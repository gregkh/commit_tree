bonding: Convert hw addr handling to sync/unsync, support ucast addresses

This patch converts bonding to use the dev_uc/mc_sync and
dev_uc/mc_sync_multiple functions for updating the hardware addresses
of bonding slaves.

	The existing functions to add or remove addresses are removed,
and their functionality is replaced with calls to dev_mc_sync or
dev_mc_sync_multiple, depending upon the bonding mode.

	Calls to dev_uc_sync and dev_uc_sync_multiple are also added,
so that unicast addresses added to a bond will be properly synced with
its slaves.

	Various functions are renamed to better reflect the new
situation, and relevant comments are updated.
