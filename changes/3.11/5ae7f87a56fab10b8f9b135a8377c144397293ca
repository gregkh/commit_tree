ARM: KVM: Allow host virt timer irq to be different from guest timer virt irq

The arch_timer irq numbers (or PPI numbers) are implementation dependent,
so the host virtual timer irq number can be different from guest virtual
timer irq number.

This patch ensures that host virtual timer irq number is read from DTB and
guest virtual timer irq is determined based on vcpu target type.
