powerpc/pseries: Read/Write oops nvram partition via pstore

IBM's p series machines provide persistent storage for LPARs through NVRAM.
NVRAM's lnx,oops-log partition is used to log oops messages.
Currently the kernel provides the contents of p-series NVRAM only as a
simple stream of bytes via /dev/nvram, which must be interpreted in user
space by the nvram command in the powerpc-utils package.

This patch set exploits the pstore subsystem to expose oops partition in
NVRAM as a separate file in /dev/pstore. For instance, Oops messages will be
stored in a file named [dmesg-nvram-2]. In case pstore registration fails it
will fall back to kmsg_dump mechanism.

This patch will read/write the oops messages from/to this partition via pstore.
