xen/events: initialize local per-cpu mask for all possible events

The sizeof() argument in init_evtchn_cpu_bindings() is incorrect
resulting in only the first 64 (or 32 in 32-bit guests) ports having
their bindings being initialized to VCPU 0.

In most cases this does not cause a problem as request_irq() will set
the irq affinity which will set the correct local per-cpu mask.
However, if the request_irq() is called on a VCPU other than 0, there
is a window between the unmasking of the event and the affinity being
set were an event may be lost because it is not locally unmasked on
any VCPU. If request_irq() is called on VCPU 0 then local irqs are
disabled during the window and the race does not occur.

Fix this by initializing all NR_EVENT_CHANNEL bits in the local
per-cpu masks.
