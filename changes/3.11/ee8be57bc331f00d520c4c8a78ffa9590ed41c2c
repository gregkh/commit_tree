fs/fscache: remove spin_lock() from the condition in while()

The spinlock() within the condition in while() will cause a compile error
if it is not a function. This is not a problem on mainline but it does not
look pretty and there is no reason to do it that way.
That patch writes it a little differently and avoids the double condition.
