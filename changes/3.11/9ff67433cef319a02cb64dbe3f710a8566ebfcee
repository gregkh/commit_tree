powerpc/eeh: Make eeh_phb_pe_get() public

One of the possible cases indicated by P7IOC interrupt is fenced
PHB. For that case, we need fetch the PE corresponding to the PHB
and disable the PHB and all subordinate PCI buses/devices, recover
from the fenced state and eventually enable the whole PHB. We need
one function to fetch the PHB PE outside eeh_pe.c and the patch is
going to make eeh_phb_pe_get() public for that purpose.
