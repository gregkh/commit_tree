    drm/prime: add return check for dma_buf_fd

the failure case handling was fixed up. But in the case when we
already had the buffer exported it changed the return value:
Previously we've return 0 on success, now we return the fd.

This ABI change has been caught by i-g-t/prime_self_import/with_one_bo.
