vme: tsi148: Window reserved for accessing CR/CSR does not need attributes set

The tsi148 driver can be configured to reserve a window for internal
use (as part of the error checking routine). The intialisation of this
window currently configures a set of attributes that are never used
as these are only ever used by the VME core and this window is not
advertised to the core.

Remove configuration of these attributes.
