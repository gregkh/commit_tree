ethtool: make .get_dump_data() harder to misuse by drivers

As the patch "bnx2x: remove zeroing of dump data buffer" showed,
it is too easy implement .get_dump_dataÂ incorrectly in a driver.

Let's make sure drivers cannot get confused by userspace requesting
a too big dump.

Also WARN if the driver sets dump->len to something weird and make
sure the length reported to userspace is the actual length of data
copied to userspace.
