IB/srp: Make HCA completion vector configurable

Several InfiniBand HCAs allow configuring the completion vector per
CQ.  This allows spreading the workload created by IB completion
interrupts over multiple MSI-X vectors and hence over multiple CPU
cores.  In other words, configuring the completion vector properly not
only allows reducing latency on an initiator connected to multiple
SRP targets but also allows improving throughput.
