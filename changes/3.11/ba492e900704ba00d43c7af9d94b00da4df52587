clk: mux: add CLK_MUX_HIWORD_MASK

In both Hisilicon & Rockchip Cortex-A9 based chips, they don't use the
paradigm of reading-changing-writing the register contents.
Instead they use a hiword mask to indicate the changed bits.

When b01 should be set as switching mux, it also needs to indicate
the change by setting hiword mask (b11 << 16).

The patch adds mux flag for this usage.
