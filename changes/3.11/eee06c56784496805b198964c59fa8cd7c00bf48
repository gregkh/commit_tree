jbd2: fix block tag checksum verification brokenness

Al Viro complained of a ton of bogosity with regards to the jbd2 block
tag header checksum.  This one checksum is 16 bits, so cut off the
upper 16 bits and treat it as a 16-bit value and don't mess around
with be32* conversions.  Fortunately metadata checksumming is still
"experimental" and not in a shipping e2fsprogs, so there should be few
users affected by this.
