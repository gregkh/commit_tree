drm/i915: properly set HSW WM_PIPE registers

We were previously calling sandybridge_update_wm on HSW, but the SNB
function didn't really match the HSW specification, so we were just
writing the wrong values.

With this patch, the haswell_update_wm function will set the correct
values for the WM_PIPE registers, but it will still keep all the LP
watermarks disabled.

The patch may look a little bit over-complicated for now, but it's
because much of the infrastructure for setting the LP watermarks is
already in place, so we won't have too much code churn on the patch
that sets the LP watermarks.
