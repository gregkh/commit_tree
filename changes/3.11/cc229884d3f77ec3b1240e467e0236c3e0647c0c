virtio: support unlocked queue poll

This adds a way to check ring empty state after enable_cb outside any
locks. Will be used by virtio_net.

Note: there's room for more optimization: caller is likely to have a
memory barrier already, which means we might be able to get rid of a
barrier here.  Deferring this optimization until we do some
benchmarking.
