blk-throttle: add throtl_grp->service_queue

Currently, there's single service_queue per queue -
throtl_data->service_queue.  All active throtl_grp's are queued on the
queue and dispatched according to their limits.  To support hierarchy,
this will be expanded such that active throtl_grp's form a tree
anchored at throtl_data->service_queue and chained through each
intermediate throtl_grp's service_queue.

This patch adds throtl_grp->service_queue to prepare for hierarchy
support.  The initialization function - throtl_service_queue_init() -
is added and replaces the macro initializer.  The newly added
tg->service_queue isn't used yet.  Following patches will do.
