powerpc/eeh: Single kthread to handle events

We possiblly have multiple kthreads running for multiple EEH errors
(events) and use one spinlock to make the process of handling those
EEH events serialized. That's unnecessary and the patch creates only
one kthread, which is started during EEH core initialization time in
eeh_init(). A new semaphore introduced to count the number of existing
EEH events in the queue and the kthread waiting on the semaphore.
