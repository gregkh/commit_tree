consolidate per-arch stack overflow debugging options

Several architectures have similar stack debugging config options.
They all pretty much do the same thing, some with slightly
differing help text.

This patch changes the architectures to instead enable a Kconfig
boolean, and then use that boolean in the generic Kconfig.debug
to present the actual menu option.  This removes a bunch of
duplication and adds consistency across arches.
