dm: optimize use SRCU and RCU

This patch removes "io_lock" and "map_lock" in struct mapped_device and
"holders" in struct dm_table and replaces these mechanisms with
sleepable-rcu.

Previously, the code would call "dm_get_live_table" and "dm_table_put" to
get and release table. Now, the code is changed to call "dm_get_live_table"
and "dm_put_live_table". dm_get_live_table locks sleepable-rcu and
dm_put_live_table unlocks it.

dm_get_live_table_fast/dm_put_live_table_fast can be used instead of
dm_get_live_table/dm_put_live_table. These *_fast functions use
non-sleepable RCU, so the caller must not block between them.

If the code changes active or inactive dm table, it must call
dm_sync_table before destroying the old table.
