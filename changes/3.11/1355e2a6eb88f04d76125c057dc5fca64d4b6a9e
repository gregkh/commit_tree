ARM: mm: HugeTLB support for LPAE systems.

This patch adds support for hugetlbfs based on the x86 implementation.
It allows mapping of 2MB sections (see Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
for usage). The 64K pages configuration is not supported (section size
is 512MB in this case).

[steve.capper@linaro.org: symbolic constants replace numbers in places.
Split up into multiple files, to simplify future non-LPAE support,
removed huge_pmd_share code, as this is very rarely executed,
Added PROT_NONE support].
