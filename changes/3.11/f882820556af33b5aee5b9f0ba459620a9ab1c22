MAINTAINERS: Refactor device tree maintainership

Device tree bindings require a lot more attention than they used to.
We've got a group of volunteers willing to take over maintaining
bindings. This patch adds them to the MAINTAINERS file.

This group still needs to work out a process for maintainership and how
they are going to work together. I recommend that they set up a shared
tree on git.kernel.org that they each have commit access to similar to
the tip tree or the arm-soc tree, but it is up to them.
