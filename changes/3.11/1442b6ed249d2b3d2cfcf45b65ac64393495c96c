arm64: debug: consolidate software breakpoint handlers

The software breakpoint handlers are hooked in directly from ptrace,
which makes it difficult to add additional handlers for things like
kprobes and kgdb.

This patch moves the handling code into debug-monitors.c, where we can
dispatch to different debug subsystems more easily.
