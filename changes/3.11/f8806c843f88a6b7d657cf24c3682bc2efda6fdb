NFS: Fix writeback performance issue on cache invalidation

If a cache invalidation is triggered, and we happen to have a lot of
writebacks cached at the time, then the call to invalidate_inode_pages2()
will end up calling ->launder_page() on each and every dirty page in order
to sync its contents to disk, thus defeating write coalescing.
The following patch ensures that we try to sync the inode to disk before
calling invalidate_inode_pages2() so that we do the writeback as efficiently
as possible.
