arm: kirkwood: openblocks-a6: group pinmux configurations

Instead of having one separate pinmux configuration for each LED, for
each GPIO of the GPIO header, for each DIP switch, this patch groups
them together in configurations that make sense together: LEDs on one
side, GPIOs of the GPIO header on another side, and DIP switches on
yet another side.
