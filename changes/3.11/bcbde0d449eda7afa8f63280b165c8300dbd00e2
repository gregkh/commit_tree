net: netlink: virtual tap device management

Similarly to the networking receive path with ptype_all taps, we add
the possibility to register netdevices that are for ARPHRD_NETLINK to
the netlink subsystem, so that those can be used for netlink analyzers
resp. debuggers. We do not offer a direct callback function as out-of-tree
modules could do crap with it. Instead, a netdevice must be registered
properly and only receives a clone, managed by the netlink layer. Symbols
are exported as GPL-only.
