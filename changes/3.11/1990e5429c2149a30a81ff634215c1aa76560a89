MIPS: Get rid of MIPS I flag and test macros.

MIPS I is the ancestor of all MIPS ISA and architecture variants.  Anything
ever build in the MIPS empire is either MIPS I or at least contains MIPS I.
If it's running Linux, that is.

So there is little point in having cpu_has_mips_1 because it will always
evaluate as true - though usually only at runtime.  Thus there is no
point in having the MIPS_CPU_ISA_I ISA flag, so get rid of it.

Little complication: traps.c was using a test for a pure MIPS I ISA as
a test for an R3000-style cp0.  To deal with that, use a check for
cpu_has_3kex or cpu_has_4kex instead.

cpu_has_3kex is a new macro.  At the moment its default implementation is
!cpu_has_4kex but this may eventually change if Linux is ever going to
support the oddball MIPS processors R6000 and R8000 so users of either
of these macros should not make any assumptions.
