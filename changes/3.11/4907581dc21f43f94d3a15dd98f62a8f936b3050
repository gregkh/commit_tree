powerpc/eeh: Export confirm_error_lock

An EEH event is created and queued to the event queue for each
ingress EEH error. When there're mutiple EEH errors, we need serialize
the process to keep consistent PE state (flags). The spinlock
"confirm_error_lock" was introduced for the purpose. We'll inject
EEH event upon error reporting interrupts on PowerNV platform. So
we export the spinlock for that to use for consistent PE state.
