drm/i915: Detect invalid scanout pitches

Report back the user error of attempting to setup a CRTC with an invalid
framebuffer pitch. This is trickier than it should be as on gen4, there
is a restriction that tiled surfaces must have a stride less than 16k -
which is less than the largest supported CRTC size.

v2: Fix the limits for gen3
v3: Move check into intel_framebuffer_init() and fix VLV limits. (vsyrjala)
v4: Use idiomatic '>=' for generation checks
