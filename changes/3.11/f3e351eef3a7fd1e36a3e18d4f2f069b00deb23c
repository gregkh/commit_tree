ALSA: hda - Remove NO_PRESENCE bit override for Dell 1420n Laptop

The quirk for Dell laptops with STAC9228 overrides the pin default
config of NID 0x0f to the value with AC_DEFCFG_MISC_NO_PRESENCE bit
on.  I'm not quite sure why this was done so, but can guess that this
was introduced for avoiding this to be muted by another headphone
plug.  Now, after transition to the generic parser, this workaround
rather causes a problem (notably as unexpected speaker mutes) because
the pin is seen as if it's always plugged in.

Since the generic parser can handle multiple headphone plugging
gracefully, we can get rid of this override now.
