drm/i915: Semaphore MBOX update generalization

This replaces the existing MBOX update code with a more generalized
calculation for emitting mbox updates. We also create a sentinel for
doing the updates so we can more abstractly deal with the rings.

When doing MBOX updates the code must be aware of the /other/ rings.
Until now the platforms which supported semaphores had a fixed number of
rings and so it made sense for the code to be very specialized
(hardcoded).

The patch does contain a functional change, but should have no
behavioral changes.
