perf stat: Avoid sending SIGTERM to random processes

This patch fixes a problem with perf stat whereby on termination it may
send a SIGTERM signal to random processes on systems with high PID
recycling. I got some actual bug reports on this.

There is race between the SIGCHLD and sig_atexit() handlers.  This patch
addresses this problem by clearing child_pid in the SIGCHLD handler.
