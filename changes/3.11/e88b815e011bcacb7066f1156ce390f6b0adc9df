drivers/rtc/rtc-sirfsoc.c: add rtc drivers for CSR SiRFprimaII and SiRFatlasVI

On CSR SiRFprimaII/atlasVI, there is a programmable 16-bit divider
(RTC_DIV) that divides the input 32.768KHz clock to the frequency that
users need (E.g.  1 Hz).  The divided real-time clock will be used to
drive a 32-bit counter (RTC_COUNTER) that provides users with the actual
time.

In each cycle of the divided real-time clock, there is a Hertz interrupt
generated to the RISC.  Users can also configure an alarm (RTC_ALARM).
When RTC_COUNTER matches the alarm, there will be an alarm interrupt
generated to the RISC.

The system RTC can generate an alarm wake-up signal to notify the power
controller to wake up from power saving mode.
