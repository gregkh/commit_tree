Memory hotplug / ACPI: Simplify memory removal

Now that the memory offlining should be taken care of by the
companion device offlining code in acpi_scan_hot_remove(), the
ACPI memory hotplug driver doesn't need to offline it in
remove_memory() any more.  Moreover, since the return value of
remove_memory() is not used, it's better to make it be a void
function and trigger a BUG() if the memory scheduled for removal is
not offline.

Change the code in accordance with the above observations.
