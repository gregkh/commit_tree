Btrfs: dont do log_removal in insert_new_root

As for splitting a leaf, root is just the leaf, and tree mod log does not apply
on leaf, so in this case, we don't do log_removal.

As for splitting a node, the old root is kept as a normal node and we have nicely
put records in tree mod log for moving keys and items, so in this case we don't do
that either.

As above, insert_new_root can get rid of log_removal.
