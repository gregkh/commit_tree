input: document gamepad API and add extra keycodes

Until today all gamepad input drivers report their data differently. It is
nearly impossible to write applications for more than one device in a
generic way. Therefore, this patch introduces a uniform gamepad API which
will be used for all new drivers.

Instead of mapping buttons by their labels, we now map them by position.
This allows applications to work with any gamepad regardless of the labels
on the buttons. Furthermore, we standardize the ABS_* codes for analog
triggers and sticks.

For D-Pads the long overdue BTN_DPAD_* codes are introduced. They should
be fairly obvious how to use. To avoid confusion, the action buttons now
have BTN_EAST/SOUTH/WEST/NORTH aliases.
