Revert "ext4: remove no longer used functions in inode.c"

This reverts commit ccb4d7af914e0fe9b2f1022f8ea6c300463fd5e6.

This commit reintroduces functions ext4_block_truncate_page() and
ext4_block_zero_page_range() which has been previously removed in favour
of ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers().

In future commits we want to reintroduce those function and remove
ext4_discard_partial_page_buffers() since it is duplicating some code
and also partially duplicating work of truncate_pagecache_range(),
moreover the old implementation was much clearer.
