tcp: cubic: fix bug in bictcp_acked()

While investigating about strange increase of retransmit rates
on hosts ~24 days after boot, Van found hystart was disabled
if ca->epoch_start was 0, as following condition is true
when tcp_time_stamp high order bit is set.

(s32)(tcp_time_stamp - ca->epoch_start) < HZ

Quoting Van :

 At initialization & after every loss ca->epoch_start is set to zero so
 I believe that the above line will turn off hystart as soon as the 2^31
 bit is set in tcp_time_stamp & hystart will stay off for 24 days.
 I think we've observed that cubic's restart is too aggressive without
 hystart so this might account for the higher drop rate we observe.
