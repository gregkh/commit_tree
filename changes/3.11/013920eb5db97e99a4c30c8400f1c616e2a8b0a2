sunrpc/cache: ensure items removed from cache do not have pending upcalls.

It is possible for a race to set CACHE_PENDING after cache_clean()
has removed a cache entry from the cache.
If CACHE_PENDING is still set when the entry is finally 'put',
the cache_dequeue() will never happen and we can leak memory.

So set a new flag 'CACHE_CLEANED' when we remove something from
the cache, and don't queue any upcall if it is set.

If CACHE_PENDING is set before CACHE_CLEANED, the call that
cache_clean() makes to cache_fresh_unlocked() will free memory
as needed.  If CACHE_PENDING is set after CACHE_CLEANED, the
test in sunrpc_cache_pipe_upcall will ensure that the memory
is not allocated.
