Btrfs: cleanup unnecessary assignment when cleaning up all the residual transaction

When we umount a fs with serious errors, we will invoke btrfs_cleanup_transactions()
to clean up the residual transaction. At this time, It is impossible to start a new
transaction, so we needn't assign trans_no_join to 1, and also needn't clear running
transaction every time we destroy a residual transaction.
