[media] hdpvr: fix iteration over uninitialized lists in hdpvr_probe()

free_buff_list and rec_buff_list are initialized in the middle of hdpvr_probe(),
but if something bad happens before that, error handling code calls hdpvr_delete(),
which contains iteration over the lists (via hdpvr_free_buffers()).
The patch moves the lists initialization to the beginning and by the way fixes
goto label in error handling of registering videodev.
