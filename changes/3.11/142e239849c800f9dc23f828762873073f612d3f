drm/i915: Add bit field to record which pins have received HPD events (v3)

This way it is possible to limit 're'-detect() of displays to connectors
which have received an HPD event.

v2: Reordered drm_i915_private: Move hpd_event_bits to hpd state tracking.
v3: Fixed merge conflicts with previous patches.
