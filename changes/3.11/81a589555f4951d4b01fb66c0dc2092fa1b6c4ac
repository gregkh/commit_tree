staging: dwc2: fix thinko in dwc2_hc_set_even_odd_frame()

I screwed up the sense of this if() statement while porting our
vendor driver to create the dwc2 driver. This caused frame overrun
errors on periodic transfers when there were other transfers
active in the same (micro)frame.

With this fix, the dwc2 driver now works on the Raspberry Pi
platform even with the USB Ethernet controller enabled, where
before that would cause all USB devices to stop working.

Thanks to Ray Jui and Jerry Lin at Broadcom for tracking this down.
