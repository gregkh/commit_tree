cpu: fix "crash_notes" and "crash_notes_size" leaks in register_cpu()

"crash_notes" and "crash_notes_size" are dynamically created
with device_create_file() but aren't deleted anywhere.
Define "crash_notes" and "crash_notes_size" statically via
attribute groups so that device_register would create them
automatically and files would be destroyed when CPU is destroyed.
