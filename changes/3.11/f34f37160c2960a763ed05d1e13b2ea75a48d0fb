ARM: OMAP2+: gpmc: get number of useable GPMC chip-selects via DT

This patch enables usage of DT property 'gpmc,num-cs' as already documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/bus/ti-gpmc.txt

Though GPMC hardware supports upto 8 chip-selects, but all chip-selects may
not be available for use because:
- chip-select pin may not be bonded out at SoC device boundary.
- chip-select pin-mux may conflict with other pins usage.
- board level constrains.

gpmc,num-cs allows user to configure maximum number of GPMC chip-selects
available for use on any given platform. This ensures:
- GPMC child nodes having chip-selects within allowed range are only probed.
- And un-used GPMC chip-selects remain blocked.(may be for security reasons).
