[media] usbvision-video: fix memory leak of alt_max_pkt_size

1. usbvision->alt_max_pkt_size is not deallocated anywhere.
2. if allocation of usbvision->alt_max_pkt_size fails,
there is no proper deallocation of already acquired resources.
The patch adds kfree(usbvision->alt_max_pkt_size) to
usbvision_release() as soon as other deallocations happen there.
It calls usbvision_release() if allocation of
usbvision->alt_max_pkt_size fails as soon as usbvision_release()
is safe to work with incompletely initialized usbvision structure.
