dma: tegra: avoid channel lock up after free

Lock scenario: Channel 1 was allocated and prepared as slave_sg, used and freed.
Now preparation of cyclic dma on channel 1 will fail with err "DMA configuration
conflict" because tdc->isr_handler still setted to handle_once_dma_done.

This happens because tegra_dma_abort_all() won't be called on channel freeing
if pending list is empty and channel not busy. We need to clear isr_handler
on channel freeing to avoid locking.
