blk-throttle: add backlink pointer from throtl_grp to throtl_data

Add throtl_grp->td so that the td (throtl_data) a given tg
(throtl_grp) belongs to can be determined, and remove @td argument
from functions which take both @td and @tg as the former now can be
determined from the latter.

This generally simplifies the code and removes a number of cases where
@td is passed as an argument without being actually used.  This will
also help hierarchy support implementation.

While at it, in multi-line conditions, move the logical operators
leading broken lines to the end of the previous line.
