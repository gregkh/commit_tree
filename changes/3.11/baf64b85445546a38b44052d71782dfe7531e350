perf/x86: Fix incorrect use of do_div() in NMI warning

I completely botched understanding the calling conventions of
do_div().  I assumed that do_div() returned the result instead
of realizing that it modifies its argument and returns a
remainder.  The side-effect from this would be bogus numbers
for the "msecs" value in the warning messages:

	INFO: NMI handler (perf_event_nmi_handler) took too long to run: 0.114 msecs

Note, there was a second fix posted by Stephane Eranian for
a separate patch which I also botched:
