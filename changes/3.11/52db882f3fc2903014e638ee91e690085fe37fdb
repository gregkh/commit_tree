net: sctp: migrate cookie life from timeval to ktime

Currently, SCTP code defines its own timeval functions (since timeval
is rarely used inside the kernel by others), namely tv_lt() and
TIMEVAL_ADD() macros, that operate on SCTP cookie expiration.

We might as well remove all those, and operate directly on ktime
structures for a couple of reasons: ktime is available on all archs;
complexity of ktime calculations depending on the arch is less than
(reduces to a simple arithmetic operations on archs with
BITS_PER_LONG == 64 or CONFIG_KTIME_SCALAR) or equal to timeval
functions (other archs); code becomes more readable; macros can be
thrown out.
