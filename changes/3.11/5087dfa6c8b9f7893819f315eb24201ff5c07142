KVM: s390: Privileged operation checks moved to instruction handlers

We need more fine-grained control about the point in time when we check
for privileged instructions, since the exceptions that can happen during
an instruction have a well-defined priority. For example, for the PFMF
instruction, the check for PGM_PRIVILEGED_OP must happen after the check
for PGM_OPERATION since the latter has a higher precedence - thus the
check for privileged operation must not be done in kvm_s390_handle_b9()
already.
