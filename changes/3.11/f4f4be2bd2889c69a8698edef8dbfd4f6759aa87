cgroup: use kzalloc() instead of kmalloc()

There's no point in using kmalloc() instead of the clearing variant
for trivial stuff.  We can live dangerously elsewhere.  Use kzalloc()
instead and drop 0 inits.

While at it, do trivial code reorganization in cgroup_file_open().

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.

v2: I was caught in the very distant past where list_del() didn't
    poison and the initial version converted list_del()s to
    list_del_init()s too.  Li and Kent took me out of the stasis
    chamber.
