staging: comedi: addi_apci_3xxx: introduce a private boardinfo definition

The struct addi_board definition from the addi-data "common" code is
very bloated. Introduce a private struct apci3xxx_boardinfo that just
has the data needed by this driver.

Move the #include "addi-data/hwdrv_apci3xxx.c" so it will have the new
struct definition.
