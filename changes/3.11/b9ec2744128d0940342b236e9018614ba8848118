mmc: tmio: reset the controller after power-up

This fixes two reported problems:
1. after a system resume the controller isn't functioning until a command
   runs on a timeout and a controller reset is performed.
2. if a card is ejected during a running write operation, its re-insertion
   isn't detected.
