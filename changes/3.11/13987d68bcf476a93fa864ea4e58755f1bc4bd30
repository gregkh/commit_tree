ARM: dma-mapping: convert DMA direction into IOMMU protection attributes

IOMMU mappings take a prot parameter, identifying the protection bits
to enforce on the newly created mapping (READ or WRITE). The ARM
dma-mapping framework currently just passes 0 as the prot argument,
resulting in faulting mappings.

This patch infers the protection attributes based on the direction of
the DMA transfer.
