xfs: fix the symbolic link assert in xfs_ifree

Adding an extended attribute to a symbolic link can force that
link to an remote extent. xfs_inactive() incorrectly assumes
that any symbolic link small enough to be in the inode core
is incore, resulting in the remote extent to not be removed.
xfs_ifree() will assert on presence of this leaked remote extent.
