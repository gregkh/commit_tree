blk-throttle: remove spurious throtl_enqueue_tg() call from throtl_select_dispatch()

throtl_select_dispatch() calls throtl_enqueue_tg() right after
tg_update_disptime(), which always calls the function anyway.  The
call is, while harmless, unnecessary.  Remove it.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior difference.
