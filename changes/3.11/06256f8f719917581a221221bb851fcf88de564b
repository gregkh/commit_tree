c6x: normalize global variables exported by vmlinux.lds

Normalize global variables exported by vmlinux.lds to conform usage
guidelines from include/asm-generic/sections.h.

Use _text to mark the start of the kernel image including the head text,
and _stext to mark the start of the .text section.

This patch also fixes possible bugs due to current address layout that
[__init_begin, __init_end] is a sub-range of [_stext, _etext] and pages
within range [__init_begin, __init_end] will be freed by free_initmem().
