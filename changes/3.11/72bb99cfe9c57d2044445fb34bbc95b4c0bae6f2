staging: android: logger: Correct write offset reset on error

In the situation that a writer fails to copy data from userspace it will reset
the write offset to the value it had before it went to sleep. This discarding
any messages written while aquiring the mutex.

Therefore the reset offset needs to be retrieved after acquiring the mutex.
