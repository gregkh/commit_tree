coredump: kill call_count, add core_name_size

Imho, "atomic_t call_count" is ugly and should die.  It buys nothing and
in fact it can grow more than necessary, expand doesn't check if it was
already incremented by another task.

Kill it, and introduce "static int core_name_size" updated by
expand_corename().  This is obviously racy too but harmless, and
core_name_size never grows for no reason.

We do not bother to to calculate the "right" new size, we simply do
kmalloc(size_we_need) and use ksize() to rely on kmalloc_index's decision.

Finally change format_corename() to use expand_corename(), krealloc(NULL)
is fine.
