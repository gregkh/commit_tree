iio: lps331ap: Fix wrong in_pressure_scale output value

This patch fixes improper in_pressure_scale output that is
returned by the lps331ap barometer sensor driver. According
to the documentation the pressure after applying the scale has to
be expressed in kilopascal units. With erroneous implementation
the scale value larger by two orders of magnitude is returned -
2441410 instead of 24414.
