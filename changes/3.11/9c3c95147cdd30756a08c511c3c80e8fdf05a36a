ARM: ux500: Remove DMA address look-up table

DMA addresses are now passed as part of the dmaengine API by invoking
dmaengine_slave_config(). So there's no requirement for the DMA40
driver to look them up in a table provided by platform data. This
method does not fit in well using Device Tree either.
