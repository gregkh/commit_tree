mm: activate !PageLRU pages on mark_page_accessed if page is on local pagevec

If a page is on a pagevec then it is !PageLRU and mark_page_accessed()
may fail to move a page to the active list as expected.  Now that the
LRU is selected at LRU drain time, mark pages PageActive if they are on
the local pagevec so it gets moved to the correct list at LRU drain
time.  Using a debugging patch it was found that for a simple git
checkout based workload that pages were never added to the active file
list in practice but with this patch applied they are.

				before   after
LRU Add Active File                  0      750583
LRU Add Active Anon            2640587     2702818
LRU Add Inactive File          8833662     8068353
LRU Add Inactive Anon              207         200

Note that only pages on the local pagevec are considered on purpose.  A
!PageLRU page could be in the process of being released, reclaimed,
migrated or on a remote pagevec that is currently being drained.
Marking it PageActive is vunerable to races where PageLRU and Active
bits are checked at the wrong time.  Page reclaim will trigger
VM_BUG_ONs but depending on when the race hits, it could also free a
PageActive page to the page allocator and trigger a bad_page warning.
Similarly a potential race exists between a per-cpu drain on a pagevec
list and an activation on a remote CPU.

				lru_add_drain_cpu
				__pagevec_lru_add
				  lru = page_lru(page);
mark_page_accessed
  if (PageLRU(page))
    activate_page
  else
    SetPageActive
				  SetPageLRU(page);
				  add_page_to_lru_list(page, lruvec, lru);

In this case a PageActive page is added to the inactivate list and later
the inactive/active stats will get skewed.  While the PageActive checks
in vmscan could be removed and potentially dealt with, a skew in the
statistics would be very difficult to detect.  Hence this patch deals
just with the common case where a page being marked accessed has just
been added to the local pagevec.
