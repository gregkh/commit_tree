sh_eth: add IRQ flags to 'struct sh_eth_cpu_data'

The driver supports some SH and SH-Mobile SOCs. There are SOCs with two or more
Ethernet devices, for these we need to pass IRQF_SHARED to request_irq().  Add
the 'irq_flags' field to the 'struct sh_eth_cpu_data' instead of #ifdef'fery.

changelog, reworded the subject, changing the prefix.]
