locks: move file_lock_list to a set of percpu hlist_heads and convert file_lock_lock to an lglock

The file_lock_list is only used for /proc/locks. The vastly common case
is for locks to be put onto the list and come off again, without ever
being traversed.

Help optimize for this use-case by moving to percpu hlist_head-s. At the
same time, we can make the locking less contentious by moving to an
lglock. When iterating over the lists for /proc/locks, we must take the
global lock and then iterate over each CPU's list in turn.

This change necessitates a new fl_link_cpu field to keep track of which
CPU the entry is on. On x86_64 at least, this field is placed within an
existing hole in the struct to avoid growing the size.
