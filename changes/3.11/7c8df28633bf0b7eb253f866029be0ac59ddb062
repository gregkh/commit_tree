ptrace: revert "Prepare to fix racy accesses on task breakpoints"

This reverts commit bf26c018490c ("Prepare to fix racy accesses on task
breakpoints").

The patch was fine but we can no longer race with SIGKILL after commit
9899d11f6544 ("ptrace: ensure arch_ptrace/ptrace_request can never race
with SIGKILL"), the __TASK_TRACED tracee can't be woken up and
->ptrace_bps[] can't go away.

Now that ptrace_get_breakpoints/ptrace_put_breakpoints have no callers,
we can kill them and remove task->ptrace_bp_refcnt.
