Btrfs: remove unnecessary varient ->num_joined in btrfs_transaction structure

We used ->num_joined track if there were some writers which join the current
transaction when the committer was sleeping. If some writers joined the current
transaction, we has to continue the while loop to do some necessary stuff, such
as flush the ordered operations. But it is unnecessary because we will do it
after the while loop.

Besides that, tracking ->num_joined would make the committer drop into the while
loop when there are lots of internal writers(TRANS_JOIN).

So we remove ->num_joined and don't track if there are some writers which join
the current transaction when the committer is sleeping.
