tracing: Add ref_data to function and fgraph tracer structs

The selftest for function and function graph tracers are defined as
__init, as they are only executed at boot up. The "tracer" structs
that are associated to those tracers are not setup as __init as they
are used after boot. To stop mismatch warnings, those structures
need to be annotated with __ref_data.

Currently, the tracer structures are defined to __read_mostly, as they
do not really change. But in the future they should be converted to
consts, but that will take a little work because they have a "next"
pointer that gets updated when they are registered. That will have to
wait till the next major release.
