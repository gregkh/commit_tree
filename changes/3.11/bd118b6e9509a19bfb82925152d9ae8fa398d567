ibm-ethernet: delete stale MCA and duplicate PSERIES dependency

MCA support has been removed but this dependency escaped removal.
Also, there is a duplicate PPC_PSERIES dependency that appeared
when the ethernet drivers were separated into vendor/model
specific directories, so we remove that here as well.
