ARM: KVM: use phys_addr_t instead of unsigned long long for HYP PGDs

HYP PGDs are passed around as phys_addr_t, except just before calling
into the hypervisor init code, where they are cast to a rather weird
unsigned long long.

Just keep them around as phys_addr_t, which is what makes the most
sense.
