xen/time: Encapsulate the struct clock_event_device in another structure.

We don't do any code movement. We just encapsulate the struct clock_event_device
in a new structure which contains said structure and a pointer to
a char *name. The 'name' will be used in 'xen/time: Don't leak interrupt
name when offlining'.
