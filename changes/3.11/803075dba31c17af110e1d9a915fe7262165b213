x86/iommu/vt-d: Expand interrupt remapping quirk to cover x58 chipset

Recently we added an early quirk to detect 5500/5520 chipsets
with early revisions that had problems with irq draining with
interrupt remapping enabled:

      iommu/vt-d: add quirk for broken interrupt remapping on 55XX chipsets

It turns out this same problem is present in the intel X58
chipset as well. See errata 69 here:

  http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/chipsets/x58-express-specification-update.html

This patch extends the pci early quirk so that the chip
devices/revisions specified in the above update are also covered
in the same way:
