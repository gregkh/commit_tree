rtmutex: Document rt_mutex_adjust_prio_chain()

Parameters and usage of rt_mutex_adjust_prio_chain() are already
documented in Documentation/rt-mutex-design.txt. However, since this
function is called from several paths with different semantics (related
to the arguments), it is handy to have a quick reference directly in
the code.
