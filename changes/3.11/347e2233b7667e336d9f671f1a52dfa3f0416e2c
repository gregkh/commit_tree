SUNRPC: Fix memory corruption issue on 32-bit highmem systems

Some architectures, such as ARM-32 do not return the same base address
when you call kmap_atomic() twice on the same page.
This causes problems for the memmove() call in the XDR helper routine
"_shift_data_right_pages()", since it defeats the detection of
overlapping memory ranges, and has been seen to corrupt memory.

The fix is to distinguish between the case where we're doing an
inter-page copy or not. In the former case of we know that the memory
ranges cannot possibly overlap, so we can additionally micro-optimise
by replacing memmove() with memcpy().
