phy-rcar-usb: handle platform data

Set the USBPCTRL0 register from the passed platform data in rcar_usb_phy_init();
don't reset it to 0 in  rcar_usb_phy_shutdown()  anymore as that does not make
sense.  Also, don't allow the driver's probe to succeed when the platform data
are not supplied with a device.

The patch has been tested on the Marzen and BOCK-W boards.
