ARM: tegra: make tegra_resume can work for Tegra114

Tegra114 had a newer flow controller hardware that makes its behavior and
configurations are different with other Tegra series. We fix the common
resume function of tegra_resume to make it can work on Tegra114 by checking
SoC ID. And also checking CPU primary part number to isolate the support
code for Cortex A9 and A15.
