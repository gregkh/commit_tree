mm: invoke oom-killer from remaining unconverted page fault handlers

A few remaining architectures directly kill the page faulting task in an
out of memory situation.  This is usually not a good idea since that
task might not even use a significant amount of memory and so may not be
the optimal victim to resolve the situation.

Since 2.6.29's 1c0fe6e ("mm: invoke oom-killer from page fault") there
is a hook that architecture page fault handlers are supposed to call to
invoke the OOM killer and let it pick the right task to kill.  Convert
the remaining architectures over to this hook.

To have the previous behavior of simply taking out the faulting task the
vm.oom_kill_allocating_task sysctl can be set to 1.
