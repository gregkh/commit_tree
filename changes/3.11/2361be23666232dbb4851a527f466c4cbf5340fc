cpufreq: Don't create empty /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq directory

When we don't have any file in cpu/cpufreq directory we shouldn't
create it. Specially with the introduction of per-policy governor
instance patchset, even governors are moved to
cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/governor-name directory and so this directory is
just not required.

Lets have it only when required.
