VFS: collect_mounts() should return an ERR_PTR

This should actually be returning an ERR_PTR on error instead of NULL.
That was how it was designed and all the callers expect it.

[AV: actually, that's what "VFS: Make clone_mnt()/copy_tree()/collect_mounts()
return errors" missed - originally collect_mounts() was expected to return
NULL on failure]
