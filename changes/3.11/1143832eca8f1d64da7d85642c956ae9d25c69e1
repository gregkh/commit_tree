USB: serial: ports: add minor and port number

The usb_serial_port structure had the number field, which was the minor
number for the port, which almost no one really cared about.  They
really wanted the number of the port within the device, which you had to
subtract from the minor of the parent usb_serial_device structure.  To
clean this up, provide the real minor number of the port, and the number
of the port within the serial device separately, as these numbers might
not be related in the future.

Bonus is that this cleans up a lot of logic in the drivers, and saves
lines overall.
