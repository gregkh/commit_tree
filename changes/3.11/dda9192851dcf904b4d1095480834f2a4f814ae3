net: sctp: remove SCTP_STATIC macro

SCTP_STATIC is just another define for the static keyword. It's use
is inconsistent in the SCTP code anyway and it was introduced in the
initial implementation of SCTP in 2.5. We have a regression suite in
lksctp-tools, but this is for user space only, so noone makes use of
this macro anymore. The kernel test suite for 2.5 is incompatible with
the current SCTP code anyway.

So simply Remove it, to be more consistent with the rest of the kernel
code.
