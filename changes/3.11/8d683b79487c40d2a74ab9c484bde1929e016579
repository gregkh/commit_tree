iwlwifi: mvm: Fix quota command settings

According to the FW implementation, the quota command should
have a valid entry for each active binding (where 'active' in
this context means that the binding is known to the FW). In case
the binding should not get any quota, the 'quota' should be set
to zero.

Not setting an 0 quota for an active binding when all the MACs
in the binding are idle, i.e., not associated in case of managed
interface, will result in preventing the FW scheduler from entering
IDLE state and the FW from transitioning to low PS.
