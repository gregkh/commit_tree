ACPI / battery: Fix parsing _BIX return value

The _BIX method returns extended battery info as a package.
According the ACPI spec (ACPI 5, Section 10.2.2.2), the first member
of that package should be "Revision".  However, the current ACPI
battery driver treats the first member as "Power Unit" which should
be the second member.  This causes the result of _BIX return data
parsing to be incorrect.

Fix this by adding a new member called 'revision' to struct
acpi_battery and adding the offsetof() information on it to
extended_info_offsets[] as the first row.
