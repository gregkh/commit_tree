cfg80211: hold BSS over association process

This fixes the potential issue that the BSS struct that we use
and later assign to wdev->current_bss is removed from the scan
list while associating.

Also warn when we don't have a BSS struct in connect_result
unless it's from a driver that only has the connect() API.
