perf/x86/intel: Add Haswell PEBS record support

Add support for the Haswell extended (fmt2) PEBS format.

It has a superset of the nhm (fmt1) PEBS fields, but has a
longer record so we need to adjust the code paths.

The main advantage is the new "EventingRip" support which
directly gives the instruction, not off-by-one instruction. So
with precise == 2 we use that directly and don't try to use LBRs
and walking basic blocks. This lowers the overhead of using
precise significantly.

Some other features are added in later patches.
