sched: Rename sched.c as sched/core.c in comments and Documentation

Most of the stuff from kernel/sched.c was moved to kernel/sched/core.c long time
back and the comments/Documentation never got updated.

I figured it out when I was going through sched-domains.txt and so thought of
fixing it globally.

I haven't crossed check if the stuff that is referenced in sched/core.c by all
these files is still present and hasn't changed as that wasn't the motive behind
this patch.
