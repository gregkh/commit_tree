s390/zcrypt: Alias for new zcrypt device driver base module

The zcrypt device driver has been split into base/bus module, api-module,
card modules and message type modules. The base module has been renamed
from z90crypt to ap.
A module alias (with the well-known z90crypt identifier) will be introduced
that enable users to use their existing way to load the zcrypt device driver.
