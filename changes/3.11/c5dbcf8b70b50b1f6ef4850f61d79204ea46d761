pps-gpio: add device-tree binding and support

Instead of allocating a struct pps_gpio_platform_data in the DT case,
store the necessary information in struct pps_gpio_device_data itself.
This avoids an additional allocation and the ifdef.  It also gets rid of
some indirection.

Also use dev_err instead of pr_err in the changed code.
