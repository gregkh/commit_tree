CIFS: Fix a deadlock when a file is reopened

If we request reading or writing on a file that needs to be
reopened, it causes the deadlock: we are already holding rw
semaphore for reading and then we try to acquire it for writing
in cifs_relock_file. Fix this by acquiring the semaphore for
reading in cifs_relock_file due to we don't make any changes in
locks and don't need a write access.
