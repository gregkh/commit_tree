[SCSI] bfa: Fix 1860 port initialize when ATC is enabled

On Xen kernels, if ATC (address translation cache) is enabled, the
first PCIe DMA read from the adapter fails with an error. This is due to
a bug ASIC, which leads to a failure of 1860 ports to be initialised.

This patch includes the fix to disable Invalidated Tag Match Enable
capability by setting the bit 26 of CHIP_MISC_PRG to 0, by default it is
set to 1.
