cpuset: allow to keep tasks in empty cpusets

To achieve this:

- We call update_tasks_cpumask/nodemask() for empty cpusets when
hotplug happens, instead of moving tasks out of them.

- When a cpuset's masks are changed by writing cpuset.cpus/mems,
we also update tasks in child cpusets which are empty.

v3:
- do propagation work in one place for both hotplug and unplug

v2:
- drop rcu_read_lock before calling update_task_nodemask() and
  update_task_cpumask(), instead of using workqueue.
- add documentation in include/linux/cgroup.h
