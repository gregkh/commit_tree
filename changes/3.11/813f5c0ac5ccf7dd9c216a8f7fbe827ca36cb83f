[media] media: Change media device link_notify behaviour

Currently the media device link_notify callback is invoked before the
actual change of state of a link when the link is being enabled, and
after the actual change of state when the link is being disabled.
This doesn't allow a media device driver to perform any operations
on a full graph before a link is disabled, as well as performing
any tasks on a modified graph right after a link's state is changed.
This patch modifies signature of the link_notify callback. This
callback is now called always before and after a link's state change.
To distinguish the notifications a 'notification' argument is added
to the link_notify callback: MEDIA_DEV_NOTIFY_PRE_LINK_CH indicates
notification before link's state change and
MEDIA_DEV_NOTIFY_POST_LINK_CH corresponds to a notification after
link flags change.
