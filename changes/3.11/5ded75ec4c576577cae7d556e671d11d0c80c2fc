[readdir] convert ext3

new helper: dir_relax(inode).  Call when you are in location that will
_not_ be invalidated by directory modifications (block boundary, in case
of ext*).  Returns whether the directory has survived (dropping i_mutex
allows rmdir to kill the sucker; if it returns false to us, ->iterate()
is obviously done)
