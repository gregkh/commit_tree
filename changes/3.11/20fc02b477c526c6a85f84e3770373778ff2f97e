mm/vmalloc.c: rename VM_UNLIST to VM_UNINITIALIZED

VM_UNLIST was used to indicate that the vm_struct is not listed in
vmlist.

But after commit 4341fa454796 ("mm, vmalloc: remove list management of
vmlist after initializing vmalloc"), the meaning of this flag changed.
It now means the vm_struct is not fully initialized.  So renaming it to
VM_UNINITIALIZED seems more reasonable.

Also change clear_vm_unlist to clear_vm_uninitialized_flag.
