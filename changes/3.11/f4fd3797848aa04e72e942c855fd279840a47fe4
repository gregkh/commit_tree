acpi-cpufreq: Add new sysfs attribute freqdomain_cpus

Commits fcf8058 (cpufreq: Simplify cpufreq_add_dev()) and aa77a52
(cpufreq: acpi-cpufreq: Don't set policy->related_cpus from .init())
changed the contents of the "related_cpus" sysfs attribute on systems
where acpi-cpufreq is used and user space can't get the list of CPUs
which are in the same hardware coordination CPU domain (provided by
the ACPI AML method _PSD) via "related_cpus" any more.

To make up for that loss add a new sysfs attribute "freqdomian_cpus"
for the acpi-cpufreq driver which exposes the list of CPUs in the
same domain regardless of whether it is coordinated by hardware or
software.
