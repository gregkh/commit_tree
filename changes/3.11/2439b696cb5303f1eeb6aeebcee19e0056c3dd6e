rcu: Shrink TINY_RCU by moving exit_rcu()

Now that TINY_PREEMPT_RCU is no more, exit_rcu() is always an empty
function.  But if TINY_RCU is going to have an empty function, it should
be in include/linux/rcutiny.h, where it does not bloat the kernel.
This commit therefore moves exit_rcu() out of kernel/rcupdate.c to
kernel/rcutree_plugin.h, and places a static inline empty function in
include/linux/rcutiny.h in order to shrink TINY_RCU a bit.
