HID: wiimote: wake up if output queue failed

Our output queue is asynchronous but synchronous reports may wait for a
response to their request. Therefore, wake them up unconditionally if an
output report couldn't be sent. But keep the report ID intact so we don't
incorrectly assume our request succeeded.

Note that the underlying connection is required to be reliable and does
retransmission itself. So it is safe to assume that if the transmission
fails, the device is in inconsistent state. Hence, we abort every request
if any output report fails. No need to verify which report failed.
