cifs: use posix_unblock_lock instead of locks_delete_block

commit 66189be74 (CIFS: Fix VFS lock usage for oplocked files) exported
the locks_delete_block symbol. There's already an exported helper
function that provides this capability however, so make cifs use that
instead and turn locks_delete_block back into a static function.

Note that if fl->fl_next == NULL then this lock has already been through
locks_delete_block(), so we should be OK to ignore an ENOENT error here
and simply not retry the lock.
