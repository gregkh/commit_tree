cgroup: CGRP_ROOT_SUBSYS_BOUND should also be ignored when mounting an existing hierarchy

0ce6cba357 ("cgroup: CGRP_ROOT_SUBSYS_BOUND should be ignored when
comparing mount options") only updated the remount path but
CGRP_ROOT_SUBSYS_BOUND should also be ignored when comparing options
while mounting an existing hierarchy.  As option mismatch triggers a
warning but doesn't fail the mount without sane_behavior, this only
triggers a spurious warning message.

Fix it by only comparing CGRP_ROOT_OPTION_MASK bits when comparing new
and existing root options.
