bnx2x: Count number of possible FCoE interfaces

Commit 0eb43b4bb081a1a22574daab9c05286a600dd7fe
"bnx2x, bnx2fc: Use per port max exchange resources" has changed the number
of available FCoE exchanges, even in scenarios when some of the functions has
no FCoE support; This needlessly degraded the available resources.

Remedy this by calculating the maximal number of functions that may actually
utilize said connection.
