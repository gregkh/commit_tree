Revert "ipv6: Don't depend on per socket memory for neighbour discovery messages"

This reverts commit 1f324e38870cc09659cf23bc626f1b8869e201f2.

It seems to cause regressions, and in particular the output path
really depends upon there being a socket attached to skb->sk for
checks such as sk_mc_loop(skb->sk) for example.  See ip6_output_finish2().
