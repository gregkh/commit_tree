virtio: console: return -ENODEV on all read operations after unplug

If a port gets unplugged while a user is blocked on read(), -ENODEV is
returned.  However, subsequent read()s returned 0, indicating there's no
host-side connection (but not indicating the device went away).

This also happened when a port was unplugged and the user didn't have
any blocking operation pending.  If the user didn't monitor the SIGIO
signal, they won't have a chance to find out if the port went away.

Fix by returning -ENODEV on all read()s after the port gets unplugged.
write() already behaves this way.
