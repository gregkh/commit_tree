drm/i915: Introduce VECS: the 4th ring

The video enhancement command streamer is a new ring on HSW which does
what it sounds like it does. This patch provides the most minimal
inception of the ring.

In order to support a new ring, we need to bump the number. The patch
may look trivial to the untrained eye, but bumping the number of rings
is a bit scary. As such the patch is not terribly useful by itself, but
a pretty nice place to find issues during a bisection.
