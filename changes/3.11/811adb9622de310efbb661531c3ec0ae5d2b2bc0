HID: i2c-hid: support sending HID output reports using the output register

The current i2c hid driver does not support sending HID output reports using
the output register for devices which support receiving reports through this
method. This patch determines which method to use to send output reports based
 on the value of wMaxOutputLength in the device's HID descriptor.
