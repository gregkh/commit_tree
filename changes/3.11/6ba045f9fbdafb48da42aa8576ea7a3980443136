MIPS: Move generated code to .text for microMIPS

Prepare of a next patch which will call tlbmiss_handler_setup_pgd on
microMIPS. MicroMIPS complains if the called code s not in the .text
section. To fix this we generate code into space reserved in
arch/mips/mm/tlb-funcs.S

While there, move the rest of the generated functions (handle_tlbl,
handle_tlbs, handle_tlbm) to the same file.
