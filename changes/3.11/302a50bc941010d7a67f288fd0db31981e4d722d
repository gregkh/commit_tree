xfrm: Fix potential null pointer dereference in xdst_queue_output

The net_device might be not set on the skb when we try refcounting.
This leads to a null pointer dereference in xdst_queue_output().
It turned out that the refcount to the net_device is not needed
after all. The dst_entry has a refcount to the net_device before
we queue the skb, so it can't go away. Therefore we can remove the
refcount on queueing to fix the null pointer dereference.
