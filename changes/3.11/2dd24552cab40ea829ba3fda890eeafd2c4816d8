drm/i915: factor out GMCH panel fitting code and use for eDP v3

This gets the panel fitter working on eDP on VLV, and should also apply
to eDP panels on G4x chipsets (if we ever detect and mark an all-in-one
panel as eDP anyway).

A few cleanups are still possible on top of this, for example the LVDS
border control could be placed in the LVDS encoder structure and updated
based on the result of the panel fitter calculation.

Multi-pipe fitting isn't handled correctly either if we ever get a config
that wants to try the panel fitter on more than one output at a time.

v2: use pipe_config for storing pfit values (Daniel)
    add i9xx_pfit_enable function for use by 9xx and VLV (Daniel)
v3: fixup conflicts and lvds_dither check

[danvet: fix up botched conflict resolution from Jesse:
- border = LVDS_BORDER_ENABLE was lost for CENTER scaling
- comment about gen2/3 panel fitter scaling was lost
- dev_priv->lvds_dither reintroduced.]
