staging: rtl8192u: fix braces in r819xU_phy.c

This patch fixes the brace position and the whitespace
around braces.

That corrects the following checkpatch errors:
ERROR: that open brace { should be on the previous line
ERROR: else should follow close brace '}'
ERROR: space required after that close brace '}'

Also, it removes completely an if(0) statement,
instead of correcting its braces.
