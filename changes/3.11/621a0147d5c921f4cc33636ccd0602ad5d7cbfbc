ARM: 7757/1: mm: don't flush icache in switch_mm with hardware broadcasting

When scheduling an mm on a CPU where it hasn't previously been used, we
flush the icache on that CPU so that any code loaded previously on
a different core can be safely executed.

For cores with hardware broadcasting of cache maintenance operations,
this is clearly unnecessary, since the inner-shareable invalidation in
__sync_icache_dcache will affect all CPUs.

This patch conditionalises the icache flush in switch_mm based on
cache_ops_need_broadcast().
