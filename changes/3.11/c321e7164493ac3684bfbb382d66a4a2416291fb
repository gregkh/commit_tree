ARM: bcm2835: defconfig updates

Enable CONFIG_LEDS_GPIO and all options required to enable it, or make
the option useful.

Enable the simple framebuffer driver, fbconsole, and VT support.

This patch also regenerated bcm2835_defconfig, which removes two HW_RANDOM
entries, since they're enabled by default.
