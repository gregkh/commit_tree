powerpc/eeh: Make eeh_pe_get() public

While processing EEH event interrupt from P7IOC, we need function
to retrieve the PE according to the indicated EEH device. The patch
makes function eeh_pe_get() public so that other source files can call
it for that purpose. Also, the patch fixes referring to wrong BDF
(Bus/Device/Function) address while searching PE in function
__eeh_pe_get().
