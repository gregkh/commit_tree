ARM: mpu: add MPU initialisation for secondary cores

The MPU initialisation on the primary core is performed in two stages, one
minimal stage to ensure the CPU can boot and a second one after
sanity_check_meminfo. As the memory configuration is known by the time we
boot secondary cores only a single step is necessary, provided the values
for DRSR are passed to secondaries.

This patch implements this arrangement. The configuration generated for the
MPU regions is made available to the secondary core, which can then use the
asm MPU intialisation code to program a complete region configuration.

This is necessary for SMP configurations without an MMU, as the MPU
initialisation is the only way to ensure that memory is specified as
'shared'.
