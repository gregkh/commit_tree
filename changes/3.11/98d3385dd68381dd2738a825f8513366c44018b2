staging: comedi: addi_apci_3xxx: separate from addi_common.c

This driver currently uses the addi-data "common" code and contains
a lot of bloat.

Copy the code in addi_common.c to this driver and remove the #include
that caused it to be compiled with the driver. This will allow removing
the bloat.
