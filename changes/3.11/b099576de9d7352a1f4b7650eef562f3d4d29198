ARM: ux500: Correct the EN_3v3 regulator's on/off GPIO

When this node was added, the AB8500 GPIO driver was pretty broken.
As a hack, we pretended that NOMADIK GPIO 26 was the correct on/off
pin, as it was unused. It worked because AB8500 GPIO 26 was in an
'always on from boot' state. Now the AB8500 GPIO driver is working,
the default state for all the pins is 'off'. Let's flip back over to
use the correct GPIO which is _actually_ attached to the regulator.

We're also taking the opportunity to straighten out some formatting
misdemeanours, swapping spaces for tabs.
