ARM: shmobile: Rework sh7372 sleep code to use virt_to_phys()

Instead of having a hard coded virt-to-phys address
conversion code in sleep-sh7372.S, rework the code
to do the conversion in C using virt_to_phys().

This removes the need for PLAT_PHYS_OFFSET which
in turn is needed for ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM.
