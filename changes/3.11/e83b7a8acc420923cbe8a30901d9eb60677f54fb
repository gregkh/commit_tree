mmc: tmio: fix unbalanced power-on calls with clock-gating enabled

With MMC clock gating enabled the MMC core currently calls MMC host driver's
.set_ios() method with .power_mode == MMC_POWER_ON and the clock value set
either to 0 or to the target rate. The tmio MMC driver then wrongly
translates the latter calls to card slot power-on requests, even when the
slot already was on. This patch fixes the driver to avoid needlessly
incrementing power-supplying regulator's use count.
