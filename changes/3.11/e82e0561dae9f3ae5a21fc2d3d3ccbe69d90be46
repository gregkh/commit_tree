mm: vmscan: obey proportional scanning requirements for kswapd

Simplistically, the anon and file LRU lists are scanned proportionally
depending on the value of vm.swappiness although there are other factors
taken into account by get_scan_count().  The patch "mm: vmscan: Limit
the number of pages kswapd reclaims" limits the number of pages kswapd
reclaims but it breaks this proportional scanning and may evenly shrink
anon/file LRUs regardless of vm.swappiness.

This patch preserves the proportional scanning and reclaim.  It does
mean that kswapd will reclaim more than requested but the number of
pages will be related to the high watermark.
