[SCSI] enable destruction of blocked devices which fail LUN scanning

If something goes wrong during LUN scanning, e.g. a transport layer
failure occurs, then __scsi_remove_device() can get invoked by the
LUN scanning code for a SCSI device in state SDEV_CREATED_BLOCK and
before the SCSI device has been added to sysfs (is_visible == 0).
Make sure that even in this case the transition into state SDEV_DEL
occurs. This avoids that __scsi_remove_device() can get invoked a
second time by scsi_forget_host() if this last function is invoked
from another thread than the thread that performs LUN scanning.
