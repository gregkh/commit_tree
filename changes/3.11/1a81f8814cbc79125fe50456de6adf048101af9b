Allow the USB HCD to create Wireless USB root hubs

This patch adds Wireless USB root hub support to the USB HCD.  It allows
the HWA to create its root hub which previously failed because the HCD
treated wireless root hubs the same as USB2 high speed hubs.  The creation
of the root hub would fail in that case due to lack of TTs which wireless
root hubs do not support.
