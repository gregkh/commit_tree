ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: Remove irq entries from mcspi, mmc hwmods

Commit '3b9b10151c6838af52244cec4af41a938bb5b7ec' cleaned up the
data file to remove all irq and dma entries for all hwmods, which
are now populated by DT. But mcspi and mmc irq, dma entries were
retained since MMC, NFS boot was not working. Since it is root caused
to be an issue with only DMA entries [1], irq can be safely removed.
