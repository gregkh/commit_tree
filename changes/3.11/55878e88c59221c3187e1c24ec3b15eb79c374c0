sparsemem: add BUILD_BUG_ON when sizeof mem_section is non-power-of-2

Instead of leaving a hidden trap for the next person who comes along and
wants to add something to mem_section, add a big fat warning about it
needing to be a power-of-2, and insert a BUILD_BUG_ON() in sparse_init()
to catch mistakes.

Right now non-power-of-2 mem_sections cause a number of WARNs at boot
(which don't clearly point to the size of mem_section as an issue), but
the system limps on (temporarily, at least).

This is based upon Dave Hansen's earlier RFC where he ran into the same
issue:
	"sparsemem: fix boot when SECTIONS_PER_ROOT is not power-of-2"
