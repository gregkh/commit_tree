jbd2: fix race in t_outstanding_credits update in jbd2_journal_extend()

jbd2_journal_extend() first checked whether transaction can accept
extending handle with more credits and then added credits to
t_outstanding_credits.  This can race with start_this_handle() adding
another handle to a transaction and thus overbooking a transaction.
Make jbd2_journal_extend() use atomic_add_return() to close the race.
