[CIFS] use sensible file nlink values if unprovided

Certain servers may not set the NumberOfLinks field in query file/path
info responses. In such a case, cifs_inode_needs_reval() assumes that
all regular files are hardlinks and triggers revalidation, leading to
excessive and unnecessary network traffic.

This change hardcodes cf_nlink (and subsequently i_nlink) when not
returned by the server, similar to what already occurs in cifs_mkdir().
