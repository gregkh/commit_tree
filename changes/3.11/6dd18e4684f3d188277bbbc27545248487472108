  of/address: Handle #address-cells > 2 specially

broke real time clock access on Bimini, js2x, and similar powerpc
machines using the "maple" platform. That code was indirectly relying
on the old (broken) behaviour of the translation for the hypertransport
to ISA bridge.

This fixes it by treating hypertransport as a PCI bus
