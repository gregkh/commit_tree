Btrfs: fix lock leak when resuming snapshot deletion

We aren't setting path->locks[level] when we resume a snapshot deletion which
means we won't unlock the buffer when we free the path.  This causes deadlocks
if we happen to re-allocate the block before we've evicted the extent buffer
from cache.  Thanks,
