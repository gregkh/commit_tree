rt2x00: move extra_tx_headroom field from rt2x00_ops to rt2x00_dev

The extra_tx_headroom field of struct rt2x00_ops
indicates the extra TX headroom size required for
a given device. This data is redundant, the value
can be computed from the desc_size and winfo_size
fields of the TX queues.

Move the extra_tx_headroom field to struct rt2x00_dev,
compute its value in the probe routine and use the
cached value in the rest of the code.
