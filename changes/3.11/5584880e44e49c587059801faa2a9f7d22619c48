x86: xen: Sync the wallclock when the system time is set

Currently the Xen wallclock is only updated every 11 minutes if NTP is
synchronized to its clock source (using the sync_cmos_clock() work).
If a guest is started before NTP is synchronized it may see an
incorrect wallclock time.

Use the pvclock_gtod notifier chain to receive a notification when the
system time has changed and update the wallclock to match.

This chain is called on every timer tick and we want to avoid an extra
(expensive) hypercall on every tick.  Because dom0 has historically
never provided a very accurate wallclock and guests do not expect one,
we can do this simply: the wallclock is only updated if the clock was
set.
