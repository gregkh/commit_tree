i2c: designware: fix race between subsequent xfers

The designware block is not always properly disabled in the case of
transfer errors. Interrupts from aborted transfers might be handled
after the data structures for the following transfer are initialised but
before the hardware is set up. This can corrupt the data structures to
the point that the system is stuck in an infinite interrupt loop (where
FIFOs are never emptied because dev->msg_read_idx == dev->msgs_num).

This patch cleanly disables the designware-i2c hardware at the end of
every transfer, be it successful or not.
