pwm: Add Renesas TPU PWM driver

The Timer Pulse Unit (TPU) is a 4-channels 16-bit timer used to generate
waveforms. This driver exposes PWM functions through the PWM API for
other drivers to use.

The code is loosely based on the leds-renesas-tpu driver by Magnus Damm
and the TPU PWM driver shipped in the Armadillo EVA 800 kernel sources.
