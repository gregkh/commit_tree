i2c: i2c-mxs: Use DMA mode even for small transfers

Recently we have been seing some reports about PIO mode not working properly.

Let's use DMA mode even for small transfers.

Without this patch, i2c reads the incorrect sgtl5000 version on a mx28evk when
touchscreen is enabled:

[    5.856270] sgtl5000 0-000a: Device with ID register 0 is not a sgtl5000
[    9.877307] sgtl5000 0-000a: ASoC: failed to probe CODEC -19
[    9.883528] mxs-sgtl5000 sound.12: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -19
[    9.892955] mxs-sgtl5000 sound.12: snd_soc_register_card failed (-19)

[wsa: we have a proper solution for -next, so this non intrusive
solution is OK for now]
