checkpatch: create an EXPERIMENTAL --fix option to correct patches

Some patches have simple defects in whitespace and formatting that
checkpatch could correct automatically.  Attempt to do so.

Add a --fix option to create a "<inputfile>.EXPERIMENTAL-checkpatch-fixes"
file that tries to use normal kernel style for some of these formatting
errors.

Add warnings against using this file without verifying the changes.
