metag: init common clk and use "core" clk

If the common clock framework is enabled, call of_clk_init(NULL) in
time_init() to register device tree clocks with the clock framework.

After this time_init() calls a new function init_metag_clocks(), which
looks for a clock named "core" in the node compatible with "img,meta"
(usually the root node). If found the get_core_freq machine callback is
overridden to obtain the core clock frequency using that clock.
