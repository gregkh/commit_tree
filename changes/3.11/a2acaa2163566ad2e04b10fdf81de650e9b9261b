dmaengine: ste_dma40: Fix up static memcpy event lines

The commit
"dmaengine: ste_dma40: Assign memcpy channels in the driver"
had two problems:
- It assigned magic numbers to the memcpy event lines
  instead of giving them symbolic names.
- It seems to have missed one of the memcpy event lines,
  number 51.

This patch fixes it up.
