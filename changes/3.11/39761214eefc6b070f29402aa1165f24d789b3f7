crypto: crct10dif - Simple correctness and speed test for CRCT10DIF hash

These are simple tests to do sanity check of CRC T10 DIF hash.  The
correctness of the transform can be checked with the command
	modprobe tcrypt mode=47
The speed of the transform can be evaluated with the command
	modprobe tcrypt mode=320

Set the cpu frequency to constant and turn turbo off when running the
speed test so the frequency governor will not tweak the frequency and
affects the measurements.
