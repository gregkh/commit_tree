virtio-net: fix the race between channels setting and refill

Commit 55257d72bd1c51f25106350f4983ec19f62ed1fa (virtio-net: fill only rx queues
which are being used) tries to refill on demand when changing the number of
channels by call try_refill_recv() directly, this may race:

- the refill work who may do the refill in the same time
- the try_refill_recv() called in bh since napi was not disabled

Which may led guest complain during setting channels:

virtio_net virtio0: input.1:id 0 is not a head!

Solve this issue by scheduling a refill work which can guarantee the
serialization of refill.
