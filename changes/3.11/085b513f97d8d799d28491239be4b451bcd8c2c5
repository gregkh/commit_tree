[SCSI] sd: fix crash when UA received on DIF enabled device

sd_prep_fn will allocate a larger CDB for the command via mempool_alloc
for devices using DIF type 2 protection.  This CDB was being freed
in sd_done, which results in a kernel crash if the command is retried
due to a UNIT ATTENTION.  This change moves the code to free the larger
CDB into sd_unprep_fn instead, which is invoked after the request is
complete.

It is no longer necessary to call scsi_print_command separately for
this case as the ->cmnd will no longer be NULL in the normal code path.

Also removed conditional test for DIF type 2 when freeing the larger
CDB because the protection_type could have been changed via sysfs while
the command was executing.
