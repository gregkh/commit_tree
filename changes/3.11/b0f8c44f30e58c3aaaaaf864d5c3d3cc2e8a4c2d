nanosleep: use freezable blocking call

Avoid waking up every thread sleeping in a nanosleep call during
suspend and resume by calling a freezable blocking call.  Previous
patches modified the freezer to avoid sending wakeups to threads
that are blocked in freezable blocking calls.

This call was selected to be converted to a freezable call because
it doesn't hold any locks or release any resources when interrupted
that might be needed by another freezing task or a kernel driver
during suspend, and is a common site where idle userspace tasks are
blocked.
