Revert "drm/i915: Don't use the HDMI port color range bit on Valleyview"

The PIPECONF color range bit doesn't appear to be effective, on HDMI
outputs at least. The color range bit in the port register works though,
so let's use it.

I have not yet verified whether the PIPECONF bit works on DP outputs.

This reverts commit 83a2af88f80ebf8104c9e083b786668b00f5b9ce.
