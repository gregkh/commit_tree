powerpc/hw_brk: Fix setting of length for exact mode breakpoints

The smallest match region for both the DABR and DAWR is 8 bytes, so the
kernel needs to filter matches when users want to look at regions smaller than
this.

Currently we set the length of PPC_BREAKPOINT_MODE_EXACT breakpoints to 8.
This is wrong as in exact mode we should only match on 1 address, hence the
length should be 1.

This ensures that the kernel will filter out any exact mode hardware breakpoint
matches on any addresses other than the requested one.
