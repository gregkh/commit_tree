cgroup: move init_css_set initialization inside cgroup_mutex

cgroup_init() was doing init_css_set initialization outside
cgroup_mutex, which is fine but we want to add lockdep annotation on
subsystem iterations and cgroup_init() will trigger it spuriously.
Move init_css_set initialization inside cgroup_mutex.
