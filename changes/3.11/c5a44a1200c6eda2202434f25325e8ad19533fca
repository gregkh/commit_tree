tracing: Change f_start() to take event_mutex and verify i_private != NULL

trace_format_open() and trace_format_seq_ops are racy, nothing
protects ftrace_event_call from trace_remove_event_call().

Change f_start() to take event_mutex and verify i_private != NULL,
change f_stop() to drop this lock.

This fixes nothing, but now we can change debugfs_remove("format")
callers to nullify ->i_private and fix the the problem.

Note: the usage of event_mutex is sub-optimal but simple, we can
change this later.
