rbd: set removing flag while holding list lock

When unmapping a device, its id is supplied, and that is used to
look up which rbd device should be unmapped.  Looking up the
device involves searching the rbd device list while holding
a spinlock that protects access to that list.

Currently all of this is done under protection of the control lock,
but that protection is going away soon.  To ensure the rbd_dev is
still valid (still on the list) while setting its REMOVING flag, do
so while still holding the list lock.  To do so, get rid of
__rbd_get_dev(), and open code what it did in the one place it
was used.
