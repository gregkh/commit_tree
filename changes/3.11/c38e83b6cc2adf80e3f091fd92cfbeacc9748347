USB: option: append Petatel NP10T device to GSM modems list

This patch was tested on 3.10.1 kernel.

Same models of Petatel NP10T modems have different device IDs.
Unfortunately they have no additional revision information on a board
which may treat them as different devices. Currently I've seen only
two NP10T devices with various IDs. Possibly Petatel NP10T list will
be appended upon devices with new IDs will appear.
