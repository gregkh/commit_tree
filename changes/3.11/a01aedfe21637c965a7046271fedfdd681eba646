GFS2: Reserve journal space for quota change in do_grow

If a GFS2 file system is mounted with quotas and a file is grown
in such a way that its free blocks for the allocation are represented
in a secondary bitmap, GFS2 ran out of blocks in the transaction.
That resulted in "fatal: assertion "tr->tr_num_buf <= tr->tr_blocks".
This patch reserves extra blocks for the quota change so the
transaction has enough space.
