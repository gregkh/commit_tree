ARM: integrator: merge PCIv3 driver into one file

The Integrator/AP PCI bridget, "v3" is contained in two files,
where pci.c is a socket container to plug in the v3 device.
However to transition the v3 to enable device tree probing, it
need to be converted to a platform device (so that it can have
a device node in the device tree) and then we want the PCI
driver in a single file, as any other device driver, so we can
handle variants using compatible strings and device name,
and get the base address etc from resources connected to the
device node.

To move toward this goal we consolidate all code in the
pci_v3.c file.
