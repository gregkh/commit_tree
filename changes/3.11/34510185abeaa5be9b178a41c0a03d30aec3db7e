xfs: don't emit v5 superblock warnings on write

We write the superblock every 30s or so which results in the
verifier being called. Right now that results in this output
every 30s:

XFS (vda): Version 5 superblock detected. This kernel has EXPERIMENTAL support enabled!
Use of these features in this kernel is at your own risk!

And spamming the logs.

We don't need to check for whether we support v5 superblocks or
whether there are feature bits we don't support set as these are
only relevant when we first mount the filesytem. i.e. on superblock
read. Hence for the write verification we can just skip all the
checks (and hence verbose output) altogether.
