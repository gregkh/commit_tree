[SCSI] megaraid_sas: Return DID_ERROR for SCSI IO, when controller is in critical h/w error

Do not return SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY, but send DID_ERROR to SCSI mid-layer, if
adapter is in critical error state.  "SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY" will keep same
SCSI command in loop and it is not a right return value, if controller is
hardware critical error.
