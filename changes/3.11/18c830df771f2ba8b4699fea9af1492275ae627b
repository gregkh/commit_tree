kernel/fork.c:copy_process(): consolidate the lockless CLONE_THREAD checks

copy_process() does a lot of "chaotic" initializations and checks
CLONE_THREAD twice before it takes tasklist.  In particular it sets
"p->group_leader = p" and then changes it again under tasklist if
!thread_group_leader(p).

This looks a bit confusing, lets create a single "if (CLONE_THREAD)" block
which initializes ->exit_signal, ->group_leader, and ->tgid.
