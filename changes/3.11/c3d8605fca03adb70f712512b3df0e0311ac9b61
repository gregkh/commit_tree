staging: comedi: addi_apci_3xxx: absorb apci3xxx_do_insn_bits()

All the boards supported by this driver that have digital outputs use
the same 'do_bits' callback in the boardinfo. Absorb the function from
hwdrv_apci3xxx.c directly into the driver.

Remove the 'do_bits' callback from the boardinfo and use the function
directly to set the subdevice (*insn_bits).

None of the boards supported by this driver have a 'do_config', 'do_write',
or 'do_read' callback. Remove the unnecessary setting of the subdevice
callbacks.
