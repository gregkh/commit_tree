libata: Add atapi_dmadir force flag

Some device require DMADIR to be enabled, but are not detected as such
by atapi_id_dmadir.  One such example is "Asus Serillel 2"
SATA-host-to-PATA-device bridge: the bridge itself requires DMADIR,
even if the bridged device does not.

As atapi_dmadir module parameter can cause problems with some devices
(as per Tejun Heo's memory), enabling it globally may not be possible
depending on the hardware.

This patch adds atapi_dmadir in the form of a "force" horkage value,
allowing global, per-bus and per-device control.
