x86, processor-flags: Fix the datatypes and add bit number defines

The control registers are unsigned long (32 bits on i386, 64 bits on
x86-64), and so make that manifest in the data type for the various
constants.  Add defines with a _BIT suffix which defines the bit
number, as opposed to the bit mask.

This should resolve some issues with ~bitmask that Linus discovered.
