Btrfs: re-add root to dead root list if we stop dropping it

If we stop dropping a root for whatever reason we need to add it back to the
dead root list so that we will re-start the dropping next transaction commit.
The other case this happens is if we recover a drop because we will add a root
without adding it to the fs radix tree, so we can leak it's root and commit root
extent buffer, adding this to the dead root list makes this cleanup happen.
Thanks,
