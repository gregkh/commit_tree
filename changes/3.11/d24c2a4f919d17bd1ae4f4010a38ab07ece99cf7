PM / QoS: correct the valid range of pm_qos_class

The valid start index for pm_qos_array is not 0, but
PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY. There is a null_pm_qos at index 0 of
pm_qos_array.  However, null_pm_qos is not created as misc device so
that inclusion of 0 index for checking pm_qos_class especially for
file operations is not proper here.
