printk: Fix return of braille_register_console()

Some of my configs I test with have CONFIG_A11Y_BRAILLE_CONSOLE set.
When I started testing against v3.11-rc4 my console went bonkers.  Using
ktest to bisect the issue, it came down to:

commit bbeddf52a "printk: move braille console support into separate
braille.[ch] files"

Looking into the patch I found the problem.  It's with the return of
braille_register_console().  As anything other than NULL is considered a
failure.

But for those of us that have CONFIG_A11Y_BRAILLE_CONSOLE set but do not
define a "brl" or "brl=" on the command line, we still may want a
console that those with sight can still use.

Return NULL (success) if "brl" or "brl=" is not on the console line.
