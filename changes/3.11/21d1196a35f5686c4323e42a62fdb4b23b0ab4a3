ipv4: set transport header earlier

commit 45f00f99d6e ("ipv4: tcp: clean up tcp_v4_early_demux()") added a
performance regression for non GRO traffic, basically disabling
IP early demux.

IPv6 stack resets transport header in ip6_rcv() before calling
IP early demux in ip6_rcv_finish(), while IPv4 does this only in
ip_local_deliver_finish(), _after_ IP early demux.

GRO traffic happened to enable IP early demux because transport header
is also set in inet_gro_receive()

Instead of reverting the faulty commit, we can make IPv4/IPv6 behave the
same : transport_header should be set in ip_rcv() instead of
ip_local_deliver_finish()

ip_local_deliver_finish() can also use skb_network_header_len() which is
faster than ip_hdrlen()
