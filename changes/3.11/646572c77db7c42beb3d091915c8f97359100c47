clk: add support for Rockchip gate clocks

This adds basic support for gate-clocks on Rockchip SoCs.
There are 16 gates in each register and use the HIWORD_MASK
mechanism for changing gate settings.

The gate registers form a continuos block which makes the dt node
structure a matter of taste, as either all 160 gates can be put into
one gate clock spanning all registers or they can be divided into
the 10 individual gates containing 16 clocks each.
The code supports both approaches.
