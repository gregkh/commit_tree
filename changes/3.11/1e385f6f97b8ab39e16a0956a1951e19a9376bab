ACPI / processor: move try_offline_node() after acpi_unmap_lsapic()

try_offline_node() checks that all CPUs associated with the given
node have been removed by using cpu_present_bits.  If all cpus
related to that node have been removed, try_offline_node() clears
the node information.

However, try_offline_node() called from acpi_processor_remove() never
clears the node information.  For disabling cpu_present_bits,
acpi_unmap_lsapic() needs be called.  Yet, acpi_unmap_lsapic() is
called after try_offline_node() has run.  So when try_offline_node()
runs, the CPU's cpu_present_bits is always set.

Fix the issue by moving try_offline_node() after acpi_unmap_lsapic().

The problem fixed here was uncovered by commit cecdb19 "ACPI / scan:
Change the implementation of acpi_bus_trim()".
