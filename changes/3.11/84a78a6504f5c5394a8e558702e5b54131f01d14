timer_list: correct the iterator for timer_list

Correct an issue with /proc/timer_list reported by Holger.

When reading from the proc file with a sufficiently small buffer, 2k so
not really that small, there was one could get hung trying to read the
file a chunk at a time.

The timer_list_start function failed to account for the possibility that
the offset was adjusted outside the timer_list_next.
