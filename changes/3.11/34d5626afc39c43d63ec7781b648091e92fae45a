bnx2x: Fix move FP memory deallocations

If driver will fail to allocate all queues, it will shrink the number of
queues and move the storage queue to its correct place (i.e., the last
queue among the newly supported number).

When changing the pointers of the new location of the FCoE queue, we need
to pay special attention to the aggregations pointer - that memory is allocated
during probe and released upon driver removal. Current implementation has 2
pointers pointing to the same chunk of allocated memory, meaning upon removal
there will be two kfree() of the same chunk while the other won't be released.
