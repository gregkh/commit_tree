ASoC: omap-pcm: Request the DMA channel differently when DT is involved

When booting with DT the platform_get_resource_byname() is not available to
get the DMA resource. In this case the DAI drivers will set the filter_data to
the name of the DMA and omap-pcm can use this to request the DMA channel.
