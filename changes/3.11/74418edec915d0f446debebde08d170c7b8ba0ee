cfg80211: fix P2P GO interface teardown

When a P2P GO interface goes down, cfg80211 doesn't properly
tear it down, leading to warnings later. Add the GO interface
type to the enumeration to tear it down like AP interfaces.
Otherwise, we leave it pending and mac80211's state can get
very confused, leading to warnings later.
