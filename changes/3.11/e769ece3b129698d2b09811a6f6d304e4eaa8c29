KVM: s390: fix pfmf non-quiescing control handling

Fix the test within handle_pfmf() if the host has the NQ key-setting
facility installed.
Right now the code would incorrectly generate a program check in the
guest if the NQ control bit for a pfmf request was set and if the host
has the NQ key-setting facility installed.
