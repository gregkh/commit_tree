[SCSI] isci: Fix a race condition in the SSP task management path

This commit fixes a race condition in the isci driver abort task and SSP
device task management path.  The race is caused when an I/O termination
in the SCU hardware is necessary because of an SSP target timeout condition,
and the check of the I/O end state races against the HW-termination-driven
end state.  The failure of the race meant that no TMF was sent to the device
to clean-up the pending I/O.
