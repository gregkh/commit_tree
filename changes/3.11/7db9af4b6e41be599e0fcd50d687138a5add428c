pinctrl: add function to parse generic pinconfig properties from a dt node

pinconf_generic_parse_dt_config() takes a node as input and generates an
array of generic pinconfig values from the properties of this node.

As I couldn't find a mechanism to count the number of properties of a node
the function uses internally an array to accept one of parameter and copies
the real present options to a smaller variable at its end.
