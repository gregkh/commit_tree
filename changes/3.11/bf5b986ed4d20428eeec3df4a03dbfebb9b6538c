sched/tg: Use 'unsigned long' for load variable in task group

Since tg->load_avg is smaller than tg->load_weight, we don't need a
atomic64_t variable for load_avg in 32 bit machine.
The same reason for cfs_rq->tg_load_contrib.

The atomic_long_t/unsigned long variable type are more efficient and
convenience for them.
