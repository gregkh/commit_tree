regulator: tps62360: Fix crash in i2c_driver .probe

Commit "i2c: core: make it possible to match a pure device tree driver"
changed semantics of the i2c probing for device tree devices.
Device tree probed devices now get a NULL i2c_device_id pointer.
This caused kernel panics due to NULL dereference.
