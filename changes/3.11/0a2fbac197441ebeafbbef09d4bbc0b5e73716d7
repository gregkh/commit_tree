net: sctp: decouple cleaning some socket data from endpoint

Rather instead of having the endpoint clean the garbage from the
socket, use a sk_destruct handler sctp_destruct_sock(), that does
the job for that when there are no more references on the socket.
At least do this for our crypto transform through crypto_free_hash()
that is allocated when in listening state.

Also, perform sctp_put_port() only when sk is valid. At a later
point in time we can still determine if there's an option of
placing this into sk_prot->unhash() or sctp_endpoint_free() without
any races. For now, leave it in sctp_endpoint_destroy() though.
