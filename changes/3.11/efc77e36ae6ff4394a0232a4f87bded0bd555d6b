ASoC: dapm: Add snd_soc_dapm_switch to the power up/down sequence table

The power up/down sequence order for DAPM switch widgets is not explicitly
initialized, causing them to be run always as the first widget type for both
power up and down. Move it to the same position in the sequence as other mixer
widget types.
