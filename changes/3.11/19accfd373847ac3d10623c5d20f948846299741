ARM: move vector stubs

Move the machine vector stubs into the page above the vector page,
which we can prevent from being visible to userspace.  Also move
the reset stub, and place the swi vector at a location that the
'ldr' can get to it.

This hides pointers into the kernel which could give valuable
information to attackers, and reduces the number of exploitable
instructions at a fixed address.
