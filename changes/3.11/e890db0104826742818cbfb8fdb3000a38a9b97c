NFSv4: Fix the sync mount option for nfs4 mounts

The sync mount option stopped working for NFSv4 mounts after commit
c02d7adf8c5429727a98bad1d039bccad4c61c50 (NFSv4: Replace nfs4_path_walk() with
FS path lookup in a private namespace).  If MS_SYNCHRONOUS is set in the
super_block that we're cloning from, then it should be set in the new
super_block as well.
