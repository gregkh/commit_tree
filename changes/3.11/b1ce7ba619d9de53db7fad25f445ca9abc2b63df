ALSA: usb-audio: claim autodetected PCM interfaces all at once

snd_card_register() registers all devices newly added since the last
call.  However, the playback/capture streams are handled as one ALSA
device, so the second /dev device will not be registered if the PCM
streams are added in two steps.

QUIRK_AUTODETECT caused the probe callback to be called once for each
interface, which triggered this problem.  Work around this by handling
this like the composite quirk, i.e., autodetecting all other interfaces
that might be used for PCM or MIDI.
