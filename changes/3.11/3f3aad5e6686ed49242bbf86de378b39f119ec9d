xen-blkback: implement LRU mechanism for persistent grants

This mechanism allows blkback to change the number of grants
persistently mapped at run time.

The algorithm uses a simple LRU mechanism that removes (if needed) the
persistent grants that have not been used since the last LRU run, or
if all grants have been used it removes the first grants in the list
(that are not in use).

The algorithm allows the user to change the maximum number of
persistent grants, by changing max_persistent_grants in sysfs.

Since we are storing the persistent grants used inside the request
struct (to be able to mark them as "unused" when unmapping), we no
longer need the bitmap (unmap_seg).
