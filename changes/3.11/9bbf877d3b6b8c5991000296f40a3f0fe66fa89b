irqdomain: Replace LEGACY mapping with LINEAR

The LEGACY mapping unnecessarily complicates the irqdomain code and
can easily be implemented with a linear mapping.  By ripping it out
and replacing it with the LINEAR mapping the object size of
irqdomain.c shrinks by about 330 bytes (ARMv7) which offsets the
additional allocation required by the linear map.  It also makes it
possible for current LEGACY map users to pre-allocate irq_descs for a
subset of the hwirqs and dynamically allocate the rest as needed.
