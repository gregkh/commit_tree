drm/i915: Break up the large vsnprintf() in print_error_buffers()

So it appears that I have encountered some bogosity when trying to call
i915_error_printf() with many arguments from print_error_buffers(). The
symptom is that the vsnprintf parser tries to interpret an integer arg
as a character string, the resulting OOPS indicating stack corruption.
Replacing the single call with its 13 format specifiers and arguments
with multiple calls to i915_error_printf() worked fine. This patch goes
one step further and introduced i915_error_puts() to pass the strings
simply.

It may not fix the root cause, but it does prevent my box from dying and
I think helps make print_error_buffers() more friendly.
