ARM: 7807/1: kexec: validate CPU hotplug support

Architectures should fully validate whether kexec is possible as part of
machine_kexec_prepare(), so that user-space's kexec_load() operation can
report any problems. Performing validation in machine_kexec() itself is
too late, since it is not allowed to return.

Prior to this patch, ARM's machine_kexec() was testing after-the-fact
whether machine_kexec_prepare() was able to disable all but one CPU.
Instead, modify machine_kexec_prepare() to validate all conditions
necessary for machine_kexec_prepare()'s to succeed. BUG if the validation
succeeded, yet disabling the CPUs didn't actually work.
