tracing: Fix reset of time stamps during trace_clock changes

Fixed two issues with changing the timestamp clock with trace_clock:

 - The global buffer was reset on instance clock changes. Change this to pass
   the correct per-instance buffer
 - ftrace_now() is used to set buf->time_start in tracing_reset_online_cpus().
   This was incorrect because ftrace_now() used the global buffer's clock to
   return the current time. Change this to use buffer_ftrace_now() which
   returns the current time for the correct per-instance buffer.

Also removed tracing_reset_current() because it is not used anywhere
