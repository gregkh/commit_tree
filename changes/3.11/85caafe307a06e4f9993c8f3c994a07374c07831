IB/qib: Optimize CQ callbacks

The current workqueue implemention has the following performance
deficiencies on QDR HCAs:

- The CQ call backs tend to run on the CPUs processing the
  receive queues
- The single thread queue isn't optimal for multiple HCAs

This patch adds a dedicated per HCA bound thread to process CQ callbacks.
