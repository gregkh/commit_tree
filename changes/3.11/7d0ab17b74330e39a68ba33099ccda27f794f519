tipc: convert configuration server to use new server facility

As the new socket-based TIPC server infrastructure has been
introduced, we can now convert the configuration server to use
it.  Then we can take future steps to simplify the configuration
server locking policy.

Some minor reordering of initialization is done, due to the
dependency on having tipc_socket_init completed.
