nilfs2: implement calculation of free inodes count

Currently, NILFS2 returns 0 as free inodes count (f_ffree) and current
used inodes count as total file nodes in file system (f_files):

df -i
Filesystem      Inodes  IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/loop0           2      2       0  100% /mnt/nilfs2

This patch implements real calculation of free inodes count.  First of
all, it is calculated total file nodes in file system as
(desc_blocks_count * groups_per_desc_block * entries_per_group).  Then, it
is calculated free inodes count as difference the total file nodes and
used inodes count.  As a result, we have such output for NILFS2:

df -i
Filesystem       Inodes   IUsed    IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/loop0      4194304 2114701  2079603   51% /mnt/nilfs2
