[media] drxk_hard: Remove most 80-cols checkpatch warnings

X-Patchwork-Delegate: mchehab@redhat.com
There are a few cases where breaking the code into separate
lines make it worse to read. However, on several places,
breaking it to make checkpatch.pl happier is OK and improves
code readability.
So, break longer lines where that won't cause harm.
