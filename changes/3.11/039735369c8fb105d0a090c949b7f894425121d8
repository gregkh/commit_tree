drm: Fix drm_rect documentation

The 'struct' keyword was missing so struct drm_rect documentation never
ended up in the generated docs.

Also move the drm_rect documentations to a new section alognside the
various helper functions and add a short description about the intended
purpose of drm_rect.

v2: Move to new section and add general description
