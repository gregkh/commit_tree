ARM: ux500: enable the crypto and hash on all dbx500

"ARM: ux500: Add Device Tree nodes for the ux500 Crypt device"
"ARM: ux500: Add Device Tree nodes for the ux500 Hash device"

Added the crypto and hash devices conditionally, i.e. so as to
be turned on per-board by setting an "status" property on the
device from "disabled" to "okay" on each device.

This is wrong since this is an SoC feature, it is not board
dependent. It is the same ASIC under all circumstances and
functionality does not vary with board family.

This moves the enablement into the SoC file.
