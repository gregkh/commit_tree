HID: wiimote: add MP quirks

Devices which have built-in motion plus ports don't need MP detection
logic. The new WIIMOD_BUILTIN_MP modules sets the WIIPROTO_FLAG_BUILTIN_MP
flag which disables polling for MP.

Some other devices erroneously report that they support motion-plus. For
these devices and all devices without extension ports, we load
WIIMOD_NO_MP which sets WIIPROTO_FLAG_NO_MP. This effectively disables all
MP detection logic.
