clk: mvebu: add more PCIe clocks for Armada XP

The current revision of the datasheet only mentions the gatable clocks
for the PCIe 0.0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 interfaces, and forgot to mention
the ones for the PCIe 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 and 3.0
interfaces. After confirmation with Marvell engineers, this patch adds
the missing gatable clocks for those PCIe interfaces.

It also changes the name of the previously existing PCIe gatable
clocks, in order to match the naming using the datasheets.
