ARM: i.MX6: add i.MX6 specific L2 cache configuration

To improve the performance and power consumption add an i.MX6
specific L2 cache initialization.

This configuration is taken from Freescale's kernel patch

"ENGR00153601 [MX6]Adjust L2 cache parameter" [1]

with two additional improvements:

a) The L2X0_POWER_CTRL has only the two bits we set. So no need
   to read the register before. Remove the register read done
   in Freescale's patch.

b) In the L2X0_PREFETCH_CTRL register, besides the double linefill (bit[30]),
   additionally enable the instruction and data prefetch (bit[29-28]).
