iwlwifi: reverse DATA/INST section order

As the new MVM firmware files package the DATA section
first, and debugfs files want to access the DATA and
not INST section, reverse the order here. This is only
relevant for debugfs code that accesses the SRAM DATA
section and uses this constant to access the section.
