powerpc/eeh: Remove eeh_mutex

Originally, eeh_mutex was introduced to protect the PE hierarchy
tree and the attached EEH devices because EEH core was possiblly
running with multiple threads to access the PE hierarchy tree.
However, we now have only one kthread in EEH core. So we needn't
the eeh_mutex and just remove it.
