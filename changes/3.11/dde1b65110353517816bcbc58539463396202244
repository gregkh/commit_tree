ARM: mm: correct pte_same behaviour for LPAE.

For 3 levels of paging the PTE_EXT_NG bit will be set for user
address ptes that are written to a page table but not for ptes
created with mk_pte.

This can cause some comparison tests made by pte_same to fail
spuriously and lead to other problems.

To correct this behaviour, we mask off PTE_EXT_NG for any pte that
is present before running the comparison.
