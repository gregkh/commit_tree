ARM: OMAP3EVM: Marking omap3_evm_display_init() with CONFIG_BROKEN

On 37xx EVM non-dt boot fails with current mainline,
because of broken GPIO numbering in the board file
that uses hardcoded GPIOs.

So marking omap3_evm_display_init() with CONFIG_BROKEN
for now as suggested by Tony as per the below link:
