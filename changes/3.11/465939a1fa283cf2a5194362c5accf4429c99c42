memcg: don't need to free memcg via RCU or workqueue

Now memcg has the same life cycle with its corresponding cgroup, and a
cgroup is freed via RCU and then mem_cgroup_css_free() will be called in
a work function, so we can simply call __mem_cgroup_free() in
mem_cgroup_css_free().

This actually reverts commit 59927fb984d ("memcg: free mem_cgroup by RCU
to fix oops").
