clocksource: Always verify highres capability

If a clocksource has a (wrong) high rating, but can't be used as a
timebase for oneshot tick mode, it is unconditionally selected even
when the system is already in oneshot tick mode. This causes full
system failure.

Verify the clocksource selection against the oneshot mode.
