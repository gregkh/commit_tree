drm/i915: propagate errors from intel_dp_init_connector

In case we detect a "ghost eDP", intel_edp_init_connector frees both
the connector and encoder and then returns. On Haswell, intel_ddi_init
then tries to use the freed encoder on the HDMI initialization path
since the following commit:

    drm/i915: don't setup hdmi for port D edp in ddi_init

So now on intel_ddi_init we check for the "ghost eDP" case and return
without trying to initialize HDMI. This way we won't try to read the
freed "intel_encoder" struct in the next "if" statement.
