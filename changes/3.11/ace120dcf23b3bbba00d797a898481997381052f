Thermal: Fix lockup of cpu_down()

Commit f1a18a105 "Thermal: CPU Package temperature thermal" had code
that did a get_online_cpus(), run a loop and then do a
put_online_cpus(). The problem is that the loop had an error exit that
would skip the put_online_cpus() part.

In the error exit part of the function, it also did a get_online_cpus(),
run a loop and then put_online_cpus(). The only way to get to the error
exit part is with get_online_cpus() already performed. If this error
condition is hit, the system will be prevented from taking CPUs offline.
The process taking the CPU offline will lock up hard.

Removing the get_online_cpus() removes the lockup as the hotplug CPU
refcount is back to zero.

This was bisected with ktest.
