sched: Optimize build_sched_domains() for saving first SD node for a cpu

We are saving first scheduling domain for a cpu in build_sched_domains() by
iterating over the nested sd->child list. We don't actually need to do it this
way.

tl will be equal to sched_domain_topology for the first iteration and so we can
set *per_cpu_ptr(d.sd, i) based on that.  So, save pointer to first SD while
running the iteration loop over tl's.
