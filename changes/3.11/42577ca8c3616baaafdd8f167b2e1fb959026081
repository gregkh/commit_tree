Fix __wait_on_atomic_t() to call the action func if the counter != 0

rather than if the counter is 0 so as to be analogous to __wait_on_bit().

Thanks to Yacine who found this by visual inspection.

This will affect FS-Cache in that it will could fail to sleep correctly when
trying to clean up after a netfs cookie is withdrawn.
