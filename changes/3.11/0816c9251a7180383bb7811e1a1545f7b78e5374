[SCSI] Allow error handling timeout to be specified

Introduce eh_timeout which can be used for error handling purposes. This
was previously hardcoded to 10 seconds in the SCSI error handling
code. However, for some fast-fail scenarios it is necessary to be able
to tune this as it can take several iterations (bus device, target, bus,
controller) before we give up.
