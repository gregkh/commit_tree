ARC: [plat-arcfpga] Fix build breakage when !CONFIG_ARC_SERIAL

This fixes the following:
- CONFIG_ARC_SERIAL_BAUD is only defined when CONFIG_SERIAL_ARC is defined.
  Make sure that it isn't referenced otherwise.
- There is no use for initializing arc_uart_info[] when CONFIG_SERIAL_ARC is
  not defined.
