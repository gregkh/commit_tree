s390/appldata_net_sum: do not use static data

Using static data for fields which are accessed by HW will fail if
the driver is build as a module (since this would be vmalloc'ed
memory). This Bug was revealed via
"s390: remove virt_to_phys implementation" - the old virt_to_phys
implementation would have translated the address but it was not
guaranteed that the memory was contiguous.
