ARM: nommu: define dummy TLB operations for nommu configurations

nommu platforms do not perform address translation and therefore clearly
don't have TLBs. However, some SMP code assumes the presence of the TLB
flushing routines and will therefore fail to compile for a nommu system.

This patch defines dummy local_* TLB operations and #defines
tlb_ops_need_broadcast() as 0, therefore causing the usual ARM SMP TLB
operations to call the local variants instead.
