xen-block: implement indirect descriptors

Indirect descriptors introduce a new block operation
(BLKIF_OP_INDIRECT) that passes grant references instead of segments
in the request. This grant references are filled with arrays of
blkif_request_segment_aligned, this way we can send more segments in a
request.

The proposed implementation sets the maximum number of indirect grefs
(frames filled with blkif_request_segment_aligned) to 256 in the
backend and 32 in the frontend. The value in the frontend has been
chosen experimentally, and the backend value has been set to a sane
value that allows expanding the maximum number of indirect descriptors
in the frontend if needed.

The migration code has changed from the previous implementation, in
which we simply remapped the segments on the shared ring. Now the
maximum number of segments allowed in a request can change depending
on the backend, so we have to requeue all the requests in the ring and
in the queue and split the bios in them if they are bigger than the
new maximum number of segments.

[v2: Fixed minor comments by Konrad.
[v1: Added padding to make the indirect request 64bit aligned.
 Added some BUGs, comments; fixed number of indirect pages in
 blkif_get_x86_{32/64}_req. Added description about the indirect operation
 in blkif.h]
