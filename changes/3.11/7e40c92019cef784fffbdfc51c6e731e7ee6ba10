perf tools: fix a typo of a Power7 event name

In the Power7 PMU guide:
https://www.power.org/documentation/commonly-used-metrics-for-performance-analysis/
PM_BRU_MPRED is referred to as PM_BR_MPRED.

It fixed the typo by changing the name of the event in kernel and
documentation accordingly.

This patch changes the ABI, there are some reasons I think it's ok:

- It is relatively new interface, specific to the Power7 platform.

- No tools that we know of actually use this interface at this point
 (none are listed near the interface).

- Users of this interface (eg oprofile users migrating to perf)
  would be more used to the "PM_BR_MPRED" rather than "PM_BRU_MPRED".

- These are in the ABI/testing at this point rather than ABI/stable,
  so hoping we have some wiggle room.
