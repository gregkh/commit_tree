virtio_balloon: leak_balloon(): only tell host if we got pages deflated

balloon_page_dequeue() can return NULL.  If it does for the first page
being freed then leak_balloon() will create a scatter list with len=0.
Which in turn seems to generate an invalid virtio request.

I didn't get this in practice, I found it by code review.  On the other
hand, such an invalid virtio request will cause errors in QEMU and
fill_balloon() also performs the same check implemented by this commit.

This bug was introduced in e2250429.
