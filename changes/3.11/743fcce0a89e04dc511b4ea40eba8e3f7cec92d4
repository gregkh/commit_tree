ehci-platform: add pre_setup() method to platform data

Sometimes there is a need  to initialize some non-standard registers mapped to
the EHCI region before accessing the standard EHCI registers.  Add pre_setup()
method with 'struct usb_hcd *' parameter to be called just before ehci_setup()
to the 'ehci-platform'  driver's platform data for this purpose...

While at it, add the missing incomplete declaration of 'struct platform_device'
to <linux/usb/ehci_pdriver.h>...

The patch has been tested on the Marzen and BOCK-W boards.
