tg3: Simplify tg3_phy_eee_config_ok() by reusing tg3_eee_pull_config()

eee_config_ok() was checking only for mismatch in advertised settings.
This patch expands the scope of eee_config_ok() to check for mismatch in
the other eee settings. On mismatch we will require a call to
tg3_setup_eee() to push the configured settings to the hardware.
