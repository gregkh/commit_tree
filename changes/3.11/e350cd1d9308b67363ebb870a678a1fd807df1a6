rapidio/switches: remove tsi500 driver

Remove the driver for Tsi500 Parallel RapidIO switch because this device
has not been available for several years.  Since the first introduction of
Tsi500, the parallel RapidIO interface was replaced by the serial RapidIO
(sRIO) and therefore there is no value in keeping this driver.
