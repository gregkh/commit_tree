xen-blkfront: use a different scatterlist for each request

In blkif_queue_request blkfront iterates over the scatterlist in order
to set the segments of the request, and in blkif_completion blkfront
iterates over the raw request, which makes it hard to know the exact
position of the source and destination memory positions.

This can be solved by allocating a scatterlist for each request, that
will be keep until the request is finished, allowing us to copy the
data back to the original memory without having to iterate over the
raw request.
