[media] wl128x: do not call copy_to_user() while holding spinlocks

copy_to_user() must not be called with spinlocks held, but it is in
fmc_transfer_rds_from_internal_buff().
The patch copies data to tmpbuf, releases spinlock and then passes it to userspace.
By the way there is a small unification: replace a couple of hardcoded constants by a macro.
