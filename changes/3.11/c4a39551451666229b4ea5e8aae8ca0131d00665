MD: Remember the last sync operation that was performed

MD:  Remember the last sync operation that was performed

This patch adds a field to the mddev structure to track the last
sync operation that was performed.  This is especially useful when
it comes to what is recorded in mismatch_cnt in sysfs.  If the
last operation was "data-check", then it reports the number of
descrepancies found by the user-initiated check.  If it was a
"repair" operation, then it is reporting the number of
descrepancies repaired.  etc.
