GFS2: Add atomic_open support

I've restricted atomic_open to only operate on regular files, although
I still don't understand why atomic_open should not be possible also for
directories on GFS2. That can always be added in later though, if it
makes sense.

The ->atomic_open function can be passed negative dentries, which
in most cases means either ENOENT (->lookup) or a call to d_instantiate
(->create). In the GFS2 case though, we need to actually perform the
look up, since we do not know whether there has been a new inode created
on another node. The look up calls d_splice_alias which then tries to
rehash the dentry - so the solution here is to simply check for that
in d_splice_alias. The same issue is likely to affect any other cluster
filesystem implementing ->atomic_open
