ARM: AM33XX: hwmod data: irq, dma and addr info clean up

AM33XX only supports DT boot mode and with addition of
extracting module resources like, irq, dma and address space
from DT block, so now we can remove duplicate information from
hwmod data file.

This patch cleanups-up/deletes,

     - All references to "omap_hwmod_irq_info" data.
     - All references to "omap_hwmod_dma_info" data.
     - References to "omap_hwmod_addr_space" of the modules
       for which DT node is available with required address
       space information.
     - For the modules where "sysc" field is not applicable,
       we don't need module address space, so remove them as well.
     - The hwmod like firewall etc which are not useful are also
       deleted.

This cleanup gets us around ~1100 LOC of negative diff.
Patch is boot tested on AM335x-EVM along with below modules -
	- Matrix-keypad
	- Volume up/down keys
	- Ethernet
	- RTC
	- WDT
