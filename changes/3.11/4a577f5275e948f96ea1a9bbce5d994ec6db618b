spi: coldfire-qspi: fix error return code in mcfqspi_probe()

If pdev->dev.platform_data is not set, mcfqspi_probe() will return 0
and release all the resources, in this case, we should return a error
code instead of 0.
This patch fix to return -ENOENT in this case and move the check for
pdev->dev.platform_data to the begin of this function.
