xen-blkback: allocate list of pending reqs in small chunks

Allocate pending requests in smaller chunks instead of allocating them
all at the same time.

This change also removes the global array of pending_reqs, it is no
longer necessay.

Variables related to the grant mapping have been grouped into a struct
called "grant_page", this allows to allocate them in smaller chunks,
and also improves memory locality.
