net_sched: restore "linklayer atm" handling

commit 56b765b79 ("htb: improved accuracy at high rates")
broke the "linklayer atm" handling.

 tc class add ... htb rate X ceil Y linklayer atm

The linklayer setting is implemented by modifying the rate table
which is send to the kernel.  No direct parameter were
transferred to the kernel indicating the linklayer setting.

The commit 56b765b79 ("htb: improved accuracy at high rates")
removed the use of the rate table system.

To keep compatible with older iproute2 utils, this patch detects
the linklayer by parsing the rate table.  It also supports future
versions of iproute2 to send this linklayer parameter to the
kernel directly. This is done by using the __reserved field in
struct tc_ratespec, to convey the choosen linklayer option, but
only using the lower 4 bits of this field.

Linklayer detection is limited to speeds below 100Mbit/s, because
at high rates the rtab is gets too inaccurate, so bad that
several fields contain the same values, this resembling the ATM
detect.  Fields even start to contain "0" time to send, e.g. at
1000Mbit/s sending a 96 bytes packet cost "0", thus the rtab have
been more broken than we first realized.
