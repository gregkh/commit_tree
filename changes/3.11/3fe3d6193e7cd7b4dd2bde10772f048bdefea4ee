tracing/kprobes: Kill probe_enable_lock

enable_trace_probe() and disable_trace_probe() should not worry about
serialization, the caller (perf_trace_init or __ftrace_set_clr_event)
holds event_mutex.

They are also called by kprobe_trace_self_tests_init(), but this __init
function can't race with itself or trace_events.c

And note that this code depended on event_mutex even before 41a7dd420c
which introduced probe_enable_lock. In fact it assumes that the caller
kprobe_register() can never race with itself. Otherwise, say, tp->flags
manipulations are racy.
