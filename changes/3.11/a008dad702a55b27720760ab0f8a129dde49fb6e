    ARM: at91: Consolidate time keeping and irq enable

    Enable core cpuidle timekeeping and irq enabling and remove that
    handling from this code.

introduced an additional zero to the state1 (suspend) target residency.

With a periodic tick, the cpu never enters the state1 with both 10000 and
100000.

With a tickless system, it enters to state1 much more often with the
initial value, roughly x7 more.

Fix it by setting the value to 10ms again.
