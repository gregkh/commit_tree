mm: sched: numa: fix NUMA balancing when !SCHED_DEBUG

Commit 3105b86a9fee ("mm: sched: numa: Control enabling and disabling of
NUMA balancing if !SCHED_DEBUG") defined numabalancing_enabled to
control the enabling and disabling of automatic NUMA balancing, but it
is never used.

I believe the intention was to use this in place of sched_feat_numa(NUMA).

Currently, if SCHED_DEBUG is not defined, sched_feat_numa(NUMA) will
never be changed from the initial "false".
