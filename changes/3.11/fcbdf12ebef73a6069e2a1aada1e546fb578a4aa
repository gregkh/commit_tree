usb: gadget: f_phonet: convert to new function interface with backward compatibility

Converting f_phonet to the new function interface requires converting
the f_phonet's function code and its users.

This patch converts the f_phonet.c to the new function interface.

The file is now compiled into a separate usb_f_phonet.ko module.

The old function interface is provided by means of preprocessor
conditional directives. After all users are converted, the old interface
can be removed.
