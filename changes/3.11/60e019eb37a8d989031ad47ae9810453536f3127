x86: Get rid of ->hard_math and all the FPU asm fu

Reimplement FPU detection code in C and drop old, not-so-recommended
detection method in asm. Move all the relevant stuff into i387.c where
it conceptually belongs. Finally drop cpuinfo_x86.hard_math.

[ hpa: huge thanks to Borislav for taking my original concept patch
  and productizing it ]

[ Boris, note to self: do not use static_cpu_has before alternatives! ]
