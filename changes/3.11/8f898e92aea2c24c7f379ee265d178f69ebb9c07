ALSA: usb-audio: store protocol version in struct audioformat

Instead of reading bInterfaceProtocol from the descriptor whenever it's
needed, store this value in the audioformat structure.  Besides
simplifying some code, this will allow us to correctly handle vendor-
specific devices where the descriptors are marked with other values.
