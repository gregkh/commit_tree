powerpc/eeh: I/O chip EEH enable option

The patch adds the backend to enable or disable EEH functionality
for the specified PE. The backend is also used to enable MMIO or
DMA path for the problematic PE. It's notable that all PEs on
PowerNV platform support EEH functionality by default, and we
disallow to disable EEH for the specific PE.
