bcache: Use standard utility code

Some of bcache's utility code has made it into the rest of the kernel,
so drop the bcache versions.

Bcache used to have a workaround for allocating from a bio set under
generic_make_request() (if you allocated more than once, the bios you
already allocated would get stuck on current->bio_list when you
submitted, and you'd risk deadlock) - bcache would mask out __GFP_WAIT
when allocating bios under generic_make_request() so that allocation
could fail and it could retry from workqueue. But bio_alloc_bioset() has
a workaround now, so we can drop this hack and the associated error
handling.
