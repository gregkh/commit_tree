ARM: 7815/1: kexec: offline non panic CPUs on Kdump panic

In case of normal kexec kernel load, all cpu's are offlined
before calling machine_kexec().But in case crash panic cpus
are relaxed in machine_crash_nonpanic_core() SMP function
but not offlined.

When crash kernel is loaded with kexec and on panic trigger
machine_kexec() checks for number of cpus online.
If more than one cpu is online machine_kexec() fails to load
with below error

kexec: error: multiple CPUs still online

In machine_crash_nonpanic_core() SMP function, offline CPU
before cpu_relax
