[media] saa7115: Add register setup and config for gm7113c

The gm7113c chip is similar to the original saa7113 chip, so I try to
re-use most of the saa7113 specific setup-/configuration registers.
According to the datasheet, the gm7113c chip has not implemented
any register-addresses after 0x1f, so I add a new entry to for the chip
to the saa711x_has_reg function.
The devices I've seen using this chip will fail to get stable video-sync
if these registers are not zeroed:
	R_14_ANAL_ADC_COMPAT_CNTL
	R_15_VGATE_START_FID_CHG
	R_16_VGATE_STOP
	R_17_MISC_VGATE_CONF_AND_MSB
The saa711x_set_v4lstd is updated to send a simpler configuration-table
to avoid setting these registers.
