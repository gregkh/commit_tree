rbd: use rwsem to protect header updates

Updating an image header needs to be protected to ensure it's
done consistently.  However distinct headers can be updated
concurrently without a problem.  Instead of using the global
control lock to serialize headder updates, just rely on the header
semaphore.  (It's already used, this just moves it out to cover
a broader section of the code.)

That leaves the control mutex protecting only the creation of rbd
clients, so rename it.
