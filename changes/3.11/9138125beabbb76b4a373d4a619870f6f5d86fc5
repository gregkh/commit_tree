blk-throttle: implement proper hierarchy support

With the recent updates, blk-throttle is finally ready for proper
hierarchy support.  Dispatching now honors service_queue->parent_sq
and propagates correctly.  The only thing missing is setting
->parent_sq correctly so that throtl_grp hierarchy matches the cgroup
hierarchy.

This patch updates throtl_pd_init() such that service_queues form the
same hierarchy as the cgroup hierarchy if sane_behavior is enabled.
As this concludes proper hierarchy support for blkcg, the shameful
.broken_hierarchy tag is removed from blkio_subsys.

v2: Updated blkio-controller.txt as suggested by Vivek.
