ARM: at91/DT: at91sam9x5ek: fix USB host property to enable port C

Device Tree "num-ports" property of USB host node has to be
set to maximum number of ports available.
The possibility to activate a particular port is done by specifying the proper
gpio configuration for its vbus.

This patch fixes the USB host node by configuring the 3 ports available on the
product and letting "port A" available for USB gadget usage.
