staging: ft1000: fix memory leak on error path in ft1000_probe()

ft1000dev->tx_urb and ft1000dev->rx_urb are not deallocated
if something goes wrong in ft1000_probe(). Also there is no
check for success of urb allocation. The patch fixes the both issues.

By the way, there is no sense in GFP_ATOMIC for urb allocation here,
so it is changed to GFP_KERNEL.
