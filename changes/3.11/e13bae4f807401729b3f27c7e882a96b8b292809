mac80211: fix ethtool stats for non-station interfaces

As reported in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60514,
the station loop never initialises 'sinfo' and therefore adds up
a stack values, leaking stack information (the number of times it
adds values is easily obtained another way.)

Fix this by initialising the sinfo for each station to add.
