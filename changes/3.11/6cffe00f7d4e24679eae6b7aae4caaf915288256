alarmtimer: Add functions for timerfd support

Add functions needed for hooking up alarmtimer to timerfd:

* alarm_restart: Similar to hrtimer_restart, restart an alarmtimer after
  the expires time has already been updated (as with alarm_forward).

* alarm_forward_now: Similar to hrtimer_forward_now, move the expires
  time forward to an interval from the current time of the associated clock.

* alarm_start_relative: Start an alarmtimer with an expires time relative to
  the current time of the associated clock.

* alarm_expires_remaining: Similar to hrtimer_expires_remaining, return the
  amount of time remaining until alarm expiry.
