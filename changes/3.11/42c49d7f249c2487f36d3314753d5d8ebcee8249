xfs: fix sgid inheritance for subdirectories inheriting default acls [V3]

XFS removes sgid bits of subdirectories under a directory containing a default
acl.

When a default acl is set, it implies xfs to call xfs_setattr_nonsize() in its
code path. Such function is shared among mkdir and chmod system calls, and
does some checks unneeded by mkdir (calling inode_change_ok()). Such checks
remove sgid bit from the inode after it has been granted.

With this patch, we extend the meaning of XFS_ATTR_NOACL flag to avoid these
checks when acls are being inherited (thanks hch).

Also, xfs_setattr_mode, doesn't need to re-check for group id and capabilities
permissions, this only implies in another try to remove sgid bit from the
directories. Such check is already done either on inode_change_ok() or
xfs_setattr_nonsize().

Changelog:

V2: Extends the meaning of XFS_ATTR_NOACL instead of wrap the tests into another
    function

V3: Remove S_ISDIR check in xfs_setattr_nonsize() from the patch
