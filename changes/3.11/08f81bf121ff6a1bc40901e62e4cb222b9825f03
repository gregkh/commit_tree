staging: comedi: pcl730: clean up the register map documentation

This driver supports a number of simple digital i/o boards with
slight variations in the register map. Clean up the comment about
the register map to better document the driver.

Remove the #define's used for the registers since thet don't apply
to all the board variations supported by the driver.
