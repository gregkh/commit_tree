locks: convert fl_link to a hlist_node

Testing has shown that iterating over the blocked_list for deadlock
detection turns out to be a bottleneck. In order to alleviate that,
begin the process of turning it into a hashtable. We start by turning
the fl_link into a hlist_node and the global lists into hlists. A later
patch will do the conversion of the blocked_list to a hashtable.
