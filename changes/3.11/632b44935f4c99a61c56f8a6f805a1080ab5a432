blk-throttle: remove deferred config application mechanism

When bps or iops configuration changes, blk-throttle records the new
configuration and sets a flag indicating that the config has changed.
The flag is checked in the bio dispatch path and applied.  This
deferred config application was necessary due to limitations in blkcg
framework, which haven't existed for quite a while now.

This patch removes the deferred config application mechanism and
applies new configurations directly from tg_set_conf(), which is
simpler.

v2: Dropped unnecessary throtl_schedule_delayed_work() call from
    tg_set_conf() as suggested by Vivek Goyal.
