packet: nlmon: virtual netlink monitoring device for packet sockets

Currently, there is no good possibility to debug netlink traffic that
is being exchanged between kernel and user space. Therefore, this patch
implements a netlink virtual device, so that netlink messages will be
made visible to PF_PACKET sockets. Once there was an approach with a
similar idea [1], but it got forgotten somehow.

I think it makes most sense to accept the "overhead" of an extra netlink
net device over implementing the same functionality from PF_PACKET
sockets once again into netlink sockets. We have BPF filters that can
already be easily applied which even have netlink extensions, we have
RX_RING zero-copy between kernel- and user space that can be reused,
and much more features. So instead of re-implementing all of this, we
simply pass the skb to a given PF_PACKET socket for further analysis.

Another nice benefit that comes from that is that no code needs to be
changed in user space packet analyzers (maybe adding a dissector, but
not more), thus out of the box, we can already capture pcap files of
netlink traffic to debug/troubleshoot netlink problems.

Also thanks goes to Thomas Graf, Flavio Leitner, Jesper Dangaard Brouer.
