staging: csr: Fix obvious logic error in staging/csr

In uf_process_ma_packet_req() (staging/csr/unifi_pdu_processing.c), the
test for
(staInfo->timSet != CSR_WIFI_TIM_RESET) || (staInfo->timSet !=
CSR_WIFI_TIM_RESETTING)
obviously makes no sense and causes GCC to emit a warning if
-Wlogical-op is enabled.
As suggested in the referenced bug report, || was replaced by &&.
