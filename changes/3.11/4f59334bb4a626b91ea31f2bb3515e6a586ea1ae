iwlwifi: fix initialisation while RF-kill is asserted

If RF-kill is asserted while a device is initialized, the
firmware INIT image can now be run to retrieve the NVM
data and register to mac80211 properly. Previously, the
initialisation would fail in this scenario and the driver
wouldn't register with mac80211 at all, making the device
unusable.
