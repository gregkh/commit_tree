video: ssd1307fb: Speed up the communication with the controller

The code until now was sending only 1pixel-wide page segment at once,
and started a new transfer every time. It has proven very inefficient,
because for one byte to display on the screen, we had to actually send 3
bytes over I2C: the address, the type of data that was going to the
controller, and then the actual data.

This patches changes that by sending a whole page at once, avoiding most
of this expensive overhead.
