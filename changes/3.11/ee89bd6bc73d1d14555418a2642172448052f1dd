lib: Move fonts from drivers/video/console/ to lib/fonts/

Several drivers need font support independent of CONFIG_VT, cfr. commit
9cbce8d7e1dae0744ca4f68d62aa7de18196b6f4, "console/font: Refactor font
support code selection logic").
Hence move the fonts and their support logic from drivers/video/console/ to
its own library directory lib/fonts/.
This also allows to limit processing of drivers/video/console/Makefile to
CONFIG_VT=y again.
