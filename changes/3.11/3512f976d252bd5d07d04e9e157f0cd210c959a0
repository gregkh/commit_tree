drm: Add struct drm_rect and assorted utility functions

struct drm_rect represents a simple rectangle. The utility
functions are there to help driver writers.

v2: Moved the region stuff into its own file, made the smaller funcs
    static inline, used 64bit maths in the scaled clipping function to
    avoid overflows (instead it will saturate to INT_MIN or INT_MAX).
v3: Renamed drm_region to drm_rect, drm_region_clip to
    drm_rect_intersect, and drm_region_subsample to drm_rect_downscale.
v4: Renamed some function parameters, improve kernel-doc comments a bit,
    and actually generate documentation for drm_rect.[ch].
v5: s/RETUTRNS/RETURNS/
