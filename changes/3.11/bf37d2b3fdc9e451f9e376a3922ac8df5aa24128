busy_poll: cleanup do-nothing placeholders

When renaming ll_poll to busy poll, I introduced a typo
in the name of the do-nothing placeholder for sk_busy_loop
and called it sk_busy_poll.
This broke compile when busy poll was not configured.
Cong Wang submitted a patch to fixed that.
This patch removes the now redundant, misspelled placeholder.
