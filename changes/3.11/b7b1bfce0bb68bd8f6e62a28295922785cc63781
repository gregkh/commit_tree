ipv6: split duplicate address detection and router solicitation timer

This patch splits the timers for duplicate address detection and router
solicitations apart. The router solicitations timer goes into inet6_dev
and the dad timer stays in inet6_ifaddr.

The reason behind this patch is to reduce the number of unneeded router
solicitations send out by the host if additional link-local addresses
are created. Currently we send out RS for every link-local address on
an interface.

If the RS timer fires we pick a source address with ipv6_get_lladdr. This
change could hurt people adding additional link-local addresses and
specifying these addresses in the radvd clients section because we
no longer guarantee that we use every ll address as source address in
router solicitations.
