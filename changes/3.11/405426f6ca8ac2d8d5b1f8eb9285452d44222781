net: sctp: sctp_sf_do_prm_asoc: do SCTP_CMD_INIT_CHOOSE_TRANSPORT first

While this currently cannot trigger any NULL pointer dereference in
sctp_seq_dump_local_addrs(), better change the order of commands to
prevent a future bug to happen. Although we first add SCTP_CMD_NEW_ASOC
and then set the SCTP_CMD_INIT_CHOOSE_TRANSPORT, it is okay for now,
since this primitive is only called by sctp_connect() or sctp_sendmsg()
with sctp_assoc_add_peer() set first. However, lets do this precaution
and first set the transport and then add it to the association hashlist
to prevent in future something to possibly triggering this.
