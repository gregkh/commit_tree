ARM: 7819/1: fiq: Cast the first argument of flush_icache_range()

Commit 2ba85e7af4 (ARM: Fix FIQ code on VIVT CPUs) causes the following build warning:

arch/arm/kernel/fiq.c:92:3: warning: passing argument 1 of 'cpu_cache.coherent_kern_range' makes integer from pointer without a cast [enabled by default]

Cast it as '(unsigned long)base' to avoid the warning.
