powerpc: Rename and flesh out the facility unavailable exception handler

The exception at 0xf60 is not the TM (Transactional Memory) unavailable
exception, it is the "Facility Unavailable Exception", rename it as
such.

Flesh out the handler to acknowledge the fact that it can be called for
many reasons, one of which is TM being unavailable.

Use STD_EXCEPTION_COMMON() for the exception body, for some reason we
had it open-coded, I've checked the generated code is identical.
