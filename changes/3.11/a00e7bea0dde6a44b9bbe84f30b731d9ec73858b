powerpc: disable assert_pte_locked for collapse_huge_page

With THP we set pmd to none, before we do pte_clear. Hence we can't
walk page table to get the pte lock ptr and verify whether it is locked.
THP do take pte lock before calling pte_clear. So we don't change the locking
rules here. It is that we can't use page table walking to check whether
pte locks are held with THP.
