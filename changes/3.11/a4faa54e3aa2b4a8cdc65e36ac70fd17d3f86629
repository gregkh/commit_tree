USB: EHCI: tegra: remove all power management

The PM routines in ehci-tegra.c use APIs such as ehci_reset(),
ehci_halt(), and ehci_tdi_reset() that would need to be exported to
convert ehci-tegra.c into a separate module from ehci-hcd.c. However,
we'd prefer not to export them.

Instead, simply remove all power management functionality. Runtime PM
was disabled since it didn't work correctly, and system suspend isn't
yet supported in a meaningful way. So, this change doesn't lose any
functionality.

Hopefully the power management logic can be reimplemented in a cleaner
way in the future.
