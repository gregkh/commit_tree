staging: comedi: usbduxfast: rename usbduxfastsub_s variables

For aesthetic reasons, globally rename the variables used for the
struct usbduxfastsub_s * in this driver to 'devpriv'. This variable
pointes to the comedi_device private data.

Also, rename the struct to 'usbduxfast_private' to make its use
a bit clearer.
