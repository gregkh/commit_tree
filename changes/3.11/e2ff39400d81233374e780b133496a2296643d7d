ACPI / memhotplug: Bind removable memory blocks to ACPI device nodes

During ACPI memory hotplug configuration bind memory blocks residing
in modules removable through the standard ACPI mechanism to struct
acpi_device objects associated with ACPI namespace objects
representing those modules.  Accordingly, unbind those memory blocks
from the struct acpi_device objects when the memory modules in
question are being removed.

When "offline" operation for devices representing memory blocks is
introduced, this will allow the ACPI core's device hot-remove code to
use it to carry out remove_memory() for those memory blocks and check
the results of that before it actually removes the modules holding
them from the system.

Since walk_memory_range() is used for accessing all memory blocks
corresponding to a given ACPI namespace object, it is exported from
memory_hotplug.c so that the code in acpi_memhotplug.c can use it.
