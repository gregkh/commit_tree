tipc: set sk_err correctly when connection fails

Should a connect fail, if the publication/server is unavailable or
due to some other error, a positive value will be returned and errno
is never set. If the application code checks for an explicit zero
return from connect (success) or a negative return (failure), it
will not catch the error and subsequent send() calls will fail as
shown from the strace snippet below.

socket(0x1e /* PF_??? */, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0) = 3
connect(3, {sa_family=0x1e /* AF_??? */, sa_data="\2\1\322\4\0\0\322\4\0\0\0\0\0\0"}, 16) = 111
sendto(3, "test", 4, 0, NULL, 0)        = -1 EPIPE (Broken pipe)

The reason for this behaviour is that TIPC wrongly inverts error
codes set in sk_err.
