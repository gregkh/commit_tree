ARM: OMAP: rx51: change musb mode to OTG

Peripheral-only mode got broken in v3.11-rc1 because of unknown reasons.
Change the mode to OTG, in practice that should work equally well even
when/if the regression gets fixed.

Note that the peripheral-only regression is a separate patch, this change
is still correct as the role is handled by hardware.
