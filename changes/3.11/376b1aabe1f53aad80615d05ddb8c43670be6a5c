macvtap: eliminate linear search

Linear search were used in both get_slot() and macvtap_get_queue(), this is
because:

- macvtap didn't reshuffle the array of taps when create or destroy a queue, so
  when adding a new queue, macvtap must do linear search to find a location for
  the new queue. This will also complicate the TUNSETQUEUE implementation for
  multiqueue API.
- the queue itself didn't track the queue index, so the we must do a linear
  search in the array to find the location of a existed queue.

The solution is straightforward: reshuffle the array and introduce a queue_index
to macvtap_queue.
