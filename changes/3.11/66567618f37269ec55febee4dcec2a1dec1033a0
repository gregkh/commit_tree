ARM: select CPU_CPU15_MMU/MPU appropriately

Currently CPU_V7 selects CPU_CP15_MMU, however in the case of a V7 CPU
implementing the PMSA, such as the Cortex-R7, the CP15_MMU operations are
not available. Selecting CPU_CP15_MPU is appropriate in this case.

This patch makes CPU_CP15_MMU dependent on the use of the MMU, selecting
CPU_CP15_MPU for v7 processors when !MMU is chosen.
