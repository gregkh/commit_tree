n_tty: Fix unsafe update of available buffer space

receive_room is used to control the amount of data the flip
buffer work can push to the read buffer. This update is unsafe:

  CPU 0                        |  CPU 1
                               |
                               | n_tty_read()
                               |   n_tty_set_room()
                               |     left = <calc of space>
n_tty_receive_buf()            |
  <push data to buffer>        |
  n_tty_set_room()             |
    left = <calc of space>     |
    tty->receive_room = left   |
                               |     tty->receive_room = left

receive_room is now updated with a stale calculation of the
available buffer space, and the subsequent work loop will likely
overwrite unread data in the input buffer.

Update receive_room atomically with the calculation of the
available buffer space.
