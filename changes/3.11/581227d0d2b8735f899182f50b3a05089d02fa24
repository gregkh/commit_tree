Btrfs: remove the time check in btrfs_commit_transaction()

We checked the commit time to avoid committing the transaction
frequently, but it is unnecessary because:
- It made the transaction commit spend more time, and delayed the
  operation of the external writers(TRANS_START/TRANS_USERSPACE).
- Except the space that we have to commit transaction, such as
  snapshot creation, btrfs doesn't commit the transaction on its
  own initiative.
