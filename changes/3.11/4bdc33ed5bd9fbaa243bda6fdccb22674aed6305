NFSDv4.2: Add NFS v4.2 support to the NFS server

This enables NFSv4.2 support for the server. To enable this
code do the following:
  echo "+4.2" >/proc/fs/nfsd/versions

after the nfsd kernel module is loaded.

On its own this does nothing except allow the server to respond to
compounds with minorversion set to 2.  All the new NFSv4.2 features are
optional, so this is perfectly legal.
