drm/i915: avoid big kmallocs on reading error state

Sometimes when user is trying to get error state out from
debugfs after gpu hang, the memory is low and/or fragmented
enough that kmalloc in seq_file will fail.

Prevent big kmalloc by avoiding seq_file and instead convert
error state to string in smaller chunks.

v2: better alloc flags, better truncate, correct
locking, and error handling improvements (Chris Wilson)

v3: printf annotations (Daniel Vetter)
