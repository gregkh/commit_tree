[media] coda: per-product list of codecs instead of list of formats

This patch adds a list of supported codecs per device type which is used to
determine the allowed pixel formats and maximum frame sizes depending on the
possible codecs. It allows frame sizes larger than 720 x 576 on CODA7 and adds
support for the YVU420 (planar YUV 4:2:0 with switched Cb and Cr) format.
Other uncompressed formats that could be added in the future are the chroma
interleaved NV12 and NV21 formats and the multiplanar variants YUV420M,
YVU420M, NV12M, and NV21M.
Further, rawstreamon is renamed to streamon_out and compstreamon is renamed
to streamon_cap in preparation for decoding support. The maximum encoded
frame buffer size is increased to 1 MiB.
Instead of tracking inst_type and codec across S_FMT calls, set the codec
and inst_type in start_streaming.
