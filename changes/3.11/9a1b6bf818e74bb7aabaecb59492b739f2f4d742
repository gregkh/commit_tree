LOCKD: Don't call utsname()->nodename from nlmclnt_setlockargs

Firstly, nlmclnt_setlockargs can be called from a reclaimer thread, in
which case we're in entirely the wrong namespace.

Secondly, commit 8aac62706adaaf0fab02c4327761561c8bda9448 (move
exit_task_namespaces() outside of exit_notify()) now means that
exit_task_work() is called after exit_task_namespaces(), which
triggers an Oops when we're freeing up the locks.

Fix this by ensuring that we initialise the nlm_host's rpc_client at mount
time, so that the cl_nodename field is initialised to the value of
utsname()->nodename that the net namespace uses. Then replace the
lockd callers of utsname()->nodename.
