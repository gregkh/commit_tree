ARM: 7784/1: mm: ensure SMP alternates assemble to exactly 4 bytes with Thumb-2

Commit ae8a8b9553bd ("ARM: 7691/1: mm: kill unused TLB_CAN_READ_FROM_L1_CACHE
and use ALT_SMP instead") added early function returns for page table
cache flushing operations on ARMv7 SMP CPUs.

Unfortunately, when targetting Thumb-2, these `mov pc, lr' sequences
assemble to 2 bytes which can lead to corruption of the instruction
stream after code patching.

This patch fixes the alternates to use wide (32-bit) instructions for
Thumb-2, therefore ensuring that the patching code works correctly.
