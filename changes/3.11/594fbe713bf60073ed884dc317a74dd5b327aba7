Add support for GMT G762/G763 PWM fan controllers

GMT G762/763 fan speed PWM controller is connected directly to a fan
and performs closed-loop or open-loop control of the fan speed. Two
modes - PWM or DC - are supported by the chip. Introduced driver
provides various knobs to control the operations of the chip (via
sysfs interface). Specific characteristics of the system can be passed
either using board init code or via DT. Documentation for both the
driver and DT bindings are also provided.
