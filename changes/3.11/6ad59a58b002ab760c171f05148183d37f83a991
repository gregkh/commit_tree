metag: add <dt-bindings/> symlink

Add symlink to include/dt-bindings from arch/metag/boot/dts/include/ to
match the one in arch/arm/... (see the commit below) so that
preprocessed device tree files can include various useful constant
definitions.

Commit c58299aa87544a590c62bda0bf52b69fa56cb8d5 ("kbuild: create an
"include chroot" for DT bindings") merged in v3.10-rc1.
