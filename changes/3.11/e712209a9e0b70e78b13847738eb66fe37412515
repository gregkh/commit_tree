perf: Fix hypervisor branch sampling permission check

Commit 2b923c8 perf/x86: Check branch sampling priv level in generic code
was missing the check for the hypervisor (HV) priv level, so add it back.

With this patch, we get the following correct behavior:

  # echo 2 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

  $ perf record -j any,k noploop 1
  Error:
  You may not have permission to collect stats.
  Consider tweaking /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid:
   -1 - Not paranoid at all
    0 - Disallow raw tracepoint access for unpriv
    1 - Disallow cpu events for unpriv
    2 - Disallow kernel profiling for unpriv

   $ perf record -j any,hv noploop 1
   Error:
