kernel/resource.c: remove the unneeded assignment in function __find_resource

This line was introduced by fcb11918 ("resources: add arch hook for
preventing allocation in reserved areas").  But the struct tmp was already
assigned to *new in the above line, so this seems superfluous.  Just
remove it.
