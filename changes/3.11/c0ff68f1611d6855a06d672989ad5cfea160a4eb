kbuild: fix make headers_install when path is too long

If headers_install is executed from a deep/long directory structure, the
shell's maximum argument length can be execeeded, which breaks the operation
with:

| make[2]: execvp: /bin/sh: Argument list too long
| make[2]: ***

Instead of passing each files name with the entire path, I give only the file
name without the source path and give this path as a new argument to
headers_install.pl.

Because there is three possible paths, I have tree input-files list, one per
path.
