ocfs2: submit disk heartbeat bio using WRITE_SYNC

Under heavy I/O load, writing the disk heartbeat can be forced to wait for
minutes, and this causes the node to be fenced.

This patch tries to use WRITE_SYNC in submitting the heartbeat bio, so
that writing the heartbeat will have a priority over other requests.
