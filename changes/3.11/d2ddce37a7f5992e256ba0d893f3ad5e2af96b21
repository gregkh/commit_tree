USB: usbtmc: usbtmc_read sends multiple TMC header based on rigol_quirk

These patches implement a modification of the USBTMC
protocol to allow operation with Rigol equipment. The usbtmc_read function is
modified so if the quirk is active, the TMC header is sent with the size of
the data as the whole size of the request. If the quirk is inactive, the TMC
request is sent once per bulk transfer and with size limited to the bulk
transfer size. In the case of the quirk, only the first response contains the
TMC header and the others are just data.
