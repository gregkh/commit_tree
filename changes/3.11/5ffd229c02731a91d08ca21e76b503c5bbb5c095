powerpc/vfio: Implement IOMMU driver for VFIO

VFIO implements platform independent stuff such as
a PCI driver, BAR access (via read/write on a file descriptor
or direct mapping when possible) and IRQ signaling.

The platform dependent part includes IOMMU initialization
and handling.  This implements an IOMMU driver for VFIO
which does mapping/unmapping pages for the guest IO and
provides information about DMA window (required by a POWER
guest).
