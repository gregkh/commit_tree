ACPICA: Add several repairs for _CST predefined name

Sort list based on the C-state, remove invalid/zero entries.
ACPICA BZ 890. Lv Zheng.

Fixes these possible problems with the _CST object:
 1. Sort the list ascending by C state type.
 2. Ensure type cannot be zero.
 3. A sub-package count of zero means _CST is meaningless.
 4. Count must match the number of C state sub-packages.
