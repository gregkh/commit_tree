regmap: rbtree: Use range information to allocate nodes

If range information has been provided then when we allocate a rbnode
within a range allocate the entire range. The goal is to minimise the
number of reallocations done when combining or extending blocks. At
present only readability and yes_ranges are taken into account, this is
expected to cover most cases efficiently.
