arm64: mm: don't treat user cache maintenance faults as writes

On arm64, cache maintenance faults appear as data aborts with the CM
bit set in the ESR. The WnR bit, usually used to distinguish between
faulting loads and stores, always reads as 1 and (slightly confusingly)
the instructions are treated as reads by the architecture.

This patch fixes our fault handling code to treat cache maintenance
faults in the same way as loads.
