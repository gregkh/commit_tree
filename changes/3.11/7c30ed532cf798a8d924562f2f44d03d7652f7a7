cpufreq: make sure frequency transitions are serialized

Whenever we are changing frequency of a cpu, we are calling PRECHANGE and
POSTCHANGE notifiers. They must be serialized. i.e. PRECHANGE or POSTCHANGE
shouldn't be called twice contiguously.

This can happen due to bugs in users of __cpufreq_driver_target() or actual
cpufreq drivers who are sending these notifiers.

This patch adds some protection against this. Now, we keep track of the last
transaction and see if something went wrong.
