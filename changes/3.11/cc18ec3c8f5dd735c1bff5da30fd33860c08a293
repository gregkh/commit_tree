Use ecryptfs_dentry_to_lower_path in a couple of places

There are two places in ecryptfs that benefit from using
ecryptfs_dentry_to_lower_path() instead of separate calls to
ecryptfs_dentry_to_lower() and ecryptfs_dentry_to_lower_mnt().  Both
sites use fewer instructions and less stack (determined by examining
objdump output).
