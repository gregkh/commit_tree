ext4: Fix fsync error handling after filesystem abort

If filesystem was aborted after inode's write back is complete
but before its metadata was updated we may return success
results in data loss.
In order to handle fs abort correctly we have to check
fs state once we discover that it is in MS_RDONLY state
