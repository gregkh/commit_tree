mm: honor min_free_kbytes set by user

min_free_kbytes is updated during memory hotplug (by
init_per_zone_wmark_min) currently which is right thing to do in most
cases but this could be unexpected if admin increased the value to
prevent from allocation failures and the new min_free_kbytes would be
decreased as a result of memory hotadd.

This patch saves the user defined value and allows updating
min_free_kbytes only if it is higher than the saved one.

A warning is printed when the new value is ignored.
