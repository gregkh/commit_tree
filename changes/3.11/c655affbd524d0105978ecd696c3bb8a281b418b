ACPI / cpufreq: Add ACPI processor device IDs to acpi-cpufreq

After commit ac212b6 (ACPI / processor: Use common hotplug
infrastructure) the acpi-cpufreq module is not loaded automatically
by udev which fails to match it against the x86cpu modalias.  Still,
it can be matched against ACPI processor device IDs, which even
makes more sense, because it depends on the ACPI processor driver
that uses those device IDs to bind to processor devices.

For this reason, add ACPI processor device IDs to acpi-cpufreq.
