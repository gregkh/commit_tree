net: rename low latency sockets functions to busy poll

Rename functions in include/net/ll_poll.h to busy wait.
Clarify documentation about expected power use increase.
Rename POLL_LL to POLL_BUSY_LOOP.
Add need_resched() testing to poll/select busy loops.

Note, that in select and poll can_busy_poll is dynamic and is
updated continuously to reflect the existence of supported
sockets with valid queue information.
