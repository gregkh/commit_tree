cgroup: s/for_each_subsys()/for_each_root_subsys()/

for_each_subsys() walks over subsystems attached to a hierarchy and
we're gonna add iterators which walk over all available subsystems.
Rename for_each_subsys() to for_each_root_subsys() so that it's more
appropriately named and for_each_subsys() can be used to iterate all
subsystems.

While at it, remove unnecessary underbar prefix from macro arguments,
put them inside parentheses, and adjust indentation for the two
for_each_*() macros.

This patch is purely cosmetic.
