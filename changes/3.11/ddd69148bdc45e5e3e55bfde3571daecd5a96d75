cgroup: drop unnecessary RCU dancing from __put_css_set()

__put_css_set() does RCU read access on @cgrp across dropping
@cgrp->count so that it can continue accessing @cgrp even if the count
reached zero and destruction of the cgroup commenced.  Given that both
sides - __css_put() and cgroup_destroy_locked() - are cold paths, this
is unnecessary.  Just making cgroup_destroy_locked() grab css_set_lock
while checking @cgrp->count is enough.

Remove the RCU read locking from __put_css_set() and make
cgroup_destroy_locked() read-lock css_set_lock when checking
@cgrp->count.  This will also allow removing @cgrp->count.
