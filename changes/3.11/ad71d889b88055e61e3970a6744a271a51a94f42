tracing: Add function probe to trigger a ftrace dump to console

Add the "dump" command to have the ftrace buffer dumped to console if
a function is hit. This is useful when debugging a tripple fault,
where you have an idea of a function that is called just before the
tripple fault occurs, and can tell ftrace to dump its content out
to the console before it continues.

Format is:

  <function>:dump

echo 'bad_address:dump' > /debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter

To remove this:

echo '!bad_address:dump' > /debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
