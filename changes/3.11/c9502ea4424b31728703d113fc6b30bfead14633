bcache: Fix a sysfs splat on shutdown

If we stopped a bcache device when we were already detaching (or
something like that), bcache_device_unlink() would try to remove a
symlink from sysfs that was already gone because the bcache dev kobject
had already been removed from sysfs.

So keep track of whether we've removed stuff from sysfs.
