uio/uio_pci_generic: Use module_pci_driver to register driver

Removing some boilerplate by using module_pci_driver instead of calling
register and unregister in the otherwise empty init/exit functions.

It removes a pr_info showing some details about the driver, but
these infos can also be retrieved by using modinfo.

The name of the pci_driver struct had to be changed in order to prevent a
build failure.
