ARM: OMAP1: Remove duplicated DMA channel definitions

Similarly than with OMAP2 there are many DMA channel definitions that have
been moved or redefined in drivers using them and we can remove them from
dma.h.

There is exception with MMC that arch/arm/mach-omap1/devices.c is using
MMC DMA channel definitions for setting platform data but those can be well
replaced with numeric values.

Remove dma.h include from arch/arm/mach-omap1/devices.c and use a script
below for dropping duplicated definitions and for replacing definitions
with DMA channel numbers.

grep '#define OMAP_DMA' arch/arm/mach-omap1/dma.h | while read -r i; do \
		DDEF=`echo $i |cut -d ' ' -f 1-2`; \
		DEF=`echo $DDEF |cut -d ' ' -f 2`; \
		CH=`echo $i |cut -d ' ' -f 3`; \
		if [ `git grep -c "$DDEF" |wc -l` -gt 1 ]; then \
			echo "removing" $DEF; \
			sed -i "s/${DEF}/${CH}/" arch/arm/mach-omap1/devices.c; \
			sed -i "/${DDEF}/d" arch/arm/mach-omap1/dma.h; \
		fi; \
	done
