KVM: VMX: mark unusable segment as nonpresent

Some userspaces do not preserve unusable property. Since usable
segment has to be present according to VMX spec we can use present
property to amend userspace bug by making unusable segment always
nonpresent. vmx_segment_access_rights() already marks nonpresent segment
as unusable.
