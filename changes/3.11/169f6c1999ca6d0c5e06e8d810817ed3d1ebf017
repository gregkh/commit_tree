mm/page_alloc: don't re-init pageset in zone_pcp_update()

When memory hotplug is triggered, we call pageset_init() on
per-cpu-pagesets which both contain pages and are in use, causing both the
leakage of those pages and (potentially) bad behaviour if a page is
allocated from a pageset while it is being cleared.

Avoid this by factoring out pageset_set_high_and_batch() (which contains
all needed logic too set a pageset's ->high and ->batch inrespective of
system state) from zone_pageset_init() and using the new
pageset_set_high_and_batch() instead of zone_pageset_init() in
zone_pcp_update().
