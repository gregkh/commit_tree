cfg80211: fix potential deadlock regression

My big locking cleanups caused a problem by registering the
rfkill instance with the RTNL held, while the callback also
acquires the RTNL. This potentially causes a deadlock since
the two locks used (rfkill mutex and RTNL) can be acquired
in two different orders. Fix this by (un)registering rfkill
without holding the RTNL. This needs to be done after the
device struct is registered, but that can also be done w/o
holding the RTNL.
