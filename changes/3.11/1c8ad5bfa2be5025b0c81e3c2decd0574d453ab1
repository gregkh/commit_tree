bridge: use the bridge IP addr as source addr for querier

Quote from Adam:
"If it is believed that the use of 0.0.0.0
as the IP address is what is causing strange behaviour on other devices
then is there a good reason that a bridge rather than a router shouldn't
be the active querier? If not then using the bridge IP address and
having the querier enabled by default may be a reasonable solution
(provided that our querier obeys the election rules and shuts up if it
sees a query from a lower IP address that isn't 0.0.0.0). Just because a
device is the elected querier for IGMP doesn't appear to mean it is
required to perform any other routing functions."

And introduce a new troggle for it, as suggested by Herbert.
