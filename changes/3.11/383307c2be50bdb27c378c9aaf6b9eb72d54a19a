ARM: ux500: Add a VQMMC (level-shifting) regulator DT node for Snowball

Until recently platform code took care of all MMCI level-shifting by
way of an ios_handler() call-back. Now it is the driver's responsibility
to handle. In order to so that we need to provide the VQMMC regulator
reference in Device Tree. This patch takes care of that.
