drm/i915: add haswell_update_sprite_wm

On Haswell, whenever we change the sprites we need to completely
recalculate all the watermarks, because the sprites are one of the
parameters to the LP watermarks, so a change on the sprites may
trigger a change on which LP levels are enabled.

So on this commit we store all the parameters we need to store for
proper recalculation of the Haswell WMs and then call
haswell_update_wm.

Notice that for now our haswell_update_wm function is not really using
these parameters we're storing, but on the next commits we'll use
these parameters.
