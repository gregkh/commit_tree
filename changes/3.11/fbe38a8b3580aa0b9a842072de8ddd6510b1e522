staging: comedi: usbduxfast: consolidate the firmware upload

Absorb the usbduxfastsub_stop(), usbduxfastsub_upload(), and
usbduxfastsub_start() functions into usbduxfast_upload_firmware().

Each of them just do a usb_control_msg() to the device and output
an error message if it fails. A similar message is also output by
usbduxfast_upload_firmware() so the extra messages are redundant.

We can also share the malloc'ed local buffer needed for the
usb_control_msg().
