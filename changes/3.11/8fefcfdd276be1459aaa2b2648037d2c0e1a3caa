USB: EHCI: tegra: Fix oops in error cleanup

Under some circumstances it happens that the connected PHY can't be
powered up properly, in which case the cleanup path currently crashes
because it checks the tegra->transceiver field using !IS_ERR(), which
will succeed because it is in fact NULL. Dereferencing that pointer
causes an oops in tegra_ehci_probe().

This patch fixes the issue by adding an additional label into the
cleanup path to separately take down the PHY and the transceiver.
