ext4: better estimate credits needed for ext4_da_writepages()

We limit the number of blocks written in a single loop of
ext4_da_writepages() to 64 when inode uses indirect blocks.  That is
unnecessary as credit estimates for mapping logically continguous run
of blocks is rather low even for inode with indirect blocks.  So just
lift this limitation and properly calculate the number of necessary
credits.

This better credit estimate will also later allow us to always write
at least a single page in one iteration.
