ALSA: hda - Add In-driver connection info

Pin's connection list may change dynamically with hot-plug event
on Intel Haswell chip. Users would see connections be "0" in codec#.
when play audio on this pin, software driver choose converter from cache
connections. So add "In-driver connection" info to avoid confuse when
raw connections are different with cache connection.
