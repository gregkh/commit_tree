ext4: add WARN_ON to check the length of allocated blocks

In commit 921f266b: ext4: add self-testing infrastructure to do a
sanity check, some sanity checks were added in map_blocks to make sure
'retval == map->m_len'.

Enable these checks by default and report any assertion failures using
ext4_warning() and WARN_ON() since they can help us to figure out some
bugs that are otherwise hard to hit.
