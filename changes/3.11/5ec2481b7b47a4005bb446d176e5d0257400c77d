hrtimers: Move SMP function call to thread context

smp_call_function_* must not be called from softirq context.

But clock_was_set() which calls on_each_cpu() is called from softirq
context to implement a delayed clock_was_set() for the timer interrupt
handler. Though that almost never gets invoked. A recent change in the
resume code uses the softirq based delayed clock_was_set to support
Xens resume mechanism.

linux-next contains a new warning which warns if smp_call_function_*
is called from softirq context which gets triggered by that Xen
change.

Fix this by moving the delayed clock_was_set() call to a work context.
