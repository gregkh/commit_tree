remoteproc: free carveout memories only after unmapping them

It is not preferable to have the allocated pages for carveout
memories freed before they are unmapped. The code that deals
with the cleanup of carveout memories is therefore moved after
the corresponding mapping entries were cleaned up.

This is mostly a no-op since the remote processors are already
stopped when the cleanup function is called, but this will make
the cleanup code follow the exact reverse path of allocation.
