mmc: core: Fixup Oops for SDIO shutdown

Commit "mmc: core: Handle card shutdown from mmc_bus" introduced an
Oops in the shutdown sequence for SDIO.

The drv pointer, does not exist for SDIO since the probing of the SDIO
card from the mmc_bus perspective is expected to fail by returning
-ENODEV.

This patch adds the proper check for the pointer before calling it.
