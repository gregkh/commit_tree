ARM: msm: Prepare clk_get() users in mach-msm for clock-pcom driver

In the near future we'll be moving clock-pcom to a platform
driver, in which case these two users of clk_get() in mach-msm
need to be updated. Have board-trout-panel.c make the proc_comm
call directly so that we don't have to port this board specific
code to the driver right now and reorder the initcall order of
dma.c so that it initializes after the clock driver probes but
before any drivers use dma APIs.
