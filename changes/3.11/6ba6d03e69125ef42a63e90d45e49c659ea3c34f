drm: Print pretty names for pixel formats

Rather than just printing the pixel format as a hex number, decode the
fourcc into human readable form, and also decode the LE vs. BE flag.

Keep printing the raw hex number too in case it contains non-printable
characters.

Some examples what the new drm_get_format_name() produces:
DRM_FORMAT_XRGB8888: "XR24 little-endian (0x34325258)"
DRM_FORMAT_YUYV: "YUYV little-endian (0x56595559)"
DRM_FORMAT_RGB565|DRM_FORMAT_BIG_ENDIAN: "RG16 big-endian (0xb6314752)"
Unprintable characters: "D??? big-endian (0xff7f0244)"
