md: Wait for md_check_recovery before attempting device removal.

When a device has failed, it needs to be removed from the personality
module before it can be removed from the array as a whole.
The first step is performed by md_check_recovery() which is called
from the raid management thread.

So when a HOT_REMOVE ioctl arrives, wait briefly for md_check_recovery
to have run.  This increases the chance that the ioctl will succeed.
