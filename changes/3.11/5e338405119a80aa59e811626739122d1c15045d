drm/ttm: convert to the reservation api

Now that the code is compatible in semantics, flip the switch.
Use ww_mutex instead of the homegrown implementation.

ww_mutex uses -EDEADLK to signal that the caller has to back off,
and -EALREADY to indicate this buffer is already held by the caller.

ttm used -EAGAIN and -EDEADLK for those, respectively. So some changes
were needed to handle this correctly.
