drm/i915: don't check encoder at DP connector destroy()

By the time we call intel_dp_destroy (which destroys the connector)
the encoder may have been destroyed already, so if we use it we may be
reading some free memory. That happens in drm_mode_config_cleanup()
and also inside intel_dp_init_connector() when we detect a ghost eDP.

I also hope this may solve some random memory bugs.
