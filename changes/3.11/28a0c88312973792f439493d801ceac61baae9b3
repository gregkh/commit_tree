drivers/rtc/rtc-stmp3xxx.c: provide timeout for potentially endless loop polling a HW bit

It's always a bad idea to poll on HW bits without a timeout.

The i.MX28 RTC can be easily brought into a state in which the RTC is
not running (until after a power-on-reset) and thus the status bits
which are polled in the driver won't ever change.

This patch prevents the kernel from getting stuck in this case.
