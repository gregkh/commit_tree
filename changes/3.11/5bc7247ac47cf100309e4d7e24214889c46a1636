Btrfs: fix broken nocow after balance

Balance will create reloc_root for each fs root, and it's going to
record last_snapshot to filter shared blocks.  The side effect of
setting last_snapshot is to break nocow attributes of files.

Since the extents are not shared by the relocation tree after the balance,
we can recover the old last_snapshot safely if no one snapshoted the
source tree. We fix the above problem by this way.
