e1000e: Release mutex lock only if it has been initially acquired

This patch fixes the issue of unlocking swflag_mutex for 82574 and 82583
devices regardless of if the hw semaphore has been successfully acquired via
e1000_get_hw_semaphore_82574(). With this patch, unlocking mutex now depends
on if the hw semaphore was successfully acquired before. And 82574/82583
devices are reset regardless of whether e1000_get_hw_semaphore_82574()
returns success or failure.
