arm: mvebu: remove dependency of SMP init on static I/O mapping

The ->smp_init_cpus() function is called very early during boot, at a
point where dynamic I/O mappings are not yet possible. However, in the
Armada 370/XP implementation of this function, we have to get the
number of CPUs. We used to do that by accessing a hardware register,
which requires relying on a static I/O mapping set up by
->map_io(). Not only this requires hardcoding a virtual address, but
it also prevents us from removing the static I/O mapping.

So this commit changes the way used to get the number of CPUs: we now
use the Device Tree, which is a representation of the hardware, and
provides us the number of available CPUs. This is also more accurate,
because it potentially allows to boot the Linux kernel on only a
number of CPUs given by the Device Tree, instead of unconditionally on
all CPUs.

As a consequence, the coherency_get_cpu_count() function becomes no
longer used, so we remove it.
