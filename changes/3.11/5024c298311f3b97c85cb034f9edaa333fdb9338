md: Remove recent change which allows devices to skip recovery.

commit 7ceb17e87bde79d285a8b988cfed9eaeebe60b86
    md: Allow devices to be re-added to a read-only array.

allowed a bit more than just that.  It also allows devices to be added
to a read-write array and to end up skipping recovery.

This patch removes the offending piece of code pending a rewrite for a
subsequent release.

More specifically:
 If the array has a bitmap, then the device will still need a bitmap
 based resync ('saved_raid_disk' is set under different conditions
 is a bitmap is present).
 If the array doesn't have a bitmap, then this is correct as long as
 nothing has been written to the array since the metadata was checked
 by ->validate_super.  However there is no locking to ensure that there
 was no write.

Bug was introduced in 3.10 and causes data corruption so
patch is suitable for 3.10-stable.
