arm: mvebu: remove hardcoded static I/O mapping

Now that we have removed the need of the static I/O mapping for early
initialization reasons, and fixed the registers area length that were
broken, we can get rid of the static I/O mapping. Only the earlyprintk
mapping needs to be set up, using the debug_ll_io_init() helper
function.
