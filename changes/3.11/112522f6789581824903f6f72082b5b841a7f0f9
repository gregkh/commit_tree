drm/i915: put context upon switching

In order to be notified of when the context and all of its associated
objects is idle (for if the context maps to a ppgtt) we need a callback
from the retire handler. We can arrange this by using the kref_get/put
of the context for request tracking and by inserting a request to
demarque the switch away from the old context.
