cgroup: rename CGRP_REMOVED to CGRP_DEAD

We will add another flag indicating that the cgroup is in the process
of being killed.  REMOVING / REMOVED is more difficult to distinguish
and cgroup_is_removing()/cgroup_is_removed() are a bit awkward.  Also,
later percpu_ref usage will involve "kill"ing the refcnt.

 s/CGRP_REMOVED/CGRP_DEAD/
 s/cgroup_is_removed()/cgroup_is_dead()

This patch is purely cosmetic.
