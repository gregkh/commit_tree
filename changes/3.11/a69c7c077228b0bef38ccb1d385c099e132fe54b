xfs: use XFS_BMAP_BMDR_SPACE vs. XFS_BROOT_SIZE_ADJ

XFS_BROOT_SIZE_ADJ is an undocumented macro which accounts for
the difference in size between the on-disk and in-core btree
root.  It's much clearer to just use the newly-added
XFS_BMAP_BMDR_SPACE macro which gives us the on-disk size
directly.

In one case, we must test that the if_broot exists before
applying the macro, however.
