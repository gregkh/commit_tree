[media] exynos4-is: Add Exynos5250 SoC support to fimc-lite driver

This patch adds support for the Exynos5250 SoC variant of the FIMC-LITE
IP. A 'compatible' string is added for Exynos5250 compatible devices
and the capture DMA handling is reworked to use the FLITE_REG_CIFCNTSEQ
register, masking output DMA buffer address slots. The frame interrupt
is enabled so there are now 2 interrupts per frame. This likely can be
optimized in future by using any status registers that allow to figure
out what the last and the currently written frame buffer is. It would
also be more reliable in cases where there are high interrupt service
latencies.
