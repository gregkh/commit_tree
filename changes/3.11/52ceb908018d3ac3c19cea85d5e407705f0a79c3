drm/i915: make sure GPU freq drops to minimum after entering RC6 v4

On VLV, the Punit doesn't automatically drop the GPU to it's minimum
voltage level when entering RC6, so we arm a timer to do it for us from
the RPS interrupt handler.  It'll generally only fire when we go idle
(or if for some reason there's a long delay between RPS interrupts), but
won't be re-armed again until the next RPS event, so shouldn't affect
power consumption after we go idle and it triggers.

v2: use delayed work instead of timer + work queue combo (Ville)
v3: fix up delayed work cancel (must be outside lock) (Daniel)
    fix up delayed work handling func for delayed work (Jesse)
v4: cancel delayed work before RPS shutdown (Jani)
    pass delay not absolute time to mod_delayed_work (Jani)
