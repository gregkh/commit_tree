    drm/i915: Hook up Ivybridge eDP

This fixes eDP link-training failures and cases where all voltage swing
/pre-emphasis levels were tried and failed during clock recovery and -
as a fallback - we go on to do channel equalization with the last voltage
swing/pre-emphasis level which will succeed. Both issues can lead to a
blank screen.
