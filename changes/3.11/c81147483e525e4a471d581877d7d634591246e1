x86 thermal: Delete power-limit-notification console messages

Package power limits are common on some systems under some conditions --
so printing console messages when limits are reached
causes unnecessary customer concern and support calls.

Note that even with these console messages gone,
the events can still be observed via system counters:

$ grep TRM /proc/interrupts

Shows total thermal interrupts, which includes both power
limit notifications and thermal throttling interrupts.

$ grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/thermal_throttle/*

Will show what caused those interrupts, core and package
throttling and power limit notifications.
