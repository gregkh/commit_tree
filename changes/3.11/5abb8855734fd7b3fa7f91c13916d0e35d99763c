cgroup: consistently use @cset for struct css_set variables

cgroup.c uses @cg for most struct css_set variables, which in itself
could be a bit confusing, but made much worse by the fact that there
are places which use @cg for struct cgroup variables.
compare_css_sets() epitomizes this confusion - @[old_]cg are struct
css_set while @cg[12] are struct cgroup.

It's not like the whole deal with cgroup, css_set and cg_cgroup_link
isn't already confusing enough.  Let's give it some sanity by
uniformly using @cset for all struct css_set variables.

* s/cg/cset/ for all css_set variables.

* s/oldcg/old_cset/ s/oldcgrp/old_cgrp/.  The same for the ones
  prefixed with "new".

* s/cg/cgrp/ for cgroup variables in compare_css_sets().

* s/css/cset/ for the cgroup variable in task_cgroup_from_root().

* Whiteline adjustments.

This patch is purely cosmetic.
