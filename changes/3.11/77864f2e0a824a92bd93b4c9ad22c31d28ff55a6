FMC: add core bus driver

This module offers registration services for both carriers
(i.e. devices) and mezzanines (i.e. drivers). The matching for devices
and drivers is performed according to the IPMI standard for FRU
devices (Field Replaceable Units).

The code includes support for parsing an SDB tree if present in the FPGA,
and dumping it for diagnostics. SDB is not mandatory.
