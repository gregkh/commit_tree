ARM: fix type of PHYS_PFN_OFFSET to unsigned long

On LPAE machines, PHYS_OFFSET evaluates to a phys_addr_t and this type is
inherited by the PHYS_PFN_OFFSET definition as well.  Consequently, the kernel
build emits warnings of the form:

init/main.c: In function 'start_kernel':
init/main.c:588:7: warning: format '%lx' expects argument of type 'long unsigned int', but argument 2 has type 'phys_addr_t' [-Wformat]

This patch fixes this warning by pinning down the PFN type to unsigned long.
