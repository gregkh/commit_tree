linux/const.h: Add _BITUL() and _BITULL()

Add macros for single bit definitions of a specific type.  These are
similar to the BIT() macro that already exists, but with a few
exceptions:

1. The namespace is such that they can be used in uapi definitions.
2. The type is set with the _AC() macro to allow it to be used in
   assembly.
3. The type is explicitly specified to be UL or ULL.
