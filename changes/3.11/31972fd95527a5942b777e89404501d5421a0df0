clk: tegra114: implement wait_for_reset and disable_clock for tegra_cpu_car_ops

The conventional CPU hotplug sequence on the other Tegra chips, we will also
clock gate the CPU in tegra_cpu_kill() after the CPU was power gated. For
Tegra114, the flow controller will clock gate the CPU after the power down
sequence. But we still need to implement a empty function for disable_clock
to avoid kernel warning message.
