mm: vmscan: treat pages marked for immediate reclaim as zone congestion

Currently a zone will only be marked congested if the underlying BDI is
congested but if dirty pages are spread across zones it is possible that
an individual zone is full of dirty pages without being congested.  The
impact is that zone gets scanned very quickly potentially reclaiming
really clean pages.  This patch treats pages marked for immediate
reclaim as congested for the purposes of marking a zone ZONE_CONGESTED
and stalling in wait_iff_congested.
