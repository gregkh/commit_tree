ext4: don't wait for extent conversion in ext4_punch_hole()

We don't have to wait for extent conversion in ext4_punch_hole() as
buffered IO for the punched range has been flushed and waited upon
(thus all extent conversions for that range have completed).  Also we
wait for all DIO to finish using inode_dio_wait() so there cannot be
any extent conversions pending due to direct IO.

Also remove ext4_flush_unwritten_io() since it's unused now.
