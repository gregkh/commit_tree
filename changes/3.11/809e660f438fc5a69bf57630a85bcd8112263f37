ARM: 7775/1: mm: Remove do_sect_fault from LPAE code

For LPAE, do_sect_fault used to be invoked as the second level access
flag handler. When transparent huge pages were introduced for LPAE,
do_page_fault was used instead.

Unfortunately, do_sect_fault remains defined but not used for LPAE code
resulting in a compile warning.

This patch surrounds do_sect_fault with #ifndef CONFIG_ARM_LPAE to fix
this warning.
