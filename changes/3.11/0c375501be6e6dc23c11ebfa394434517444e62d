serial: imx: enable the clocks for console

The console's clocks are disabled after the uart driver is probed.
It makes that we can see less log from the console now
(though we still can get all the log by the `dmesg`).

So enable the clocks for console, and we can see all the log again.

This patch also disables the sport->clk_per when we fail to enable
the sport->clk_ipg;
