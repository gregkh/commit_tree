macvtap: Consistently use rcu functions

Currently macvtap uses rcu_bh functions in its
user facing fuction macvtap_get_user() and macvtap_put_user().
However, its packet handlers use normal rcu as the rcu_read_lock()
is taken in netif_receive_skb().  We can safely discontinue
the usage or rcu with bh disabled.
