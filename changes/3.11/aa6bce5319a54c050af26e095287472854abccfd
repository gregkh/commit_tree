I2C: mv64xxx: remove I2C_M_NOSTART code

As this driver does not advertise protocol mangling support
(I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING is not set), having code to act on
I2C_M_NOSTART is illogical, and in any case isn't supportable on
anything but the first message - which makes no sense.  Remove
the I2C_M_NOSTART code.
