mm: move_ptes -- Set soft dirty bit depending on pte type

Dave reported corrupted swap entries

 | [ 4588.541886] swap_free: Unused swap offset entry 00002d15
 | [ 4588.541952] BUG: Bad page map in process trinity-kid12  pte:005a2a80 pmd:22c01f067

and Hugh pointed that in move_ptes _PAGE_SOFT_DIRTY bit set regardless
the type of entry pte consists of.  The trick here is that when we carry
soft dirty status in swap entries we are to use _PAGE_SWP_SOFT_DIRTY
instead, because this is the only place in pte which can be used for own
needs without intersecting with bits owned by swap entry type/offset.
