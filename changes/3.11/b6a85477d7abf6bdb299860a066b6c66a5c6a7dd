ARM: OMAP1: Remove legacy irda.h and irda setup from board files

omap-ir.c driver has never been upstream and was also removed from
linux-omap.git four years ago (See linux-omap.git commit efd1e3f
("REMOVE OMAP LEGACY CODE: Reset drivers/net/irda to mainline")).

Therefore remove needless device registration from a few board files
and delete thus to be unused arch/arm/mach-omap1/include/mach/irda.h
and unused OMAP_DMA_UART3_* definitions from dma.h.
