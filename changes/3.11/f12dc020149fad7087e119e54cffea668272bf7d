cgroup: mark "tasks" cgroup file as insane

Some resources controlled by cgroup aren't per-task and cgroup core
allowing threads of a single thread_group to be in different cgroups
forced memcg do explicitly find the group leader and use it.  This is
gonna be nasty when transitioning to unified hierarchy and in general
we don't want and won't support granularity finer than processes.

Mark "tasks" with CFTYPE_INSANE.
