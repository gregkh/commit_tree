powerpc/numa: Do not update sysfs cpu registration from invalid context

The topology update code that updates the cpu node registration in sysfs
should not be called while in stop_machine(). The register/unregister
calls take a lock and may sleep.

This patch moves these calls outside of the call to stop_machine().
