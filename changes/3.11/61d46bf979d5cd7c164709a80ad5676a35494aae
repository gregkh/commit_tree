macvtap: correctly linearize skb when zerocopy is used

Userspace may produce vectors greater than MAX_SKB_FRAGS. When we try to
linearize parts of the skb to let the rest of iov to be fit in
the frags, we need count copylen into linear when calling macvtap_alloc_skb()
instead of partly counting it into data_len. Since this breaks
zerocopy_sg_from_iovec() since its inner counter assumes nr_frags should
be zero at beginning. This cause nr_frags to be increased wrongly without
setting the correct frags.

This bug were introduced from b92946e2919134ebe2a4083e4302236295ea2a73
(macvtap: zerocopy: validate vectors before building skb).
