    drm/i915: Workaround incoherence with fence updates on Valleyview

Jon Bloomfield came up with a plausible explanation and cheap fix
(drm/i915: Fix incoherence with fence updates on Sandybridge+) for the
race condition, so lets run with it.

This is a candidate for stable as the old workaround incurs a
significant cost (calling wbinvd on all CPUs before performing the
register write) for some workloads as noted by Carsten Emde.
