clocksource: dw_apb_timer_of: enable the use the clocksource as sched clock

Currently the dw_apb_timer always expects a separate special timer to be
availbable for the sched_clock. Some devices using dw_apb_timers do not
have this sptimer but can use the clocksource as sched_clock instead.

Therefore enable the driver to distiguish between devices with and without
sptimer based on the devicetree data and select the correct timer as
sched_clock.
