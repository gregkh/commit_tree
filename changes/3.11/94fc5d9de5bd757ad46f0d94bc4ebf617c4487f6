proc: return on proc_readdir error

Commit f0c3b5093add ("[readdir] convert procfs") introduced a bug on the
listing of the proc file-system.  The return value of proc_readdir()
isn't tested anymore in the proc_root_readdir function.

This lead to an "interesting" behaviour when we are using the getdents()
system call with a buffer too small: instead of failing, it returns the
first entries of /proc (enough to fill the given buffer), plus the PID
directories.

This is not triggered on glibc (as getdents is called with a 32KB
buffer), but on uclibc, the buffer size is only 1KB, thus some proc
entries are missing.
