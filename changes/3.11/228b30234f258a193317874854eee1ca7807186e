Revert "cpuidle: Quickly notice prediction failure in general case"

Revert commit e11538d1 (cpuidle: Quickly notice prediction failure in
general case), since it depends on commit 69a37be (cpuidle: Quickly
notice prediction failure for repeat mode) that has been identified
as the source of a significant performance regression in v3.8 and
later.
