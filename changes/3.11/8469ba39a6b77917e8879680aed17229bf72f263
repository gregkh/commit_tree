IB/qib: Add DCA support

This patch adds DCA cache warming for systems that support DCA.

The code uses cpu affinity notification to react to an affinity change
from a user mode program like irqbalance and (re-)program the chip
accordingly. This notification avoids reading the current cpu on every
interrupt.
