x86/xen: do not identity map UNUSABLE regions in the machine E820

If there are UNUSABLE regions in the machine memory map, dom0 will
attempt to map them 1:1 which is not permitted by Xen and the kernel
will crash.

There isn't anything interesting in the UNUSABLE region that the dom0
kernel needs access to so we can avoid making the 1:1 mapping and
treat it as RAM.

We only do this for dom0, as that is where tboot case shows up.
A PV domU could have an UNUSABLE region in its pseudo-physical map
and would need to be handled in another patch.

This fixes a boot failure on hosts with tboot.

tboot marks a region in the e820 map as unusable and the dom0 kernel
would attempt to map this region and Xen does not permit unusable
regions to be mapped by guests.
