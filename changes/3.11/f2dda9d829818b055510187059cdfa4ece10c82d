arm/kvm: Cleanup KVM_ARM_MAX_VCPUS logic

Commit d21a1c83c7595e387545632e44cd7797b76e19cc (ARM: KVM: define KVM_ARM_MAX_VCPUS
unconditionally) changed the Kconfig logic for KVM_ARM_MAX_VCPUS to work around a
build error arising from the use of KVM_ARM_MAX_VCPUS when CONFIG_KVM=n.  The
resulting Kconfig logic is a bit awkward and leaves a KVM_ARM_MAX_VCPUS always
defined in the kernel config file.

This change reverts the Kconfig logic back and adds a simple preprocessor
conditional in kvm_host.h to handle when CONFIG_KVM_ARM_MAX_VCPUS is undefined.
