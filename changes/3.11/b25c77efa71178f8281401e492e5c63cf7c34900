ACPI / PM: Rename function acpi_device_power_state() and make it static

There is a name clash between function acpi_device_power_state()
defined in drivers/acpi/device_pm.c and structure type
acpi_device_power_state defined in include/acpi/acpi_bus.h, which
may be resolved by renaming the function.  Additionally, that
funtion may be made static, because it is not used anywhere outside
of the file it is defined in.

Rename acpi_device_power_state() to acpi_dev_pm_get_state(), which
better reflects its purpose, and make it static.
