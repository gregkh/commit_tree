staging: rtl8192u: fix newlines in r819xU_phy.c

This patch fixes the newlines by:
- adding a newline after variables declarations.
- removing the newlines following the return statement.
- removing the newlines between function header comments
  and function definitions.
- adding one newline between function definitions.
- adding a newline at the end of RT_TRACE messages.

This was done to improve code's and logmessages'
readability.
