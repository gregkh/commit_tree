memcg: use css_get/put for swap memcg

Use css_get/put instead of mem_cgroup_get/put.  A simple replacement
will do.

The historical reason that memcg has its own refcnt instead of always
using css_get/put, is that cgroup couldn't be removed if there're still
css refs, so css refs can't be used as long-lived reference.  The
situation has changed so that rmdir a cgroup will succeed regardless css
refs, but won't be freed until css refs goes down to 0.
