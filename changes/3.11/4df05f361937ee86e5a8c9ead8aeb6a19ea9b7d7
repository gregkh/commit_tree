x86: Make sure IDT is page aligned

Since the IDT is referenced from a fixmap, make sure it is page aligned.
Merge with 32-bit one, since it was already aligned to deal with F00F
bug. Since bss is cleared before IDT setup, it can live there. This also
moves the other *_idt_table variables into common locations.

This avoids the risk of the IDT ever being moved in the bss and having
the mapping be offset, resulting in calling incorrect handlers. In the
current upstream kernel this is not a manifested bug, but heavily patched
kernels (such as those using the PaX patch series) did encounter this bug.

The tables other than idt_table technically do not need to be page
aligned, at least not at the current time, but using a common
declaration avoids mistakes.  On 64 bits the table is exactly one page
long, anyway.
