Driver core / memory: Simplify __memory_block_change_state()

As noted by Tang Chen, the last_online field in struct memory_block
introduced by commit 4960e05 (Driver core: Introduce offline/online
callbacks for memory blocks) is not really necessary, because
online_pages() restores the previous state if passed ONLINE_KEEP as
the last argument.  Therefore, remove that field along with the code
referring to it.
