powerpc: Rework setting up H/FSCR bit definitions

This reworks the Facility Status and Control Regsiter (FSCR) config bit
definitions so that we can access the bit numbers.  This is needed for a
subsequent patch to fix the userspace DSCR handling.

HFSCR and FSCR bit definitions are the same, so reuse them.
