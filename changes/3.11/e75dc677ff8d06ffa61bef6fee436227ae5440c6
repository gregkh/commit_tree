hso: Fix stack corruption on some architectures

As Sergei Shtylyov explained in the #mipslinux IRC channel:
[Mon 2013-08-19 12:28:21 PM PDT] <headless> guys, are you sure it's not "DMA off stack" case?
[Mon 2013-08-19 12:28:35 PM PDT] <headless> it's a known stack corruptor on non-coherent arches
[Mon 2013-08-19 12:31:48 PM PDT] <DonkeyHotei> headless: for usb/ehci?
[Mon 2013-08-19 12:34:11 PM PDT] <DonkeyHotei> headless: explain
[Mon 2013-08-19 12:35:38 PM PDT] <headless> usb_control_msg() (or other such func) should not use buffer on stack. DMA from/to stack is prohibited
[Mon 2013-08-19 12:35:58 PM PDT] <headless> and EHCI uses DMA on control xfers (as well as all the others)
