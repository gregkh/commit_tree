xen/blkback: Use physical sector size for setup

Currently xen-blkback passes the logical sector size over xenbus and
xen-blkfront sets up the paravirt disk with that logical block size.
But newer drives usually have the logical sector size set to 512 for
compatibility reasons and would show the actual sector size only in
physical sector size.
This results in the device being partitioned and accessed in dom0 with
the correct sector size, but the guest thinks 512 bytes is the correct
block size. And that results in poor performance.

To fix this, blkback gets modified to pass also physical-sector-size
over xenbus and blkfront to use both values to set up the paravirt
disk. I did not just change the passed in sector-size because I am
not sure having a bigger logical sector size than the physical one
is valid (and that would happen if a newer dom0 kernel hits an older
domU kernel). Also this way a domU set up before should still be
accessible (just some tools might detect the unaligned setup).

[v2: Make xenbus write failure non-fatal]
[v3: Use xenbus_scanf instead of xenbus_gather]
[v4: Rebased against segment changes]
