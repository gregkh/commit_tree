ip_tunnel: Do not use inner ip-header-id for tunnel ip-header-id.

Using inner-id for tunnel id is not safe in some rare cases.
E.g. packets coming from multiple sources entering same tunnel
can have same id. Therefore on tunnel packet receive we
could have packets from two different stream but with same
source and dst IP with same ip-id which could confuse ip packet
reassembly.

Following patch reverts optimization from commit
490ab08127 (IP_GRE: Fix IP-Identification.)
