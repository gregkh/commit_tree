MIPS: Netlogic: Fix nlm_read_c2_status() definition

The sel argument os nlm_read_c2_status() was not used and the macro
returned the sel 0 in all cases. Fix this by defining two macros:
nlm_read_c2_status0() and nlm_read_c2_status1() to return the two
status registers.

Add functions to write to the status registers as well.
