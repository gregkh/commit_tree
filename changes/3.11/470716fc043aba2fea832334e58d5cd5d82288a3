rcu: Switch callers from rcu_process_gp_end() to note_gp_changes()

Because note_gp_changes() now incorporates rcu_process_gp_end() function,
this commit switches to the former and eliminates the latter.  In
addition, this commit changes external calls from __rcu_process_gp_end()
to __note_gp_changes().
