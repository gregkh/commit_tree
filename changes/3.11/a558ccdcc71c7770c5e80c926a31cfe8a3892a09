usb: xhci: add USB2 Link power management BESL support

usb 2.0 devices with link power managment (LPM) can describe their idle link
timeouts either in BESL or HIRD format, so far xHCI has only supported HIRD but
later xHCI errata add BESL support as well

BESL timeouts need to inform exit latency changes with an evaluate
context command the same way USB 3.0 link PM code does.
The same xhci_change_max_exit_latency() function is used as with USB3
but code is pulled out from #ifdef CONFIG_PM as USB2.0 BESL LPM
funcionality does not depend on CONFIG_PM.
