powerpc/pseries: Drop "select HOTPLUG"

The Kconfig symbol HOTPLUG was removed with commit 40b313608a ("Finally
eradicate CONFIG_HOTPLUG"). But there's still one select statement for
that symbol. It seems that select statement was added after the patch to
remove CONFIG_HOTPLUG was submitted. Anyhow, it is useless and can be
dropped.
