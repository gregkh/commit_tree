                                        <skip client dir removing>

To fix this, this patch does the following:

1) Calls RPC_PIPEFS_UMOUNT notification with sn->pipefs_sb_lock being held.
2) Removes SUNRPC client from the list AFTER pipes destroying.
3) Doesn't hold RPC client on notification: if client in the list, then it
can't be destroyed while sn->pipefs_sb_lock in hold by notification caller.
