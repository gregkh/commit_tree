batman-adv: change VID semantic in the BLA code

In order to make batman-adv fully vlan aware later, the
semantic used for variables storing the VLAN ID values has
to be changed in order to be adapted to the new one which
will be used batman-adv wide.

In particular, the VID has to be an "_unsigned_ short int"
and its 4 MSB will be used as a flag bitfield, while the
remaining 12 bits are used to store the real VID value
