[media] v4l2-ioctl: dbg_g/s_register: only match BRIDGE and SUBDEV types

Drop support for V4L2_CHIP_MATCH_I2C_DRIVER/ADDR and V4L2_CHIP_MATCH_AC97
types. The following patches will remove support for those in the drivers
as well.
This means that bridge drivers no longer have to check for the match.type
field in their g/s_register implementations. Only if they also implement
g_chip_info do they still have to check the match.addr field, otherwise the
core will check for that as well.
