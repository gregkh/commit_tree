vxlan: add necessary locking on device removal

The socket management is now done in workqueue (outside of RTNL)
and protected by vn->sock_lock. There were two possible bugs, first
the vxlan device was removed from the VNI hash table per socket without
holding lock. And there was a race when device is created and the workqueue
could run after deletion.
