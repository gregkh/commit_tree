Revert "sched: Introduce temporary FAIR_GROUP_SCHED dependency for load-tracking"

Remove CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED that covers the runnable info, then
we can use runnable load variables.

Also remove 2 CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED setting which is not in reverted
patch(introduced in 9ee474f), but also need to revert.
