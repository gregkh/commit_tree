drivers: pinctrl sleep and idle states in the core

If a device have sleep and idle states in addition to the
default state, look up these in the core and stash them in
the pinctrl state container.

Add accessor functions for pinctrl consumers to put the pins
into "default", "sleep" and "idle" states passing nothing but
the struct device * affected.

Solution suggested by Kevin Hilman, Mark Brown and Dmitry
Torokhov in response to a patch series from Hebbar
Gururaja.
