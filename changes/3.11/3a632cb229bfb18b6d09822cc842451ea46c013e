perf/x86/intel: Add simple Haswell PMU support

Similar to SandyBridge, but has a few new events and two
new counter bits.

There are some new counter flags that need to be prevented
from being set on fixed counters, and allowed to be set
for generic counters.

Also we add support for the counter 2 constraint to handle
all raw events.

(Contains fixes from Stephane Eranian.)
