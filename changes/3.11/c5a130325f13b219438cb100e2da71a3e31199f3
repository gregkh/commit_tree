ACPI/APEI: Add parameter check before error injection

When param1 is enabled in EINJ but not assigned with a valid
value, sometimes it will cause the error like below:

APEI: Can not request [mem 0x7aaa7000-0x7aaa7007] for APEI EINJ Trigger registers

It is because some firmware will access target address specified in
param1 to trigger the error when injecting memory error. This will
cause resource conflict with regular memory. So It must be removed
from trigger table resources, but incorrect param1/param2
combination will stop this action. Add extra check to avoid
this kind of error.
