Smack: Local IPv6 port based controls

Smack does not provide access controls on IPv6 communications.
This patch introduces a mechanism for maintaining Smack lables
for local IPv6 communications. It is based on labeling local ports.
The behavior should be compatible with any future "real" IPv6
support as it provides no interfaces for users to manipulate
the labeling. Remote IPv6 connections use the ambient label
the same way that unlabeled IPv4 packets are treated.
