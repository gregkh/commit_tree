drm/i915: add enable_ips module option

IPS is still enabled by default. Feature requested by the power
management team.

This should also help testing the feature on some early pre-production
hardware where there were relationship problems between IPS and PSR.

v2: Rebase on top of the newest IPS implementation.
v3: Check i915_enable_ips at compute_config, not supports_ips, so the
    kernel parameter will be ignored at haswell_get_pipe_config.
