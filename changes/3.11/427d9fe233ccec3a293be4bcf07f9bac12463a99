xfs: check on-disk (not incore) btree root size in dfrag.c

xfs_swap_extents_check_format() contains checks to make sure that
original and the temporary files during defrag are compatible;
Gabriel VLASIU ran into a case where xfs_fsr returned EINVAL
because the tests found the btree root to be of size 120,
while the fork offset was only 104; IOW, they overlapped.

However, this is just due to an error in the
xfs_swap_extents_check_format() tests, because it is checking
the in-memory btree root size against the on-disk fork offset.
We should be checking the on-disk sizes in both cases.

This patch adds a new macro to calculate this size, and uses
it in the tests.

With this change, the filesystem image provided by Gabriel
allows for proper file degragmentation.
