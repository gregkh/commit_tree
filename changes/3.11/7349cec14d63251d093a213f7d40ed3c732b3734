[media] media: Add a function removing all links of a media entity

This function allows to remove all media entity's links to other
entities, leaving no references to a media entity's links array
at its remote entities.
Currently, when a driver of some entity is removed it will free its
media entities links[] array, leaving dangling pointers at other
entities that are part of same media graph. This is troublesome when
drivers of a media device entities are in separate kernel modules,
removing only some modules will leave others in an incorrect state.
This function is intended to be used when an entity is being
unregistered from a media device.
With an assumption that normally the media links should be created
between media entities registered to a media device, with the graph
mutex held.
