tpm: fix regression caused by section type conflict of tpm_dev_release() in ppc builds

The 8119807 commit reintroduced a regression
(error: __ksymtab_tpm_dev_release causes a section type conflict) that was fixed by commit
cbb2ed4.
Fix it for good by adding the prototype to tpm.h so sparse doesn't
complain about it anymore.
