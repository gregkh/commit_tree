r8169: remove "PHY reset until link up" log spam

This message was added in commit a7154cb8 (June 2004, [PATCH] r8169:
link handling and phy reset rework) and is printed every ten seconds
when no cable is connected and runtime power management is disabled.
(Before that commit, "Reset RTL8169s PHY" would be printed instead.)
