[media] em28xx: remove GPIO register caching

The GPIO register caching is the result of wrong assumptions and incomplete
knowledge about the GPIO registers and their functionality.
Today, we know that it is not needed.
It is also limited to a single register and therefore incomplete (newer chips
are using multiple registers).
Instead of extending the caching, get rid of it, because it has no real
benefits and just bloats/complicates the code.
