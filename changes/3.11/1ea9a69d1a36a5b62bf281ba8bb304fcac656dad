ALSA: hda - Fix EAPD GPIO control for Sigmatel codecs

The EAPD GPIO is dynamically turned on/off for some machines with
Sigmatel codecs, but this didn't work as expected, and it resulted in
spontaneous lost of speaker outputs per HP plugging or power-saving.

This patch fixes the bug by simply including spec->eapd_mask into
spec->gpio_mask and spec->gpio_data bits.
