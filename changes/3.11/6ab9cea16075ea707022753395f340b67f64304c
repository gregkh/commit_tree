sysfs: add support for binary attributes in groups

groups should be able to support binary attributes, just like it
supports "normal" attributes.  This lets us only handle one type of
structure, groups, throughout the driver core and subsystems, making
binary attributes a "full fledged" part of the driver model, and not
something just "tacked on".
