[SCSI] qla2xxx: Help Coverity with analyzing ct_sns_pkt initialization.

Coverity reports "Overrunning struct type ct_sns_req of 1228 bytes
by passing it to a function which accesses it at byte offset 8207"
for each qla2x00_prep_ct_req(), qla2x00_prep_ct_fdmi_req() and
qla24xx_prep_ct_fm_req() call. Help Coverity to recognize that
these calls do not trigger a buffer overflow by making it explicit
that these three functions initializes both the request and reply
structures. This patch does not change any functionality.
