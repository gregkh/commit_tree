xfrm: introduce helper for safe determination of mtu

skb->sk socket can be of AF_INET or AF_INET6 address family. Thus we
always have to make sure we a referring to the correct interpretation
of skb->sk.

We only depend on header defines to query the mtu, so we don't introduce
a new dependency to ipv6 by this change.
