RDMA/ucma: Name changes to indicate only IP addresses supported

Several commands into the RDMA CM from user space are restricted to
supporting addresses which fit into a sockaddr_in6 structure: bind
address, resolve address, and join multicast.

With the addition of AF_IB, we need to support addresses which are
larger than sockaddr_in6.  This will be done by adding new commands
that exchange address information using sockaddr_storage.  However, to
support existing applications, we maintain the current commands and
structures, but rename them to indicate that they only support IPv4
and v6 addresses.
