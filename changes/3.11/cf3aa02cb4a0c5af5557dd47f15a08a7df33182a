svcrpc: fix handling of too-short rpc's

If we detect that an rpc is too short, we abort and close the
connection.  Except, there's a bug here: we're leaving sk_datalen
nonzero without leaving any pages in the sk_pages array.  The most
likely result of the inconsistency is a subsequent crash in
svc_tcp_clear_pages.

Also demote the BUG_ON in svc_tcp_clear_pages to a WARN.
