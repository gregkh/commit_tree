pinctrl: more clarifications for generic pull configs

PULL_PIN_DEFAULT is meant for hardware completely hiding any pull
settings from the driver, so that it's really only possible to turn
the pull on or off, but it not being possible to determine any
pull settings from software.

Also the binding-documentation for the pull arguments did not match
the changes to the expected values.
