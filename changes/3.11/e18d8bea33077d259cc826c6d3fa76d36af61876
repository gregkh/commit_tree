[SCSI] scsi_debug: simplify offset calculation for dif_storep

dif_storep is declared as pointer to unsigned char type.  But it is
actually used to store vmalloced array of struct sd_dif_tuple.

This changes the type of dif_storep to the pointer to struct sd_dif_tuple.
It simplifies offset calculation for dif_storep and enables to remove
hardcoded size of struct sd_dif_tuple.
