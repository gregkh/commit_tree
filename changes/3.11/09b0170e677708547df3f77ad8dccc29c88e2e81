staging/lustre/tests: check nr_local in ofd_preprw()

This patch checks the number of bulk I/O RPC pages with
PTLRPC_MAX_BRW_PAGES in ofd_preprw() to avoid
LASSERT(iobuf->dr_npages < iobuf->dr_max_pages) occurring
while larger I/O size is specified.

The patch also fixes echo_client_prep_commit() to reuse
the env context so as to avoid LASSERT(info->fti_exp == NULL)
occurring while the bulk I/O size is larger than
PTLRPC_MAX_BRW_SIZE.

The patch also improves obdfilter-survey to handle the
case while interoprating with old server.

[picked echo client part for upstream kernel submission]
