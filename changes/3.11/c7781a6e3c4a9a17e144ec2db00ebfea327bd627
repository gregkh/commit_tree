tcp: initialize rcv_tstamp for restored sockets

u32 rcv_tstamp;     /* timestamp of last received ACK */

Its value used in tcp_retransmit_timer, which closes socket
if the last ack was received more then TCP_RTO_MAX ago.

Currently rcv_tstamp is initialized to zero and if tcp_retransmit_timer
is called before receiving a first ack, the connection is closed.

This patch initializes rcv_tstamp to a timestamp, when a socket was
restored.
