powernv/opal: Notifier for OPAL events

This patch implements a notifier to receive a notification on OPAL
event mask changes. The notifier is only called as a result of an OPAL
interrupt, which will happen upon reception of FSP messages or PCI errors.
Any event mask change detected as a result of opal_poll_events() will not
result in a notifier call.
