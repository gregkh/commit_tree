cgroup: clean up find_css_set() and friends

find_css_set() passes uninitialized on-stack template[] array to
find_existing_css_set() which sets the entries for all subsystems.
Passing around an uninitialized array is a bit icky and we want to
introduce an iterator which only iterates loaded subsystems.  Let's
initialize it on definition.

While at it, also make the following cosmetic cleanups.

* Convert to proper /** comments.

* Reorder variable declarations.

* Replace comment on synchronization with lockdep_assert_held().

This patch doesn't make any functional differences.
