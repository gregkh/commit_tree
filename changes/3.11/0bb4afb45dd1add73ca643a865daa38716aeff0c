irqdomain: Add a name field

This patch adds a name field to the irq_domain structure to help mere
mortals understand the mappings between irq domains and virqs. It also
converts a number of places that have open-coded some kind of fudging
an irqdomain name to use the new field. This means a more consistent
display of names in irq domain log messages and debugfs output.
