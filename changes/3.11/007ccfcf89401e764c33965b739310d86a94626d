ACPI: Drop physical_node_id_bitmap from struct acpi_device

The physical_node_id_bitmap in struct acpi_device is only used for
looking up the first currently unused dependent phyiscal node ID
by acpi_bind_one().  It is not really necessary, however, because
acpi_bind_one() walks the entire physical_node_list of the given
device object for sanity checking anyway and if that list is always
sorted by node_id, it is straightforward to find the first gap
between the currently used node IDs and use that number as the ID
of the new list node.

This also removes the artificial limit of the maximum number of
dependent physical devices per ACPI device object, which now depends
only on the capacity of unsigend int.  As a result, it fixes a
regression introduced by commit e2ff394 (ACPI / memhotplug: Bind
removable memory blocks to ACPI device nodes) that caused
acpi_memory_enable_device() to fail when the number of 128 MB blocks
within one removable memory module was greater than 32.
