ALSA: usb: uniform style used in MODULE_SUPPORTED_DEVICE()

In sound/usb/card.c and sound/usb/misc/ua101.c there are no spaces
between the vendor and the device names, use this style in the other
drivers too.

This also helps keeping consistency when new drivers copies from the
ones already in the mainline tree.
