jbd/jbd2: relocate bit_spinlock header to jbd_common

The bit_spinlock functions are only used for the jbd_lock_bh_state
functions (and friends) in jbd_common.h and are not directly used
by either of jbd.h or jbd2.h content.

The jbd_common file is new as of commit 446066724c36 ("jdb/jbd2: factor
out common functions from the jbd[2] header files") but common
(and isolated) headers were not considered for factoring at that time.
