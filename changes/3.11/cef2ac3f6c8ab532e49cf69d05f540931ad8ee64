vmalloc: make find_vm_area check in range

Currently, __find_vmap_area searches for the kernel VM area starting at
a given address.  This patch changes this behavior so that it searches
for the kernel VM area to which the address belongs.  This change is
needed by remap_vmalloc_range_partial to be introduced in later patch
that receives any position of kernel VM area as target address.

This patch changes the condition (addr > va->va_start) to the equivalent
(addr >= va->va_end) by taking advantage of the fact that each kernel VM
area is non-overlapping.
