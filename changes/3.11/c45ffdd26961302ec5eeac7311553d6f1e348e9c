NFSv4: Close another NFSv4 recovery race

State recovery currently relies on being able to find a valid
nfs_open_context in the inode->open_files list.
We therefore need to put the nfs_open_context on the list while
we're still protected by the sp->so_reclaim_seqcount in order
to avoid reboot races.
