Btrfs: remove unnecessary ->s_umount in cleaner_kthread()

In order to avoid the R/O remount, we acquired ->s_umount lock during
we deleted the dead snapshots and subvolumes. But it is unnecessary,
because we have cleaner_mutex.

We use cleaner_mutex to protect the process of the dead snapshots/subvolumes
deletion. And when we remount the fs to be R/O, we also acquire this mutex to
do cleanup after we change the status of the fs. That is this lock can serialize
the above operations, the cleaner can be aware of the status of the fs, and if
the cleaner is deleting the dead snapshots/subvolumes, the remount task will
wait for it. So it is safe to remove ->s_umount in cleaner_kthread().
