be2net: fix disabling TX in be_close()

commit fba875591 ("disable TX in be_close()") disabled TX in be_close()
to protect be_xmit() from touching freed up queues in the AER recovery
flow.  But, TX must be disabled *before* cleaning up TX completions in
the close() path, not after. This allows be_tx_compl_clean() to free up
all TX-req skbs that were notified to the HW.
