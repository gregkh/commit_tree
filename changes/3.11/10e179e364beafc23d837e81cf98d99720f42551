net: sun4i-emac: remove erroneous assignment

The newly added sun4i-emac driver causes a build error when
CONFIG_NET_POLL_CONTROLLER is set, because it attempts to
assign a pointer to netdev->poll_controller, which has
been replaced with ops->ndo_poll_controller in 2.6.31!

The correct assignment is present as well, so we just need
to remove the wrong one.
