sched: Fix sleep time double accounting in enqueue entity

The woken migrated task will __synchronize_entity_decay(se); in
migrate_task_rq_fair, then it needs to set
`se->avg.last_runnable_update -= (-se->avg.decay_count) << 20' before
update_entity_load_avg, in order to avoid sleep time is updated twice
for se.avg.load_avg_contrib in both __syncchronize and
update_entity_load_avg.

However if the sleeping task is woken up from the same cpu, it miss
the last_runnable_update before update_entity_load_avg(se, 0, 1), then
the sleep time was used twice in both functions.  So we need to remove
the double sleep time accounting.

Paul also contributed some code comments in this commit.
