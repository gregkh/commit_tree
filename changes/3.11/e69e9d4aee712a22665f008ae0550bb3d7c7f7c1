vmalloc: introduce remap_vmalloc_range_partial

We want to allocate ELF note segment buffer on the 2nd kernel in vmalloc
space and remap it to user-space in order to reduce the risk that memory
allocation fails on system with huge number of CPUs and so with huge ELF
note segment that exceeds 11-order block size.

Although there's already remap_vmalloc_range for the purpose of
remapping vmalloc memory to user-space, we need to specify user-space
range via vma.
 Mmap on /proc/vmcore needs to remap range across multiple objects, so
the interface that requires vma to cover full range is problematic.

This patch introduces remap_vmalloc_range_partial that receives user-space
range as a pair of base address and size and can be used for mmap on
/proc/vmcore case.

remap_vmalloc_range is rewritten using remap_vmalloc_range_partial.
