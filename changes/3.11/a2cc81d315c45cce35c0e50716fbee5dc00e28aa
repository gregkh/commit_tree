usb: gadget: uvc: Implement videobuf2 .wait_prepare and .wait_finish operations

Those optional operations are used to release and reacquire the queue
lock when videobuf2 needs to perform operations that sleep for a long
time, such as waiting for a buffer to be complete. Implement them to
avoid blocking qbuf or streamoff calls when a dqbuf is in progress.
