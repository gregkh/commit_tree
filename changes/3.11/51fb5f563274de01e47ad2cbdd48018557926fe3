powerpc/eeh: Make eeh_init() public

For EEH on PowerNV platform, we will do EEH probe based on the
real PCI devices. The PCI devices are available after PCI probe.
So we have to call eeh_init() explicitly on PowerNV platform
after PCI probe. The patch also does EEH probe for PowerNV platform
in eeh_init().
