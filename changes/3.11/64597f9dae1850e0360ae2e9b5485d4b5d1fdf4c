s390/ptrace: PTRACE_TE_ABORT_RAND

The patch implements a s390 specific ptrace request
PTRACE_TE_ABORT_RAND to modify the randomness of spontaneous
aborts of memory transactions of the transaction execution
facility. The data argument of the ptrace request is used to
specify the levels of randomness, 0 for normal operation, 1 to
abort every transaction at a random instruction, and 2 to abort
a random transaction at a random instruction. The default is 0
for normal operation.
