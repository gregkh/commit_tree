md/raid10: fix two problems with RAID10 resync.

1/ When an different between blocks is found, data is copied from
   one bio to the other.  However bv_len is used as the length to
   copy and this could be zero.  So use r10_bio->sectors to calculate
   length instead.
   Using bv_len was probably always a bit dubious, but the introduction
   of bio_advance made it much more likely to be a problem.

2/ When preparing some blocks for sync, we don't set BIO_UPTODATE
   except on bios that we schedule for a read.  This ensures that
   missing/failed devices don't confuse the loop at the top of
   sync_request write.
   Commit 8be185f2c9d54d6 "raid10: Use bio_reset()"
   removed a loop which set BIO_UPTDATE on all appropriate bios.
   So we need to re-add that flag.

These bugs were introduced in 3.10, so this patch is suitable for
3.10-stable, and can remove a potential for data corruption.
