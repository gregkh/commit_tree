clk/zynq/clkc: Add CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag to ethernet muxes

Zynq's Ethernet clocks are created by the following hierarchy:
	mux0 ---> div0 ---> div1 ---> mux1 ---> gate
Rate change requests on the gate have to propagate all the way up to
div0 to properly leverage all dividers. Mux1 was missing the
CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag, which is required to achieve this.

This does not fix a specific regression but the clock driver was merged
for 3.11-rc1, so best to fix the known bugs before the release.
