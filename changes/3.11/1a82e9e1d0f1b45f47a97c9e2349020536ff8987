ipc/sem: separate wait-for-zero and alter tasks into seperate queues

Introduce separate queues for operations that do not modify the
semaphore values.  Advantages:

 - Simpler logic in check_restart().
 - Faster update_queue(): Right now, all wait-for-zero operations are
   always tested, even if the semaphore value is not 0.
 - wait-for-zero gets again priority, as in linux <=3.0.9
