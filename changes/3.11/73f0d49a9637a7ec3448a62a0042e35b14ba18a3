blk-throttle: move bio_lists[] and friends to throtl_service_queue

throtl_service_queues will eventually form a tree which is anchored at
throtl_data->service_queue and queue bios will climb the tree to the
top service_queue to be executed.

This patch moves bio_lists[] and nr_queued[] from throtl_grp to its
service_queue to prepare for that.  As currently only the
throtl_data->service_queue is in use, this patch just ends up moving
throtl_grp->bio_lists[] and ->nr_queued[] to
throtl_grp->service_queue.bio_lists[] and ->nr_queued[] without making
any functional differences.
