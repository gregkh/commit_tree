jbd2: fix duplicate debug label for phase 2

Currently we see this output:

  $git grep phase fs/jbd2
  fs/jbd2/commit.c:       jbd_debug(3, "JBD2: commit phase 1\n");
  fs/jbd2/commit.c:       jbd_debug(3, "JBD2: commit phase 2\n");
  fs/jbd2/commit.c:       jbd_debug(3, "JBD2: commit phase 2\n");
  fs/jbd2/commit.c:       jbd_debug(3, "JBD2: commit phase 3\n");
  fs/jbd2/commit.c:       jbd_debug(3, "JBD2: commit phase 4\n");
  [...]

There is clearly a duplicate label for phase 2, and they are
both active (i.e. not in #if ... #else block).  Rename them to
be "2a" and "2b" so the debug output is unambiguous.
