NFC: pn544: Identify Type F NFC-DEP through NFCID2

NFCID2 is defined as the first 2 manufacturer ID (IDm) bytes.
NFC DEP (NFC peer to peer) devices Type-F NFCID2 must start with
0x01fe according to the NFC Digital Specification.
By checking those first 2 bytes we send the right command either to the
reader gate when NFCID2 != 0x1fe (The NFC tag case) or to the NFCIP1 gate
when seeing an NFC DEP device (The NFC peer to peer case).

Without this fix, Felica (Type F) tags are not properly detected with this
driver.
