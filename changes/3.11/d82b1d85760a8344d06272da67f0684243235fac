mm, vmalloc: only call setup_vmalloc_vm() only in __get_vm_area_node()

Now for insert_vmalloc_vm, it only calls the two functions:

 - setup_vmalloc_vm: fill vm_struct and vmap_area instances
 - clear_vm_unlist: clear VM_UNLIST bit in vm_struct->flags

So in __get_vm_area_node(), if VM_UNLIST bit unset in flags, that is the
else branch here, we don't need to clear VM_UNLIST bit for vm->flags since
this bit is obviously not set.  That is to say, we could only call
setup_vmalloc_vm instead of insert_vmalloc_vm here.  And then we could
even remove the if test here.
