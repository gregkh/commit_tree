KVM: x86: Remove support for reporting coalesced APIC IRQs

Since the arrival of posted interrupt support we can no longer guarantee
that coalesced IRQs are always reported to the IRQ source. Moreover,
accumulated APIC timer events could cause a busy loop when a VCPU should
rather be halted. The consensus is to remove coalesced tracking from the
LAPIC.
