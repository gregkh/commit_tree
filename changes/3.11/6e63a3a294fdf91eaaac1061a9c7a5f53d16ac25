watchdog: delete mpcore_wdt driver

Interrupt request doesn't use the right API: The TWD watchdog uses a per-cpu
interrupt (usually interrupt #30), and the GIC configuration should flag it as
such. With this setup, request_irq() should fail, and the right API is
request_percpu_irq(), together with enable_percpu_irq()/disable_percpu_irq().

Nothing ensures the userspace ioctl() will end-up kicking the watchdog on the
right CPU.

There are no users of this driver since a long time and it makes more sense to
get rid of it as nobody is looking to fix it.

In case somebody wakes up after this has been removed and needs it, please
revert this driver and pick these updates (These were never pushed to mainline):
