drm/gem: Split drm_gem_mmap() into object search and object mapping

The drm_gem_mmap() function first finds the GEM object to be mapped
based on the fake mmap offset and then maps the object. Split the object
mapping code into a standalone drm_gem_mmap_obj() function that can be
used to implement dma-buf mmap() operations.
