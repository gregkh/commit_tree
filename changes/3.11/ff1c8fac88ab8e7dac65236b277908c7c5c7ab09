init: remove permanent string buffer from do_one_initcall()

do_one_initcall() uses a 64 byte string buffer to save a message. This
buffer is declared static and is only used at boot up and when a module
is loaded. As 64 bytes is very small, and this function has very limited
scope, there's no reason to waste permanent memory with this string and
not just simply put it on the stack.
