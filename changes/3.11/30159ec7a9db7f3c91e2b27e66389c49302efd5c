cgroup: implement for_each_[builtin_]subsys()

There are quite a few places where all loaded [builtin] subsys are
iterated.  Implement for_each_[builtin_]subsys() and replace manual
iterations with those to simplify those places a bit.  The new
iterators automatically skip NULL subsystems.  This shouldn't cause
any functional difference.

Iteration loops which scan all subsystems and then skipping modular
ones explicitly are converted to use for_each_builtin_subsys().

While at it, reorder variable declarations and adjust whitespaces a
bit in the affected functions.

v2: Add lockdep_assert_held() in for_each_subsys() and add comments
    about synchronization as suggested by Li.
