ALSA: usb-audio: fix regression for fixed stream quirk

Commit 8f898e92aea2c24c7f379ee265d178f69ebb9c07 removed the redundant
reads of bInterfaceProtocol from the descriptors, but introduced a
regression to devices with quirks of type QUIRK_AUDIO_FIXED_ENDPOINT,
since fp->protocol is not set in setup process.

As a consequence, audio streams would not get initialized, as the
following logs show:

[   48.923043] setting usb interface 3:1
[   48.923056] Creating new capture data endpoint #81
[   48.923484] 4:3:1: cannot set freq 48000 to ep 0x81

This patch sets fp->protocol in create_fixed_stream_quirk() and
resolves the regression.
