serial: omap: repair building without PM_SLEEP

A recent bug fix in 3.10, ddd85e225c "serial: omap: prevent runtime PM for
"no_console_suspend"", introduced a regression from an obvious typo:

drivers/tty/serial/omap-serial.c:1677:14: error: 'serial_omap_complete'
	undeclared here (not in a function)

This changes the incorrectly added macro to the one that we need instead.
