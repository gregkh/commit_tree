memcg: don't use mem_cgroup_get() when creating a kmemcg cache

Use css_get()/css_put() instead of mem_cgroup_get()/mem_cgroup_put().

There are two things being done in the current code:

First, we acquired a css_ref to make sure that the underlying cgroup
would not go away.  That is a short lived reference, and it is put as
soon as the cache is created.

At this point, we acquire a long-lived per-cache memcg reference count
to guarantee that the memcg will still be alive.

so it is:

  enqueue: css_get
  create : memcg_get, css_put
  destroy: memcg_put

So we only need to get rid of the memcg_get, change the memcg_put to
css_put, and get rid of the now extra css_put.
