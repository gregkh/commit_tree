staging: drm/imx: set correct sync pins for display

partial fix of changes from
"staging: drm/imx: Add support for VGA via TVE on i.MX53"

Have to call imx_drm_crtc_panel_format_pins in imx_drm_crtc_panel_format
with the correct pins instead of (0, 0) This enables configuration of
correct waveforms for vsync / hsync for parallel display, LDB (i.MX53 and
i.MX6) as well as HDMI and MIPI (i.MX6)
