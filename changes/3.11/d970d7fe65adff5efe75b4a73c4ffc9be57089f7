serial/mxs-auart: fix race condition in interrupt handler

The handler needs to ack the pending events before actually handling them.
Otherwise a new event might come in after it it considered non-pending or
handled and is acked then without being handled. So this event is only
noticed when the next interrupt happens.

Without this patch an i.MX28 based machine running an rt-patched kernel
regularly hangs during boot.
