drm/i915: Only slightly increment hangcheck score if we succesfully kick a ring

After kicking a ring, it should be free to make progress again and so
should not be accused of being stuck until hangcheck fires once more. In
order to catch a denial-of-service within a batch or across multiple
batches, we still do increment the hangcheck score - just not as
severely so that it takes multiple kicks to fail.

This should address part of Ben's justified criticism of

    drm/i915: detect hang using per ring hangcheck_score

"There's also another corner case on the kick. If the seqno = 2
(though not stuck), and on the 3rd hangcheck, the ring is stuck, and
we try to kick it... we don't actually try to find out if the kick
helped."

v2: Make sure we catch DoS attempts with batches full of invalid WAITs.
v3: Preserve the ability to detect loops by always charging the ring
    if it is busy on the same request.
v4: Make sure we queue another check if on a new batch
