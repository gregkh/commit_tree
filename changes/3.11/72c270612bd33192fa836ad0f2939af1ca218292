bcache: Write out full stripes

Now that we're tracking dirty data per stripe, we can add two
optimizations for raid5/6:

 * If a stripe is already dirty, force writes to that stripe to
   writeback mode - to help build up full stripes of dirty data

 * When flushing dirty data, preferentially write out full stripes first
   if there are any.
