ARM: KVM: get rid of S2_PGD_SIZE

S2_PGD_SIZE defines the number of pages used by a stage-2 PGD
and is unused, except for a VM_BUG_ON check that missuses the
define.

As the check is very unlikely to ever triggered except in
circumstances where KVM is the least of our worries, just kill
both the define and the VM_BUG_ON check.
