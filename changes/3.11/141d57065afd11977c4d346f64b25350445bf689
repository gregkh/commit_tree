Bluetooth: Fix EBUSY condition test in l2cap_chan_connect

The current test in l2cap_chan_connect is intended to protect against
multiple conflicting connect attempts. However, it assumes that there
will ever only be a single CID that is connected to, which is not true.
We do need to check for conflicts with connect attempts to the same
destination CID but this check is not in anyway specific to LE but can
be applied to BR/EDR as well.
