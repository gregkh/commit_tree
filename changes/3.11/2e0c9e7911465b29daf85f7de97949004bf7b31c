net: sctp: sctp_association_init: put refs in reverse order

In case we need to bail out for whatever reason during assoc
init, we call sctp_endpoint_put() and then sock_put(), however,
we've hold both refs in reverse, non-symmetric order, so first
sctp_endpoint_hold() and then sock_hold().

Reverse this, so that in an error case we have sock_put() and then
sctp_endpoint_put(). Actually shouldn't matter too much, since both
cleanup paths do the right thing, but that way, it is more consistent
with the rest of the code.
