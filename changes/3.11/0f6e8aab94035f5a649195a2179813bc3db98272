staging: for dgrp, let nd_ps_desc always NUL terminated string within MAX_DESC_LEN length

Use strlcpy instead of strncpy to let nd_ps_desc always NUL terminated.

Change nd_ps_desc in nd_struct struct to MAX_DESC_LEN to avoid the
confusion (the related length checking also need be changed to
MAX_DESC_LEN - 1).
