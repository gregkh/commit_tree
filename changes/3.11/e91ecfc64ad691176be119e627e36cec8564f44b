batman-adv: Move call to batadv_nc_skb_forward() from routing.c to send.c

The call to batadv_nc_skb_forward() fits better in
batadv_send_skb_to_orig(), as this is where the actual next hop is
looked up.

To let the caller of batadv_send_skb_to_orig() know wether the skb is
transmitted, buffered or failed, the return value is changed from
boolean to int.
