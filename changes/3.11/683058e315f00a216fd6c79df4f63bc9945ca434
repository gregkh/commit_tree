ACPI / hotplug: Use device offline/online for graceful hot-removal

Modify the generic ACPI hotplug code to be able to check if devices
scheduled for hot-removal may be gracefully removed from the system
using the device offline/online mechanism introduced previously.

Namely, make acpi_scan_hot_remove() handling device hot-removal call
device_offline() for all physical companions of the ACPI device nodes
involved in the operation and check the results.  If any of the
device_offline() calls fails, the function will not progress to the
removal phase (which cannot be aborted), unless its (new) force
argument is set (in case of a failing offline it will put the devices
offlined by it back online).

In support of 'forced' device hot-removal, add a new sysfs attribute
'force_remove' that will reside under /sys/firmware/acpi/hotplug/.
