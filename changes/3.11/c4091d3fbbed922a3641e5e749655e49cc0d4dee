MIPS: BMIPS: do not change interrupt routing depending on boot CPU

Commit 4df715aa ("MIPS: BMIPS: support booting from physical CPU other
than 0") changed the interupt routing when we are booting from physical
CPU 0, but the settings are actually correct if we are booting from
physical CPU 0 or CPU 1. Revert that specific change.
