ARM: EXYNOS: Remove legacy dev- and setup- files

This patch removes now unused files containing old device and GPIO setup
code that was needed for ATAGS based boot, which is not supported on
Exynos any more.

The only exception is setup-i2c0.c that will be removed later, since it
has dependencies in plat-samsung/ directory.
