cpufreq: Fix serialization of frequency transitions

Commit 7c30ed ("cpufreq: make sure frequency transitions are serialized")
interacts poorly with systems that have a single core freqency for all
cores.  On such systems we have a single policy for all cores with
several CPUs.  When we do a frequency transition the governor calls the
pre and post change notifiers which causes cpufreq_notify_transition()
per CPU.  Since the policy is the same for all of them all CPUs after
the first and the warnings added are generated by checking a per-policy
flag the warnings will be triggered for all cores after the first.

Fix this by allowing notifier to be called for n times. Where n is the number of
cpus in policy->cpus.
