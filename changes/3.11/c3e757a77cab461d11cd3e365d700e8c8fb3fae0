ARC: [tlb-miss] Extraneous PTE bit testing/setting

* No need to check for READ access in I-TLB Miss handler

* Redundant PAGE_PRESENT update in PTE

Post TLB entry installation, in updating PTE for software accessed/dity
bits, no need to update PAGE_PRESENT since it will already be set.
Infact the entry won't have installed if !PAGE_PRESENT.
