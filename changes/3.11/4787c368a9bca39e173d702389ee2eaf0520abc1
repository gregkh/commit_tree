x86/tracing: Add irq_enter/exit() in smp_trace_reschedule_interrupt()

Reschedule vector tracepoints may be called in cpu idle state.
This causes lockdep check warning below.

The tracepoint requires rcu but for accuracy it also
requires irq_enter() (tracepoints record the irq context), thus,
the tracepoint interrupt handler should be calling irq_enter()
and not rcu_irq_enter() (irq_enter() calls rcu_irq_enter()).

So, add irq_enter/exit() to smp_trace_reschedule_interrupt()
with common pre/post processing functions, smp_entering_irq()
and exiting_irq() (exiting_irq() calls just irq_exit()
 in arch/x86/include/asm/apic.h),
because these can be shared among reschedule, call_function,
and call_function_single vectors.
