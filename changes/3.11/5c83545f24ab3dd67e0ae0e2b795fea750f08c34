[zoran.markovic@linaro.org: Re-formatted suspend time table to better
fit expected values. Moved accounting of suspend time into timekeeping
core. Removed CONFIG_SUSPEND_TIME flag and made the feature conditional
on CONFIG_DEBUG_FS. Changed the file name to sleep_time to better fit
terminology in timekeeping core. Changed seq_printf to seq_puts. Tweaked
