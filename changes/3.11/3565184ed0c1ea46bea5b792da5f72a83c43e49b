x86: Increase precision of x86_platform.get/set_wallclock()

All the virtualized platforms (KVM, lguest and Xen) have persistent
wallclocks that have more than one second of precision.

read_persistent_wallclock() and update_persistent_wallclock() allow
for nanosecond precision but their implementation on x86 with
x86_platform.get/set_wallclock() only allows for one second precision.
This means guests may see a wallclock time that is off by up to 1
second.

Make set_wallclock() and get_wallclock() take a struct timespec
parameter (which allows for nanosecond precision) so KVM and Xen
guests may start with a more accurate wallclock time and a Xen dom0
can maintain a more accurate wallclock for guests.
