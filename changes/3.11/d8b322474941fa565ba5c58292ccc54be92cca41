drm/i915: use pipe_config for lvds dithering

Up to now we've relied on the bios to get this right for us. Let's try
out whether our code has improved a bit, since we should dither
always when the output bpp doesn't match the plane bpp.
- gen5+ should be fine, since we only use the bios hint as an upgrade.
- gen4 changes, since here dithering is still controlled in the lvds
  register.
- gen2/3 has implicit dithering depeding upon whether you use 2 or 3
  lvds pairs (which makes sense, since it only supports 8bpc pipe
  outpu configurations).
- hsw doesn't support lvds.

v2: Remove redudant dither setting.

v3: Completly drop reliance on dev_priv->lvds_dither.

v4: Enable dithering on gen2/3 only when we have a 18bpp panel, since
up-dithering to a 24bpp panel is not supported by the hw. Spotted by
Ville.

v5: Also only enable lvds port dithering on gen4 for 18bpp modes. In
practice this only excludes dithering a 10bpc plane down for a 24bpp
lvds panel. Not something we truly care about. Again noticed by Ville.

v6: Actually git add.
