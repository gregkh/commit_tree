FMC: add a software carrier driver

This fake carrier is designed to help FMC users understand how a
carrier driver works, and to experiment the behaviour with EEPROM
reprogramming (with a mezzanine driver commited later). This carrier
can register up to 4 (fake) mezzanines.

We have real carriers (both on PCI-E and VME), but they are bigger
things and are not part of this submission.
