tipc: convert config_lock from spinlock to mutex

As the configuration server is now running under process context,
it's unnecessary for us to have a spinlock serializing the TIPC
configuration process. Instead, we replace it with a mutex lock,
which gives us more freedom. For instance, we can now call
pre-emptable functions within the protected area.
