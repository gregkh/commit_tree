mv643xx_eth.c: convert skb->end into skb_end_poitner(skb)

The change set of 4305b541 "[SK_BUFF]: Convert skb->end to sk_buff_data_t"
converted skb->end from pointer to sk_buff_data_t.
The pointed value should be accessed via skb_end_pointer().

Since arm or ppc arch doesn't define NET_SKBUFF_DATA_USES_OFFSET,
skb->end is effectively pointer. So it doesn't cause a real problem.
But this patch is good for consistency.

Found by inspection. Compile test only.
