memcg: get rid of swapaccount leftovers

The swapaccount kernel parameter without any values has been removed by
commit a2c8990aed5a ("memsw: remove noswapaccount kernel parameter") but
it seems that we didn't get rid of all the left overs.

Make sure that menuconfig help text and kernel-parameters.txt are clear
about value for the paramter and remove the stalled comment which is not
very much useful on its own.
