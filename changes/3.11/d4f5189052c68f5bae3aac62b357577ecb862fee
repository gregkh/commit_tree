HID: Add support for Holtek gaming mouse 04d9:a04a

This mouse is sold as Tracer Sniper TRM-503, NOVA Gaming Slider X200 and
Zalman ZM-GM1, and reports too high usage maximum and logical maximum
(like 04d9:a067, but its report descriptor is different). This patch
adds its USB ID and fixes the report descriptor in the same way.

Note: I don't actually have such a mouse to test, I took the report
descriptor posted at https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=774676,
compared it to the one from 04d9:a067 and changed the offsets
accordingly (all numbers minus 9, since it is 9 bytes shorter, and the
difference is before the values that need changing). That Surely Worksâ„¢.
