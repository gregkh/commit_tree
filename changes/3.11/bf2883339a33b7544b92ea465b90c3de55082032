pstore: Fail to unlink if a driver has not defined pstore_erase

pstore_erase is used to erase the record from the persistent store.
So if a driver has not defined pstore_erase callback return
-EPERM instead of unlinking a file as deleting the file without
erasing its record in persistent store will give a wrong impression
to customers.
