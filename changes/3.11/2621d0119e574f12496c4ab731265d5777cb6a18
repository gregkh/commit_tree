USB: OHCI: Generic changes to make ohci-pci a separate driver

Note that this changes is part of separating the ohci pci host controller
driver from ohci-hcd host code.
This contains :
     -Moved sb800_prefetch() function from ohci-pci.c to pci-quirks.c file
      and EXPORTed, this is part of the effort to move the ohci pci related
      code to generic pci code.
     -Passed "device" argument instead  of "ohci_hcd" in sb800_prefetch()
      function to avoid extra include file in pci-quirks.c.

V2:
     -Passed "device" argment instead of "pci_dev", then we use to_pci_dev()
      to get the "pci_dev" structure.
