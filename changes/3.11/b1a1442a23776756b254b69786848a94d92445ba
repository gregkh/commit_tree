HID: core: fix reporting of raw events

hdrw->raw event can return three different return value types:

- ret < 0	indicates that the hdrv driver found an error while parsing
- ret == 0	indicates no error has been encountered, and the driver has
          	processed the report
- ret > 0	indicates that there was no parsing error, and the driver hasn't
		processed the event.

Calling hid_report_raw_event() has to be called appropriately so that it
reflects what has been done by ->raw_event() callback, otherwise we might
updates of the in-kernel structure are lost upon arrival of the report, which
is wrong.
