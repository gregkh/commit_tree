Smack: Add smkfstransmute mount option

Suppliment the smkfsroot mount option with another, smkfstransmute,
that does the same thing but also marks the root inode as
transmutting. This allows a freshly created filesystem to
be mounted with a transmutting heirarchy.

Targeted for git://git.gitorious.org/smack-next/kernel.git
