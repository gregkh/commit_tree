ARM: shmobile: armadillo800eva: Don't request GPIO 166 in board code

89ae7b5bbd3e65bc6ab7a577ca5ec18569589c8c
(ARM: shmobile: armadillo800eva: Register pinctrl mapping for INTC)
mistakenly requests GPIO 166 in board code,
most probably due to a wrong merge conflict resolution.
As the GPIO is passed to the st1232 driver through platform
data and requested by the driver,
there's no need to request it in board code. Fix it.
