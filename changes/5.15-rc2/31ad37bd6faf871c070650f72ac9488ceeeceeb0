Revert "drm/vc4: hdmi: Remove drm_encoder->crtc usage"

This reverts commit 27da370e0fb343a0baf308f503bb3e5dcdfe3362.

Sudip Mukherjee reports that this broke pulseaudio with a NULL pointer
dereference in vc4_hdmi_audio_prepare(), bisected it to this commit, and
confirmed that a revert fixed the problem.

Revert the problematic commit until fixed.
