alpha: enable GENERIC_PCI_IOMAP unconditionally

With the previous commit (9caea0007601: "parisc: Declare pci_iounmap()
parisc version only when CONFIG_PCI enabled") we can now enable
GENERIC_PCI_IOMAP unconditionally on alpha, and if PCI is not enabled we
will just get the nice empty helper functions that allow mixed-bus
drivers to build.

Example driver: the old 3com/3c59x.c driver works with either the PCI or
the EISA version of the 3x59x card, but wouldn't build in an EISA-only
configuration because of missing pci_iomap() and pci_iounmap() dummy
wrappers.

Most of the other PCI infrastructure just becomes empty wrappers even
without GENERIC_PCI_IOMAP, and it's not obvious that the pci_iomap
functionality shouldn't do the same, but this works.
