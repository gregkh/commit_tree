drm/etnaviv: put submit prev MMU context when it exists

The prev context is the MMU context at the time of the job
queueing in hardware. As a job might be queued multiple times
due to recovery after a GPU hang, we need to make sure to put
the stale prev MMU context from a prior queuing, to avoid the
reference and thus the MMU context leaking.
