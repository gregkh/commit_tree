drm/dbi: Print errors for mipi_dbi_command()

The macro mipi_dbi_command() does not report errors unless you wrap it
in another macro to do the error reporting.

Report a rate-limited error so we know what is going on.

After this any code wishing to send command arrays can rely on
mipi_dbi_command() providing an appropriate error message if something
goes wrong.
