tools: Replace btf__get_from_id() with btf__load_from_kernel_by_id()

Replace the calls to function btf__get_from_id(), which we plan to
deprecate before the library reaches v1.0, with calls to
btf__load_from_kernel_by_id() in tools/ (bpftool, perf, selftests).
Update the surrounding code accordingly (instead of passing a pointer to
the btf struct, get it as a return value from the function).
