crypto: omap-sham - drop pm_runtime_irqsafe() usage

Commit b0a3d8986a76 ("crypto: omap-sham - Use pm_runtime_irq_safe()") added
the use of pm_runtime_irq_safe() as pm_runtime_get_sync() was called
from a tasklet.

We now use the crypto engine queue instead of a custom queue since
commit 33c3d434d91 ("crypto: omap-sham - convert to use crypto engine").

We want to drop the use of pm_runtime_irq_safe() in general as it takes a
permanent usage count on the parent device causing issues for power
management.

Based on testing with CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y, modprobe omap-sham,
followed by modprobe tcrypt sec=1 mode=423, I have not been able to
reproduce the scheduling while atomic issue seen earlier with current
kernels and we can just drop the call to pm_runtime_irq_safe().
