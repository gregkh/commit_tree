HID: wacom: set initial hardware touch switch state to 'off'

Wacom touch devices have two types of touch switches: softkey touch
toggle and hardware touch switch. For softkey toggle, we assume
touch is on by default in the driver. However the hardware touch
switch is controlled by end users. We don't know if it's on or off
before getting the status event.

This patch sets touch off for devices with a hardware switch until we
get the status. This is a bit safer for users who leave the switch "off"
and don't want any accidental touches. The tradeoff is a slight delay
between device connection and touch becoming enabled for users who
leave the switch "on".
