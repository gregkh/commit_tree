KVM: arm64: Trim guest debug exception handling

The switch-case for handling guest debug exception covers
all the debug exception classes, but functionally, doesn't
do anything with them other than ESR_ELx_EC_WATCHPT_LOW.
Moreover, even though handled well, the 'default' case
could be confusing from a security point of view, stating
that the guests' actions can potentially flood the syslog.
But in reality, the code is unreachable.

Hence, trim down the function to only handle the case with
ESR_ELx_EC_WATCHPT_LOW with a simple 'if' check.
