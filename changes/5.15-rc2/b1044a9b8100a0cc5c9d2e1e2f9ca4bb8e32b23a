Revert drm/vc4 hdmi runtime PM changes

This reverts commits

  9984d6664ce9 ("drm/vc4: hdmi: Make sure the controller is powered in detect")
  411efa18e4b0 ("drm/vc4: hdmi: Move the HSM clock enable to runtime_pm")

as Michael Stapelberg reports that the new runtime PM changes cause his
Raspberry Pi 3 to hang on boot, probably due to interactions with other
changes in the DRM tree (because a bisect points to the merge in commit
e058a84bfddc: "Merge tag 'drm-next-2021-07-01' of git://.../drm").

Revert these two commits until it's been resolved.
