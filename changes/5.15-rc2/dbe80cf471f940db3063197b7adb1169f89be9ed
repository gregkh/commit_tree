watchdog: Start watchdog in watchdog_set_last_hw_keepalive only if appropriate

We must not pet a running watchdog when handle_boot_enabled is off
because this will kick off automatic triggering before userland is
running, defeating the purpose of the handle_boot_enabled control.
Furthermore, don't ping in case watchdog_set_last_hw_keepalive was
called incorrectly when the hardware watchdog is actually not running.
