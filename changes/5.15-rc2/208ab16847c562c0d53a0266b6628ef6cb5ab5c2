x86/resctrl: Label the resources with their configuration type

The names of resources are used for the schema name presented to
user-space. The name used is rooted in a structure provided by the
architecture code because the names are different when CDP is enabled.
x86 implements this by swapping between two sets of resource structures
based on their alloc_enabled flag. The type of configuration in-use is
encoded in the name (and cbm_idx_offset).

Once the CDP behaviour is moved into the parts of resctrl that will
move to /fs/, there will be two struct resctrl_schema for one struct
rdt_resource. The schema describes the type of configuration being
applied to the resource. The name of the schema should be generated
by resctrl, base on the type of configuration. To do this struct
resctrl_schema needs to store the type of configuration in use for a
schema.

Create an enum resctrl_conf_type describing the options, and add it to
struct resctrl_schema. The underlying resources are still separate, as
cbm_idx_offset is still in use.

Temporarily label all the entries in rdt_resources_all[] and copy that
value to struct resctrl_schema. Copying the value ensures there is no
mismatch while the filesystem parts of resctrl are modified to use the
schema. Once the resources are merged, the filesystem code can assign
this value based on the schema being created.
