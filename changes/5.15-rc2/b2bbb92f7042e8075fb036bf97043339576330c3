ext4: fix e2fsprogs checksum failure for mounted filesystem

Commit 81414b4dd48 ("ext4: remove redundant sb checksum
recomputation") removed checksum recalculation after updating
superblock free space / inode counters in ext4_fill_super() based on
the fact that we will recalculate the checksum on superblock
writeout.

That is correct assumption but until the writeout happens (which can
take a long time) the checksum is incorrect in the buffer cache and if
programs such as tune2fs or resize2fs is called shortly after a file
system is mounted can fail.  So return back the checksum recalculation
and add a comment explaining why.
