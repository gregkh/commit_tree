ext4: remove an unnecessary if statement in __ext4_get_inode_loc()

The "if (!buffer_uptodate(bh))" hunk covered almost the whole code after
getting buffer in __ext4_get_inode_loc() which seems unnecessary, remove
it and switch to check ext4_buffer_uptodate(), it simplify code and make
it more readable.
