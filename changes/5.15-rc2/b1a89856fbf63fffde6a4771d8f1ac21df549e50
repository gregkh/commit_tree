m68k: Double cast io functions to unsigned long

m68k builds fail widely with errors such as

arch/m68k/include/asm/raw_io.h:20:19: error:
	cast to pointer from integer of different size
arch/m68k/include/asm/raw_io.h:30:32: error:
	cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-p

On m68k, io functions are defined as macros. The problem is seen if the
macro parameter variable size differs from the size of a pointer. Cast
the parameter of all io macros to unsigned long before casting it to
a pointer to fix the problem.
