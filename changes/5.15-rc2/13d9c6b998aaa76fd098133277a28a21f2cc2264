ALSA: hda/realtek: Workaround for conflicting SSID on ASUS ROG Strix G17

ASUS ROG Strix G17 has the very same PCI and codec SSID (1043:103f) as
ASUS TX300, and unfortunately, the existing quirk for TX300 is broken
on ASUS ROG.  Actually the device works without the quirk, so we'll
need to clear the quirk before applying for this device.
Since ASUS ROG has a different codec (ALC294 - while TX300 has
ALC282), this patch adds a workaround for the device, just clearing
the codec->fixup_id by checking the codec vendor_id.

It's a bit ugly to add such a workaround there, but it seems to be the
simplest way.
