soundwire: intel: fix potential race condition during power down

The power down sequence sets the link_up flag as false outside of the
mutex_lock. This is potentially unsafe.

In additional the flow in that sequence can be improved by first
testing if the link was powered, setting the link_up flag as false and
proceeding with the power down. In case the CPA bits cannot be
cleared, we only flag an error since we cannot deal with interrupts
any longer.
