net/mlx5e: Fix mutual exclusion between CQE compression and HW TS

Some profiles of the driver don't support a dedicated PTP-RQ, hence can't
support HW TS and CQE compression simultaneously. When HW TS is enabled
the COE compression is disabled, and should be restored when the HW TS
is turned off. Add rx_filter as an input to modifying CQE compression to
enforce this restriction.
