swiotlb: Emit diagnostic in swiotlb_exit()

A recent debugging session would have been made a little bit easier if
we had noticed sooner that swiotlb_exit() was being called during boot.

Add a simple diagnostic message to swiotlb_exit() to complement the one
from swiotlb_print_info() during initialisation.
