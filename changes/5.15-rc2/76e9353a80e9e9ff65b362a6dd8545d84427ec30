can: rcar_canfd: Add support for RZ/G2L family

CANFD block on RZ/G2L SoC is almost identical to one found on
R-Car Gen3 SoC's. On RZ/G2L SoC interrupt sources for each channel
are split into different sources and the IP doesn't divide (1/2)
CANFD clock within the IP.

This patch adds compatible string for RZ/G2L family and splits
the irq handlers to accommodate both RZ/G2L and R-Car Gen3 SoC's.
