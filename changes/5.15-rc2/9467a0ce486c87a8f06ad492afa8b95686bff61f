ndr: fix translation in ndr_encode_posix_acl()

The sid_to_id() helper encodes raw ownership information suitable for
s*id handling. This is conceptually equivalent to reporting ownership
information via stat to userspace. In this case the consumer is ksmbd
instead of a regular user. So when encoding raw ownership information
suitable for s*id handling later we need to map the id up according to
the user namespace of ksmbd itself taking any idmapped mounts into
account.
