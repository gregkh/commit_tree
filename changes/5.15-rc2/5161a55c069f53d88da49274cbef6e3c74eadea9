cxl: Move cxl_core to new directory

CXL core is growing, and it's already arguably unmanageable. To support
future growth, move core functionality to a new directory and rename the
file to represent just bus support. Future work will remove non-bus
functionality.

Note that mem.h is renamed to cxlmem.h to avoid a namespace collision
with the global ARCH=um mem.h header.
