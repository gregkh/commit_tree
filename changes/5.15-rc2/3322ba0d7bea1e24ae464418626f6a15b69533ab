s390: make PCI mio support a machine flag

Kernel support for the newer PCI mio instructions can be toggled off
with the pci=nomio command line option which needs to integrate with
common code PCI option parsing. However this option then toggles static
branches which can't be toggled yet in an early_param() call.

Thus commit 9964f396f1d0 ("s390: fix setting of mio addressing control")
moved toggling the static branches to the PCI init routine.

With this setup however we can't check for mio support outside the PCI
code during early boot, i.e. before switching the static branches, which
we need to be able to export this as an ELF HWCAP.

Improve on this by turning mio availability into a machine flag that
gets initially set based on CONFIG_PCI and the facility bit and gets
toggled off if pci=nomio is found during PCI option parsing allowing
simple access to this machine flag after early init.
