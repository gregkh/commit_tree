rtc: cmos: remove stale REVISIT comments

It appears mc146818_get_time() and mc146818_set_time() now correctly
use the century register as specified in the ACPI FADT table. It is not
clear what else could be done here.

These comments were introduced by
        commit 7be2c7c96aff ("[PATCH] RTC framework driver for CMOS RTCs")
in 2007, which originally referenced function get_rtc_time() in
include/asm-generic/rtc.h .
