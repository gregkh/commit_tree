selftests/bpf: Move netcnt test under test_progs

Rewrite to skel and ASSERT macros as well while we are at it.

v3:
- replace -f with -A to make it work with busybox ping.
  -A is available on both busybox and iputils, from the man page:
  On networks with low RTT this mode is essentially equivalent to
  flood mode.

v2:
- don't check result of bpf_map__fd (Yonghong Song)
- remove from .gitignore (Andrii Nakryiko)
- move ping_command into network_helpers (Andrii Nakryiko)
- remove assert() (Andrii Nakryiko)
