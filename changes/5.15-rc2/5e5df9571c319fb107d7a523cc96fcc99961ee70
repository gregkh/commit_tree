KVM: arm64: Restrict IPA size to maximum 48 bits on 4K and 16K page size

Even though ID_AA64MMFR0.PARANGE reports 52 bit PA size support, it cannot
be enabled as guest IPA size on 4K or 16K page size configurations. Hence
kvm_ipa_limit must be restricted to 48 bits. This change achieves required
IPA capping.

Before the commit c9b69a0cf0b4 ("KVM: arm64: Don't constrain maximum IPA
size based on host configuration"), the problem here would have been just
latent via PHYS_MASK_SHIFT (which earlier in turn capped kvm_ipa_limit),
which remains capped at 48 bits on 4K and 16K configs.
