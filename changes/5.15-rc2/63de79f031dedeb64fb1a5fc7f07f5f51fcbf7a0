net: ipa: use runtime PM core

Use the runtime power management core to cause hardware suspend and
resume to occur.  Enable it in ipa_clock_init() (without autosuspend),
and disable it in ipa_clock_exit().

Use ipa_runtime_suspend() as the ->runtime_suspend power operation,
and arrange for it to be called by having ipa_clock_get() call
pm_runtime_get_sync() when the first clock reference is taken.
Similarly, use ipa_runtime_resume() as the ->runtime_resume power
operation, and pm_runtime_put() when the last IPA clock reference
is dropped.

Introduce ipa_runtime_idle() as the ->runtime_idle power operation,
and have it return a non-zero value; this way suspend will never
occur except when forced.

Use pm_runtime_force_suspend() and pm_runtime_force_resume() as the
system suspend and resume callbacks, and remove ipa_suspend() and
ipa_resume().

Store a pointer to the device structure passed to ipa_clock_init(),
so it can be used by ipa_clock_exit() to disable runtime power
management.

For now we preserve IPA clock reference counting.
