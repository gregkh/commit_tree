cifs: Fix race between hole punch and page fault

Cifs has a following race between hole punching and page fault:

CPU1                                            CPU2
smb3_fallocate()
  smb3_punch_hole()
    truncate_pagecache_range()
                                                filemap_fault()
                                                  - loads old data into the
                                                    page cache
    SMB2_ioctl(..., FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA, ...)

And now we have stale data in the page cache. Fix the problem by locking
out faults (as well as reads) using mapping->invalidate_lock while hole
punch is running.
