fs/ntfs3: Fix integer overflow in multiplication

The multiplication of the u32 data_size with a int is being performed
using 32 bit arithmetic however the results is being assigned to the
variable nbits that is a size_t (64 bit) value. Fix a potential
integer overflow by casting the u32 value to a size_t before the
multiply to use a size_t sized bit multiply operation.
