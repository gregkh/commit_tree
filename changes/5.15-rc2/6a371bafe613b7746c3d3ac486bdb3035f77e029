perf/x86/amd/ibs: Add bitfield definitions in new <asm/amd-ibs.h> header

Add <asm/amd-ibs.h> with bitfield definitions for IBS MSRs,
and demonstrate usage within the driver.

Also move 'struct perf_ibs_data' where it can be shared with
the perf tool that will soon be using it.

No functional changes.
