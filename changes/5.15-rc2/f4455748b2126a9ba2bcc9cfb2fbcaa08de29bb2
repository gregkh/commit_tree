PCI: cadence: Use bitfield for *quirk_retrain_flag* instead of bool

No functional change. As we are intending to add additional 1-bit
members in struct j721e_pcie_data/struct cdns_pcie_rc, use bitfields
instead of bool since it takes less space. As discussed in [1],
the preference is to use bitfileds instead of bool inside structures.
