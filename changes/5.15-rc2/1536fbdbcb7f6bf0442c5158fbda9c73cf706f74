media: ov5640: Complement yuv mbus formats with their 1X16 versions

According to media bus pixel codes definition, data formats on serial
busses should be described with one bus sample per pixel.

Documentation/userspace-api/media/v4l/subdev-formats.rst states:

"The media bus pixel codes document parallel formats. Should the pixel
data be transported over a serial bus, the media bus pixel code that
describes a parallel format that transfers a sample on a single clock
cycle is used. For instance, both MEDIA_BUS_FMT_BGR888_1X24 and
MEDIA_BUS_FMT_BGR888_3X8 are used on parallel busses for transferring an
8 bits per sample BGR data, whereas on serial busses the data in this
format is only referred to using MEDIA_BUS_FMT_BGR888_1X24. This is
because there is effectively only a single way to transport that
format on the serial busses."

Some MIPI CSI receivers strictly obey this definition and declare
support for only *1X_* formats.

Hence, complement the supported media bus formats with their 1X16 versions
(currently applicable to yuyv, uyvy) to enhance interoperability with CSI
receivers.
