ARM: dts: am335x-baltos: switch to new cpsw switch drv

The dual_mac mode has been preserved the same way between legacy and new
driver, and one port devices works the same as 1 dual_mac port - it's safe
to switch drivers.

So, switch OnRISC Baltos and NetCom/Cam boards to use new cpsw switch
driver. Those boards have or 2 Ext. port wired and configured in dual_mac
mode by default, or only 1 Ext. port.
