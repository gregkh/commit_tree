mptcp: handle pending data on closed subflow

The PM can close active subflow, e.g. due to ingress RM_ADDR
option. Such subflow could carry data still unacked at the
MPTCP-level, both in the write and the rtx_queue, which has
never reached the other peer.

Currently the mptcp-level retransmission will deliver such data,
but at a very low rate (at most 1 DSM for each MPTCP rtx interval).

We can speed-up the recovery a lot, moving all the unacked in the
tcp write_queue, so that it will be pushed again via other
subflows, at the speed allowed by them.

Also make available the new helper for later patches.
