nvme-tcp: Do not reset transport on data digest errors

The spec says

  7.4.6.1 Digest Error handling

  When a host detects a data digest error in a C2HData PDU, that host
  shall continue processing C2HData PDUs associated with the command and
  when the command processing has completed, if a successful status was
  returned by the controller, the host shall fail the command with a
  non-fatal transport error.

Currently the transport is reseted when a data digest error is
detected. Instead, when a digest error is detected, mark the final
status as NVME_SC_DATA_XFER_ERROR and let the upper layer handle
the error.

In order to keep track of the final result maintain a status field in
nvme_tcp_request object and use it to overwrite the completion queue
status (which might be successful even though a digest error has been
detected) when completing the request.
