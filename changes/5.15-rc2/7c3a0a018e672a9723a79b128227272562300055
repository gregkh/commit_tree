net/{mlx5|nfp|bnxt}: Remove unnecessary RTNL lock assert

Remove the assert from the callback priv lookup function since it does
not require RTNL lock and is already protected by flow_indr_block_lock.

This will avoid warnings from being emitted to dmesg if the driver
registers its callback after an ingress qdisc was created for a
netdevice.

The warnings started after the following patch was merged:
commit 74fc4f828769 ("net: Fix offloading indirect devices dependency on qdisc order creation")
