x86: remove cc-option-yn test for -mtune=

As noted in the comment, -mtune= has been supported since GCC 3.4. The
minimum required version of GCC to build the kernel (as specified in
Documentation/process/changes.rst) is GCC 4.9.

tune is not immediately expanded. Instead it defines a macro that will
test via cc-option later values for -mtune=. But we can skip the test
whether to use -mtune= vs. -mcpu=.
