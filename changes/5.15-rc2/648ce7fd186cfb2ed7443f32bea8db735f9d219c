drm/stm: ltdc: Silence -EPROBE_DEFER till bridge attached

As dw-mipi-dsi supported all possible ways to find the DSI
devices. It can take multiple iterations for ltdc to find
all components attached to the DSI bridge.

The current ltdc driver failed to find the endpoint as
it returned -EINVAL for the first iteration itself. This leads
to following error:

[    3.099289] [drm:ltdc_load] *ERROR* init encoder endpoint 0

So, check the return value and cleanup the encoder only if it's
not -EPROBE_DEFER. This make all components in the attached DSI
bridge found properly.
