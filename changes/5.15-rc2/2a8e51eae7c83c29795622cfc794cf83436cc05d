perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Sapphire Rapids server M3UPI support

M3 Intel UPI is the interface between the mesh and the Intel UPI link
layer. It is responsible for translating between the mesh protocol
packets and the flits that are used for transmitting data across the
Intel UPI interface.

The layout of the control registers for a M3UPI uncore unit is similar
to a UPI uncore unit.
