btrfs: remove uptodate parameter from btrfs_dec_test_first_ordered_pending

In commit e65f152e4348 ("btrfs: refactor how we finish ordered extent io
for endio functions") there was last caller not using 1 for the uptodate
parameter. Now there's only one, passing 1, so we can remove it and
simplify the code.
