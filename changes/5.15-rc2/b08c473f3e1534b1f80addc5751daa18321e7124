staging: r8188eu: remove ODM_RT_TRACE calls from hal/odm.c

Remove ODM_RT_TRACE calls from hal/odm.c, as by removing these calls
in this file and others, we can ultimately then remove the macro
definition itself, which does not follow best practice.

Also remove three empty functions and their calls from hal/odm.c, as
they only contained ODM_RT_TRACE calls, and remove the corresponding
include/odm_precomp.h declarations.
