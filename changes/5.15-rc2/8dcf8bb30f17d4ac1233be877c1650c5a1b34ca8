net: ipa: don't stop TX on suspend

Currently we stop the modem netdev transmit queue when suspending
the hardware.  For system suspend this ensured we'd never attempt
to transmit while attempting to suspend the modem endpoints.

For runtime suspend, the IPA hardware might get suspended while the
system is operating.  In that case we want an attempt to transmit a
packet to cause the hardware to resume if necessary.  But if we
disable the queue this cannot happen.

So stop disabling the queue on suspend.  In case we end up disabling
it in ipa_start_xmit() (see the previous commit), we still arrange
to start the TX queue on resume.
