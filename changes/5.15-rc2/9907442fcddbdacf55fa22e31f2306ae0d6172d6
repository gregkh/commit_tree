selftests/bpf: Mute expected invalid map creation error msg

Previously, the newly introduced test case in test_map_in_map(), which
checks whether the inner map is destroyed after unsuccessful creation of
the outer map, logged the following harmless and expected error:

    libbpf: map 'mim': failed to create: Invalid argument(-22) libbpf:
    failed to load object './test_map_in_map_invalid.o'

To avoid any possible confusion, mute the logging during loading of the
prog.
