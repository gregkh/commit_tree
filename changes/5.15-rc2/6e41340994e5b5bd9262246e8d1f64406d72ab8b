ALSA: usb-audio: Move set-interface-first workaround into common quirk

The recent quirk for WALKMAN (commit 7af5a14371c1: "ALSA: usb-audio:
Fix regression on Sony WALKMAN NW-A45 DAC") may be required for other
devices and is worth to be put into the common quirk flags.
This patch adds a new quirk flag bit QUIRK_FLAG_SET_IFACE_FIRST and a
quirk table entry for the device.
