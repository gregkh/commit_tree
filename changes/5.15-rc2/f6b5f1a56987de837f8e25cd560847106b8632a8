compiler.h: Introduce absolute_pointer macro

absolute_pointer() disassociates a pointer from its originating symbol
type and context. Use it to prevent compiler warnings/errors such as

  drivers/net/ethernet/i825xx/82596.c: In function 'i82596_probe':
  arch/m68k/include/asm/string.h:72:25: error:
	'__builtin_memcpy' reading 6 bytes from a region of size 0 [-Werror=stringop-overread]

Such warnings may be reported by gcc 11.x for string and memory
operations on fixed addresses.
