pinctrl: Ingenic: Improve the code.

1.Rename the original "dmicx" ABIs to "dmic-ifx", since these devices
  have only one DMIC module which has multiple input interfaces. The
  original naming is easy to make users mistakenly think that the
  device has multiple dmic modules. Currently, in the mainline, no
  other devicetree out there is using the "sfc" ABI, so we should be
  able to replace it safely.
2.Rename the original "ssix-ce0" ABIs to "ssix-ce", since the X2000
  have only one ce pin. The original naming is easy to make users
  mistakenly think that the device has multiple ce pins. Currently,
  in the mainline, no other devicetree out there is using the
  "ssix-ce0" ABIs, so we should be able to replace it safely.
3.Split the original "sfc" ABI into "sfc-data", "sfc-ce", "sfc-clk"
  to increase the flexibility when configuring the pins. Currently,
  in the mainline, no other devicetree out there is using the "sfc"
  ABI, so we should be able to replace it safely.
4.There is more than one compatible string in the match table, so
  renaming "ingenic_xxxx_of_match[]" to "ingenic_xxxx_of_matches"
  is more reasonable, and remove the unnecessary commas in
  "ingenic_gpio_of_matches[]" to reduce code size as much as possible.
