RDMA/iwpm: Rely on the rdma_nl_[un]register() to ensure that requests are valid

The core netlink code alread guarentees that no netlink callback can be
running outside the rdma_nl_register/unregister() region and this
registration happens during module init/exit. Thus it is already prevented
that iwpm_valid_client() can ever fail. Remove it.
