arm64: dts: marvell: armada-37xx: Extend PCIe MEM space

Current PCIe MEM space of size 16 MB is not enough for some combination
of PCIe cards (e.g. NVMe disk together with ath11k wifi card). ARM Trusted
Firmware for Armada 3700 platform already assigns 128 MB for PCIe window,
so extend PCIe MEM space to the end of 128 MB PCIe window which allows to
allocate more PCIe BARs for more PCIe cards.

Without this change some combination of PCIe cards cannot be used and
kernel show error messages in dmesg during initialization:

    pci 0000:00:00.0: BAR 8: no space for [mem size 0x01800000]
    pci 0000:00:00.0: BAR 8: failed to assign [mem size 0x01800000]
    pci 0000:00:00.0: BAR 6: assigned [mem 0xe8000000-0xe80007ff pref]

    pci 0000:03:00.0: BAR 0: no space for [mem size 0x01000000 64bit]
    pci 0000:03:00.0: BAR 0: failed to assign [mem size 0x01000000 64bit]

Due to bugs in U-Boot port for Turris Mox, the second range in Turris Mox
kernel DTS file for PCIe must start at 16 MB offset. Otherwise U-Boot
crashes during loading of kernel DTB file. This bug is present only in
U-Boot code for Turris Mox and therefore other Armada 3700 devices are not
affected by this bug. Bug is fixed in U-Boot version 2021.07.

To not break booting new kernels on existing versions of U-Boot on Turris
Mox, use first 16 MB range for IO and second range with rest of PCIe window
for MEM.
