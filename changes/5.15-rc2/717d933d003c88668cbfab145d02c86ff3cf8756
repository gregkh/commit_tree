staging: r8188eu: Remove unnecessary parentheses

Clang warns several times across the driver along the lines of:

drivers/staging/r8188eu/core/rtw_pwrctrl.c:222:21: warning: equality
comparison with extraneous parentheses [-Wparentheses-equality]
        if ((pwrpriv->rpwm == pslv)) {
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~
drivers/staging/r8188eu/core/rtw_pwrctrl.c:222:21: note: remove
extraneous parentheses around the comparison to silence this warning
        if ((pwrpriv->rpwm == pslv)) {
            ~              ^      ~
drivers/staging/r8188eu/core/rtw_pwrctrl.c:222:21: note: use '=' to turn
this equality comparison into an assignment
        if ((pwrpriv->rpwm == pslv)) {
                           ^~
                           =
1 warning generated.

The compilers have agreed that single parentheses are used for equality
and double parentheses are used for assignment within control flow
statements such as if and while so remove them in these places to fix
the warning.
