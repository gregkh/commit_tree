powerpc/mce: Fix access error in mce handler

We queue an irq work for deferred processing of mce event in realmode
mce handler, where translation is disabled. Queuing of the work may
result in accessing memory outside RMO region, such access needs the
translation to be enabled for an LPAR running with hash mmu else the
kernel crashes.

After enabling translation in mce_handle_error() we used to leave it
enabled to avoid crashing here, but now with the commit
74c3354bc1d89 ("powerpc/pseries/mce: restore msr before returning from
handler") we are restoring the MSR to disable translation.

Hence to fix this enable the translation before queuing the work.

Without this change following trace is seen on injecting SLB multihit in
an LPAR running with hash mmu.
