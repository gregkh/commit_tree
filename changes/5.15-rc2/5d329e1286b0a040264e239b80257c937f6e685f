io_uring: allow retry for O_NONBLOCK if async is supported

A common complaint is that using O_NONBLOCK files with io_uring can be a
bit of a pain. Be a bit nicer and allow normal retry IFF the file does
support async behavior. This makes it possible to use io_uring more
reliably with O_NONBLOCK files, for use cases where it either isn't
possible or feasible to modify the file flags.
