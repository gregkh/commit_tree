drivers/base/node.c: use bin_attribute to break the size limitation of cpumap ABI

Reading /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/nodeX/ returns cpumap and cpulist.
However, the size of this file is limited to PAGE_SIZE because of the
limitation for sysfs attribute.

This patch moves to use bin_attribute to extend the ABI to be more
than one page so that cpumap bitmask and list won't be potentially
trimmed.
