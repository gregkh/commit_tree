Revert "drm/panel-simple: Add Samsung ATNA33XC20"

This reverts commit 4bfe6c8f7c23b01719671b69fd29b87a35ccd9d6.

This panel's power sequencing really can't be handled properly by
panel-simple because of the special sequencing needed for the EL_ON3
GPIO. The only way it was sorta working in the past was by trying to
jam that signal into the "enable-gpio", but that really wasn't a good
fit. We'll add a custom panel driver for this panel to do it right.
