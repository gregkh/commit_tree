brcmfmac: use separate firmware for 43430 revision 2

A separate firmware is needed for Broadcom 43430 revision 2.  This
chip can be found in e.g. certain revisions of Ampak AP6212 wireless
IC. Original firmware file from IC vendor is named
'fw_bcm43436b0.bin', but brcmfmac and also btbcm drivers report chip
id 43430, so requested firmware file name is
'brcmfmac43430b0-sdio.bin' in line with other 43430 revisions.
