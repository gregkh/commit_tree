ASoC: SOF: Intel: Use DMI string to search for adl_mx98373_rt5682 variant

DMI product name is used to support system variants based on
adl_mx98373_rt5682 in current implementation. Replace this DMI search with
DMI_OEM_STRING and coreboot(BIOS used in these systems) is
setting the needed DMI_OEM_STRING field to uniquely identify these
systems.
