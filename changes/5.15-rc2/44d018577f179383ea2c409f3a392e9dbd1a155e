scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Add encryption to I/O path

Some FC adapters from Marvell offer the ability to encrypt data in flight
(EDIF). This feature requires an application to act as an authenticator.

After the completion of PLOGI, both sides have authenticated and PRLI
completed, encrypted I/Os are allowed to proceed.

 - Use new firmware API to encrypt traffic on the wire

 - Add driver parameter to enable|disable EDIF feature

   # modprobe qla2xxx ql2xsecenable=1
