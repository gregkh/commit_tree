drm/msm/dpu: support setting up two independent DSI connectors

Move setting up encoders from set_encoder_mode to
_dpu_kms_initialize_dsi() / _dpu_kms_initialize_displayport(). This
allows us to support not only "single DSI" and "bonded DSI" but also "two
independent DSI" configurations. In future this would also help adding
support for multiple DP connectors.
