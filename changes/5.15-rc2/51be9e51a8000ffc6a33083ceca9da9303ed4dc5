KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Fix mapping of passthrough interrupts

PCI MSI interrupt numbers are now mapped in a PCI-MSI domain but the
underlying calls handling the passthrough of the interrupt in the
guest need a number in the XIVE IRQ domain.

Use the IRQ data mapped in the XIVE IRQ domain and not the one in the
PCI-MSI domain.
