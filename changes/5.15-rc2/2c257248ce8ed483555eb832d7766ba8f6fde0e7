net: ipa: don't suspend endpoints if setup not complete

Until we complete the setup stage of initialization, GSI is not
initialized and therefore endpoints aren't usable.  So avoid
suspending endpoints during system suspend unless setup is complete.

Clear the setup_complete flag at the top of ipa_teardown() to
reflect the fact that things are no longer in setup state.

Get rid of a misplaced (and superfluous) comment.
