eql: use ndo_siocdevprivate

The private ioctls in eql pass the arguments correctly through ifr_data,
but the slaving_request_t and slave_config_t structures are incompatible
with compat mode and need special conversion code in the driver.

Convert to siocdevprivate for now, and return an error when called
in compat mode.
