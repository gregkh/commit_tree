dma-buf: Delete the DMA-BUF attachment sysfs statistics

The DMA-BUF attachment statistics form a subset of the DMA-BUF
sysfs statistics that recently merged to the drm-misc tree. They are not
UABI yet since they have not merged to the upstream Linux kernel.

Since there has been a reported a performance regression due to the
overhead of sysfs directory creation/teardown during
dma_buf_attach()/dma_buf_detach(), this patch deletes the DMA-BUF
attachment statistics from sysfs.
