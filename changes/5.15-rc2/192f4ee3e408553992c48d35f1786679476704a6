drm/msm/a6xx: Add support for Adreno 7c Gen 3 gpu

This patch adds support for the gpu found in the Snapdragon 7c Gen 3
compute platform. This gpu is similar to the exisiting a660 gpu with
minor delta in the programing sequence. As the Adreno GPUs are moving
away from a numeric chipid based naming scheme to a string, it was
decided to use 0x06030500 as the chip id of this gpu to communicate
to the userspace driver.
