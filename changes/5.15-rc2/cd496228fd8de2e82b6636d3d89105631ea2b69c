KVM: arm64: Track value of cptr_el2 in struct kvm_vcpu_arch

Track the baseline guest value for cptr_el2 in struct
kvm_vcpu_arch, similar to the other registers that control traps.
Use this value when setting cptr_el2 for the guest.

Currently this value is unchanged (CPTR_EL2_DEFAULT), but future
patches will set trapping bits based on features supported for
the guest.

No functional change intended.
