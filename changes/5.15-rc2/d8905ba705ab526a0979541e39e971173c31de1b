drm/i915/xehp: Define multicast register ranges

Since we can't steer multicast register reads during ring-based
workaround verification, we need to define the multicast ranges where
failure to steer could potentially cause us to read back from a
fused-off register instance.

As with gen12, we can ignore the multicast ranges that the bspec
describes as 'SQIDI' since all instances of those registers will always
be present and we'll always be able to read back a workaround value that
was written with multicast.
