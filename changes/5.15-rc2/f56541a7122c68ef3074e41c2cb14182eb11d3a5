libnvdimm/labels: Add blk isetcookie set / validation helpers

In preparation for LIBNVDIMM to manage labels on CXL devices deploy
helpers that abstract the label type from the implementation. The CXL
label format is mostly similar to the EFI label format with concepts /
fields added, like dynamic region creation and label type guids, and
other concepts removed like BLK-mode and interleave-set-cookie ids.

Given BLK-mode is not even supported on CXL push hide the BLK-mode
specific details inside the helpers.
