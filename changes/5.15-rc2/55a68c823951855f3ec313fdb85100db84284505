memcg: replace in_interrupt() by !in_task() in active_memcg()

set_active_memcg() uses in_interrupt() check to select proper storage for
cgroup: pointer on task struct or per-cpu pointer.

It isn't fully correct: obsoleted in_interrupt() includes tasks with
disabled BH.  It's better to use '!in_task()' instead.
