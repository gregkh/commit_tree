drm/amd/display: Fix white screen page fault for gpuvm

[Why]
The "base_addr_is_mc_addr" field was added for dcn3.1 support but
pa_config was never updated to set it to false.

Uninitialized memory causes it to be set to true which results in
address mistranslation and white screen.

[How]
Use memset to ensure all fields are initialized to 0 by default.
