ALSA: korg1212: Fix wrongly shuffled firmware loader code

The recent change for the devres introduced the wrong code shuffling
in the korg1212 firmware loader function that may lead to a bad
pointer access.  Restore the calls in the right order (and put back
the release_firmware() call in the error path, too).
