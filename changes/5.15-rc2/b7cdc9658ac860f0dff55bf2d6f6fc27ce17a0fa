net: fec: add WoL support for i.MX8MQ

By default FEC driver treat irq[0] (i.e. int0 described in dt-binding) as
wakeup interrupt, but this situation changed on i.MX8M serials, SoC
integration guys mix wakeup interrupt signal into int2 interrupt line.
This patch introduces FEC_QUIRK_WAKEUP_FROM_INT2 to indicate int2 as wakeup
interrupt for i.MX8MQ.
