powerpc/smp: Use existing L2 cache_map cpumask to find L3 cache siblings

On POWER10 systems, the "ibm,thread-groups" property "2" indicates the cpus
in thread-group share both L2 and L3 caches. Hence, use cache_property = 2
itself to find both the L2 and L3 cache siblings.
Hence, create a new thread_group_l3_cache_map to keep list of L3 siblings,
but fill the mask using same property "2" array.
