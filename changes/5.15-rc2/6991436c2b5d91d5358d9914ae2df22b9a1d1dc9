sched/core: Provide a scheduling point for RT locks

RT enabled kernels substitute spin/rwlocks with 'sleeping' variants based
on rtmutexes. Blocking on such a lock is similar to preemption versus:

 - I/O scheduling and worker handling, because these functions might block
   on another substituted lock, or come from a lock contention within these
   functions.

 - RCU considers this like a preemption, because the task might be in a read
   side critical section.

Add a separate scheduling point for this, and hand a new scheduling mode
argument to __schedule() which allows, along with separate mode masks, to
handle this gracefully from within the scheduler, without proliferating that
to other subsystems like RCU.
