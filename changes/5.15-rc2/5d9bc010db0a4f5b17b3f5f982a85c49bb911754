clk: qcom: a53-pll: Add MSM8939 a53pll support

MSM8939 has 3 a53pll clocks with different frequency table for Cluster0,
Cluster1 and CCI.  It adds function qcom_a53pll_get_freq_tbl() to create
pll_freq_tbl from OPP, so that those a53pll frequencies can be defined
in DT with operating-points-v2 bindings rather than being coded in the
driver.  In this case, one compatible rather than three would be needed
for these 3 a53pll clocks.
