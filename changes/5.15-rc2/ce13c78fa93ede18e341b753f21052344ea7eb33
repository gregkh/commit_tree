drm/i915: Disable gpu relocations

Media userspace was the last userspace to still use them, and they
converted now too:

https://github.com/intel/media-driver/commit/144020c37770083974bedf59902b70b8f444c799

This means no reason anymore to make relocations faster than they've
been for the first 9 years of gem. This code was added in

    drm/i915: Async GPU relocation processing

Furthermore there's pretty strong indications it's buggy, since the
code to use it by default as the only option had to be reverted:

    Revert "drm/i915/gem: Async GPU relocations only"

This code just disables gpu relocations, leaving the garbage
collection for later patches and more importantly, much less confusing
diff. Also given how much headaches this code has caused in the past,
letting this soak for a bit seems justified.
