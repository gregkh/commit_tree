char: tpm: cr50_i2c: convert to new probe interface

Way back when this driver was written the I2C framework
used to insist an ID table be defined even if the driver
did not use it in favor of ACPI/OF matching, so it was
added just to placate the hard I2C framework requirement.

This is no longer the case so we can drop the table and
also convert the driver to the new probe interface.
