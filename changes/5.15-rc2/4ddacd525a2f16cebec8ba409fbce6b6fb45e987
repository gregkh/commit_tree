kvm: x86: Set KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID to 4*KVM_MAX_VCPUS

Instead of requiring KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID to be manually increased
every time we increase KVM_MAX_VCPUS, set it to 4*KVM_MAX_VCPUS.
This should be enough for CPU topologies where Cores-per-Package
and Packages-per-Socket are not powers of 2.

In practice, this increases KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID from 1023 to 1152.
The only side effect of this change is making some fields in
struct kvm_ioapic larger, increasing the struct size from 1628 to
1780 bytes (in x86_64).
