sched/idle: Make the idle timer expire in hard interrupt context

The intel powerclamp driver will setup a per-CPU worker with RT
priority. The worker will then invoke play_idle() in which it remains in
the idle poll loop until it is stopped by the timer it started earlier.

That timer needs to expire in hard interrupt context on PREEMPT_RT.
Otherwise the timer will expire in ksoftirqd as a SOFT timer but that task
won't be scheduled on the CPU because its priority is lower than the
priority of the worker which is in the idle loop.

Always expire the idle timer in hard interrupt context.
