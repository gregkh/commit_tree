Revert "of: property: fw_devlink: Add support for "phy-handle" property"

This reverts commit cf4b94c8530d14017fbddae26aad064ddc42edd4.

Some PHYs pointed to by "phy-handle" will never bind to a driver until a
consumer attaches to it. And when the consumer attaches to it, they get
forcefully bound to a generic PHY driver. In such cases, parsing the
phy-handle property and creating a device link will prevent the consumer
from ever probing. We don't want that. So revert support for
"phy-handle" property until we come up with a better mechanism for
binding PHYs to generic drivers before a consumer tries to attach to it.
