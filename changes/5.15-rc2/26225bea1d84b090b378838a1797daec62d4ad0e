iommu: Expose DMA domain strictness via sysfs

The sysfs interface for default domain types exists primarily so users
can choose the performance/security tradeoff relevant to their own
workload. As such, the choice between the policies for DMA domains fits
perfectly as an additional point on that scale - downgrading a
particular device from a strict default to non-strict may be enough to
let it reach the desired level of performance, while still retaining
more peace of mind than with a wide-open identity domain. Now that we've
abstracted non-strict mode as a distinct type of DMA domain, allow it to
be chosen through the user interface as well.
