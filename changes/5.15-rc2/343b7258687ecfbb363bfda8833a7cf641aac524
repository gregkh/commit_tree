PCI: Add 'override_only' field to struct pci_device_id

Add 'override_only' field to struct pci_device_id to be used as part of
pci_match_device().

When set, a driver only matches the entry when dev->driver_override is
set to that driver.

In addition, add a helper macro named 'PCI_DEVICE_DRIVER_OVERRIDE' to
enable setting some data on it.

Next patch from this series will use the above functionality.
