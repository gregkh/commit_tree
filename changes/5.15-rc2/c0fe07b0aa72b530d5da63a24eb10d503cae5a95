mm/debug_vm_pgtable: use struct pgtable_debug_args in PMD modifying tests

This uses struct pgtable_debug_args in PMD modifying tests.  The allocated
huge page is used when set_pmd_at() is used.  The corresponding tests are
skipped if the huge page doesn't exist.  Besides, the unused variable
@pmd_aligned in debug_vm_pgtable() is dropped.
