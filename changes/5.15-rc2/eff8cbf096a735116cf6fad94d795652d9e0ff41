drm/amdkfd: AIP mGPUs best prefetch location for xnack on

For xnack on, if range ACCESS or ACCESS_IN_PLACE (AIP) by single GPU, or
range is ACCESS_IN_PLACE by mGPUs and all mGPUs connection on XGMI same
hive, the best prefetch location is prefetch_loc GPU. Otherwise, the best
prefetch location is always CPU because GPU does not have coherent
mapping VRAM of other GPUs even with large-BAR PCIe connection.
