PCI/ACPI: Don't reset a fwnode set by OF

Commit 375553a93201 ("PCI: Setup ACPI fwnode early and at the same time
with OF") added a call to pci_set_acpi_fwnode() in pci_setup_device(),
which unconditionally clears any fwnode previously set by
pci_set_of_node().

pci_set_acpi_fwnode() looks for ACPI_COMPANION(), which only returns the
existing fwnode if it was set by ACPI_COMPANION_SET(). If it was set by
OF instead, ACPI_COMPANION() returns NULL and pci_set_acpi_fwnode()
accidentally clears the fwnode. To fix this, look for any fwnode instead
of just ACPI companions.

Fixes a virtio-iommu boot regression in v5.15-rc1.
