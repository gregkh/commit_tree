dmanegine: idxd: add software command status

Enabling device and wq returns standard errno and that does not provide
enough details to indicate what exactly failed. The hardware command status
is only 8bits. Expand the command status to 32bits and use the upper 16
bits to define software errors to provide more details on the exact
failure. Bit 31 will be used to indicate the error is software set as the
driver is using some of the spec defined hardware error as well.
