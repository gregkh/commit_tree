platform/x86: dell-smbios: Remove unused dmi_system_id table

dell-smbios is depended on by dell-laptop and that has this same table +
some extra entries for chassis-type 30, 31 and 32.

Since dell-laptop will already auto-load based on the DMI table in there
(which also is more complete) and since dell-laptop will then bring in
the dell-smbios module, the only scenario I can think of where this DMI
table inside dell-smbios-smm.c is useful is if users have the dell-laptop
module disabled and they want to use the sysfs interface offered by
dell-smbios-smm.c. But that is such a corner case, even requiring a custom
kernel build, that it does not weigh up against having this duplicate
table, which as the current state already shows can only grow stale.

Users who do hit this corner-case can always explicitly modprobe /
insmod the module.
