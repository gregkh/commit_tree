sk_buff: avoid potentially clearing 'slow_gro' field

If skb_dst_set_noref() is invoked with a NULL dst, the 'slow_gro'
field is cleared, too. That could lead to wrong behavior if
the skb later enters the GRO stage.

Fix the potential issue replacing preserving a non-zero value of
the 'slow_gro' field.

Additionally, fix a comment typo.
