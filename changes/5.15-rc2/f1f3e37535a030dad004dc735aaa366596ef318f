drm/vmwgfx: Switch to using DRM_IOCTL_DEF_DRV

The macro has been accounting for DRM_COMMAND_BASE for a long time
now so there's no reason to still be duplicating it. Plus we were
leaving the name undefined which meant that all the DRM ioctl
warnings/errors were always listing "null" ioctl at the culprit.

This fixes the undefined ioctl name and removes duplicated code.
