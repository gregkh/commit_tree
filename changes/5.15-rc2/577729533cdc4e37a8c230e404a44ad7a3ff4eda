drm/i915: Document the Virtual Engine uAPI

A little bit of documentation covering the topics of engine discovery,
context engine maps and virtual engines. It is not very detailed but
supposed to be a starting point of giving a brief high level overview of
general principles and intended use cases.

v2:
 * Have the text in uapi header and link from there.

v4:
 * Link from driver-uapi.rst.
