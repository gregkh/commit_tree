writeback: memcg: simplify cgroup_writeback_by_id

Currently cgroup_writeback_by_id calls mem_cgroup_wb_stats() to get dirty
pages for a memcg.  However mem_cgroup_wb_stats() does a lot more than
just get the number of dirty pages.  Just directly get the number of dirty
pages instead of calling mem_cgroup_wb_stats().  Also
cgroup_writeback_by_id() is only called for best-effort dirty flushing, so
remove the unused 'nr' parameter and no need to explicitly flush memcg
stats.
