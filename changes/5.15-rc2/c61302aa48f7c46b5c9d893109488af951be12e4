vfio/pci: Move module parameters to vfio_pci.c

This is a preparation before splitting vfio_pci.ko to 2 modules.

As module parameters are a kind of uAPI they need to stay on vfio_pci.ko
to avoid a user visible impact.

For now continue to keep the implementation of these options in
vfio_pci_core.c. Arguably they are vfio_pci functionality, but further
splitting of vfio_pci_core.c will be better done in another series
