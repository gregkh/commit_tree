staging: sm750fb: Rename vCursor to v_cursor in lynxfb_crtc

The struct lynxfb_crtc has a member named vCursor. This name is
CamelCase and is frowned upon. This commit renames it to v_cursor
and makes the necessary changes for the module to build.

This change also fixes the following checkpatch CHECK:

+	unsigned char __iomem *vCursor; /* virtual address of cursor */
