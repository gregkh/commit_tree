arm64/sve: Use correct size when reinitialising SVE state

When we need a buffer for SVE register state we call sve_alloc() to make
sure that one is there. In order to avoid repeated allocations and frees
we keep the buffer around unless we change vector length and just memset()
it to ensure a clean register state. The function that deals with this
takes the task to operate on as an argument, however in the case where we
do a memset() we initialise using the SVE state size for the current task
rather than the task passed as an argument.

This is only an issue in the case where we are setting the register state
for a task via ptrace and the task being configured has a different vector
length to the task tracing it. In the case where the buffer is larger in
the traced process we will leak old state from the traced process to
itself, in the case where the buffer is smaller in the traced process we
will overflow the buffer and corrupt memory.
