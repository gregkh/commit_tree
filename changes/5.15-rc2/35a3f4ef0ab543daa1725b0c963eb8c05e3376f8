alpha: Declare virt_to_phys and virt_to_bus parameter as pointer to volatile

Some drivers pass a pointer to volatile data to virt_to_bus() and
virt_to_phys(), and that works fine.  One exception is alpha.  This
results in a number of compile errors such as

  drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_main.c: In function 'lmc_softreset':
  drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_main.c:1782:50: error:
	passing argument 1 of 'virt_to_bus' discards 'volatile'
	qualifier from pointer target type

  drivers/atm/ambassador.c: In function 'do_loader_command':
  drivers/atm/ambassador.c:1747:58: error:
	passing argument 1 of 'virt_to_bus' discards 'volatile'
	qualifier from pointer target type

Declare the parameter of virt_to_phys and virt_to_bus as pointer to
volatile to fix the problem.
