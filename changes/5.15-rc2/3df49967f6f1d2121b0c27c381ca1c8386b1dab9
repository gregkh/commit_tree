block: flush the integrity workqueue in blk_integrity_unregister

When the integrity profile is unregistered there can still be integrity
reads queued up which could see a NULL verify_fn as shown by the race
window below:

CPU0                                    CPU1
  process_one_work                      nvme_validate_ns
    bio_integrity_verify_fn                nvme_update_ns_info
	                                     nvme_update_disk_info
	                                       blk_integrity_unregister
                                               ---set queue->integrity as 0
	bio_integrity_process
	--access bi->profile->verify_fn(bi is a pointer of queue->integity)

Before calling blk_integrity_unregister in nvme_update_disk_info, we must
make sure that there is no work item in the kintegrityd_wq. Just call
blk_flush_integrity to flush the work queue so the bug can be resolved.
