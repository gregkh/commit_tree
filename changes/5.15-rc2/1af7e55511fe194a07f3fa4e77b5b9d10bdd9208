vhost/vsock: support MSG_EOR bit processing

'MSG_EOR' handling has similar logic as 'MSG_EOM' - if bit present
in packet's header, reset it to 0. Then restore it back if packet
processing wasn't completed. Instead of bool variable for each
flag, bit mask variable was added: it has logical OR of 'MSG_EOR'
and 'MSG_EOM' if needed, to restore flags, this variable is ORed
with flags field of packet.
