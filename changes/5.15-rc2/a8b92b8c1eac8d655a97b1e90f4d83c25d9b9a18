s390/pci_mmio: fully validate the VMA before calling follow_pte()

We should not walk/touch page tables outside of VMA boundaries when
holding only the mmap sem in read mode. Evil user space can modify the
VMA layout just before this function runs and e.g., trigger races with
page table removal code since commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages
with read mmap_sem in munmap").

find_vma() does not check if the address is >= the VMA start address;
use vma_lookup() instead.
