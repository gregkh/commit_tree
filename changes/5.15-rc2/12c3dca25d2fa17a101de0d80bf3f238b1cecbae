ARM: ep93xx: remove MaverickCrunch support

The MaverickCrunch support for ep93xx never made it into glibc and
was removed from gcc in its 4.8 release in 2012. It is now one of
the last parts of arch/arm/ that fails to build with the clang
integrated assembler, which is unlikely to ever want to support it.

The two alternatives are to force the use of binutils/gas when
building the crunch support, or to remove it entirely.

According to Hartley Sweeten:

 "Martin Guy did a lot of work trying to get the maverick crunch working
  but I was never able to successfully use it for anything. It "kind"
  of works but depending on the EP93xx silicon revision there are still
  a number of hardware bugs that either give imprecise or garbage results.

  I have no problem with removing the kernel support for the maverick
  crunch."

Unless someone else comes up with a good reason to keep it around,
remove it now. This touches mostly the ep93xx platform, but removes
a bit of code from ARM common ptrace and signal frame handling as well.

If there are remaining users of MaverickCrunch, they can use LTS
kernels for at least another five years before kernel support ends.
