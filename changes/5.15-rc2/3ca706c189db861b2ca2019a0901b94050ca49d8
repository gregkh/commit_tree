drm/ttm: fix type mismatch error on sparc64

On sparc64, __fls() returns an "int", but the drm TTM code expected it
to be "unsigned long" as on x86.  As a result, on sparc (and arc, and
m68k) you get build errors because 'min()' checks that the types match.

As suggested by Linus, it can use min_t instead of min to force the type
to be "unsigned int".
