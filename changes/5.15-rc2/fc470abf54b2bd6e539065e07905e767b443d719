binderfs: add support for feature files

Provide userspace with a mechanism to discover features supported by
the binder driver to refrain from using any unsupported ones in the
first place. Starting with "oneway_spam_detection" only new features
are to be listed under binderfs and all previous ones are assumed to
be supported.

Assuming an instance of binderfs has been mounted at /dev/binderfs,
binder feature files can be found under /dev/binderfs/features/.
Usage example:

  $ mkdir /dev/binderfs
  $ mount -t binder binder /dev/binderfs
  $ cat /dev/binderfs/features/oneway_spam_detection
