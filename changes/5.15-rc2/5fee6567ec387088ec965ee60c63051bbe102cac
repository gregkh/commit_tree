dmaengine: idxd: add type to driver in order to allow device matching

Add an array of support device types to the idxd_device_driver
definition in order to enable simple matching of device type to a
given driver. The deprecated / omnibus dsa_drv driver specifies
IDXD_DEV_NONE as its only role is to service legacy userspace (old
accel-config) directed bind requests and route them to them the proper
driver. It need not attach to a device when the bus is autoprobed. The
accel-config tooling is being updated to drop its dependency on this
deprecated bind scheme.
