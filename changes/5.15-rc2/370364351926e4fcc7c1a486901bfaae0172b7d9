tracing/histogram: Update the documentation for the buckets modifier

Update both the tracefs README file as well as the histogram.rst to
include an explanation of what the buckets modifier is and how to use it.
Include an example with the wakeup_latency example for both log2 and the
buckets modifiers as there was no existing log2 example.
