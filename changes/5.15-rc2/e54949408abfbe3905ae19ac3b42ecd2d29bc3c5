KVM: VMX: Move RESET-only VMWRITE sequences to init_vmcs()

Move VMWRITE sequences in vmx_vcpu_reset() guarded by !init_event into
init_vmcs() to make it more obvious that they're, uh, initializing the
VMCS.

No meaningful functional change intended (though the order of VMWRITEs
and whatnot is different).
