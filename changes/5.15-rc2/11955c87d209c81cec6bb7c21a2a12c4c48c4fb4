drm/i915/dg2: Update to bigjoiner path

In verify_mpllb_state() encoder is retrieved from best_encoder
of connector_state. As there will be only one connector_state
for bigjoiner and checking encoder may not be needed for
bigjoiner-slave. This code path related to mpll is done on dg2
and need this fix to avoid null pointer dereference issue.
