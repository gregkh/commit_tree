bpf: Relicense disassembler as GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-2-Clause

Some time ago we dual-licensed both libbpf and bpftool through commits
1bc38b8ff6cc ("libbpf: relicense libbpf as LGPL-2.1 OR BSD-2-Clause")
and 907b22365115 ("tools: bpftool: dual license all files"). The latter
missed the disasm.{c,h} which we pull in via kernel/bpf/ such that we
have a single source for verifier as well as bpftool asm dumping, see
also f4ac7e0b5cc8 ("bpf: move instruction printing into a separate file").
It is currently GPL-2.0-only and missed the conversion in 907b22365115,
therefore relicense the two as GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-2-Clause as well.
