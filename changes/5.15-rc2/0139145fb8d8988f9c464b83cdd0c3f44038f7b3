net/mlx5: DR, Added support for REMOVE_HEADER packet reformat

ConnectX supports offloading of various encapsulations and decapsulations
(e.g. VXLAN), which are performed by 'Packet Reformat' action. Starting
with ConnectX-6 DX, a new reformat type is supported - REMOVE_HEADER, which
allows deleting an arbitrary size chunk at the selected position in the packet.
