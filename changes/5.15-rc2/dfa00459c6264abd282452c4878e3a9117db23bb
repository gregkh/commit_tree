tools headers UAPI: Sync linux/kvm.h with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  f95937ccf5bd5e0a ("KVM: stats: Support linear and logarithmic histogram statistics")
  f0376edb1ddcab19 ("KVM: arm64: Add ioctl to fetch/store tags in a guest")
  ea7fc1bb1cd1b92b ("KVM: arm64: Introduce MTE VM feature")

That just rebuilds perf, as these patches don't add any new KVM ioctl to
be harvested for the the 'perf trace' ioctl syscall argument
beautifiers.

This is also by now used by tools/testing/selftests/kvm/, so that will
pick the new KVM_STATS_TYPE_LINEAR_HIST and KVM_STATS_TYPE_LOG_HIST
defines.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/linux/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h include/uapi/linux/kvm.h
