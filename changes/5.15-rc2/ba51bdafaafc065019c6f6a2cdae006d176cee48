scsi: sr: cdrom: Move cdrom_read_cdda_bpc() into the sr driver

cdrom_read_cdda_bpc() relies on sending SCSI command to the low level
driver using a REQ_OP_SCSI_IN request.  This isn't generic block layer
functionality, so move the actual low-level code into the sr driver and
call it through a new read_cdda_bpc method in the cdrom_device_ops
structure.

With this the CDROM code does not have to pull in scsi_normalize_sense()
and depend on CONFIG_SCSI_COMMON.
