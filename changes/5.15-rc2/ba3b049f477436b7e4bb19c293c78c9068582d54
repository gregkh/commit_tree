drm/i915/adl_p: Allow underrun recovery when possible

ADL_P requires that we disable underrun recovery when downscaling (or
using the scaler for YUV420 pipe output), using DSC, or using PSR2.
Otherwise we should be able to enable the underrun recovery.

On DG2 we need to keep underrun recovery disabled at all times, but the
chicken bit in PIPE_CHICKEN has an inverted meaning (it's an enable bit
instead of disable).

v2:
 - Reverse the condition (clear the disable bit when supported, set
   disable bit when not supported).
