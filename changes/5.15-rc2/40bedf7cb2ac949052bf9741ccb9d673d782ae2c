bnxt: count packets discarded because of netpoll

bnxt may discard packets if Rx completions are consumed
in an attempt to let netpoll make progress. It should be
extremely rare in practice but nonetheless such events
should be counted.

Since completion ring memory is allocated dynamically use
a similar scheme to what is done for HW stats to save them.

Report the stats in rx_dropped and per-netdev ethtool
counter. Chances that users care which ring dropped are
very low.

v3: only save the stat to rx_dropped on reset,
rx_total_netpoll_discards will now only show drops since
last reset, similar to other "total_discard" counters.
