ASoC: Intel: update sof_pcm512x quirks

The default SOF topology enables SSP capture and DMICs, even though
both of these hardware capabilities are not always available in
hardware (specific versions of HiFiberry and DMIC kit needed).

For the SSP capture, this leads to annoying "SP5-Codec: ASoC: no
backend capture" and "streamSSP5-Codec: ASoC: no users capture at
close - state 0" errors.

Update the quirks to match what the topology needs, which also allows
for the ability to remove SSP capture and DMIC support.
