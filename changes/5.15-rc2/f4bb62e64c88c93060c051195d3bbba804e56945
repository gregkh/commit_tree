tipc: increase timeout in tipc_sk_enqueue()

In tipc_sk_enqueue() we use hardcoded 2 jiffies to extract
socket buffer from generic queue to particular socket.
The 2 jiffies is too short in case there are other high priority
tasks get CPU cycles for multiple jiffies update. As result, no
buffer could be enqueued to particular socket.

To solve this, we switch to use constant timeout 20msecs.
Then, the function will be expired between 2 jiffies (CONFIG_100HZ)
and 20 jiffies (CONFIG_1000HZ).
