drm/amd/display: ensure dentist display clock update finished in DCN20

[Why]
We don't check DENTIST_DISPCLK_CHG_DONE to ensure dentist
display clockis updated to target value. In some scenarios with large
display clock margin, it will deliver unfinished display clock and cause
issues like display black screen.

[How]
Checking DENTIST_DISPCLK_CHG_DONE to ensure display clock
has been update to target value before driver do other clock related
actions.
