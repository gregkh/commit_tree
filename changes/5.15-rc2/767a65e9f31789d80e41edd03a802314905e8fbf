io-wq: fix potential race of acct->nr_workers

Given max_worker is 1, and we currently have 1 running and it is
exiting. There may be race like:
 io_wqe_enqueue                   worker1
                               no work there and timeout
                               unlock(wqe->lock)
 ->insert work
                               -->io_worker_exit
 lock(wqe->lock)
 ->if(!nr_workers) //it's still 1
 unlock(wqe->lock)
    goto run_cancel
                                  lock(wqe->lock)
                                  nr_workers--
                                  ->dec_running
                                    ->worker creation fails
                                  unlock(wqe->lock)

We enqueued one work but there is no workers, causes hung.
