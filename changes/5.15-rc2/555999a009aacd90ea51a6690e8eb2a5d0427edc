kasan: test: avoid corrupting memory via memset

kmalloc_oob_memset_*() tests do writes past the allocated objects.  As the
result, they corrupt memory, which might lead to crashes with the HW_TAGS
mode, as it neither uses quarantine nor redzones.

Adjust the tests to only write memory within the aligned kmalloc objects.

Also add a comment mentioning that memset tests are designed to touch both
valid and invalid memory.
