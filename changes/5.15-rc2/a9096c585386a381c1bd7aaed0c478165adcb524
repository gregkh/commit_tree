media: hantro: h264: Move DPB valid and long-term bitmaps

In order to reuse these bitmaps, move this process to
struct hantro_h264_dec_hw_ctx. This will be used by
the Rockchip VDPU2 H.264 driver.

This idea was originally proposed by Jonas Karlman
in "[RFC 08/12] media: hantro: Fix H264 decoding of field encoded content"
which was posted a while ago.
