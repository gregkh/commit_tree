ALSA: harmony: Drop superfluous address setup

Harmony driver never uses CONTINUOUS buffer type any longer, hence the
code setting the address is superfluous.  Moreover, the recent change
in the ALSA core already covered the missing address field; it's
already set up.  So let's drop the superfluous line, which includes
the full hw_params callback.
