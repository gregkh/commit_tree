net: dsa: flush the dynamic FDB of the software bridge when fast ageing a port

Currently, when DSA performs fast ageing on a port, 'bridge fdb' shows
us that the 'self' entries (corresponding to the hardware bridge, as
printed by dsa_slave_fdb_dump) are deleted, but the 'master' entries
(corresponding to the software bridge) aren't.

Indeed, searching through the bridge driver, neither the
brport_attr_learning handler nor the IFLA_BRPORT_LEARNING handler call
br_fdb_delete_by_port. However, br_stp_disable_port does, which is one
of the paths which DSA uses to trigger a fast ageing process anyway.

There is, however, one other very promising caller of
br_fdb_delete_by_port, and that is the bridge driver's handler of the
SWITCHDEV_FDB_FLUSH_TO_BRIDGE atomic notifier. Currently the s390/qeth
HiperSockets card driver is the only user of this.

I can't say I understand that driver's architecture or interaction with
the bridge, but it appears to not be a switchdev driver in the traditional
sense of the word. Nonetheless, the mechanism it provides is a useful
way for DSA to express the fact that it performs fast ageing too, in a
way that does not change the existing behavior for other drivers.
