mmc: JZ4740: remove the flush_kernel_dcache_page call in jz4740_mmc_read_data

Patch series "_kernel_dcache_page fixes and removal".

While looking to convert the block layer away from kmap_atomic towards
kmap_local_page and prefeably the helpers that abstract it away I noticed
that a few block drivers directly or implicitly call
flush_kernel_dcache_page before kunmapping a page that has been written
to.

flush_kernel_dcache_page is documented to to be used in such cases, but
flush_dcache_page is actually required when the page could be in the page
cache and mapped to userspace, which is pretty much always the case when
kmapping an arbitrary page.  Unfortunately the documentation doesn't
exactly make that clear, which lead to this misused.  And it turns out
that only the copy_strings / copy_string_kernel in the exec code were
actually correct users of flush_kernel_dcache_page, which is why I think
we should just remove it and eat the very minor overhead in exec rather
than confusing poor driver writers.

This patch (of 6):

MIPS now implements flush_kernel_dcache_page (as an alias to
flush_dcache_page).
