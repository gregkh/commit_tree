btrfs: uninline btrfs_bg_flags_to_raid_index

The helper does a simple translation from block group flags to index to
the btrfs_raid_array table. There's no apparent reason to inline the
function, the translation happens usually once per function and is not
called in a loop.

Making it a proper function saves quite some binary code (x86_64,
release config):

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
1164011   19253   14912 1198176  124860 pre/btrfs.ko
1161559   19253   14912 1195724  123ecc post/btrfs.ko

DELTA: -2451

Also add the const attribute as there are no side effects, this could
help compiler to optimize a few things without the function body.
