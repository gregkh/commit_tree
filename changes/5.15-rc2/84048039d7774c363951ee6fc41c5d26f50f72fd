mm, slub: don't disable irq for debug_check_no_locks_freed()

In slab_free_hook() we disable irqs around the debug_check_no_locks_freed()
call, which is unnecessary, as irqs are already being disabled inside the call.
This seems to be leftover from the past where there were more calls inside the
irq disabled sections. Remove the irq disable/enable operations.
