mm/filemap: Add folio_wait_bit()

Rename wait_on_page_bit() to folio_wait_bit().  We must always wait on
the folio, otherwise we won't be woken up due to the tail page hashing
to a different bucket from the head page.

This commit shrinks the kernel by 770 bytes, mostly due to moving
the page waitqueue lookup into folio_wait_bit_common().
