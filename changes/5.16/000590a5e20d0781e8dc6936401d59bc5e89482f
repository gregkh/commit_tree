Revert "clk: rockchip: use module_platform_driver_probe"

This reverts commit 1da80da028fe5accb866c0d6899a292ed86bef45.

Reading recent discussions [0] [1], I realized this change introduces
a number of problems:

- only converting to module_platform_driver creates the issue
  with the existing __init and __initdata attributes.

  When the driver would've been built as a module, all the missing
  clock-definitions (all are initdata) should've turned up as error
  in testing suggesting that the change wasn't at all

- a clock driver is a very core component of soc bringup and making
  this able to be built as a module solely for enabling the soc vendor
  to add out of tree changes for Android implementations is not in our
  interest and also everything except a ramdisk won't probe without a
  clock controller.

  This is especially true when the changes aren't really tested and
  are merely added to move the mainline driver "out of the way".
