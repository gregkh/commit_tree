bnxt_en: Update firmware interface to 1.10.2.63

The main changes are firmware live patch support and 2 additional FEC
standard counters.

Add the matching FEC counters to ethtool counter array.  Firmware older
than 220 does not return the proper size of the extended RX counters so
we need to cap it at the smaller legacy size.  Otherwise the new FEC
counters may show up with garbage values.
