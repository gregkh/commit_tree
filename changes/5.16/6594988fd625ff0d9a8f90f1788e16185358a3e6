clk: composite: Use rate_ops.determine_rate when also a mux is available

Update clk_composite_determine_rate() to use rate_ops.determine_rate
when available in combination with a mux. So far clk_divider_ops provide
both, .round_rate and .determine_rate. Removing the former would make
clk-composite fail silently for example on Rockchip platforms (which
heavily use composite clocks).
Add support for using rate_ops.determine_rate when either
rate_ops.round_rate is not available or both (.round_rate and
.determine_rate) are provided.
