sched/topology: Introduce sched_group::flags

There exist situations in which the load balance needs to know the
properties of the CPUs in a scheduling group. When using asymmetric
packing, for instance, the load balancer needs to know not only the
state of dst_cpu but also of its SMT siblings, if any.

Use the flags of the child scheduling domains to initialize scheduling
group flags. This will reflect the properties of the CPUs in the
group.

A subsequent changeset will make use of these new flags. No functional
changes are introduced.
