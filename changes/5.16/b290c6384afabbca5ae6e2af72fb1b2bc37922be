net: dsa: b53: Drop BCM5301x workaround for a wrong CPU/IMP port

On BCM5301x port 8 requires a fixed link when used.

Years ago when b53 was an OpenWrt downstream driver (with configuration
based on sometimes bugged NVRAM) there was a need for a fixup. In case
of forcing fixed link for (incorrectly specified) port 5 the code had to
actually setup port 8 link.

For upstream b53 driver with setup based on DT there is no need for that
workaround. In DT we have and require correct ports setup.
