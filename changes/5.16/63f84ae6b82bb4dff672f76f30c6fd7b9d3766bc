tracing/histogram: Do not copy the fixed-size char array field over the field size

Do not copy the fixed-size char array field of the events over
the field size. The histogram treats char array as a string and
there are 2 types of char array in the event, fixed-size and
dynamic string. The dynamic string (__data_loc) field must be
null terminated, but the fixed-size char array field may not
be null terminated (not a string, but just a data).
In that case, histogram can copy the data after the field.
This uses the original field size for fixed-size char array
field to restrict the histogram not to access over the original
field size.
