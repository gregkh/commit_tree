octeontx2-af: Perform cpt lf teardown in non FLR path

Perform CPT LF teardown in non FLR path as well via cpt_lf_free()
Currently CPT LF teardown and reset sequence is only
done when FLR is handled with CPT LF still attached.

This patch also fixes cpt_lf_alloc() to set EXEC_LDWB in
CPT_AF_LFX_CTL2 when being completely overwritten as that is
the default value and is better for performance.
