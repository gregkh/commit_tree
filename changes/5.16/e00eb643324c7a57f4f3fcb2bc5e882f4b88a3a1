dt-bindings: net: dsa: inherit the ethernet-controller DT schema

Since a switch is basically a bunch of Ethernet controllers, just
inherit the common schema for one to get stronger type validation of the
properties of a port.

For example, before this change it was valid to have a phy-mode = "xfi"
even if "xfi" is not part of ethernet-controller.yaml, now it is not.
