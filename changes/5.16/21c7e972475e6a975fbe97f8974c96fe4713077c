scsi: hisi_sas: Disable SATA disk phy for severe I_T nexus reset failure

If the softreset fails in the I_T reset, libsas will then continue to issue
a controller reset to try to recover.

However a faulty disk may cause the softreset to fail, and resetting the
controller will not help this scenario. Indeed, we will just continue the
cycle of error handle handling to try to recover.

So if the softreset fails upon certain conditions, just disable the phy
associated with the disk. The user needs to handle this problem.
