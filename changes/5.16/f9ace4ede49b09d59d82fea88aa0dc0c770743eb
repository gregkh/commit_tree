riscv: remove .text section size limitation for XIP

Currently there's a limit of 8MB for the .text section of a RISC-V
image in the XIP case. This breaks compilation of many automatic
builds and is generally inconvenient. This patch removes that
limitation and optimizes XIP image file size at the same time.
