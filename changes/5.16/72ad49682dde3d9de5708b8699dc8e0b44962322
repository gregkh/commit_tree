drm/connector: Add support for out-of-band hotplug notification (v3)

Add a new drm_connector_oob_hotplug_event() function and
oob_hotplug_event drm_connector_funcs member.

On some hardware a hotplug event notification may come from outside the
display driver / device. An example of this is some USB Type-C setups
where the hardware muxes the DisplayPort data and aux-lines but does
not pass the altmode HPD status bit to the GPU's DP HPD pin.

In cases like this the new drm_connector_oob_hotplug_event() function can
be used to report these out-of-band events.

Changes in v2:
- Make drm_connector_oob_hotplug_event() take a fwnode as argument and
  have it call drm_connector_find_by_fwnode() internally. This allows
  making drm_connector_find_by_fwnode() a drm-internal function and
  avoids code outside the drm subsystem potentially holding on the
  a drm_connector reference for a longer period.

Changes in v3:
- Drop the data argument to the drm_connector_oob_hotplug_event
  function since it is not used atm. This can be re-added later when
  a use for it actually arises.
