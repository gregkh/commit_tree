drm/amdgpu: disable runpm if we are the primary adapter

If we are the primary adapter (i.e., the one used by the firwmare
framebuffer), disable runtime pm.  This fixes a regression caused
by commit 55285e21f045 which results in the displays waking up
shortly after they go to sleep due to the device coming out of
runtime suspend and sending a hotplug uevent.

v2: squash in reworked fix from Evan
