iavf: Fix limit of total number of queues to active queues of VF

In the absence of this validation, if the user requests to
configure queues more than the enabled queues, it results in
sending the requested number of queues to the kernel stack
(due to the asynchronous nature of VF response), in which
case the stack might pick a queue to transmit that is not
enabled and result in Tx hang. Fix this bug by
limiting the total number of queues allocated for VF to
active queues of VF.
