sched: adjust sleeper credit for SCHED_IDLE entities

Give reduced sleeper credit to SCHED_IDLE entities. As a result, woken
SCHED_IDLE entities will take longer to preempt normal entities.

The benefit of this change is to make it less likely that a newly woken
SCHED_IDLE entity will preempt a short-running normal entity before it
blocks.

We still give a small sleeper credit to SCHED_IDLE entities, so that
idle<->idle competition retains some fairness.

Example: With HZ=1000, spawned four threads affined to one cpu, one of
which was set to SCHED_IDLE. Without this patch, wakeup latency for the
SCHED_IDLE thread was ~1-2ms, with the patch the wakeup latency was
~5ms.
