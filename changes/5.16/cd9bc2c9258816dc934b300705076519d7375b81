arm64: Recover kretprobe modified return address in stacktrace

Since the kretprobe replaces the function return address with
the kretprobe_trampoline on the stack, stack unwinder shows it
instead of the correct return address.

This checks whether the next return address is the
__kretprobe_trampoline(), and if so, try to find the correct
return address from the kretprobe instance list. For this purpose
this adds 'kr_cur' loop cursor to memorize the current kretprobe
instance.

With this fix, now arm64 can enable
CONFIG_ARCH_CORRECT_STACKTRACE_ON_KRETPROBE, and pass the
kprobe self tests.
