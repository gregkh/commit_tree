fanotify: Support enqueueing of error events

Once an error event is triggered, enqueue it in the notification group,
similarly to what is done for other events.  FAN_FS_ERROR is not
handled specially, since the memory is now handled by a preallocated
mempool.

For now, make the event unhashed.  A future patch implements merging of
this kind of event.
