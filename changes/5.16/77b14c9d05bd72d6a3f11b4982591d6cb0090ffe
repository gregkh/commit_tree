memory: tegra: Remove interconnect state syncing hack

State syncing works properly now, previously the sync callback was never
invoked. Apparently it was fixed in drivers core, so let's remove the
hack. The state won't be synced until all consumer drivers of devices
that reference memory controller in a device-tree are probed, i.e. keeping
bandwidth at maximum until both display and devfreq drivers are probed.
