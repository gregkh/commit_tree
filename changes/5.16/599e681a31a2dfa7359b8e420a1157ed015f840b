dt-bindings: memory: mediatek: Add mt8195 smi sub common

Add the binding for smi-sub-common. The SMI block diagram like this:

        IOMMU
         |  |
      smi-common
  ------------------
  |      ....      |
 larb0           larb7   <-max is 8

The smi-common connects with smi-larb and IOMMU. The maximum larbs number
that connects with a smi-common is 8. If the engines number is over 8,
sometimes we use a smi-sub-common which is nearly same with smi-common.
It supports up to 8 input and 1 output(smi-common has 2 output)

Something like:

        IOMMU
         |  |
      smi-common
  ---------------------
  |      |          ...
larb0  sub-common   ...   <-max is 8
      -----------
       |    |    ...   <-max is 8 too.
     larb2 larb5

We don't need extra SW setting for smi-sub-common, only the sub-common has
special clocks need to enable when the engines access dram.

If it is sub-common, it should have a "mediatek,smi" phandle to point to
its smi-common. meanwhile the sub-common only has one gals clock.
