drm/i915/guc: Take GT PM ref when deregistering context

Taking a PM reference to prevent intel_gt_wait_for_idle from short
circuiting while a deregister context H2G is in flight. To do this must
issue the deregister H2G from a worker as context can be destroyed from
an atomic context and taking GT PM ref blows up. Previously we took a
runtime PM from this atomic context which worked but will stop working
once runtime pm autosuspend in enabled.

So this patch is two fold, stop intel_gt_wait_for_idle from short
circuting and fix runtime pm autosuspend.

v2:
 (John Harrison)
  - Split structure changes out in different patch
 (Tvrtko)
  - Don't drop lock in deregister_destroyed_contexts
v3:
 (John Harrison)
  - Flush destroyed contexts before destroying context reg pool
