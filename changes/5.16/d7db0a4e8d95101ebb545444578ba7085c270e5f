bpftool: Add install-bin target to install binary only

With "make install", bpftool installs its binary and its bash completion
file. Usually, this is what we want. But a few components in the kernel
repository (namely, BPF iterators and selftests) also install bpftool
locally before using it. In such a case, bash completion is not
necessary and is just a useless build artifact.

Let's add an "install-bin" target to bpftool, to offer a way to install
the binary only.
