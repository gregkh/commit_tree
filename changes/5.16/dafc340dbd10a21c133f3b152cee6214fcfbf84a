btrfs: zoned: introduce physical_map to btrfs_block_group

We will use a block group's physical location to track active zones and
finish fully written zones in the following commits. Since the zone
activation is done in the extent allocation context which already holding
the tree locks, we can't query the chunk tree for the physical locations.
So, copy the location info into a block group and use it for activation.
