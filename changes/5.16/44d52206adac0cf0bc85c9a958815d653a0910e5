ARM: dts: sunxi: Rename power-supply names

The name of our PMIC power supply names conflict with the generic
regulator supply check that matches anything called *-supply, including
the nodes, and then makes sure it's a phandle.

A node is obviously not a phandle, so let's change our power supplies
names to avoid any conflict.
