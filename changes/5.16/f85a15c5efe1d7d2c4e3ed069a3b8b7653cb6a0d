mmc: sdhci-omap: Fix build if CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not set

Commit f433e8aac6b9 ("mmc: sdhci-omap: Implement PM runtime functions")
combined the use of runtime PM and system suspend functions but left the
ifdef CONFIG_PM_SLEEP in place causing undeclared identifier error for
sdhci_omap_runtime_suspend if CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not enabled.

Let's fix the error by removing ifdef CONFIG_PM_SLEEP and tagging the
reset of the PM related functions with __maybe_unused.

Let's also remove the forward declaration for sdhci_omap_context_save(),
that was accidentally left from an earlier version and is no longer used.
