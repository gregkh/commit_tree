arm64/sve: Use accessor functions for vector lengths in thread_struct

In a system with SME there are parallel vector length controls for SVE and
SME vectors which function in much the same way so it is desirable to
share the code for handling them as much as possible. In order to prepare
for doing this add a layer of accessor functions for the various VL related
operations on tasks.

Since almost all current interactions are actually via task->thread rather
than directly with the thread_info the accessors use that. Accessors are
provided for both generic and SVE specific usage, the generic accessors
should be used for cases where register state is being manipulated since
the registers are shared between streaming and regular SVE so we know that
when SME support is implemented we will always have to be in the appropriate
mode already and hence can generalise now.

Since we are using task_struct and we don't want to cause widespread
inclusion of sched.h the acessors are all out of line, it is hoped that
none of the uses are in a sufficiently critical path for this to be an
issue. Those that are most likely to present an issue are in the same
translation unit so hopefully the compiler may be able to inline anyway.

This is purely adding the layer of abstraction, additional work will be
needed to support tasks using SME.
