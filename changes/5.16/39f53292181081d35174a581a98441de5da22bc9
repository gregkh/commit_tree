platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Fix WWAN device disabled issue after S3 deep

When WWAN device wake from S3 deep, under thinkpad platform,
WWAN would be disabled. This disable status could be checked
by command 'nmcli r wwan' or 'rfkill list'.

Issue analysis as below:
  When host resume from S3 deep, thinkpad_acpi driver would
call hotkey_resume() function. Finnaly, it will use
wan_get_status to check the current status of WWAN device.
During this resume progress, wan_get_status would always
return off even WWAN boot up completely.
  In patch V2, Hans said 'sw_state should be unchanged
after a suspend/resume. It's better to drop the
tpacpi_rfk_update_swstate call all together from the
resume path'.
  And it's confimed by Lenovo that GWAN is no longer
 available from WHL generation because the design does not
 match with current pin control.
