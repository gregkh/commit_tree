iavf: do not override the adapter state in the watchdog task (again)

The watchdog task incorrectly changes the state to __IAVF_RESETTING,
instead of letting the reset task take care of that. This was already
resolved by commit 22c8fd71d3a5 ("iavf: do not override the adapter
state in the watchdog task") but the problem was reintroduced by the
recent code refactoring in commit 45eebd62999d ("iavf: Refactor iavf
state machine tracking").

Fixes: 45eebd62999d ("iavf: Refactor iavf state machine tracking")
