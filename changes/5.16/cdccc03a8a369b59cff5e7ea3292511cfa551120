btrfs: remove stale comment about the btrfs_show_devname

There were few lockdep warnings because btrfs_show_devname() was using
device_list_mutex as recorded in the commits:

  0ccd05285e7f ("btrfs: fix a possible umount deadlock")
  779bf3fefa83 ("btrfs: fix lock dep warning, move scratch dev out of device_list_mutex and uuid_mutex")

And finally, commit 88c14590cdd6 ("btrfs: use RCU in btrfs_show_devname
for device list traversal") removed the device_list_mutex from
btrfs_show_devname for performance reasons.

This patch removes a stale comment about the function
btrfs_show_devname and device_list_mutex.
