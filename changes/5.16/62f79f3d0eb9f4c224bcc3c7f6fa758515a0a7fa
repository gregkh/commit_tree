fsi: occ: Force sequence numbering per OCC

Set and increment the sequence number during the submit operation.
This prevents sequence number conflicts between different users of
the interface. A sequence number conflict may result in a user
getting an OCC response meant for a different command. Since the
sequence number is now modified, the checksum must be calculated and
set before submitting the command.
