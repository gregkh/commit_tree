dt-bindings: spi: cadence-quadspi: document "intel,socfpga-qspi"

The QSPI controller on Intel's SoCFPGA platform does not implement the
CQSPI_REG_WR_COMPLETION_CTRL register, thus a write to this register
results in a crash.

Introduce the dts compatible "intel,socfpga-qspi" to differentiate the
hardware.
