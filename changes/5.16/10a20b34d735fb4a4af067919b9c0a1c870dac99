of/irq: Don't ignore interrupt-controller when interrupt-map failed

Since 041284181226 ("of/irq: Allow matching of an interrupt-map local
to an interrupt controller"), the irq code favors using an interrupt-map
over a interrupt-controller property if both are available, while the
earlier behaviour was to ignore the interrupt-map altogether.

However, we now end-up with the opposite behaviour, which is to
ignore the interrupt-controller property even if the interrupt-map
fails to match its input. This new behaviour breaks the AmigaOne
X1000 machine, which ships with an extremely "creative" (read:
broken) device tree.

Fix this by allowing the interrupt-controller property to be selected
when interrupt-map fails to match anything.
