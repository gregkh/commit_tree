ptp: ocp: Add IRIG-B and DCF blocks

IRIG (Inter-range Instrumentation Group) timecode format on
one of the SMA output channels is provided by the IRIG master
FPGA block.  Enable the master when the IRIG output format is
selected on either one of the output channels.

By default, the output is in B007 format.

DCF output format is provided by the DCF master block.

Also enable the IRIG and DCF slaves, which parse an incoming
signal from the external SMA connectors, and may be used to
adjust the PHC.
