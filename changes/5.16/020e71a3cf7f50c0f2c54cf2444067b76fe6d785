ipv4: guard IP_MINTTL with a static key

RFC 5082 IP_MINTTL option is rarely used on hosts.

Add a static key to remove from TCP fast path useless code,
and potential cache line miss to fetch inet_sk(sk)->min_ttl

Note that once ip4_min_ttl static key has been enabled,
it stays enabled until next boot.
