media: aspeed-video: ignore interrupts that aren't enabled

As partially addressed in commit 65d270acb2d6 ("media: aspeed: clear
garbage interrupts"), the ASpeed video engine sometimes asserts
interrupts that the driver hasn't enabled.  In addition to the
CAPTURE_COMPLETE and FRAME_COMPLETE interrupts dealt with in that
patch, COMP_READY has also been observed.  Instead of playing
whack-a-mole with each one individually, we can instead just blanket
ignore everything we haven't explicitly enabled.
