ath9k: owl-loader: fetch pci init values through nvmem

extends the owl loader to fetch important pci initialization
values - which are stored together with the calibration data -
through the nvmem subsystem.

This allows for much faster WIFI/ath9k initializations on devices
that do not require to perform any post-processing (like XOR'ing/
reversal or unpacking)... than the current way through the
firmware_request which involves the filesystem/userspace.
