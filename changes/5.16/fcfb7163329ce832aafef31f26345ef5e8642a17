x86/fpu/signal: Move xstate clearing out of copy_fpregs_to_sigframe()

When the direct saving of the FPU registers to the user space sigframe
fails, copy_fpregs_to_sigframe() attempts to clear the user buffer.

The most likely reason for such a fail is a page fault. As
copy_fpregs_to_sigframe() is invoked with pagefaults disabled the chance
that __clear_user() succeeds is minuscule.

Move the clearing out into the caller which replaces the
fault_in_pages_writeable() in that error handling path.

The return value confusion will be cleaned up separately.
