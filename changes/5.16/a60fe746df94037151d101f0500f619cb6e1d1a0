clk: imx: Rework all imx_clk_hw_composite wrappers

Rather than having multiple different macros for each different type
of imx8m_clk_hw_composite, implement them in such a way so we can
take advantage the most of the already defined simpler types. Basically,
we end up having one low-level __imx8m_clk_hw_composite function, a
wrapper to simplify the parents related arguments called
_imx8m_clk_hw_composite and then all the types can use those for each
specific case.
