dt-bindings: mfd: samsung,s2mps11: Convert to dtschema

Convert the MFD part of Samsung S2MPS11/S2MPS13/S2MPS14/S2MPS15/S2MPU02
family of PMICs to DT schema format.  Previously the bindings were
mostly in mfd/samsung,sec-core.txt.

The conversion copies parts of description from existing bindings
therefore the license is not changed from GPLv2.
