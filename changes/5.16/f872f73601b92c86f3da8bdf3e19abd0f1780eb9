thermal: int340x: Fix VCoRefLow MMIO bit offset for TGL

The VCoRefLow CPU FIVR register definition for Tiger Lake is incorrect.

Current implementation reads it from MMIO offset 0x5A18 and bit
offset [12:14], but the actual correct register definition is from
bit offset [11:13].

Update to fix the bit offset.
