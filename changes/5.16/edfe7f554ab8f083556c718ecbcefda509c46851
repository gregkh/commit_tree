perf metric: Use NAN for missing event IDs.

If during computing a metric an event (id) is missing the parsing
aborts. A later patch will make it so that events that aren't used in
the output are deliberately omitted, in which case we don't want the
abort. Modify the missing ID case to report NAN for these cases.
