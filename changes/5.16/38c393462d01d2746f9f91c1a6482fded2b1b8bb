drm/i915/icl/tc: Remove the ICL special casing during TC-cold blocking

While a TypeC port mode is locked a DISPLAY_CORE power domain reference
is held, which implies a runtime PM ref. By removing the ICL !legacy
port special casing, a TC_COLD_OFF power domain reference will be taken
for such ports, which also translates to a runtime PM ref on that
platform. A follow-up change will stop holding the DISPLAY_CORE power
domain while the port is locked.
