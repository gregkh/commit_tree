net: bridge: mdb: move all switchdev logic to br_switchdev.c

The following functions:

br_mdb_complete
br_switchdev_mdb_populate
br_mdb_replay_one
br_mdb_queue_one
br_mdb_replay
br_mdb_switchdev_host_port
br_mdb_switchdev_host
br_switchdev_mdb_notify

are only accessible from code paths where CONFIG_NET_SWITCHDEV is
enabled. So move them to br_switchdev.c, in order for that code to be
compiled out if that config option is disabled.

Note that br_switchdev.c gets build regardless of whether
CONFIG_BRIDGE_IGMP_SNOOPING is enabled or not, whereas br_mdb.c only got
built when CONFIG_BRIDGE_IGMP_SNOOPING was enabled. So to preserve
correct compilation with CONFIG_BRIDGE_IGMP_SNOOPING being disabled, we
must now place an #ifdef around these functions in br_switchdev.c.
The offending bridge data structures that need this are
br->multicast_lock and br->mdb_list, these are also compiled out of
struct net_bridge when CONFIG_BRIDGE_IGMP_SNOOPING is turned off.
