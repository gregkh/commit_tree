selftests: xsk: Replace second_step global variable

Replace the second_step global variable with a test specification
variable called total_steps that a test can be set to indicate how
many times the packet stream should be sent without reinitializing any
sockets. This eliminates test specific code in the test runner around
the bidirectional test.

The total_steps variable is 1 by default as most tests only need a
single round of packets.
