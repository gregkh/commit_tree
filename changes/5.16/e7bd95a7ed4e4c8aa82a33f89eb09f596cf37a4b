drm/edid: Fix crash with zero/invalid EDID

In the commit bac9c2948224 ("drm/edid: Break out reading block 0 of
the EDID") I broke out reading the base block of the EDID to its own
function. Unfortunately, when I did that I messed up the handling when
drm_edid_is_zero() indicated that we had an EDID that was all 0x00 or
when we went through 4 loops and didn't get a valid EDID. Specifically
I needed to pass the broken EDID to connector_bad_edid() but now I was
passing an error-pointer.

Let's re-jigger things so we can pass the bad EDID in properly.
