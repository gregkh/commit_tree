firmware_loader: split built-in firmware call

There are two ways the firmware_loader can use the built-in
firmware: with or without the pre-allocated buffer. We already
have one explicit use case for each of these, and so split them
up so that it is clear what the intention is on the caller side.

This also paves the way so that eventually other callers outside
of the firmware loader can uses these if and when needed.

While at it, adopt the firmware prefix for the routine names.
