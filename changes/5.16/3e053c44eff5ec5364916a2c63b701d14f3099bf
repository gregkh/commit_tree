char: xillybus: Remove usage of remaining deprecated pci_ API

'struct xilly_endpoint' has a 'dev' field which is a 'struct device *' and
a 'pdev' field which is 'struct pci_dev *'.

Both fields are initialized by 'xillybus_init_endpoint()' and in
'xillybus_pcie.c', we have:
	xillybus_init_endpoint(pdev, &pdev->dev, &pci_hw);
                                 ^       ^
        xilly_endpoint.pdev = ___|       |___ = xilly_endpoint.dev
So the modification from pci_ to dma_ function is straightforward.

Update all remaining deprecated pci_ function calls to equivalent
dma_ API function.
Switching from 'ep->pdev' to 'ep->dev' makes the transformation
straightforward.
