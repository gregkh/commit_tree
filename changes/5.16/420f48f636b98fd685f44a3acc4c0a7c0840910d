s390/setup: avoid reserving memory above identity mapping

Such reserved memory region, if not cleaned up later causes problems when
memblock_free_all() is called to release free pages to the buddy allocator
and those reserved regions are carried over to reserve_bootmem_region()
which marks the pages as PageReserved.

Instead use memblock_set_current_limit() to make sure memblock allocations
do not go over identity mapping (which could happen when "mem=" option
is used or during kdump).
