direct-io: remove blk_poll support

The polling support in the legacy direct-io support is a little crufty.
It already doesn't support the asynchronous polling needed for io_uring
polling, and is hard to adopt to upcoming changes in the polling
interfaces.  Given that all the major file systems already use the iomap
direct I/O code, just drop the polling support.
