soc: imx: imx8m-blk-ctrl: Fix imx8mm mipi reset

Most of the blk-ctrl reset bits are found in one register, however
there are two bits in offset 8 for pulling the MIPI DPHY out of reset
and one of them needs to be set when IMX8MM_DISPBLK_PD_MIPI_CSI is brought
out of reset or the MIPI_CSI hangs.

Since MIPI_DSI is impacted, add the additional one for MIPI_DSI too.
