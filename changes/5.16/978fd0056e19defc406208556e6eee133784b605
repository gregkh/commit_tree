PCI: of: Allow matching of an interrupt-map local to a PCI device

Just as we now allow an interrupt map to be parsed when part of an
interrupt controller, there is no reason to ignore an interrupt map that
would be part of a pci device node such as a root port since we already
allow interrupt specifiers.

Allow the matching of such property when local to the node of a PCI
device, which allows the device itself to use the interrupt map for for
its own purpose.
