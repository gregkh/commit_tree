arm64: dts: qcom: Fix IPQ8074 PCIe PHY nodes

IPQ8074 PCIe PHY nodes are broken in the many ways:

- '#address-cells', '#size-cells' and 'ranges' are missing.
- Child phy/lane node is missing, and the child properties like
  '#phy-cells' and 'clocks' are mistakenly put into parent node.
- The clocks properties for parent node are missing.

Fix them to get the nodes comply with the bindings schema.
