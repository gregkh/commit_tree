iommu/vt-d: Clean up unused PASID updating functions

update_pasid() and its call chain are currently unused in the tree because
Thomas disabled the ENQCMD feature. The feature will be re-enabled shortly
using a different approach and update_pasid() and its call chain will not
be used in the new approach.

Remove the useless functions.
