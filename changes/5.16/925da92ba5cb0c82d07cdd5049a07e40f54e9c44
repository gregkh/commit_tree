rcu: Avoid unneeded function call in rcu_read_unlock()

Since commit aa40c138cc8f3 ("rcu: Report QS for outermost PREEMPT=n
rcu_read_unlock() for strict GPs") the function rcu_read_unlock_strict()
is invoked by the inlined rcu_read_unlock() function.  However,
rcu_read_unlock_strict() is an empty function in production kernels,
which are built with CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=n.

There is a mention of rcu_read_unlock_strict() in the BPF verifier,
but this is in a deny-list, meaning that BPF does not care whether
rcu_read_unlock_strict() is ever called.

This commit therefore provides a slight performance improvement
by hoisting the check of CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD from
rcu_read_unlock_strict() into rcu_read_unlock(), thus avoiding the
pointless call to an empty function.
