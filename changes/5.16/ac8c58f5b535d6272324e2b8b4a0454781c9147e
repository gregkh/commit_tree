igb: fix deadlock caused by taking RTNL in RPM resume path

Recent net core changes caused an issue with few Intel drivers
(reportedly igb), where taking RTNL in RPM resume path results in a
deadlock. See [0] for a bug report. I don't think the core changes
are wrong, but taking RTNL in RPM resume path isn't needed.
The Intel drivers are the only ones doing this. See [1] for a
discussion on the issue. Following patch changes the RPM resume path
to not take RTNL.
