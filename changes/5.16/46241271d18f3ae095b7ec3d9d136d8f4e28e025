bpftool: Do not expose and init hash maps for pinned path in main.c

BPF programs, maps, and links, can all be listed with their pinned paths
by bpftool, when the "-f" option is provided. To do so, bpftool builds
hash maps containing all pinned paths for each kind of objects.

These three hash maps are always initialised in main.c, and exposed
through main.h. There appear to be no particular reason to do so: we can
just as well make them static to the files that need them (prog.c,
map.c, and link.c respectively), and initialise them only when we want
to show objects and the "-f" switch is provided.

This may prevent unnecessary memory allocations if the implementation of
the hash maps was to change in the future.
