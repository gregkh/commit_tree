powercap/drivers/dtpm: Simplify the dtpm table

The dtpm table is an array of pointers, that forces the user of the
table to define initdata along with the declaration of the table
entry. It is more efficient to create an array of dtpm structure, so
the declaration of the table entry can be done by initializing the
different fields.
