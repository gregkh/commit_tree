xfs: remove incorrect ASSERT in xfs_rename

This ASSERT in xfs_rename is a) incorrect, because
(RENAME_WHITEOUT|RENAME_NOREPLACE) is a valid combination, and
b) unnecessary, because actual invalid flag combinations are already
handled at the vfs level in do_renameat2() before we get called.
So, remove it.
