s390/sclp: sort out physical vs virtual pointers usage

Provide physical addresses whenever the hardware interface
expects it or a 32-bit value used for tracking.

Variable sclp_early_sccb gets initialized in the decompressor
and points to an address in physcal memory. Yet, it is used
as virtual memory pointer and therefore should be converted.

Note, the other two __bootdata variables sclp_info_sccb and
sclp_info_sccb_valid contain plain data, but no pointers and
do need any special care.
