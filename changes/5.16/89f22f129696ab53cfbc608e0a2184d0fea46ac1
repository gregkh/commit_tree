iavf: free q_vectors before queues in iavf_disable_vf

iavf_free_queues() clears adapter->num_active_queues, which
iavf_free_q_vectors() relies on, so swap the order of these two function
calls in iavf_disable_vf(). This resolves a panic encountered when the
interface is disabled and then later brought up again after PF
communication is restored.
