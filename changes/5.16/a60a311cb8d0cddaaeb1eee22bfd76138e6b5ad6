arm64: dts: renesas: rzg2l-smarc-som: Enable eMMC on SMARC platform

RZ/G2L SoM has both 64 GB eMMC and microSD connected to SDHI0.

Both these interfaces are mutually exclusive and the SD0 device
selection is based on the XOR between GPIO_SD0_DEV_SEL and SW1[2]
switch position.

This patch sets GPIO_SD0_DEV_SEL to high in DT. Use the below switch
setting logic for device selection between eMMC and microSD slot
connected to SDHI0.

Set SW1[2] to position 2/OFF for selecting eMMC
Set SW1[2] to position 3/ON for selecting microSD

This patch enables eMMC on RZ/G2L SMARC platform by default.
