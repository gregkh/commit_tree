irq: openrisc: perform irqentry in entry code

In preparation for removing HANDLE_DOMAIN_IRQ_IRQENTRY, have
arch/openrisc perform all the irqentry accounting in its entry code. As
arch/openrisc uses GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER, we can use
generic_handle_arch_irq() to do so.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
