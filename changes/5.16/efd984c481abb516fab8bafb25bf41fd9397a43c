sched/fair: Add NOHZ balancer flag for nohz.next_balance updates

A following patch will trigger NOHZ idle balances as a means to update
nohz.next_balance. Vincent noted that blocked load updates can have
non-negligible overhead, which should be avoided if the intent is to only
update nohz.next_balance.

Add a new NOHZ balance kick flag, NOHZ_NEXT_KICK. Gate NOHZ blocked load
update by the presence of NOHZ_STATS_KICK - currently all NOHZ balance
kicks will have the NOHZ_STATS_KICK flag set, so no change in behaviour is
expected.
