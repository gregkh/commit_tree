usb: hub: Fix locking issues with address0_mutex

Fix the circular lock dependency and unbalanced unlock of addess0_mutex
introduced when fixing an address0_mutex enumeration retry race in commit
ae6dc22d2d1 ("usb: hub: Fix usb enumeration issue due to address0 race")

Make sure locking order between port_dev->status_lock and address0_mutex
is correct, and that address0_mutex is not unlocked in hub_port_connect
"done:" codepath which may be reached without locking address0_mutex
