kcsan: test: Fix flaky test case

If CONFIG_KCSAN_REPORT_VALUE_CHANGE_ONLY=n, then we may also see data
races between the writers only. If we get unlucky and never capture a
read-write data race, but only the write-write data races, then the
test_no_value_change* test cases may incorrectly fail.

The second problem is that the initial value needs to be reset, as
otherwise we might actually observe a value change at the start.

Fix it by also looking for the write-write data races, and resetting the
value to what will be written.
