libbpf: Skip re-installing headers file if source is older than target

The "install_headers" target in libbpf's Makefile would unconditionally
export all API headers to the target directory. When those headers are
installed to compile another application, this means that make always
finds newer dependencies for the source files relying on those headers,
and deduces that the targets should be rebuilt.

Avoid that by making "install_headers" depend on the source header
files, and (re-)install them only when necessary.
