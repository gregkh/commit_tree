ftrace/x86_64: Have function graph tracer depend on DYNAMIC_FTRACE

The function graph tracer is going to now depend on
ARCH_SUPPORTS_FTRACE_OPS, as that also means that it can support ftrace
args. Since ARCH_SUPPORTS_FTRACE_OPS depends on DYNAMIC_FTRACE, this
means that the function graph tracer for x86_64 will need to depend on
DYNAMIC_FTRACE.
