selftests/vm/transhuge-stress: fix ram size thinko

When executing transhuge-stress with an argument to specify the virtual
memory size for testing, the ram size is reported as 0, e.g.

  transhuge-stress 384
  thp-mmap: allocate 192 transhuge pages, using 384 MiB virtual memory and 0 MiB of ram
  thp-mmap: 0.184 s/loop, 0.957 ms/page,   2090.265 MiB/s  192 succeed,    0 failed

This appears to be due to a thinko in commit 0085d61fe05e
("selftests/vm/transhuge-stress: stress test for memory compaction"),
where, at a guess, the intent was to base "xyz MiB of ram" on `ram`
size.

Here are results after using `ram` size:

  thp-mmap: allocate 192 transhuge pages, using 384 MiB virtual memory and 14 MiB of ram
