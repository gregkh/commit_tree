net: ipa: disable HOLB drop when updating timer

The head-of-line blocking timer should only be modified when
head-of-line drop is disabled.

One of the steps in recovering from a modem crash is to enable
dropping of packets with timeout of 0 (immediate).  We don't know
how the modem configured its endpoints, so before we program the
timer, we need to ensure HOL_BLOCK is disabled.
