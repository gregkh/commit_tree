ravb: Add support for RZ/G2L SoC

RZ/G2L SoC has Gigabit Ethernet IP consisting of Ethernet controller
(E-MAC), Internal TCP/IP Offload Engine (TOE) and Dedicated Direct
memory access controller (DMAC).

This patch adds compatible string for RZ/G2L and fills up the
ravb_hw_info struct. Function stubs are added which will be used by
gbeth_hw_info and will be filled incrementally.
