apparmor: fix error check

clang static analysis reports this representative problem:

label.c:1463:16: warning: Assigned value is garbage or undefined
        label->hname = name;
                     ^ ~~~~

In aa_update_label_name(), this the problem block of code

	if (aa_label_acntsxprint(&name, ...) == -1)
		return res;

On failure, aa_label_acntsxprint() has a more complicated return
that just -1.  So check for a negative return.

It was also noted that the aa_label_acntsxprint() main comment refers
to a nonexistent parameter, so clean up the comment.
