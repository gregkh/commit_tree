arm64/sve: Make access to FFR optional

SME introduces streaming SVE mode in which FFR is not present and the
instructions for accessing it UNDEF. In preparation for handling this
update the low level SVE state access functions to take a flag specifying
if FFR should be handled. When saving the register state we store a zero
for FFR to guard against uninitialized data being read. No behaviour change
should be introduced by this patch.
