virtchnl: Use the BIT() macro for capability/offload flags

Currently raw hex values are used to define specific bits for each
capability/offload in virtchnl.h. Using raw hex values makes it
unclear which bits are used/available. Fix this by using the BIT()
macro so it's immediately obvious which bits are used/available.

Also, move the VIRTCHNL_VF_CAP_ADV_LINK_SPEED define in the correct
place to line up with the other bit values and add a comment for its
purpose.
