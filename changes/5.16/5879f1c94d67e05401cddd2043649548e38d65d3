Documentation: dyndbg: Improve cli param examples

Jim pointed out that using $module.dyndbg= is always a more flexible
choice for using dynamic debug on the command line. The $module.dyndbg
style is checked at boot and handles if $module is a builtin. If it is
actually a loadable module, it is handled again later when the module is
loaded.

If you just use dyndbg="module $module +p" dynamic debug is only enabled
when $module is a builtin.

It was recommended to illustrate wildcard usage as well.
