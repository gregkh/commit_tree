KVM: vPMU: Fill get_msr MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_OVF_CTRL w/ 0

SDM section 18.2.3 mentioned that:

  "IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_OVF_CTL MSR allows software to clear overflow indicator(s) of
   any general-purpose or fixed-function counters via a single WRMSR."

It is R/W mentioned by SDM, we read this msr on bare-metal during perf testing,
the value is always 0 for ICX/SKX boxes on hands. Let's fill get_msr
MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_OVF_CTRL w/ 0 as hardware behavior and drop
global_ovf_ctrl variable.
