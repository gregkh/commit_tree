scsi: avoid to quiesce sdev->request_queue two times

For fixing queue quiesce race between driver and block layer(elevator
switch, update nr_requests, ...), we need to support concurrent quiesce
and unquiesce, which requires the two to be balanced.

blk_mq_quiesce_queue() calls blk_mq_quiesce_queue_nowait() for updating
quiesce depth and marking the flag, then scsi_internal_device_block() calls
blk_mq_quiesce_queue_nowait() two times actually.

Fix the double quiesce and keep quiesce and unquiesce balanced.
