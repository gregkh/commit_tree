ath11k: Fix inaccessible debug registers

Current code clears debug registers after SOC global reset performed
in ath11k_pci_sw_reset. However at that time those registers are
not accessible due to reset, thus they are actually not cleared at all.
For WCN6855, it may cause target fail to initialize. This issue can be
fixed by moving clear action ahead.

In addition, on some specific platforms, need to add delay to wait
those registers to become accessible.

Tested-on: WCN6855 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HSP.1.1-01720.1-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-1
