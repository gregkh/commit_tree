kprobes: treewide: Make it harder to refer kretprobe_trampoline directly

Since now there is kretprobe_trampoline_addr() for referring the
address of kretprobe trampoline code, we don't need to access
kretprobe_trampoline directly.

Make it harder to refer by renaming it to __kretprobe_trampoline().
