misc: fastrpc: Update number of max fastrpc sessions

For latest chipsets, upto 13 fastrpc sessions can be
supported. This includes 12 compute sessions and 1 cpz
session. Not updating this might result to out of bounds
memory access issues if more than 9 context bank nodes
are added to the DT file.
