Documentation/no_hz: Introduce "dyntick-idle mode" before using it

The CONFIG_NO_HZ_IDLE paragraph is using "dyntick-idle mode" before
having defined it while the definition comes a couple of paragraphs
later.

That is leaving the reader with scratching head what that dyntick-idle
mode might be. Pull its definition up so that it is clear.
