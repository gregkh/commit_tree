media: omap_vout: use dma_addr_t consistently

gcc notices that the driver mixes 'dma_addr_t' 'u8 *' and 'u32'
to store DMA addresses:

drivers/media/platform/omap/omap_vout.c: In function 'omap_vout_vb2_prepare':
drivers/media/platform/omap/omap_vout.c:979:37: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]
  vout->queued_buf_addr[vb->index] = (u8 *)buf_phy_addr;
                                     ^
drivers/media/platform/omap/omap_vout.c: In function 'omap_vout_create_video_devices':
drivers/media/platform/omap/omap_vout.c:1479:21: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]
   vout->fbuf.base = (void *)info.paddr;

Use dma_addr_t everywhere here to avoid the type conversions and document
what the address is used for. Assigning to vout->fbuf.base still requires
a cast, since that is part of the driver independent data structure.
