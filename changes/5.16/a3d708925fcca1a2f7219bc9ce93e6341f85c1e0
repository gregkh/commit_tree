net: tulip: winbond-840: fix build for UML

On i386, when builtin (not a loadable module), the winbond-840 driver
inspects boot_cpu_data to see what CPU family it is running on, and
then acts on that data. The "family" struct member (x86) does not exist
when running on UML, so prevent that test and do the default action.

Prevents this build error on UML + i386:

../drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/winbond-840.c: In function ‘init_registers’:
../drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/winbond-840.c:882:19: error: ‘struct cpuinfo_um’ has no member named ‘x86’
  if (boot_cpu_data.x86 <= 4) {
