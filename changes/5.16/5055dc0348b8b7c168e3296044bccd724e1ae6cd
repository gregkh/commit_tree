net: ena: Fix error handling when calculating max IO queues number

The role of ena_calc_max_io_queue_num() is to return the number
of queues supported by the device, which means the return value
should be >=0.

The function that calls ena_calc_max_io_queue_num(), checks
the return value. If it is 0, it means the device reported
it supports 0 IO queues. This case is considered an error
and is handled by the calling function accordingly.

However the current implementation of ena_calc_max_io_queue_num()
is wrong, since when it detects the device supports 0 IO queues,
it returns -EFAULT.

In such a case the calling function doesn't detect the error,
and therefore doesn't handle it.

This commit changes ena_calc_max_io_queue_num() to return 0
in case the device reported it supports 0 queues, allowing the
calling function to properly handle the error case.
