xsk: Fix clang build error in __xp_alloc

Fix a build error with clang in __xp_alloc():

  [...]
  net/xdp/xsk_buff_pool.c:465:15: error: variable 'xskb' is uninitialized
  when used here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
                          xp_release(xskb);
                                     ^~~~

This is correctly detected by clang, but not gcc. In fact, the xp_release()
statement should not be there at all in the refactored code, just remove it.
