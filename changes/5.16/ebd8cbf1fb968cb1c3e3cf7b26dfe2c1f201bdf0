drm/panel: s6d27a1: Add driver for Samsung S6D27A1 display panel

This adds a driver for Samsung S6D27A1 display controller and panel.
This panel is found in the Samsung GT-I8160 mobile phone,
and possibly some other mobile phones.

This display needs manufacturer commands to configure it;
the commands used in this driver were taken from downstream driver
by Gareth Phillips; sadly, there is almost no documentation on what they
actually do.

This driver re-uses the DBI infrastructure to communicate with the display.

This driver is heavily based on WideChips WS2401 display controller
driver by Linus Walleij and on other panel drivers for reference.
