selftests: netfilter: add a vrf+conntrack testcase

Rework the reproducer for the vrf+conntrack regression reported
by Eugene into a selftest and also add a test for ip masquerading
that Lahav fixed recently.

With net or net-next tree, the first test fails and the latter
two pass.

With 09e856d54bda5f28 ("vrf: Reset skb conntrack connection on VRF rcv")
reverted first test passes but the last two fail.

A proper fix needs more work, for time being a revert seems to be
the best choice, snat/masquerade did not work before the fix.
