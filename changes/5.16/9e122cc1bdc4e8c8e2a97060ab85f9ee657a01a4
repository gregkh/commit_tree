memory-hotplug.rst: document the "auto-movable" online policy

Commit e83a437faa62 ("mm/memory_hotplug: introduce "auto-movable" online
policy") introduced a new memory online policy to automatically select a
zone for memory blocks to be onlined.  It added a way to set the active
online policy and tunables for the auto-movable online policy.

Follow-up commits tweaked the "auto-movable" policy to also consider
memory device details when selecting zones for memory blocks to be
onlined.

Let's document the new toggles and how the two online policies we have
work.
