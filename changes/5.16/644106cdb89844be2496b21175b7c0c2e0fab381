power: reset: ltc2952: Fix use of floating point literals

A new commit in LLVM causes an error on the use of 'long double' when
'-mno-x87' is used, which the kernel does through an alias,
'-mno-80387' (see the LLVM commit below for more details around why it
does this).

drivers/power/reset/ltc2952-poweroff.c:162:28: error: expression requires  'long double' type support, but target 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' does not support it
        data->wde_interval = 300L * 1E6L;

                                               ^
3 errors generated.

This happens due to the use of a 'long double' literal. The 'E6' part of
'1E6L' causes the literal to be a 'double' then the 'L' suffix promotes
it to 'long double'.

There is no visible reason for floating point values in this driver, as
the values are only assigned to integer types. Use NSEC_PER_MSEC, which
is the same integer value as '1E6L', to avoid changing functionality but
fix the error.
