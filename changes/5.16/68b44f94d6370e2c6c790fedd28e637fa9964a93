powerpc/booke: Disable STRICT_KERNEL_RWX, DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and KFENCE

fsl_booke and 44x are not able to map kernel linear memory with
pages, so they can't support DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and KFENCE, and
STRICT_KERNEL_RWX is also a problem for now.

Enable those only on book3s (both 32 and 64 except KFENCE), 8xx and 40x.

Fixes: 88df6e90fa97 ("[POWERPC] DEBUG_PAGEALLOC for 32-bit")
Fixes: 95902e6c8864 ("powerpc/mm: Implement STRICT_KERNEL_RWX on PPC32")
Fixes: 90cbac0e995d ("powerpc: Enable KFENCE for PPC32")
