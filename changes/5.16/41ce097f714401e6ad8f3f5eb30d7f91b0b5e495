MIPS: use 3-level pgtable for 64KB page size on MIPS_VA_BITS_48

It hangup when booting Loongson 3A1000 with BOTH
CONFIG_PAGE_SIZE_64KB and CONFIG_MIPS_VA_BITS_48, that it turn
out to use 2-level pgtable instead of 3-level. 64KB page size
with 2-level pgtable only cover 42 bits VA, use 3-level pgtable
to cover all 48 bits VA(55 bits)
