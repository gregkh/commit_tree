userfaultfd/selftests: fix hugetlb area allocations

Currently, userfaultfd selftest for hugetlb as run from run_vmtests.sh
or any environment where there are 'just enough' hugetlb pages will
always fail with:

  testing events (fork, remap, remove):
		ERROR: UFFDIO_COPY error: -12 (errno=12, line=616)

The ENOMEM error code implies there are not enough hugetlb pages.
However, there are free hugetlb pages but they are all reserved.  There
is a basic problem with the way the test allocates hugetlb pages which
has existed since the test was originally written.

Due to the way 'cleanup' was done between different phases of the test,
this issue was masked until recently.  The issue was uncovered by commit
8ba6e8640844 ("userfaultfd/selftests: reinitialize test context in each
test").

For the hugetlb test, src and dst areas are allocated as PRIVATE
mappings of a hugetlb file.  This means that at mmap time, pages are
reserved for the src and dst areas.  At the start of event testing (and
other tests) the src area is populated which results in allocation of
huge pages to fill the area and consumption of reserves associated with
the area.  Then, a child is forked to fault in the dst area.  Note that
the dst area was allocated in the parent and hence the parent owns the
reserves associated with the mapping.  The child has normal access to
the dst area, but can not use the reserves created/owned by the parent.
Thus, if there are no other huge pages available allocation of a page
for the dst by the child will fail.

Fix by not creating reserves for the dst area.  In this way the child
can use free (non-reserved) pages.

Also, MAP_PRIVATE of a file only makes sense if you are interested in
the contents of the file before making a COW copy.  The test does not do
this.  So, just use MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_HUGETLB to create an anonymous
hugetlb mapping.  There is no need to create a hugetlb file in the
non-shared case.
