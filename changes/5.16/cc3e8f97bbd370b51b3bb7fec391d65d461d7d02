clk: renesas: r8a779a0: Add Z0 and Z1 clock support

Add support for the Z0 and Z1 (Cortex-A76 Sub-system 0 and 1) clocks,
based on the existing support for Z clocks on R-Car Gen3.

As the offsets of the CPG_FRQCRB and CPG_FRQCRC registers on R-Car V3U
differ from the offsets on other R-Car Gen3 SoCs, we cannot use the
existing R-Car Gen3 support as-is.  For now, just make a copy, and
change the register offsets.
