net/mlx5e: Check action fwd/drop flag exists also for nic flows

The driver should add offloaded rules with either a fwd or drop action.
The check existed in parsing fdb flows but not when parsing nic flows.
Move the test into actions_match_supported() which is called for
checking nic flows and fdb flows.
