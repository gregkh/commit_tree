drivers/perf: Improve build test coverage

Improve build test cover by allowing some drivers to build under
COMPILE_TEST where possible.

Some notes:
- Mostly a dependency on CONFIG_ACPI is not really required for only
  building (but left untouched), but is required for TX2 which uses ACPI
  functions which have no stubs
- XGENE required 64b dependency as it relies on some unsigned long perf
  struct fields being 64b
- I don't see why TX2 requires NUMA to build, but left untouched
- Added an explicit dependency on GENERIC_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN for
  ARM_SMMU_V3_PMU, which is required for platform MSI functions
