ibmvnic: drop bad optimization in reuse_tx_pools()

When trying to decide whether or not reuse existing rx/tx pools
we tried to allow a range of values for the pool parameters rather
than exact matches. This was intended to reuse the resources for
instance when switching between two VIO servers with different
default parameters.

But this optimization is incomplete and breaks when we try to
change the number of queues for instance. The optimization needs
to be updated, so drop it for now and simplify the code.
