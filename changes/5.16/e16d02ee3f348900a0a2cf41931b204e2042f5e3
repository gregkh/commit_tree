s390: introduce text_poke_sync()

Introduce a text_poke_sync() similar to what x86 has. This can be
used to execute a serializing instruction on all CPUs (including
the current one).

Note: according to the Principles of Operation an IPI (= interrupt)
will already serialize a CPU, however it is better to be explicit. In
addition on_each_cpu() makes sure that also the current CPU get
serialized - just to make sure that possible preemption can prevent
some theoretical case where a CPU will not be serialized.

Therefore text_poke_sync() has to be used whenever code got modified,
just to avoid to rely on implicit serialization.

Also introduce text_poke_sync_lock() which will also disable CPU
hotplug, to prevent that any CPU is just going online with a
prefetched old version of a modified instruction.
