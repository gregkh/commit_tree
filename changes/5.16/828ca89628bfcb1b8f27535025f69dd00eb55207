KVM: x86: Expose TSC offset controls to userspace

To date, VMM-directed TSC synchronization and migration has been a bit
messy. KVM has some baked-in heuristics around TSC writes to infer if
the VMM is attempting to synchronize. This is problematic, as it depends
on host userspace writing to the guest's TSC within 1 second of the last
write.

A much cleaner approach to configuring the guest's views of the TSC is to
simply migrate the TSC offset for every vCPU. Offsets are idempotent,
and thus not subject to change depending on when the VMM actually
reads/writes values from/to KVM. The VMM can then read the TSC once with
KVM_GET_CLOCK to capture a (realtime, host_tsc) pair at the instant when
the guest is paused.
