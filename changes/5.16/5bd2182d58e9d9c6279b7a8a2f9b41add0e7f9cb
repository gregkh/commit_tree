audit,io_uring,io-wq: add some basic audit support to io_uring

This patch adds basic auditing to io_uring operations, regardless of
their context.  This is accomplished by allocating audit_context
structures for the io-wq worker and io_uring SQPOLL kernel threads
as well as explicitly auditing the io_uring operations in
io_issue_sqe().  Individual io_uring operations can bypass auditing
through the "audit_skip" field in the struct io_op_def definition for
the operation; although great care must be taken so that security
relevant io_uring operations do not bypass auditing; please contact
the audit mailing list (see the MAINTAINERS file) with any questions.

The io_uring operations are audited using a new AUDIT_URINGOP record,
an example is shown below:

  type=UNKNOWN[1336] msg=audit(1631800225.981:37289):
    uring_op=19 success=yes exit=0 items=0 ppid=15454 pid=15681
    uid=0 gid=0 euid=0 suid=0 fsuid=0 egid=0 sgid=0 fsgid=0
    subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
    key=(null)

Thanks to Richard Guy Briggs for review and feedback.
