mm/page_alloc.c: avoid allocating highmem pages via alloc_pages_exact[_nid]

Don't use with __GFP_HIGHMEM because page_address() cannot represent
highmem pages without kmap().  Newly allocated pages would leak as
page_address() will return NULL for highmem pages here.  But It works
now because the callers do not specify __GFP_HIGHMEM now.
