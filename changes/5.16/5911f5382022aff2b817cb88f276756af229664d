btrfs: zoned: clear data relocation bg on zone finish

When finishing a zone that is used by a dedicated data relocation
block group, also remove its reference from fs_info, so we're not trying
to use a full block group for allocations during data relocation, which
will always fail.

The result is we're not making any forward progress and end up in a
deadlock situation.
