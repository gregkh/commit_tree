fuse: don't bump attr_version in cached write

The attribute version in fuse_inode should be updated whenever the
attributes might have changed on the server.  In case of cached writes this
is not the case, so updating the attr_version is unnecessary and could
possibly affect performance.

Open code the remaining part of fuse_write_update_size().
