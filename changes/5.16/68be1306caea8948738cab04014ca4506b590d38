KVM: x86/mmu: Fold rmap_recycle into rmap_add

Consolidate rmap_recycle and rmap_add into a single function since they
are only ever called together (and only from one place). This has a nice
side effect of eliminating an extra kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_memslot(). In
addition it makes mmu_set_spte(), which is a very long function, a
little shorter.

No functional change intended.
