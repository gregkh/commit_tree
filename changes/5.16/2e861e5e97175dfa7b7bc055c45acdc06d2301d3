dissector: do not set invalid PPP protocol

The following flower filter fails to match non-PPP_IP{V6} packets
wrapped in PPP_SES protocol:

tc filter add dev eth0 ingress protocol ppp_ses flower \
        action simple sdata hi64

The reason is that proto local variable is being set even when
FLOW_DISSECT_RET_OUT_BAD status is returned.

The fix is to avoid setting proto variable if the PPP protocol is unknown.
