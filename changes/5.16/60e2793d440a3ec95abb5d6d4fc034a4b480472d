mm, oom: do not trigger out_of_memory from the #PF

Any allocation failure during the #PF path will return with VM_FAULT_OOM
which in turn results in pagefault_out_of_memory.  This can happen for 2
different reasons.  a) Memcg is out of memory and we rely on
mem_cgroup_oom_synchronize to perform the memcg OOM handling or b)
normal allocation fails.

The latter is quite problematic because allocation paths already trigger
out_of_memory and the page allocator tries really hard to not fail
allocations.  Anyway, if the OOM killer has been already invoked there
is no reason to invoke it again from the #PF path.  Especially when the
OOM condition might be gone by that time and we have no way to find out
other than allocate.

Moreover if the allocation failed and the OOM killer hasn't been invoked
then we are unlikely to do the right thing from the #PF context because
we have already lost the allocation context and restictions and
therefore might oom kill a task from a different NUMA domain.

This all suggests that there is no legitimate reason to trigger
out_of_memory from pagefault_out_of_memory so drop it.  Just to be sure
that no #PF path returns with VM_FAULT_OOM without allocation print a
warning that this is happening before we restart the #PF.

[VvS: #PF allocation can hit into limit of cgroup v1 kmem controller.
This is a local problem related to memcg, however, it causes unnecessary
global OOM kills that are repeated over and over again and escalate into a
real disaster.  This has been broken since kmem accounting has been
introduced for cgroup v1 (3.8).  There was no kmem specific reclaim for
the separate limit so the only way to handle kmem hard limit was to return
with ENOMEM.  In upstream the problem will be fixed by removing the
outdated kmem limit, however stable and LTS kernels cannot do it and are
still affected.  This patch fixes the problem and should be backported
into stable/LTS.]
