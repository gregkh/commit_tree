objtool: Fix pv_ops noinstr validation

Boris reported that in one of his randconfig builds, objtool got
infinitely stuck. Turns out there's trivial list corruption in the
pv_ops tracking when a function is both in a static table and in a code
assignment.

Avoid re-adding function to the pv_ops[] lists when they're already on
it.
