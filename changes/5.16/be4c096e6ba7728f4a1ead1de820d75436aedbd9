arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Base homestar's power coefficients in reality

The commit 82ea7d411d43 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Base dynamic CPU
power coefficients in reality") and the commit be0416a3f917 ("arm64:
dts: qcom: Add sc7180-trogdor-homestar") passed each other in the
tubes that make up the Internet. Despite the fact the patches didn't
cause a merge conflict, they need to account for each other. Do that.

Fixes: be0416a3f917 ("arm64: dts: qcom: Add sc7180-trogdor-homestar")
