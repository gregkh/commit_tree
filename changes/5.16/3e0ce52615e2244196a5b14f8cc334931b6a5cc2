dt-bindings: hwmon: lm90: do not require VCC supply

The LM90-like sensors usually need VCC supply, however this can be
hard-wired to the board main supply (like in SiFive HiFive Unmatched
RISC-V board).  Original bindings made VCC supply as required but in
practice several other boards skipped it.  Make it optional.
