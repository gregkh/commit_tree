crypto: aesni - check walk.nbytes instead of err

In the code for xts_crypt(), we check for the err value returned by
skcipher_walk_virt() and return from the function if it is non zero.
However, skcipher_walk_virt() can set walk.nbytes to 0, which would cause
us to call kernel_fpu_begin(), and then skip the kernel_fpu_end() call.

This patch checks for the walk.nbytes value instead, and returns if
walk.nbytes is 0. This prevents us from calling kernel_fpu_begin() in
the first place and also covers the case of having a non zero err value
returned from skcipher_walk_virt().
