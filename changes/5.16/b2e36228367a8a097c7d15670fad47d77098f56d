coda: avoid hidden code duplication in rename

We were actually fixing up the directory mtime in both branches after the
negative dentry test, it was just that one branch was only flagging the
directory inodes to refresh their attributes while the other branch used
the optional optimization to set mtime to the current time and not go back
to the Coda client.
