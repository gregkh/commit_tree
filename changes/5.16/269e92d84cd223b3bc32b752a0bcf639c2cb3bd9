drm/msm/dp: Allow specifying connector_type per controller

As the following patches introduced support for multiple DP blocks in a
platform and some of those block might be eDP it becomes useful to be
able to specify the connector type per block.

Although there's only a single block at this point, the array of descs
and the search in dp_display_get_desc() are introduced here to simplify
the next patch, that does introduce support for multiple DP blocks.
