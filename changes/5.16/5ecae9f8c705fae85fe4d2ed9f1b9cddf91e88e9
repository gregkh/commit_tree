scsi: mpt3sas: Fix incorrect system timestamp

For updating the IOC firmware's timestamp with system timestamp, the driver
issues the Mpi26IoUnitControlRequest message. While framing the
Mpi26IoUnitControlRequest, the driver should copy the lower 32 bits of the
current timestamp into IOCParameterValue field and the higher 32 bits into
Reserved7 field.
