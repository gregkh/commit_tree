tpm_tis_spi: Add missing SPI ID

In commit c46ed2281bbe ("tpm_tis_spi: add missing SPI device ID entries")
we added SPI IDs for all the DT aliases to handle the fact that we always
use SPI modaliases to load modules even when probed via DT however the
mentioned commit missed that the SPI and OF device ID entries did not
match and were different and so DT nodes with compatible
"tcg,tpm_tis-spi" will not match.  Add an extra ID for tpm_tis-spi
rather than just fix the existing one since what's currently there is
going to be better for anyone actually using SPI IDs to instantiate.

Fixes: 96c8395e2166 ("spi: Revert modalias changes")
