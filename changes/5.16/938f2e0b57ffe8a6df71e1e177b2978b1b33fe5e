batman-adv: mcast: don't send link-local multicast to mcast routers

The addition of routable multicast TX handling introduced a
bug/regression for packets with a link-local multicast destination:
These packets would be sent to all batman-adv nodes with a multicast
router and to all batman-adv nodes with an old version without multicast
router detection.

This even disregards the batman-adv multicast fanout setting, which can
potentially lead to an unwanted, high number of unicast transmissions or
even congestion.

Fixing this by avoiding to send link-local multicast packets to nodes in
the multicast router list.
