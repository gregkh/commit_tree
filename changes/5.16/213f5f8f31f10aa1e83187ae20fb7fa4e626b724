ipv4: convert fib_num_tclassid_users to atomic_t

Before commit faa041a40b9f ("ipv4: Create cleanup helper for fib_nh")
changes to net->ipv4.fib_num_tclassid_users were protected by RTNL.

After the change, this is no longer the case, as free_fib_info_rcu()
runs after rcu grace period, without rtnl being held.
