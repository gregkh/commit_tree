x86/perf: Fix snapshot_branch_stack warning in VM

When running in VM intel_pmu_snapshot_branch_stack triggers WRMSR warning
like:

 [ ] unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0x3f1 (tried to write 0x0000000000000000) at rIP: 0xffffffff81011a5b (intel_pmu_snapshot_branch_stack+0x3b/0xd0)

This can be triggered with BPF selftests:

  tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_progs -t get_branch_snapshot

This warning is caused by __intel_pmu_pebs_disable_all() in the VM.
Since it is not necessary to disable PEBS for LBR, remove it from
intel_pmu_snapshot_branch_stack and intel_pmu_snapshot_arch_branch_stack.
