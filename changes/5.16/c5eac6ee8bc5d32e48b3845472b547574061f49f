tracing/histogram: Simplify handling of .sym-offset in expressions

The '-' in .sym-offset can confuse the hist trigger arithmetic
expression parsing. Simplify the handling of this by replacing the
'sym-offset' with 'symXoffset'. This allows us to correctly evaluate
expressions where the user may have inadvertently added a .sym-offset
modifier to one of the operands in an expression, instead of bailing
out. In this case the .sym-offset has no effect on the evaluation of the
expression. The only valid use of the .sym-offset is as a hist key
modifier.
