staging: r8188eu: don't accept SIGTERM for cmd thread

At the moment, our command thread can be killed by user space.

[root@host ]# kill `pidof RTW_CMD_THREAD`

The driver will then stop working until the module is unloaded
and reloaded.

Don't process SIGTERM in the command thread. Other drivers that have a
command thread don't process SIGTERM either.
