counter: Implement events_queue_size sysfs attribute

The events_queue_size sysfs attribute provides a way for users to
dynamically configure the Counter events queue size for the Counter
character device interface. The size is in number of struct
counter_event data structures. The number of elements will be rounded-up
to a power of 2 due to a requirement of the kfifo_alloc function called
during reallocation of the queue.
