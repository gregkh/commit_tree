platform/x86: amd-pmc: Export Idlemask values based on the APU

IdleMask is the metric used by the PM firmware to know the status of each

Knowing this value is key to get the information of s2idle suspend/resume
status. This value is mapped to PMC scratch registers, retrieve them
accordingly based on the CPU family and the underlying firmware support.
