vmalloc: choose a better start address in vm_area_register_early()

Percpu embedded first chunk allocator is the firstly option, but it
could fail on ARM64, eg,

  percpu: max_distance=0x5fcfdc640000 too large for vmalloc space 0x781fefff0000
  percpu: max_distance=0x600000540000 too large for vmalloc space 0x7dffb7ff0000
  percpu: max_distance=0x5fff9adb0000 too large for vmalloc space 0x5dffb7ff0000

then we could get to

  WARNING: CPU: 15 PID: 461 at vmalloc.c:3087 pcpu_get_vm_areas+0x488/0x838

and the system cannot boot successfully.

Let's implement page mapping percpu first chunk allocator as a fallback
to the embedding allocator to increase the robustness of the system.

Also fix a crash when both NEED_PER_CPU_PAGE_FIRST_CHUNK and
KASAN_VMALLOC enabled.

Tested on ARM64 qemu with cmdline "percpu_alloc=page".

This patch (of 3):

There are some fixed locations in the vmalloc area be reserved in
ARM(see iotable_init()) and ARM64(see map_kernel()), but for
pcpu_page_first_chunk(), it calls vm_area_register_early() and choose
VMALLOC_START as the start address of vmap area which could be
conflicted with above address, then could trigger a BUG_ON in
vm_area_add_early().

Let's choose a suit start address by traversing the vmlist.
