drm/i915/bios: use ddc pin directly from child data

Avoid extra caching of the data. This is slightly more subtle than one
would think. For one thing, we explicitly ignore 0 value in child device
ddc pin; this is specified as N/A and does not warrant a warning. For
another, we start looking for ddc pin collisions in sanitize using
unmapped pin numbering.

v2: Check !devdata in intel_bios_alternate_ddc_pin()
