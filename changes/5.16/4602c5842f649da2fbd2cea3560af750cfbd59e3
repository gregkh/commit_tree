optee: refactor driver with internal callbacks

The OP-TEE driver is refactored with three internal callbacks replacing
direct calls to optee_from_msg_param(), optee_to_msg_param() and
optee_do_call_with_arg().

These functions a central to communicating with OP-TEE in secure world
by using the SMC Calling Convention directly.

This refactoring makes room for using other primitives to communicate
with OP-TEE in secure world while being able to reuse as much as
possible from the present driver.
