selftests: Fix raw socket bind tests with VRF

Commit referenced below added negative socket bind tests for VRF. The
socket binds should fail since the address to bind to is in a VRF yet
the socket is not bound to the VRF or a device within it. Update the
expected return code to check for 1 (bind failure) so the test passes
when the bind fails as expected. Add a 'show_hint' comment to explain
why the bind is expected to fail.
