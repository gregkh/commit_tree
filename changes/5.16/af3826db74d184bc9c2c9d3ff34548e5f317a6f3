octeontx2-pf: Use hardware register for CQE count

Current driver uses software CQ head pointer to poll on CQE
header in memory to determine if CQE is valid. Software needs
to make sure, that the reads of the CQE do not get re-ordered
so much that it ends up with an inconsistent view of the CQE.
To ensure that DMB barrier after read to first CQE cacheline
and before reading of the rest of the CQE is needed.
But having barrier for every CQE read will impact the performance,
instead use hardware CQ head and tail pointers to find the
valid number of CQEs.
