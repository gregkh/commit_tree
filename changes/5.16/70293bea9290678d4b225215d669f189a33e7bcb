arm64: dts: ls1028a: disable usb controller by default

One of the last devices which are enabled by default are the USB
controllers. Although the pins are not multi-function pins, some boards
might not use USB at all. Apply the "disabled-by-default" style also for
the USB controllers and enable the controllers in the actual device tree
of the boards.
