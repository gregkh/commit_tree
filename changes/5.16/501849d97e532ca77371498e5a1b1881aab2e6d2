ASoC: samsung: add missing "fallthrough;"

With gcc, we get a warning in this file:

In file included from include/linux/io.h:13,
                 from sound/soc/samsung/s3c-i2s-v2.c:16:

From all I can tell, this was indeed meant to fall through, so
add "fallthrough;" statement to avoid the warning.
