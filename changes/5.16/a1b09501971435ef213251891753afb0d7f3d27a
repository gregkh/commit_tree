irq: add generic_handle_arch_irq()

Several architectures select GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER and branch to
handle_arch_irq() without performing any entry accounting.

Add a generic wrapper to handle the common irqentry work when invoking
handle_arch_irq(). Where an architecture needs to perform some entry
accounting itself, it will need to invoke handle_arch_irq() itself.

In subsequent patches it will become the responsibilty of the entry code
to set the irq regs when entering an IRQ (rather than deferring this to
an irqchip handler), so generic_handle_arch_irq() is made to set the irq
regs now. This can be redundant in some cases, but is never harmful as
saving/restoring the old regs nests safely.
