bpf: Rename BTF_KIND_TAG to BTF_KIND_DECL_TAG

Patch set [1] introduced BTF_KIND_TAG to allow tagging
declarations for struct/union, struct/union field, var, func
and func arguments and these tags will be encoded into
dwarf. They are also encoded to btf by llvm for the bpf target.

After BTF_KIND_TAG is introduced, we intended to use it
for kernel __user attributes. But kernel __user is actually
a type attribute. Upstream and internal discussion showed
it is not a good idea to mix declaration attribute and
type attribute. So we proposed to introduce btf_type_tag
as a type attribute and existing btf_tag renamed to
btf_decl_tag ([2]).

This patch renamed BTF_KIND_TAG to BTF_KIND_DECL_TAG and some
other declarations with *_tag to *_decl_tag to make it clear
the tag is for declaration. In the future, BTF_KIND_TYPE_TAG
might be introduced per [3].
