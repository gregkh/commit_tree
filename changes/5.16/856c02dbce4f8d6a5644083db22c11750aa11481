bpf: Introduce helper bpf_get_branch_snapshot

Introduce bpf_get_branch_snapshot(), which allows tracing pogram to get
branch trace from hardware (e.g. Intel LBR). To use the feature, the
user need to create perf_event with proper branch_record filtering
on each cpu, and then calls bpf_get_branch_snapshot in the bpf function.
On Intel CPUs, VLBR event (raw event 0x1b00) can be use for this.
