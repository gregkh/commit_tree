drm/i915/gt: Initialize L3CC table in mocs init

Initialize the L3CC table as part of mocs initialization to program
LNCFCMOCSx registers so that the mocs settings are available for
selection for subsequent memory transactions in the driver load path.

We need to keep L3CC initialization in intel_mocs_init_engine() also
so that in execlists submission, these registers can be rewritten
during engine reset.
