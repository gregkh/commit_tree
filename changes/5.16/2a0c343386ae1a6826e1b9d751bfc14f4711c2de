KVM: arm64: Initialize trap registers for protected VMs

Protected VMs have more restricted features that need to be
trapped. Moreover, the host should not be trusted to set the
appropriate trapping registers and their values.

Initialize the trapping registers, i.e., hcr_el2, mdcr_el2, and
cptr_el2 at EL2 for protected guests, based on the values of the
guest's feature id registers.

No functional change intended as trap handlers introduced in the
previous patch are still not hooked in to the guest exit
handlers.
