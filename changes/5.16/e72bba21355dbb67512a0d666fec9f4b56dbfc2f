ice: split ice_ring onto Tx/Rx separate structs

While it was convenient to have a generic ring structure that served
both Tx and Rx sides, next commits are going to introduce several
Tx-specific fields, so in order to avoid hurting the Rx side, let's
pull out the Tx ring onto new ice_tx_ring and ice_rx_ring structs.

Rx ring could be handled by the old ice_ring which would reduce the code
churn within this patch, but this would make things asymmetric.

Make the union out of the ring container within ice_q_vector so that it
is possible to iterate over newly introduced ice_tx_ring.

Remove the @size as it's only accessed from control path and it can be
calculated pretty easily.

Change definitions of ice_update_ring_stats and
ice_fetch_u64_stats_per_ring so that they are ring agnostic and can be
used for both Rx and Tx rings.

Sizes of Rx and Tx ring structs are 256 and 192 bytes, respectively. In
Rx ring xdp_rxq_info occupies its own cacheline, so it's the major
difference now.
