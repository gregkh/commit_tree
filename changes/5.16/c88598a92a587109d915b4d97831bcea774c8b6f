io_uring: optimise read/write iov state storing

Currently io_read() and io_write() keep separate pointers to an iter and
to struct iov_iter_state, which is not great for register spilling and
requires more on-stack copies. They are both either on-stack or in
req->async_data at the same time, so use struct io_rw_state and keep a
pointer only to it, so having all the state with just one pointer.
