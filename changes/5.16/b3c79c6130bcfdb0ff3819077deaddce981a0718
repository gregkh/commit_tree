KVM: arm64: selftests: Introduce ARM64_SYS_KVM_REG

With the inclusion of sysreg.h, that brings in system register
encodings, it would be redundant to re-define register encodings
again in processor.h to use it with ARM64_SYS_REG for the KVM
functions such as set_reg() or get_reg(). Hence, add helper macro,
ARM64_SYS_KVM_REG, that converts SYS_* definitions in sysreg.h
into ARM64_SYS_REG definitions.

Also replace all the users of ARM64_SYS_REG, relying on
the encodings created in processor.h, with ARM64_SYS_KVM_REG and
remove the definitions.
