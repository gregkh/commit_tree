perf: Add mem_hops field in perf_mem_data_src structure

Going forward, future generation systems can have more hierarchy
within the node/package level but currently we don't have any data source
encoding field in perf, which can be used to represent this level of data.

Add a new field called 'mem_hops' in the perf_mem_data_src structure
which can be used to represent intra-node/package or inter-node/off-package
details. This field is of size 3 bits where PERF_MEM_HOPS_{NA, 0..6} value
can be used to present different hop levels data.

Also add corresponding macros to define mem_hop field values
and shift value.

Currently we define macro for HOPS_0 which corresponds
to data coming from another core but same node.

For ex: Encodings for mem_hops fields with L2 cache:

L2			- local L2
L2 | REMOTE | HOPS_0	- remote core, same node L2
