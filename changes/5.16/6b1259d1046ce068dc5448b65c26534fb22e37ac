iwlwifi: mvm: remove session protection after auth/assoc

When auth/assoc completes, we should remove session protection,
except when association is successful, where we need it until a
beacon is received from the AP.

In particular, in the case of assoc comeback, currently the session
protection event just times out, leading to confusing messages:

  wlan0: 42:00:00:00:00:00 rejected association temporarily; comeback duration 1000 TU (1024 ms)
  iwlwifi 0000:00:00.0: Not associated and the session protection is over already...
  wlan0: Connection to AP 42:00:00:00:00:00 lost
  wlan0: associate with 42:00:00:00:00:00 (try 2/3)

mac80211 never does anything on the "Connection ... lost" as it's
not even connected.

Removing the session protection when it's no longer needed removes
those confusing messages and lets the device do other things in the
allocated time.
