tun: fix bonding active backup with arp monitoring

As stated in the bonding doc, trans_start must be set manually for drivers
using NETIF_F_LLTX:
 Drivers that use NETIF_F_LLTX flag must also update
 netdev_queue->trans_start. If they do not, then the ARP monitor will
 immediately fail any slaves using that driver, and those slaves will stay
 down.
