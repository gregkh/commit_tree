soc: imx: gpcv2: Turn domain->pgc into bitfield

There is currently the MX8MM GPU domain, which is in fact a composite domain
for both GPU2D and GPU3D. To correctly configure this domain, it is necessary
to control both GPC_PGC_nCTRL(GPU_2D) and GPC_PGC_nCTRL(GPU_3D) at the same
time. This is currently not possible.

Turn the domain->pgc from value into bitfield and use for_each_set_bit() to
iterate over all bits set in domain->pgc when configuring GPC_PGC_nCTRL
register array. This way it is possible to configure all GPC_PGC_nCTRL
registers required in a particular domain.

This is a preparatory patch, no functional change.
