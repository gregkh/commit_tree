btrfs: rename setup_extent_mapping in relocation code

In btrfs code we have two functions called setup_extent_mapping, one in
the extent_map code and one in the relocation code. While both are
private to their respective implementation, this can still be confusing
for the reader.

So rename the version in relocation.c to setup_relocation_extent_mapping.
No functional changes.
