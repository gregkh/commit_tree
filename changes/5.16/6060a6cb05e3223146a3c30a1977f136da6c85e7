samples/bpf: Fix build error due to -isystem removal

Since recent Kbuild updates we no longer include files from compiler
directories. However, samples/bpf/hbm_kern.h hasn't been tuned for
this (LLVM 13):

  CLANG-bpf  samples/bpf/hbm_out_kern.o
In file included from samples/bpf/hbm_out_kern.c:55:
samples/bpf/hbm_kern.h:12:10: fatal error: 'stddef.h' file not found
         ^~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
  CLANG-bpf  samples/bpf/hbm_edt_kern.o
In file included from samples/bpf/hbm_edt_kern.c:53:
samples/bpf/hbm_kern.h:12:10: fatal error: 'stddef.h' file not found
         ^~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

It is enough to just drop both stdbool.h and stddef.h from includes
to fix those.
