remoteproc: qcom: q6v5: Use qmp_send to update co-processor load state

The power domains exposed by the AOSS QMP driver control the load state
resources linked to modem, adsp, cdsp remoteprocs. These are used to
notify the Always on Subsystem (AOSS) that a particular co-processor is
up/down. AOSS uses this information to wait for the co-processors to
suspend before starting its sleep sequence.

These co-processors enter low-power modes independent to that of the
application processor and the load state resources linked to them are
expected to remain unaltered across system suspend/resume cycles. To
achieve this behavior lets stop using the power-domains exposed by the
AOSS QMP node and replace them with generic qmp_send interface instead.
