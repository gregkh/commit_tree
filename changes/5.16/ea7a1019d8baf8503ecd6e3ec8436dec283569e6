SUNRPC: Partial revert of commit 6f9f17287e78

The premise of commit 6f9f17287e78 ("SUNRPC: Mitigate cond_resched() in
xprt_transmit()") was that cond_resched() is expensive and unnecessary
when there has been just a single send.
The point of cond_resched() is to ensure that tasks that should pre-empt
this one get a chance to do so when it is safe to do so. The code prior
to commit 6f9f17287e78 failed to take into account that it was keeping a
rpc_task pinned for longer than it needed to, and so rather than doing a
full revert, let's just move the cond_resched.
