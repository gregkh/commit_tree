btrfs: defrag: pass file_ra_state instead of file to btrfs_defrag_file()

Currently btrfs_defrag_file() accepts both "struct inode" and "struct
file" as parameter.  We can easily grab "struct inode" from "struct
file" using file_inode() helper.

The reason why we need "struct file" is just to re-use its f_ra.

Change this to pass "struct file_ra_state" parameter, so that it's more
clear what we really want.  Since we're here, also add some comments on
the function btrfs_defrag_file().
