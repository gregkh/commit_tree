xfs: use kmem_cache_free() for kmem_cache objects

For kmalloc() allocations SLOB prepends the blocks with a 4-byte header,
and it puts the size of the allocated blocks in that header.
Blocks allocated with kmem_cache_alloc() allocations do not have that
header.

SLOB explodes when you allocate memory with kmem_cache_alloc() and then
try to free it with kfree() instead of kmem_cache_free().
SLOB will assume that there is a header when there is none, read some
garbage to size variable and corrupt the adjacent objects, which
eventually leads to hang or panic.

Let's make XFS work with SLOB by using proper free function.
