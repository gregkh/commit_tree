smb3: do not error on fsync when readonly

Linux allows doing a flush/fsync on a file open for read-only,
but the protocol does not allow that.  If the file passed in
on the flush is read-only try to find a writeable handle for
the same inode, if that is not possible skip sending the
fsync call to the server to avoid breaking the apps.
