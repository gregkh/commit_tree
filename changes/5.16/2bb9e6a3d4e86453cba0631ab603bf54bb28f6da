mfd: ti_am335x_tscadc: Mimic the probe from resume()

Use the number of touchscreen wires (tsc_wires) instead of the flag
indicating a touchscreen cell (tsc_cell) to mimic the logic from the
probe.

Besides keeping a certain harmony in the driver, the main benefit is
that we are going to simplify the number of entries in the main MFD
structure and tsc_cell can now be removed more easily.
