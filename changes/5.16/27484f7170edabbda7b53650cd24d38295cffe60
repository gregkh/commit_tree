net/mlx5e: Offload tc rules that redirect to ovs internal port

Allow offloading rules that redirect to ovs internal port
ingress and egress.

To support redirect to ingress device, offloading of REDIRECT_INGRESS
action is added.

When a tc rule redirects to ovs internal port, the hw rule will
overwrite the input vport value in reg_c0 with a new vport metadata
value that is mapped for this internal port using the internal
port mapping api that is introduce in previous patches.
After that the hw rule will redirect the packet to the root table
to continue processing with the new vport metadata value.

The new vport metadata value indicates that this packet is now
arriving through an internal port and therefore should be processed
using rules that apply on the same internal port as the filter device.
Therefore, following rules that apply on this internal port will have
to match on the same vport metadata value as part of their matching
keys to make sure the packet belongs to the internal port.
