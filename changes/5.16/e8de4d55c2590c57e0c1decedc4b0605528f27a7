drm/edid: Use new encoded panel id style for quirks matching

In the patch ("drm/edid: Allow the querying/working with the panel ID
from the EDID") we introduced a different way of working with the
panel ID stored in the EDID. Let's use this new way for the quirks
code.

Advantages of the new style:
* Smaller data structure size. Saves 4 bytes per panel.
* Iterate through quirks structure with just "==" instead of strncmp()
* In-kernel storage is more similar to what's stored in the EDID
  itself making it easier to grok that they are referring to the same
  value.
