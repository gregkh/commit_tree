NFS: Further optimisations for 'ls -l'

If a user is doing 'ls -l', we have a heuristic in GETATTR that tells
the readdir code to try to use READDIRPLUS in order to refresh the inode
attributes. In certain cirumstances, we also try to invalidate the
remaining directory entries in order to ensure this refresh.

If there are multiple readers of the directory, we probably should avoid
invalidating the page cache, since the heuristic breaks down in that
situation anyway.
