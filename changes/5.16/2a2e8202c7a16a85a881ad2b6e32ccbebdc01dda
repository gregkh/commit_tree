parisc: move CPU field back into thread_info

In commit 2214c0e77259 ("parisc: Move thread_info into task struct")
PA-RISC gained support for THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK while changes were
already underway to keep the CPU field in thread_info rather than move
it into task_struct when THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is enabled. The result is a
broken build for all PA-RISC configs that enable SMP.

So let's partially revert that commit, and get rid of the ugly hack to
get at the offset of task_struct::cpu without having to include
linux/sched.h, and put the CPU field back where it was before.
