tools: arm64: Import sysreg.h

Bring-in the kernel's arch/arm64/include/asm/sysreg.h
into tools/ for arm64 to make use of all the standard
register definitions in consistence with the kernel.

Make use of the register read/write definitions from
sysreg.h, instead of the existing definitions. A syntax
correction is needed for the files that use write_sysreg()
to make it compliant with the new (kernel's) syntax.
