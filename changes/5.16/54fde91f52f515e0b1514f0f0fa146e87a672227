btrfs: update device path inode time instead of bd_inode

Christoph pointed out that I'm updating bdev->bd_inode for the device
time when we remove block devices from a btrfs file system, however this
isn't actually exposed to anything.  The inode we want to update is the
one that's associated with the path to the device, usually on devtmpfs,
so that blkid notices the difference.

We still don't want to do the blkdev_open, so use kern_path() to get the
path to the given device and do the update time on that inode.

Fixes: 8f96a5bfa150 ("btrfs: update the bdev time directly when closing")
