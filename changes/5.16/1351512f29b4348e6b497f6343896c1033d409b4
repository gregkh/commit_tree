arm64: dts: qcom: Correct QMP PHY child node name

Many child nodes of QMP PHY are named without following bindings schema
and causing dtbs_check warnings like below.

phy@1c06000: 'lane@1c06800' does not match any of the regexes: '^phy@[0-9a-f]+$'
        arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-asus-novago-tp370ql.dt.yaml
        arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-hp-envy-x2.dt.yaml
        arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-lenovo-miix-630.dt.yaml
        arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-mtp.dt.yaml
        arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-oneplus-cheeseburger.dt.yaml
        arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-oneplus-dumpling.dt.yaml

Correct them to fix the warnings.
