fuse: use kmap_local_page()

Due to the introduction of kmap_local_*, the storage of slots used for
short-term mapping has changed from per-CPU to per-thread.  kmap_atomic()
disable preemption, while kmap_local_*() only disable migration.

There is no need to disable preemption in several kamp_atomic places used
in fuse.
