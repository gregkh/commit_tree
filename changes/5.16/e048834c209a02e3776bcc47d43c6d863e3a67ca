drm/hyperv: Fix device removal on Gen1 VMs

The Hyper-V DRM driver tries to free MMIO region on removing
the device regardless of VM type, while Gen1 VMs don't use MMIO
and hence causing the kernel to crash on a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by making deallocating MMIO only on Gen2 machines and implement
removal for Gen1
