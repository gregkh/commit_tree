Input: zinitix - make sure the IRQ is allocated before it gets enabled

Since irq request is the last thing in the driver probe, it happens
later than the input device registration. This means that there is a
small time window where if the open method is called the driver will
attempt to enable not yet available irq.

Fix that by moving the irq request before the input device registration.
