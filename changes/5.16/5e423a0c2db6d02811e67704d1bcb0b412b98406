HID: cp2112: Use struct_group() for memcpy() region

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally writing across neighboring fields.

Use struct_group() in struct cp2112_string_report around members report,
length, type, and string, so they can be referenced together. This will
allow memcpy() and sizeof() to more easily reason about sizes, improve
readability, and avoid future warnings about writing beyond the end of
report.

"pahole" shows no size nor member offset changes to struct
cp2112_string_report.  "objdump -d" shows no meaningful object
code changes (i.e. only source line number induced differences.)
