tracing/perf: Add interrupt_context_level() helper

Now that there are three different instances of doing the addition trick
to the preempt_count() and NMI_MASK, HARDIRQ_MASK and SOFTIRQ_OFFSET
macros, it deserves a helper function defined in the preempt.h header.

Add the interrupt_context_level() helper and replace the three instances
that do that logic with it.
