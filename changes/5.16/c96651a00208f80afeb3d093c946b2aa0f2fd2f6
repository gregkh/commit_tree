media: staging/intel-ipu3: Constify static struct v4l2_subdev_internal_ops

The only usage of imgu_subdev_internal_ops is to assign its address to
the internal_ops field in the v4l2_subdev struct, which is a pointer to
const v4l2_subdev_internal_ops. Make it const to allow the compiler to
put it in read-only memory.
