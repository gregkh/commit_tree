can: m_can: Disable and ignore ELO interrupt

With the design of this driver, this condition is often triggered.
However, the counter that this interrupt indicates an overflow is never
read either, so overflowing is harmless.

On my system, when a CAN bus starts flapping up and down, this locks up
the whole system with lots of interrupts and printks.

Specifically, this interrupt indicates the CEL field of ECR has
overflowed. All reads of ECR mask out CEL.
