kprobes: Do not use local variable when creating debugfs file

debugfs_create_file() takes a pointer argument that can be used during
file operation callbacks (accessible via i_private in the inode
structure). An obvious requirement is for the pointer to refer to
valid memory when used.

When creating the debugfs file to dynamically enable / disable
kprobes, a pointer to local variable is passed to
debugfs_create_file(); which will go out of scope when the init
function returns. The reason this hasn't triggered random memory
corruption is because the pointer is not accessed during the debugfs
file callbacks.

Since the enabled state is managed by the kprobes_all_disabled global
variable, the local variable is not needed. Fix the incorrect (and
unnecessary) usage of local variable during debugfs_file_create() by
passing NULL instead.
