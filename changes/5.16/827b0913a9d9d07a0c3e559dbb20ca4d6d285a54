ASoC: DAPM: Cover regression by kctl change notification fix

The recent fix for DAPM to correct the kctl change notification by the
commit 5af82c81b2c4 ("ASoC: DAPM: Fix missing kctl change
notifications") caused other regressions since it changed the behavior
of snd_soc_dapm_set_pin() that is called from several API functions.
Formerly it returned always 0 for success, but now it returns 0 or 1.

This patch addresses it, restoring the old behavior of
snd_soc_dapm_set_pin() while keeping the fix in
snd_soc_dapm_put_pin_switch().
