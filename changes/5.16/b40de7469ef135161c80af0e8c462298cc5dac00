serial: tegra: Change lower tolerance baud rate limit for tegra20 and tegra30

The current implementation uses 0 as lower limit for the baud rate
tolerance for tegra20 and tegra30 chips which causes isses on UART
initialization as soon as baud rate clock is lower than required even
when within the standard UART tolerance of +/- 4%.

This fix aligns the implementation with the initial commit description
of +/- 4% tolerance for tegra chips other than tegra186 and
tegra194.
