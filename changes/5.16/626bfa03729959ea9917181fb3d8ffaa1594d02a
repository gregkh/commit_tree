MIPS: kernel: proc: add CPU option reporting

Many MIPS CPUs have optional CPU features which are not activated for
all CPU cores. Print the CPU options, which are implemented in the core,
in /proc/cpuinfo. This makes it possible to see which features are
supported and which are not supported. This should cover all standard
MIPS extensions. Before, it only printed information about the main MIPS
ASEs.
