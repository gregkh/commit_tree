ipmi: Add support for IPMB direct messages

An application has come up that has a device sitting right on the IPMB
that would like to communicate with the BMC on the IPMB using normal
IPMI commands.

Sending these commands and handling the responses is easy enough, no
modifications are needed to the IPMI infrastructure.  But if this is an
application that also needs to receive IPMB commands and respond, some
way is needed to handle these incoming commands and send the responses.

Currently, the IPMI message handler only sends commands to the interface
and only receives responses from interface.  This change extends the
interface to receive commands/responses and send commands/responses.
These are formatted differently in support of receiving/sending IPMB
messages directly.
