selftests: net: Correct case name

ipv6_addr_bind/ipv4_addr_bind are function names. Previously, bind test
would not be run by default due to the wrong case names

Fixes: 34d0302ab861 ("selftests: Add ipv6 address bind tests to fcnal-test")
Fixes: 75b2b2b3db4c ("selftests: Add ipv4 address bind tests to fcnal-test")
