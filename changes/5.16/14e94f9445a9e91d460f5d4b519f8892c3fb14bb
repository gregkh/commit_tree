octeontx2-af: verify CQ context updates

As per HW errata AQ modification to CQ could be discarded on heavy
traffic. This patch implements workaround for the same after each
CQ write by AQ check whether the requested fields (except those
which HW can update eg: avg_level) are properly updated or not.

If CQ context is not updated then perform AQ write again.
