clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Drop unnecessary ISB on CVAL programming

Switching from TVAL to CVAL has a small drawback: we need an ISB
before reading the counter. We cannot get rid of it, but we can
instead remove the one that comes just after writing to CVAL.

This reduces the number of ISBs from 3 to 2 when programming
the timer.
