csky: ftrace: Drop duplicate implementation of arch_check_ftrace_location()

The csky specific arch_check_ftrace_location() shadows a weak
implementation of the function in core code that offers the same
functionality but with additional error checking.

Drop the architecture specific function as a step towards further
cleanup in core code.
