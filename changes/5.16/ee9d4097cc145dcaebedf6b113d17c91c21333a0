iommu/dma: Skip extra sync during unmap w/swiotlb

Calling the iommu_dma_sync_*_for_cpu functions during unmap can cause
two copies out of the swiotlb buffer. Do the arch sync directly in
__iommu_dma_unmap_swiotlb instead to avoid this. This makes the call to
iommu_dma_sync_sg_for_cpu for untrusted devices in iommu_dma_unmap_sg no
longer necessary, so move that invocation later in the function.
