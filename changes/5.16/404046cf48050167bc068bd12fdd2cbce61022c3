drm/nouveau/mmu/gp100-: drop unneeded assignment in the if condition.

In order to keep the code style consistency of the whole file,
the 'inst' assignments should be deleted.

The clang_analyzer complains as follows:

drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/mmu/vmmgp100.c:499:8: warning:
Although the value storedto 'inst' is used in the enclosing expression,
the value is never actually read from 'inst'.

Karol: Removed unneeded brackets.
