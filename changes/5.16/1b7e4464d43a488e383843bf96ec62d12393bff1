mm/memcg: Add folio_memcg() and related functions

memcg information is only stored in the head page, so the memcg
subsystem needs to assure that all accesses are to the head page.
The first step is converting page_memcg() to folio_memcg().

The callers of page_memcg() and PageMemcgKmem() are not yet ready to be
converted to use folios, so retain them as wrappers around folio_memcg()
and folio_memcg_kmem().  They will be converted in a later patch set.
