RISC-V: KVM: FP lazy save/restore

This patch adds floating point (F and D extension) context save/restore
for guest VCPUs. The FP context is saved and restored lazily only when
kernel enter/exits the in-kernel run loop and not during the KVM world
switch. This way FP save/restore has minimal impact on KVM performance.
