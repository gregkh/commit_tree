mmc: sdhci-tegra: Fix switch to HS400ES mode

When CMD13 is sent after switching to HS400ES mode, the bus
is operating at either MMC_HIGH_26_MAX_DTR or MMC_HIGH_52_MAX_DTR.
To meet Tegra SDHCI requirement at HS400ES mode, force SDHCI
interface clock to MMC_HS200_MAX_DTR (200 MHz) so that host
controller CAR clock and the interface clock are rate matched.
