mm/smaps: simplify shmem handling of pte holes

Firstly, check_shmem_swap variable is actually not necessary, because
it's always set with pte_hole hook; checking each would work.

Meanwhile, the check within smaps_pte_entry is not easy to follow.
E.g., pte_none() check is not needed as "!pte_present && !is_swap_pte"
is the same.  Since at it, use the pte_hole() helper rather than dup the
page cache lookup.

Still keep the CONFIG_SHMEM part so the code can be optimized to nop for
!SHMEM.

There will be a very slight functional change in smaps_pte_entry(), that
for !SHMEM we'll return early for pte_none (before checking page==NULL),
but that's even nicer.
