blk-mq: only flush requests from the plug in blk_mq_submit_bio

Replace the call to blk_flush_plug_list in blk_mq_submit_bio with a
direct call to blk_mq_flush_plug_list.  This means we do not flush
plug callback from stackable devices, which doesn't really help with
the accumulated requests anyway, and it also means the cached requests
aren't freed here as they can still be used later on.
