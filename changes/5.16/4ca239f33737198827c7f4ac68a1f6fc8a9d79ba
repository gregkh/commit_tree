ASoC: cs42l42: Always enable TS_PLUG and TS_UNPLUG interrupts

The headset type detection must run to set the analogue switches
correctly for the attached headset type. Without this only headsets
with wiring matching the chip default will have a functioning mic.

commit c26a5289e865 ("ASoC: cs42l42: Add support for set_jack calls")
moved the interrupt unmasking to the component set_jack() callback.
But it's not mandatory for a machine driver to register a struct
snd_soc_jack handler. Without a registered handler the type detection
would not have run and so the mic would not work on some types of
headset.

This patch restores the unmasking of TS_PLUG and TS_UNPLUG interrupts
during probe.
