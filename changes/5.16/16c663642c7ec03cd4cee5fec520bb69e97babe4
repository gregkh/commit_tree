SUNRPC: Replace the "__be32 *p" parameter to .pc_decode

The passed-in value of the "__be32 *p" parameter is now unused in
every server-side XDR decoder, and can be removed.

Note also that there is a line in each decoder that sets up a local
pointer to a struct xdr_stream. Passing that pointer from the
dispatcher instead saves one line per decoder function.
