btrfs: use latest_dev in btrfs_show_devname

The test case btrfs/238 reports the warning below:

 WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 481 at fs/btrfs/super.c:2509 btrfs_show_devname+0x104/0x1e8 [btrfs]

Reason:
While btrfs_prepare_sprout() moves the fs_devices::devices into
fs_devices::seed_list, the btrfs_show_devname() searches for the devices
and found none, leading to the warning as in above.

Fix:
latest_dev is updated according to the changes to the device list.
That means we could use the latest_dev->name to show the device name in
/proc/self/mounts, the pointer will be always valid as it's assigned
before the device is deleted from the list in remove or replace.
The RCU protection is sufficient as the device structure is freed after
synchronization.
