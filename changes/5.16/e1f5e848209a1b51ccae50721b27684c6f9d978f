Input: iqs626a - prohibit inlining of channel parsing functions

Some automated builds report a stack frame size in excess of 2 kB for
iqs626_probe(); the culprit appears to be the call to iqs626_parse_prop().

To solve this problem, specify noinline_for_stack for all of the
iqs626_parse_*() helper functions which are called inside a for loop
within iqs626_parse_prop().

As a result, a build with '-Wframe-larger-than' as low as 512 is free of
any such warnings.
