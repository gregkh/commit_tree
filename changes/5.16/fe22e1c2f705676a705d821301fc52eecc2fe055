libata: support concurrent positioning ranges log

Add support to discover if an ATA device supports the Concurrent
Positioning Ranges data log (address 0x47), indicating that the device
is capable of seeking to multiple different locations in parallel using
multiple actuators serving different LBA ranges.

Also add support to translate the concurrent positioning ranges log
into its equivalent Concurrent Positioning Ranges VPD page B9h in
libata-scsi.c.

The format of the Concurrent Positioning Ranges Log is defined in ACS-5
r9.
