arm64: arm64_ftr_reg->name may not be a human-readable string

The id argument of ARM64_FTR_REG_OVERRIDE() is used for two purposes:
one as the system register encoding (used for the sys_id field of
__ftr_reg_entry), and the other as the register name (stringified
and used for the name field of arm64_ftr_reg), which is debug
information. The id argument is supposed to be a macro that
indicates an encoding of the register (eg. SYS_ID_AA64PFR0_EL1, etc).

ARM64_FTR_REG(), which also has the same id argument,
uses ARM64_FTR_REG_OVERRIDE() and passes the id to the macro.
Since the id argument is completely macro-expanded before it is
substituted into a macro body of ARM64_FTR_REG_OVERRIDE(),
the stringified id in the body of ARM64_FTR_REG_OVERRIDE is not
a human-readable register name, but a string of numeric bitwise
operations.

Fix this so that human-readable register names are available as
debug information.
