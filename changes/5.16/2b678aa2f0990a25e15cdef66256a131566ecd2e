vfio: Use a refcount_t instead of a kref in the vfio_group

The next patch adds a struct device to the struct vfio_group, and it is
confusing/bad practice to have two krefs in the same struct. This kref is
controlling the period when the vfio_group is registered in sysfs, and
visible in the internal lookup. Switch it to a refcount_t instead.

The refcount_dec_and_mutex_lock() is still required because we need
atomicity of the list searches and sysfs presence.
