blk-mq: Change rqs check in blk_mq_free_rqs()

The original code in commit 24d2f90309b23 ("blk-mq: split out tag
initialization, support shared tags") would check tags->rqs is non-NULL and
then dereference tags->rqs[].

Then in commit 2af8cbe30531 ("blk-mq: split tag ->rqs[] into two"), we
started to dereference tags->static_rqs[], but continued to check non-NULL
tags->rqs.

Check tags->static_rqs as non-NULL instead, which is more logical.
