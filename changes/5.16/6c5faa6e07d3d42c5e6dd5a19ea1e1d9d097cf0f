ARM: config: multi v7: Regenerate defconifg

These options have moved around when generating the defconfig. Update
them to reduce noise when generating future changes.

The exceptions are:

 - NEW_LEDS and LEDS_TRIGGERS which should drop out as they are selected
   by SND_CTL_LED. Instead we will improve the logic so SND_CTL_LED
   doesn't force-enable the subsystem.

 - The SPI_AX88796C network device. This was enabled in v5.11 for Exynos
   boards. The driver is not yet merged but there's work being done, so
   leave it alone for now.

 - PTP_1588_CLOCK is implied by enabled drivers STMMAC_ETH, IGB, E1000E
   and FEC, but this may be changed in the future as imply does not do
   what it was originally intended to do.
