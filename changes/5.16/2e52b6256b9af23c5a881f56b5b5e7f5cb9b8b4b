cxl/pmem: Add support for multiple nvdimm-bridge objects

In preparation for a mocked unit test environment for CXL objects, allow
for multiple unique nvdimm-bridge objects.

For now, just allow multiple bridges to be registered. Later, when there
are multiple present, further updates are needed to
cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() to identify which bridge is associated with
which CXL hierarchy for nvdimm registration.

Note that this does change the kernel device-name for the bridge object.
User space should not have any attachment to the device name at this
point as it is still early days in the CXL driver development.
