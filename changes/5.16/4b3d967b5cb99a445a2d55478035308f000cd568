selftests: forwarding: Add IPv6 GRE hierarchical tests

Add tests that check IPv6-in-IPv6, IPv4-in-IPv6 and MTU change of GRE
tunnel. The tests use hierarchical model - the tunnel is bound to a device
in a different VRF.

These tests can be run with TC_FLAG=skip_sw, so then they will verify
that packets go through hardware as part of enacp and decap phases.
