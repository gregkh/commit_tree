tracing: Test the 'Do not trace this pid' case in create event

When creating a new event (via a module, kprobe, eprobe, etc), the
descriptors that are created must add flags for pid filtering if an
instance has pid filtering enabled, as the flags are used at the time the
event is executed to know if pid filtering should be done or not.

The "Only trace this pid" case was added, but a cut and paste error made
that case checked twice, instead of checking the "Trace all but this pid"
case.
