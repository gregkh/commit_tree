wilc1000: add reset/terminate/repeat command support for SPI bus

Add reset/terminate/repeat command for SPI module. In case of SPI commands
failure, the host should issue a RESET command to WILC chip to recover
from any temporary bus error.
For now, the new command support is added and later the SPI read/write
API's would be modified to make use of these commands for retry mechanism
