thermal/drivers/thermal_mmio: Constify static struct thermal_mmio_ops

The only usage of thermal_mmio_ops is to pass its address to
devm_thermal_zone_of_sensor_register(), which has a pointer to const
struct thermal_zone_of_device_ops as argument. Make it const to allow
the compiler to put it in read-only memory.
