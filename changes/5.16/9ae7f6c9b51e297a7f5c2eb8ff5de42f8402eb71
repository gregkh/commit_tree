KVM: emulate: Comment on difference between RDPMC implementation and manual

SDM mentioned that, RDPMC:

  IF (((CR4.PCE = 1) or (CPL = 0) or (CR0.PE = 0)) and (ECX indicates a supported counter))
      THEN
          EAX := counter[31:0];
          EDX := ZeroExtend(counter[MSCB:32]);
      ELSE (* ECX is not valid or CR4.PCE is 0 and CPL is 1, 2, or 3 and CR0.PE is 1 *)
          #GP(0);
  FI;

Let's add a comment why CR0.PE isn't tested since it's impossible for CPL to be >0 if
CR0.PE=0.
