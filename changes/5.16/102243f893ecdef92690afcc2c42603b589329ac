staging: r8188eu: Remove conditionals CONFIG_88EU_{AP_MODE,P2P}

These rwo conditional compile symbols are explicitely defined.
As a result, their included code is always compiled. They could be
converted to Kconfig symbols; however, my experience with this driver
in a GitHub repo is that many users of the device have it built into
a SOC or SBC that they wish to use as an access point. As a result,
CONFIG_88EU_APMODE would need to be selected. Thuse it should be built in.

There have also been many users the wish to establish peer-to-peer
networks with this device. For this reason, I am also proposing that
CONFIG_88EU_P2P be automatically included.
