KVM: x86: only allocate gfn_track when necessary

Avoid allocating the gfn_track arrays if nothing needs them. If there
are no external to KVM users of the API (i.e. no GVT-g), then page
tracking is only needed for shadow page tables. This means that when tdp
is enabled and there are no external users, then the gfn_track arrays
can be lazily allocated when the shadow MMU is actually used. This avoid
allocations equal to .05% of guest memory when nested virtualization is
not used, if the kernel is compiled without GVT-g.
