octeontx2-af: Hardware configuration for inline IPsec

On OcteonTX2/CN10K SoC, the admin function (AF) is the only one
with all priviliges to configure HW and alloc resources, PFs and
it's VFs have to request AF via mailbox for all their needs.
This patch adds new mailbox messages for CPT PFs and VFs to configure
HW resources for inline-IPsec.
