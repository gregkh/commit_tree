net: mscc: ocelot: don't downgrade timestamping RX filters in SIOCSHWTSTAMP

The ocelot driver, when asked to timestamp all receiving packets, 1588
v1 or NTP, says "nah, here's 1588 v2 for you".

According to this discussion:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20211104133204.19757-8-martin.kaistra@linutronix.de/#24577647
drivers that downgrade from a wider request to a narrower response (or
even a response where the intersection with the request is empty) are
buggy, and should return -ERANGE instead. This patch fixes that.
