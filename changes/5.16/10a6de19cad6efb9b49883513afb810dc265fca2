seq_file: fix passing wrong private data

DEFINE_PROC_SHOW_ATTRIBUTE() is supposed to be used to define a series
of functions and variables to register proc file easily. And the users
can use proc_create_data() to pass their own private data and get it
via seq->private in the callback. Unfortunately, the proc file system
use PDE_DATA() to get private data instead of inode->i_private. So fix
it. Fortunately, there only one user of it which does not pass any
private data, so this bug does not break any in-tree codes.
