ucounts: In set_cred_ucounts assume new->ucounts is non-NULL

Any cred that is destined for use by commit_creds must have a non-NULL
cred->ucounts field.  Only curing credential construction is a NULL
cred->ucounts valid.  Only abort_creds, put_cred, and put_cred_rcu
needs to deal with a cred with a NULL ucount.  As set_cred_ucounts is
non of those case don't confuse people by handling something that can
not happen.
