ASoC: rt5682s: make rt5682s_aif2_dai_ops and rt5682s_soc_component_dev

This symbol is not used outside of rt5682s.c, so marks it static.

Fix the following sparse warning:

sound/soc/codecs/rt5682s.c:2848:39: warning: symbol
'rt5682s_soc_component_dev' was not declared. Should it be static?

sound/soc/codecs/rt5682s.c:2842:30: warning: symbol
'rt5682s_aif2_dai_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
