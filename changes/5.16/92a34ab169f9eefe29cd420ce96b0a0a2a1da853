net/ncsi: check for error return from call to nla_put_u32

As we can see from the comment of the nla_put() that it could return
-EMSGSIZE if the tailroom of the skb is insufficient.
Therefore, it should be better to check the return value of the
nla_put_u32 and return the error code if error accurs.
Also, there are many other functions have the same problem, and if this
patch is correct, I will commit a new version to fix all.
