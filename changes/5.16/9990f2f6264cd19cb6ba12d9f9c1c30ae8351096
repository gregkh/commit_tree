usb: typec: tipd: Enable event interrupts by default

TI PD controller comes with notification mechanism to inform
the host on activity in the PD controller. In the current
driver, the required masks are not set. This patch enables
the following events in the interrupt mask register:
PowerStatusUpdate - Set whenever contents of the power status reg changes
DataStatusUpdate - Set whenever contents of the data status reg changes
PlugInsertOrRemoval - Set whenever USB plug status has changed

With this change, the interrupt flooding issue is not seen anymore.
