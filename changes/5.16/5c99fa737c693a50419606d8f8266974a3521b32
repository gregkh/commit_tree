bus: ti-sysc: Handle otg force idle quirk

Let's add handling the otg force idle quirk for the old omap2430 glue layer
used up to omap4 as the musb driver quirk only works if the driver is
loaded. Unlike with the am335x glue layer, looks like we don't need the
quirk handling for SYSC_QUIRK_REINIT_ON_CTX_LOST.

Eventually when all the musb using SoCs are booting with device tree based
configuration, we can just remove the related quirk handling from the
musb driver.
