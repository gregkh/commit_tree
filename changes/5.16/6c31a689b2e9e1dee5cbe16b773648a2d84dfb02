ext4: commit inline data during fast commit

During the commit phase in fast commits if an inode with inline data
is being committed, also commit the inline data along with
inode. Since recovery code just blindly copies entire content found in
inode TLV, there is no change needed on the recovery path. Thus, this
change is backward compatiable.
