powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly

max_mapnr is used by virt_addr_valid() to check if a linear
address is valid.

It must only include lowmem PFNs, like other architectures.

Problem detected on a system with 1G mem (Only 768M are mapped), with
CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL and CONFIG_TEST_DEBUG_VIRTUAL, it didn't report
virt_to_phys(VMALLOC_START), VMALLOC_START being 0xf1000000.
