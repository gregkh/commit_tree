x86/fpu: Rework copy_xstate_to_uabi_buf()

Prepare for replacing the KVM copy xstate to user function by extending
copy_xstate_to_uabi_buf() with a pkru argument which allows the caller to
hand in the pkru value, which is required for KVM because the guest PKRU is
not accessible via current. Fixup all callsites accordingly.
