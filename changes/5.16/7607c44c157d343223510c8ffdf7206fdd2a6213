block: Hold invalidate_lock in BLKDISCARD ioctl

When BLKDISCARD ioctl and data read race, the data read leaves stale
page cache. To avoid the stale page cache, hold invalidate_lock of the
block device file mapping. The stale page cache is observed when
blktests test case block/009 is repeated hundreds of times.

This patch can be applied back to the stable kernel version v5.15.y
with slight patch edit. Rework is required for older stable kernels.
