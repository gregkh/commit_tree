arm64: dts: add device tree for the LX2160A on the NXP BlueBox3 board

The NXP BlueBox3 is a prototyping board for high-performance autonomous
driving systems. It contains two Linux systems, running on the
LX2160A and the other on the S32G2 SoC. This patch adds the device tree
support for the LX2160A SoC.

In terms of networking from the LX2160A's perspective, there are:

- 4 RJ45 10G ports using Aquantia copper PHYs which are attached
  directly to DPAA2 ports on the LX2160A

- 3 NXP SJA1110 automotive Ethernet switches. First two are managed by
  the LX2160A (each switch has a host port towards a dpmac), the third
  switch is managed by the S32G2. All 3 switches are interconnected
  through on-board SERDES lanes. The cascade ports between the 2
  switches managed by LX2160A form a DSA link, the cascade ports between
  the LX2160A and the S32G2 domain form user ports (the "to_sw3" net
  device).

- 2 RJ45 1G ports using Atheros copper PHYs which are attached directly
  to NXP SJA1110 switches

- 12 automotive 100base-T1 single-pair Ethernet ports routed from the
  SJA1110 internal PHY ports (TJA1103)

- One SGMII SERDES lane towards an internal connector, attached to one
  of the SJA1110 switch ports

On board rev A, the AR8035 RGMII PHY addresses were different than on
rev B and later. This patch introduces a separate device tree for rev A.
The main device tree is supposed to cover rev B and later.
