mm/memcg: Add folio_memcg_lock() and folio_memcg_unlock()

These are the folio equivalents of lock_page_memcg() and
unlock_page_memcg().

lock_page_memcg() and unlock_page_memcg() have too many callers to be
easily replaced in a single patch, so reimplement them as wrappers for
now to be cleaned up later when enough callers have been converted to
use folios.
