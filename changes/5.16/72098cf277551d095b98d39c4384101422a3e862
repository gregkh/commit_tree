staging: r8188eu: remove the helpers of usb_write32()

Remove the unnecessary _rtw_write32() and usb_write32() and embed their
code into the caller (i.e., rtw_write32()).

_rtw_write32() is a mere redefinition of rtw_write32() and it is unneeded.
usb_write32() was the only functions assigned to the (*_usb_write32)
pointer, so we can simply remove it and make a direct call.

This patch is in preparation for the _io_ops structure removal.
