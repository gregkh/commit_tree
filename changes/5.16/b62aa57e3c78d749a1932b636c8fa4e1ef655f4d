drm/i915/gt: Add support of mocs propagation

Now there are lots of Command and registers that require mocs index
programming.
So propagating mocs_index from mocs to gt so that it can be
used directly without having platform-specific checks.

V2:
Changed 'i915_mocs_index_gt' to anonymous structure.
