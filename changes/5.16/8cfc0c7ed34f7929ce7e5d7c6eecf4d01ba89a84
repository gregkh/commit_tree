ceph: properly handle statfs on multifs setups

ceph_statfs currently stuffs the cluster fsid into the f_fsid field.
This was fine when we only had a single filesystem per cluster, but now
that we have multiples we need to use something that will vary between
them.

Change ceph_statfs to xor each 32-bit chunk of the fsid (aka cluster id)
into the lower bits of the statfs->f_fsid. Change the lower bits to hold
the fscid (filesystem ID within the cluster).

That should give us a value that is guaranteed to be unique between
filesystems within a cluster, and should minimize the chance of
collisions between mounts of different clusters.
