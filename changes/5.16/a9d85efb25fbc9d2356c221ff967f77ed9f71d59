docs: use the lore redirector everywhere

Change all links from using the lkml redirector to the lore redirector,
as the kernel.org admin recently indicated: we shouldn't be using
lkml.kernel.org anymore because the domain can create confusion, as it
indicates it is only valid for messages sent to the LKML; the convention
has been to use https://lore.kernel.org/r/msgid for this reason.

In this process also change three links from using http to https.
