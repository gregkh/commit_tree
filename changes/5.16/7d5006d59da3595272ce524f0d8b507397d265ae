mxser: simplify condition in mxser_receive_chars_new

mxser_receive_chars_old() is used whenever MOXA_MUST_LSR_RERR is set in
status no matter the HW ID (the last 'if'). So there is no need for
another check of MOXA_MUST_LSR_RERR _with_ hwid == MOXA_MUST_MU860_HWID
(the third 'if').  Hence remove this subcase. That allows us to check
status on a single line with both UART_LSR_BRK_ERROR_BITS (from the
second 'if') and MOXA_MUST_LSR_RERR (the last 'if').
