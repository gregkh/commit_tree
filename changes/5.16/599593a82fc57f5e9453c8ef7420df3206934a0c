sched: make task_struct->plug always defined

If CONFIG_BLOCK isn't set, then it's an empty struct anyway. Just make
it generally available, so we don't break the compile:

kernel/sched/core.c: In function ‘sched_submit_work’:
kernel/sched/core.c:6346:35: error: ‘struct task_struct’ has no member named ‘plug’
 6346 |                 blk_flush_plug(tsk->plug, true);
      |                                   ^~
