thermal/drivers/tsens: Add timeout to get_temp_tsens_valid

The function can loop and lock the system if for whatever reason the bit
for the target sensor is NEVER valid. This is the case if a sensor is
disabled by the factory and the valid bit is never reported as actually
valid. Add a timeout check and exit if a timeout occurs. As this is
a very rare condition, handle the timeout only if the first read fails.
While at it also rework the function to improve readability and convert
to poll_timeout generic macro.
