media: cedrus: drop min_buffers_needed.

There is no reason for the cedrus driver to set min_buffers_needed.
A non-zero min_buffers_needed can cause problems with the Request API
if start_streaming fails when queueing a buffer from a request.

Since it is not needed for this driver, just remove it.
