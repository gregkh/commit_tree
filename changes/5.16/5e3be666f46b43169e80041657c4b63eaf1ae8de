PCI: Document /sys/bus/pci/devices/.../irq

Document /sys/bus/pci/devices/.../irq.

This file contains the IRQ of the INTx interrupt (or zero if the device
doesn't support INTx interrupts).

If the device has enabled MSI (not MSI-X), it contains the first MSI IRQ
instead.  This is a historical mistake because devices may support several
MSI or MSI-X vectors, and this file can't contain them all.  But we
preserve this behavior to avoid breaking userspace.
