KVM: MMU: inline set_spte in FNAME(sync_page)

Since the two callers of set_spte do different things with the results,
inlining it actually makes the code simpler to reason about.  For example,
FNAME(sync_page) already has a struct kvm_mmu_page *, but set_spte had to
fish it back out of sptep's private page data.
