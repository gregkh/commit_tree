fortify: Explicitly disable Clang support

Clang has never correctly compiled the FORTIFY_SOURCE defenses due to
a couple bugs:

	Eliding inlines with matching __builtin_* names
	https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50322

	Incorrect __builtin_constant_p() of some globals
	https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41459

In the process of making improvements to the FORTIFY_SOURCE defenses, the
first (silent) bug (coincidentally) becomes worked around, but exposes
the latter which breaks the build. As such, Clang must not be used with
CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE until at least latter bug is fixed (in Clang 13),
and the fortify routines have been rearranged.

Update the Kconfig to reflect the reality of the current situation.
