net/mlx5e: Fix ICOSQ recovery flow for XSK

There are two ICOSQs per channel: one is needed for RX, and the other
for async operations (XSK TX, kTLS offload). Currently, the recovery
flow for both is the same, and async ICOSQ is mistakenly treated like
the regular ICOSQ.

This patch prevents running the regular ICOSQ recovery on async ICOSQ.
The purpose of async ICOSQ is to handle XSK wakeup requests and post
kTLS offload RX parameters, it has nothing to do with RQ and XSKRQ UMRs,
so the regular recovery sequence is not applicable here.
