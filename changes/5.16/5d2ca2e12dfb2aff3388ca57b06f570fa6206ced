e100: fix device suspend/resume

As reported in [1], e100 was no longer working for suspend/resume
cycles. The previous commit mentioned in the fixes appears to have
broken things and this attempts to practice best known methods for
device power management and keep wake-up working while allowing
suspend/resume to work. To do this, I reorder a little bit of code
and fix the resume path to make sure the device is enabled.
