iavf: Fix refreshing iavf adapter stats on ethtool request

Currently iavf adapter statistics are refreshed only in a
watchdog task, triggered approximately every two seconds,
which causes some ethtool requests to return outdated values.

Add explicit statistics refresh when requested by ethtool -S.
