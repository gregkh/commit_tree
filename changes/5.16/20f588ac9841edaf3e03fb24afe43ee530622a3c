usb: ohci: disable start-of-frame interrupt in ohci_rh_suspend

While going into S3 or S4 suspend, an OHCI host controller can
generate interrupt requests if the INTR_SF enable flag is set.  The
interrupt handler routine isn't prepared for this and it doesn't turn
off the flag, causing an interrupt storm.

To fix this problem, make ohci_rh_suspend() always disable INTR_SF
interrupts after processing the done list and the ED unlinks but
before the controller goes into the suspended (non-UsbOperational)
state.  There's no reason to leave the flag enabled, since a
suspended controller doesn't generate Start-of-Frame packets.
