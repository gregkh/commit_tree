ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix quirk for TongFang PHxTxX1

This fixes the SND_PCI_QUIRK(...) of the TongFang PHxTxX1 barebone. This
fixes the issue of sound not working after s3 suspend.

When waking up from s3 suspend the Coef 0x10 is set to 0x0220 instead of
0x0020. Setting the value manually makes the sound work again. This patch
does this automatically.

While being on it, I also fixed the comment formatting of the quirk and
shortened variable and function names.
