arm64: kvm: use kvm_exception_table_entry

In subsequent patches we'll alter `struct exception_table_entry`, adding
fields that are not needed for KVM exception fixups.

In preparation for this, migrate KVM to its own `struct
kvm_exception_table_entry`, which is identical to the current format of
`struct exception_table_entry`. Comments are updated accordingly.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
