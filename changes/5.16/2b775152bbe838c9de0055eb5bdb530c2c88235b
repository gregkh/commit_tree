perf tests vmlinux-kallsyms: Ignore hidden symbols

Certain kernel symbols are purposely hidden from kallsyms. The function
is_ignored_symbol() from scripts/kallsyms.c decides if a symbol should
be hidden or not.

The perf test "vmlinux symtab matches kallsyms" fails in case perf finds
some of the hidden symbols in its machine image and can't match them to
kallsyms.

Let's add a filter to check if a symbol not found isn't one of these
before failing the test.

The function is_ignored_symbol() has been copied from scripts/kallsyms.c
and needs to be updated along with the original.
