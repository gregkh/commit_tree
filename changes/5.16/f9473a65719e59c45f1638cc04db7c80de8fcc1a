powerpc/pseries/cpuhp: remove obsolete comment from pseries_cpu_die

This comment likely refers to the obsolete DLPAR workflow where some
resource state transitions were driven more directly from user space

Isolate [...]" is at odds with the preceding sentences, and it does not
relate at all to the code that follows.

Remove it to prevent confusion.
