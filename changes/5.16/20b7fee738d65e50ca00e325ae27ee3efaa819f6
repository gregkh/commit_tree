mm/gup: further simplify __gup_device_huge()

Commit 6401c4eb57f9 ("mm: gup: fix potential pgmap refcnt leak in
__gup_device_huge()") simplified the return paths, but didn't go quite
far enough, as discussed in [1].

Remove the "ret" variable entirely, because there is enough information
already available to provide the return value.
