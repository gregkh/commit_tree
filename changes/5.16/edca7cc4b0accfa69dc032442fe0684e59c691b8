ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix quirk for Clevo NJ51CU

The Clevo NJ51CU comes either with the ALC293 or the ALC256 codec, but uses
the 0x8686 subproduct id in both cases. The ALC256 codec needs a different
quirk for the headset microphone working and and edditional quirk for sound
working after suspend and resume.

When waking up from s3 suspend the Coef 0x10 is set to 0x0220 instead of
0x0020 on  the ALC256 codec. Setting the value manually makes the sound
work again. This patch does this automatically.
