Bluetooth: Support the quality report events

This patch allows a user space process to enable/disable the quality
report events dynamically through the set experimental feature mgmt
interface.

Since the quality report feature needs to invoke the callback function
provided by the driver, i.e., hdev->set_quality_report, a valid
controller index is required.
