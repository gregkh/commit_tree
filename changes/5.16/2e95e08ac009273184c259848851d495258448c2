ravb: Add rx_max_buf_size to struct ravb_hw_info

R-Car AVB-DMAC has maximum 2K size on RX buffer, whereas on RZ/G2L
it is 8K. We need to allow for changing the MTU within the limit
of the maximum size of a descriptor.

Add a rx_max_buf_size variable to struct ravb_hw_info to handle
this difference.
