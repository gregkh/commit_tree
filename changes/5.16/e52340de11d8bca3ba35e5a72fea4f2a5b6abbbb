kernel.h: split out instruction pointer accessors

bottom_half.h needs _THIS_IP_ to be standalone, so split that and
_RET_IP_ out from kernel.h into the new instruction_pointer.h.  kernel.h
directly needs them, so include it there and replace the include of
kernel.h with this new file in bottom_half.h.
