mlxsw: spectrum_qdisc: Make RED, TBF offloads classful

Permit offloading qdiscs below RED and TBF. In order to avoid having to
implement trivial propagating callbacks for get_prio_bitmap and
get_tclass_num, extend mlxsw_sp_qdisc_get_prio_bitmap() and
..._get_tclass_num() to handle the lack of the callback as a cue to forward
the request to the parent.
