Bluetooth: Fix Advertisement Monitor Suspend/Resume

During system suspend, advertisement monitoring is disabled by setting
the HCI_VS_MSFT_LE_Set_Advertisement_Filter_Enable to False. This
disables the monitoring during suspend, however, if the controller is
monitoring a device, it sends HCI_VS_MSFT_LE_Monitor_Device_Event to
indicate that the monitoring has been stopped for that particular
device. This event may occur after suspend depending on the
low_threshold_timeout and peer device advertisement frequency, which
causes early wake up.

Right way to disable the monitoring for suspend is by removing all the
monitors before suspend and re-monitor after resume to ensure no events
are received during suspend. This patch fixes this suspend/resume issue.

Following tests are performed:
- Add monitors before suspend and make sure DeviceFound gets triggered
- Suspend the system and verify that all monitors are removed by kernel
  but not Released by bluetoothd
- Wake up and verify that all monitors are added again and DeviceFound
  gets triggered
