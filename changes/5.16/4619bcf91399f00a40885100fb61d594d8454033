ipv6: Check attribute length for RTA_GATEWAY in multipath route

Commit referenced in the Fixes tag used nla_memcpy for RTA_GATEWAY as
does the current nla_get_in6_addr. nla_memcpy protects against accessing
memory greater than what is in the attribute, but there is no check
requiring the attribute to have an IPv6 address. Add it.

Fixes: 51ebd3181572 ("ipv6: add support of equal cost multipath (ECMP)")
