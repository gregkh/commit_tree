btrfs: defrag: introduce helper to collect target file extents

Introduce a helper, defrag_collect_targets(), to collect all possible
targets to be defragged.

This function will not consider things like max_sectors_to_defrag, thus
caller should be responsible to ensure we don't exceed the limit.

This function will be the first stage of later defrag rework.
