coresight: trbe: Do not truncate buffer on IRQ

The TRBE driver marks the AUX buffer as TRUNCATED when we get an IRQ
on FILL event. This has rather unwanted side-effect of the event
being disabled when there may be more space in the ring buffer.

So, instead of TRUNCATE we need a different flag to indicate
that the trace may have lost a few bytes (i.e from the point of
generating the FILL event until the IRQ is consumed). Anyways, the
userspace must use the size from RECORD_AUX headers to restrict
the "trace" decoding.

Using PARTIAL flag causes the perf tool to generate the
following warning:

  Warning:
  AUX data had gaps in it XX times out of YY!

  Are you running a KVM guest in the background?

which is pointlessly scary for a user. The other remaining options
are :
  - COLLISION - Use by SPE to indicate samples collided
  - Add a new flag - Specifically for CoreSight, doesn't sound
    so good, if we can re-use something.

Given that we don't already use the "COLLISION" flag, the above
behavior can be notified using this flag for CoreSight.
