Bluetooth: call sock_hold earlier in sco_conn_del

In sco_conn_del, conn->sk is read while holding on to the
sco_conn.lock to avoid races with a socket that could be released
concurrently.

However, in between unlocking sco_conn.lock and calling sock_hold,
it's possible for the socket to be freed, which would cause a
use-after-free write when sock_hold is finally called.

To fix this, the reference count of the socket should be increased
while the sco_conn.lock is still held.
