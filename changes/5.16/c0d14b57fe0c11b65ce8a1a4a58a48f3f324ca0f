sched/fair: Provide update_sg_lb_stats() with sched domain statistics

Before deciding to pull tasks when using asymmetric packing of tasks,
on some architectures (e.g., x86) it is necessary to know not only the
state of dst_cpu but also of its SMT siblings. The decision to classify
a candidate busiest group as group_asym_packing is done in
update_sg_lb_stats(). Give this function access to the scheduling domain
statistics, which contains the statistics of the local group.
