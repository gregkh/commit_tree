iio: triggered-buffer: extend support to configure output buffers

Now that output (kfifo) buffers are supported, we need to extend the
{devm_}iio_triggered_buffer_setup_ext() parameter list to take a direction
parameter.

This allows us to attach an output triggered buffer to a DAC device.
Unfortunately it's a bit difficult to add another macro to avoid changing 5
drivers where {devm_}iio_triggered_buffer_setup_ext() is used.
Well, it's doable, but may not be worth the trouble vs just updating all
these 5 drivers.
