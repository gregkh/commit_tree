HID: playstation: expose DualSense player LEDs through LED class.

The DualSense player LEDs were so far not adjustable from user-space.
This patch exposes each LED individually through the LED class. Each
LED uses the new 'player' function resulting in a name like:
'inputX:white:player-1' for the first LED.
