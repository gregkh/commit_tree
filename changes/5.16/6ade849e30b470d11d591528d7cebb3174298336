ASoC: SOF: core: allow module parameter to override dma trace Kconfig

Most distributions do not enable the SOF developer options and
specifically the DMA trace. This is problematic for end-user/community
support since the sof-logger tool cannot extract valuable information.

Conversely in rare cases the DMA trace can lead to Heisenbugs by
creating more traffic to system memory and more interrupts.

This patch changes the logic so that the Kconfig value is used as a
default value for a module parameter, but this value can be changed as
needed. Users can override the distro DMA trace selection.
