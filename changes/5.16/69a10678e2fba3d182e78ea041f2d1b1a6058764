media: dvb-frontends: mn88443x: Handle errors of clk_prepare_enable()

mn88443x_cmn_power_on() did not handle possible errors of
clk_prepare_enable() and always finished successfully so that its caller
mn88443x_probe() did not care about failed preparing/enabling of clocks
as well.

Add missed error handling in both mn88443x_cmn_power_on() and
mn88443x_probe(). This required to change the return value of the former
from "void" to "int".
