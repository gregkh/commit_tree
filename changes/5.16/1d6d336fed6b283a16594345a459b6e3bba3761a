net: vmxnet3: remove multiple false checks in vmxnet3_ethtool.c

In one if branch, (ec->rx_coalesce_usecs != 0) is checked.  When it is
checked again in two more places, it is always false and has no effect
on the whole check expression.  We should remove it in both places.

In another if branch, (ec->use_adaptive_rx_coalesce != 0) is checked.
When it is checked again, it is always false.  We should remove the
entire branch with it.

In addition we might as well let C precedence dictate by getting rid of
two pairs of parentheses in the neighboring lines in order to keep
expressions on both sides of '||' in balance with checkpatch warning
silenced.
