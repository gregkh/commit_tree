drm/amd/display: Add DP 2.0 MST DC Support

[Why]
configure/call DC interface for DP2 mst support. This is needed to make DP2
mst work.

[How]
- add encoding type, logging, mst update/reduce payload functions

Use the link encoding to determine the DP type (1.4 or 2.0) and add a
flag to dc_stream_update to determine whether to increase/reduce
payloads.

v2:
* add DP_UNKNOWN_ENCODING handling
