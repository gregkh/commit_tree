arch_numa: simplify numa_distance allocation

Patch series "memblock: cleanup memblock_free interface", v2.

This is the fix for memblock freeing APIs mismatch [1].

The first patch is a cleanup of numa_distance allocation in arch_numa
I've spotted during the conversion.  The second patch is a fix for Xen
memory freeing on some of the error paths.

This patch (of 6):

Memory allocation of numa_distance uses memblock_phys_alloc_range()
without actual range limits, converts the returned physical address to
virtual and then only uses the virtual address for further
initialization.

Simplify this by replacing memblock_phys_alloc_range() with
memblock_alloc().
