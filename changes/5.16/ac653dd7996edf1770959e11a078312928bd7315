Revert "drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error status to children on unhold"

Propagating errors to dependent fences is broken and can lead to errors
from one client ending up in another. In commit 3761baae908a ("Revert
"drm/i915: Propagate errors on awaiting already signaled fences""), we
attempted to get rid of fence error propagation but missed the case
added in commit 8e9f84cf5cac ("drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error
status to children on unhold"). Revert that one too. This error was
found by an up-and-coming selftest which triggers a reset during
request cancellation and verifies that subsequent requests complete
successfully.
