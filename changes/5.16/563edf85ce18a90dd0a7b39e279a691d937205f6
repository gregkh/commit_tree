backlight: Propagate errors from get_brightness()

backlight.h documents "struct backlight_ops->get_brightness()" to return
a negative errno on failure.

So far these errors have not been handled in the backlight core.
This leads to negative values being exposed through sysfs although only
positive values are documented to be reported.
