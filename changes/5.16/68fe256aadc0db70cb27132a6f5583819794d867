io_uring: optimise io_req_init() sqe flags checks

IOSQE_IO_DRAIN is quite marginal and we don't care too much about
IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT. Save to ifs and hide both of them under
SQE_VALID_FLAGS check. Now we first check whether it uses a "safe"
subset, i.e. without DRAIN and BUFFER_SELECT, and only if it's not
true we test the rest of the flags.
