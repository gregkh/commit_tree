netfilter: nft_payload: support for inner header matching / mangling

Allow to match and mangle on inner headers / payload data after the
transport header. There is a new field in the pktinfo structure that
stores the inner header offset which is calculated only when requested.
Only TCP and UDP supported at this stage.
