scsi: smartpqi: Add TEST UNIT READY check for SANITIZE operation

Send a TEST UNIT READY to HBA disks and do not present them to the OS if
0x02/0x04/0x1b (SANITIZE IN PROGRESS) is returned.

During boot-up, some OSes appear to hang when there are one or more disks
undergoing a sanitize operation.

According to SCSI SBC4 specification section 4.11.2 "Commands allowed
during SANITIZE", some SCSI commands are permitted, but read/write
operations are not.

When the OS attempts to read the disk partition table a CHECK CONDITION ASC
0x04 ASCQ 0x1b is returned which causes the OS to retry the read until
SANITIZE has completed. This can take hours.

According to document HPE Smart Storage Administrator User Guide, during
the sanitize erase operation, the drive is unusable. I.e. the expected
behavior for SANITIZE is the that disk remains offline even after SANITIZE
has completed. The customer is expected to re-enable the disk using the
management utility.
