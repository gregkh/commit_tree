drm/mipi-dsi: Create devm device registration

Devices that take their data through the MIPI-DSI bus but are controlled
through a secondary bus like I2C have to register a secondary device on
the MIPI-DSI bus through the mipi_dsi_device_register_full() function.

At removal or when an error occurs, that device needs to be removed
through a call to mipi_dsi_device_unregister().

Let's create a device-managed variant of the registration function that
will automatically unregister the device at unbind.
