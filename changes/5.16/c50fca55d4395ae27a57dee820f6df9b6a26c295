block: simplify Kconfig files

Everything under block/ depends on BLOCK. BLOCK_HOLDER_DEPRECATED is
selected from drivers/md/Kconfig, which is entirely dependent on BLOCK.

Extend the 'if BLOCK' ... 'endif' so it covers the whole block/Kconfig.

Also, clean up the definition of BLOCK_COMPAT and BLK_MQ_PCI because
COMPAT and PCI are boolean.
