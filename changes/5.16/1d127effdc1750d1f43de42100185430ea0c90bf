selftests: add a test case for mirred egress to ingress

add a selftest that verifies the correct behavior of TC act_mirred egress
to ingress: in particular, it checks if the dst_entry is removed from skb
before redirect egress -> ingress. The correct behavior is: an ICMP 'echo
request' generated by ping will be received and generate a reply the same
way as the one generated by mausezahn.
