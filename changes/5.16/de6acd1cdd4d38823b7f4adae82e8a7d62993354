ice: fix adding different tunnels

Adding filters with the same values inside for VXLAN and Geneve causes HW
error, because it looks exactly the same. To choose between different
type of tunnels new recipe is needed. Add storing tunnel types in
creating recipes function and start checking it in finding function.

Change getting open tunnels function to return port on correct tunnel
type. This is needed to copy correct port to dummy packet.

Block user from adding enc_dst_port via tc flower, because VXLAN and
Geneve filters can be created only with destination port which was
previously opened.
