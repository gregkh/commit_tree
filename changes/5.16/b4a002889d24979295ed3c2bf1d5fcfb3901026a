selftests/damon: test debugfs file reads/writes with huge count

DAMON debugfs interface users were able to trigger warning by writing
some files with arbitrarily large 'count' parameter.  The issue is fixed
with commit db7a347b26fe ("mm/damon/dbgfs: use '__GFP_NOWARN' for
user-specified size buffer allocation").  This commit adds a test case
for the issue in DAMON selftests to avoid future regressions.
