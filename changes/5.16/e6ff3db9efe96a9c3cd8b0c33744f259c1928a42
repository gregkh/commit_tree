ASoC: SOF: ipc: Re-enable dumps after successful IPC tx

The dumps are silenced after an IPC tx timeout by default.
The IPC timeout can indicate severe error (firmware crash) or in some cases
it is less devastating and the firmware remains operational, the timeout
was due to a scheduling spike or other anomaly.

In any case consequent IPC timeouts will not print dumps but if any IPC do
succeed than we should re-enable the dumps to print dumps the next time
a timeout might happen.
