net: ieee802154: handle iftypes as u32

This patch fixes an issue that an u32 netlink value is handled as a
signed enum value which doesn't fit into the range of u32 netlink type.
If it's handled as -1 value some BIT() evaluation ends in a
shift-out-of-bounds issue. To solve the issue we set the to u32 max which
is s32 "-1" value to keep backwards compatibility and let the followed enum
values start counting at 0. This brings the compiler to never handle the
enum as signed and a check if the value is above NL802154_IFTYPE_MAX should
filter -1 out.
