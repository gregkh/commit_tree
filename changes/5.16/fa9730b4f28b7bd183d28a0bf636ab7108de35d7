ALSA: intel-dsp-config: add quirk for JSL devices based on ES8336 codec

These devices are based on an I2C/I2S device, we need to force the use
of the SOF driver otherwise the legacy HDaudio driver will be loaded -
only HDMI will be supported.

We previously added support for other Intel platforms but missed
JasperLake.
