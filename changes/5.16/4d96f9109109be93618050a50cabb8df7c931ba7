x86/sev: Replace occurrences of sev_active() with cc_platform_has()

Replace uses of sev_active() with the more generic cc_platform_has()
using CC_ATTR_GUEST_MEM_ENCRYPT. If future support is added for other
memory encryption technologies, the use of CC_ATTR_GUEST_MEM_ENCRYPT
can be updated, as required.
