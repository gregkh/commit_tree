libbpf: Properly ignore STT_SECTION symbols in legacy map definitions

The previous patch to ignore STT_SECTION symbols only added the ignore
condition in one of them. This fails if there's more than one map
definition in the 'maps' section, because the subsequent modulus check will
fail, resulting in error messages like:

libbpf: elf: unable to determine legacy map definition size in ./xdpdump_xdp.o

Fix this by also ignoring STT_SECTION in the first loop.
