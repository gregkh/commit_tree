xen/balloon: rename alloc/free_xenballooned_pages

alloc_xenballooned_pages() and free_xenballooned_pages() are used as
direct replacements of xen_alloc_unpopulated_pages() and
xen_free_unpopulated_pages() in case CONFIG_XEN_UNPOPULATED_ALLOC isn't
defined.

Guard both functions with !CONFIG_XEN_UNPOPULATED_ALLOC and rename them
to the xen_*() variants they are replacing. This allows to remove some
ifdeffery from the xen.h header file. Adapt the prototype of the
functions to match.
