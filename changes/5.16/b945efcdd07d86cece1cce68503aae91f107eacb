sched: Remove pointless preemption disable in sched_submit_work()

Neither wq_worker_sleeping() nor io_wq_worker_sleeping() require to be invoked
with preemption disabled:

  - The worker flag checks operations only need to be serialized against
    the worker thread itself.

  - The accounting and worker pool operations are serialized with locks.

which means that disabling preemption has neither a reason nor a
value. Remove it and update the stale comment.
