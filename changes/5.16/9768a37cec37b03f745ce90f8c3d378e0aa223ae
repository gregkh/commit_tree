serial: imx: disable console clocks on unregister

During console setup imx_uart_console_setup() enables clocks, but they
are never disabled when the console is unregistered, this leads to
clk_prepare_enable() being called multiple times without a matching
clk_disable_unprepare() in case of console unregister.

Ensure that clock enable/disable are balanced adding
clk_disable_unprepare() in the console exit callback.
