libbpf: Refactor and simplify legacy kprobe code

Refactor legacy kprobe handling code to follow the same logic as uprobe
legacy logic added in the next patchs:
  - add append_to_file() helper that makes it simpler to work with
    tracefs file-based interface for creating and deleting probes;
  - move out probe/event name generation outside of the code that
    adds/removes it, which simplifies bookkeeping significantly;
  - change the probe name format to start with "libbpf_" prefix and
    include offset within kernel function;
  - switch 'unsigned long' to 'size_t' for specifying kprobe offsets,
    which is consistent with how uprobes define that, simplifies
    printf()-ing internally, and also avoids unnecessary complications on
    architectures where sizeof(long) != sizeof(void *).

This patch also implicitly fixes the problem with invalid open() error
handling present in poke_kprobe_events(), which (the function) this
patch removes.
