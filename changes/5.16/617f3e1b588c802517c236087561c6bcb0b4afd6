ice: xsk: allocate separate memory for XDP SW ring

Currently, the zero-copy data path is reusing the memory region that was
initially allocated for an array of struct ice_rx_buf for its own
purposes. This is error prone as it is based on the ice_rx_buf struct
always being the same size or bigger than what the zero-copy path needs.
There can also be old values present in that array giving rise to errors
when the zero-copy path uses it.

Fix this by freeing the ice_rx_buf region and allocating a new array for
the zero-copy path that has the right length and is initialized to zero.
