iomap: Fix iomap_dio_rw return value for user copies

When a user copy fails in one of the helpers of iomap_dio_rw, fail with
-EFAULT instead of returning 0.  This matches what iomap_dio_bio_actor
returns when it gets an -EFAULT from bio_iov_iter_get_pages.  With these
changes, iomap_dio_actor now consistently fails with -EFAULT when a user
page cannot be faulted in.
