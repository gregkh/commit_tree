PCI: dwc: Clean up Kconfig dependencies (PCIE_DW_HOST)

The "depends on" Kconfig construct is a no-op in options that
are selected and therefore has no effect. Remove it.

Furthermore, there is no need to repeat menu dependencies (PCI).

Clean up the users of PCIE_DW_HOST and introduce idiom

	depends on PCI_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN
	select PCIE_DW_HOST

for all of them.
