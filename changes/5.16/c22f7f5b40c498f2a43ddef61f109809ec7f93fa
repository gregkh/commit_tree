staging: r8188eu: remove Efuse_PgPacketWrite_BT function

Remove static Efuse_PgPacketWrite_BT and its one caller from
core/rtw_efuse.c. This function is a wrapper function which calls
the Efuse_PgPacketWrite_BT function pointer of struct hal_ops
unconditionally. As this function pointer is never set, and this
function call is possible to reach, this could lead to an attempt to
deference a NULL pointer, which would crash the driver.
