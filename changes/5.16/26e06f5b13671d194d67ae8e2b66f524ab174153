block: update __register_blkdev() probe documentation

__register_blkdev() is used to register a probe callback, and
that callback is typically used to call add_disk(). Now that
we are able to capture errors for add_disk(), we need to fix
those probe calls where add_disk() fails and clean up resources.

We don't extend the probe call to return the error given:

1) we'd have to always special-case the case where the disk
   was already present, as otherwise concurrent requests to
   open an existing block device would fail, and this would be
   a userspace visible change
2) the error from ilookup() on blkdev_get_no_open() is sufficient
3) The only thing the probe call is used for is to support
   pre-devtmpfs, pre-udev semantics that want to create disks when
   their pre-created device node is accessed, and so we don't care
   for failures on probe there.

Expand documentation for the probe callback to ensure users cleanup
resources if add_disk() is used and to clarify this interface may be
removed in the future.
