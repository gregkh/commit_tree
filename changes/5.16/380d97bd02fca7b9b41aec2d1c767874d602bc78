KVM: s390: pv: properly handle page flags for protected guests

Introduce variants of the convert and destroy page functions that also
clear the PG_arch_1 bit used to mark them as secure pages.

The PG_arch_1 flag is always allowed to overindicate; using the new
functions introduced here allows to reduce the extent of overindication
and thus improve performance.

These new functions can only be called on pages for which a reference
is already being held.
