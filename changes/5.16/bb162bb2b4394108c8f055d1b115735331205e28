drm/sun4i: fix unmet dependency on RESET_CONTROLLER for PHY_SUN6I_MIPI_DPHY

When PHY_SUN6I_MIPI_DPHY is selected, and RESET_CONTROLLER
is not selected, Kbuild gives the following warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for PHY_SUN6I_MIPI_DPHY
  Depends on [n]: (ARCH_SUNXI [=n] || COMPILE_TEST [=y]) && HAS_IOMEM [=y] && COMMON_CLK [=y] && RESET_CONTROLLER [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - DRM_SUN6I_DSI [=y] && HAS_IOMEM [=y] && DRM_SUN4I [=y]

This is because DRM_SUN6I_DSI selects PHY_SUN6I_MIPI_DPHY
without selecting or depending on RESET_CONTROLLER, despite
PHY_SUN6I_MIPI_DPHY depending on RESET_CONTROLLER.

These unmet dependency bugs were detected by Kismet,
a static analysis tool for Kconfig. Please advise if this
is not the appropriate solution.
