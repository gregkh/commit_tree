fsnotify: Retrieve super block from the data field

Some file system events (i.e. FS_ERROR) might not be associated with an
inode or directory.  For these, we can retrieve the super block from the
data field.  But, since the super_block is available in the data field
on every event type, simplify the code to always retrieve it from there,
through a new helper.
