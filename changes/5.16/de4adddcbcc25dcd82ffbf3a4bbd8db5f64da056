of/irq: Add a quirk for controllers with their own definition of interrupt-map

Since commit 041284181226 ("of/irq: Allow matching of an interrupt-map
local to an interrupt controller"), a handful of interrupt controllers
have stopped working correctly. This is due to the DT exposing a
non-sensical interrupt-map property, and their drivers relying on the
kernel ignoring this property.

Since we cannot realistically fix this terrible behaviour, add a quirk
for the limited set of devices that have implemented this monster,
and document that this is a pretty bad practice.
