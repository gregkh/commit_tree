KVM: Make kvm_make_vcpus_request_mask() use pre-allocated cpu_kick_mask

kvm_make_vcpus_request_mask() already disables preemption so just like
kvm_make_all_cpus_request_except() it can be switched to using
pre-allocated per-cpu cpumasks. This allows for improvements for both
users of the function: in Hyper-V emulation code 'tlb_flush' can now be
dropped from 'struct kvm_vcpu_hv' and kvm_make_scan_ioapic_request_mask()
gets rid of dynamic allocation.

cpumask_available() checks in kvm_make_vcpu_request() and
kvm_kick_many_cpus() can now be dropped as they checks for an impossible
condition: kvm_init() makes sure per-cpu masks are allocated.
