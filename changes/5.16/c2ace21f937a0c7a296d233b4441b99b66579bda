cpufreq: tegra186/tegra194: Handle errors in BPMP response

The return value from tegra_bpmp_transfer indicates the success or
failure of the IPC transaction with BPMP. If the transaction
succeeded, we also need to check the actual command's result code.
Add code to do this.

While at it, explicitly handle missing CPU clusters, which can
occur on floorswept chips. This worked before as well, but
possibly only by accident.
