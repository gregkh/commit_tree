media: vidtv: move kfree(dvb) to vidtv_bridge_dev_release()

Adding kfree(dvb) to vidtv_bridge_remove() will remove the memory
too soon: if an application still has an open filehandle to the device
when the driver is unloaded, then when that filehandle is closed, a
use-after-free access takes place to the freed memory.

Move the kfree(dvb) to vidtv_bridge_dev_release() instead.
