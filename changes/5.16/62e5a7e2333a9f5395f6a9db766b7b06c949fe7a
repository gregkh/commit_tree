drm/amd/display: Fix surface optimization regression on Carrizo

[Why]
DCE legacy optimization path isn't well tested under new DC optimization
flow which can result in underflow occuring when initializing X11 on
Carrizo.

[How]
Retain the legacy optimization flow for DCE and keep the new one for DCN
to satisfy optimizations being correctly applied for ASIC that can
support it.
