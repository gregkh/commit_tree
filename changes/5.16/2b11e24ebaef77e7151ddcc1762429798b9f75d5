selftests: mlxsw: Test port shaper

TBF can be used as a root qdisc, in which case it is supposed to configure
port shaper. Add a test that verifies that this is so by installing a root
TBF with a ETS or PRIO below it, and then expecting individual bands to all
be shaped according to the root TBF configuration.
