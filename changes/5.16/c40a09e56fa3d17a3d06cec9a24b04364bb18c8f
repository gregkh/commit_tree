drm/amd/display: Add callbacks for DMUB HPD IRQ notifications

[Why]
We need HPD IRQ notifications (RX, short pulse) to properly handle
DP MST for DPIA connections.

[How]
A null pointer exception currently occurs when these are received
so add a check to validate that we have a handler installed for
the notification.

Extend the HPD handler to also handle HPD IRQ (RX) since the logic is
the same.
