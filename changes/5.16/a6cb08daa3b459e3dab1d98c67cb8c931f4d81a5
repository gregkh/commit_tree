net/mlx5: Let user configure event_eq_size param

Event EQ is an EQ which received the notification of almost all the
events generated by the NIC.
Currently, each event EQ is taking 512KB of memory. This size is not
needed in most use cases, and is critical with large scale. Hence,
allow user to configure the size of the event EQ.

For example to reduce event EQ size to 64, execute::
$ devlink resource set pci/0000:00:0b.0 path /event_eq_size/ size 64
$ devlink dev reload pci/0000:00:0b.0
