drm/nouveau: hdmigv100.c: fix corrupted HDMI Vendor InfoFrame

gv100_hdmi_ctrl() writes vendor_infoframe.subpack0_high to 0x6f0110, and
then overwrites it with 0. Just drop the overwrite with 0, that's clearly
a mistake.

Because of this issue the HDMI VIC is 0 instead of 1 in the HDMI Vendor
InfoFrame when transmitting 4kp30.
