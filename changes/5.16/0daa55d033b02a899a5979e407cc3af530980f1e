octeontx2-af: cn10k: debugfs for dumping LMTST map table

CN10k SoCs use atomic stores of up to 128 bytes to submit
packets/instructions into co-processor cores. The enqueueing is performed
using Large Memory Transaction Store (LMTST) operations. They allow for
lockless enqueue operations - i.e., two different CPU cores can submit
instructions to the same queue without needing to lock the queue or
synchronize their accesses.

This patch implements a new debugfs entry for dumping LMTST map
table present on CN10K, as this might be very useful to debug any issue
in case of shared LMTST region among multiple pci functions.
