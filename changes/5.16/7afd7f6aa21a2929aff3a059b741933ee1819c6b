iommu/vt-d: Check FL and SL capability sanity in scalable mode

An iommu domain could be allocated and mapped before it's attached to any
device. This requires that in scalable mode, when the domain is allocated,
the format (FL or SL) of the page table must be determined. In order to
achieve this, the platform should support consistent SL or FL capabilities
on all IOMMU's. This adds a check for this and aborts IOMMU probing if it
doesn't meet this requirement.
