KVM: cleanup allocation of rmaps and page tracking data

Unify the flags for rmaps and page tracking data, using a
single flag in struct kvm_arch and a single loop to go
over all the address spaces and memslots.  This avoids
code duplication between alloc_all_memslots_rmaps and
kvm_page_track_enable_mmu_write_tracking.
