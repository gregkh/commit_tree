usb: max-3421: Use driver data instead of maintaining a list of bound devices

Instead of maintaining a single-linked list of devices that must be
searched linearly in .remove() just use spi_set_drvdata() to remember the
link between the spi device and the driver struct. Then the global list
and the next member can be dropped.

This simplifies the driver, reduces the memory footprint and the time to
search the list. Also it makes obvious that there is always a corresponding
driver struct for a given device in .remove(), so the error path for
!max3421_hcd can be dropped, too.

As a side effect this fixes a data inconsistency when .probe() races with
itself for a second max3421 device in manipulating max3421_hcd_list. A
similar race is fixed in .remove(), too.
