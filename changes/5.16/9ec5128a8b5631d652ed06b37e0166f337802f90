scsi: ufs: ufshpb: Properly handle max-single-cmd

The spec recommends that for transfer length larger than the max-single-cmd
attribute (bMAX_DATA_SIZE_FOR_HPB_SINGLE_CMD) it is possible to couple
pre-requests with the HPB-READ command.  Being a recommendation, using
pre-requests can be perceived merely as a means of optimization.  A common
practice was to send pre-requests for chunks within some interval, and
leave the READ10 untouched if larger.

Now that the pre-request flows have been removed, all the commands are
single commands.  Properly handle this attribute and do not send HPB-READ
for transfer lengths larger than max-single-cmd.
