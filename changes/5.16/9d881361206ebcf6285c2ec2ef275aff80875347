bus: ti-sysc: Add quirk handling for reinit on context lost

Some interconnect target modules such as otg and gpmc on am335x need a
re-init after resume. As we also have PM runtime cases where the context
may be lost, let's handle these all with cpu_pm.

For the am335x resume path, we already have cpu_pm_resume() call
cpu_pm_cluster_exit().
