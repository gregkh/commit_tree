dma-mapping: remove bogus test for pfn_valid from dma_map_resource

dma_map_resource() uses pfn_valid() to ensure the range is not RAM.
However, pfn_valid() only checks for availability of the memory map for a
PFN but it does not ensure that the PFN is actually backed by RAM.

As dma_map_resource() is the only method in DMA mapping APIs that has this
check, simply drop the pfn_valid() test from dma_map_resource().
