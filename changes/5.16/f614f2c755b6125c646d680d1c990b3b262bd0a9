tools: Allow specifying base BTF file in resolve_btfids

This commit allows specifying the base BTF for resolving btf id
lists/sets during link time in the resolve_btfids tool. The base BTF is
set to NULL if no path is passed. This allows resolving BTF ids for
module kernel objects.

Also, drop the --no-fail option, as it is only used in case .BTF_ids
section is not present, instead make no-fail the default mode. The long
option name is same as that of pahole.
