mm: page_alloc: use migrate_disable() in drain_local_pages_wq()

drain_local_pages_wq() disables preemption to avoid CPU migration during
CPU hotplug and can't use cpus_read_lock().

Using migrate_disable() works here, too.  The scheduler won't take the
CPU offline until the task left the migrate-disable section.  The
problem with disabled preemption here is that drain_local_pages()
acquires locks which are turned into sleeping locks on PREEMPT_RT and
can't be acquired with disabled preemption.

Use migrate_disable() in drain_local_pages_wq().
