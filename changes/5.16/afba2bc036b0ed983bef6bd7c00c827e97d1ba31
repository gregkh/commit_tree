btrfs: zoned: implement active zone tracking

Add zone_is_active flag to btrfs_block_group. This flag indicates the
underlying zones are all active. Such zone active block groups are tracked
by fs_info->active_bg_list.

btrfs_dev_{set,clear}_active_zone() take responsibility for the underlying
device part. They set/clear the bitmap to indicate zone activeness and
count the number of zones we can activate left.

btrfs_zone_{activate,finish}() take responsibility for the logical part and
the list management. In addition, btrfs_zone_finish() wait for any writes
on it and send REQ_OP_ZONE_FINISH to the zone.
