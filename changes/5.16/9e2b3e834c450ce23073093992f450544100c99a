xen: fix wrong SPDX headers of Xen related headers

Commit b24413180f5600 ("License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license
identifier to files with no license") was meant to do a tree-wide
cleanup for files without any license information by adding a SPDX
GPL-2.0 line to them.

Unfortunately this was applied even to several Xen-related headers
which have been originally under the MIT license, but obviously have
been copied to the Linux tree from the Xen project without keeping the
license boiler plate as required.

Correct that by changing the license of those files back to "MIT".

Some files still contain the MIT license text. Replace that by the
related SPDX line.
