ice: Move devlink port to PF/VF struct

Keeping devlink port inside VSI data structure causes some issues.
Since VF VSI is released during reset that means that we have to
unregister devlink port and register it again every time reset is
triggered. With the new changes in devlink API it
might cause deadlock issues. After calling
devlink_port_register/devlink_port_unregister devlink API is going to
lock rtnl_mutex. It's an issue when VF reset is triggered in netlink
operation context (like setting VF MAC address or VLAN),
because rtnl_lock is already taken by netlink. Another call of
rtnl_lock from devlink API results in dead-lock.

By moving devlink port to PF/VF we avoid creating/destroying it
during reset. Since this patch, devlink ports are created during
ice_probe, destroyed during ice_remove for PF and created during
ice_repr_add, destroyed during ice_repr_rem for VF.
