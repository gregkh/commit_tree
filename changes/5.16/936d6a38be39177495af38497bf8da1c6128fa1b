fanotify: Report fid info for file related file system errors

Plumb the pieces to add a FID report to error records.  Since all error
event memory must be pre-allocated, we pre-allocate the maximum file
handle size possible, such that it should always fit.

For errors that don't expose a file handle, report it with an invalid
FID. Internally we use zero-length FILEID_ROOT file handle for passing
the information (which we report as zero-length FILEID_INVALID file
handle to userspace) so we update the handle reporting code to deal with
this case correctly.
