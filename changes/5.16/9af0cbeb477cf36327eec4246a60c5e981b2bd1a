clk: rockchip: drop module parts from rk3399 and rk3568 drivers

Both of these drivers were converted to real drivers and got a tristate
build option. But them being builtin_platform_drivers, they only ever
should be build-in - as the name suggests.

So adapt the Kconfig symbol and drop the MODULE_* parts from the drivers.
