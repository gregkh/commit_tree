locktorture: Warn on individual lock_torture_init() error conditions

When running locktorture as a module, any lock_torture_init() issues will be
reflected in the error code from modprobe or insmod, as the case may be.
However, these error codes are not available when running locktorture
built-in, for example, when using the kvm.sh script.  This commit
therefore adds WARN_ON_ONCE() to allow distinguishing lock_torture_init()
errors when running locktorture built-in.
