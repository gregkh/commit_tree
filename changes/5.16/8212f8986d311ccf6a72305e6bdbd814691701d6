kbuild: use more subdir- for visiting subdirectories while cleaning

Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst suggests to use "archclean" for
cleaning arch/$(SRCARCH)/boot/, but it is not a hard requirement.

Since commit d92cc4d51643 ("kbuild: require all architectures to have
arch/$(SRCARCH)/Kbuild"), we can use the "subdir- += boot" trick for
all architectures. This can take advantage of the parallel option (-j)
for "make clean".

I also cleaned up the comments in arch/$(SRCARCH)/Makefile. The "archdep"
target no longer exists.
