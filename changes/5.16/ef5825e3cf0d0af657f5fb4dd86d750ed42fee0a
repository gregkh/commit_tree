NFSD: move filehandle format declarations out of "uapi".

A small part of the declaration concerning filehandle format are
currently in the "uapi" include directory:
   include/uapi/linux/nfsd/nfsfh.h

There is a lot more to the filehandle format, including "enum fid_type"
and "enum nfsd_fsid" which are not exported via "uapi".

This small part of the filehandle definition is of minimal use outside
of the kernel, and I can find no evidence that an other code is using
it. Certainly nfs-utils and wireshark (The most likely candidates) do not
use these declarations.

So move it out of "uapi" by copying the content from
  include/uapi/linux/nfsd/nfsfh.h
into
  fs/nfsd/nfsfh.h

A few unnecessary "#include" directives are not copied, and neither is
the #define of fh_auth, which is annotated as being for userspace only.

The copyright claims in the uapi file are identical to those in the nfsd
file, so there is no need to copy those.

The "__u32" style integer types are only needed in "uapi".  In
kernel-only code we can use the more familiar "u32" style.
