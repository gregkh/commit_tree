net: phylink: don't call netif_carrier_off() with NULL netdev

Dan Carpenter points out that we have a code path that permits a NULL
netdev pointer to be passed to netif_carrier_off(), which will cause
a kernel oops. In any case, we need to set pl->old_link_state to false
to have the desired effect when there is no netdev present.
