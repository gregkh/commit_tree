USB: serial: cp210x: use usb_control_msg_recv() and usb_control_msg_send()

The new wrapper functions for usb_control_msg() can accept data from
stack and treat short reads as errors. Hence use the wrappers functions.
Please note that because of this change, cp210x_read_reg_block() will no
longer log the length of short reads.
