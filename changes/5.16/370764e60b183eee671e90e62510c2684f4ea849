ice: Fix clang -Wimplicit-fallthrough in ice_pull_qvec_from_rc()

Clang warns:

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/ice/ice_lib.c:1906:2: error: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Werror,-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
        default:
        ^
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/ice/ice_lib.c:1906:2: note: insert 'break;' to avoid fall-through
        default:
        ^
        break;
1 error generated.

Clang is a little more pedantic than GCC, which does not warn when
falling through to a case that is just break or return. Clang's version
is more in line with the kernel's own stance in deprecated.rst, which
states that all switch/case blocks must end in either break,
fallthrough, continue, goto, or return. Add the missing break to silence
the warning.
