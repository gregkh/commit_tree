arm64: dts: rockchip: add SPDIF node for ROCK Pi 4

Add a SPDIF audio-graph-card to ROCK Pi 4 device tree.

It's not enabled by default since all dma channels are used by
the (already) enabled i2s0/1/2 and the pin is muxed with GPIO4_C5
which might be in use already.
If enabled SPDIF_TX will be available at pin #15.
