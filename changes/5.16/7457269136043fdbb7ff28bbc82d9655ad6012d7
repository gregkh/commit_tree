habanalabs: create static map of f/w hwmon enums

Instead of using the Linux kernel HWMON enums definition when
communicating with the firmware, use proprietary HWMON based enums
i.e. map hwmon.h header enum to cpucp_if.h based enum while.

This is needed because the HWMON enums are not forcing backward
compatibility and therefore changes can break compatibility between
newer driver and older firmware.

The driver will check for CPU_BOOT_DEV_STS0_MAP_HWMON_EN bit to
validate if f/w supports cpucp->hwmon enum mapping to support older
firmware where this mapping won't be available.
