arm64: zynqmp: Add support for zcu102-rev1.1 board

zcu102 rev1.1 compare to rev1.0 is using by default different DDR memory
which requires different configuration. The reason for adding this file to
Linux kernel is that U-Boot fdtfile variable is composed based on board
revision (in eeprom) and dtb file should exist in standard distibutions for
passing it to Linux kernel.
