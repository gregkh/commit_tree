mips, bpf: Enable eBPF JITs

This patch enables the new eBPF JITs for 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS. It also
disables the old cBPF JIT to so cBPF programs are converted to use the
new JIT.

Workarounds for R4000 CPU errata are not implemented by the JIT, so the
JIT is disabled if any of those workarounds are configured.
