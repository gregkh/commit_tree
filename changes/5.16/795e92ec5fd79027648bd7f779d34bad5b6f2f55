of: Add of_get_cpu_hwid() to read hardware ID from CPU nodes

There are various open coded implementions parsing the CPU node 'reg'
property which contains the CPU's hardware ID. Introduce a new function,
of_get_cpu_hwid(), to read the hardware ID.

All the callers should be DT only code, so no need for an empty
function.
