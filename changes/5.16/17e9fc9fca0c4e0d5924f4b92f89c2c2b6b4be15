ceph: clean-up metrics data structures to reduce code duplication

This patch modifies struct ceph_client_metric so that each metric block
(read, write and metadata) becomes an element in a array.  This allows to
also re-write the helper functions that handle these blocks, making them
simpler and, above all, reduce the amount of copy&paste every time a new
metric is added.

Thus, for each of these metrics there will be a new struct ceph_metric
entry that'll will contain all the sizes and latencies fields (and a lock).
Note however that the metadata metric doesn't really use the size_fields,
and thus this metric won't be shown in the debugfs '../metrics/size' file.
