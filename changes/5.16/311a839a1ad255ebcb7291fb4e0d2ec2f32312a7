media: v4l2-ctrls: Document V4L2_CID_NOTIFY_GAINS control

Add documentation for the V4L2_CID_NOTIFY_GAINS control.

This control is required by sensors that need to know what colour
gains will be applied to pixels by downstream processing (such as by
an ISP), though the sensor does not apply these gains itself.
