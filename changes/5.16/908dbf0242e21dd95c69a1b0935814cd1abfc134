hwmon: (occ) Remove sequence numbering and checksum calculation

Checksumming of the request and sequence numbering is now done in the
OCC interface driver in order to keep unique sequence numbers. So
remove those in the hwmon driver. Also, add the command length to the
send_cmd function pointer, since the checksum must be placed in the
last two bytes of the command. The submit interface must receive the
exact size of the command - previously it could be rounded to the
nearest 8 bytes with no consequence.
