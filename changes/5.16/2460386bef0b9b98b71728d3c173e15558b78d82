net: mvmdio: fix compilation warning

The kernel test robot reported a following issue:

>> drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvmdio.c:426:36: warning:
unused variable 'orion_mdio_acpi_match' [-Wunused-const-variable]
   static const struct acpi_device_id orion_mdio_acpi_match[] = {
                                      ^
   1 warning generated.

Fix that by surrounding the variable by appropriate ifdef.
