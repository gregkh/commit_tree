fsnotify: pass dentry instead of inode data

Define a new data type to pass for event - FSNOTIFY_EVENT_DENTRY.
Use it to pass the dentry instead of it's ->d_inode where available.

This is needed in preparation to the refactor to retrieve the super
block from the data field.  In some cases (i.e. mkdir in kernfs), the
data inode comes from a negative dentry, such that no super block
information would be available. By receiving the dentry itself, instead
of the inode, fsnotify can derive the super block even on these cases.
