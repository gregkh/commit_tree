media: Add ADV7610 support for adv7604 driver.

ADV7610 is another HDMI receiver chip, very similar to
the ADV7611.

Also: print chip names in upper case.
Fix an error message claiming that no ADV761x has been found,
while in reality a chip different than requested (though still
supported) may have been found.
Tested on TinyRex BaseBoard Lite.
