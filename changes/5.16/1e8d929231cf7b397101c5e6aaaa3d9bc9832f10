clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Extend write side of timer register accessors to u64

The various accessors for the timer sysreg and MMIO registers are
currently hardwired to 32bit. However, we are about to introduce
the use of the CVAL registers, which require a 64bit access.

Upgrade the write side of the accessors to take a 64bit value
(the read side is left untouched as we don't plan to ever read
back any of these registers).

No functional change expected.
