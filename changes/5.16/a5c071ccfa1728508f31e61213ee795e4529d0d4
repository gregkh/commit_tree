rcu-tasks: Remove second argument of rcu_read_unlock_trace_special()

The second argument of rcu_read_unlock_trace_special() is always zero.
When called from exit_tasks_rcu_finish_trace(), it is the constant
zero, and rcu_read_unlock_trace_special() doesn't get called from
rcu_read_unlock_trace() unless the value of local variable "nesting"
is zero because in that case the early return is taken instead.

This commit therefore removes the "nesting" argument from the
rcu_read_unlock_trace_special() function, substituting the constant
zero within that function.  This commit also adds a WARN_ON_ONCE()
to rcu_read_lock_trace_held() in case non-zeroness some day appears.
