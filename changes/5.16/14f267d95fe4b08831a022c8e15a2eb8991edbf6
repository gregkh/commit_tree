bpf: btf: Introduce helpers for dynamic BTF set registration

This adds helpers for registering btf_id_set from modules and the
bpf_check_mod_kfunc_call callback that can be used to look them up.

With in kernel sets, the way this is supposed to work is, in kernel
callback looks up within the in-kernel kfunc whitelist, and then defers
to the dynamic BTF set lookup if it doesn't find the BTF id. If there is
no in-kernel BTF id set, this callback can be used directly.

Also fix includes for btf.h and bpfptr.h so that they can included in
isolation. This is in preparation for their usage in tcp_bbr, tcp_cubic
and tcp_dctcp modules in the next patch.
