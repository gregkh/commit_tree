selftests/bpf: Add test cases for struct_ops prog

Running a BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS prog for dummy_st_ops::test_N()
through bpf_prog_test_run(). Four test cases are added:
(1) attach dummy_st_ops should fail
(2) function return value of bpf_dummy_ops::test_1() is expected
(3) pointer argument of bpf_dummy_ops::test_1() works as expected
(4) multiple arguments passed to bpf_dummy_ops::test_2() are correct
