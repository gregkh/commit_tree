KVM: x86: Don't update vcpu->arch.pv_eoi.msr_val when a bogus value was written to MSR_KVM_PV_EOI_EN

When kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init() call from kvm_lapic_set_pv_eoi() fails,
MSR write to MSR_KVM_PV_EOI_EN results in #GP so it is reasonable to
expect that the value we keep internally in KVM wasn't updated.
