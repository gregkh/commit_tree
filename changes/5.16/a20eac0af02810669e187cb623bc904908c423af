selftests/bpf: Fix also no-alu32 strobemeta selftest

Previous fix aded bpf_clamp_umax() helper use to re-validate boundaries.
While that works correctly, it introduces more branches, which blows up
past 1 million instructions in no-alu32 variant of strobemeta selftests.

Switching len variable from u32 to u64 also fixes the issue and reduces
the number of validated instructions, so use that instead. Fix this
patch and bpf_clamp_umax() removed, both alu32 and no-alu32 selftests
pass.
