ASoC: qdsp6: audioreach: Fix clang -Wimplicit-fallthrough

Clang warns:

sound/soc/qcom/qdsp6/topology.c:465:3: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
                default:
                ^
sound/soc/qcom/qdsp6/topology.c:465:3: note: insert 'break;' to avoid fall-through
                default:
                ^
                break;
1 warning generated.

Clang is a little more pedantic than GCC, which permits implicit
fallthroughs to cases that contain just break or return. Clang's version
is more in line with the kernel's own stance in deprecated.rst, which
states that all switch/case blocks must end in either break,
fallthrough, continue, goto, or return. Add the missing break to fix
the warning.
