btrfs: zoned: allow preallocation for relocation inodes

Now that we use a dedicated block group and regular writes for data
relocation, we can preallocate the space needed for a relocated inode,
just like we do in regular mode.

Essentially this reverts commit 32430c614844 ("btrfs: zoned: enable
relocation on a zoned filesystem") as it is not needed anymore.
