ARM: socfpga: Fix crash with CONFIG_FORTIRY_SOURCE

When CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE is set, memcpy() checks the potential
buffer overflow and panics.  The code in sofcpga bootstrapping
contains the memcpy() calls are mistakenly translated as the shorter
size, hence it triggers a panic as if it were overflowing.

This patch changes the secondary_trampoline and *_end definitions
to arrays for avoiding the false-positive crash above.
