bpf/tests: Add test of ALU shifts with operand register aliasing

This patch adds a tests of ALU32 and ALU64 LSH/RSH/ARSH operations for the
case when the two operands are the same register. Mainly intended to test
JITs that implement ALU64 shifts with 32-bit CPU instructions.

Also renamed related helper functions for consistency with the new tests.
