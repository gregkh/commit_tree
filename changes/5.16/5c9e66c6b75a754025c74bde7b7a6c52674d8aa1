arm64: dts: rockchip: fix resets in tsadc node for rk356x

In the rockchip_thermal.c driver we now get the resets with
a devm_reset_control_array_get() function, so remove
the reset-names property as it is no longer needed.
Although no longer required in rockchip-thermal.yaml
sort tsadc-apb as first item.
