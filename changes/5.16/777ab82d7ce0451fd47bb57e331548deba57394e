KVM: X86: Raise #GP when clearing CR0_PG in 64 bit mode

In the SDM:
If the logical processor is in 64-bit mode or if CR4.PCIDE = 1, an
attempt to clear CR0.PG causes a general-protection exception (#GP).
Software should transition to compatibility mode and clear CR4.PCIDE
before attempting to disable paging.
