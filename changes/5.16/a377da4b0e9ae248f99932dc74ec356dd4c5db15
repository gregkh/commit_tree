drm/msm/dsi: Use division result from div_u64_rem in 7nm and 14nm PLL

div_u64_rem provides the result of the division and additionally the
remainder; don't use this function to solely calculate the remainder
while calculating the division again with div_u64.

A similar improvement was applied earlier to the 10nm pll in
5c191fef4ce2 ("drm/msm/dsi_pll_10nm: Fix dividing the same numbers
twice").
