task_stack: Fix end_of_stack() for architectures with upwards-growing stack

The function end_of_stack() returns a pointer to the last entry of a
stack. For architectures like parisc where the stack grows upwards
return the pointer to the highest address in the stack.

Without this change I faced a crash on parisc, because the stackleak
functionality wrote STACKLEAK_POISON to the lowest address and thus
overwrote the first 4 bytes of the task_struct which included the
TIF_FLAGS.
