staging: rtl8723bs: fix unmet dependency on CRYPTO for CRYPTO_LIB_ARC4

When RTL8723BS is selected, and CRYPTO is not selected,
Kbuild gives the following warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for CRYPTO_LIB_ARC4
  Depends on [n]: CRYPTO [=n]
  Selected by [m]:
  - RTL8723BS [=m] && STAGING [=y] && WLAN [=y] && MMC [=y] && CFG80211 [=y] && m && MODULES [=y]
  - RTLLIB_CRYPTO_WEP [=m] && STAGING [=y] && RTLLIB [=m]

This is because RTL8723BS selects CRYPTO_LIB_ARC4
without selecting CRYPTO, despite CRYPTO_LIB_ARC4
depending on CRYPTO.

This unmet dependency bug was detected by Kismet,
a static analysis tool for Kconfig. Please advise
if this is not the appropriate solution.
