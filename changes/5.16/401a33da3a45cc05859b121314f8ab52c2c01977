selftests/bpf: Make netcnt selftests serial to avoid spurious failures

When running `./test_progs -j` test_netcnt fails with a very high
probability, undercounting number of packets received (9999 vs expected
10000). It seems to be conflicting with other cgroup/skb selftests. So
make it serial for now to make parallel mode more robust.
