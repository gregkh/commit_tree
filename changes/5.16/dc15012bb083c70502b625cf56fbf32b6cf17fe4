s390/qeth: don't keep track of Input Queue count

The only actual user of qdio.no_input_queues is qeth_qdio_establish(),
and there we already have full awareness of the current Input Queue
configuration (1 RX queue, plus potentially 1 TX Completion queue).

So avoid this state tracking, and the ambiguity it brings with it.
