io_uring: return iovec from __io_import_iovec

We pass iovec** into __io_import_iovec(), which should keep it,
initialise and modify accordingly. It's expensive, return it directly
from __io_import_iovec encoding errors with ERR_PTR if needed.

io_import_iovec keeps the old interface, but it's inline and so
everything is optimised nicely.
