selftests/bpf: Switch SEC("classifier*") usage to a strict SEC("tc")

Convert all SEC("classifier*") uses to a new and strict SEC("tc")
section name. In reference_tracking selftests switch from ambiguous
searching by program title (section name) to non-ambiguous searching by
name in some selftests, getting closer to completely removing
bpf_object__find_program_by_title().
