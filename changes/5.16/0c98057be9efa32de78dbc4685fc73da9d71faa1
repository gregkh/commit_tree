nbd: Fix use-after-free in pid_show

I got issue as follows:

Reproduce this issue as follows:
1. nbd-server 8000 /tmp/disk
2. nbd-client localhost 8000 /dev/nbd1
3. cat /sys/block/nbd1/pid
Then trigger use-after-free in pid_show.

Reason is after do step '2', nbd-client progress is already exit. So
it's task_struct already freed.
To solve this issue, revert part of 6521d39a64b3's modify and remove
useless 'recv_task' member of nbd_device.
