hwmon: (tmp421) support specifying n-factor via DT

Previous patches added a way to specify some channel specific parameters
in DT and n-factor is definitely one of them. This calibration mechanism
is board specific as its value depends on the diodes/transistors being
connected to the sensor and thus the DT seems like a right fit for that
information. It is very similar to the value of shunt resistor that some
drivers allows specifying in DT.

This patch adds a possibility to set n-factor for each channel via
"n-factor" DT property in each channel subnode.
