ASoC: dt-bindings: cs42l42: Correct description of ts-inv

This swaps the descriptions of the 0 and 1 values to match
what the driver actually does with this property.

The background here is somewhat confusing. The codec has two
invert bits for the tip sense. The DT property should have been
for the TIP_SENSE_INV bit, which is the one that controls the
detect block. Due to some misunderstanding of the hardware the
driver actually implemented setting of the TS_INV bit, which is
only for swapping the sense of the interrupt bits. The description
was taken from the datasheet and refers to TIP_SENSE_INV but
unfortunately TS_INV has a different purpose and the net effect
of changing it is the reverse of what was intended (this is not
clearly described in the datasheet). So the ts-inv settings have
always done the exact opposite of what the description said.

Given the age of the driver, it's too late now to swap the meanings
of the values, so the description is changed to match the behaviour.
They have been annotated with the terminology used in the datasheet
to avoid the confusion of which one corresponds to what the datasheet
calls "inverted tip sense".
