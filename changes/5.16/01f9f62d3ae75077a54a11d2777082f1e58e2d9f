x86/fpu: Remove pointless memset in fpu_clone()

Zeroing the forked task's FPU registers buffer to avoid leaking init
optimized stale data into the clone is a pointless exercise for the case
where the current task has TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD set. In that case, the FPU
registers state is copied from current's FPU register buffer which can
contain stale init optimized data as well.

The alledged information leak is non-existant because this stale init
optimized data is used nowhere and cannot leak anywhere.
