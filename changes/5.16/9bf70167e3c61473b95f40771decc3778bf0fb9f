mm/filemap: Add readahead_folio()

The pointers stored in the page cache are folios, by definition.
This change comes with a behaviour change -- callers of readahead_folio()
are no longer required to put the page reference themselves.  This matches
how readpage works, rather than matching how readpages used to work.
