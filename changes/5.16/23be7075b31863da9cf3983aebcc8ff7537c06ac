ice: fix software generating extra interrupts

The driver tried to work around missing completion events that occurred
while interrupts are disabled, by triggering a software interrupt
whenever we exit polling (but we had to have polled at least once).

This was causing a *lot* of extra interrupts for some workloads like
NVMe over TCP, which resulted in regressions in performance. It was also
visible when polling didn't prevent interrupts when busy_poll was
enabled.

Fix the extra interrupts by utilizing our previously unused 3rd ITR
(interrupt throttle) index and set it to 20K interrupts per second, and
then trigger a software interrupt within that rate limit.

While here, slightly refactor the code to avoid an overwrite of a local
variable in the case of wb_en = true.
