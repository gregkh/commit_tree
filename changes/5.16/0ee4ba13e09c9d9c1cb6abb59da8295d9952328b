scsi: mpt3sas: Fix kernel panic during drive powercycle test

While looping over shost's sdev list it is possible that one
of the drives is getting removed and its sas_target object is
freed but its sdev object remains intact.

Consequently, a kernel panic can occur while the driver is trying to access
the sas_address field of sas_target object without also checking the
sas_target object for NULL.
