KVM: selftests: Avoid KVM_SET_CPUID2 after KVM_RUN in hyperv_features test

hyperv_features's sole purpose is to test access to various Hyper-V MSRs
and hypercalls with different CPUID data. As KVM_SET_CPUID2 after KVM_RUN
is deprecated and soon-to-be forbidden, avoid it by re-creating test VM
for each sub-test.
