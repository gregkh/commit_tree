perf intel-pt: Support itrace A option to approximate IPC

Normally, for cycle-acccurate mode, IPC values are an exact number of
instructions and cycles. Due to the granularity of timestamps, that happens
only when a CYC packet correlates to the event.

Support the itrace 'A' option, to use instead, the number of cycles
associated with the current timestamp. This provides IPC information for
every change of timestamp, but at the expense of accuracy. Due to the
granularity of timestamps, the actual number of cycles increases even
though the cycles reported does not. The number of instructions is known,
but if IPC is reported, cycles can be too low and so IPC is too high. Note
that inaccuracy decreases as the period of sampling increases i.e. if the
number of cycles is too low by a small amount, that becomes less
significant if the number of cycles is large.

Furthermore, it can be used in conjunction with dlfilter-show-cycles.so
to provide higher granularity cycle information.
