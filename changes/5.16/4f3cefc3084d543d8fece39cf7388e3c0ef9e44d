scsi: smartpqi: Avoid failing I/Os for offline devices

Prevent kernel crash by failing outstanding I/O request when the OS takes
device offline.

When posted I/Os to the controller's inbound queue are not picked by the
controller, the driver will halt the controller and take the controller
offline.

When the driver takes the controller offline, the driver will fail all the
outstanding requests which can sometimes lead to an OS crash.
