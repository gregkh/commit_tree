ARM: dts: socfpga: change qspi to "intel,socfpga-qspi"

Because of commit 9cb2ff111712 ("spi: cadence-quadspi: Disable Auto-HW polling"),
which does a write to the CQSPI_REG_WR_COMPLETION_CTRL register
regardless of any condition. Well, the Cadence QuadSPI controller on
Intel's SoCFPGA platforms does not implement the
CQSPI_REG_WR_COMPLETION_CTRL register, thus a write to this register
results in a crash!

So starting with v5.16, I introduced the patch
98d948eb833 ("spi: cadence-quadspi: fix write completion support"),
which adds the dts compatible "intel,socfpga-qspi" that is specific for
versions that doesn't have the CQSPI_REG_WR_COMPLETION_CTRL register implemented.
