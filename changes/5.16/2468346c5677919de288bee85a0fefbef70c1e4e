net: mscc: ocelot: serialize access to the MAC table

DSA would like to remove the rtnl_lock from its
SWITCHDEV_FDB_{ADD,DEL}_TO_DEVICE handlers, and the felix driver uses
the same MAC table functions as ocelot.

This means that the MAC table functions will no longer be implicitly
serialized with respect to each other by the rtnl_mutex, we need to add
a dedicated lock in ocelot for the non-atomic operations of selecting a
MAC table row, reading/writing what we want and polling for completion.
