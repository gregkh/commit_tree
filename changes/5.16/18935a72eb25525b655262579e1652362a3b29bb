bpf/tests: Fix error in tail call limit tests

This patch fixes an error in the tail call limit test that caused the
test to fail on for x86-64 JIT. Previously, the register R0 was used to
report the total number of tail calls made. However, after a tail call
fall-through, the value of the R0 register is undefined. Now, all tail
call error path tests instead use context state to store the count.
