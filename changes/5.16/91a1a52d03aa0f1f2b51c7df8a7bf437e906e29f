drm/amdgpu: Fix RAS page retirement with mode2 reset on Aldebaran

During mode2 reset, the GPU is temporarily removed from the
mgpu_info list. As a result, page retirement fails because it
cannot find the GPU in the GPU list.
To fix this, create our own list of GPUs that support MCE notifier
based page retirement and use that list to check if the UMC error
occurred on a GPU that supports MCE notifier based page retirement.
