coresight: Update comments for removing cs_etm_find_snapshot()

Commit 2f01c200d440 ("perf cs-etm: Remove callback cs_etm_find_snapshot()")
has removed the function cs_etm_find_snapshot() from the perf tool in the
user space, now CoreSight trace directly uses the perf common function
__auxtrace_mmap__read() to calcualte the head and size for AUX trace data
in snapshot mode.

This patch updates the comments in drivers to make them generic and not
stick to any specific function from perf tool.
