x86/mce: Add errata workaround for Skylake SKX37

Errata SKX37 is word-for-word identical to the other errata listed in
this workaround.   I happened to notice this after investigating a CMCI
storm on a Skylake host.  While I can't confirm this was the root cause,
spurious corrected errors does sound like a likely suspect.
