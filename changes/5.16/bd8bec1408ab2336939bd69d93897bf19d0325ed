ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: move of_node_put to remove function

platforms->of_node and codes->of_node are assigned in probe function,
and of_node_put is called at the end of probe function, because of_node
seems to be not used after probe functon

In this patch, of_node_put is moved to platform remove function in case
of_node is used at any occasions after probe function in the future.
