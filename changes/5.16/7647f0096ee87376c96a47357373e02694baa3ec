drm/i915: Update I915_GEM_BUSY IOCTL to understand composite fences

Parallel submission create composite fences (dma_fence_array) for excl /
shared slots in objects. The I915_GEM_BUSY IOCTL checks these slots to
determine the busyness of the object. Prior to patch it only check if
the fence in the slot was a i915_request. Update the check to understand
composite fences and correctly report the busyness.

v2:
