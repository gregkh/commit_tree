staging: vchiq_core.h: fix CamelCase in function declaration

Renaming function declaration to avoid CamelCase use.

As this was already fixed in the function definition in commit
801b1aa002d3 ("staging: vc04_services: fix CamelCase"), the current
change make the names of the variables in the function definition and
declartion match.
