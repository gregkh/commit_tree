openrisc: fix SMP tlb flush NULL pointer dereference

Throughout the OpenRISC kernel port VMA is passed as NULL when flushing
kernel tlb entries.  Somehow this was missed when I was testing
c28b27416da9 ("openrisc: Implement proper SMP tlb flushing") and now the
SMP kernel fails to completely boot.

In OpenRISC VMA is used only to determine which cores need to have their
TLB entries flushed.

This patch updates the logic to flush tlbs on all cores when the VMA is
passed as NULL.  Also, we update places VMA is passed as NULL to use
flush_tlb_kernel_range instead.  Now, the only place VMA is passed as
NULL is in the implementation of flush_tlb_kernel_range.
