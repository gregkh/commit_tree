Revert "firmware: qcom: scm: Add support for MC boot address API"

This reverts commits 55845f46df03 and c50031f03dfe, since this still
causes a build failure when QCOM_SCM is a loadable module, or when
CONFIG_SMP is disabled:

ERROR: modpost: "cpu_logical_map" [drivers/firmware/qcom-scm.ko] undefined!

This be done better for 5.17, but it's too late now to rework
properly.

Fixes: c50031f03dfe ("firmware: qcom: scm: Don't break compile test on non-ARM platforms")
Fixes: 55845f46df03 ("firmware: qcom: scm: Add support for MC boot address API")
