media: uvcvideo: Increase the size of UVC_METADATA_BUF_SIZE

Hans has discovered that in his test device, for the H264 format
bytesused goes up to about 570, for YUYV it will actually go up
to a bit over 5000 bytes, and for MJPG up to about 2706 bytes.

We should also, according to V4L2_META_FMT_UVC docs, drop headers when
the buffer is full.
