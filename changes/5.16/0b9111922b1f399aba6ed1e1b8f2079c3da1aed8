hamradio: defer 6pack kfree after unregister_netdev

There is a possible race condition (use-after-free) like below

 (USE)                       |  (FREE)
  dev_queue_xmit             |
   __dev_queue_xmit          |
    __dev_xmit_skb           |
     sch_direct_xmit         | ...
      xmit_one               |
       netdev_start_xmit     | tty_ldisc_kill
        __netdev_start_xmit  |  6pack_close
         sp_xmit             |   kfree
          sp_encaps          |
                             |

According to the patch "defer ax25 kfree after unregister_netdev", this
patch reorder the kfree after the unregister_netdev to avoid the possible
UAF as the unregister_netdev() is well synchronized and won't return if
there is a running routine.
