locks: remove LOCK_MAND flock lock support

As best I can tell, the logic for these has been broken for a long time
(at least before the move to git), such that they never conflict with
anything. Also, nothing checks for these flags and prevented opens or
read/write behavior on the files. They don't seem to do anything.

Given that, we can rip these symbols out of the kernel, and just make
flock(2) return 0 when LOCK_MAND is set in order to preserve existing
behavior.
