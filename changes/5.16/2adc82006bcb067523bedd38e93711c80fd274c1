cifs: add server conn_id to fscache client cookie

The fscache client cookie uses the server address
(and port) as the cookie key. This is a problem when
nosharesock is used. Two different connections will
use duplicate cookies. Avoid this by adding
server->conn_id to the key, so that it's guaranteed
that cookie will not be duplicated.

Also, for secondary channels of a session, copy the
fscache pointer from the primary channel. The primary
channel is guaranteed not to go away as long as secondary
channels are in use.  Also addresses minor problem found
by kernel test robot.
