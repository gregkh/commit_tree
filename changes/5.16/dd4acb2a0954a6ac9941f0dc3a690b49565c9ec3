net/mlx5: DR, Add missing query for vport 0

Currently, vport 0 capabilities are not set.
To fix this, we now querying both eswitch manager and vport 0.
Eswitch manager has an access to all the vports - for eswitch manager PF, all
vports can be referred as other vports. The exception is embedded CPU mode,
where there is vport 0 of ECPF and the PF vport 0.

Here is how vport are queried:

For Connect-X5/6:
    PF vport (0) and vports 1..n: vport number, other = true
    esw_manager is vport 0 (PF)
For BlueField (in embedded CPU mode):
    ECPF vport: vport = 0, other = false
    PF vport (0) and 1..n: vport number, other = true
    esw_manager = vport 0 (ECPF)

Also, note that there's no need for other_vport function parameter
in dr_domain_query_vport - this value is now deduced locally in the
function.
