mm/page_owner.c: modify the type of argument "order" in some functions

The type of "order" in struct page_owner is unsigned short.
However, it is unsigned int in the following 3 functions:

  __reset_page_owner
  __set_page_owner_handle
  __set_page_owner_handle

The type of "order" in argument list is unsigned int, which is
inconsistent.
