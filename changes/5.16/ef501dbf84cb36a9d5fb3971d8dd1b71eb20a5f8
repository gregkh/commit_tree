drm/msm/dp: Refactor ioremap wrapper

In order to deal with multiple memory ranges in the following commit
change the ioremap wrapper to not poke directly into the dss_io_data
struct.

While at it, devm_ioremap_resource() already prints useful error
messages on failure, so omit the unnecessary prints from the caller.
