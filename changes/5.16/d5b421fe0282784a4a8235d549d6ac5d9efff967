docs: Explain the desired position of function attributes

While discussing how to format the addition of various function
attributes, some "unwritten rules" of ordering surfaced[1]. Capture as
close as possible to Linus's preferences for future reference.

(Though I note the dissent voiced by Joe Perches, Alexey Dobriyan, and
others that would prefer all attributes live on a separate leading line.)
