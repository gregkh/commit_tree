Input: goodix - allow specifying the config filename

The config which needs to be send to the controller on some device-models
is model-specific. Allow specifying a model-specific filename through
a device-property, rather then always using a fixed filename.

Note the "goodix,config-name" device-property used by this is
*not* documented in the
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/touchscreen/goodix.yaml
device-tree bindings for now.

Not documenting these is intentional. This is done because this code has
only been tested on x86/ACPI so far, where devicetree is not used.
Instead these properties are set through a software-fwnode attached to the
device by the drivers/platform/x86/touchscreen_dmi.c code. This means that
the use of this property for now is purely a kernel-internal thing and
the name/working of the property may still be changed for now.
