NFC: add necessary privilege flags in netlink layer

The CAP_NET_ADMIN checks are needed to prevent attackers faking a
device under NCIUARTSETDRIVER and exploit privileged commands.

This patch add GENL_ADMIN_PERM flags in genl_ops to fulfill the check.
Except for commands like NFC_CMD_GET_DEVICE, NFC_CMD_GET_TARGET,
NFC_CMD_LLC_GET_PARAMS, and NFC_CMD_GET_SE, which are mainly information-
read operations.
