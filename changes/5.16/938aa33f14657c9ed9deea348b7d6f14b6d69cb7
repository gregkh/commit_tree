tracing: Add length protection to histogram string copies

The string copies to the histogram storage has a max size of 256 bytes
(defined by MAX_FILTER_STR_VAL). Only the string size of the event field
needs to be copied to the event storage, but no more than what is in the
event storage. Although nothing should be bigger than 256 bytes, there's
no protection against overwriting of the storage if one day there is.

Copy no more than the destination size, and enforce it.

Also had to turn MAX_FILTER_STR_VAL into an unsigned int, to keep the
min() comparison of the string sizes of comparable types.
