iio: inkern: introduce devm_iio_map_array_register() short-hand function

This change introduces a device-managed variant to the
iio_map_array_register() function. It's a simple implementation of calling
iio_map_array_register() and registering a callback to
iio_map_array_unregister() with the devm_add_action_or_reset().

The function uses an explicit 'dev' parameter to bind the unwinding to. It
could have been implemented to implicitly use the parent of the IIO device,
however it shouldn't be too expensive to callers to just specify to which
device object to bind this unwind call.
It would make the API a bit more flexible.
