perf evsel: Fix missing exclude_{host,guest} setting

The current logic for the perf missing feature has a bug that it can
wrongly clear some modifiers like G or H.  Actually some PMUs don't
support any filtering or exclusion while others do.  But we check it as
a global feature.

For example, the cycles event can have 'G' modifier to enable it only in
the guest mode on x86.  When you don't run any VMs it'll return 0.

  # perf stat -a -e cycles:G sleep 1

    Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

                    0      cycles:G

          1.000721670 seconds time elapsed

But when it's used with other pmu events that don't support G modifier,
it'll be reset and return non-zero values.

  # perf stat -a -e cycles:G,msr/tsc/ sleep 1

    Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

          538,029,960      cycles:G
       16,924,010,738      msr/tsc/

          1.001815327 seconds time elapsed

This is because of the missing feature detection logic being global.
Add a hashmap to set pmu-specific exclude_host/guest features.

Committer notes:

Fix 'perf test python' by adding a stub for evsel__find_pmu() in
tools/perf/util/python.c, document that it is used so far only for the
above reasons so that if anybody needs this in the python binding
usecases, we can revisit this.
