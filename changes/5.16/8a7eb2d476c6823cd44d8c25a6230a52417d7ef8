Drivers: hv: balloon: Use VMBUS_RING_SIZE() wrapper for dm_ring_size

Baihua reported an error when boot an ARM64 guest with PAGE_SIZE=64k and
BALLOON is enabled:

	hv_vmbus: registering driver hv_balloon
	hv_vmbus: probe failed for device 1eccfd72-4b41-45ef-b73a-4a6e44c12924 (-22)

The cause of this is that the ringbuffer size for hv_balloon is not
adjusted with VMBUS_RING_SIZE(), which makes the size not large enough
for ringbuffers on guest with PAGE_SIZE=64k. Therefore use
VMBUS_RING_SIZE() to calculate the ringbuffer size. Note that the old
size (20 * 1024) counts a 4k header in the total size, while
VMBUS_RING_SIZE() expects the parameter as the payload size, so use
16 * 1024.
