tools headers cpufeatures: Sync with the kernel sources

To pick the changes from:

  eec2113eabd92b7b ("x86/fpu/amx: Define AMX state components and have it used for boot-time checks")

This only causes these perf files to be rebuilt:

  CC       /tmp/build/perf/bench/mem-memcpy-x86-64-asm.o
  CC       /tmp/build/perf/bench/mem-memset-x86-64-asm.o

And addresses this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h
