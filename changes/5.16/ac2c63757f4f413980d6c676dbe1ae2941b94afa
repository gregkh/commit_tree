orangefs: Fix sb refcount leak when allocate sb info failed.

The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling
path of orangefs_mount(). When failing to allocate sb info, the
function forgets to decrease the refcount of sb increased by
sget(), causing a refcount leak.

Fix this issue by jumping to the label "free_sb_and_op" instead
of "free_op"
