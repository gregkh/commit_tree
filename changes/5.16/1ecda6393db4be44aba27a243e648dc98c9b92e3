media: allegro: ignore interrupt if mailbox is not initialized

The mailbox is initialized after the interrupt handler is installed. As
the firmware is loaded and started even later, it should not happen that
the interrupt occurs without the mailbox being initialized.

As the Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org) keeps
reporting this as an error, add a check to ignore interrupts before the
mailbox is initialized to fix this potential null pointer dereference.
