cxl/pci: Remove pci request/release regions

Quoting Dan, "... the request + release regions should probably just be
dropped. It's not like any of the register enumeration would collide
with someone else who already has the registers mapped. The collision
only comes when the registers are mapped for their final usage, and that
will have more precision in the request."
