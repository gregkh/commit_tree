KVM: arm64: Save PSTATE early on exit

In order to be able to use primitives such as vcpu_mode_is_32bit(),
we need to synchronize the guest PSTATE. However, this is currently
done deep into the bowels of the world-switch code, and we do have
helpers evaluating this much earlier (__vgic_v3_perform_cpuif_access
and handle_aarch32_guest, for example).

Move the saving of the guest pstate into the early fixups, which
cures the first issue. The second one will be addressed separately.
