net: stmmac: socfpga: add runtime suspend/resume callback for stratix10 platform

According to upstream commit 5ec55823438e("net: stmmac:
add clocks management for gmac driver"), it improve clocks
management for stmmac driver. So, it is necessary to implement
the runtime callback in dwmac-socfpga driver because it doesn't
use the common stmmac_pltfr_pm_ops instance. Otherwise, clocks
are not disabled when system enters suspend status.
