rcu: Eliminate rcu_implicit_dynticks_qs() local variable ruqp

The rcu_implicit_dynticks_qs() function's local variable ruqp references
the ->rcu_urgent_qs field in the rcu_data structure referenced by the
function parameter rdp, with a rather odd method for computing the
pointer to this field.  This commit therefore simplifies things and
saves a couple of lines of code by replacing each instance of ruqp with
&rdp->need_heavy_qs.
