net/mlx5: Let user configure max_macs param

Currently, max_macs is taking 70Kbytes of memory per function. This
size is not needed in all use cases, and is critical with large scale.
Hence, allow user to configure the number of max_macs.

For example, to reduce the number of max_macs to 1, execute::
$ devlink dev param set pci/0000:00:0b.0 name max_macs value 1 \
              cmode driverinit
$ devlink dev reload pci/0000:00:0b.0
