xfs: prepare xfs_btree_cur for dynamic cursor heights

Split out the btree level information into a separate struct and put it
at the end of the cursor structure as a VLA.  Files with huge data forks
(and in the future, the realtime rmap btree) will require the ability to
support many more levels than a per-AG btree cursor, which means that
we're going to create per-btree type cursor caches to conserve memory
for the more common case.

Note that a subsequent patch actually introduces dynamic cursor heights.
This one merely rearranges the structure to prepare for that.
