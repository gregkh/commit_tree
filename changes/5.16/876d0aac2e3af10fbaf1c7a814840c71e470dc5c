docs/vm/damon: remove broken reference

Building DAMON documents warns for a reference to nonexisting doc, as
below:

    $ time make htmldocs
    [...]
    Documentation/vm/damon/index.rst:24: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document 'vm/damon/plans'

This fixes the warning by removing the wrong reference.
