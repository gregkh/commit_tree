drm/i915/uncore: Drop gen11/gen12 mmio write handlers

Now that the reference to the shadow table is stored within the uncore,
we don't need to generate separate fwtable, gen11_fwtable, and
gen12_fwtable variants of the register write functions; a single
'fwtable' implementation will work for all of those platforms now.

While consolidating the functions, gen11/gen12 pick up a
NEEDS_FORCE_WAKE() check that they didn't have before, allowing them to
bypass a lot of forcewake/shadow checking for non-GT registers (e.g.,
display).  However since these later platforms also introduce media
engines at higher MMIO offsets, the definition of NEEDS_FORCE_WAKE() is
extended to also consider register offsets above GEN11_BSD_RING_BASE.

v2:
 - Restore NEEDS_FORCE_WAKE(), but extend it for compatibility with the
   gen11+ platforms by also passing offsets above GEN11_BSD_RING_BASE.
