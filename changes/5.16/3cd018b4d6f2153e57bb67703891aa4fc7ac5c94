mm/swap.c:put_pages_list(): reinitialise the page list

While free_unref_page_list() puts pages onto the CPU local LRU list, it
does not remove them from the list they were passed in on.  That makes
the list_head appear to be non-empty, and would lead to various
corruption problems if we didn't have an assertion that the list was
empty.

Reinitialise the list after calling free_unref_page_list() to avoid this
problem.
