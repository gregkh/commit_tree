net/mlx5e: Rename TIR lro functions to TIR packet merge functions

This series introduces new packet merge type, therefore rename lro
functions to packet merge to support the new merge type:
- Generalize + rename mlx5e_build_tir_ctx_lro to
  mlx5e_build_tir_ctx_packet_merge.
- Rename mlx5e_modify_tirs_lro to mlx5e_modify_tirs_packet_merge.
- Rename lro bit in mlx5_ifc_modify_tir_bitmask_bits to packet_merge.
- Rename lro_en in mlx5e_params to packet_merge_type type and combine
  packet_merge params into one struct mlx5e_packet_merge_param.
