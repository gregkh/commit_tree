net/mlx5: E-Switch, fix single FDB creation on BlueField

Always use MLX5_FLOW_TABLE_OTHER_VPORT flag when creating egress ACL
table for single FDB. Not doing so on BlueField will make firmware fail
the command. On BlueField the E-Switch manager is the ECPF (vport 0xFFFE)
which is filled in the flow table creation command but as the
other_vport field wasn't set the firmware complains about a bad parameter.

This is different from a regular HCA where the E-Switch manager vport is
the PF (vport 0x0). Passing MLX5_FLOW_TABLE_OTHER_VPORT will make the
firmware happy both on BlueField and on regular HCAs without special
condition for each.

This fixes the bellow firmware syndrome:
mlx5_cmd_check:819:(pid 571): CREATE_FLOW_TABLE(0x930) op_mod(0x0) failed, status bad parameter(0x3), syndrome (0x754a4)
