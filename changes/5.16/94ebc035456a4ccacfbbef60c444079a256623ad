drm/amd/display: Allow DSC on supported MST branch devices

[Why]
When trying to lightup two 4k60 non-DSC displays behind a branch device
that supports DSC we can't lightup both at once due to bandwidth
limitations - each requires 48 VCPI slots but we only have 63.

[How]
The workaround already exists in the code but is guarded by a CONFIG
that cannot be set by the user and shouldn't need to be.

Check for specific branch device IDs to device whether to enable
the workaround for multiple display scenarios.
