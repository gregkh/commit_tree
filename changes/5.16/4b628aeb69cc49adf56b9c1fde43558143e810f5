io_uring: kill off ios_left

->ios_left is only used to decide whether to plug or not, kill it to
avoid this extra accounting, just use the initial submission number.
There is no much difference in regards of enabling plugging, where this
one does it in a few more cases, but all major ones should be covered
well.
