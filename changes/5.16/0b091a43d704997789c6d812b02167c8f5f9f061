KVM: selftests: vmx_pmu_msrs_test: Drop tests mangling guest visible CPUIDs

Host initiated writes to MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES should not depend
on guest visible CPUIDs and (incorrect) KVM logic implementing it is
about to change. Also, KVM_SET_CPUID{,2} after KVM_RUN is now forbidden
and causes test to fail.
