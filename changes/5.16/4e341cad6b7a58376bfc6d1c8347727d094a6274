tracing: Fix selftest config check for function graph start up test

There's a new test in trace_selftest_startup_function_graph() that
requires the use of ftrace args being supported as well does some tricks
with dynamic tracing. Although this code checks HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_ARGS
it fails to check DYNAMIC_FTRACE, and the kernel fails to build due to
that dependency.

Also only define the prototype of trace_direct_tramp() if it is used.
