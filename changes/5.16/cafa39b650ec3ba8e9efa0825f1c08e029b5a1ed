ASoC: soc-acpi: add comp_ids field for machine driver matching

A machine driver needs to be enumerated by more than one ACPI HID if
it supports second headphone driver (i.e. rt5682 and rt5682s).
However, the id field in snd_soc_acpi_mach structure could contain
only one HID. By adding a 'comp_ids' field which can contain several
HIDs, we can enumerate a machine driver by multiple ACPI HIDs.
