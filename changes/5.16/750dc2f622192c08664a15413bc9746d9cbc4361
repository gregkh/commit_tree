ASoC: rt5682s: Fix crash due to out of scope stack vars

Move the declaration of temporary arrays to somewhere that won't go out
of scope before the devm_clk_hw_register() call, lest we be at the whim
of the compiler for whether those stack variables get overwritten.

Fixes a crash seen with gcc version 11.2.1 20210728 (Red Hat 11.2.1-1)

Fixes: bdd229ab26be ("ASoC: rt5682s: Add driver for ALC5682I-VS codec")
