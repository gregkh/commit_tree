KVM: selftests: Start at iteration 0 instead of -1

Start at iteration 0 instead of -1 to avoid having to initialize
vcpu_last_completed_iteration when setting up vCPU threads. This
simplifies the next commit where we move vCPU thread initialization
out to a common helper.

No functional change intended.
