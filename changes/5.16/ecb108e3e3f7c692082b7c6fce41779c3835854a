ARM: 9144/1: forbid ftrace with clang and thumb2_kernel

clang fails to build kernels with THUMB2 and FUNCTION_TRACER
enabled when there is any inline asm statement containing
the frame pointer register r7:

arch/arm/mach-exynos/mcpm-exynos.c:154:2: error: inline asm clobber list contains reserved registers: R7 [-Werror,-Winline-asm]
arch/arm/probes/kprobes/actions-thumb.c:449:3: error: inline asm clobber list contains reserved registers: R7 [-Werror,-Winline-asm]

Apparently gcc should also have warned about this, and the
configuration is actually invalid, though there is some
disagreement on the bug trackers about this.
