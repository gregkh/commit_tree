ASoC: SOF: Drop SOF_DBG_DUMP_FORCE_ERR_LEVEL and sof_dev_dbg_or_err

The sof_dev_dbg_or_err() is only used by intel/hda.c when dumping dsp
debug information.
It was used to print the extended rom status in either dev_dbg (during
retries) and finally with dev_err, but other lines were printed with
dev_err regardless.

Since we now only print the dump once, the flag and the macros is no longer
needed.
