iwlwifi: rename GEO_TX_POWER_LIMIT to PER_CHAIN_LIMIT_OFFSET_CMD

When this code was implemented, there was no official FW API
description yet, so a placeholder name was used (GEO_TX_POWER_LIMIT).
But then the command became actually called
PER_CHAIN_LIMIT_OFFSET_CMD.  Rename the command (and change related
comments) to PER_CHAIN_LIMIT_OFFSET_CMD to avoid confusion.
