RDMA/bnxt_re: Reduce the delay in polling for hwrm command completion

Driver has 1ms delay between the polling for atomic command completion.
Polling immediately after issuing command usually doesn't report any
completions. So all commands in the blocking path needs two iterations. So
effectively 1ms spend on each command. HW requires much lesser time for
each command. So reduce the delay to 1us and increase the iteration count
to wait for the same time.
