counter: drop chrdev_lock

This removes the chrdev_lock from the counter subsystem. This was
intended to prevent opening the chrdev more than once. However, this
doesn't work in practice since userspace can duplicate file descriptors
and pass file descriptors to other processes. Since this protection
can't be relied on, it is best to just remove it.
