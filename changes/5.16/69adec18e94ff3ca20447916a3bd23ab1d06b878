KVM: arm64: Fix reporting of endianess when the access originates at EL0

We currently check SCTLR_EL1.EE when computing the address of
a faulting guest access. However, the fault could have occured at
EL0, in which case the right bit to check would be SCTLR_EL1.E0E.

This is pretty unlikely to cause any issue in practice: You'd have
to have a guest with a LE EL1 and a BE EL0 (or the other way around),
and have mapped a device into the EL0 page tables.

Good luck with that!
