net: ax88796c: ASIX AX88796C SPI Ethernet Adapter Driver

ASIX AX88796[1] is a versatile ethernet adapter chip, that can be
connected to a CPU with a 8/16-bit bus or with an SPI. This driver
supports SPI connection.

The driver has been ported from the vendor kernel for ARTIK5[2]
boards. Several changes were made to adapt it to the current kernel
which include:

+ updated DT configuration,
+ clock configuration moved to DT,
+ new timer, ethtool and gpio APIs,
+ dev_* instead of pr_* and custom printk() wrappers,
+ removed awkward vendor power managemtn.
+ introduced ethtool tunable to control SPI compression

The other ax88796 driver is for NE2000 compatible AX88796L chip. These
chips are not compatible. Hence, two separate drivers are required.
