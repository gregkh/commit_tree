arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074-hk01: Add dummy supply for QMP USB3 PHY

Per QMP PHY bindings schema, 'vdda-phy-supply' and 'vdda-phy-supply' are
required for IPQ8074 QMP USB3 PHY.  Since supplies are not added in DTS
for this platform, add a dummy regulator as the supply to QMP USB3 PHY,
so that dtbs_check stops complaining the missing supplies.
