Revert "block: reduce kblockd_mod_delayed_work_on() CPU consumption"

This reverts commit cb2ac2912a9ca7d3d26291c511939a41361d2d83.

Alex and the kernel test robot report that this causes a significant
performance regression with BFQ. I can reproduce that result, so let's
revert this one as we're close to -rc6 and we there's no point in trying
to rush a fix.
