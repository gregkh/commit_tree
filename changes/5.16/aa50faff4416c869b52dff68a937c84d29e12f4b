PCI: mt7621: Convert driver into 'bool'

The driver is not ready yet to be compiled as a module since it depends
on some symbols not exported on MIPS.  We have the following current
problems:

  Building mips:allmodconfig ... failed
  --------------
  Error log:
  ERROR: modpost: missing MODULE_LICENSE() in drivers/pci/controller/pcie-mt7621.o

  ERROR: modpost: "mips_gcr_base" [drivers/pci/controller/pcie-mt7621.ko] undefined!

Temporarily move from 'tristate' to 'bool' until a better solution is
ready.

Also RALINK is redundant because SOC_MT7621 already depends on it.
Hence, simplify condition.
