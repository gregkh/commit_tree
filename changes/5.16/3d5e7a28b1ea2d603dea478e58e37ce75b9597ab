KVM: x86: avoid warning with -Wbitwise-instead-of-logical

This is a new warning in clang top-of-tree (will be clang 14):

In file included from arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:27:
arch/x86/kvm/mmu/spte.h:318:9: error: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Werror,-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
        return __is_bad_mt_xwr(rsvd_check, spte) |
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                                 ||
arch/x86/kvm/mmu/spte.h:318:9: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning

The code is fine, but change it anyway to shut up this clever clogs
of a compiler.
