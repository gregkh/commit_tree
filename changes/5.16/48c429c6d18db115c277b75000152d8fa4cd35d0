drm/connector: Add a fwnode pointer to drm_connector and register with ACPI (v2)

Add a fwnode pointer to struct drm_connector and register an acpi_bus_type
for the connectors with the ACPI subsystem (when CONFIG_ACPI is enabled).

The adding of the fwnode pointer allows drivers to associate a fwnode
that represents a connector with that connector.

When the new fwnode pointer points to an ACPI-companion, then the new
acpi_bus_type will cause the ACPI subsys to bind the device instantiated
for the connector with the fwnode by calling acpi_bind_one(). This will
result in a firmware_node symlink under /sys/class/card#-<connecter-name>/
which helps to verify that the fwnode-s and connectors are properly
matched.

Changes in v2:
- Make drm_connector_cleanup() call fwnode_handle_put() on
  connector->fwnode and document this
