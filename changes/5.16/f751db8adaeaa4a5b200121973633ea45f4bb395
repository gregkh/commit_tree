powercap/drivers/dtpm: Disable DTPM at boot time

The DTPM framework misses a mechanism to set it up. That is currently
under review but will come after the next cycle.

As the distro are enabling all the kernel options, the DTPM framework
is enabled on platforms where the energy model is not implemented,
thus making the framework inconsistent and disrupting the CPU
frequency scaling service.

Remove the initialization at boot time as a hot fix.
