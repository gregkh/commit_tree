rtc: handle alarms with a minute resolution

Handle alarms with a minute resolution in the core. Until now drivers have
been open coding the seconds part removal and have been doing that wrongly.
Most of them are rounding up which means the allow the system to miss
deadlines. So, round down and let __rtc_set_alarm return immediately if the
time has already passed.
