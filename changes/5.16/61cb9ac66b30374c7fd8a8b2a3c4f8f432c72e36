powerpc/vas: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

(!ptr && !ptr->foo) strikes again. :)

The expression (!ptr && !ptr->foo) is bogus and in case ptr is NULL,
it leads to a NULL pointer dereference: ptr->foo.

Fix this by converting && to ||

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle, and audited and
fixed manually.
