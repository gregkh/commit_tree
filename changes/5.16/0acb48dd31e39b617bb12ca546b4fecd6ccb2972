ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: make sure DAI widget is set up before IPC

With the implementation of the dynamic pipeline feature, widgets
will only be setup when a PCM is opened during the
hw_params ioctl. The BE hw_params callback is responsible for
sending the DAI_CONFIG for the DAI widgets in the DSP.
With dynamic pipelines, the DAI widgets will need to set up
first before sending the DAI_CONFIG IPC in the BE hw_params.

Update the BE hw_params/hw_free callbacks for all ALH, HDA and SSP
DAIs to set up/free the DAI widget before/after DAI_CONFIG IPC.
