spi: cadence-quadspi: fix write completion support

Some versions of the Cadence QSPI controller does not have the write
completion register implemented(CQSPI_REG_WR_COMPLETION_CTRL). On the
Intel SoCFPGA platform the CQSPI_REG_WR_COMPLETION_CTRL register is
not configured.

Add a quirk to not write to the CQSPI_REG_WR_COMPLETION_CTRL register.
