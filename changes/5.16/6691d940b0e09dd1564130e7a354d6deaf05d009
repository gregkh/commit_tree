f2fs: introduce fragment allocation mode mount option

Added two options into "mode=" mount option to make it possible for
developers to simulate filesystem fragmentation/after-GC situation
itself. The developers use these modes to understand filesystem
fragmentation/after-GC condition well, and eventually get some
insights to handle them better.

"fragment:segment": f2fs allocates a new segment in ramdom position.
		With this, we can simulate the after-GC condition.
"fragment:block" : We can scatter block allocation with
		"max_fragment_chunk" and "max_fragment_hole" sysfs
		nodes. f2fs will allocate 1..<max_fragment_chunk>
		blocks in a chunk and make a hole in the length of
		1..<max_fragment_hole> by turns	in a newly allocated
		free segment. Plus, this mode implicitly enables
		"fragment:segment" option for more randomness.
