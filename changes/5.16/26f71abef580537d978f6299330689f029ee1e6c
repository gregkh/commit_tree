phy: qcom-qmp: another fix for the sc8180x PCIe definition

Commit f839f14e24f2 ("phy: qcom-qmp: Add sc8180x PCIe support") added
SC8180X PCIe tables, but used sm8250_qmp_pcie_serdes_tbl as a serdes
table because of the copy paste error. Commit bfccd9a71a08 ("phy:
qcom-qmp: Fix sc8180x PCIe definition") corrected part of this mistake
by pointing serdes_tbl to sc8180x_qmp_pcie_serdes_tbl, however the
serdes_tbl_num field was not updated to use sc8180x table. So let's now
fix the serdes_tbl_num field too.
