coresight: trbe: Decouple buffer base from the hardware base

We always set the TRBBASER_EL1 to the base of the virtual ring
buffer. We are about to change this for working around an erratum.
So, in preparation to that, allow the driver to choose a different
base for the TRBBASER_EL1 (which is within the buffer range).
