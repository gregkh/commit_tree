Documentation/process: Add maintainer handbooks section

General rules for patch submission, coding style and related details are
available, but most subsystems have their subsystem-specific extra rules
which differ or go beyond the common rules.

Mark suggested to add a subsystem/maintainer handbook section, where
subsystem maintainers can explain their specific quirks.

Add the section and link to it from the submitting-patches document.
