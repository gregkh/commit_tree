io_uring: clusterise ki_flags access in rw_prep

ioprio setup doesn't depend on other fields that are modified in
io_prep_rw() and we can move it down in the function without worrying
about performance. It's useful as it makes iocb->ki_flags
accesses/modifications closer together, so it's more likely the compiler
will cache it in a register and avoid extra reloads.
