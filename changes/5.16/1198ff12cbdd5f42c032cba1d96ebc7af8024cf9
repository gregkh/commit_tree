ASoC: topology: Fix stub for snd_soc_tplg_component_remove()

When removing the index argument from snd_soc_topology_component_remove()
commit a5b8f71c5477f (ASoC: topology: Remove multistep topology loading)
forgot to update the stub for !SND_SOC_TOPOLOGY use, causing build failures
for anything that tries to make use of it.
