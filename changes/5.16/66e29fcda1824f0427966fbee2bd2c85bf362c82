parisc/kgdb: add kgdb_roundup() to make kgdb work with idle polling

With idle polling, IPIs are not sent when a CPU idle, but queued
and run later from do_idle(). The default kgdb_call_nmi_hook()
implementation gets the pointer to struct pt_regs from get_irq_reqs(),
which doesn't work in that case because it was not called from the
IPI interrupt handler. Fix it by defining our own kgdb_roundup()
function which sents an IPI_ENTER_KGDB. When that IPI is received
on the target CPU kgdb_nmicallback() is called.
