arm64: ftrace: use function_nocfi for _mcount as well

Commit 800618f955a9 ("arm64: ftrace: use function_nocfi for ftrace_call")
only fixed address of ftrace_call but address of _mcount needs to be
fixed as well. Use function_nocfi() to get the actual address of _mcount
function as with CONFIG_CFI_CLANG, the compiler replaces function pointers
with jump table addresses which breaks dynamic ftrace as the address of
_mcount is replaced with the address of _mcount.cfi_jt.

With mainline, this won't be a problem since by default
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS=y with Clang >= 10 as it supports
-fpatchable-function-entry and CFI requires Clang 12 but for consistency
we should add function_nocfi() for _mcount as well.
