net/mlx5: Support partial TTC rules

Add bitmasks to ttc_params to indicate if rule is valid or not.
It will allow to create TTC table with support only in part of the
traffic types.
In later patches which introduce the steering based LAG port selection,
TTC will be created with only part of the rules according to the hash
type.
