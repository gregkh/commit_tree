drm/i915/gvt: fix the usage of ww lock in gvt scheduler.

As the APIs related to ww lock in i915 was changed recently, the usage of
ww lock in GVT-g scheduler needs to be changed accrodingly. We noticed a
deadlock when GVT-g scheduler submits the workload to i915. After some
investigation, it seems the way of how to use ww lock APIs has been
changed. Releasing a ww now requires a explicit i915_gem_ww_ctx_fini().
