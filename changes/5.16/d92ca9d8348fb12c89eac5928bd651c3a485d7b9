blk-mq: don't handle non-flush requests in blk_insert_flush

Return to the normal blk_mq_submit_bio flow if the bio did not end up
actually being a flush because the device didn't support it.  Note that
this is basically impossible to hit without special instrumentation given
that submit_bio_checks already clears these flags usually, so we'd need a
tight race to actually hit this code path.

With this the call to blk_mq_run_hw_queue for the flush requests can be
removed given that the actual flush requests are always issued via the
requeue workqueue which runs the queue unconditionally.
