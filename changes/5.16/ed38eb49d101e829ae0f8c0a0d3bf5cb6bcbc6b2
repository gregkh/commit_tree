cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix active mode offline/online EPP handling

After commit 4adcf2e5829f ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Add ->offline and
->online callbacks") the EPP value set by the "performance" scaling
algorithm in the active mode is not restored after an offline/online
cycle which replaces it with the saved EPP value coming from user
space.

Address this issue by forcing intel_pstate_hwp_set() to set a new
EPP value when it runs first time after online.
