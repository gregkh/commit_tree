scsi: lpfc: Improve PBDE checks during SGL processing

The PBDE feature, setting payload buffer address explicitly in the WQE so
it doesn't have to be fetched from the SGL, only makes sense when there is
a single buffer for the I/O. When there are multiple buffers it actually
hurts performance as the SGL subsequently has to be fetched.

Rework the SGL logic to only use PBDE when a single buffer.
