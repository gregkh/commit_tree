ASoC: fix unmet dependencies on GPIOLIB for SND_SOC_DMIC

When SND_SOC_AMD_RENOIR_MACH or SND_SOC_AMD_RV_RT5682_MACH
are selected, and GPIOLIB is not selected, Kbuild gives
the following warnings, respectively:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SND_SOC_DMIC
  Depends on [n]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && GPIOLIB [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - SND_SOC_AMD_RENOIR_MACH [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_SOC_AMD_RENOIR [=y]

and

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SND_SOC_MAX98357A
  Depends on [n]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && GPIOLIB [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - SND_SOC_AMD_RV_RT5682_MACH [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && SND_SOC_AMD_ACP3x [=y] && I2C [=y] && CROS_EC [=y]

This is because SND_SOC_DMIC and SND_SOC_MAX98357A are
selected by SND_SOC_AMD_RV_RT5682_MACH and SND_SOC_AMD_RENOIR_MACH,
respectively. However, neither of the selectors depend on or select GPIOLIB,
despite their selectees depending on GPIOLIB.

These unmet dependency bugs were detected by Kismet,
a static analysis tool for Kconfig. Please advise if this
is not the appropriate solution.
