tomoyo: Check exceeded quota early in tomoyo_domain_quota_is_ok().

If tomoyo is used in a testing/fuzzing environment in learning mode,
for lots of domains the quota will be exceeded and stay exceeded
for prolonged periods of time. In such cases it's pointless (and slow)
to walk the whole acl list again and again just to rediscover that
the quota is exceeded. We already have the TOMOYO_DIF_QUOTA_WARNED flag
that notes the overflow condition. Check it early to avoid the slowdown.

This patch causes a user visible change that the learning mode will not be
automatically resumed after the quota is increased. To resume the learning
mode, administrator will need to explicitly clear TOMOYO_DIF_QUOTA_WARNED
flag after increasing the quota. But I think that this change is generally
preferable, for administrator likely wants to optimize the acl list for
that domain before increasing the quota, or that domain likely hits the
quota again. Therefore, don't try to care to clear TOMOYO_DIF_QUOTA_WARNED
flag automatically when the quota for that domain changed.
