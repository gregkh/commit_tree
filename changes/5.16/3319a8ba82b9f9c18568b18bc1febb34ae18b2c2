scsi: ibmvscsi: Use GFP_KERNEL with dma_alloc_coherent() in initialize_event_pool()

During driver probe we allocate a dma region for our event pool.
Currently, zero is passed for the gfp_flags parameter. Driver probe
callbacks are run in process context and we hold no locks so we can sleep
here if necessary.

Fix by passing GFP_KERNEL explicitly to dma_alloc_coherent().
