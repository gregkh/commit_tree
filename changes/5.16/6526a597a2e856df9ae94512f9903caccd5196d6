s390/pci: add simpler s390dbf traces for events

We often need to figure out what operations were performed in response
to an error or availability event. The operations are easily accessible
in s390dbf/pci_msg but the events have to be correlated with these from
either the kernel log or s390dbf/pci_err. Improve this situation by
logging the most important data from error and availability events that
is the FID, PEC and FH together with the operations.
