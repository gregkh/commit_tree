irq: riscv: perform irqentry in entry code

In preparation for removing HANDLE_DOMAIN_IRQ_IRQENTRY, have arch/riscv
perform all the irqentry accounting in its entry code. As arch/riscv
uses GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER, we can use generic_handle_arch_irq() to
do so.

Since generic_handle_arch_irq() handles the irq entry and setting the
irq regs, and happens before the irqchip code calls handle_IPI(), we can
remove the redundant irq entry and irq regs manipulation from
handle_IPI().

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
