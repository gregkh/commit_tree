ASoC: dt-bindings: rename q6afe.h to q6dsp-lpass-ports.h

move all LPASS audio ports defines from q6afe.h to q6dsp-lpass-ports.h
as these belong to LPASS IP.
Also this move helps in reusing this header across multiple audio
frameworks on Qualcomm Audio DSP.

This patch is split out of the dt-bindings patch to enable easy review.
