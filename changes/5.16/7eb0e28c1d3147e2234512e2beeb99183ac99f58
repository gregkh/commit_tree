sysv: use BUILD_BUG_ON instead of runtime check

There were runtime checks about sizes of struct v7_super_block and struct
sysv_inode.  If one of these checks fail the kernel will panic.  Since
these values are known at compile time let's use BUILD_BUG_ON(), because
it's a standard mechanism for validation checking at build time
