drm/i915/guc: Don't touch guc_state.sched_state without a lock

Before we did some clever tricks to not use the a lock when touching
guc_state.sched_state in certain cases. Don't do that, enforce the use
of the lock.

v2:
 (kernel test robo )
  - Add __maybe_unused to sched_state_is_init()

v3: rebase after the unused code path removal has been moved to an
earlier patch.
