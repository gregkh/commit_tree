Docs/admin-guide/mm/damon/start: simplify the content

Information in 'TL; DR' section of 'Getting Started' is duplicated in
other parts of the doc.  It is also asking readers to visit the access
pattern visualizations gallery web site to show the results of example
visualization commands, while the users of the commands can use terminal
output.

To make the doc simple, this removes the duplicated 'TL; DR' section and
replaces the visualization example commands with versions using terminal
outputs.
