KVM: X86: pair smp_wmb() of mmu_try_to_unsync_pages() with smp_rmb()

The commit 578e1c4db2213 ("kvm: x86: Avoid taking MMU lock
in kvm_mmu_sync_roots if no sync is needed") added smp_wmb() in
mmu_try_to_unsync_pages(), but the corresponding smp_load_acquire() isn't
used on the load of SPTE.W.  smp_load_acquire() orders _subsequent_
loads after sp->is_unsync; it does not order _earlier_ loads before
the load of sp->is_unsync.

This has no functional change; smp_rmb() is a NOP on x86, and no
compiler barrier is required because there is a VMEXIT between the
load of SPTE.W and kvm_mmu_snc_roots.
