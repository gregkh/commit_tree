arm64: dts: qcom: apq8016-sbc: Clarify firmware-names

Commit 0f6b380d580c ("arm64: dts: qcom: apq8016-sbc: Update modem and WiFi
firmware path") added "firmware-name"s to the APQ8016 SBC (DB410c) device
tree to separate the (test key)-signed firmware from other devices.

However, the added names are a bit confusing. The "modem" firmware used by
DB410c is actually a simplified version for APQ8016 that lacks most of the
modem functionality (phone calls, SMS etc) that is available on MSM8916.
Placing it in "qcom/msm8916/modem.mbn" suggests that it supports all
functionality for MSM and not just the reduced functionality for APQ.

Request the firmware from "qcom/apq8016/modem.mbn" instead to clarify this.
Do the same for "wcnss.mbn" for consistency (although the WCNSS firmware
works just fine on MSM8916).

Finally, add a "_sbc" suffix to the WCNSS_qcom_wlan_nv.bin firmware file.
It seems like the nv.bin firmware is somewhat board specific and can
therefore vary a bit from device to device. This makes it more clear
which board it is intended to be used for.
