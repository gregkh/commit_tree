ethernet: tg3: remove direct netdev->dev_addr writes

tg3 does various forms of direct writes to netdev->dev_addr.
Use a local buffer. Make sure local buffer is aligned since
eth_platform_get_mac_address() may call ether_addr_copy().

tg3_get_device_address() returns whenever it finds a method
that found a valid address. Instead of modifying all the exit
points pass the buffer from the outside and commit the address
in the caller.

Constify the argument of the set addr helper.
