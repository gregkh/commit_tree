soc: samsung: exynos-chipid: convert to a module

Exynos ChipID and ASV (Adaptive Supply Voltage) driver is not essential
to system boot and it can successfully be built and loaded as module.

This makes core kernel image smaller and reduces the memory footprint
when multi-platform kernel is booted on non-Exynos board.  Usually it is
also distro-friendly.

Add multiple authors of the driver since its conversion from
mach-exynos, ordered alphabetically by first name.
