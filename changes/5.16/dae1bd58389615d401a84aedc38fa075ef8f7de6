x86/msr-index: Add MSRs for XFD

XFD introduces two MSRs:

    - IA32_XFD to enable/disable a feature controlled by XFD

    - IA32_XFD_ERR to expose to the #NM trap handler which feature
      was tried to be used for the first time.

Both use the same xstate-component bitmap format, used by XCR0.
