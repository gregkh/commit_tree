bpf: Fix extable address check.

The verifier checks that PTR_TO_BTF_ID pointer is either valid or NULL,
but it cannot distinguish IS_ERR pointer from valid one.

When offset is added to IS_ERR pointer it may become small positive
value which is a user address that is not handled by extable logic
and has to be checked for at the runtime.

Tighten BPF_PROBE_MEM pointer check code to prevent this case.

Fixes: 4c5de127598e ("bpf: Emit explicit NULL pointer checks for PROBE_LDX instructions.")
