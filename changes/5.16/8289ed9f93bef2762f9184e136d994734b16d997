btrfs: replace the BUG_ON in btrfs_del_root_ref with proper error handling

I hit the BUG_ON() with generic/475 test case, and to my surprise, all
callers of btrfs_del_root_ref() are already aborting transaction, thus
there is not need for such BUG_ON(), just go to @out label and caller
will properly handle the error.
