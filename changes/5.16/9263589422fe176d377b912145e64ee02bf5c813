scripts: get_abi.pl: Better handle leaves with wildcards

When the the leaf of a regex ends with a wildcard, the speedup
algorithm to reduce the number of regexes to seek won't work.

So, when those are found, place at the "others" exception.

That slows down the search from 0.14s to 1 minute on my
machine, but the results are a lot more consistent.
