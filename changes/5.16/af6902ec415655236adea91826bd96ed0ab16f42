drm/amd/display: Fix DPIA outbox timeout after S3/S4/reset

[Why]
The HW interrupt gets disabled after S3/S4/reset so we don't receive
notifications for HPD or AUX from DMUB - leading to timeout and
black screen with (or without) DPIA links connected.

[How]
Re-enable the interrupt after S3/S4/reset like we do for the other
DC interrupts.

Guard both instances of the outbox interrupt enable or we'll hang
during restore on ASIC that don't support it.
