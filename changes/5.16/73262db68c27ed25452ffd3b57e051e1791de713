drm/i915/display: Match PSR2 selective fetch sequences with specification

We were not completely following the selective fetch programming
sequence, here some things we were doing wrong:
- not programming plane selective fetch a PSR2_MAN_TRK_CTL registers
when doing a modeset
- programming PSR2_MAN_TRK_CTL out of vblank

With this changes the last remainig underrun found in Alderlake-P is
fixed.
