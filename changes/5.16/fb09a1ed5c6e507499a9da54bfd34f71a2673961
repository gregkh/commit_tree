qed: Remove e4_ and _e4 from FW HSI

The existing qed/qede/qedr/qedi/qedf code uses chip-specific naming in
structures,  functions, variables and defines in FW HSI (Hardware
Software Interface).

The new FW version introduced a generic naming convention in HSI
in-which the same code will be used across different versions
for simpler maintainability. It also eases in providing support for
new features.

With this patch every "_e4" or "e4_" prefix or suffix is not needed
anymore and it will be removed.
