KVM: SEV: do not use list_replace_init on an empty list

list_replace_init cannot be used if the source is an empty list,
because "new->next->prev = new" will overwrite "old->next":

				new				old
				prev = new, next = new		prev = old, next = old
new->next = old->next		prev = new, next = old		prev = old, next = old
new->next->prev = new		prev = new, next = old		prev = old, next = new
new->prev = old->prev		prev = old, next = old		prev = old, next = old
new->next->prev = new		prev = old, next = old		prev = new, next = new

The desired outcome instead would be to leave both old and new the same
as they were (two empty circular lists).  Use list_cut_before, which
already has the necessary check and is documented to discard the
previous contents of the list that will hold the result.
