swiotlb: Support aligned swiotlb buffers

Add an argument to swiotlb_tbl_map_single that specifies the desired
alignment of the allocated buffer. This is used by dma-iommu to ensure
the buffer is aligned to the iova granule size when using swiotlb with
untrusted sub-granule mappings. This addresses an issue where adjacent
slots could be exposed to the untrusted device if IO_TLB_SIZE < iova
granule < PAGE_SIZE.
