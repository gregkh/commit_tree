static_call,x86: Robustify trampoline patching

Add a few signature bytes after the static call trampoline and verify
those bytes match before patching the trampoline. This avoids patching
random other JMPs (such as CFI jump-table entries) instead.

These bytes decode as:

   d:   53                      push   %rbx
   e:   43 54                   rex.XB push %r12

And happen to spell "SCT".
