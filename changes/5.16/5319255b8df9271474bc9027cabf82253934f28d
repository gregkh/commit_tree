selftests/bpf: Skip verifier tests that fail to load with ENOTSUPP

The verifier tests added in commit c48e51c8b07a ("bpf: selftests: Add
selftests for module kfunc support") fail on s390, since the JIT does
not support calling kernel functions. This is most likely an issue for
all the other non-Intel arches, as well as on Intel with
!CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF or !CONFIG_BPF_JIT.

Trying to check for messages from all the possible add_kfunc_call()
failure cases in test_verifier looks pointless, so do a much simpler
thing instead: just like it's already done in do_prog_test_run(), skip
the tests that fail to load with ENOTSUPP.
