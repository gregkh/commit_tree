ASoC: topology: change the complete op in snd_soc_tplg_ops to return int

In the SOF driver, the operations performed in the complete callback
can fail and therefore topology loading should return an error in
such cases. So, change the signature of the complete op
in struct snd_soc_tplg_ops to return an int to return the error.

Also, amend the complete callback functions in the SOF driver and
the SKL driver to conform with the new signature.
