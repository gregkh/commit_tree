staging: r8188eu: Remove mp, a.k.a. manufacturing process, code

The standard driver contains code used by the factory to evaluate chips
that have just been manufactured. Such code is indicated by "mp" in
the variable names, the routine names, and in file names. All of these
can be deleted.

In addition to removing nearly 7,000 lines of code, the size of the driver
is reduced by 63 KB:
          text    data     bss     dec     hex
Before  573959   48582   14660  637201   9b911
After   513530   45894   14660  574084   8c284
