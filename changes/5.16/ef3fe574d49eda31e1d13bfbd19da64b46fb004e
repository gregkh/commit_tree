i2c: tegra: Ensure that device is suspended before driver is removed

Tegra I2C device isn't guaranteed to be suspended after removal of
the driver since driver uses pm_runtime_put() that is asynchronous and
pm_runtime_disable() cancels pending power-change requests. This means
that potentially refcount of the clocks may become unbalanced after
removal of the driver. This a very minor problem which unlikely to
happen in practice and won't cause any visible problems, nevertheless
let's replace pm_runtime_disable() with pm_runtime_force_suspend() and
use pm_runtime_put_sync() which disables RPM of the device and puts it
into suspend before driver is removed.
