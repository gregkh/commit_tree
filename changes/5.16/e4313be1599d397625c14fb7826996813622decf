PCI: aardvark: Fix return value of MSI domain .alloc() method

MSI domain callback .alloc() (implemented by advk_msi_irq_domain_alloc()
function) should return zero on success, since non-zero value indicates
failure.

When the driver was converted to generic MSI API in commit f21a8b1b6837
("PCI: aardvark: Move to MSI handling using generic MSI support"), it
was converted so that it returns hwirq number.

Fix this.
