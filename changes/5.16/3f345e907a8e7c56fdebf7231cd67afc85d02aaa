usb: typec: ucsi: Only check the contract if there is a connection

The driver must make sure there is an actual connection
before checking details about the USB Power Delivery
contract. Those details are not valid unless there is a
connection.

This fixes NULL pointer dereference that is caused by an
attempt to register bogus partner alternate mode that the
firmware on some platform may report before the actual
connection.
