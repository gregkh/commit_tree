KVM: x86/mmu: Drop a redundant remote TLB flush in kvm_zap_gfn_range()

Remove an unnecessary remote TLB flush in kvm_zap_gfn_range() now that
said function holds mmu_lock for write for its entire duration.  The
flush was added by the now-reverted commit to allow TDP MMU to flush while
holding mmu_lock for read, as the transition from write=>read required
dropping the lock and thus a pending flush needed to be serviced.
