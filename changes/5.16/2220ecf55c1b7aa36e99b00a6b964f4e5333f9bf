selftests/bpf: Skip btf_tag test if btf_tag attribute not supported

Commit c240ba287890 ("selftests/bpf: Add a test with a bpf
program with btf_tag attributes") added btf_tag selftest
to test BTF_KIND_TAG generation from C source code, and to
test kernel validation of generated BTF types.
But if an old clang (clang 13 or earlier) is used, the
following compiler warning may be seen:
  progs/tag.c:23:20: warning: unknown attribute 'btf_tag' ignored
and the test itself is marked OK. The compiler warning is bad
and the test itself shouldn't be marked OK.

This patch added the check for btf_tag attribute support.
If btf_tag is not supported by the clang, the attribute will
not be used in the code and the test will be marked as skipped.
For example, with clang 13:
  ./test_progs -t btf_tag
  #21 btf_tag:SKIP
  Summary: 1/0 PASSED, 1 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED

The selftests/README.rst is updated to clarify when the btf_tag
test may be skipped.
