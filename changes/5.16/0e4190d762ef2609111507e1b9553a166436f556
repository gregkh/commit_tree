hwmon: (sht4x) Fix EREMOTEIO errors

Per datasheet, SHT4x may need up to 8.2ms for a "high repeatability"
measurement to complete.  Attempting to read the result too early
triggers a NAK which then causes an EREMOTEIO error.

This behavior has been confirmed with a logic analyzer while running
the I2C bus at only 40kHz.  The low frequency precludes any
signal-integrity issues, which was also confirmed by the absence of
any CRC8 errors.  In this configuration, a NAK occurred on any read
that followed the measurement command within less than 8.2ms.
