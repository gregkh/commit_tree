memstick: jmb38x_ms: use appropriate free function in jmb38x_ms_alloc_host()

The "msh" pointer is device managed, meaning that memstick_alloc_host()
calls device_initialize() on it.  That means that it can't be free
using kfree() but must instead be freed with memstick_free_host().
Otherwise it leads to a tiny memory leak of device resources.
