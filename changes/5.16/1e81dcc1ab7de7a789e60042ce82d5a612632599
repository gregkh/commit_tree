igc: Do not enable crosstimestamping for i225-V models

It was reported that when PCIe PTM is enabled, some lockups could
be observed with some integrated i225-V models.

While the issue is investigated, we can disable crosstimestamp for
those models and see no loss of functionality, because those models
don't have any support for time synchronization.
