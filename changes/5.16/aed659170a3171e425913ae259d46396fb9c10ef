libbpf: Support multiple .rodata.* and .data.* BPF maps

Add support for having multiple .rodata and .data data sections ([0]).
.rodata/.data are supported like the usual, but now also
.rodata.<whatever> and .data.<whatever> are also supported. Each such
section will get its own backing BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY, just like
.rodata and .data.

Multiple .bss maps are not supported, as the whole '.bss' name is
confusing and might be deprecated soon, as well as user would need to
specify custom ELF section with SEC() attribute anyway, so might as well
stick to just .data.* and .rodata.* convention.

User-visible map name for such new maps is going to be just their ELF
section names.
