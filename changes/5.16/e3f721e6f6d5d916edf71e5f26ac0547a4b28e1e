io_uring: split iopoll loop

The main loop of io_do_iopoll() iterates and does ->iopoll() until it
meets a first completed request, then it continues from that position
and splices requests to pass them through io_iopoll_complete().

Split the loop in two for clearness, iopolling and reaping completed
requests from the list.
