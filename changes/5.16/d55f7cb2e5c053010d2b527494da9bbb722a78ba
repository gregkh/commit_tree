bcache: fix error info in register_bcache()

In register_bcache(), there are several cases we didn't set
correct error info (return value and/or error message):
- if kzalloc() fails, it needs to return ENOMEM and print
"cannot allocate memory";
- if register_cache() fails, it's better to propagate its
return value rather than using default EINVAL.
