scripts: get_abi.pl: don't skip what that ends with wildcards

The search algorithm used inside check_undefined_symbols
has an optimization: it seeks only whats that have the same
leave name. This helps not only to speedup the search, but
it also allows providing a hint about a partial match.

There's a drawback, however: when "what:" finishes with a
wildcard, the logic will skip the what, reporting it as
"not found".

Fix it by grouping the remaining cases altogether, and
disabing any hints for such cases.
