staging: most: dim2: use device release method

Commit 723de0f9171e ("staging: most: remove device from interface
structure") moved registration of driver-provided struct device to
the most subsystem. This updated dim2 driver as well.

However, struct device passed to register_device() becomes refcounted,
and must not be explicitly deallocated, but must provide release method
instead. Which is incompatible with managing it via devres.

This patch makes the device structure allocated without devres, adds
device release method, and moves device destruction there.
