devlink: expose get/put functions

Allow those who hold implicit reference on a devlink instance
to try to take a full ref on it. This will be used from netdev
code which has an implicit ref because of driver call ordering.

Note that after recent changes devlink_unregister() may happen
before netdev unregister, but devlink_free() should still happen
after, so we are safe to try, but we can't just refcount_inc()
and assume it's not zero.
