i40e: Fix incorrect netdev's real number of RX/TX queues

There was a wrong queues representation in sysfs during
driver's reinitialization in case of online cpus number is
less than combined queues. It was caused by stopped
NetworkManager, which is responsible for calling vsi_open
function during driver's initialization.
In specific situation (ex. 12 cpus online) there were 16 queues
in /sys/class/net/<iface>/queues. In case of modifying queues with
value higher, than number of online cpus, then it caused write
errors and other errors.
Add updating of sysfs's queues representation during driver
initialization.
