dt-bindings: net: Reintroduce PHY no lane swap binding

This binding was already documented in phy.txt, commit 252ae5330daa
("Documentation: devicetree: Add PHY no lane swap binding"), but got
accidently removed during YAML conversion in commit d8704342c109
("dt-bindings: net: Add a YAML schemas for the generic PHY options").

Note: 'enet-phy-lane-no-swap' and the absence of 'enet-phy-lane-swap' are
not identical, as the former one disable this feature, while the latter
one doesn't change anything.

Fixes: d8704342c109 ("dt-bindings: net: Add a YAML schemas for the generic PHY options")
