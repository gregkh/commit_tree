spi: cadence: fix static checker warning

This patch fixes Smatch static checker warning.
CDNS_XSPI_CMD_REG_5 is used in ACMD mode and currently
only STIG mode is enabled which doesn't use CDNS_XSPI_CMD_REG_5
and hence everything was working in STIG mode.
Since plan is to use same function cdns_xspi_trigger_command()
in ACMD mode, increasing size of the array passed to it.
