xfs: compute absolute maximum nlevels for each btree type

Add code for all five btree types so that we can compute the absolute
maximum possible btree height for each btree type.  This is a setup for
the next patch, which makes every btree type have its own cursor cache.

The functions are exported so that we can have xfs_db report the
absolute maximum btree heights for each btree type, rather than making
everyone run their own ad-hoc computations.
