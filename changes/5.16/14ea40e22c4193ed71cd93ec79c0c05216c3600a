s390/mm: optimize reset_guest_reference_bit()

We already optimize get_guest_storage_key() to assume that if we don't have
a PTE table and don't have a huge page mapped that the storage key is 0.

Similarly, optimize reset_guest_reference_bit() to simply do nothing if
there is no PTE table and no huge page mapped.
