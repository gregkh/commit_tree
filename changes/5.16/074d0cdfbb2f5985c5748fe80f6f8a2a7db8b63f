cpufreq: intel_pstate: Clear HWP Status during HWP Interrupt enable

It is possible that some performance excursions happened before OS boot
or enable HWP interrupts. So clear MSR_HWP_STATUS bits when we enable
HWP interrupt. In this way a next excursion will results in a HWP
interrupt.

The status bits of MSR_HWP_STATUS must be cleared (0) by software so
that a new status condition change will cause the hardware to set the
bit again and issue the notification.
