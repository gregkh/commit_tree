bus/fsl-mc: Add generic implementation for open/reset/close commands

The open/reset/close commands format is similar for all objects.
Currently there are multiple implementations for these commands
scattered through various drivers. The code is cavsi-identical.
Create a generic implementation for the open/reset/close commands.
One of the consumer will be the VFIO driver which needs to
be able to reset a device.
