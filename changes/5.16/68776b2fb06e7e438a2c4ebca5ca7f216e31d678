ASoC: SOF: dai-intel: add SOF_DAI_INTEL_SSP_CLKCTRL_MCLK/BCLK_ES bits

Add two clks_control bits. MCLK and/or BCLK will start during hw_params
and stop during hw_free if the corresponding bit is set.

While the kernel does not do anything with these bitfields, this is
also tagged as part of the ABI 3.19 changes.
