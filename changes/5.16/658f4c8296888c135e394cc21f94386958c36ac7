drm/msm/devfreq: Add 1ms delay before clamping freq

Add a short delay before clamping to idle frequency on active->idle
transition.  It takes ~0.5ms to increase the freq again on the next
idle->active transition, so this helps avoid extra freq transitions
on workloads that bounce between CPU and GPU.
