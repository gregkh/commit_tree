sched: Move kprobes cleanup out of finish_task_switch()

Doing cleanups in the tail of schedule() is a latency punishment for the
incoming task. The point of invoking kprobes_task_flush() for a dead task
is that the instances are returned and cannot leak when __schedule() is
kprobed.

Move it into the delayed cleanup.
