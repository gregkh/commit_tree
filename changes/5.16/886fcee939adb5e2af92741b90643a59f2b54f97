wireguard: receive: use ring buffer for incoming handshakes

Apparently the spinlock on incoming_handshake's skb_queue is highly
contended, and a torrent of handshake or cookie packets can bring the
data plane to its knees, simply by virtue of enqueueing the handshake
packets to be processed asynchronously. So, we try switching this to a
ring buffer to hopefully have less lock contention. This alleviates the
problem somewhat, though it still isn't perfect, so future patches will
have to improve this further. However, it at least doesn't completely
diminish the data plane.
