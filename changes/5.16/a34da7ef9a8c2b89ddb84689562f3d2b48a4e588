dmaengine: altera-msgdma: Correctly handle descriptor callbacks

DMA clients can provide one of two types of callbacks. For this reason
dmaengine drivers should not directly invoke `callback`, but always use
dmaengine_desc_callback_invoke(). This makes sure that both types of
callbacks are handled correctly.

The altera-msgdma driver currently doesn't do this and only handles the
`callback` type callback. If the client used the `callback_result` type
callback it will not be called.

Fix this by switching to `dmaengine_desc_callback_valid()` and
`dmaengine_desc_callback_invoke()`.
