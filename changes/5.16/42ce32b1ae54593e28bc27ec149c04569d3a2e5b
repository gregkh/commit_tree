staging: r8188eu: Remove unused macros and defines from odm.h

This header defines a number of symbols/macros that are not used and can
be removed. In addition, it defines a number of synonym symbols that are
used interchangeably in the source. Only one is now selected.

In addition to the above, a number of comments that have no meaning for
this chip have been removed.
