KVM: selftests: Require GPA to be aligned when backed by hugepages

Assert that the GPA for a memslot backed by a hugepage is aligned to
the hugepage size and fix perf_test_util accordingly.  Lack of GPA
alignment prevents KVM from backing the guest with hugepages, e.g. x86's
write-protection of hugepages when dirty logging is activated is
otherwise not exercised.

Add a comment explaining that guest_page_size is for non-huge pages to
try and avoid confusion about what it actually tracks.
