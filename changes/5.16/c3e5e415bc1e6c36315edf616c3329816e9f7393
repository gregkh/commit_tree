KVM: X86: Change kvm_sync_page() to return true when remote flush is needed

Currently kvm_sync_page() returns true when there is any present spte.
But the return value is ignored in the callers.

Changing kvm_sync_page() to return true when remote flush is needed and
changing mmu->sync_page() not to directly flush can combine and reduce
remote flush requests.
