tools/vm/page_owner_sort.c: count and sort by mem

When viewing page owner information, we may be more concerned about the
total memory rather than the times of stack appears.  Therefore, the
following adjustments are made:

1. Added the statistics on the total number of pages.

2. Added the optional parameter "-m" to configure the program to sort by
   memory (total pages).

The general output of page_owner is as follows:

	Page allocated via order XXX, ...
	PFN XXX ...
	 // Detailed stack

	Page allocated via order XXX, ...
	PFN XXX ...
	 // Detailed stack

The original page_owner_sort ignores PFN rows, puts the remaining rows
in buf, counts the times of buf, and finally sorts them according to the
times.  General output:

	XXX times:
	Page allocated via order XXX, ...
	 // Detailed stack

Now, we use regexp to extract the page order value from the buf, and
count the total pages for the buf.  General output:

	XXX times, XXX pages:
	Page allocated via order XXX, ...
	 // Detailed stack

By default, it is still sorted by the times of buf; If you want to sort
by the pages nums of buf, use the new -m parameter.
