scftorture: Warn on individual scf_torture_init() error conditions

When running scftorture as a module, any scf_torture_init() issues will be
reflected in the error code from modprobe or insmod, as the case may be.
However, these error codes are not available when running scftorture
built-in, for example, when using the kvm.sh script.  This commit
therefore adds WARN_ON_ONCE() to allow distinguishing scf_torture_init()
errors when running scftorture built-in.
