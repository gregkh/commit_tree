sched: Provide Kconfig support for default dynamic preempt mode

Currently the boot defined preempt behaviour (aka dynamic preempt)
selects full preemption by default when the "preempt=" boot parameter
is omitted. However distros may rather want to default to either
no preemption or voluntary preemption.

To provide with this flexibility, make dynamic preemption a visible
Kconfig option and adapt the preemption behaviour selected by the user
to either static or dynamic preemption.
