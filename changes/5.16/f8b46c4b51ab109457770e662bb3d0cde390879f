arm64/mm: Add pud_sect_supported()

Section mapping at PUD level is supported only on 4K pages and currently it
gets verified with explicit #ifdef or IS_ENABLED() constructs. This adds a
new helper pud_sect_supported() for this purpose, which particularly cleans
up the HugeTLB code path. It updates relevant switch statements with checks
for __PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED in order to avoid build failures caused with two
identical switch case values in those code blocks.
