mm/lru: Add folio LRU functions

Handle arbitrary-order folios being added to the LRU.  By definition,
all pages being added to the LRU were already head or base pages, but
call page_folio() on them anyway to get the type right and avoid the
buried calls to compound_head().

Saves 783 bytes of kernel text; no functions grow.
