PCI: kirin: Add support for a PHY layer

The pcie-kirin driver contains both PHY and generic PCI driver.

The best would be, instead, to support a PCI PHY driver, making the driver
more generic.

However, it is too late to remove the Kirin 960 PHY, as a change like that
would make the DT schema incompatible with past versions.

So, add support for an external PHY driver without removing the existing
Kirin 960 PHY from it.
