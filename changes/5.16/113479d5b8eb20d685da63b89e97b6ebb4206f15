btrfs: rename root fields in delayed refs structs

Both data and metadata delayed ref structures have fields named
root/ref_root respectively. Those are somewhat cryptic and don't really
convey the real meaning. In fact those roots are really the original
owners of the respective block (i.e in case of a snapshot a data delayed
ref will contain the original root that owns the given block). Rename
those fields accordingly and adjust comments.
