net/qla3xxx: fix an error code in ql_adapter_up()

The ql_wait_for_drvr_lock() fails and returns false, then this
function should return an error code instead of returning success.

The other problem is that the success path prints an error message
netdev_err(ndev, "Releasing driver lock\n");  Delete that and
re-order the code a little to make it more clear.
