staging: wfx: use abbreviated message for "incorrect sequence"

The wfx driver checks carefully the coherency of of the DTIM
notifications. We have noticed several times some small inconsistencies
from the firmware on these notification. They have never been critical.

However on the driver side they lead to big fat warnings. Worse, if
these warning are displayed on UART console, they can be long to display
(several hundreds of millisecs). Since, this warning is generated from a
work queue, it can delay all the workqueue users. Especially, it can
drastically slow down the frame management of the driver and then
generate errors that are serious this time (eg. an overflow of the
indication queue of the device).
