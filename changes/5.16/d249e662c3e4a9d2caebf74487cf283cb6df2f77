mxser: store FCR state in mxser_port::FCR

We force the FCR contents on many places in the code instead of writing
what was actually set in mxser_change_speed() (by ->activate() or
->set_serial_info()).

So introduce mxser_port::FCR to hold the proper contents and bitwise-OR
the value to what needs to be set on all those locations. That is,
clearing RX and/or TX FIFOs. Those flags are self-clearing, so no need
to set them to mxser_port::FCR.
