scsi: ufs: ufshpb: Use proper power management API

In ufshpb, pm_runtime_{get,put}_sync() are used to avoid unwanted runtime
suspend during query requests. Whereas commit b294ff3e3449 ("scsi: ufs:
core: Enable power management for wlun") modified the driver core to use
ufshcd_rpm_{get,put}_sync() APIs.

Switch to these APIs in HPB module as well.
