USB: serial: cp210x: fix CP2105 GPIO registration

When generalising GPIO support and adding support for CP2102N, the GPIO
registration for some CP2105 devices accidentally broke. Specifically,
when all the pins of a port are in "modem" mode, and thus unavailable
for GPIO use, the GPIO chip would now be registered without having
initialised the number of GPIO lines. This would in turn be rejected by
gpiolib and some errors messages would be printed (but importantly probe
would still succeed).

Fix this by initialising the number of GPIO lines before registering the
GPIO chip.

Note that as for the other device types, and as when all CP2105 pins are
muxed for LED function, the GPIO chip is registered also when no pins
are available for GPIO use.
