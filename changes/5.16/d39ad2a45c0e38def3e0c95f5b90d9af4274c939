nvme: disable namespace access for unsupported metadata

The only fabrics target that supports metadata handling through the
separate integrity buffer is RDMA. It is currently usable only if the
size is 8B per block and formatted for protection information. If an
rdma target were to export a namespace with a different format (ex:
4k+64B), the driver will not be able to submit valid read/write commands
for that namespace.

Suppress setting the metadata feature in the namespace so that the
gendisk capacity will be set to 0. This will prevent read/write access
through the block stack, but will continue to allow ioctl passthrough
commands.
