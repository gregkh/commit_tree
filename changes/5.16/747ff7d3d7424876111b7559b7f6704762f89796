ath10k: Don't always treat modem stop events as crashes

When rebooting on sc7180 Trogdor devices I see the following crash from
the wifi driver.

 ath10k_snoc 18800000.wifi: firmware crashed! (guid 83493570-29a2-4e98-a83e-70048c47669c)

This is because a modem stop event looks just like a firmware crash to
the driver, the qmi connection is closed in both cases. Use the qcom ssr
notifier block to stop treating the qmi connection close event as a
firmware crash signal when the modem hasn't actually crashed. See
ath10k_qmi_event_server_exit() for more details.

This silences the crash message seen during every reboot.
