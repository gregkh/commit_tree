scripts/spelling.txt: fix "mistake" version of "synchronization"

If both "mistake" version and "correction" version are the same, a
warning message is created by checkpatch which is impossible to fix.
But it was noticed that Colan Ian King created a commit e6c0a0889b80
("ALSA: aloop: Fix spelling mistake "synchronization" ->
"synchronization"") which suggests that this spelling mistake was fixed
by replacing the word "synchronization" with itself.  But the actual
diff shows that the mistake in the code was "sychronization".  It is
rather likely that the "mistake" in spelling.txt should have been the
latter.
