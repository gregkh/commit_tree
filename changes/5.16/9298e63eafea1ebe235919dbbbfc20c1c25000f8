bpf/tests: Add exhaustive tests of ALU operand magnitudes

This patch adds a set of tests for ALU64 and ALU32 arithmetic and bitwise
logical operations to verify correctness for all possible magnitudes of
the register and immediate operands. Mainly intended for JIT testing.

The patch introduces a pattern generator that can be used to drive
extensive tests of different kinds of operations. It is parameterized
to allow tuning of the operand combinations to test.
