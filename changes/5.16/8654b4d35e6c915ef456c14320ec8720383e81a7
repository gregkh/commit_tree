bpftool: Support multiple .rodata/.data internal maps in skeleton

Remove the assumption about only single instance of each of .rodata and
.data internal maps. Nothing changes for '.rodata' and '.data' maps, but new
'.rodata.something' map will get 'rodata_something' section in BPF
skeleton for them (as well as having struct bpf_map * field in maps
section with the same field name).
