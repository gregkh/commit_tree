tools/lib/lockdep: drop leftover liblockdep headers

Clean up remaining headers that are specific to liblockdep but lived in
the shared header directory.  These are all unused after the liblockdep
code was removed in commit 7246f4dcaccc ("tools/lib/lockdep: drop
liblockdep").

Note that there are still headers that were originally created for
liblockdep, that still have liblockdep references, but they are used by
other tools/ code at this point.
