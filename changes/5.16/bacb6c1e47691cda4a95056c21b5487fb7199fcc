net/smc: Don't call clcsock shutdown twice when smc shutdown

When applications call shutdown() with SHUT_RDWR in userspace,
smc_close_active() calls kernel_sock_shutdown(), and it is called
twice in smc_shutdown().

This fixes this by checking sk_state before do clcsock shutdown, and
avoids missing the application's call of smc_shutdown().
