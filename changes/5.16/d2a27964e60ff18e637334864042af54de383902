block: Rename BLKDEV_MAX_RQ -> BLKDEV_DEFAULT_RQ

It is a bit confusing that there is BLKDEV_MAX_RQ and MAX_SCHED_RQ, as
the name BLKDEV_MAX_RQ would imply the max requests always, which it is
not.

Rename to BLKDEV_MAX_RQ to BLKDEV_DEFAULT_RQ, matching its usage - that being
the default number of requests assigned when allocating a request queue.
