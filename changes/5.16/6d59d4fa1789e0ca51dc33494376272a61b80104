ptp: ocp: Have FPGA fold in ns adjustment for adjtime.

The current implementation of adjtime uses gettime/settime to
perform nanosecond adjustments.  This introduces addtional phase
errors due to delays.

Instead, use the FPGA's ability to just apply the nanosecond
adjustment to the clock directly.
