drm/aspeed: Fix vga_pw sysfs output

Before the drm driver had support for this file there was a driver that
exposed the contents of the vga password register to userspace. It would
present the entire register instead of interpreting it.

The drm implementation chose to mask of the lower bit, without explaining
why. This breaks the existing userspace, which is looking for 0xa8 in
the lower byte.

Change our implementation to expose the entire register.
