drm/nouveau/mmu: drop unneeded assignment in the nvkm_uvmm_mthd_page()

In order to keep the code style consistency of the whole file,
the 'ret' assignments should be deleted.

The clang_analyzer complains as follows:

drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/mmu/uvmm.c:317:8:warning:
Although the value storedto 'ret' is used in the enclosing expression,
the value is never actually read from 'ret'.
