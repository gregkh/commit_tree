memblock: improve MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG documentation

The description of MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG is currently short and consequently
misleading: we're actually dealing with a memory region that might get
hotunplugged later (i.e., the platform+firmware supports it), yet it is
indicated in the firmware-provided memory map as system ram that will
just get used by the system for any purpose when not taking special
care.  The firmware marked this memory region as a hot(un)plugged (e.g.,
hotplugged before reboot), implying that it might get hotunplugged again
later.

Whether we consider this information depends on the "movable_node"
kernel commandline parameter: only with "movable_node" set, we'll try
keeping this memory hotunpluggable, for example, by not serving early
allocations from this memory region and by letting the buddy manage it
using the ZONE_MOVABLE.

Let's make this clearer by extending the documentation.

Note: kexec *has to* indicate this memory to the second kernel.  With
"movable_node" set, we don't want to place kexec-images on this memory.
Without "movable_node" set, we don't care and can place kexec-images on
this memory.  In both cases, after successful memory hotunplug, kexec
has to be re-armed to update the memory map for the second kernel and to
place the kexec-images somewhere else.
