USB: chipidea: fix interrupt deadlock

Chipidea core was calling the interrupt handler from non-IRQ context
with interrupts enabled, something which can lead to a deadlock if
there's an actual interrupt trying to take a lock that's already held
(e.g. the controller lock in udc_irq()).

Add a wrapper that can be used to fake interrupts instead of calling the
handler directly.
