ARM: dts: qcom: msm8916-samsung-serranove: Include dts from arm64

After adding all necessary support for MSM8916 SMP/cpuidle without PSCI
on ARM32, build the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini VE device tree from the arm64
tree together with the ARM32 include to allow booting this device on ARM32.

The approach to include device tree files from other architectures is
inspired from e.g. the Raspberry Pi (bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts) where this is
used to build the device tree for both ARM32 and ARM64.
