drm/panel: support for BOE and INX video mode panel

Support for these two panels fits in nicely with the existing
panel-boe-tv101wum-nl6 driver as suggested by Sam [1].
This is an incell IC, TDDI use time division multiplexing.
Init code effect touch sensing.The main things
we needed to handle were:
a) These panels need slightly longer delays in two places. Since these
new delays aren't much longer, let's just unconditionally increase
them for the driver.
b) These panel use video BURST mode
