mm/memcg: Convert mem_cgroup_track_foreign_dirty_slowpath() to folio

The page was only being used for the memcg and to gather trace
information, so this is a simple conversion.  The only caller of
mem_cgroup_track_foreign_dirty() will be converted to folios in a later
patch, so doing this now makes that patch simpler.
