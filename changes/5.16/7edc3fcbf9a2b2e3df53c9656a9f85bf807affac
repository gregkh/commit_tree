selftest/bpf: Add a test that reads various addresses.

Add a function to bpf_testmod that returns invalid kernel and user addresses.
Then attach an fexit program to that function that tries to read
memory through these addresses.

This logic checks that bpf_probe_read_kernel and BPF_PROBE_MEM logic is sane.
