i40e: Fix to not show opcode msg on unsuccessful VF MAC change

Hide i40e opcode information sent during response to VF in case when
untrusted VF tried to change MAC on the VF interface.

This is implemented by adding an additional parameter 'hide' to the
response sent to VF function that hides the display of error
information, but forwards the error code to VF.

Previously it was not possible to send response with some error code
to VF without displaying opcode information.
