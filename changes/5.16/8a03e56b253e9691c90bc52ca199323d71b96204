bpf: Disallow unprivileged bpf by default

Disabling unprivileged BPF would help prevent unprivileged users from
creating certain conditions required for potential speculative execution
side-channel attacks on unmitigated affected hardware.

A deep dive on such attacks and current mitigations is available here [0].

Sync with what many distros are currently applying already, and disable
unprivileged BPF by default. An admin can enable this at runtime, if
necessary, as described in 08389d888287 ("bpf: Add kconfig knob for
disabling unpriv bpf by default").
