ice: Add infrastructure for mqprio support via ndo_setup_tc

Add infrastructure required for "ndo_setup_tc:qdisc_mqprio".
ice_vsi_setup is modified to configure traffic classes based
on mqprio data received from the stack. This includes low-level
functions to configure min, max rate-limit parameters in hardware
for traffic classes. Each traffic class gets mapped to a hardware
channel (VSI) which can be individually configured with different
bandwidth parameters.
