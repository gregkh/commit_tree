serial: stm32: update throttle and unthrottle ops for dma mode

Disable DMA request line (if enabled) to switch in PIO mode in throttle
ops, so the RX data gets queues into the FIFO. The hardware flow control
is triggered when the RX FIFO is full.

Switch back to DMA mode (re-enable DMA request line) in unthrottle ops.
Hardware flow control is stopped when FIFO is not full anymore.
