net: sched: remove one pair of atomic operations

__QDISC_STATE_RUNNING is only set/cleared from contexts owning qdisc lock.

Thus we can use less expensive bit operations, as we were doing
before commit f9eb8aea2a1e ("net_sched: transform qdisc running bit into a seqcount")

Fixes: 29cbcd858283 ("net: sched: Remove Qdisc::running sequence counter")
