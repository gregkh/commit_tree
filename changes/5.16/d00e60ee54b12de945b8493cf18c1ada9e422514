page_pool: disable dma mapping support for 32-bit arch with 64-bit DMA

As the 32-bit arch with 64-bit DMA seems to rare those days,
and page pool might carry a lot of code and complexity for
systems that possibly.

So disable dma mapping support for such systems, if drivers
really want to work on such systems, they have to implement
their own DMA-mapping fallback tracking outside page_pool.
