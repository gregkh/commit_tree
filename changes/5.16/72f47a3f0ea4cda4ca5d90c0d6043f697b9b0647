clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Fix MMIO base address vs callback ordering issue

The MMIO timer base address gets published after we have registered
the callbacks and the interrupt handler, which is... a bit dangerous.

Fix this by moving the base address publication to the point where
we register the timer, and expose a pointer to the timer structure
itself rather than a naked value.
