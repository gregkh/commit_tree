vfio/iommu_type1: initialize pgsize_bitmap in ->open

Ensure pgsize_bitmap is always valid by initializing it to PAGE_MASK
in vfio_iommu_type1_open and remove the now pointless update for
the external domain case in vfio_iommu_type1_attach_group, which was
just setting pgsize_bitmap to PAGE_MASK when only external domains
were attached.
