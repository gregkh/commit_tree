NFSD: Have legacy NFSD WRITE decoders use xdr_stream_subsegment()

Refactor.

Now that the NFSv2 and NFSv3 XDR decoders have been converted to
use xdr_streams, the WRITE decoder functions can use
xdr_stream_subsegment() to extract the WRITE payload into its own
xdr_buf, just as the NFSv4 WRITE XDR decoder currently does.

That makes it possible to pass the first kvec, pages array + length,
page_base, and total payload length via a single function parameter.

The payload's page_base is not yet assigned or used, but will be in
subsequent patches.
