selftests: net: dsa: add a stress test for unlocked FDB operations

This test is a bit strange in that it is perhaps more manual than
others: it does not transmit a clear OK/FAIL verdict, because user space
does not have synchronous feedback from the kernel. If a hardware access
fails, it is in deferred context.

Nonetheless, on sja1105 I have used it successfully to find and solve a
concurrency issue, so it can be used as a starting point for other
driver maintainers too.
