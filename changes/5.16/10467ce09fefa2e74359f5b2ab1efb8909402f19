RDMA/irdma: Don't arm the CQ more than two times if no CE for this CQ

Completion events (CEs) are lost if the application is allowed to arm the
CQ more than two times when no new CE for this CQ has been generated by
the HW.

Check if arming has been done for the CQ and if not, arm the CQ for any
event otherwise promote to arm the CQ for any event only when the last arm
event was solicited.
