mm/damon/schemes: prioritize regions within the quotas

This makes DAMON apply schemes to regions having higher priority first,
if it cannot apply schemes to all regions due to the quotas.

The prioritization function should be implemented in the monitoring
primitives.  Those would commonly calculate the priority of the region
using attributes of regions, namely 'size', 'nr_accesses', and 'age'.
For example, some primitive would calculate the priority of each region
using a weighted sum of 'nr_accesses' and 'age' of the region.

The optimal weights would depend on give environments, so this makes
those customizable.  Nevertheless, the score calculation functions are
only encouraged to respect the weights, not mandated.
