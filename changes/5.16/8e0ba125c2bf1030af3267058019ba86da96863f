parisc/unwind: fix unwinder when CONFIG_64BIT is enabled

With 64 bit kernels unwind_special() is not working because
it compares the pc to the address of the function descriptor.
Add a helper function that compares pc with the dereferenced
address. This fixes all of the backtraces on my c8000. Without
this changes, a lot of backtraces are missing in kdb or the
show-all-tasks command from /proc/sysrq-trigger.
