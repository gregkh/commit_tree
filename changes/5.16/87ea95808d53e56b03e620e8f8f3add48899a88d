drm/bridge: Add a function to abstract away panels

Display drivers so far need to have a lot of boilerplate to first
retrieve either the panel or bridge that they are connected to using
drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge(), and then either deal with each with ad-hoc
functions or create a drm panel bridge through drm_panel_bridge_add.

In order to reduce the boilerplate and hopefully create a path of least
resistance towards using the DRM panel bridge layer, let's create the
function devm_drm_of_get_bridge() to reduce that boilerplate.
