crypto: api - Do not create test larvals if manager is disabled

The delayed boot-time testing patch created a dependency loop
between api.c and algapi.c because it added a crypto_alg_tested
call to the former when the crypto manager is disabled.

We could instead avoid creating the test larvals if the crypto
manager is disabled.  This avoids the dependency loop as well
as saving some unnecessary work, albeit in a very unlikely case.
