RDMA/irdma: optimize rx path by removing unnecessary copy

In the function irdma_post_recv, the function irdma_copy_sg_list is
not needed since the struct irdma_sge and ib_sge have the similar
member variables. The struct irdma_sge can be replaced with the
struct ib_sge totally.

This can increase the rx performance of irdma.
