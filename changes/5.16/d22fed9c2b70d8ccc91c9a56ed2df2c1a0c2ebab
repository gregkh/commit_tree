cxl/pci: Remove dev_dbg for unknown register blocks

While interesting to driver developers, the dev_dbg message doesn't do
much except clutter up logs. This information should be attainable
through sysfs, and someday lspci like utilities. This change
additionally helps reduce the LOC in a subsequent patch to refactor some
of cxl_pci register mapping.
