arm64: add CPU field to struct thread_info

The CPU field will be moved back into thread_info even when
THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is enabled, so add it back to arm64's definition of
struct thread_info.

Note that arm64 always has CONFIG_SMP=y so there is no point in guarding
the CPU field with an #ifdef.
