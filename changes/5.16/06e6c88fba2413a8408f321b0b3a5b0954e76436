ipv6: enable net.ipv6.route.max_size sysctl in network namespace

We want to increase route cache size in network namespace
created with user namespace. Currently ipv6 route settings
are disabled for non-initial network namespaces.
We can allow this sysctl and it will be safe since
commit <6126891c6d4f> because route cache account to kmem,
that is why users from user namespace can not DOS system.
