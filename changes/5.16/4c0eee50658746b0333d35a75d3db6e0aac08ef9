dmaengine: sh: make array ds_lut static

Don't populate the read-only array ds_lut on the stack but instead it
static. Also makes the object code smaller by 163 bytes:

Before:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  23508    4796       0   28304    6e90 ./drivers/dma/sh/rz-dmac.o

After:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  23281    4860       0   28141    6ded ./drivers/dma/sh/rz-dmac.o

(gcc version 11.2.0)
