ptrace: Remove the unnecessary arguments from arch_ptrace_stop

Both arch_ptrace_stop_needed and arch_ptrace_stop are called with an
exit_code and a siginfo structure.  Neither argument is used by any of
the implementations so just remove the unneeded arguments.

The two arechitectures that implement arch_ptrace_stop are ia64 and
sparc.  Both architectures flush their register stacks before a
ptrace_stack so that all of the register information can be accessed
by debuggers.

As the question of if a register stack needs to be flushed is
independent of why ptrace is stopping not needing arguments make sense.
