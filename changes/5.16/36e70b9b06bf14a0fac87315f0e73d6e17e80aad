selftests, bpf: Fix broken riscv build

This patch is closely related to commit 6016df8fe874 ("selftests/bpf:
Fix broken riscv build"). When clang includes the system include
directories, but targeting BPF program, __BITS_PER_LONG defaults to
32, unless explicitly set. Work around this problem, by explicitly
setting __BITS_PER_LONG to __riscv_xlen.
