media: venus: vdec: decoded picture buffer handling during reconfig sequence

In existing implementation, driver is freeing and un-mapping all the
decoded picture buffers(DPB) as part of dynamic resolution change(DRC)
handling. As a result, when firmware try to access the DPB buffer, from
previous sequence, SMMU context fault is seen due to the buffer being
already unmapped.

With this change, driver defines ownership of each DPB buffer. If a buffer
is owned by firmware, driver would skip from un-mapping the same.
