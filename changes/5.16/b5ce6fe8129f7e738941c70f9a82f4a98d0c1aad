drm/amd/display: add missing ABM register offsets

[Why]
Some ABM registers don't exist on DCN 3.01, so are
missing from its register offset list. However,
this list was copied to later versions of DCN that
do have these registers. As a result, they're
inaccessible from the driver on those DCN versions
even though they exist.

[How]
Add the missing ABM register offsets to DCN 3.02+
