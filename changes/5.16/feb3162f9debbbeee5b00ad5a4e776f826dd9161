KVM: nVMX: Reset vmxon_ptr upon VMXOFF emulation.

Currently, 'vmx->nested.vmxon_ptr' is not reset upon VMXOFF
emulation. This is not a problem per se as we never access
it when !vmx->nested.vmxon. But this should be done to avoid
any issue in the future.

Also, initialize the vmxon_ptr when vcpu is created.
