ASoC: SOF: pipelines: Harmonize all functions to use struct snd_sof_dev

First thing the pipelines function which have "struct device *dev" as
parameter do is:
struct snd_sof_dev *sdev = dev_get_drvdata(dev);

and in all cases the passed dev is actually coming from sdev->dev.

Skip this steps and pass directly the sdev to all pipelines related
functions as few of them already does this.
