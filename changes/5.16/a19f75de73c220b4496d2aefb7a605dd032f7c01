Revert "i2c: core: support bus regulator controlling in adapter"

This largely reverts commit 5a7b95fb993ec399c8a685552aa6a8fc995c40bd. It
breaks suspend with AMD GPUs, and we couldn't incrementally fix it. So,
let's remove the code and go back to the drawing board. We keep the
header extension to not break drivers already populating the regulator.
We expect to re-add the code handling it soon.
