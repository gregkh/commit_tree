drm/v3d: Use scheduler dependency handling

With the prep work out of the way this isn't tricky anymore.

Aside: The chaining of the various jobs is a bit awkward, with the
possibility of failure in bad places. I think with the
drm_sched_job_init/arm split and maybe preloading the
job->dependencies xarray this should be fixable.

v2: Rebase over renamed function names for adding dependencies.
