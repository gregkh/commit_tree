drm/amd/display: update conditions to do dfp cap ext validation

[why]
According to DP specs dfp cap ext validation is only for branch
device withou 128b/132b channel coding support and
downstream of the branch device doesn't have compression.
Therefore we are adding conditions to only do dfp cap
extension validation for branch devcie supporting 8b/10b
channel coding only and it has no DSC passthrough capability.
