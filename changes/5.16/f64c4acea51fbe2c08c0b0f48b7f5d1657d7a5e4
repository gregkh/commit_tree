bpf: Add hardware timestamp field to __sk_buff

BPF programs may want to know hardware timestamps if NIC supports
such timestamping.

Expose this data as hwtstamp field of __sk_buff the same way as
gso_segs/gso_size. This field could be accessed from the same
programs as tstamp field, but it's read-only field. Explicit test
to deny access to padding data is added to bpf_skb_is_valid_access.

Also update BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN tests of the feature.
