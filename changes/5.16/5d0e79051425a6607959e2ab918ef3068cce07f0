arm64: extable: use `ex` for `exception_table_entry`

Subsequent patches will extend `struct exception_table_entry` with more
fields, and the distinction between the entry and its `fixup` field will
become more important.

For clarity, let's consistently use `ex` to refer to refer to an entire
entry. In subsequent patches we'll use `fixup` to refer to the fixup
field specifically. This matches the naming convention used today in
arch/arm64/net/bpf_jit_comp.c.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
