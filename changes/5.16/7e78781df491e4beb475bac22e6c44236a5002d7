drm/virtgpu api: define a dummy fence signaled event

The current virtgpu implementation of poll(..) drops events
when VIRTGPU_CONTEXT_PARAM_POLL_RINGS_MASK is enabled (otherwise
it's like a normal DRM driver).

This is because paravirtualized userspaces receives responses in a
buffer of type BLOB_MEM_GUEST, not by read(..).

To be in line with other DRM drivers and avoid specialized behavior,
it is possible to define a dummy event for virtgpu.  Paravirtualized
userspace will now have to call read(..) on the DRM fd to receive the
dummy event.
