platform/x86: think-lmi: Abort probe on analyze failure

A Lenovo ThinkStation S20 (4157CTO BIOS 60KT41AUS) fails to boot on
recent kernels including the think-lmi driver, due to the fact that
errors returned by the tlmi_analyze() function are ignored by
tlmi_probe(), where  tlmi_sysfs_init() is called unconditionally.
This results in making use of an array of already freed, non-null
pointers and other uninitialized globals, causing all sorts of nasty
kobject and memory faults.

Make use of the analyze function return value, free a couple leaked
allocations, and remove the settings_count field, which is incremented
but never consumed.
