scsi: ufs: core: Add temperature notification exception handling

The device may notify the host of an extreme temperature by using the
exception event mechanism. The exception can be raised when the deviceâ€™s
Tcase temperature is either too high or too low.

It is essentially up to the platform to decide what further actions need to
be taken. leave a placeholder for a designated vop for that.
