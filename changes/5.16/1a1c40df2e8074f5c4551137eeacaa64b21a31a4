ice: set and release switchdev environment

Switchdev environment has to be set up when user create VFs
and eswitch mode is switchdev. Release is done when user
delete all VFs.

Data path in this implementation is based on control plane VSI.
This VSI is used to pass traffic from port representors to
corresponding VFs and vice versa. Default TX rule has to be
added to forward packet to control plane VSI. This will redirect
packets from VFs which don't match other rules to control plane
VSI.

On RX side default rule is added on uplink VSI to receive all
traffic that doesn't match other rules. When setting switchdev
environment all other rules from VFs should be removed. Packet to
VFs will be forwarded by control plane VSI.

As VF without any mac rules can't send any packet because of
antispoof mechanism, VSI antispoof should be turned off on each VFs.

To send packet from representor to correct VSI, destination VSI
field in TX descriptor will have to be filled. Allow that by
setting destination override bit in control plane VSI security config.

Packet from VFs will be received on control plane VSI. Driver
should decide to which netdev forward the packet. Decision is
made based on src_vsi field from descriptor. There is a target
netdev list in control plane VSI struct which choose netdev
based on src_vsi number.
