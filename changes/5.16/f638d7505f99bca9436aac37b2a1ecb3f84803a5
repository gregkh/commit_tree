drm/amd/display: Fix deadlock when falling back to v2 from v3

[Why]
A deadlock in the kernel occurs when we fallback from the V3 to V2
add_topology_to_display or remove_topology_to_display because they
both try to acquire the dtm_mutex but recursive locking isn't
supported on mutex_lock().

[How]
Make the mutex_lock/unlock more fine grained and move them up such that
they're only required for the psp invocation itself.
