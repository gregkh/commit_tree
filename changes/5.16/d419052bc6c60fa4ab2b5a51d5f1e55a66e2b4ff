PCI: aardvark: Fix preserving PCI_EXP_RTCTL_CRSSVE flag on emulated bridge

Commit 43f5c77bcbd2 ("PCI: aardvark: Fix reporting CRS value") started
using CRSSVE flag for handling CRS responses.

PCI_EXP_RTCTL_CRSSVE flag is stored only in emulated config space buffer
and there is handler for PCI_EXP_RTCTL register. So every read operation
from config space automatically clears CRSSVE flag as it is not defined in
PCI_EXP_RTCTL read handler.

Fix this by reading current CRSSVE bit flag from emulated space buffer and
appending it to PCI_EXP_RTCTL read response.
