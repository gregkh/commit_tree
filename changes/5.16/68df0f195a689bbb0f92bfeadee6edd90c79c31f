drm/amdkfd: Separate pinned BOs destruction from general routine

Currently, all kfd BOs use same destruction routine. But pinned
BOs are not unpinned properly. Separate them from general routine.

v2 (Felix):
Add safeguard to prevent user space from freeing signal BO.
Kunmap signal BO in the event of setting event page error.
Just kunmap signal BO to avoid duplicating the code.
