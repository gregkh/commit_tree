KVM: selftests: Assert mmap HVA is aligned when using HugeTLB

Manually padding and aligning the mmap region is only needed when using
THP. When using HugeTLB, mmap will always return an address aligned to
the HugeTLB page size. Add a comment to clarify this and assert the mmap
behavior for HugeTLB.

[Removed requirement that HugeTLB mmaps must be padded per Yanan's
 feedback and added assertion that mmap returns aligned addresses
 when using HugeTLB.]
