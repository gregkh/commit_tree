nfp: fix potential deadlock when canceling dim work

When port is linked down, the process which has acquired rtnl_lock
will wait for the in-progress dim work to finish, and the work also
acquires rtnl_lock, which may cause deadlock.

Currently IRQ_MOD registers can be configured by `ethtool -C` and
dim work, and which will take effect depends on the execution order,
rtnl_lock is useless here, so remove them.
