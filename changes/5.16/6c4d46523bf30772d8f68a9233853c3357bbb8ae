drm/i915: Pimp link training debug prints

Unify all debug prints during link training to include information
on both the encoder and the LTTPR. We unify the format to something
like "[ENCODER:1:FOO][LTTPR 1] Something something". Though not
sure if those brackets around the dp_phy just make it look like
line noise? I'll accept suggestions on better formatting.

I'm slightly on the fence about also including the connector,
but technically only the DPRX is the SST connector (ie.
intel_dp->attached_connector). I suppose you could think of it
as the branch device/whatever in the topology, and we're training
the link leading to it. So that could argue for its inclusion.
But it's all getting a bit long alrady, so not going to do it
I think.

v2: Keep the connector name in the final passed/failed debug print
