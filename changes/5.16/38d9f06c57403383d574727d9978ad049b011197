hwmon: (tmp401) Drop support for TMP461

TMP461 is almost identical to TMP451, which is already supported by the
lm90 driver. At the same time, unlike other sensors from the TMP401
compatible series, it only supports 8-bit temperature read operations,
and it supports negative temperatures when configured for its default
temperature range, and it supports a temperature offset register.
Supporting this chip in the tmp401 driver adds unnecessary complexity.
Remove its support from this driver and support the chip with the lm90
driver instead.
