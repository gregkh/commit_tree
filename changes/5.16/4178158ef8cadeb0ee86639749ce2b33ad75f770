hugetlbfs: fix issue of preallocation of gigantic pages can't work

Preallocation of gigantic pages can't work bacause of commit
b5389086ad7b ("hugetlbfs: extend the definition of hugepages parameter
to support node allocation").  When nid is NUMA_NO_NODE(-1),
alloc_bootmem_huge_page will always return without doing allocation.
Fix this by adding more check.
