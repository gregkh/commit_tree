media: camss: vfe: Don't read hardware version needlessly

vfe_set_power() is invoked a few times, which causes a lot of
VFE HW version prints.

Secondly there is no real reason for calling hw_version_read() from
this location specifically, since it does nothing more than print
the VFE HW version.

A better location for the hw_version_read() call would be somewhere
which is only executed once per VFE unit.
