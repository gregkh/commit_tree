udp: using datalen to cap ipv6 udp max gso segments

The max number of UDP gso segments is intended to cap to
UDP_MAX_SEGMENTS, this is checked in udp_send_skb().

skb->len contains network and transport header len here, we should use
only data len instead.

This is the ipv6 counterpart to the below referenced commit,
which missed the ipv6 change
