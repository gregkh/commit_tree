drm/amd/display: Add missing PSR state

[why]
PSR_STATE2b was introduced on DMCUB side, but not on the driver side,
which caused convert_psr_state helper function to return
PSR_STATE_INVALID. That caused visual lagging during state transition.

[how]
Add PSR_STATE2b to dc_psr_state and convert_psr_state
