KVM: x86: Manually retrieve CPUID.0x1 when getting FMS for RESET/INIT

Manually look for a CPUID.0x1 entry instead of bouncing through
kvm_cpuid() when retrieving the Family-Model-Stepping information for
vCPU RESET/INIT.  This fixes a potential undefined behavior bug due to
kvm_cpuid() using the uninitialized "dummy" param as the ECX _input_,
a.k.a. the index.

A more minimal fix would be to simply zero "dummy", but the extra work in
kvm_cpuid() is wasteful, and KVM should be treating the FMS retrieval as
an out-of-band access, e.g. same as how KVM computes guest.MAXPHYADDR.
Both Intel's SDM and AMD's APM describe the RDX value at RESET/INIT as
holding the CPU's FMS information, not as holding CPUID.0x1.EAX.  KVM's
usage of CPUID entries to get FMS is simply a pragmatic approach to avoid
having yet another way for userspace to provide inconsistent data.

No functional change intended.
