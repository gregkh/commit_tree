IB/hfi1: Tune netdev xmit cachelines

This patch moves fields in the ring and creates a line for the producer
and the consumer.

The adds a consumer side variable that tracks the ring avail so that the
code doesn't have the read the other cacheline to get a count for every
packet. A read now only occurs when the avail is at 0.
