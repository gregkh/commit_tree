block/mq-deadline: Stop using per-CPU counters

Calculating the sum over all CPUs of per-CPU counters frequently is
inefficient. Hence switch from per-CPU to individual counters. Three
counters are protected by the mq-deadline spinlock since these are
only accessed from contexts that already hold that spinlock. The fourth
counter is atomic because protecting it with the mq-deadline spinlock
would trigger lock contention.
