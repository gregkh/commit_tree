arm64: dts: exynos: add initial support for exynosautov9 SoC

Add minimal support for ExynosAuto v9 SoC[1].

- Enumarate all pinctrl nodes
- UART with exynos850 compatible
- UFS0 HCI + Phy

Like exynos850, this also uses fixed-rate clock nodes until clock driver
has been supported. The clock nodes are initialized on bootloader stage
thus we don't need to control them so far.
