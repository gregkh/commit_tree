drm/i915/gem: Fix a lockdep warning the __i915_gem_is_lmem() function

Somehow we managed to invert the test for i915_gem_object_evictable(),
which causes a warning in DG1 BAT, igt@debugfs_test@read_all_entries.

Fix the lock check to only warn if the object *is* indeed evictable and
not protected from eviction by fences.
