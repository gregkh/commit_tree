PM: EM: Allow skipping inefficient states

The new performance domain flag EM_PERF_DOMAIN_SKIP_INEFFICIENCIES allows
to not take into account inefficient states when estimating energy
consumption. This intends to let the Energy Model know that CPUFreq itself
will skip inefficiencies and such states don't need to be part of the
estimation anymore.
