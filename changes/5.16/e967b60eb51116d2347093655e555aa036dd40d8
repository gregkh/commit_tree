mfd: ti_am335x_tscadc: Clarify the maximum values for DT entries

Clearly define the maximum open delay and sample delay. Use these
definitions in place of a mask (which works because this is the first
field in the register) and an open-coded value. While at it reword a
little bit the error messages to make them look clearer and similar.
