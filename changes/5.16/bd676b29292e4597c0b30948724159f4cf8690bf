ice: allow changing lan_en and lb_en on dflt rules

There is no way to change default lan_en and lb_en flags while
adding new rule. Add function that allows changing these flags
on ICE_SW_LKUP_DFLT recipe and any rule id.

lan_en allows packet to go outside if rule is matched. Clearing
this bit will block packet from sending it outside.

lb_en allows packet to be forwarded to other VSI. Clearing
this bit will block packet from forwarding it to other VSI.
