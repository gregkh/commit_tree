netdevsim: take rtnl_lock when assigning num_vfs

Legacy VF NDOs look at num_vfs and then based on that
index into vfconfig. If we don't rtnl_lock() num_vfs
may get set to 0 and vfconfig freed/replaced while
the NDO is running.

We don't need to protect replacing vfconfig since it's
only done when num_vfs is 0.
