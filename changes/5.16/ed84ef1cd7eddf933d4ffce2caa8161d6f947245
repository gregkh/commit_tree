clk: ingenic: Fix bugs with divided dividers

Two fixes in one:

- In the "impose hardware constraints" block, the "logical" divider
  value (aka. not translated to the hardware) was clamped to fit in the
  register area, but this totally ignored the fact that the divider
  value can itself have a fixed divider.

- The code that made sure that the divider value returned by the
  function was a multiple of its own fixed divider could result in a
  wrong value being calculated, because it was rounded down instead of
  rounded up.
