btrfs: defrag: introduce helper to defrag a contiguous prepared range

A new helper, defrag_one_locked_target(), introduced to do the real part
of defrag.

The caller needs to ensure both page and extents bits are locked, and no
ordered extent exists for the range, and all writeback is finished.

The core defrag part is pretty straight-forward:

- Reserve space
- Set extent bits to defrag
- Update involved pages to be dirty
