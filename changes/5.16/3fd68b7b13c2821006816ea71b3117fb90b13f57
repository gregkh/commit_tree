drm/panel-edp: Move some wayward panels to the eDP driver

Not all panels in panel-simple were marked what type of panel they
were. I searched through ARM/ARM64 Chromebooks or Chromebook-related
reference boards that I was aware of and found some panels that needed
to be moved. I also skimmed for panels that had no mode and were "big"
since it's quite rare to see a small eDP panel. Here's what I found:
* auo,b101ean01 - rk3288-veyron-minnie
* auo,b133htn01 - exynos5800-peach-pi
* auo,b133xtn01 - tegra124-nyan-big
* boe,nv101wxmn51 - rk3399-gru-bob
* innolux,p120zdg-bf1 - sdm845-cheza
* lg,lp079qx1-sp0v - rk3399-evb and similar
* lg,lp097qx1-spa1 - According to commit 0355dde26e52 ("drm/panel:
  simple: Add support for LG LP097QX1-SPA1 panel") this is an eDP
  panel.
* lg,lp129qe - tegra124-venice2
* samsung,lsn122dl01-c01 - According to commit 0330eaf39082
  ("drm/panel: simple: Add support for Samsung LSN122DL01-C01 panel")
  this is an eDP panel.
* samsung,ltn140at29-301 - tegra124-nyan-blaze
* sharp,ld-d5116z01b - According to commit cd5e1cbe1f0a ("drm/panel:
  simple: Add support for Sharp LD-D5116Z01B panel") this is an eDP
  panel.
* sharp,lq123p1jx31 - rk3399-gru-kevin
* starry,kr122ea0sra - rk3399-gru-gru (reference board, not upstream)

I won't promise that I didn't miss a single panel, but that's fairly
complete I think.

I'm not sure the full impact of the fact that they didn't have the
connector type specified, but at least as of commit 9f069c6fbc72
("drm/panel: panel-simple: add default connector_type") we may have
been accidentally thinking of them as DPI panels. We also would
certainly have had a warning. In any case since we don't want to
support anything eDP in the old simple-panel driver, we should move
these.
