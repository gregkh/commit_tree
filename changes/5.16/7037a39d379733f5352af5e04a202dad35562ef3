coresight: trbe: Fix handling of spurious interrupts

On a spurious IRQ, right now we disable the TRBE and then re-enable
it back, resetting the "buffer" pointers(i.e BASE, LIMIT and more
importantly WRITE) to the original pointers from the AUX handle.
This implies that we overwrite any trace that was written so far,
(by overwriting TRBPTR) while we should have ignored the IRQ.

On detecting a spurious IRQ after examining the TRBSR we simply
re-enable the TRBE without touching the other parameters.
