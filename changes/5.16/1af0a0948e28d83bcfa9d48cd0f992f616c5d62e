ethtool: don't drop the rtnl_lock half way thru the ioctl

devlink compat code needs to drop rtnl_lock to take
devlink->lock to ensure correct lock ordering.

This is problematic because we're not strictly guaranteed
that the netdev will not disappear after we re-lock.
It may open a possibility of nested ->begin / ->complete
calls.

Instead of calling into devlink under rtnl_lock take
a ref on the devlink instance and make the call after
we've dropped rtnl_lock.

We (continue to) assume that netdevs have an implicit
reference on the devlink returned from ndo_get_devlink_port

Note that ndo_get_devlink_port will now get called
under rtnl_lock. That should be fine since none of
the drivers seem to be taking serious locks inside
ndo_get_devlink_port.
