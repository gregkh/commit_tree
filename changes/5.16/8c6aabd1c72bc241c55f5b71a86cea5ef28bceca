nfsd/blocklayout: use ->get_unique_id instead of sending SCSI commands

Call the ->get_unique_id method to query the SCSI identifiers.  This can
use the cached VPD page in the sd driver instead of sending a command
on every LAYOUTGET.  It will also allow to support NVMe based volumes
if the draft for that ever takes off.
