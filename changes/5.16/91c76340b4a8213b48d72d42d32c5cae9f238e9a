ext4: docs: switch away from list-table

Commit 3a6541e97c03 (Add documentation about the orphan file feature) added
a new document on orphan files, which is great.  But the use of
"list-table" results in documents that are absolutely unreadable in their
plain-text form.  Switch this file to the regular RST table format instead;
the rendered (HTML) output is identical.
