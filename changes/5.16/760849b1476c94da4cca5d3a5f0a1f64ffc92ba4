KVM: x86: Make sure KVM_CPUID_FEATURES really are KVM_CPUID_FEATURES

Currently when kvm_update_cpuid_runtime() runs, it assumes that the
KVM_CPUID_FEATURES leaf is located at 0x40000001. This is not true,
however, if Hyper-V support is enabled. In this case the KVM leaves will
be offset.

This patch introdues as new 'kvm_cpuid_base' field into struct
kvm_vcpu_arch to track the location of the KVM leaves and function
kvm_update_kvm_cpuid_base() (called from kvm_set_cpuid()) to locate the
leaves using the 'KVMKVMKVM\0\0\0' signature (which is now given a
definition in kvm_para.h). Adjustment of KVM_CPUID_FEATURES will hence now
target the correct leaf.

NOTE: A new for_each_possible_hypervisor_cpuid_base() macro is intoduced
      into processor.h to avoid having duplicate code for the iteration
      over possible hypervisor base leaves.
