coresight: trbe: Make sure we have enough space

The TRBE driver makes sure that there is enough space for a meaningful
run, otherwise pads the given space and restarts the offset calculation
once. But there is no guarantee that we may find space or hit "no space".
Make sure that we repeat the step until, either :
  - We have the minimum space
   OR
  - There is NO space at all.
