platform/x86: Rename wmaa-backlight-wmi to nvidia-wmi-ec-backlight

Rename the wmaa-backlight-wmi driver and associated KConfig option to
remove the remaining references to the "WMAA" ACPI handle which was
used in the previous name. The driver has already been updated to
remove internal references to "WMAA". As part of the renaming, the
components in the name have been rearranged to reflect the standard
vendor_wmi_feature pattern.
