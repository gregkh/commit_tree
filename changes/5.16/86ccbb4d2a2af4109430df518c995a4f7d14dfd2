btrfs: handle errors properly inside btrfs_submit_compressed_read()

There are quite some BUG_ON()s inside btrfs_submit_compressed_read(),
namely all errors inside the for() loop relies on BUG_ON() to handle
-ENOMEM.

Handle these errors properly by:

- Wait for submitted bios to finish first
  Using wake_var_event() APIs to wait without introducing extra memory
  overhead inside compressed_bio.
  This allows us to wait for any submitted bio to finish, while still
  keeps the compressed_bio from being freed.

- Introduce finish_compressed_bio_read() to finish the compressed_bio

- Properly end the bio and finish compressed_bio when error happens

Now in btrfs_submit_compressed_read() even when the bio submission
failed, we can properly handle the error without triggering BUG_ON().
