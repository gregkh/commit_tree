usb: xhci: Use to_pci_driver() instead of pci_dev->driver

Struct pci_driver contains a struct device_driver, so for PCI devices, it's
easy to convert a device_driver * to a pci_driver * with to_pci_driver().
The device_driver * is in struct device, so we don't need to also keep
track of the pci_driver * in struct pci_dev.

Replace pdev->driver with to_pci_driver().  This is a step toward removing
pci_dev->driver.
