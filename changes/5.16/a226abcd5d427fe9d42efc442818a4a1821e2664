io-wq: don't retry task_work creation failure on fatal conditions

We don't want to be retrying task_work creation failure if there's
an actual signal pending for the parent task. If we do, then we can
enter an infinite loop of perpetually retrying and each retry failing
with -ERESTARTNOINTR because a signal is pending.
