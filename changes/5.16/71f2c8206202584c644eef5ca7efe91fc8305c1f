f2fs: multidevice: support direct IO

Commit 3c62be17d4f5 ("f2fs: support multiple devices") missed
to support direct IO for multiple device feature, this patch
adds to support the missing part of multidevice feature.

In addition, for multiple device image, we should be aware of
any issued direct write IO rather than just buffered write IO,
so that fsync and syncfs can issue a preflush command to the
device where direct write IO goes, to persist user data for
posix compliant.
