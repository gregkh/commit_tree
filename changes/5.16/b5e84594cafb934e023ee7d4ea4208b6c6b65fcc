mm/writeback: Add folio_mark_dirty()

Reimplement set_page_dirty() as a wrapper around folio_mark_dirty().
There is no change to filesystems as they were already being called
with the compound_head of the page being marked dirty.  We avoid
several calls to compound_head(), both statically (through
using folio_test_dirty() instead of PageDirty() and dynamically by
calling folio_mapping() instead of page_mapping().

Also return bool instead of int to show the range of values actually
returned, and add kernel-doc.
