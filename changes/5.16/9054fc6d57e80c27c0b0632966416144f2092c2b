ACPI: Get acpi_device's parent from the parent field

Printk modifier %pfw is used to print the full path of the device name.
This is obtained device by device until a device no longer has a parent.

On ACPI getting the parent fwnode is done by calling acpi_get_parent()
which tries to down() a semaphore. But local IRQs are now disabled in
vprintk_store() before the mutex is acquired. This is obviously a problem.

Luckily struct device, embedded in struct acpi_device, has a parent field
already. Use that field to get the parent instead of relying on
acpi_get_parent().
