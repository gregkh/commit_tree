ice: Don't put stale timestamps in the skb

The driver has to check if it does not accidentally put the timestamp in
the SKB before previous timestamp gets overwritten.
Timestamp values in the PHY are read only and do not get cleared except
at hardware reset or when a new timestamp value is captured.
The cached_tstamp field is used to detect the case where a new timestamp
has not yet been captured, ensuring that we avoid sending stale
timestamp data to the stack.
