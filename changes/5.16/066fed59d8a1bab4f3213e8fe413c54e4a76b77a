mm/vmalloc: check various alignments when debugging

Before we did not guarantee a free block with lowest start address for
allocations with alignment >= PAGE_SIZE.  Because an alignment overhead
was included into a search length like below:

     length = size + align - 1;

doing so we make sure that a bigger block would fit after applying an
alignment adjustment.  Now there is no such limitation, i.e.  any
alignment that user wants to apply will result to a lowest address of
returned free area.
