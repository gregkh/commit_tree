media: staging/intel-ipu3: css: Fix wrong size comparison imgu_css_fw_init

There is a wrong comparison of the total size of the loaded firmware
css->fw->size with the size of a pointer to struct imgu_fw_header.

Turn binary_header into a flexible-array member[1][2], use the
struct_size() helper and fix the wrong size comparison. Notice
that the loaded firmware needs to contain at least one 'struct
imgu_fw_info' item in the binary_header[] array.

It's also worth mentioning that

	"css->fw->size < struct_size(css->fwp, binary_header, 1)"

with binary_header declared as a flexible-array member is equivalent
to

	"css->fw->size < sizeof(struct imgu_fw_header)"

with binary_header declared as a one-element array (as in the original
code).

The replacement of the one-element array with a flexible-array member
also helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
on memcpy().
