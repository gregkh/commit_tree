dt-bindings: sdhci-omap: Update binding for legacy SoCs

Let's add compatible values for the legacy SoCs so we can continue
deprecating omap_hsmmc in favor of sdhci-omap driver.

For omap5, we want to have a separate compatible from omap4 for the
additional features available on omap5. AFAIK ti81 can just use the
omap4 compatible.
