arm64: kexec: configure EL2 vectors for kexec

If we have a EL2 mode without VHE, the EL2 vectors are needed in order
to switch to EL2 and jump to new world with hypervisor privileges.

In preparation to MMU enabled relocation, configure our EL2 table now.

Kexec uses #HVC_SOFT_RESTART to branch to the new world, so extend
el1_sync vector that is provided by trans_pgd_copy_el2_vectors() to
support this case.
