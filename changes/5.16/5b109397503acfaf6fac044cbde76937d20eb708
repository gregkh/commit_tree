drm/amd/display: Enable dpia in dmub only for DCN31 B0

[Why]
DMUB binary is common for both A0 and B0. Hence, driver should
notify FW about the support for DPIA in B0.

[How]
Added dpia_supported bit in dmub_fw_boot_options and will be set
only for B0.

Assign dpia_supported to true before dm_dmub_hw_init
in B0 case.

v2: fix build without CONFIG_DRM_AMD_DC_DCN (Alex)
