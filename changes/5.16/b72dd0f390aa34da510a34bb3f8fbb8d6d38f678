media: vivid: add module option to set request support mode

Currently vivid supports the Request API, but it also sets
min_buffers_needed in the vb2 queue. But the combination of
support_requests and min_buffers_needed is not allowed due to
the fact that vb2_core_qbuf() isn't supposed to fail when called
from the request framework. And if min_buffers_needed > 0, then
is can call start_streaming() which definitely can fail.

With the new module option you can control if requests are not
allowed (min_buffers_needed is 2 in that case), optionally allowed
or are required. In the latter two cases min_buffers_needed is set
to 0.
