    drm/ttm: Refuse to fault (prime-) imported pages

we introduced the restriction that imported pages should not be directly
mappable through TTM(this also extends to userptr). In the next patch we
want to introduce a shmem_tt backend, which should follow all the
existing rules with TTM_PAGE_FLAG_EXTERNAL, since it will need to handle
swapping itself, but with the above mapping restriction lifted.

v2(Christian):
  - Don't OR together EXTERNAL and EXTERNAL_MAPPABLE in the definition
    of EXTERNAL_MAPPABLE, just leave it the caller to handle this
    correctly, otherwise we might encounter subtle issues.
