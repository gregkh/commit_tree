soc: qcom: Add Sleep stats driver

Let's add a driver to read the stats from remote processor and
export to debugfs.

The driver creates "qcom_sleep_stats" directory in debugfs and
adds files for various low power mode available. Below is sample
output with command

cat /sys/kernel/debug/qcom_sleep_stats/ddr
count = 0
Last Entered At = 0
Last Exited At = 0
Accumulated Duration = 0
