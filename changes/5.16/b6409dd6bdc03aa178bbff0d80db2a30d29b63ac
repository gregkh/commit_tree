ALSA: ctl: Fix copy of updated id with element read/write

When control_compat.c:copy_ctl_value_to_user() is used, by
ctl_elem_read_user() & ctl_elem_write_user(), it must also copy back the
snd_ctl_elem_id value that may have been updated (filled in) by the call
to snd_ctl_elem_read/snd_ctl_elem_write().

This matches the functionality provided by snd_ctl_elem_read_user() and
snd_ctl_elem_write_user(), via snd_ctl_build_ioff().

Without this, and without making additional calls to snd_ctl_info()
which are unnecessary when using the non-compat calls, a userspace
application will not know the numid value for the element and
consequently will not be able to use the poll/read interface on the
control file to determine which elements have updates.
