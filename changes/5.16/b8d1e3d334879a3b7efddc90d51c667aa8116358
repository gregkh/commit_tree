arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180-trogdor: Delete ADC config for unused thermistors

The charger thermistor on Lazor, CoachZ rev1 and Pompom rev1+2 is
either the wrong part or not stuffed at all, the same is true for
the skin temperature thermistor on CoachZ rev1. The corresponding
thermal zones are already disabled for these devices, in addition
delete the ADC nodes of the thermistors.

For Lazor and CoachZ rev1 also disable the PM6150 ADC and thermal
monitor since none of the ADC channels is used.
