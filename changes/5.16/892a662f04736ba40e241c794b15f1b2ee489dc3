bnxt_en: add enable_remote_dev_reset devlink parameter

The reported parameter value should not take into account the state
of remote drivers. Firmware will reject remote resets as appropriate,
thus it is not strictly necessary to check HOT_RESET_ALLOWED before
attempting to initiate a reset. But we add the check so that we can
provide more intuitive messages when reset is not permitted.

This firmware setting needs to be restored from all functions after
a firmware reset.
