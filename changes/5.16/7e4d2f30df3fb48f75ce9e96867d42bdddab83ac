drm/amd/display: Set exit_optimized_pwr_state for DCN31

[Why]
SMU now respects the PHY refclk disable request from driver.

This causes a hang during hotplug when PHY refclk was disabled
because it's not being re-enabled and the transmitter control
starts on dc_link_detect.

[How]
We normally would re-enable the clk with exit_optimized_pwr_state
but this is only set on DCN21 and DCN301. Set it for dcn31 as well.

This fixes DMCUB timeouts in the PHY.
