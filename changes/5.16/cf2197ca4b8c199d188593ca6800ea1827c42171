bcache: move uapi header bcache.h to bcache code directory

The header file include/uapi/linux/bcache.h is not really a user space
API heaer. This file defines the ondisk format of bcache internal meta
data but no one includes it from user space, bcache-tools has its own
copy of this header with minor modification.

Therefore, this patch moves include/uapi/linux/bcache.h to bcache code
directory as drivers/md/bcache/bcache_ondisk.h.
