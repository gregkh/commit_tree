memory-hotplug.rst: fix two instances of "movablecore" that should be "movable_node"

Patch series "memory-hotplug.rst: document the "auto-movable" online
policy".

Now that the memory-hotplug.rst overhaul is upstream, proper
documentation for the "auto-movable" online policy, documenting all new
toggles and options.  Along, two fixes for the original overhaul.

This patch (of 3):

We really want to refer to the "movable_node" kernel command line
parameter here.
