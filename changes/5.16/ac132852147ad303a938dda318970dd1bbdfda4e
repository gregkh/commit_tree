net/ncsi : Add payload to be 32-bit aligned to fix dropped packets

Update NC-SI command handler (both standard and OEM) to take into
account of payload paddings in allocating skb (in case of payload
size is not 32-bit aligned).

The checksum field follows payload field, without taking payload
padding into account can cause checksum being truncated, leading to
dropped packets.
