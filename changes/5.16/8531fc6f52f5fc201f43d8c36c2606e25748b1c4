hugetlb: add hugetlb demote page support

Demote page functionality will split a huge page into a number of huge
pages of a smaller size.  For example, on x86 a 1GB huge page can be
demoted into 512 2M huge pages.  Demotion is done 'in place' by simply
splitting the huge page.

Added '*_for_demote' wrappers for remove_hugetlb_page,
destroy_compound_hugetlb_page and prep_compound_gigantic_page for use by
demote code.
