can: etas_es58x: es58x_rx_err_msg(): fix memory leak in error path

In es58x_rx_err_msg(), if can->do_set_mode() fails, the function
directly returns without calling netif_rx(skb). This means that the
skb previously allocated by alloc_can_err_skb() is not freed. In other
terms, this is a memory leak.

This patch simply removes the return statement in the error branch and
let the function continue.

Issue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for
details.
