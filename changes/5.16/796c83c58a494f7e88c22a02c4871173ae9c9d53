KVM: Move INVPCID type check from vmx and svm to the common kvm_handle_invpcid()

Handle #GP on INVPCID due to an invalid type in the common switch
statement instead of relying on the callers (VMX and SVM) to manually
validate the type.

Unlike INVVPID and INVEPT, INVPCID is not explicitly documented to check
the type before reading the operand from memory, so deferring the
type validity check until after that point is architecturally allowed.
