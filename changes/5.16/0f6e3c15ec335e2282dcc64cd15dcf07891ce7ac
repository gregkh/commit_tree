clk: imx: disable i.mx7ulp composite clock during initialization

i.MX7ULP peripheral clock ONLY allow parent/rate to be changed
with clock gated, however, during clock tree initialization, the
peripheral clock could be enabled by bootloader, but the prepare
count in clock tree is still zero, so clock core driver will allow
parent/rate changed even with CLK_SET_RATE_GATE/CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE
set, but the change will fail due to HW NOT allow parent/rate change
with clock enabled. It will cause clock HW status mismatch with
clock tree info and lead to function issue. Below is an example:

usdhc0's pcc clock value is 0xC5000000 during kernel boot up, it
means usdhc0 clock is enabled, its parent is APLL_PFD1. In DT file,
the usdhc0 clock settings are as below:

assigned-clocks = <&pcc2 IMX7ULP_CLK_USDHC0>;
assigned-clock-parents = <&scg1 IMX7ULP_CLK_NIC1_DIV>;

when kernel boot up, the clock tree info is as below, but the usdhc0
PCC register is still 0xC5000000, which means its parent is still
from APLL_PFD1, which is incorrect and cause usdhc0 NOT work.

nic1_clk       2        2        0   176000000          0     0  50000
    usdhc0       0        0        0   176000000          0     0  50000

After making sure the peripheral clock is disabled during clock tree
initialization, the usdhc0 is working, and this change is necessary
for all i.MX7ULP peripheral clocks.
