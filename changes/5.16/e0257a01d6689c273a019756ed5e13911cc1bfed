perf pmu: Fix alias events list

Commit 0e0ae8742207c3b4 ("perf list: Display hybrid PMU events with cpu
type") changes the event list for uncore PMUs or arm64 heterogeneous CPU
systems, such that duplicate aliases are incorrectly listed per PMU
(which they should not be), like:

  # perf list
  ...
  unc_cbo_cache_lookup.any_es
  [Unit: uncore_cbox L3 Lookup any request that access cache and found
  line in E or S-state]
  unc_cbo_cache_lookup.any_es
  [Unit: uncore_cbox L3 Lookup any request that access cache and found
  line in E or S-state]
  unc_cbo_cache_lookup.any_i
  [Unit: uncore_cbox L3 Lookup any request that access cache and found
  line in I-state]
  unc_cbo_cache_lookup.any_i
  [Unit: uncore_cbox L3 Lookup any request that access cache and found
  line in I-state]
  ...

Notice how the events are listed twice.

The named commit changed how we remove duplicate events, in that events
for different PMUs are not treated as duplicates. I suppose this is to
handle how "Each hybrid pmu event has been assigned with a pmu name".

Fix PMU alias listing by restoring behaviour to remove duplicates for
non-hybrid PMUs.
