scsi: libiscsi: Move ehwait initialization to iscsi_session_setup()

Commit ec29d0ac29be ("scsi: iscsi: Fix conn use after free during resets")
moved member ehwait from 'conn' to 'session', but left the initialization
of ehwait in iscsi_conn_setup().

Although a session can only have 1 conn currently, it is better to
initialize ehwait in iscsi_session_setup() in case we implement handling
multiple conns in the future.
