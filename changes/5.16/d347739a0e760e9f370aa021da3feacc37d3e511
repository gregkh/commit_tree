fuse: always invalidate attributes after writes

Extend the fuse_write_update_attr() helper to invalidate cached attributes
after a write.

This has already been done in all cases except in fuse_notify_store(), so
this is mostly a cleanup.

fuse_direct_write_iter() calls fuse_direct_IO() which already calls
fuse_write_update_attr(), so don't repeat that again in the former.
