ftrace: Use direct_ops hash in unregister_ftrace_direct

Now when we have *direct_multi interface the direct_functions
hash is no longer owned just by direct_ops. It's also used by
any other ftrace_ops passed to *direct_multi interface.

Thus to find out that we are unregistering the last function
from direct_ops, we need to check directly direct_ops's hash.
