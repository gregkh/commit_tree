ASoC: simple-card-utils: Increase maximum DAI links limit to 512

The current limit of 128 is not sufficient when more components are
added to the audio map on Tegra210 and later platforms. Thus it is
resulting in probe failure.

The requirement is of nearly ~200 DAI links. To give sufficient room
for future additions the maximum limit is increased to 512 DAI links.
This is a preparatory patch to add more components like resampler,
mixer, multiplexers, demultiplexers and volume controllers to Tegra210
and later platforms.
