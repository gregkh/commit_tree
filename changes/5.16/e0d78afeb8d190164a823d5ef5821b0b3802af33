block: fix too broad elevator check in blk_mq_free_request()

We added RQF_ELV to tell whether there's an IO scheduler attached, and
RQF_ELVPRIV tells us whether there's an IO scheduler with private data
attached. Don't check RQF_ELV in blk_mq_free_request(), what we care
about here is just if we have scheduler private data attached.

This fixes a boot crash
