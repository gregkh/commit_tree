flex_proportions: Allow N events instead of 1

When batching events (such as writing back N pages in a single I/O), it
is better to do one flex_proportion operation instead of N.  There is
only one caller of __fprop_inc_percpu_max(), and it's the one we're
going to change in the next patch, so rename it instead of adding a
compatibility wrapper.
