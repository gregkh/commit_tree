powerpc: Drop superfluous pci_dev_is_added() calls

On powerpc, pci_dev_is_added() is called as part of SR-IOV fixups
that are done under pcibios_add_device() which in turn is only called in
pci_device_add() whih is called when a PCI device is scanned.

pci_dev_assign_added() is called in pci_bus_add_device() which is only
called after scanning the device. Thus pci_dev_is_added() is always
false and can be dropped.
