arm64: zynqmp: Add reset-on-timeout to all boards and modify default timeout value

This patch adds reset-on-timeout to FPD WDT which will trigger an
interrupt to PMU when watchdog expiry happens and PMU takes the
necessary action. If this property is not enabled, reason will not be
known when watchdog expiry happens.
This patch also modifies the default timeout to 60 seconds. Reason is
that if u-boot enables WDT, it will set the timeout to 10 seconds and
this is not enough to boot till Linux and start the WDT application in
Linux. 60 seconds is the maximum safest value to boot till Linux and
start the WDT application.

Users need to change this timeout value to fit their needs.
