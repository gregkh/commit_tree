x86/fpu: Add size and mask information to fpstate

Add state size and feature mask information to the fpstate container. This
will be used for runtime checks with the upcoming support for dynamically
enabled features and dynamically sized buffers. That avoids conditionals
all over the place as the required information is accessible for both
default and extended buffers.
