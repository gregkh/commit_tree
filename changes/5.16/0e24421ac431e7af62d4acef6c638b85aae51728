ceph: fix mdsmap decode when there are MDS's beyond max_mds

If the max_mds is decreased in a cephfs cluster, there is a window
of time before the MDSs are removed. If a map goes out during this
period, the mdsmap may show the decreased max_mds but still shows
those MDSes as in or in the export target list.

Ensure that we don't fail the map decode in that case.
