HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: only enable IRQ wakeup when requested

Fixes spurious wakeups from s0ix on Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Cargon Gen 9 on
lid close.

These wakeups are generated by interrupts from the ISH on changes to the
lid status.

By disabling the wake IRQ from the ISH we inhibit these spurious
wakeups while keeping the resume from LID open through the ACPI
interrupt.

Reports on the Lenovo forums indicate that Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen6
is also affected.
