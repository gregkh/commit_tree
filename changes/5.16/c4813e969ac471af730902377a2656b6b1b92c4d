libbpf: Deprecate ambiguously-named bpf_program__size() API

The name of the API doesn't convey clearly that this size is in number
of bytes (there needed to be a separate comment to make this clear in
libbpf.h). Further, measuring the size of BPF program in bytes is not
exactly the best fit, because BPF programs always consist of 8-byte
instructions. As such, bpf_program__insn_cnt() is a better alternative
in pretty much any imaginable case.

So schedule bpf_program__size() deprecation starting from v0.7 and it
will be removed in libbpf 1.0.
