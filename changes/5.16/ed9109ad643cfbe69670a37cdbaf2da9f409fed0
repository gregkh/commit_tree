selftests/bpf: Add bloom filter map test cases

This patch adds test cases for bpf bloom filter maps. They include tests
checking against invalid operations by userspace, tests for using the
bloom filter map as an inner map, and a bpf program that queries the
bloom filter map for values added by a userspace program.
