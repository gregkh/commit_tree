iio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: add support for separate end of conversion registers

Some platforms have separated the end-of-conversion information from the
usual ISR/IMR/IER/IDR registers, into EOC_ISR/EOC_IMR/EOC_IER/EOC_IDR.
To cope with both variants, helpers are being added, that will make
code more clear and more easy to read.
