leaking_addresses: Always print a trailing newline

For files that lack trailing newlines and match a leaking address (e.g.
wchan[1]), the leaking_addresses.pl report would run together with the
next line, making things look corrupted.

Unconditionally remove the newline on input, and write it back out on
output.
