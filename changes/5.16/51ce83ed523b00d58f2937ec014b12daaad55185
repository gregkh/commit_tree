sched: reduce sched slice for SCHED_IDLE entities

Use a small, non-scaled min granularity for SCHED_IDLE entities, when
competing with normal entities. This reduces the latency of getting
a normal entity back on cpu, at the expense of increased context
switch frequency of SCHED_IDLE entities.

The benefit of this change is to reduce the round-robin latency for
normal entities when competing with a SCHED_IDLE entity.

Example: on a machine with HZ=1000, spawned two threads, one of which is
SCHED_IDLE, and affined to one cpu. Without this patch, the SCHED_IDLE
thread runs for 4ms then waits for 1.4s. With this patch, it runs for
1ms and waits 340ms (as it round-robins with the other thread).
