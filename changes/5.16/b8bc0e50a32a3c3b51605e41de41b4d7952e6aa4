ARM: add __arm_iomem_set_ro() to write-protect ioremapped area

__arm_iomem_set_ro() marks an ioremapped area read-only. This is
intended for use with __arm_ioremap_exec() to allow the kernel to
write some code into e.g. SRAM and then write-protect it so the
kernel doesn't complain about W+X mappings.
