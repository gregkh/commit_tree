usb: gadget: f_mass_storage: Disable eps during disconnect

When receiving a disconnect event from the UDC, the mass storage
function driver currently runs the handle_exception() routine
asynchronously.  For UDCs that support runtime PM, there is a
possibility the UDC is already suspended by the time the
do_set_interface() is executed.  This can lead to HW register access
while the UDC is already suspended.
