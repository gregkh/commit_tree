ASoC: tegra: Add routes for few AHUB modules

Add routing support for following modules of AHUB:
 * SFC (Sampling Frequency Converter)
 * MVC (Master Volume Control)
 * AMX (Audio Multiplexer)
 * ADX (Audio Demultiplexer)
 * Mixer

These modules can be plugged into audio path as per the need using
routing controls similar to the already existing routes to I/O modules
such as I2S, DMIC and DSPK.
