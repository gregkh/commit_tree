io-wq: remove spurious bit clear on task_work addition

There's a small race here where the task_work could finish and drop
the worker itself, so that by the time that task_work_add() returns
with a successful addition we've already put the worker.

The worker callbacks clear this bit themselves, so we don't actually
need to manually clear it in the caller. Get rid of it.
