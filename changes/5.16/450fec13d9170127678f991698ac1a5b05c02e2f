tracing/histograms: String compares should not care about signed values

When comparing two strings for the "onmatch" histogram trigger, fields
that are strings use string comparisons, which do not care about being
signed or not.

Do not fail to match two string fields if one is unsigned char array and
the other is a signed char array.
