rcu-tasks: Correct comparisons for CPU numbers in show_stalled_task_trace

Valid CPU numbers can be zero or greater, but the checks for
->trc_ipi_to_cpu and tick_nohz_full_cpu()'s argument are for strictly
greater than.  This commit therefore corrects the check for no_hz_full
cpu in show_stalled_task_trace() so as to include cpu 0.
