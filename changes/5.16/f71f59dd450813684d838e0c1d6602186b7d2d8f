ASoC: SOF: Introduce snd_sof_mailbox_read / snd_sof_mailbox_write callbacks

We need to introduce snd_sof_mailbox_{read/write} in order to provide
a generic way for mailbox access. These routines are optional, each
platform can implement their own specific routines.

So far, all platforms use mmapped I/O thus they can use custom made
routines sof_mailbox_read / sof_mailbox_write that use MMIO.
