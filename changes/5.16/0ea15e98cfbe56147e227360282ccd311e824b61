ASoC: rockchip: i2s-tdm: Fix refcount test

During development of V5 of the i2s-tdm patch series, I replaced
the atomic refcount with a regular integer, as it was only ever
accessed within a spinlock.

Foolishly, I got the semantics of atomic_dec_and_test wrong, which
resulted in a test for 0 actually becoming a test for >0.

The result was that setting the audio frequency broke; switching
from 44100 Hz audio playback to 96000 Hz audio playback would
garble the sound most unpleasantly.

Fix this by checking for --refcount == 0, which is what it should
have been all along.
