coresight: tmc-etr: Use perf_output_handle::head for AUX ring buffer

When enable the Arm CoreSight PMU event, the context for AUX ring buffer
is prepared in the structure perf_output_handle, and its field "head"
points the head of the AUX ring buffer and it is updated after filling
AUX trace data into buffer.

Current code uses an extra field etr_perf_buffer::head to maintain the
header for the AUX ring buffer which is not necessary; alternatively,
it's better to directly use perf_output_handle::head.

This patch removes the field etr_perf_buffer::head and directly uses
perf_output_handle::head for the head of AUX ring buffer.
