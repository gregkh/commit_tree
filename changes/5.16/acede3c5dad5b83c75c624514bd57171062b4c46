net: enetc: declare NETIF_F_HW_CSUM and do it in software

This is just a preparation patch for software TSO in the enetc driver.
Unfortunately, ENETC does not support Tx checksum offload which would
normally render TSO, even software, impossible.

Declare NETIF_F_HW_CSUM as part of the feature set and do it at driver
level using skb_csum_hwoffload_help() so that we can move forward and
also add support for TSO in the next patch.
