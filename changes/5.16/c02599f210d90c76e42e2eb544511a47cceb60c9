f2fs: avoid attaching SB_ACTIVE flag during mount

Quoted from [1]

"I do remember that I've added this code back then because otherwise
orphan cleanup was losing updates to quota files. But you're right
that now I don't see how that could be happening and it would be nice
if we could get rid of this hack"

Related fix in ext4 by
commit 72ffb49a7b62 ("ext4: do not set SB_ACTIVE in ext4_orphan_cleanup()").

f2fs has the same hack implementation in
- f2fs_recover_orphan_inodes()
- f2fs_recover_fsync_data()

Let's get rid of this hack as well in f2fs.
