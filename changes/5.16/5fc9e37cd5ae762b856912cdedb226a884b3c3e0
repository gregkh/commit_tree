ucounts: Remove unnecessary test for NULL ucount in get_ucounts

All of the callers of get_ucounts are passeds a non-NULL value so stop
handling a NULL ucounts pointer in get_ucounts.

It is guaranteed that ever valid fully formed cred that is passed to
commit_cred contains a non-NULL ucounts pointer.  This in turn
gurantees that current_ucounts() never returns NULL.

The call of get_ucounts in user_shm_lock is always passed
current_ucounts().

The call of get_ucounts in mqueue_get_inode is always passed
current_ucounts().

The call of get_ucounts in inc_rlmit_get_ucounts is always
passed iter, after iter has been verified to be non-NULL.

The call of get_ucounts in key_change_session_keyring is always passed
current_ucounts().

The call of get_ucounts in prepare_cred is always passed
current_ucounts().

The call of get_ucounts in prepare_kernel_cred is always
passed task->cred->ucounts or init_cred->ucounts which
being on tasks are guaranteed to have a non-NULL ucounts
field.
