usb: gadget: uvc: fix multiple opens

Currently, the UVC function is activated when open on the corresponding
v4l2 device is called.  On another open the activation of the function
fails since the deactivation counter in `usb_function_activate` equals
0. However the error is not returned to userspace since the open of the
v4l2 device is successful.

On a close the function is deactivated (since deactivation counter still
equals 0) and the video is disabled in `uvc_v4l2_release`, although the
UVC application potentially is streaming.

Move activation of UVC function to subscription on UVC_EVENT_SETUP
because there we can guarantee for a userspace application utilizing
UVC.  Block subscription on UVC_EVENT_SETUP while another application
already is subscribed to it, indicated by `bool func_connected` in
`struct uvc_device`.  Extend the `struct uvc_file_handle` with member
`bool is_uvc_app_handle` to tag it as the handle used by the userspace
UVC application.

With this a process is able to check capabilities of the v4l2 device
without deactivating the function for the actual UVC application.
