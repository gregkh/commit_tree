drm/i915/selftests: Add initial GuC selftest for scrubbing lost G2H

While debugging an issue with full GT resets I went down a rabbit hole
thinking the scrubbing of lost G2H wasn't working correctly. This proved
to be incorrect as this was working just fine but this chase inspired me
to write a selftest to prove that this works. This simple selftest
injects errors dropping various G2H and then issues a full GT reset
proving that the scrubbing of these G2H doesn't blow up.

v2:
 (Daniel Vetter)
  - Use ifdef instead of macros for selftests
v3:
 (Checkpatch)
  - A space after 'switch' statement
v4:
 (Daniele)
  - A comment saying GT won't idle if G2H are lost
