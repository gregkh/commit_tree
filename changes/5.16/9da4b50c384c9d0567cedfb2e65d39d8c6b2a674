staging: vt6655: Use named constants when checking preamble type

Compare `preamble_type` to a predefined constant, `PREAMBLE_SHORT`,
instead of a literal in `bb_get_frame_time` and `vnt_get_phy_field`
functions. Thanks to this change, it is clear that we check
the type of a preamble, not just compare it against an arbitrary value.
Remove a redundant comment.
