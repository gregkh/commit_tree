irq_work: Allow irq_work_sync() to sleep if irq_work() no IRQ support.

irq_work() triggers instantly an interrupt if supported by the
architecture. Otherwise the work will be processed on the next timer
tick. In worst case irq_work_sync() could spin up to a jiffy.

irq_work_sync() is usually used in tear down context which is fully
preemptible. Based on review irq_work_sync() is invoked from preemptible
context and there is one waiter at a time. This qualifies it to use
rcuwait for synchronisation.

Let irq_work_sync() synchronize with rcuwait if the architecture
processes irqwork via the timer tick.
