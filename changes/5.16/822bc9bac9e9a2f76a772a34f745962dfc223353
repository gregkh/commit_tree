cgroup: no need for cgroup_mutex for /proc/cgroups

On the real systems, the cgroups hierarchies are setup early and just
once by the node controller, so, other than number of cgroups, all
information in /proc/cgroups remain same for the system uptime. Let's
remove the cgroup_mutex usage on reading /proc/cgroups. There is a
chance of inconsistent number of cgroups for co-mounted cgroups while
printing the information from /proc/cgroups but that is not a big
issue. In addition /proc/cgroups is a v1 specific interface, so the
dependency on it should reduce over time.

The main motivation for removing the cgroup_mutex from /proc/cgroups is
to reduce the avenues of its contention. On our fleet, we have observed
buggy application hammering on /proc/cgroups and drastically slowing
down the node controller on the system which have many negative
consequences on other workloads running on the system.
