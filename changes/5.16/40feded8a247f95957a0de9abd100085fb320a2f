i40e: Fix for displaying message regarding NVM version

When loading the i40e driver, it prints a message like: 'The driver for the
device detected a newer version of the NVM image v1.x than expected v1.y.
Please install the most recent version of the network driver.' This is
misleading as the driver is working as expected.

Fix that by removing the second part of message and changing it from
dev_info to dev_dbg.
