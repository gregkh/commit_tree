net: hns3: allow configure ETS bandwidth of all TCs

Currently, driver only allow configuring ETS bandwidth of TCs according
to the max TC number queried from firmware. However, the hardware actually
supports 8 TCs and users may need to configure ETS bandwidth of all TCs,
so remove the restriction.
