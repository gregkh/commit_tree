hugetlb: remove unnecessary set_page_count in prep_compound_gigantic_page

In commit 7118fc2906e2 ("hugetlb: address ref count racing in
prep_compound_gigantic_page"), page_ref_freeze is used to atomically
zero the ref count of tail pages iff they are 1.  The unconditional call
to set_page_count(0) was left in the code.  This call is after
page_ref_freeze so it is really a noop.

Remove redundant and unnecessary set_page_count call.
