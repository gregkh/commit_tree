hwmon: (nct6775) mask out bank number in nct6775_wmi_read_value()

The first call to nct6775_asuswmi_read() in nct6775_wmi_read_value()
had been passing the full bank+register number instead of just the
lower 8 bits.  It didn't end up actually causing problems because the
second argument of that function is a u8 anyway, but it seems
preferable to be explicit about it at the call site (and consistent
with the rest of the code).
