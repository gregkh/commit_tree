clk: qcom: Add Global Clock Controller driver for QCM2290

Add Global Clock Controller (GCC) driver for QCM2290.  This is a porting
of gcc-scuba driver from CAF msm-4.19, with GDSC support added on top.

Because the alpha_pll on the platform has a different register
layout (offsets), its own clk_alpha_pll_regs_offset[] is used in the
driver.
