Docs: Fixes link to I2C specification

The link to the I2C specification is broken. Although
"https://www.nxp.com" hosts Rev 7 (2021) of this specification, it is
behind a login-wall. Thus, an additional link has been added (which
doesn't require a login) and the NXP official docs link has been
updated.
