staging: most: dim2: do not double-register the same device

Commit 723de0f9171e ("staging: most: remove device from interface
structure") moved registration of driver-provided struct device to
the most subsystem.

Dim2 used to register the same struct device to provide a custom device
attribute. This causes double-registration of the same struct device.

Fix that by moving the custom attribute to driver's dev_groups.
This moves attribute to the platform_device object, which is a better
location for platform-specific attributes anyway.
