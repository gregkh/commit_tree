block: move queue enter logic into blk_mq_submit_bio()

Retain the old logic for the fops based submit, but for our internal
blk_mq_submit_bio(), move the queue entering logic into the core
function itself.

We need to be a bit careful if going into the scheduler, as a scheduler
or queue mappings can arbitrarily change before we have entered the queue.
Have the bio scheduler mapping do that separately, it's a very cheap
operation compared to actually doing merging locking and lookups.
