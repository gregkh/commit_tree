i2c: xiic: Fix RX IRQ busy check

In case the XIIC does TX/RX transfer, make sure no other kernel thread
can start another TX transfer at the same time. This could happen since
the driver only checks tx_msg for being non-NULL and returns -EBUSY in
that case, however it is necessary to check also rx_msg for the same.
