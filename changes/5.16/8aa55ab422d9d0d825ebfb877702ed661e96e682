i40e: Fix pre-set max number of queues for VF

After setting pre-set combined to 16 queues and reserving 16 queues by
tc qdisc, pre-set maximum combined queues returned to default value
after VF reset being 4 and this generated errors during removing tc.
Fixed by removing clear num_req_queues before reset VF.
