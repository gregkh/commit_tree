media: allegro: correctly scale the bit rate in SPS

The bit rate in the SPS can be scaled by an exponent, which allows to
reduce the number of bits in the SPS in case of high bit rates.

The driver did not scale the bitrate, but used a scaling exponent of 0.
Fix this by properly calculating the scaling factor and writing the bit
rate as value and scaling factor into the SPS.
