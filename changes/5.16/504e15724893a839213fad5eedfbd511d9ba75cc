net/mlx5: Allow skipping counter refresh on creation

CT creates a counter for each CT rule, and for each such counter,
fs_counters tries to queue mlx5_fc_stats_work() work again via
mod_delayed_work(0) call to refresh all counters. This call has a
large performance impact when reaching high insertion rate and
accounts for ~8% of the insertion time when using software steering.

Allow skipping the refresh of all counters during counter creation.
Change CT to use this refresh skipping for it's counters.
