bpf: Replace "want address" users of BPF_CAST_CALL with BPF_CALL_IMM

In order to keep ahead of cases in the kernel where Control Flow
Integrity (CFI) may trip over function call casts, enabling
-Wcast-function-type is helpful. To that end, BPF_CAST_CALL causes
various warnings and is one of the last places in the kernel triggering
this warning.

Most places using BPF_CAST_CALL actually just want a void * to perform
math on. It's not actually performing a call, so just use a different
helper to get the void *, by way of the new BPF_CALL_IMM() helper, which
can clean up a common copy/paste idiom as well.

This change results in no object code difference.
