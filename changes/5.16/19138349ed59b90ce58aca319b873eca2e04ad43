mm/migrate: Add folio_migrate_flags()

Turn migrate_page_states() into a wrapper around folio_migrate_flags().
Also convert two functions only called from folio_migrate_flags() to
be folio-based.  ksm_migrate_page() becomes folio_migrate_ksm() and
copy_page_owner() becomes folio_copy_owner().  folio_migrate_flags()
alone shrinks by two thirds -- 1967 bytes down to 642 bytes.
