i2c: xiic: Defer xiic_wakeup() and __xiic_start_xfer() in xiic_process()

The __xiic_start_xfer() manipulates the interrupt flags, xiic_wakeup()
may result in return from xiic_xfer() early. Defer both to the end of
the xiic_process() interrupt thread, so that they are executed after
all the other interrupt bits handling completed and once it completely
safe to perform changes to the interrupt bits in the hardware.
