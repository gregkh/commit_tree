Revert "soc: imx: gpcv2: move reset assert after requesting domain power up"

This reverts commit a77ebdd9f553. It turns out that the VPU domain has no
different requirements, even though the downstream ATF implementation seems
to suggest otherwise. Powering on the domain with the reset asserted works
fine. As the changed sequence has caused sporadic issues with the GPU
domains, just revert the change to go back to the working sequence.
