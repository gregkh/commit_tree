platform/x86: hp-wmi: add support for omen laptops

This patch adds support for HP Omen laptops.
It adds support for most things that can be controlled via the
Windows Omen Command Center application.

 - Fan speed monitoring through hwmon
 - Platform Profile support (cool, balanced, performance)
 - Max fan speed function toggle

Also exposes the existing HDD temperature through hwmon since
this driver didn't use hwmon before this patch.

This patch has been tested on a 2020 HP Omen 15 (AMD) 15-en0023dx.

 - V1
   Initial Patch
 - V2
   Use standard hwmon ABI attributes
   Add existing non-standard "hddtemp" to hwmon
 - V3
   Fix overflow issue in "hp_wmi_get_fan_speed"
   Map max fan speed value back to hwmon values on read
   Code style fixes
   Fix issue with returning values from "hp_wmi_hwmon_read",
   the value to return should be written to val and not just
   returned from the function
 - V4
   Use DMI Board names to detect if a device should use the omen
   specific thermal profile method.
   Select HWMON instead of depending on it.
   Code style fixes.
   Replace some error codes with more specific/meaningful ones.
   Remove the HDD temperature from HWMON since we don't know what
   unit it's expressed in.
   Handle error from hp_wmi_hwmon_init
 - V5
   Handle possible NULL from dmi_get_system_info()
   Use match_string function instead of manually checking
   Directly use is_omen_thermal_profile() without the static
   variable.
