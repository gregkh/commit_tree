ALSA: hda: hdac_stream: fix potential locking issue in snd_hdac_stream_assign()

The fields 'opened', 'running', 'assigned_key' are all protected by a
spinlock, but the spinlock is not taken when looking for a
stream. This can result in a possible race between assign() and
release().

Fix by taking the spinlock before walking through the bus stream list.
