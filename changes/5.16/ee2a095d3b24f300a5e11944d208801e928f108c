ceph: initialize pathlen variable in reconnect_caps_cb

The smatch static checker warned about an uninitialized symbol usage in
this function, in the case where ceph_mdsc_build_path returns an error.

It turns out that that case is harmless, but it just looks sketchy.
Initialize the variable at declaration time, and remove the unneeded
setting of it later.
