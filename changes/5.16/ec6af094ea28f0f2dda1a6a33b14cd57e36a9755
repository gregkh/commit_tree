net/packet: rx_owner_map depends on pg_vec

Packet sockets may switch ring versions. Avoid misinterpreting state
between versions, whose fields share a union. rx_owner_map is only
allocated with a packet ring (pg_vec) and both are swapped together.
If pg_vec is NULL, meaning no packet ring was allocated, then neither
was rx_owner_map. And the field may be old state from a tpacket_v3.
