arm64: dts: allwinner: NanoPi R1S H5: Add generic compatible string for I2C EEPROM

The 'microchip,24c02' compatible does not match the at24 driver, so
add this generic fallback to the device node compatible string to
make the device to match the driver using the OF device ID table.

Also set this eeprom to read-only mode because it stores the mac
address of the onboard usb network card.
