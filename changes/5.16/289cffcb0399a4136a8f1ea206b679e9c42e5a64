btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context

Since commit 75b463d2b47aef ("btrfs: do not commit logs and transactions
during link and rename operations"), we always pass a non-NULL log context
to btrfs_log_inode_parent() and therefore to all the functions that it
calls. So remove the checks we have all over the place that test for a
NULL log context, making the code shorter and easier to read, as well as
reducing the size of the generated code.

This patch is part of a patch set comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: check if a log tree exists at inode_logged()
  btrfs: remove no longer needed checks for NULL log context
  btrfs: do not log new dentries when logging that a new name exists
  btrfs: always update the logged transaction when logging new names
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when dropping inode items from log
  btrfs: add helper to truncate inode items when logging inode
  btrfs: avoid expensive search when truncating inode items from the log
  btrfs: avoid search for logged i_size when logging inode if possible
  btrfs: avoid attempt to drop extents when logging inode for the first time
  btrfs: do not commit delayed inode when logging a file in full sync mode

This is patch 2/10 and test results are listed in the change log of the
last patch in the set.
