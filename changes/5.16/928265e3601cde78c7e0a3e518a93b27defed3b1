PM: sleep: Do not let "syscore" devices runtime-suspend during system transitions

There is no reason to allow "syscore" devices to runtime-suspend
during system-wide PM transitions, because they are subject to the
same possible failure modes as any other devices in that respect.

Accordingly, change device_prepare() and device_complete() to call
pm_runtime_get_noresume() and pm_runtime_put(), respectively, for
"syscore" devices too.
