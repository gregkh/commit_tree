ice: Allow changing lan_en and lb_en on all kinds of filters

There is no way to change default lan_en and lb_en flags while
adding new rule. Add function that allows changing these flags
on rule determined by rule id and recipe id.

Function checks if the rule is presented on regular rules list or
advance rules list and call the appropriate function to update
rule entry.

As rules with ICE_SW_LKUP_DFLT recipe aren't tracked in a list,
implement function which updates flags without searching for rules
based only on rule id.
