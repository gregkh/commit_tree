drm/amdgpu: revert "Add autodump debugfs node for gpu reset v8"

This reverts commit 728e7e0cd61899208e924472b9e641dbeb0775c4.

Further discussion reveals that this feature is severely broken
and needs to be reverted ASAP.

GPU reset can never be delayed by userspace even for debugging or
otherwise we can run into in kernel deadlocks.
