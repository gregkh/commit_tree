userfaultfd/selftests: fix feature support detection

Before any tests are run, in set_test_type, we decide what feature(s) we
are going to be testing, based upon our command line arguments.
However, the supported features are not just a function of the memory
type being used, so this is broken.

For instance, consider writeprotect support.  It is "normally" supported
for anonymous memory, but furthermore it requires that the kernel has
CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_USERFAULTFD_WP.  So, it is *not* supported at all on
aarch64, for example.

So, this fixes this by querying the kernel for the set of features it
supports in set_test_type, by opening a userfaultfd and issuing a
UFFDIO_API ioctl.  Based upon the reported features, we toggle what
tests are enabled.
