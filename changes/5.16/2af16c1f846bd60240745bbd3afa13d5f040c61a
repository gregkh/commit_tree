HID: nintendo: add nintendo switch controller driver

The hid-nintendo driver supports the Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers and
the Joy-Cons. The Pro Controllers can be used over USB or Bluetooth.

The Joy-Cons each create their own, independent input devices, so it is
up to userspace to combine them if desired.
