ASoC: SOF: Change SND_SOC_SOF_TOPLEVEL from config to menuconfig

We have growing number of options under SND_SOC_SOF_TOPLEVEL as SOF
adaptation is growing (Intel, NXP, AMD and Mediatek) and new features are
added.
It will make the menuconfig user experience much cleaner if we move the
SOF options under a separate page.
