checkpatch: get default codespell dictionary path from package location

The standard location of dictionary.txt is under codespell's package, on
my machine atm (codespell 2.1, Artix Linux):

  /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/codespell_lib/data/dictionary.txt

Since we enable the codespell by default for SOF I have constant:

  No codespell typos will be found - file '/usr/share/codespell/dictionary.txt': No such file or directory

The patch proposes to try to fix up the path following the
recommendation found here:
