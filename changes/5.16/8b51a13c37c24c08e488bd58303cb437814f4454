ice: xsk: do not clear status_error0 for ntu + nb_buffs descriptor

The descriptor that ntu is pointing at when we exit
ice_alloc_rx_bufs_zc() should not have its corresponding DD bit cleared
as descriptor is not allocated in there and it is not valid for HW
usage.

The allocation routine at the entry will fill the descriptor that ntu
points to after it was set to ntu + nb_buffs on previous call.

Even the spec says:
"The tail pointer should be set to one descriptor beyond the last empty
descriptor in host descriptor ring."

Therefore, step away from clearing the status_error0 on ntu + nb_buffs
descriptor.
