Bluetooth: Make use of hci_{suspend,resume}_dev on suspend notifier

This moves code from hci_suspend_notifier to hci_{suspend,resume}_dev
since some driver may handle pm directly using
HCI_QUIRK_NO_SUSPEND_NOTIFIER they would instead call
hci_{suspend,resume}_dev directly and we want that to have the same
behavior regardless of where pm is being handled.
