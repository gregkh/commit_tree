KVM: selftests: Fill per-vCPU struct during "perf_test" VM creation

Fill the per-vCPU args when creating the perf_test VM instead of having
the caller do so.  This helps ensure that any adjustments to the number
of pages (and thus vcpu_memory_bytes) are reflected in the per-VM args.
Automatically filling the per-vCPU args will also allow a future patch
to do the sync to the guest during creation.
