ice: Fix problems with DSCP QoS implementation

The patch that implemented DSCP QoS implementation removed a
bandwidth check that was used to check for a specific condition
caused by some corner cases.  This check should not of been
removed.

The same patch also added a check for when the DCBx state could
be changed in relation to DSCP, but the check was erroneously
added nested in a check for CEE mode, which made the check useless.

Fix these problems by re-adding the bandwidth check and relocating
the DSCP mode check earlier in the function that changes DCBx state
in the driver.
