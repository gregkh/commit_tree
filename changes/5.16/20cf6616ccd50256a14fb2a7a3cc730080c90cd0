Drivers: hv: vmbus: Remove unused code to check for subchannels

The last caller of vmbus_are_subchannels_present() was removed in commit
c967590457ca ("scsi: storvsc: Fix a race in sub-channel creation that can cause panic").

Remove this dead code, and the utility function invoke_sc_cb() that it is
the only caller of.
