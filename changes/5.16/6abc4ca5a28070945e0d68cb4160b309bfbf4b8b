ARM: BCM53016: Specify switch ports for Meraki MR32

the switch identifies itself as a BCM53012 (rev 5)...
This patch has been tested & verified on OpenWrt's
snapshot with Linux 5.10 (didn't test any older kernels).
The MR32 is able to "talk to the network" as before with
OpenWrt's SWITCHDEV b53 driver.
