drm/i915: Remove warning from the rps worker

In commit 4e5c8a99e1cb ("drm/i915: Drop i915_request.lock requirement
for intel_rps_boost()"), we decoupled the rps worker from the pm so
that we could avoid the synchronization penalty which makes the
assertion liable to run too early. Which makes warning invalid hence
removed.
