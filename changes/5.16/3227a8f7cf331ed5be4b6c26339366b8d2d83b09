media: venus: Handle fatal errors during encoding and decoding

According to stateful decoder docs a fatal failure of decoding
(and encoding) could be recover it by closing the corresponding
file handle and open new one or reinitialize decoding (and encoding)
by stop streaming on both queues. In order to satisfy this
requirement we add a mechanism ins sys_error_handler and
corresponding decoder and encoder drivers to wait for sys_error_done
waitqueue in reqbuf.
