staging: r8188eu: Fix breakage introduced when 5G code was removed

In commit 221abd4d478a ("staging: r8188eu: Remove no more necessary definitions
and code"), two entries were removed from RTW_ChannelPlanMap[], but not replaced
with zeros. The position within this table is important, thus the patch broke
systems operating in regulatory domains osted later than entry 0x13 in the table.
Unfortunately, the FCC entry comes before that point and most testers did not see
this problem.
