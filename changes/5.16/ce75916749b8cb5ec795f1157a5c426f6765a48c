KVM: arm64: pkvm: Use a single function to expose all id-regs

Rather than exposing a whole set of helper functions to retrieve
individual ID registers, use the existing decoding tree and expose
a single helper instead.

This allow a number of functions to be made static, and we now
have a single entry point to maintain.
