um/drivers/ubd_kern: add error handling support for add_disk()

We never checked for errors on add_disk() as this function
returned void. Now that this is fixed, use the shiny new
error handling.

ubd_disk_register() never returned an error, so just fix
that now and let the caller handle the error condition.
