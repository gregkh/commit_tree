MAINTAINERS: rectify entry for CHIPONE ICN8318 I2C TOUCHSCREEN DRIVER

Commit 04647773d648 ("dt-bindings: input: Convert ChipOne ICN8318
binding to a schema") converts chipone_icn8318.txt to chipone,icn8318.yaml,
but missed to adjust its reference in MAINTAINERS.

Hence, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains about
a broken reference.

Repair this file reference in CHIPONE ICN8318 I2C TOUCHSCREEN DRIVER.
