ath10k: fix division by zero in send path

Add the missing endpoint max-packet sanity check to probe() to avoid
division by zero in ath10k_usb_hif_tx_sg() in case a malicious device
has broken descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).

Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero
wMaxPacketSize but that drivers doing packet-size calculations still
need to handle this (cf. commit 2548288b4fb0 ("USB: Fix: Don't skip
endpoint descriptors with maxpacket=0")).
