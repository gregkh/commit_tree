libbpf: Remove Makefile warnings on out-of-sync netlink.h/if_link.h

Although relying on some definitions from the netlink.h and if_link.h
headers copied into tools/include/uapi/linux/, libbpf does not need
those headers to stay entirely up-to-date with their original versions,
and the warnings emitted by the Makefile when it detects a difference
are usually just noise. Let's remove those warnings.
