memory: mtk-smi: Adjust some code position

No functional change. Only move the code position to make the code more
readable.
1. Put the register smi-common above smi-larb. Prepare to add some others
   register setting.
2. Put mtk_smi_larb_unbind around larb_bind.
3. Sort the SoC data alphabetically. and put them in one line as the
   current kernel allow it.
