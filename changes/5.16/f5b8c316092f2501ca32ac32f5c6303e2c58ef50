drm/i915: Reject user modes that don't match fixed mode's refresh rate

When using a panel with a fixed mode we don't change the refresh
rate of the display. Reject any user requested mode which doesn't
match that fixed refresh rate.

Unfortunately when Xorg sees the scaling_mode property on the
connecor it likes to automagically cook up modes whose refresh
rate is a fair bit off from the fixed refresh rate we use. So
we have to give it some extra latitude so that we don't start to
reject all of it.

v2: sDVO now uses intel_panel_compute_config() too
v3: Add a debug message to inform the user what happened
