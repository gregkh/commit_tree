KVM: x86/mmu: clean up prefetch/prefault/speculative naming

"prefetch", "prefault" and "speculative" are used throughout KVM to mean
the same thing.  Use a single name, standardizing on "prefetch" which
is already used by various functions such as direct_pte_prefetch,
FNAME(prefetch_gpte), FNAME(pte_prefetch), etc.
