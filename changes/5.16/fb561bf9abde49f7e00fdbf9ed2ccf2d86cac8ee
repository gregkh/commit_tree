fbdev: Prevent probing generic drivers if a FB is already registered

The efifb and simplefb drivers just render to a pre-allocated frame buffer
and rely on the display hardware being initialized before the kernel boots.

But if another driver already probed correctly and registered a fbdev, the
generic drivers shouldn't be probed since an actual driver for the display
hardware is already present.

This is more likely to occur after commit d391c5827107 ("drivers/firmware:
move x86 Generic System Framebuffers support") since the "efi-framebuffer"
and "simple-framebuffer" platform devices are registered at a later time.
