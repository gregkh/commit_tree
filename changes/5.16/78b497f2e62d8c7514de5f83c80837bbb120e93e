kvm: use kvfree() in kvm_arch_free_vm()

By switching from kfree() to kvfree() in kvm_arch_free_vm() Arm64 can
use the common variant. This can be accomplished by adding another
macro __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_VM_FREE, which will be used only by x86 for now.

Further simplification can be achieved by adding __kvm_arch_free_vm()
doing the common part.
