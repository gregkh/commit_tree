net: make napi_disable() symmetric with enable

Commit 3765996e4f0b ("napi: fix race inside napi_enable") fixed
an ordering bug in napi_enable() and made the napi_enable() diverge
from napi_disable(). The state transitions done on disable are
not symmetric to enable.

There is no known bug in napi_disable() this is just refactoring.

Eric suggests we can also replace msleep(1) with a more opportunistic
usleep_range().
