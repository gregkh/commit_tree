drm/i915: Stop using I915_TILING_* in client blit selftest

The I915_TILING_* definitions in the uapi header are intended solely for
tiling modes that are visible to the old de-tiling fence ioctls.  Since
modern hardware does not support de-tiling fences, we should not add new
definitions for new tiling types going forward.  However we do want the
client blit selftest to eventually cover other new tiling modes (such as
Tile4), so switch it to using its own enum of tiling modes.
