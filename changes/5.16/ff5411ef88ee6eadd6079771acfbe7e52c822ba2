ice: manage VSI antispoof and destination override

Implement functions to make setting VSI security config easier.
Main function ice_update_security fills security section field and
checks against error in updating VSI. Reset functions are responsible
for correct filling config according to user expectations.

This helper is needed because destination override is located in
this section. Driver has to set this bit to allow strering Tx packet
on VSI based on value in Tx descriptors.
