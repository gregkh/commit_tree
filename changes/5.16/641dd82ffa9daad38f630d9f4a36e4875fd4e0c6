drm/i915/display/adlp: Add new PSR2 workarounds

Wa_16014451276 fixes the starting coordinate for PSR2 selective
updates. CHICKEN_TRANS definition of the workaround bit has a wrong
name based on workaround definition and HSD.

Wa_14014971508 allows the screen to continue to be updated when
coming back from DC5/DC6 and SF_SINGLE_FULL_FRAME bit is not kept
set in PSR2_MAN_TRK_CTL.

Wa_16012604467 fixes underruns when exiting PSR2 when it is in one
of its internal states.

Wa_14014971508 is still in pending status in BSpec but by
the time this is reviewed and ready to be merged it will be finalized.

v2:
- renamed register to ADLP_1_BASED_X_GRANULARITY
- added comment about all ADL-P supported panels being 1 based X
granularity
