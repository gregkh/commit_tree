btrfs: remove btrfs_bio_alloc() helper

The helper btrfs_bio_alloc() is almost the same as btrfs_io_bio_alloc(),
except it's allocating using BIO_MAX_VECS as @nr_iovecs, and initializes
bio->bi_iter.bi_sector.

However the naming itself is not using "btrfs_io_bio" to indicate its
parameter is "strcut btrfs_io_bio" and can be easily confused with
"struct btrfs_bio".

Considering assigned bio->bi_iter.bi_sector is such a simple work and
there are already tons of call sites doing that manually, there is no
need to do that in a helper.

Remove btrfs_bio_alloc() helper, and enhance btrfs_io_bio_alloc()
function to provide a fail-safe value for its @nr_iovecs.

And then replace all btrfs_bio_alloc() callers with
btrfs_io_bio_alloc().
