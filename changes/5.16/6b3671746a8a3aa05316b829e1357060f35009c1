net/mlx5: remove the recent devlink params

revert commit 46ae40b94d88 ("net/mlx5: Let user configure io_eq_size param")
revert commit a6cb08daa3b4 ("net/mlx5: Let user configure event_eq_size param")
revert commit 554604061979 ("net/mlx5: Let user configure max_macs param")

The EQE parameters are applicable to more drivers, they should
be configured via standard API, probably ethtool. Example of
another driver needing something similar:

The last param for "max_macs" is probably fine but the documentation
is severely lacking. The meaning and implications for changing the
param need to be stated.
