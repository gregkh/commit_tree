rtmutex: Check explicit for TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT.

rt_mutex_wake_q_add() needs to  need to distiguish between sleeping
locks (TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT) and normal locks which use TASK_NORMAL to use
the proper wake mechanism.

Instead of checking for != TASK_NORMAL make it more robust and check
explicit for TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT which is the reason why a different wake
mechanism is used.

No functional change.
