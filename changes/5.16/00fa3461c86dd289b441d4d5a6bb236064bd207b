irqchip/mchp-eic: Add support for the Microchip EIC

Add support for Microchip External Interrupt Controller. The controller
supports 2 external interrupt lines. For every external input there is
a connection to GIC. The interrupt controllers contains only 4
registers:
- EIC_GFCS (read only): which indicates that glitch filter configuration
  is ready (not addressed in this implementation)
- EIC_SCFG0R, EIC_SCFG1R (read, write): allows per interrupt specific
  settings: enable, polarity/edge settings, glitch filter settings
- EIC_WPMR, EIC_WPSR: enables write protection mode specific settings
  (which are architecture specific) for the controller and are not
  addressed in this implementation
