ata: ahci: Add Green Sardine vendor ID as board_ahci_mobile

AMD requires that the SATA controller be configured for devsleep in order
for S0i3 entry to work properly.

commit b1a9585cc396 ("ata: ahci: Enable DEVSLP by default on x86 with
SLP_S0") sets up a kernel policy to enable devsleep on Intel mobile
platforms that are using s0ix.  Add the PCI ID for the SATA controller in
Green Sardine platforms to extend this policy by default for AMD based
systems using s0i3 as well.
