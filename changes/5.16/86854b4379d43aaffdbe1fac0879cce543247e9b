driver core: platform: Make use of the helper macro SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS()

Use the helper macro SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS() instead of the verbose
operators ".runtime_suspend/.runtime_resume", because the
SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS() is a nice helper macro that could be brought
in to make code a little clearer, a little more concise.
