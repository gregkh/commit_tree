btrfs: add additional parameters to btrfs_init_tree_ref/btrfs_init_data_ref

In order to make 'real_root' used only in ref-verify it's required to
have the necessary context to perform the same checks that this member
is used for. So add 'mod_root' which will contain the root on behalf of
which a delayed ref was created and a 'skip_group' parameter which
will contain callsite-specific override of skip_qgroup.
