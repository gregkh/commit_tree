ALSA: hda/realtek: Add new alc285-hp-amp-init model

Adds a new "alc285-hp-amp-init" model that can be used to apply the ALC285
HP speaker amplifier initialization fixup to devices that are not already
known by passing "hda_model=alc285-hp-amp-init" to the
snd-sof-intel-hda-common module or "model=alc285-hp-amp-init" to the
snd-hda-intel module, depending on which is being used.
