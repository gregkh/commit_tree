regulator: lp872x: Remove lp872x_dvs_state

After this driver was converted to gpiod, clang started warning:

vers/regulator/lp872x.c:689:57: error: implicit conversion from
enumeration type 'enum lp872x_dvs_state' to different enumeration type
'enum gpiod_flags' [-Werror,-Wenum-conversion]
        dvs->gpio = devm_gpiod_get_optional(lp->dev, "ti,dvs", pinstate);
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                    ^~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

lp872x_dvs_state was updated to have values from gpiod_flags but this is
not enough to avoid an implicit conversion warning from either GCC or
clang (although GCC enables this warning under -Wextra instead of -Wall
like clang so it is not seen under normal builds).

Eliminate lp872x_dvs_state in favor of using gpiod_flags everywhere so
that there is no more warning about an implicit conversion.
