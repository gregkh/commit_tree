block/mq-deadline: Improve request accounting further

The scheduler .insert_requests() callback is called when a request is
queued for the first time and also when it is requeued. Only count a
request the first time it is queued. Additionally, since the mq-deadline
scheduler only performs zone locking for requests that have been
inserted, skip the zone unlock code for requests that have not been
inserted into the mq-deadline scheduler.
