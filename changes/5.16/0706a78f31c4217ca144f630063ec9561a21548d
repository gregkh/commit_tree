Revert "xsk: Do not sleep in poll() when need_wakeup set"

This reverts commit bd0687c18e635b63233dc87f38058cd728802ab4.

This patch causes a Tx only workload to go to sleep even when it does
not have to, leading to misserable performance in skb mode. It fixed
one rare problem but created a much worse one, so this need to be
reverted while I try to craft a proper solution to the original
problem.
