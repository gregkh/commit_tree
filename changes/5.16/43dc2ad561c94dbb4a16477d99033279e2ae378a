drm/amd/display: Fix MST link encoder availability check.

[Why]
MST streams share the same link and should share the same encoder.
The current availability check may erroneously determine that an
encoder is unavailable for MST streams.

[How]
When checking for link encoder availability, check if an encoder
in use shares a link with the stream for which the availability
check is being conducted. If the link is shared, then the link
encoder should be shared too and will be deemed available.
