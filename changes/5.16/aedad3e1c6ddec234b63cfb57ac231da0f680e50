arm64: mte: change PR_MTE_TCF_NONE back into an unsigned long

This constant was previously an unsigned long, but was changed
into an int in commit 433c38f40f6a ("arm64: mte: change ASYNC and
SYNC TCF settings into bitfields"). This ended up causing spurious
unsigned-signed comparison warnings in expressions such as:

(x & PR_MTE_TCF_MASK) != PR_MTE_TCF_NONE

Therefore, change it back into an unsigned long to silence these
warnings.
