tcp: adjust sndbuf according to sk_reserved_mem

If user sets SO_RESERVE_MEM socket option, in order to fully utilize the
reserved memory in memory pressure state on the tx path, we modify the
logic in sk_stream_moderate_sndbuf() to set sk_sndbuf according to
available reserved memory, instead of MIN_SOCK_SNDBUF, and adjust it
when new data is acked.
