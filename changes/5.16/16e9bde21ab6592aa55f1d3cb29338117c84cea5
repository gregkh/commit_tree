memstick: jmb38x_ms: Prefer struct_size over open coded arithmetic

As noted in the "Deprecated Interfaces, Language Features, Attributes,
and Conventions" documentation [1], size calculations (especially
multiplication) should not be performed in memory allocator (or similar)
function arguments due to the risk of them overflowing. This could lead
to values wrapping around and a smaller allocation being made than the
caller was expecting. Using those allocations could lead to linear
overflows of heap memory and other misbehaviors.

So, use the struct_size() helper to do the arithmetic instead of the
argument "size + count * size" in the kzalloc() function.
