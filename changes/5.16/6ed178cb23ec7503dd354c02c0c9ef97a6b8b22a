staging: use eth_hw_addr_set()

Commit 406f42fa0d3c ("net-next: When a bond have a massive amount
of VLANs...") introduced a rbtree for faster Ethernet address look
up. To maintain netdev->dev_addr in this tree we need to make all
the writes to it got through appropriate helpers.

Convert staging drivers from memcpy(... ETH_ADDR) to eth_hw_addr_set():
