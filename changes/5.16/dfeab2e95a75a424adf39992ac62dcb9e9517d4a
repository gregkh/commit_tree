erofs: add multiple device support

In order to support multi-layer container images, add multiple
device feature to EROFS. Two ways are available to use for now:

 - Devices can be mapped into 32-bit global block address space;
 - Device ID can be specified with the chunk indexes format.

Note that it assumes no extent would cross device boundary and mkfs
should take care of it seriously.

In the future, a dedicated device manager could be introduced then
thus extra devices can be automatically scanned by UUID as well.
