scsi: lpfc: Revert LOG_TRACE_EVENT back to LOG_INIT prior to driver_resource_setup()

In cases when lpfc_enable_pci_dev() fails, lpfc_printf_log() with
LOG_TRACE_EVENT set will call lpfc_dmp_dbg() which uses the
phba->port_list_lock.

However, phba->port_list_lock does not get initialized until
lpfc_setup_driver_resource_phase1().  Thus, any initialization routine with
LOG_TRACE_EVENT log message prior to lpfc_setup_driver_resource_phase1()
will crash.

Revert LOG_TRACE_EVENT back to LOG_INIT for all log messages in routines
prior to lpfc_setup_driver_resource_phase1().
