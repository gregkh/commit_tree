ASoC: SOF: compress: move and export sof_probe_compr_ops

sof_probe_compr_ops are not platform-specific. So move
it to common compress code and export the symbol. The
compilation of the common compress code is already dependent
on the selection of CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG_PROBES, so no
need to check the Kconfig section for defining sof_probe_compr_ops
again.
