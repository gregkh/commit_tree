ice: introduce new type of VSI for switchdev

New type of VSI has to be defined for switchdev control plane
VSI. Number of allocated Tx and Rx queue has to be equal to
amount of VFs, because each port representor should have one
Tx and Rx queue.

Also to not increase number of used irqs too much, control plane
VSI uses only one q_vector and handle all queues in one irq.
To allow handling all queues in one irq , new function to clean
msix for eswitch was introduced. This function will schedule napi
for each representor instead of scheduling it only for one like in
normal clean irq function.

Only one additional msix has to be requested. Always try to request
it in ice_ena_msix_range function.
