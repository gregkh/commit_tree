ASoC: SOF: topology: allow for dynamic pipelines override for debug

For debug and community support, it's useful to expose a kernel
parameter to prevent the use of dynamic pipelines exposed in a
topology file, or conversely to force an existing topology to use
dynamic pipelines.

Add an override bit and an enable bit which is valid only when the
override is set.

For products, the intent is that the topology file defines the
behavior, these two bits are only intended for diagnosis and
performance checks.
