mlxsw: spectrum_ipip: Add mlxsw_sp_ipip_gre6_ops

Add operations for IP-in-IP GRE6. For now the function can_offload()
returns false and the other functions warn as they should never be called.

A later patch will add dedicated operations for Spectrum-2 which will
support IPv6 underlay, so use 'mlxsw_sp1_' prefix for the new operations.
