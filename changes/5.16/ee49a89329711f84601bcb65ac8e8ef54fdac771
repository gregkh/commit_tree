KVM: x86: Move SVM's APICv sanity check to common x86

Move SVM's assertion that vCPU's APICv state is consistent with its VM's
state out of svm_vcpu_run() and into x86's common inner run loop.  The
assertion and underlying logic is not unique to SVM, it's just that SVM
has more inhibiting conditions and thus is more likely to run headfirst
into any KVM bugs.

Add relevant comments to document exactly why the update path has unusual
ordering between the update the kick, why said ordering is safe, and also
the basic rules behind the assertion in the run loop.
