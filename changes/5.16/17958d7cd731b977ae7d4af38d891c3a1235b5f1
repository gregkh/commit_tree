net/mlx5e: Fix interoperability between XSK and ICOSQ recovery flow

Both regular RQ and XSKRQ use the same ICOSQ for UMRs. When doing
recovery for the ICOSQ, don't forget to deactivate XSKRQ.

XSK can be opened and closed while channels are active, so a new mutex
prevents the ICOSQ recovery from running at the same time. The ICOSQ
recovery deactivates and reactivates XSKRQ, so any parallel change in
XSK state would break consistency. As the regular RQ is running, it's
not enough to just flush the recovery work, because it can be
rescheduled.
