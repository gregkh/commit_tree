bus: ti-sysc: Fix timekeeping_suspended warning on resume

On resume we can get a warning at kernel/time/timekeeping.c:824 for
timekeeping_suspended.

Let's fix this by adding separate functions for sysc_poll_reset_sysstatus()
and sysc_poll_reset_sysconfig() and have the new functions handle also
timekeeping_suspended.

If iopoll at some point supports timekeeping_suspended, we can just drop
the custom handling from these functions.
