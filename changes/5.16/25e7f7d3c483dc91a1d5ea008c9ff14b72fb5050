media: mtk-vcodec: vdec: clamp OUTPUT resolution to hardware limits

Calling S_FMT or TRY_FMT on the OUTPUT queue should adjust the
resolution to the limits supported by the hardware. Until now this was
only done on the CAPTURE queue, which could make clients believe that
unsupported resolutions can be used when they set the coded size on the
OUTPUT queue.

In the case of the stateless decoder, the problem was even bigger since
subsequently calling G_FMT on the CAPTURE queue would result in the
unclamped resolution being returned, further inducing the client into
error.
