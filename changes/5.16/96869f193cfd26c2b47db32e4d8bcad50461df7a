net/mlx5: Set devlink reload feature bit for supported devices only

Mulitport slave device doesn't support devlink reload, so instead of
complicating initialization flow with devlink_reload_enable() which
will be removed in next patch, don't set DEVLINK_F_RELOAD feature bit
for such devices.

This fixes an error when reload counters exposed (and equal zero) for
the mode that is not supported at all.
