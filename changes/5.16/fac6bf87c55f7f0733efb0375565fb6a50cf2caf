usb: dwc2: fix STM ID/VBUS detection startup delay in dwc2_driver_probe

When activate_stm_id_vb_detection is enabled, ID and Vbus detection relies
on sensing comparators. This detection needs time to stabilize.
A delay was already applied in dwc2_resume() when reactivating the
detection, but it wasn't done in dwc2_probe().
This patch adds delay after enabling STM ID/VBUS detection. Then, ID state
is good when initializing gadget and host, and avoid to get a wrong
Connector ID Status Change interrupt.
