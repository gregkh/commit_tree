arm64/traps: Avoid unnecessary kernel/user pointer conversion

Annotating a pointer from kernel to __user and then back again requires
an extra __force annotation to silent sparse warning. In call_undef_hook()
this unnecessary complexity can be avoided by modifying the intermediate
user pointer to unsigned long.

This way there is no inter-changeable use of user and kernel pointers
and the code is consistent.

Note: This patch adds no functional changes to code.
