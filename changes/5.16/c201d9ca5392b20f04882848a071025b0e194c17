xfs: rename xfs_bmap_add_free to xfs_free_extent_later

xfs_bmap_add_free isn't a block mapping function; it schedules deferred
freeing operations for a later point in a compound transaction chain.
While it's primarily used by bunmapi, its use has expanded beyond that.
Move it to xfs_alloc.c and rename the function since it's now general
freeing functionality.  Bring the slab cache bits in line with the
way we handle the other intent items.
