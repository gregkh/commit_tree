x86/xen: Move hypercall_page to top of the file

Because hypercall_page is page-aligned, the assembler inexplicably adds
an unreachable jump from after the end of the previous code to the
beginning of hypercall_page.

That confuses objtool, understandably.  It also creates significant text
fragmentation.  As a result, much of the object file is wasted text
(nops).

Move hypercall_page to the beginning of the file to both prevent the
text fragmentation and avoid the dead jump instruction.
