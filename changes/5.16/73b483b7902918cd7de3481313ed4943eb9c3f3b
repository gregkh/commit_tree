ice: Manage act flags for switchdev offloads

Currently it is not possible to set/unset lb_en and lan_en flags
for advanced rules during their creation. Both flags are enabled
by default. In case of switchdev offloads for egress traffic we
need lb_en to be disabled. Because of that, we work around it by
updating the rule immediately after its creation.

This change allows us to set/unset those flags right away and it
gets rid of old workaround as well. Using ice_adv_rule_flags_info
structure we can pass info about flags we want to be set for
a given advanced rule. Flags are stored in flags_info.act.
Values from act would be used only if act_valid was set to true,
otherwise default values would be used.
