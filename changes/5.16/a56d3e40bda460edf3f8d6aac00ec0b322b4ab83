comedi: vmk80xx: fix bulk and interrupt message timeouts

USB bulk and interrupt message timeouts are specified in milliseconds
and should specifically not vary with CONFIG_HZ.

Note that the bulk-out transfer timeout was set to the endpoint
bInterval value, which should be ignored for bulk endpoints and is
typically set to zero. This meant that a failing bulk-out transfer
would never time out.

Assume that the 10 second timeout used for all other transfers is more
than enough also for the bulk-out endpoint.
