block: remove some blk_mq_hw_ctx debugfs entries

Just like the blk_mq_ctx counterparts, we've got a bunch of counters
in here that are only for debugfs and are of questionnable value. They
are:

- dispatched, index of how many requests were dispatched in one go

- poll_{considered,invoked,success}, which track poll sucess rates. We're
  confident in the iopoll implementation at this point, don't bother
  tracking these.

As a bonus, this shrinks each hardware queue from 576 bytes to 512 bytes,
dropping a whole cacheline.
