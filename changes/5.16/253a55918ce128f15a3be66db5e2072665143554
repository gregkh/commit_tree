drm/amd/display: Fix issue with dynamic bpp change for DCN3x

Why:
Screen sometimes would have artifacts or blink once at the time when bpp
is dynamically changed.

How:
1. Changed to update PPS infopacket in frame mode instead of immediate mode
   since other updates for bpp change are double-buffered.
2. Changed double-buffering enablement programming for DCN30 as advised by
ASIC team
