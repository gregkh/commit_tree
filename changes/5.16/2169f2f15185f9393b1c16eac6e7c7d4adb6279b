ASoC: wm_adsp: Pass firmware names as parameters when starting DSP core

As preparation for moving the generic DSP support out of ASoC pass the
firmware names used when loading files as parameters as the generic code
can't refer directly to the array specific to wm_adsp. The code
remaining in wm_adsp.c doesn't need to change, it can continue to use
the string arrays directly.
