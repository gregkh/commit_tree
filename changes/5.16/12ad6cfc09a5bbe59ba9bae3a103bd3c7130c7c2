x86/xen: remove xen_have_vcpu_info_placement flag

The flag xen_have_vcpu_info_placement was needed to support Xen
hypervisors older than version 3.4, which didn't support the
VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info hypercall. Today the Linux kernel requires
at least Xen 4.0 to be able to run, so xen_have_vcpu_info_placement
can be dropped (in theory the flag was used to ensure a working kernel
even in case of the VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info hypercall failing for
other reasons than the hypercall not being supported, but the only
cases covered by the flag would be parameter errors, which ought not
to be made anyway).

This allows to let some functions return void now, as they can never
fail.
