coresight: trbe: End the AUX handle on truncation

When we detect that there isn't enough space left to start a meaningful
session, we disable the TRBE, marking the buffer as TRUNCATED. But we delay
the notification to the perf layer by perf_aux_output_end() until the event
is scheduled out, triggered from the kernel perf layer. This will cause
significant black outs in the trace. Now that the CoreSight PMU layer can
handle a closed "AUX" handle properly, we can close the handle as soon as
we detect the case, allowing the userspace to collect and re-enable the
event.

Also, while in the IRQ handler, move the irq_work_run() after we have
updated the handle, to make sure the "TRUNCATED" flag causes the event to
be disabled as soon as possible.
