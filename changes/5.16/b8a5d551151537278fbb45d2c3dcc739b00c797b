KVM: MMU: change page_fault_handle_page_track() arguments to kvm_page_fault

Add fields to struct kvm_page_fault corresponding to the arguments
of page_fault_handle_page_track().  The fields are initialized in the
callers, and page_fault_handle_page_track() receives a struct
kvm_page_fault instead of having to extract the arguments out of it.
