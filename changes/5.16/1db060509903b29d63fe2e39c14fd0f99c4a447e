drm: mxsfb: Set fallback bus format when the bridge doesn't provide one

If a bridge doesn't do any bus format handling MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED is
returned. Fallback to a reasonable default (MEDIA_BUS_FMT_RGB888_1X24) in
that case.

This unbreaks e.g. using mxsfb with the nwl bridge and mipi dsi panels.
