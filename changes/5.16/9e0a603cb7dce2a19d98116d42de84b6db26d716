i40e: Fix ping is lost after configuring ADq on VF

Properly reconfigure VF VSIs after VF request ADQ.
Created new function to update queue mapping and queue pairs per TC
with AQ update VSI. This sets proper RSS size on NIC.
VFs num_queue_pairs should not be changed during setup of queue maps.
Previously, VF main VSI in ADQ had configured too many queues and had
wrong RSS size, which lead to packets not being consumed and drops in
connectivity.
