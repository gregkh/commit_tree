ftrace/samples: add missing Kconfig option for ftrace direct multi sample

Currently it is not possible to build the ftrace direct multi example
anymore due to broken config dependencies. Fix this by adding
SAMPLE_FTRACE_DIRECT_MULTI config option.

This broke when merging s390-5.16-1 due to an incorrect merge conflict
resolution proposed by me.

Also rename SAMPLE_FTRACE_MULTI_DIRECT to SAMPLE_FTRACE_DIRECT_MULTI
so it matches the module name.
