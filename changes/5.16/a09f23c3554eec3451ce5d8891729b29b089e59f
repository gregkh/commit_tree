btrfs: rename and switch to bool btrfs_chunk_readonly

btrfs_chunk_readonly() checks if the given chunk is writeable. It
returns 1 for readonly, and 0 for writeable. So the return argument type
bool shall suffice instead of the current type int.

Also, rename btrfs_chunk_readonly() to btrfs_chunk_writeable() as we
check if the bg is writeable, and helps to keep the logic at the parent
function simpler to understand.
