dma-buf: fix and rework dma_buf_poll v7

Daniel pointed me towards this function and there are multiple obvious problems
in the implementation.

First of all the retry loop is not working as intended. In general the retry
makes only sense if you grab the reference first and then check the sequence
values.

Then we should always also wait for the exclusive fence.

It's also good practice to keep the reference around when installing callbacks
to fences you don't own.

And last the whole implementation was unnecessary complex and rather hard to
understand which could lead to probably unexpected behavior of the IOCTL.

Fix all this by reworking the implementation from scratch. Dropping the
whole RCU approach and taking the lock instead.

Only mildly tested and needs a thoughtful review of the code.

Pushing through drm-misc-next to avoid merge conflicts and give the code
another round of testing.

v2: fix the reference counting as well
v3: keep the excl fence handling as is for stable
v4: back to testing all fences, drop RCU
v5: handle in and out separately
v6: add missing clear of events
v7: change coding style as suggested by Michel, drop unused variables
