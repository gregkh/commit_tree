percpu: km: ensure it is used with NOMMU (either UP or SMP)

Currently, NOMMU pull km allocator via !SMP dependency because most of
them are UP, yet for SMP+NOMMU vm allocator gets pulled which:

* may lead to broken build [1]
* ...or not working runtime due to [2]

It looks like SMP+NOMMU case was overlooked in bbddff054587 ("percpu:
use percpu allocator on UP too") so restore that.

For ARM SMP+NOMMU (R-class cores)

mm/percpu-vm.c:188: undefined reference to `flush_tlb_kernel_range'
