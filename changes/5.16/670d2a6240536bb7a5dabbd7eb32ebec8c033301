drm/amd/display: Fix dummy p-state hang on monitors with extreme timing

[WHY]
It was found that the system would hang on a dummy pstate when playing
4k60 videos on a 1080p 390Hz monitor.

[HOW]
Properly select the dummy_pstate_latency_ms when firmware assisted
memory clock switching is enabled instead of assuming that the highest
latency would work for every monitor timing.
