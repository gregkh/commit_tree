selftests/bpf: Fix fd cleanup in sk_lookup test

Similar to the fix in commit:
e31eec77e4ab ("bpf: selftests: Fix fd cleanup in get_branch_snapshot")

We use designated initializer to set fds to -1 without breaking on
future changes to MAX_SERVER constant denoting the array size.

The particular close(0) occurs on non-reuseport tests, so it can be seen
with -n 115/{2,3} but not 115/4. This can cause problems with future
tests if they depend on BTF fd never being acquired as fd 0, breaking
internal libbpf assumptions.
