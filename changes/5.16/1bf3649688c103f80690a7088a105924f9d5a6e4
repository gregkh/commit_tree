selftests: xsk: Introduce pacing of traffic

Introduce pacing of traffic so that the Tx thread can never send more
packets than the receiver has processed plus the number of packets it
can have in its umem. So at any point in time, the number of in flight
packets (not processed by the Rx thread) are less than or equal to the
number of packets that can be held in the Rx thread's umem.

The batch size is also increased to improve running time.
