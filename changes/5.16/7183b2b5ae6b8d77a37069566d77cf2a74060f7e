KVM: arm64: Move pkvm's special 32bit handling into a generic infrastructure

Protected KVM is trying to turn AArch32 exceptions into an illegal
exception entry. Unfortunately, it does that in a way that is a bit
abrupt, and too early for PSTATE to be available.

Instead, move it to the fixup code, which is a more reasonable place
for it. This will also be useful for the NV code.
