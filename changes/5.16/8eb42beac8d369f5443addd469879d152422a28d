mm/migrate: de-duplicate migrate_reason strings

In order to remove the need to manually keep three different files in
synch, provide a common definition of the mapping between enum
migrate_reason, and the associated strings for each enum item.

1. Use the tracing system's mapping of enums to strings, by redefining
   and reusing the MIGRATE_REASON and supporting macros, and using that
   to populate the string array in mm/debug.c.

2. Move enum migrate_reason to migrate_mode.h. This is not strictly
   necessary for this patch, but migrate mode and migrate reason go
   together, so this will slightly clarify things.
