quota: check block number when reading the block in quota file

The block number in the quota tree on disk should be smaller than the
v2_disk_dqinfo.dqi_blocks. If the quota file was corrupted, we may be
allocating an 'allocated' block and that would lead to a loop in a tree,
which will probably trigger oops later. This patch adds a check for the
block number in the quota tree to prevent such potential issue.
