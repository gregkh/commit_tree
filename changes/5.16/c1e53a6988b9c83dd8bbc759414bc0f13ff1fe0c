io_uring: optimise io_free_batch_list()

Delay reading the next node in io_free_batch_list(), allows the compiler
to load the value a bit later improving register spilling in some cases.
With gcc 11.1 it helped to move @task_refs variable from the stack to a
register and optimises out a couple of per request instructions.
