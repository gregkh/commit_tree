scsi: sd: add concurrent positioning ranges support

Add the sd_read_cpr() function to the sd scsi disk driver to discover
if a device has multiple concurrent positioning ranges (i.e. multiple
actuators on an HDD). The existence of VPD page B9h indicates if a
device has multiple concurrent positioning ranges. The page content
describes each range supported by the device.

sd_read_cpr() is called from sd_revalidate_disk() and uses the block
layer functions disk_alloc_independent_access_ranges() and
disk_set_independent_access_ranges() to represent the set of actuators
of the device as independent access ranges.

The format of the Concurrent Positioning Ranges VPD page B9h is defined
in section 6.6.6 of SBC-5.
