ASoC: wcd9335: Use correct version to initialize Class H

The versioning scheme was changed in an earlier patch, which caused the version
being used to initialize WCD9335 to be interpreted as if it was WCD937X, which
changed code paths causing broken headphones output. Pass WCD9335 instead of
WCD9335_VERSION_2_0 to wcd_clsh_ctrl_alloc to fix it.
