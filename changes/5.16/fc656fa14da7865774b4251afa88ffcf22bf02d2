thermal/drivers/netlink: Add the temperature when crossing a trip point

The slope of the temperature increase or decrease can be high and when
the temperature crosses the trip point, there could be a significant
difference between the trip temperature and the measured temperatures.

That forces the userspace to read the temperature back right after
receiving a trip violation notification.

In order to be efficient, give the temperature which resulted in the
trip violation.
