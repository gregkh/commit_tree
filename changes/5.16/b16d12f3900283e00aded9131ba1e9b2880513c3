selftests/bpf: Use cpu_number only on arches that have it

cpu_number exists only on Intel and aarch64, so skip the test involing
it on other arches. An alternative would be to replace it with an
exported non-ifdefed primitive-typed percpu variable from the common
code, but there appears to be none.
