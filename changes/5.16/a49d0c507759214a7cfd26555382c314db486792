mm/writeback: Add folio_wait_stable()

Move wait_for_stable_page() into the folio compatibility file.
folio_wait_stable() avoids a call to compound_head() and is 14 bytes
smaller than wait_for_stable_page() was.  The net text size grows by 16
bytes as a result of this patch.  We can also remove thp_head() as this
was the last user.
