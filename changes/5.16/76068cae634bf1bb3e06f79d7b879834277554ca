btrfs: defrag: replace hard coded PAGE_SIZE with sectorsize

When testing subpage defrag support, I always find some strange inode
nbytes error, after a lot of debugging, it turns out that
defrag_lookup_extent() is using PAGE_SIZE as size for
lookup_extent_mapping().

Since lookup_extent_mapping() is calling __lookup_extent_mapping() with
@strict == 1, this means any extent map smaller than one page will be
ignored, prevent subpage defrag to grab a correct extent map.

There are quite some PAGE_SIZE usage in ioctl.c, but most of them are
correct usages, and can be one of the following cases:

- ioctl structure size check
  We want ioctl structure to be contained inside one page.

- real page operations

The remaining cases in defrag_lookup_extent() and
check_defrag_in_cache() will be addressed in this patch.
