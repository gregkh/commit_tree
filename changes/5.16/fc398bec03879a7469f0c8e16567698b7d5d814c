net: dpaa2: add adaptive interrupt coalescing

Add support for adaptive interrupt coalescing to the dpaa2-eth driver.
First of all, ETHTOOL_COALESCE_USE_ADAPTIVE_RX is defined as a supported
coalesce parameter and the requested state is configured through the
dpio APIs added in the previous patch.

Besides the ethtool API interaction, we keep track of how many bytes and
frames are dequeued per CDAN (Channel Data Availability Notification)
and update the Net DIM instance through the dpaa2_io_update_net_dim()
API.
