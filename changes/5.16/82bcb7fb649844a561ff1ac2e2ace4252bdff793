iio: st_sensors: remove st_sensors_deallocate_trigger() function

This change converts the st_sensors_allocate_trigger() to use
device-managed functions.

The parent device of the IIO device object is used. This is based on the
assumption that all other devm_ calls in the ST sensors use this reference.

That makes the st_sensors_deallocate_trigger() function un-needed, so it
can be removed.
