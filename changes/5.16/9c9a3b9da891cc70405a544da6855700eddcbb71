ALSA: usb-audio: Rename early_playback_start flag with lowlatency_playback

This is a preparation patch for the upcoming low-latency improvement
changes.

Rename early_playback_start flag with lowlatency_playback as it's more
intuitive.  The new flag is basically a reverse meaning.

Along with the rename, factor out the code to set the flag to a
function.  This makes the complex condition checks simpler.

Also, the same flag is introduced to snd_usb_endpoint, too, that is
carried from the snd_usb_substream flag.  Currently the endpoint flag
isn't still referred, but will be used in later patches.
