mm/swapfile: fix an integer overflow in swap_show()

This one is just a minor nuisance for people going through /proc/swaps
if any of their swapareas is bigger than, or equal to 1073741824 pages
(4TB).

seq_printf() format string casts as uint the conversion from pages to
KB, and that will overflow in the aforementioned case.

Albeit being almost unthinkable that someone would actually set up such
big of a single swaparea, there is a ticket recently filed against RHEL:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008812

Given that all other codesites that use format strings for the same swap
pages-to-KB conversion do cast it as ulong, this patch just follows
suit.
