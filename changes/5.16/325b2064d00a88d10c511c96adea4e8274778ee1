ice: Implement support for SMA and U.FL on E810-T

Expose SMA and U.FL connectors as ptp_pins on E810-T based adapters and
allow controlling them.

E810-T adapters are equipped with:
- 2 external bidirectional SMA connectors
- 1 internal TX U.FL
- 1 internal RX U.FL

U.FL connectors share signal lines with the SMA connectors. The TX U.FL1
share the line with the SMA1 and the RX U.FL2 share line with the SMA2.
This dependence is controlled by the ice_verify_pin_e810t.

Additionally add support for the E810-T-based  devices which don't use the
SMA/U.FL controller. If the IO expander is not detected don't expose pins
and use 2 predefined 1PPS input and output pins.
