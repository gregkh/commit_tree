net: dsa: avoid refcount warnings when ->port_{fdb,mdb}_del returns error

At present, when either of ds->ops->port_fdb_del() or ds->ops->port_mdb_del()
return a non-zero error code, we attempt to save the day and keep the
data structure associated with that switchdev object, as the deletion
procedure did not complete.

However, the way in which we do this is suspicious to the checker in
lib/refcount.c, who thinks it is buggy to increment a refcount that
became zero, and that this is indicative of a use-after-free.
