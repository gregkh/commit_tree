block: cache request queue in bdev

There are tons of places where we need to get a request_queue only
having bdev, which turns into bdev->bd_disk->queue. There are probably a
hundred of such places considering inline helpers, and enough of them
are in hot paths.

Cache queue pointer in struct block_device and make use of it in
bdev_get_queue().
