drivers/cdrom: improved ioctl for media change detection

The current implementation of the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl relies on
global state, meaning that only one process can detect a disc change
while the ioctl call will return 0 for other calling processes afterwards
(see bug 213267).

This introduces a new cdrom ioctl, CDROM_TIMED_MEDIA_CHANGE, that
works by maintaining a timestamp of the last detected disc change instead
of a boolean flag: Processes calling this ioctl command can provide
a timestamp of the last disc change known to them and receive
an indication whether the disc was changed since then and the updated
timestamp.

I considered fixing the buggy behavior in the original
CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl but that would require maintaining state
for each calling process in the kernel, which seems like a worse
solution than introducing this new ioctl.
