arm64: dts: qcom: ipq6018: Remove unused 'iface_clk' property from dma-controller node

'iface_clk' clock is not used by the
qcom, bam_dma driver, so remove the same from 'ipq6018' dts.

This is a preparatory patch for subsequent patch in
this series which converts the qcom_bam_dma device-tree
binding into YAML format.

Without this change, 'make dtbs_check' leads to the following
error:
 $ arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/ipq6018-cp01-c1.dt.yaml:
     dma-controller@7984000: clock-names: ['iface_clk', 'bam_clk']
     is too long

Fix the same.
