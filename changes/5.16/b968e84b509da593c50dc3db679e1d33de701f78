x86/iopl: Fake iopl(3) CLI/STI usage

Since commit c8137ace5638 ("x86/iopl: Restrict iopl() permission
scope") it's possible to emulate iopl(3) using ioperm(), except for
the CLI/STI usage.

Userspace CLI/STI usage is very dubious (read broken), since any
exception taken during that window can lead to rescheduling anyway (or
worse). The IOPL(2) manpage even states that usage of CLI/STI is highly
discouraged and might even crash the system.

Of course, that won't stop people and HP has the dubious honour of
being the first vendor to be found using this in their hp-health
package.

In order to enable this 'software' to still 'work', have the #GP treat
the CLI/STI instructions as NOPs when iopl(3). Warn the user that
their program is doing dubious things.
