libbpf: Deprecate multi-instance bpf_program APIs

Schedule deprecation of a set of APIs that are related to multi-instance
bpf_programs:
  - bpf_program__set_prep() ([0]);
  - bpf_program__{set,unset}_instance() ([1]);
  - bpf_program__nth_fd().

These APIs are obscure, very niche, and don't seem to be used much in
practice. bpf_program__set_prep() is pretty useless for anything but the
simplest BPF programs, as it doesn't allow to adjust BPF program load
attributes, among other things. In short, it already bitrotted and will
bitrot some more if not removed.

With bpf_program__insns() API, which gives access to post-processed BPF
program instructions of any given entry-point BPF program, it's now
possible to do whatever necessary adjustments were possible with
set_prep() API before, but also more. Given any such use case is
automatically an advanced use case, requiring users to stick to
low-level bpf_prog_load() APIs and managing their own prog FDs is
reasonable.
