phy: cadence-torrent: Model reference clock driver as a clock to enable derived refclk

When reference clock driver is enabled, either derived or received refclk
is output on cmn_refclk_p/m. Update the reference clock driver
implementation by modelling reference clock driver as a "clock" with
derived reference clock set as its default parent. The support for
received reference clock will be added in a separate patch.
