net: dsa: tag_8021q: make dsa_8021q_{rx,tx}_vid take dp as argument

Pass a single argument to dsa_8021q_rx_vid and dsa_8021q_tx_vid that
contains the necessary information from the two arguments that are
currently provided: the switch and the port number.

Also rename those functions so that they have a dsa_port_* prefix, since
they operate on a struct dsa_port *.
