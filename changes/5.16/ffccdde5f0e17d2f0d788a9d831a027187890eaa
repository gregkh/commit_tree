media: uvcvideo: Return -EIO for control errors

The device is doing something unexpected with the control. Either because
the protocol is not properly implemented or there has been a HW error.

Fixes v4l2-compliance:

Control ioctls (Input 0):
                fail: v4l2-test-controls.cpp(448): s_ctrl returned an error (22)
        test VIDIOC_G/S_CTRL: FAIL
                fail: v4l2-test-controls.cpp(698): s_ext_ctrls returned an error (22)
        test VIDIOC_G/S/TRY_EXT_CTRLS: FAIL
