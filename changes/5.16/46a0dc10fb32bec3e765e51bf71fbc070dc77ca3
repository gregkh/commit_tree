mtd: rawnand: intel: Fix potential buffer overflow in probe

ebu_nand_probe() read the value of u32 variable "cs" from the device
firmware description and used it as the index for array ebu_host->cs
that can contain MAX_CS (2) elements at most. That could result in
a buffer overflow and various bad consequences later.

Fix the potential buffer overflow by restricting values of "cs" with
MAX_CS in probe.
