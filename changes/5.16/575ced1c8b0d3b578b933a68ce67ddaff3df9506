mm/swap: Add folio_rotate_reclaimable()

Convert rotate_reclaimable_page() to folio_rotate_reclaimable().  This
eliminates all five of the calls to compound_head() in this function,
saving 75 bytes at the cost of adding 15 bytes to its one caller,
end_page_writeback().  We also save 36 bytes from pagevec_move_tail_fn()
due to using folios there.  Net 96 bytes savings.

Also move its declaration to mm/internal.h as it's only used by filemap.c.
