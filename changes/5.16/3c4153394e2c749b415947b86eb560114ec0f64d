bnxt_en: implement firmware live patching

Live patches are activated by using the 'limit no_reset' option when
performing a devlink dev reload fw_activate operation. These packages
must first be installed on the device in the usual way. For example,
via devlink dev flash or ethtool -f.

The devlink device info has also been enhanced to render stored and
running live patch versions.
