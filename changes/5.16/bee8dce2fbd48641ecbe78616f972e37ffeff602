ARM: imx_v6_v7_defconfig: enable bpf syscall and cgroup bpf

Enable CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL and CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF to allow for systemd
interoperability. This avoids the following failure on boot:

[   10.615914] systemd[1]: system-getty.slice: unit configures an IP
 firewall, but the local system does not support BPF/cgroup firewalling.
