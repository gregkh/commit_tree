fq_codel: generalise ce_threshold marking for subset of traffic

Commit e72aeb9ee0e3 ("fq_codel: implement L4S style ce_threshold_ect1
marking") expanded the ce_threshold feature of FQ-CoDel so it can
be applied to a subset of the traffic, using the ECT(1) bit of the ECN
field as the classifier. However, hard-coding ECT(1) as the only
classifier for this feature seems limiting, so let's expand it to be more
general.

To this end, change the parameter from a ce_threshold_ect1 boolean, to a
one-byte selector/mask pair (ce_threshold_{selector,mask}) which is applied
to the whole diffserv/ECN field in the IP header. This makes it possible to
classify packets by any value in either the ECN field or the diffserv
field. In particular, setting a selector of INET_ECN_ECT_1 and a mask of
INET_ECN_MASK corresponds to the functionality before this patch, and a
mask of ~INET_ECN_MASK allows using the selector as a straight-forward
match against a diffserv code point:

 # apply ce_threshold to ECT(1) traffic
 tc qdisc replace dev eth0 root fq_codel ce_threshold 1ms ce_threshold_selector 0x1/0x3

 # apply ce_threshold to ECN-capable traffic marked as diffserv AF22
 tc qdisc replace dev eth0 root fq_codel ce_threshold 1ms ce_threshold_selector 0x50/0xfc

Regardless of the selector chosen, the normal rules for ECN-marking of
packets still apply, i.e., the flow must still declare itself ECN-capable
by setting one of the bits in the ECN field to get marked at all.
