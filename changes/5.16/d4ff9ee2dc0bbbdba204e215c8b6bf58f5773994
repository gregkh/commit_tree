bpf/tests: Add JMP tests with small offsets

This patch adds a set of tests for JMP to verify that the JITed jump
offset is calculated correctly. We pretend that the verifier has inserted
any zero extensions to make the jump-over operations JIT to one
instruction each, in order to control the exact JITed jump offset.
