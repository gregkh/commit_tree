iwlwifi: add vendor specific capabilities for some RFs

On some RFs we want to advertise vendor specific capabilities to
indicate support for improved beamforming rates and/or on 160 MHz,
some APs where Intel has collaborated with the vendor will use it
to improve behaviour. Add these elements where relevant, i.e. for
HR and GF RFs.
