soc: samsung: exynos-chipid: do not enforce built-in

After converting the Exynos ChipID and ASV driver to a module, allow to
actually choose it to be a module, while being a default built-in.  The
side effect is that driver could be now entirely disabled even for
kernel with ARCH_EXYNOS, but this is not a critical issue because driver
is not necessary for the proper platform boot.
