net: dsa: lantiq_gswip: serialize access to the PCE table

Looking at the code, the GSWIP switch appears to hold bridging service
structures (VLANs, FDBs, forwarding rules) in PCE table entries.
Hardware access to the PCE table is non-atomic, and is comprised of
several register reads and writes.

These accesses are currently serialized by the rtnl_lock, but DSA is
changing its driver API and that lock will no longer be held when
calling ->port_fdb_add() and ->port_fdb_del().

So this driver needs to serialize the access to the PCE table using its
own locking scheme. This patch adds that.
