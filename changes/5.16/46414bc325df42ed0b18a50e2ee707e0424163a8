ASoC: intel: sof_rt5682: support jsl_rt5682s_rt1015p board

This patch adds driver data for two ALC1015Q-VB speaker amplifiers on
SSP1 and one ALC5682I-VS headphone codec on SSP0 for JSL platform.

Topology is leveraged from jsl_rt5682_rt1015p since the capability of
two ALC5682 variants is the same.
