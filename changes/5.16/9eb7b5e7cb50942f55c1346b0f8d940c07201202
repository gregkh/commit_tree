net: dpaa2-mac: add support for more ethtool 10G link modes

Phylink documentation says:
  Note that the PHY may be able to transform from one connection
  technology to another, so, eg, don't clear 1000BaseX just
  because the MAC is unable to BaseX mode. This is more about
  clearing unsupported speeds and duplex settings. The port modes
  should not be cleared; phylink_set_port_modes() will help with this.

So add the missing 10G modes.
