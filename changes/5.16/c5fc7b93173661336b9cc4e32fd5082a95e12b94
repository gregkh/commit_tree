block: have plug stored requests hold references to the queue

Requests that were stored in the cache deliberately didn't hold an enter
reference to the queue, instead we grabbed one every time we pulled a
request out of there. That made for awkward logic on freeing the remainder
of the cached list, if needed, where we had to artificially raise the
queue usage count before each free.

Grab references up front for cached plug requests. That's safer, and also
more efficient.
