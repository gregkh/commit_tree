net/mlx5: E-Switch, Use indirect table only if all destinations support it

When adding rule with multiple destinations, indirect table is used for all of
the destinations if at least one of the destinations support it, this can cause
creation of invalid indirect tables for the destinations that doesn't support it.

Fixed it by using indirect table only if all destinations support it.
