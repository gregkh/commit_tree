clk: at91: pmc: execute suspend/resume only for backup mode

Before going to backup mode architecture specific PM code sets the first
word in securam (file arch/arm/mach-at91/pm.c, function at91_pm_begin()).
Thus take this into account when suspending/resuming clocks. This will
avoid executing unnecessary instructions when suspending to non backup
modes.
