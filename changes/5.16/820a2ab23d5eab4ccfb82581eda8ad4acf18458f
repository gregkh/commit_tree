drm: panel-orientation-quirks: Update the Lenovo Ideapad D330 quirk (v2)

2 improvements to the Lenovo Ideapad D330 panel-orientation quirks:

1. Some versions of the Lenovo Ideapad D330 have a DMI_PRODUCT_NAME of
"81H3" and others have "81MD". Testing has shown that the "81MD" also has
a 90 degree mounted panel. Drop the DMI_PRODUCT_NAME from the existing
quirk so that the existing quirk matches both variants.

2. Some of the Lenovo Ideapad D330 models have a HD (800x1280) screen
instead of a FHD (1200x1920) screen (both are mounted right-side-up) add
a second Lenovo Ideapad D330 quirk for the HD version.

Changes in v2:
- Add a new quirk for Lenovo Ideapad D330 models with a HD screen instead
  of a FHD screen
