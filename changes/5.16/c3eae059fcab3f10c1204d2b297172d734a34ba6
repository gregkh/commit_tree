iwlwifi: mvm: improve log when processing CSA

Sometimes driver fails to detect misbehaving AP since we may
miss a few beacons (AP is declared misbehaving only after the second
time CSA counter has a wrong jump).
Move the print to the start of the function to avoid doubts when
analysing this kind of issues.
