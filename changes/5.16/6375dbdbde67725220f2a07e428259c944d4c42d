ASoC: SOF: Intel: bdw: Set the mailbox offset directly in bdw_probe

To align with other platforms, set only the sdev->dsp_box.offset in
bdw_probe().
The mailbox offset must be set in order to be able to receive the firmware
ready message.

The offsets and sizes will be re-configured after the FW ready message
based on the window information.
