mlxsw: spectrum_router: Propagate extack further

The next patch will set the MAC profile of a router interface (RIF) as
part of its configure() callback. The operation can fail in case the
maximum number of profiles was exceeded.

Add extack to mlxsw_sp_rif_ops::configure() in order to communicate such
failures to user space.

In addition, the MAC profile of a RIF can change following a
'NETDEV_CHANGEADDR' notification. Propagate extack to
mlxsw_sp_router_port_change_event() so that failures could be
communicated in this path as well.

No functional changes intended.
