bpftool: Provide a helper method for accessing skeleton's embedded ELF data

This adds a skeleton method X__elf_bytes() which returns the binary data of
the compiled and embedded BPF object file. It additionally sets the size of
the return data to the provided size_t pointer argument.

The assignment to s->data is cast to void * to ensure no warning is issued if
compiled with a previous version of libbpf where the bpf_object_skeleton field
is void * instead of const void *
