mm/writeback: Add folio_cancel_dirty()

Turn __cancel_dirty_page() into __folio_cancel_dirty() and add wrappers.
Move the prototypes into pagemap.h since this is page cache functionality.
Saves 44 bytes of kernel text in total; 33 bytes from __folio_cancel_dirty
and 11 from two callers of cancel_dirty_page().
