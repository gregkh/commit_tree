btrfs: defrag: also check PagePrivate for subpage cases in cluster_pages_for_defrag()

In function cluster_pages_for_defrag() we have a window where we unlock
page, either start the ordered range or read the content from disk.

When we re-lock the page, we need to make sure it still has the correct
page->private for subpage.

Thus add the extra PagePrivate check here to handle subpage cases
properly.
