x86/irq: Ensure PI wakeup handler is unregistered before module unload

Add a synchronize_rcu() after clearing the posted interrupt wakeup handler
to ensure all readers, i.e. in-flight IRQ handlers, see the new handler
before returning to the caller.  If the caller is an exiting module and
is unregistering its handler, failure to wait could result in the IRQ
handler jumping into an unloaded module.

The registration path doesn't require synchronization, as it's the
caller's responsibility to not generate interrupts it cares about until
after its handler is registered.
