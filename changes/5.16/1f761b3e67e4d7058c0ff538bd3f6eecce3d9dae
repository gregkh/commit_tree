MIPS: Allow modules to set board_be_handler

After making the brcmstb_gisb driver modular with 707a4cdf86e5 ("bus:
brcmstb_gisb: Allow building as module") Guenter reported that mips
allmodconfig failed to link because board_be_handler was referenced.

Thomas indicated that if we were to continue making the brcmstb_gisb
driver modular for MIPS we would need to introduce a function that
allows setting the board_be_handler and export that function towards
modules.

This is what is being done here: board_be_handler is made static and is
now settable with a mips_set_be_handler() function which is exported.
