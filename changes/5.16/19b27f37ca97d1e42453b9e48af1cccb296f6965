MAINTAINERS: Update powerpc KVM entry

Paul is no longer handling patches for kvmppc.

Instead we'll treat them as regular powerpc patches, taking them via the
powerpc tree, using the topic/ppc-kvm branch when necessary.

Also drop the web reference, it doesn't have any information
specifically relevant to powerpc KVM.
