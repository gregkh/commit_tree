KVM: x86: Report host tsc and realtime values in KVM_GET_CLOCK

Handling the migration of TSCs correctly is difficult, in part because
Linux does not provide userspace with the ability to retrieve a (TSC,
realtime) clock pair for a single instant in time. In lieu of a more
convenient facility, KVM can report similar information in the kvm_clock
structure.

Provide userspace with a host TSC & realtime pair iff the realtime clock
is based on the TSC. If userspace provides KVM_SET_CLOCK with a valid
realtime value, advance the KVM clock by the amount of elapsed time. Do
not step the KVM clock backwards, though, as it is a monotonic
oscillator.
