KVM: arm64: selftests: Add arch_timer test

Add a KVM selftest to validate the arch_timer functionality.
Primarily, the test sets up periodic timer interrupts and
validates the basic architectural expectations upon its receipt.

The test provides command-line options to configure the period
of the timer, number of iterations, and number of vCPUs.
