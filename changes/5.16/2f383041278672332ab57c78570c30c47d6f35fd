libbpf: Make libbpf_version.h non-auto-generated

Turn previously auto-generated libbpf_version.h header into a normal
header file. This prevents various tricky Makefile integration issues,
simplifies the overall build process, but also allows to further extend
it with some more versioning-related APIs in the future.

To prevent accidental out-of-sync versions as defined by libbpf.map and
libbpf_version.h, Makefile checks their consistency at build time.

Simultaneously with this change bump libbpf.map to v0.6.

Also undo adding libbpf's output directory into include path for
kernel/bpf/preload, bpftool, and resolve_btfids, which is not necessary
because libbpf_version.h is just a normal header like any other.
