media: venus: fix vpp frequency calculation for decoder

In existing video driver implementation vpp frequency calculation in
calculate_inst_freq() is always zero because the value of vpp_freq_per_mb
is always zero for decoder.

Fixed this by correcting the calculating the vpp frequency calculation for
decoder.
