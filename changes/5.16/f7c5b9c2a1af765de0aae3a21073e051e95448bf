arm64: dts: rockchip: adjust rk3568 pll clocks

The rk3568 gpll should run at 1200mhz and the ppll should run at 200mhz.
These are set incorrectly by the bootloader, so fix them here.

gpll boots at 1188mhz, but to get most accurate dividers for all
gpll_dividers it needs to run at 1200mhz, otherwise everyone downstream
isn't quite right.

ppll feeds the combophys, which has a divide by 2 clock, so 200mhz is
required to reach a 100mhz clock input for them.

The vendor-kernel also makes this fix.
