selftests/bpf: Add trace_vprintk test prog

This commit adds a test prog for vprintk which confirms that:
  * bpf_trace_vprintk is writing to /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
  * __bpf_vprintk macro works as expected
  * >3 args are printed
  * bpf_printk w/ 0 format args compiles
  * bpf_trace_vprintk call w/ a fmt specifier but NULL fmt data fails

Approach and code are borrowed from trace_printk test.
