page_pool: Revert "page_pool: disable dma mapping support..."

This reverts commit d00e60ee54b12de945b8493cf18c1ada9e422514.

As reported by Guillaume in [1]:
Enabling LPAE always enables CONFIG_ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT
in 32-bit systems, which breaks the bootup proceess when a
ethernet driver is using page pool with PP_FLAG_DMA_MAP flag.
As we were hoping we had no active consumers for such system
when we removed the dma mapping support, and LPAE seems like
a common feature for 32 bits system, so revert it.
