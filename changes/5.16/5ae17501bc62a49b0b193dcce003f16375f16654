scsi: core: Avoid leaving shost->last_reset with stale value if EH does not run

The changes to issue the abort from the scmd->abort_work instead of the EH
thread introduced a problem if eh_deadline is used.  If aborting the
command(s) is successful, and there are never any scmds added to the
shost->eh_cmd_q, there is no code path which will reset the ->last_reset
value back to zero.

The effect of this is that after a successful abort with no EH thread
activity, a subsequent timeout, perhaps a long time later, might
immediately be considered past a user-set eh_deadline time, and the host
will be reset with no attempt at recovery.

Fix this by resetting ->last_reset back to zero in scmd_eh_abort_handler()
if it is determined that the EH thread will not run to do this.

Thanks to Gopinath Marappan for investigating this problem.
