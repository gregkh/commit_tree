libbpf: Use static const fmt string in __bpf_printk

The __bpf_printk convenience macro was using a 'char' fmt string holder
as it predates support for globals in libbpf. Move to more efficient
'static const char', but provide a fallback to the old way via
BPF_NO_GLOBAL_DATA so users on old kernels can still use the macro.
