PCI: vmd: Assign a number to each VMD controller

If the system has multiple VMD controllers, the driver does not assign
a number to each controller, so when analyzing the interrupt through
/proc/interrupts, the names of all controllers are the same, which is
not very convenient for problem analysis. Here, try to assign a number
to each VMD controller.
