drm/i915/dp: Add support for out-of-bound hotplug events

On some Cherry Trail devices, DisplayPort over Type-C is supported through
a USB-PD microcontroller (e.g. a fusb302) + a mux to switch the superspeed
datalines between USB-3 and DP (e.g. a pi3usb30532). The kernel in this
case does the PD/alt-mode negotiation itself, rather then everything being
handled in firmware.

So the kernel itself picks an alt-mode, tells the Type-C "dongle" to switch
to DP mode and sets the mux accordingly. In this setup the HPD pin is not
connected, so the i915 driver needs to respond to a software event and scan
the DP port for changes manually.

This commit adds support for this. Together with the recent addition of
DP alt-mode support to the Type-C subsystem this makes DP over Type-C
work on these devices.
