virtio-gpu: fix possible memory allocation failure

When kmem_cache_zalloc in virtio_gpu_get_vbuf fails, it will return
an error code. But none of its callers checks this error code, and
a core dump will take place.

Considering many of its callers can't handle such error, I add
a __GFP_NOFAIL flag when calling kmem_cache_zalloc to make sure
it won't fail, and delete those unused error handlings.
