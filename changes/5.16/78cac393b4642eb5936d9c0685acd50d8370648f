drivers/perf: thunderx2_pmu: Change data in size tx2_uncore_event_update()

A LSL of 32 requires > 32b value to hold the result. However in
tx2_uncore_event_update(), 1UL << 32 currently only works as unsigned
long is 64b on a 64b system.

If we want to compile test for a 32b system, we need unsigned long long,
whose min size is 64b.
