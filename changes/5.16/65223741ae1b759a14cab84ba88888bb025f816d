bpf: Support writable context for bare tracepoint

Commit 9df1c28bb752 ("bpf: add writable context for raw tracepoints")
supports writable context for tracepoint, but it misses the support
for bare tracepoint which has no associated trace event.

Bare tracepoint is defined by DECLARE_TRACE(), so adding a corresponding
DECLARE_TRACE_WRITABLE() macro to generate a definition in __bpf_raw_tp_map
section for bare tracepoint in a similar way to DEFINE_TRACE_WRITABLE().
