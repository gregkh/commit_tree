ASoC: cs35l41: Fix use of an uninitialised variable

The loop checking PDN_DONE doesn't check the return value from
regmap_read, nor does it initialise val. This means if regmap_read fails
val will be checked for the PDN_DONE bit whilst being uninitialised.

Fix this up by switching to regmap_read_poll_timeout which tidies up the
code and avoids the uninitialised variable.
