drm/i915/dsi: fuse dsi_send_pkt_payld() and add_payld_to_queue()

Having two functions for this seems like excess duplication and
parameter juggling. Merge them together.

While at it, drop the extra error message, as wait_for_payload_credits()
already prints an error, and switch from incidental -EPERM (i.e. -1) to
actual error codes.
