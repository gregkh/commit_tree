memory: remove unused CONFIG_MEM_BLOCK_SIZE

Commit 3947be1969a9 ("[PATCH] memory hotplug: sysfs and add/remove
functions") defines CONFIG_MEM_BLOCK_SIZE, but this has never been
utilized anywhere.

It is a good practice to keep the CONFIG_* defines exclusively for the
Kbuild system.  So, drop this unused definition.

This issue was noticed due to running ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py.
