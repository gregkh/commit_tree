fortify: Move remaining fortify helpers into fortify-string.h

When commit a28a6e860c6c ("string.h: move fortified functions definitions
in a dedicated header.") moved the fortify-specific code, some helpers
were left behind. Move the remaining fortify-specific helpers into
fortify-string.h so they're together where they're used. This requires
that any FORTIFY helper function prototypes be conditionally built to
avoid "no prototype" warnings. Additionally removes unused helpers.
