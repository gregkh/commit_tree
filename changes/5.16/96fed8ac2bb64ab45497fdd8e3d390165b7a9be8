kprobes: treewide: Remove trampoline_address from kretprobe_trampoline_handler()

The __kretprobe_trampoline_handler() callback, called from low level
arch kprobes methods, has the 'trampoline_address' parameter, which is
entirely superfluous as it basically just replicates:

  dereference_kernel_function_descriptor(kretprobe_trampoline)

In fact we had bugs in arch code where it wasn't replicated correctly.

So remove this superfluous parameter and use kretprobe_trampoline_addr()
instead.
