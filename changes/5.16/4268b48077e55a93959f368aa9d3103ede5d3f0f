mm/filemap: Add folio_end_writeback()

Add an end_page_writeback() wrapper function for users that are not yet
converted to folios.

folio_end_writeback() is less than half the size of end_page_writeback()
at just 105 bytes compared to 228 bytes, due to removing all the
compound_head() calls.  The 30 byte wrapper function makes this a net
saving of 93 bytes.
