net/smc: keep static copy of system EID

The system EID is retrieved using an registered ISM device each time
when needed. This adds some unnecessary complexity at all places where
the system EID is needed, but no ISM device is at hand.
Simplify the code and save the system EID in a static variable in
smc_ism.c.
