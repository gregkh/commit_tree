wcn36xx: Fix discarded frames due to wrong sequence number

The firmware is offering features such as ARP offload, for which
firmware crafts its own (QoS)packets without waking up the host.
Point is that the sequence numbers generated by the firmware are
not in sync with the host mac80211 layer and can cause packets
such as firmware ARP reponses to be dropped by the AP (too old SN).

To fix this we need to let the firmware manages the sequence
numbers by its own (except for QoS null frames). There is a SN
counter for each QoS queue and one global/baseline counter for
Non-QoS.
