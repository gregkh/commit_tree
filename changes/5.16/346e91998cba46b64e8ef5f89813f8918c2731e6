tools headers UAPI: Sync linux/kvm.h with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  b56639318bb2be66 ("KVM: SEV: Add support for SEV intra host migration")
  e615e355894e6197 ("KVM: x86: On emulation failure, convey the exit reason, etc. to userspace")
  a9d496d8e08ca1eb ("KVM: x86: Clarify the kvm_run.emulation_failure structure layout")
  c68dc1b577eabd56 ("KVM: x86: Report host tsc and realtime values in KVM_GET_CLOCK")
  dea8ee31a0392775 ("RISC-V: KVM: Add SBI v0.1 support")

That just rebuilds perf, as these patches don't add any new KVM ioctl to
be harvested for the the 'perf trace' ioctl syscall argument
beautifiers.

This is also by now used by tools/testing/selftests/kvm/, a simple test
build succeeded.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/linux/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h include/uapi/linux/kvm.h
