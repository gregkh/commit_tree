iio: adis16475: make use of the new unmasked_drdy flag

The library can now handle enabling/disabling IRQs for devices that
cannot unmask the data ready pin. Hence there's no need to provide an
'enable_irq' callback anymore.

The library will also automatically request the IRQ with 'IRQF_NO_AUTOEN'
so that we can also remove that from the driver.
