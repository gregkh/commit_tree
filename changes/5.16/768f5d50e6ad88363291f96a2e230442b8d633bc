rcu: Simplify rcu_report_dead() call to rcu_report_exp_rdp()

Currently, rcu_report_dead() disables preemption across its call to
rcu_report_exp_rdp(), but this is pointless because interrupts are
already disabled by the caller.  In addition, rcu_report_dead() computes
the address of the outgoing CPU's rcu_data structure, which is also
pointless because this address is already present in local variable rdp.
This commit therefore drops the preemption disabling and passes rdp
to rcu_report_exp_rdp().
