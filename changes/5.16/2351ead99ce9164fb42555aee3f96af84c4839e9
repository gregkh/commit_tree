nvmet-tcp: fix use-after-free when a port is removed

When removing a port, all its controllers are being removed, but there
are queues on the port that doesn't belong to any controller (during
connection time). This causes a use-after-free bug for any command
that dereferences req->port (like in nvmet_alloc_ctrl). Those queues
should be destroyed before freeing the port via configfs. Destroy
the remaining queues after the accept_work was cancelled guarantees
that no new queue will be created.
