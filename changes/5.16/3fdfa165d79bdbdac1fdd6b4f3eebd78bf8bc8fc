mxser: restore baud rate if its setting fails

If a user tries to set a too high rate, it fails due to check in
mxser_set_baud(). But the high rate remains set in termios, so the user
might think everything went smooth. Restore the baud rate from the
old_termios if this happens, so that user knows nothing was changed in
fact.

It used to behave the correct way many years ago, but somehow the
restoration vanished with commit 1c45607ad3eb (Char: mxser, remove it)
-- the commit removed mxser's older clone.
