staging: r8188eu: simplify c2h_evt_hdl function

Simplify c2h_evt_hdl function by removing majority of its code. The
function always returned _FAIL anyway, due to the wrapper function it
calls always returning _FAIL, and its one caller doesn't use the return
value, so this function should just have a return type of void.

Leave the call to c2h_evt_read in place, as without it, event handling
semantics of the driver would be changed, despite nothing actually being
done with the event.
