media: cxd2880-spi: Fix a null pointer dereference on error handling path

Currently the null pointer check on dvb_spi->vcc_supply is inverted and
this leads to only null values of the dvb_spi->vcc_supply being passed
to the call of regulator_disable causing null pointer dereferences.
Fix this by only calling regulator_disable if dvb_spi->vcc_supply is
not null.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference after null check")
