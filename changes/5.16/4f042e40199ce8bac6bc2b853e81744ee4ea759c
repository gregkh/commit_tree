platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Add support for Surface Laptop Studio

Add support for the Surface Laptop Studio.

In contrast to previous Surface Laptop models, this one has its HID
devices attached to target ID 1 (instead of 2). It also has a couple
more of them, including a new notifier for when the pen is stashed /
taken out of its place, a "Sys Control" device, and two other
unidentified HID devices with unknown usages.

Battery and performance profile interfaces remain the same.
