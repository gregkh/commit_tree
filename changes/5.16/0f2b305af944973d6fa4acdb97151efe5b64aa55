cifs: connect individual channel servers to primary channel server

Today, we don't have any way to get the smb session for any
of the secondary channels. Introducing a pointer to the primary
server from server struct of any secondary channel. The value will
be NULL for the server of the primary channel. This will enable us
to get the smb session for any channel.

This will be needed for some of the changes that I'm planning
to make soon.
