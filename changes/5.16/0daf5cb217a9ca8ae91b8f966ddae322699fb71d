ftrace/samples: Add missing prototypes direct functions

There's another compilation fail (first here [1]) reported by kernel
test robot for W=1 clang build:

  >> samples/ftrace/ftrace-direct-multi-modify.c:7:6: warning: no previous
  prototype for function 'my_direct_func1' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
     void my_direct_func1(unsigned long ip)

Direct functions in ftrace direct sample modules need to have prototypes
defined. They are already global in order to be visible for the inline
assembly, so there's no problem.

The kernel test robot reported just error for ftrace-direct-multi-modify,
but I got same errors also for the rest of the modules touched by this patch.
