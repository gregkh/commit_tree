dyndbg: make dyndbg a known cli param

Right now dyndbg shows up as an unknown parameter if used on boot:

    Unknown command line parameters: dyndbg=+p

That's because it is unknown, it doesn't sit in the __param
section, so the processing done to warn users supplying an unknown
parameter doesn't think it is legitimate.

Install a dummy handler to register it. dynamic debug needs to search
the whole command line for modules listed that are currently builtin,
so there's no real work to be done in this callback.
