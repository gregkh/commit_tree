seg6: export get_srh() for ICMP handling

An ICMP error message can contain in its message body part of an IPv6
packet which invoked the error. Such a packet might contain a segment
router header. Export get_srh() so the ICMP code can make use of it.

Since his changes the scope of the function from local to global, add
the seg6_ prefix to keep the namespace clean. And move it into seg6.c
so it is always available, not just when IPV6_SEG6_LWTUNNEL is
enabled.
