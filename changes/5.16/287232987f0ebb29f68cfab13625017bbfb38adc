irq: csky: perform irqentry in entry code

In preparation for removing HANDLE_DOMAIN_IRQ_IRQENTRY, have arch/csky
perform all the irqentry accounting in its entry code. As arch/csky uses
GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER, we can use generic_handle_arch_irq() to do
so.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
