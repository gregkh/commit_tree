scsi: core: Use a structure member to track the SCSI command submitter

Conditional statements are faster than indirect calls. Use a structure
member to track the SCSI command submitter such that later patches can call
scsi_done(scmd) instead of scmd->scsi_done(scmd).

The asymmetric behavior that scsi_send_eh_cmnd() sets the submission
context to the SCSI error handler and that it does not restore the
submission context to the SCSI core is retained.
