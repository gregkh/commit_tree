net: bridge: move br_fdb_replay inside br_switchdev.c

br_fdb_replay is only called from switchdev code paths, so it makes
sense to be disabled if switchdev is not enabled in the first place.

As opposed to br_mdb_replay and br_vlan_replay which might be turned off
depending on bridge support for multicast and VLANs, FDB support is
always on. So moving br_mdb_replay and br_vlan_replay inside
br_switchdev.c would mean adding some #ifdef's in br_switchdev.c, so we
keep those where they are.

The reason for the movement is that in future changes there will be some
code reuse between br_switchdev_fdb_notify and br_fdb_replay.
