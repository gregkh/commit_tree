usb: dwc2: drd: fix dwc2_force_mode call in dwc2_ovr_init

Instead of forcing the role to Device, check the dr_mode configuration.
If the core is Host only, force the mode to Host, this to avoid the
dwc2_force_mode warning:
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 21 at drivers/usb/dwc2/core.c:615 dwc2_drd_init+0x104/0x17c

When forcing mode to Host, dwc2_force_mode may sleep the time the host
role is applied. To avoid sleeping while atomic context, move the call
to dwc2_force_mode after spin_unlock_irqrestore. It is safe, as
interrupts are not yet unmasked here.
