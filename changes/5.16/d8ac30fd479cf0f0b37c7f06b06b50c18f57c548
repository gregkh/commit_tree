drm/i915/ttm: Reorganize the ttm move code somewhat

In order to make the code a bit more readable and to facilitate
async memcpy moves, reorganize the move code a little. Determine
at an early stage whether to copy or to clear.

v2:
- Don't set up the memcpy iterators unless we are actually going to memcpy.
