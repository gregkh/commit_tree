riscv: dts: unmatched: Add gpio card detect to mmc-spi-slot

Per HiFive Unmatched schematics, the card detect signal of the
micro SD card is connected to gpio pin #15, which should be
reflected in the DT via the <gpios> property, as described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc-spi-slot.txt.
