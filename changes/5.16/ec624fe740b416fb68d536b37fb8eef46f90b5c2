net/sched: Extend qdisc control block with tc control block

BPF layer extends the qdisc control block via struct bpf_skb_data_end
and because of that there is no more room to add variables to the
qdisc layer control block without going over the skb->cb size.

Extend the qdisc control block with a tc control block,
and move all tc related variables to there as a pre-step for
extending the tc control block with additional members.
