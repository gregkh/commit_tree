iommu/dma: Unexport IOVA cookie management

IOVA cookies are now got and put by core code, so we no longer need to
export these to modular drivers. The export for getting MSI cookies
stays, since VFIO can still be a module, but it was already relying on
someone else putting them, so that aspect is unaffected.
