bpf: Make sure bpf_disable_instrumentation() is safe vs preemption.

The initial implementation of migrate_disable() for mainline was a
wrapper around preempt_disable(). RT kernels substituted this with a
real migrate disable implementation.

Later on mainline gained true migrate disable support, but neither
documentation nor affected code were updated.

Remove stale comments claiming that migrate_disable() is PREEMPT_RT only.

Don't use __this_cpu_inc() in the !PREEMPT_RT path because preemption is
not disabled and the RMW operation can be preempted.
