drm/vgem: use shmem helpers

Aside from deleting lots of code the real motivation here is to switch
the mmap over to VM_PFNMAP, to be more consistent with what real gpu
drivers do. They're all VM_PFNMAP, which means get_user_pages doesn't
work, and even if you try and there's a struct page behind that,
touching it and mucking around with its refcount can upset drivers
real bad.

v2: Review from Thomas:
- sort #include
- drop more dead code that I didn't spot somehow

v3: select DRM_GEM_SHMEM_HELPER to make it build (intel-gfx-ci)

v4: I got tricked by 0cf2ef46c6c0 ("drm/shmem-helper: Use cached
mappings by default"), and we need WC in vgem because vgem doesn't
have explicit begin/end cpu access ioctls.

Also add a comment why exactly vgem has to use wc.

v5: Don't set obj->base.funcs, it will default to drm_gem_shmem_funcs
(Thomas)

v6: vgem also needs an MMU for remapping

v7: I absolutely butchered the rebases over the vgem mmap change and
revert and broke the patch. Actually go back to v6 from before the
vgem mmap changes.
