net, neigh: Reject creating NUD_PERMANENT with NTF_MANAGED entries

The combination of NUD_PERMANENT + NTF_MANAGED is not supported and does
not make sense either given the former indicates a static/fixed neighbor
entry whereas the latter a dynamically resolved one. While it is possible
to transition from one over to the other, we should however reject such
creation attempts.
