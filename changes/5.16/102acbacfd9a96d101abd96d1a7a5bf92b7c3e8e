bpf: Replace callers of BPF_CAST_CALL with proper function typedef

In order to keep ahead of cases in the kernel where Control Flow
Integrity (CFI) may trip over function call casts, enabling
-Wcast-function-type is helpful. To that end, BPF_CAST_CALL causes
various warnings and is one of the last places in the kernel
triggering this warning.

For actual function calls, replace BPF_CAST_CALL() with a typedef, which
captures the same details about the given function pointers.

This change results in no object code difference.
