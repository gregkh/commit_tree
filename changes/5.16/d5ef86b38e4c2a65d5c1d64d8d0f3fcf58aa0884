drm/i915: Add pci ids and uapi for DG1

DG1 has support for local memory, which requires the usage of the
lmem placement extension for creating bo's, and memregion queries
to obtain the size. Because of this, those parts of the uapi are
no longer guarded behind FAKE_LMEM.

According to the pull request referenced below, mesa should be mostly
ready for DG1. VK_EXT_memory_budget is not hooked up yet, but we
should definitely just enable the uapi parts by default.
