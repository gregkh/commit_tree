dt-bindings: gpio: zynqmp: Add binding documentation for modepin

This patch adds DT binding document for zynqmp modepin GPIO controller.
Modepin GPIO controller has four GPIO pins which can be configurable
as input or output.

Modepin driver is a bridge between the peripheral driver and GPIO pins.
It has set and get APIs for accessing GPIO pins, based on the device-tree
entry of reset-gpio property in the peripheral driver, every pin can be
configured as input/output and trigger GPIO pin.
