drm/amd/display: unblock abm when odm is enabled only on configs that support it

[Why]
When ODM is enabled, ABM is blocked on dcn31 but unblocked on dcn30.

Since the dcn31 firmware is now able to handle ABM interop with ODM, it
is no longer necessary to block ABM when ODM is enabled.

Since the dcn30 firmware does not handle ABM interop with ODM, leaving
that combination unblocked can lead to one side of the screen appearing
brighter than the other.

[How]
When ODM is enabled, unblock abm on dcn31 and block it on dcn30
