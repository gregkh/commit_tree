mm/damon/vaddr-test: split a test function having >1024 bytes frame size

On some configuration[1], 'damon_test_split_evenly()' kunit test
function has >1024 bytes frame size, so below build warning is
triggered:

      CC      mm/damon/vaddr.o
    In file included from mm/damon/vaddr.c:672:
    mm/damon/vaddr-test.h: In function 'damon_test_split_evenly':
    mm/damon/vaddr-test.h:309:1: warning: the frame size of 1064 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
      309 | }
          | ^

This commit fixes the warning by separating the common logic in the
function.
