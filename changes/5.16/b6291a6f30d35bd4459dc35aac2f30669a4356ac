libbpf: Minimize explicit iterator of section definition array

Remove almost all the code that explicitly iterated BPF program section
definitions in favor of using find_sec_def(). The only remaining user of
section_defs is libbpf_get_type_names that has to iterate all of them to
construct its result.

Having one internal API entry point for section definitions will
simplify further refactorings around libbpf's program section
definitions parsing.
