devlink: Make devlink_register to be void

devlink_register() can't fail and always returns success, but all drivers
are obligated to check returned status anyway. This adds a lot of boilerplate
code to handle impossible flow.

Make devlink_register() void and simplify the drivers that use that
API call.
