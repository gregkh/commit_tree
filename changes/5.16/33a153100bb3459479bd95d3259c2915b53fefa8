net: ipa: directly disable ipa-setup-ready interrupt

We currently maintain a "disabled" Boolean flag to determine whether
the "ipa-setup-ready" SMP2P IRQ handler does anything.  That flag
must be accessed under protection of a mutex.

Instead, disable the SMP2P interrupt when requested, which prevents
the interrupt handler from ever being called.  More importantly, it
synchronizes a thread disabling the interrupt with the completion of
the interrupt handler in case they run concurrently.

Use the IPA setup_complete flag rather than the disabled flag in the
handler to determine whether to ignore any interrupts arriving after
the first.

Rename the "disabled" flag to be "setup_disabled", to be specific
about its purpose.
