HID: check for valid USB device for many HID drivers

Many HID drivers assume that the HID device assigned to them is a USB
device as that was the only way HID devices used to be able to be
created in Linux.  However, with the additional ways that HID devices
can be created for many different bus types, that is no longer true, so
properly check that we have a USB device associated with the HID device
before allowing a driver that makes this assumption to claim it.
