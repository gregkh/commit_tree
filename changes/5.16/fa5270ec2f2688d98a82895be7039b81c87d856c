dmaengine: at_xdmac: call at_xdmac_axi_config() on resume path

at_xdmac could be used on SoCs which supports backup mode (where most
of the SoC power, including power to DMA controller, is closed at suspend
time). Thus, on resume, the settings which were previously done need to be
restored. Do the same for axi configuration.
