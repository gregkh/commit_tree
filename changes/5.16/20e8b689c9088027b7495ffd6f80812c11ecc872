nvme: Add connect option 'discovery'

Add a connect option 'discovery' to specify that the connection
should be made to a discovery controller, not a normal I/O controller.
With discovery controllers supporting unique subsystem NQNs we
cannot easily distinguish by the subsystem NQN if this should be
a discovery connection, but we need this information to blank out
options not supported by discovery controllers.
