KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: Check redist region is not above the VM IPA size

Verify that the redistributor regions do not extend beyond the
VM-specified IPA range (phys_size). This can happen when using
KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST or KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST_REGIONS
with:

  base + size > phys_size AND base < phys_size

Add the missing check into vgic_v3_alloc_redist_region() which is called
when setting the regions, and into vgic_v3_check_base() which is called
when attempting the first vcpu-run. The vcpu-run check does not apply to
KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST_REGIONS because the regions size is known
before the first vcpu-run. Note that using the REDIST_REGIONS API
results in a different check, which already exists, at first vcpu run:
that the number of redist regions is enough for all vcpus.

Finally, this patch also enables some extra tests in
vgic_v3_alloc_redist_region() by calculating "size" early for the legacy
redist api: like checking that the REDIST region can fit all the already
created vcpus.
