s390/vdso: filter out -mstack-guard and -mstack-size

When CONFIG_VMAP_STACK is disabled, the user can enable CONFIG_STACK_CHECK,
which adds a stack overflow check to each C function in the kernel. This is
also done for functions in the vdso page. These functions are run in user
context and user stack sizes are usually different to what the kernel uses.
This might trigger the stack check although the stack size is valid.
Therefore filter the -mstack-guard and -mstack-size flags when compiling
vdso C files.
