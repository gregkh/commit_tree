platform/x86: Add driver for ACPI WMAA EC-based backlight control

A number of upcoming notebook computer designs drive the internal
display panel's backlight PWM through the Embedded Controller (EC).
This EC-based backlight control can be plumbed through to an ACPI
"WMAA" method interface, which in turn can be wrapped by WMI with
the GUID handle 603E9613-EF25-4338-A3D0-C46177516DB7.

Add a new driver, aliased to the WMAA WMI GUID, to expose a sysfs
backlight class driver to control backlight levels on systems with
EC-driven backlights.
