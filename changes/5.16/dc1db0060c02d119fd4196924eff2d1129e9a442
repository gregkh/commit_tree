vduse: check that offset is within bounds in get_config()

This condition checks "len" but it does not check "offset" and that
could result in an out of bounds read if "offset > dev->config_size".
The problem is that since both variables are unsigned the
"dev->config_size - offset" subtraction would result in a very high
unsigned value.

I think these checks might not be necessary because "len" and "offset"
are supposed to already have been validated using the
vhost_vdpa_config_validate() function.  But I do not know the code
perfectly, and I like to be safe.
