panfrost: Don't cleanup the job if it was successfully queued

The labels are misleading. Even though they are all prefixed with 'fail_'
the success case also takes that path, and we should definitely not
cleanup the job if it's been queued. While at it, let's rename those
labels so we don't do the same mistake again.
