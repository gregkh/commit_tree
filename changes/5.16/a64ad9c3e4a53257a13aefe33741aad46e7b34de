drm/panel-edp: Fix "prepare_to_enable" if panel doesn't handle HPD

While cleaning up the descriptions of the delay for eDP panels I
realized that we'd have a bug if any panels need the
"prepare_to_enable" but HPD handling isn't happening in the panel
driver. Let's put in a stopgap to at least make us not violate
timings. This is not perfectly optimal but trying to do better is
hard. At the moment only 2 panels specify this delay and only 30 ms is
at stake. These panels are also currently hooked up with "hpd-gpios"
so effectively this "fix" is just a theoretical fix and won't actually
do anything for any devices currently supported in mainline.
