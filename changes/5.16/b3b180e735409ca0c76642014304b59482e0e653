dmaengine: remove debugfs #ifdef

The ptdma driver has added debugfs support, but this fails to build
when debugfs is disabled:

drivers/dma/ptdma/ptdma-debugfs.c: In function 'ptdma_debugfs_setup':
drivers/dma/ptdma/ptdma-debugfs.c:93:54: error: 'struct dma_device' has no member named 'dbg_dev_root'
   93 |         debugfs_create_file("info", 0400, pt->dma_dev.dbg_dev_root, pt,
      |                                                      ^

      |                                                    ^

Remove the #ifdef in the header, as this only saves a few bytes,
but would require ugly #ifdefs in each driver using it.
Simplify the other user while we're at it.
