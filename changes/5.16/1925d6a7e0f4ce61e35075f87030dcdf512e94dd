drm/virtio: implement context init: track valid capabilities in a mask

The valid capability IDs are between 1 to 63, and defined in the
virtio gpu spec.  This is used for error checking the subsequent
patches.  We're currently only using 2 capability IDs, so this
should be plenty for the immediate future.
