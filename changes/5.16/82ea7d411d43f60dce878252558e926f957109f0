arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Base dynamic CPU power coefficients in reality

The sc7180's dynamic-power-coefficient violates the device tree bindings.
The bindings (arm/cpus.yaml) say that the units for the
dynamic-power-coefficient are supposed to be "uW/MHz/V^2". The ones for
sc7180 aren't this. Qualcomm arbitrarily picked 100 for the "little" CPUs
and then picked a number for the big CPU based on this.

At the time, there was a giant dicussion about this. Apparently Qualcomm
Engineers were instructed not to share the actual numbers here. As part
of the discussion, I pointed out [1] that these numbers shouldn't really
be secret since once a device is shipping anyone can just run a script
and produce them. This patch is the result of running the script I posted
in that discussion on sc7180-trogdor-coachz, which is currently available
for purchase by consumers.

I ran the script four times, measuring little, big, little, big. I used
the 64-bit version of dhrystone 2.2 in my test. I got these results:

Your dynamic-power-coefficient for cpu 6: 489

As you can see, the calculations aren't perfectly consistent but
roughly you could say about 480 for big and 137 for little.

The ratio between these numbers isn't quite the same as the ratio
between the two numbers that Qualcomm used. Perhaps this is because
Qualcomm measured something slightly different than the 64-bit version
of dhrystone 2.2 or perhaps it's because they fudged these numbers a
bit (and fudged the capacity-dmips-mhz). As per discussion [2], let's
use the numbers I came up with and also un-fudge
capacity-dmips-mhz. While unfudging capacity-dmips-mhz, let's scale it
so that bigs are 1024 which seems to be the common practice.

In general these numbers don't need to be perfectly exact. In fact,
they can't be since the CPU power depends a lot on what's being run on
the CPU and the big/little CPUs are each more or less efficient in
different operations. Historically running the 32-bit vs. 64-bit
versions of dhrystone produced notably different numbers, though I
didn't test this time.

We also need to scale all of the sustainable-power numbers by the same
amount. I scale ones related to the big CPUs by the adjustment I made
to the big dynamic-power-coefficient and the ones related to the
little CPUs by the adjustment I made to the little
dynamic-power-coefficient.
