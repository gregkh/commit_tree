selftests/kselftest/runner/run_one(): allow running non-executable files

When running a test program, 'run_one()' checks if the program has the
execution permission and fails if it doesn't.  However, it's easy to
mistakenly lose the permissions, as some common tools like 'diff' don't
support the permission change well[1].  Compared to that, making mistakes
in the test program's path would only rare, as those are explicitly listed
in 'TEST_PROGS'.  Therefore, it might make more sense to resolve the
situation on our own and run the program.

For this reason, this commit makes the test program runner function still
print the warning message but to try parsing the interpreter of the
program and to explicitly run it with the interpreter, in this case.
