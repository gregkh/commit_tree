fsnotify: Protect fsnotify_handle_inode_event from no-inode events

FAN_FS_ERROR allows events without inodes - i.e. for file system-wide
errors.  Even though fsnotify_handle_inode_event is not currently used
by fanotify, this patch protects other backends from cases where neither
inode or dir are provided.  Also document the constraints of the
interface (inode and dir cannot be both NULL).
