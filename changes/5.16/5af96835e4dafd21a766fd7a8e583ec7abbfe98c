libnvdimm/labels: Introduce CXL labels

Now that all of use sites of label data have been converted to nsl_*
helpers, introduce the CXL label format. The ->cxl flag in
nvdimm_drvdata indicates the label format the device expects. A
follow-on patch allows a bus provider to select the label style.

Note that the EFI definition of the labels represents the Linux "claim
class" with a GUID. The CXL definition of the labels stores the same
identifier in UUID byte order.
