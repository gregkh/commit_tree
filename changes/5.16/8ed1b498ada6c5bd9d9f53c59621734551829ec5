arm64: factor out GPR numbering helpers

In <asm/sysreg.h> we have macros to convert the names of general purpose
registers (GPRs) into integer constants, which we use to manually build
the encoding for `MRS` and `MSR` instructions where we can't rely on the
assembler to do so for us.

In subsequent patches we'll need to map the same GPR names to integer
constants so that we can use this to build metadata for exception
fixups.

So that the we can use the mappings elsewhere, factor out the
definitions into a new <asm/gpr-num.h> header, renaming the definitions
to align with this "GPR num" naming for clarity.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
