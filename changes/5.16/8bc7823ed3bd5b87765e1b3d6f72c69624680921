net: drivers: get ready for const netdev->dev_addr

Commit 406f42fa0d3c ("net-next: When a bond have a massive amount
of VLANs...") introduced a rbtree for faster Ethernet address look
up. To maintain netdev->dev_addr in this tree we need to make all
the writes to it go through appropriate helpers. We will make
netdev->dev_addr a const.

Make sure local references to netdev->dev_addr are constant.
