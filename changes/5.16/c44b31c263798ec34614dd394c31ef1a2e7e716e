SUNRPC: Change return value type of .pc_decode

Returning an undecorated integer is an age-old trope, but it's
not clear (even to previous experts in this code) that the only
valid return values are 1 and 0. These functions do not return
a negative errno, rpc_stat value, or a positive length.

Document there are only two valid return values by having
.pc_decode return only true or false.
