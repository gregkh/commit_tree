drm/i915/dsi: refine send MIPI DCS command sequence

According to chapter "Sending Commands to the Panel" in bspec #29738
and #49188. If driver try to send DCS long pakcet, we have to program
TX payload register at first. And configure TX header HW register later.
DSC long packet would not be sent properly if we don't follow this
sequence.
