btrfs: zoned: load zone capacity information from devices

The ZNS specification introduces the concept of a Zone Capacity.  A zone
capacity is an additional per-zone attribute that indicates the number of
usable logical blocks within each zone, starting from the first logical
block of each zone. It is always smaller or equal to the zone size.

With the SINGLE profile, we can set a block group's "capacity" as the same
as the underlying zone's Zone Capacity. We will limit the allocation not
to exceed in a following commit.
