rtc: ab8500: let the core handle the alarm resolution

Tell the RTC core UIE are not supported because the resolution of the alarm
is a minute.

Note that this is in fact also fixing how the resolution is reported as the
previous test was simply ensuring the alarm was more than a minute in the
future while the register has a minute resolution.
This would be ok if the alarm was a countdown but ab8500_rtc_read_alarm
suggests otherwise and the AB8500 datasheet states that the RTC
documentation is not public.

Finally, the comment is wrong and what makes the UIE emulation work is
uie_unsupported being set.
