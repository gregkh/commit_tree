arm64: kexec: pass kimage as the only argument to relocation function

Currently, kexec relocation function (arm64_relocate_new_kernel) accepts
the following arguments:

head:		start of array that contains relocation information.
entry:		entry point for new kernel or purgatory.
dtb_mem:	first and only argument to entry.

The number of arguments cannot be easily expended, because this
function is also called from HVC_SOFT_RESTART, which preserves only
three arguments. And, also arm64_relocate_new_kernel is written in
assembly but called without stack, thus no place to move extra arguments
to free registers.

Soon, we will need to pass more arguments: once we enable MMU we
will need to pass information about page tables.

Pass kimage to arm64_relocate_new_kernel, and teach it to get the
required fields from kimage.
