ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for ASRock NUC Box 1100

This applies a SND_PCI_QUIRK(...) to the ASRock NUC Box 1100 series. This
fixes the issue of the headphone jack not being detected unless warm
rebooted from a certain other OS.

When booting a certain other OS some coeff settings are changed that enable
the audio jack. These settings are preserved on a warm reboot and can be
easily dumped.

The relevant indexes and values where gathered by naively diff-ing and
reading a working and a non-working coeff dump.
