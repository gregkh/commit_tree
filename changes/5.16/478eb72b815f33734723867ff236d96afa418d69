block: optimise req_bio_endio()

First, get rid of an extra branch and chain error checks. Also reshuffle
it with bio_advance(), so it goes closer to the final check, with that
the compiler loads rq->rq_flags only once, and also doesn't reload
bio->bi_iter.bi_size if bio_advance() didn't actually advanced the iter.
