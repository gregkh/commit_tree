coresight: etm4x: Save restore TRFCR_EL1

When the CPU enters a low power mode, the TRFCR_EL1 contents could be
reset. Thus we need to save/restore the TRFCR_EL1 along with the ETM4x
registers to allow the tracing.

The TRFCR related helpers are in a new header file, as we need to use
them for TRBE in the later patches.
