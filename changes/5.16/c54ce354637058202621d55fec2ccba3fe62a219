clk: composite: Fix 'switching' to same clock

During commit 6594988fd625 ("clk: composite: Use rate_ops.determine_rate
when also a mux is available") setting req->best_parent_hw got lost,
so best_parent_hw stays NULL during switch to the same parent. This
results in the (debug) message:
  clk_calc_new_rates: lcdif_pixel not gated but wants to reparent
and the following rate change is dropped.
