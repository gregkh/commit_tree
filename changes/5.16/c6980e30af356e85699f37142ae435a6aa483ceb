selftests/damon: test DAMON enabling with empty target_ids case

DAMON debugfs didn't check empty targets when starting monitoring, and
the issue is fixed with commit b5ca3e83ddb0 ("mm/damon/dbgfs: add
adaptive_targets list check before enable monitor_on").  To avoid future
regression, this commit adds a test case for that in DAMON selftests.
