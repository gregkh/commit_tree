media: CEC: keep related menu entries together

Keep all of the CEC menu items grouped together.
By grouping all of these menu entries inside a menu/endmenu block,
they are forced to be kept together and they are displayed/presented
in a group for users.

Tested with xconfig, gconfig, menuconfig, and nconfig.
