sched,x86: Fix L2 cache mask

Currently AMD/Hygon do not populate l2c_id, this means that for SMT
enabled systems they report an L2 per thread. This is ofcourse not
true but was harmless so far.

However, since commit: 66558b730f25 ("sched: Add cluster scheduler
level for x86") the scheduler topology setup requires:

  SMT <= L2 <= LLC

Which leads to noisy warnings and possibly weird behaviour on affected
chips.

Therefore change the topology generation such that if l2c_id is not
populated it follows the SMT topology, thereby satisfying the
constraint.
