bpftool: Fix install for libbpf's internal header(s)

We recently updated bpftool's Makefile to make it install the headers
from libbpf, instead of pulling them directly from libbpf's directory.
There is also an additional header, internal to libbpf, that needs be
installed. The way that bpftool's Makefile installs that particular
header is currently correct, but would break if we were to modify
$(LIBBPF_INTERNAL_HDRS) to make it point to more than one header.

Use a static pattern rule instead, so that the Makefile can withstand
the addition of other headers to install.

The objective is simply to make the Makefile more robust. It should
_not_ be read as an invitation to import more internal headers from
libbpf into bpftool.
