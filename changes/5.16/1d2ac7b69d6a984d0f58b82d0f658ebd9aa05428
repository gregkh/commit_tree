scsi: target: tcmu: Allocate zeroed pages for data area

Tcmu populates the data area (used for communication with userspace) with
pages that are allocated by calling alloc_page(GFP_NOIO).  Therefore
previous content of the allocated pages is exposed to user space. Avoid
this by adding __GFP_ZERO flag.

Zeroing the pages does (nearly) not affect tcmu throughput, because
allocated pages are re-used for the data transfers of later SCSI cmds.
