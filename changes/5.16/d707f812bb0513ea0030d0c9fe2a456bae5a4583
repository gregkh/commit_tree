wcn36xx: Channel list update before hardware scan

The channel scan list must be updated before triggering a hardware scan
so that firmware takes into account the regulatory info for each single
channel such as active/passive config, power, DFS, etc... Without this
the firmware uses its own internal default channel configuration, which
is not aligned with mac80211 regulatory rules, and misses several
channels (e.g. 144).
