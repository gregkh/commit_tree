xen/x86: restrict PV Dom0 identity mapping

When moving away RAM pages, there having been a mapping of those is not
a proper indication that instead MMIO should be mapped there. At the
point in time this effectively covers the low megabyte only. Mapping of
that is, however, the job of init_mem_mapping(). Comparing the two one
can also spot that we've been wrongly (or at least inconsistently) using
PAGE_KERNEL_IO here.

Simply zap any such mappings instead.
