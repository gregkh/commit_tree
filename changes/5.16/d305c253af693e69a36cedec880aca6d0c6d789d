scsi: lpfc: Wait for successful restart of SLI3 adapter during host sg_reset

A prior patch introduced HBA_NEEDS_CFG_PORT flag logic, but in
lpfc_sli_brdrestart_s3() code path, right after HBA_NEEDS_CFG_PORT is set,
the phba->hba_flag is cleared in lpfc_sli_brdreset().

Fix by calling lpfc_sli_chipset_init() to wait for successful restart of
the HBA in lpfc_host_reset_handler() after lpfc_sli_brdrestart().

lpfc_sli_chipset_init() sets the HBA_NEEDS_CFG_PORT flag so that the
lpfc_sli_hba_setup() routine from lpfc_online() will execute
lpfc_sli_config_port() initialization step when the brdrestart is
successful.
