HID: nintendo: patch hw version for userspace HID mappings

This patch sets the most significant bit of the hid hw version to allow
userspace to distinguish between this driver's input mappings vs. the
default hid mappings. This prevents breaking userspace applications that
use SDL2 for gamepad input, allowing them to distinguish the mappings
based on the version.
