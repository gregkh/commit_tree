scsi: add a scsi_alloc_request helper

Add a new helper that calls blk_get_request and initializes the
scsi_request to avoid the indirect call through ->.initialize_rq_fn.

Note that this makes the pktcdvd driver depend on the SCSI core, but
given that only SCSI devices support SCSI passthrough requests that
is not a functional change.
