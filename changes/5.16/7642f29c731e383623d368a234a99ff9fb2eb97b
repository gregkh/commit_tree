Input: goodix - push error logging up into i2c_read and i2c_write helpers

Make the goodix_i2c_read() and goodix_i2c_write*() helpers log errors
themselves. This allows removing all the error logging from their callers.

This already results in a nice cleanup with the current code and it also
helps to make the upcoming support for controllers without flash cleaner.
