scripts: get_abi.pl: ensure that "others" regex will be parsed

The way the search algorithm works is that reduces the number of regex
expressions that will be checked for a given file entry at sysfs. It
does that by looking at the devnode name. For instance, when it checks for
this file:

	/sys/bus/pci/drivers/iosf_mbi_pci/bind

The logic will seek only the "What:" expressions that end with "bind".
Currently, there are just a couple of What expressions that matches
it:

	What: /sys/bus/fsl\-mc/drivers/.*/bind
	What: /sys/bus/pci/drivers/.*/bind

It will then run an O(nÂ²) algorithm to seek, which runs quickly
when there are few regexs to seek. There are, however, some What:
expressions that end with a wildcard. Those are harder to process.
Right now, they're all grouped together at the "others" group.

As those don't depend on the basename of the node, add an extra
loop to ensure that those will be processed at the end, if
not done yet.
