wireguard: selftests: actually test for routing loops

We previously removed the restriction on looping to self, and then added
a test to make sure the kernel didn't blow up during a routing loop. The
kernel didn't blow up, thankfully, but on certain architectures where
skb fragmentation is easier, such as ppc64, the skbs weren't actually
being discarded after a few rounds through. But the test wasn't catching
this. So actually test explicitly for massive increases in tx to see if
we have a routing loop. Note that the actual loop problem will need to
be addressed in a different commit.
