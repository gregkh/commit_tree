iio: accel: fxls8962af: add wake on event

This adds ways for the SoC to wake from accelerometer wake events.

In the suspend function we skip disabling the sensor if wakeup-source
and events are activated.

If buffered reads are enabled they will be deactivated before suspend.
As the onboard buffer is only holding up to 32 12-bit X/Y/Z data
triplets.
