ipv6: Continue processing multipath route even if gateway attribute is invalid

ip6_route_multipath_del loop continues processing the multipath
attribute even if delete of a nexthop path fails. For consistency,
do the same if the gateway attribute is invalid.

Fixes: 1ff15a710a86 ("ipv6: Check attribute length for RTA_GATEWAY when deleting multipath route")
