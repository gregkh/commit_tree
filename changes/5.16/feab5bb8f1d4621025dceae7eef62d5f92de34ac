ath11k: Align bss_chan_info structure with firmware

pdev_id in structure 'wmi_pdev_bss_chan_info_event' is wrongly placed
at the beginning. This causes invalid values in survey dump. Hence, align
the structure with the firmware.

Note: The firmware releases follow this order since the feature was
implemented. Also, it is not changing across the branches including
QCA6390.

Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.1.0.1-01228-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
