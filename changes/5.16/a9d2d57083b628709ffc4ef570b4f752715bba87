dt-bindings: bluetooth: realtek: Add missing max-speed

additionalProperties prevent any property not explicitly defined in the
binding to be used. Yet, some serial properties like max-speed are valid
and validated through the serial/serial.yaml binding.

Even though the ideal solution would be to use unevaluatedProperties
instead, it's not pratical due to the way the bus bindings have been
described. Let's add max-speed to remove the warning.
