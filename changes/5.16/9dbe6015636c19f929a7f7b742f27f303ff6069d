libbpf: Support kernel module function calls

This patch adds libbpf support for kernel module function call support.
The fd_array parameter is used during BPF program load to pass module
BTFs referenced by the program. insn->off is set to index into this
array, but starts from 1, because insn->off as 0 is reserved for
btf_vmlinux.

We try to use existing insn->off for a module, since the kernel limits
the maximum distinct module BTFs for kfuncs to 256, and also because
index must never exceed the maximum allowed value that can fit in
insn->off (INT16_MAX). In the future, if kernel interprets signed offset
as unsigned for kfunc calls, this limit can be increased to UINT16_MAX.

Also introduce a btf__find_by_name_kind_own helper to start searching
from module BTF's start id when we know that the BTF ID is not present
in vmlinux BTF (in find_ksym_btf_id).
