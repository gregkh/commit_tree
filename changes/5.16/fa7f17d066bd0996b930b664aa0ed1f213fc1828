bpf/selftests: Add test for writable bare tracepoint

Add a writable bare tracepoint in bpf_testmod module, and
trigger its calling when reading /sys/kernel/bpf_testmod
with a specific buffer length. The reading will return
the value in writable context if the early return flag
is enabled in writable context.
