KVM: x86: Fold fx_init() into kvm_arch_vcpu_create()

Move the few bits of relevant fx_init() code into kvm_arch_vcpu_create(),
dropping the superfluous check on vcpu->arch.guest_fpu that was blindly
and wrongly added by commit ed02b213098a ("KVM: SVM: Guest FPU state
save/restore not needed for SEV-ES guest").

Note, KVM currently allocates and then frees FPU state for SEV-ES guests,
rather than avoid the allocation in the first place.  While that approach
is inarguably inefficient and unnecessary, it's a cleanup for the future.

No functional change intended.
