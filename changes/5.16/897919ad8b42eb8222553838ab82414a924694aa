xen/privcmd: make option visible in Kconfig

This configuration option provides a misc device as an API to userspace.
Make this API usable without having to select the module as a transitive
dependency.

This also fixes an issue where localyesconfig would select
CONFIG_XEN_PRIVCMD=m because it was not visible and defaulted to
building as module.
