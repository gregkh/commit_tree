erofs: get rid of ->lru usage

Currently, ->lru is a way to arrange non-LRU pages and has some
in-kernel users. In order to minimize noticable issues of page
reclaim and cache thrashing under high memory presure, limited
temporary pages were all chained with ->lru and can be reused
during the request. However, it seems that ->lru could be removed
when folio is landing.

Let's use page->private to chain temporary pages for now instead
and transform EROFS formally after the topic of the folio / file
page design is finalized.
