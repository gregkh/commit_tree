xfs: compute the maximum height of the rmap btree when reflink enabled

Instead of assuming that the hardcoded XFS_BTREE_MAXLEVELS value is big
enough to handle the maximally tall rmap btree when all blocks are in
use and maximally shared, let's compute the maximum height assuming the
rmapbt consumes as many blocks as possible.
