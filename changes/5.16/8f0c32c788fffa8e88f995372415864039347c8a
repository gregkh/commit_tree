kbuild: move objtool_args back to scripts/Makefile.build

Commit b1a1a1a09b46 ("kbuild: lto: postpone objtool") moved objtool_args
to Makefile.lib, so the arguments can be used in Makefile.modfinal as
well as Makefile.build.

With commit 850ded46c642 ("kbuild: Fix TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS with
LTO_CLANG"), module LTO linking came back to scripts/Makefile.build
again.

So, there is no more reason to keep objtool_args in a separate file.

Get it back to the original place, close to the objtool command.

Remove the stale comment too.
