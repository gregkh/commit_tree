perf intel-pt: Fix intel_pt_fup_event() assumptions about setting state type

intel_pt_fup_event() assumes it can overwrite the state type if there has
been an FUP event, but this is an unnecessary and unexpected constraint on
callers.

Fix by touching only the state type flags that are affected by an FUP
event.
