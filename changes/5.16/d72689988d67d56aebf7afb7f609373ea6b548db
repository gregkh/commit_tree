clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Drop CNT*_TVAL read accessors

The arch timer driver never reads the various TVAL registers, only
writes to them. It is thus pointless to provide accessors
for them and to implement errata workarounds.

Drop these read-side accessors, and add a couple of BUG() statements
for the time being. These statements will be removed further down
the line.
