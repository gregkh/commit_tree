pinctrl: qcom: fix unmet dependencies on GPIOLIB for GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP

When PINCTRL_QCOM_SPMI_PMIC or PINCTRL_QCOM_SSBI_PMIC
is selected, and GPIOLIB is not selected, Kbuild
gives the following warnings:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
  Depends on [n]: GPIOLIB [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - PINCTRL_QCOM_SPMI_PMIC [=y] && PINCTRL [=y] && (ARCH_QCOM [=n] || COMPILE_TEST [=y]) && OF [=y] && SPMI [=y]

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
  Depends on [n]: GPIOLIB [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - PINCTRL_QCOM_SSBI_PMIC [=y] && PINCTRL [=y] && (ARCH_QCOM [=n] || COMPILE_TEST [=y]) && OF [=y]

This is because these config options enable GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
without selecting or depending on GPIOLIB, despite
GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP depending on GPIOLIB.

These unmet dependency bugs were detected by Kismet,
a static analysis tool for Kconfig. Please advise if this
is not the appropriate solution.
