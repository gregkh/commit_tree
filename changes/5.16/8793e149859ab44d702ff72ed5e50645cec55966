gfs2: set glock object after nq

Before this patch, function gfs2_create_inode called glock_set_object to
set the gl_object for inode and iopen glocks before the glock was locked.
That's wrong because other competing processes like evict may be
blocked waiting for the glock and still have gl_object set before the
actual eviction can take place.

This patch moves the call to glock_set_object until after the glock is
acquire in function gfs2_create_inode, so it waits for possibly
competing evicts to finish their processing first.
