KVM: arm64: selftests: Add guest support to get the vcpuid

At times, such as when in the interrupt handler, the guest wants
to get the vcpuid that it's running on to pull the per-cpu private
data. As a result, introduce guest_get_vcpuid() that returns the
vcpuid of the calling vcpu. The interface is architecture
independent, but defined only for arm64 as of now.
