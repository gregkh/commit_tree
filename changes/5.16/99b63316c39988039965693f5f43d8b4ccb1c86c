thermal: core: Reset previous low and high trip during thermal zone init

During the suspend is in process, thermal_zone_device_update bails out
thermal zone re-evaluation for any sensor trip violation without
setting next valid trip to that sensor. It assumes during resume
it will re-evaluate same thermal zone and update trip. But when it is
in suspend temperature goes down and on resume path while updating
thermal zone if temperature is less than previously violated trip,
thermal zone set trip function evaluates the same previous high and
previous low trip as new high and low trip. Since there is no change
in high/low trip, it bails out from thermal zone set trip API without
setting any trip. It leads to a case where sensor high trip or low
trip is disabled forever even though thermal zone has a valid high
or low trip.

During thermal zone device init, reset thermal zone previous high
and low trip. It resolves above mentioned scenario.
