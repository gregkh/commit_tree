platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Add initial support for Surface Pro 8

Add preliminary support for the Surface Pro 8 to the Surface Aggregator
registry. This includes battery/charger status and platform profile
support.

In contrast to earlier Surface Pro generations, the keyboard cover is
now also connected via the Surface Aggregator Module (whereas it was
previously connected via USB or HID-over-I2C). To properly support the
HID devices of that cover, however, more changes regarding hot-removal
of Surface Aggregator client devices as well as a new device hub driver
are required. We will address those things in a follow-up series, so do
not add any HID device IDs just yet.
