drm/i915/adlp/tc: Fix PHY connected check for Thunderbolt mode

On ADL-P the PHY ready (aka status complete on other platforms) flag is
always set, besides when a DP-alt, legacy sink is connected also when a
TBT sink is connected or nothing is connected. So assume the PHY to be
connected when both the TBT live status and PHY ready flags are set.
