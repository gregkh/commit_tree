libbpf: Deprecate AF_XDP support

Deprecate AF_XDP support in libbpf ([0]). This has been moved to
libxdp as it is a better fit for that library. The AF_XDP support only
uses the public libbpf functions and can therefore just use libbpf as
a library from libxdp. The libxdp APIs are exactly the same so it
should just be linking with libxdp instead of libbpf for the AF_XDP
functionality. If not, please submit a bug report. Linking with both
libraries is supported but make sure you link in the correct order so
that the new functions in libxdp are used instead of the deprecated
ones in libbpf.

Libxdp can be found at https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools.
