ACPI: resources: Add one more Medion model in IRQ override quirk

The Medion s17 series laptops have the same issue on the keyboard
as the s15 series, if skipping to call acpi_get_override_irq(), the
keyboard could work well. So put the DMI info of s17 series in the
IRQ override quirk table as well.
