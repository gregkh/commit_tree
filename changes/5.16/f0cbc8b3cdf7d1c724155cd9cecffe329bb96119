x86/fpu: Do not leak fpstate pointer on fork

If fork fails early then the copied task struct would carry the fpstate
pointer of the parent task.

Not a problem right now, but later when dynamically allocated buffers
are available, keeping the pointer might result in freeing the
parent's buffer. Set it to NULL which prevents that. If fork reaches
clone_thread(), the pointer will be correctly set to the new task
context.
