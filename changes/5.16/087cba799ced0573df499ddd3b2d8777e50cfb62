selftests/bpf: Add weak/typeless ksym test for light skeleton

Also, avoid using CO-RE features, as lskel doesn't support CO-RE, yet.
Include both light and libbpf skeleton in same file to test both of them
together.

In c48e51c8b07a ("bpf: selftests: Add selftests for module kfunc support"),
I added support for generating both lskel and libbpf skel for a BPF
object, however the name parameter for bpftool caused collisions when
included in same file together. This meant that every test needed a
separate file for a libbpf/light skeleton separation instead of
subtests.

Change that by appending a "_lskel" suffix to the name for files using
light skeleton, and convert all existing users.
