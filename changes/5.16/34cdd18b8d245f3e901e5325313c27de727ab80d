tracing: Use linker magic instead of recasting ftrace_ops_list_func()

In an effort to enable -Wcast-function-type in the top-level Makefile to
support Control Flow Integrity builds, all function casts need to be
removed.

This means that ftrace_ops_list_func() can no longer be defined as
ftrace_ops_no_ops(). The reason for ftrace_ops_no_ops() is to use that when
an architecture calls ftrace_ops_list_func() with only two parameters
(called from assembly). And to make sure there's no C side-effects, those
archs call ftrace_ops_no_ops() which only has two parameters, as
ftrace_ops_list_func() has four parameters.

Instead of a typecast, use vmlinux.lds.h to define ftrace_ops_list_func() to
arch_ftrace_ops_list_func() that will define the proper set of parameters.
