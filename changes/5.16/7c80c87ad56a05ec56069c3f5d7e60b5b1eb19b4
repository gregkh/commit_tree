selftests/bpf: Switch sk_lookup selftests to strict SEC("sk_lookup") use

Update "sk_lookup/" definition to be a stand-alone type specifier,
with backwards-compatible prefix match logic in non-libbpf-1.0 mode.

Currently in selftests all the "sk_lookup/<whatever>" uses just use
<whatever> for duplicated unique name encoding, which is redundant as
BPF program's name (C function name) uniquely and descriptively
identifies the intended use for such BPF programs.

With libbpf's SEC_DEF("sk_lookup") definition updated, switch existing
sk_lookup programs to use "unqualified" SEC("sk_lookup") section names,
with no random text after it.
