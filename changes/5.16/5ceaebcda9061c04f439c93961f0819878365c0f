drm/amd/display: Fix for the no Audio bug with Tiled Displays

[WHY]
It seems like after a series of plug/unplugs we end up in a situation
where tiled display doesnt support Audio.

[HOW]
The issue seems to be related to when we check streams changed after an
HPD, we should be checking the audio_struct as well to see if any of its
values changed.
