scsi: ufs: core: Stop clearing UNIT ATTENTIONS

Commit aa53f580e67b ("scsi: ufs: Minor adjustments to error handling")
introduced a ufshcd_clear_ua_wluns() call in
ufshcd_err_handling_unprepare(). As explained in detail by Adrian Hunter,
this can trigger a deadlock. Avoid that deadlock by removing the code that
clears the unit attention. This is safe because the only software that
relies on clearing unit attentions is the Android Trusty software and
because support for handling unit attentions has been added in the Trusty
software.
