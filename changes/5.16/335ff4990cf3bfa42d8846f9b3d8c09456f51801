bpf: Merge printk and seq_printf VARARG max macros

MAX_SNPRINTF_VARARGS and MAX_SEQ_PRINTF_VARARGS are used by bpf helpers
bpf_snprintf and bpf_seq_printf to limit their varargs. Both call into
bpf_bprintf_prepare for print formatting logic and have convenience
macros in libbpf (BPF_SNPRINTF, BPF_SEQ_PRINTF) which use the same
helper macros to convert varargs to a byte array.

Changing shared functionality to support more varargs for either bpf
helper would affect the other as well, so let's combine the _VARARGS
macros to make this more obvious.
