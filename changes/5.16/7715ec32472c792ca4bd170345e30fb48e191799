recipe and get a recipe to profile association is mostly used in update

- ice_aqc_opc_add_recipe (0x0290) - create a recipe with protocol
header information and other details that determine how this recipe
filter works

to a profile
- ice_aqc_opc_get_recipe (0x0292) - get details of an existing recipe
- ice_aqc_opc_get_recipe_to_profile (0x0293) - get a recipe associated
with profile ID

Define ICE_AQC_RES_TYPE_RECIPE resource type to hold a switch
recipe. It is needed when a new switch recipe needs to be created.
