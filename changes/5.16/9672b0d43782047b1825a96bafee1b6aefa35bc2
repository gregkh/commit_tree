sbitmap: add __sbitmap_queue_get_batch()

The block layer tag allocation batching still calls into sbitmap to get
each tag, but we can improve on that. Add __sbitmap_queue_get_batch(),
which returns a mask of tags all at once, along with an offset for
those tags.

An example return would be 0xff, where bits 0..7 are set, with
tag_offset == 128. The valid tags in this case would be 128..135.

A batch is specific to an individual sbitmap_map, hence it cannot be
larger than that. The requested number of tags is automatically reduced
to the max that can be satisfied with a single map.

On failure, 0 is returned. Caller should fall back to single tag
allocation at that point/
