ASoC: qcom: common: Respect status = "disabled" on DAI link nodes

At the moment, the DAI link nodes in the device tree always have to be
specified completely in each device tree. However, the available
interfaces (e.g. Primary/Secondary/Tertiary/Quaternary MI2S) are common
for all devices of a SoC, so the majority of the definitions can be
placed in a common device tree include to reduce boilerplate.

Make it possible to define such stubs in device tree includes by
respecting the "status" property for the DAI link nodes. This is
a trivial change that just requires switching to the _available_
OF functions that check the "status" property additionally.

This allows defining a stub like:

	sound_dai_quaternary: dai-link-quaternary {
		link-name = "Quaternary MI2S";
		status = "disabled"; /* Needs extra codec configuration */
		cpu {
			sound-dai = <&q6afedai QUATERNARY_MI2S_RX>;
		};
		platform {
			sound-dai = <&q6routing>;
		};
	};

where the codec would be filled in by the device-specific device tree.

For existing device trees this change does not make any difference.
A missing "status" property is treated like status = "okay".
