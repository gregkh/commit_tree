drm/i915/xehpsdv: Add compute DSS type

Starting in XeHP, the concept of slice has been removed in favor of
DSS (Dual-Subslice) masks for various workload types. These workloads have
been divided into those enabled for geometry and those enabled for compute.

i915 currently maintains a single set of S/SS/EU masks for the device.
The goal of this patch set is to minimize the amount of impact to prior
generations while still giving the user maximum flexibility.

v2:
 - Generalize a comment about uapi access to geometry/compute masks; the
   proposed uapi has changed since the comment was first written, and
   will show up in a future series once the userspace code is published.
   (Lucas)

v3:
 - Eliminate unnecessary has_compute_dss flag.  (Lucas)
 - Drop unwanted comment change in uapi header.  (Lucas)
