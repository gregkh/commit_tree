ASoC: amd: acp: Wrap AMD Audio ACP components in SND_SOC_AMD_ACP_COMMON

The build only descends into sound/soc/amd/acp/ if
CONFIG_SND_SOC_AMD_ACP_COMMON=y.  Hence all later config symbols should
depend on SND_SOC_AMD_ACP_COMMON, to prevent asking the user about
config symbols for driver code that won't be build anyway.
