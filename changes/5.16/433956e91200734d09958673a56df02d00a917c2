bpf: Fix extable fixup offset.

The prog - start_of_ldx is the offset before the faulting ldx to the location
after it, so this will be used to adjust pt_regs->ip for jumping over it and
continuing, and with old temp it would have been fixed up to the wrong offset,
causing crash.

Fixes: 4c5de127598e ("bpf: Emit explicit NULL pointer checks for PROBE_LDX instructions.")
