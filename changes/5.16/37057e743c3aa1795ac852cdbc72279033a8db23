tools headers UAPI: Sync sound/asound.h with the kernel sources

To pick up the changes in:

  5aec579e08e4f2be ("ALSA: uapi: Fix a C++ style comment in asound.h")

That is just changing a // style comment to /* */.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/sound/asound.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/sound/asound.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/sound/asound.h include/uapi/sound/asound.h
