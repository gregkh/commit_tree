selinux: fix race condition when computing ocontext SIDs

Current code contains a lot of racy patterns when converting an
ocontext's context structure to an SID. This is being done in a "lazy"
fashion, such that the SID is looked up in the SID table only when it's
first needed and then cached in the "sid" field of the ocontext
structure. However, this is done without any locking or memory barriers
and is thus unsafe.

Between commits 24ed7fdae669 ("selinux: use separate table for initial
SID lookup") and 66f8e2f03c02 ("selinux: sidtab reverse lookup hash
table"), this race condition lead to an actual observable bug, because a
pointer to the shared sid field was passed directly to
sidtab_context_to_sid(), which was using this location to also store an
intermediate value, which could have been read by other threads and
interpreted as an SID. In practice this caused e.g. new mounts to get a
wrong (seemingly random) filesystem context, leading to strange denials.
This bug has been spotted in the wild at least twice, see [1] and [2].

Fix the race condition by making all the racy functions use a common
helper that ensures the ocontext::sid accesses are made safely using the
appropriate SMP constructs.

Note that security_netif_sid() was populating the sid field of both
contexts stored in the ocontext, but only the first one was actually
used. The SELinux wiki's documentation on the "netifcon" policy
statement [3] suggests that using only the first context is intentional.
I kept only the handling of the first context here, as there is really
no point in doing the SID lookup for the unused one.

I wasn't able to reproduce the bug mentioned above on any kernel that
includes commit 66f8e2f03c02, even though it has been reported that the
issue occurs with that commit, too, just less frequently. Thus, I wasn't
able to verify that this patch fixes the issue, but it makes sense to
avoid the race condition regardless.
