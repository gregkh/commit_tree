pwm: Make it explicit that pwm_apply_state() might sleep

At least some implementations sleep. So mark pwm_apply_state() with a
might_sleep() to make callers aware. In the worst case this uncovers a
valid atomic user, then we revert this patch and at least gained some more
knowledge and then can work on a concept similar to
gpio_get_value/gpio_get_value_cansleep.
