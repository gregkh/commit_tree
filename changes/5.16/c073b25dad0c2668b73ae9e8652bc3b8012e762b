i2c: i801: Stop using pm_runtime_set_autosuspend_delay(-1)

The original change works as intended, but Andy pointed in [0] that now
userspace could re-enable RPM via sysfs, even though we explicitly want
to disable it. So effectively revert the original patch, just with small
improvements:
- Calls to pm_runtime_allow()/pm_runtime_forbid() don't have to be
  balanced, so we can remove the call to pm_runtime_forbid() in
  i801_remove().
- priv->acpi_reserved is accessed after i801_acpi_remove(), and according
  to Robert [1] the custom handler can't run any longer. Therefore we
  don't have to take priv->acpi_lock.
