mm/damon/schemes: implement statistics feature

To tune the DAMON-based operation schemes, knowing how many and how
large regions are affected by each of the schemes will be helful.  Those
stats could be used for not only the tuning, but also monitoring of the
working set size and the number of regions, if the scheme does not
change the program behavior too much.

For the reason, this implements the statistics for the schemes.  The
total number and size of the regions that each scheme is applied are
exported to users via '->stat_count' and '->stat_sz' of 'struct damos'.
Admins can also check the number by reading 'schemes' debugfs file.  The
last two integers now represents the stats.  To allow collecting the
stats without changing the program behavior, this also adds new scheme
action, 'DAMOS_STAT'.  Note that 'DAMOS_STAT' is not only making no
memory operation actions, but also does not reset the age of regions.
