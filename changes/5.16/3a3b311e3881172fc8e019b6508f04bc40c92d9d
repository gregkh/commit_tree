i40e: Fix warning message and call stack during rmmod i40e driver

Restore part of reset functionality used when reset is called
from the VF to reset itself. Without this fix warning message
is displayed when VF is being removed via sysfs.

Fix the crash of the VF during reset by ensuring
that the PF receives the reset message successfully.
Refactor code to use one function instead of two.
