samples/bpf: Fix incorrect use of strlen in xdp_redirect_cpu

Commit b599015f044d ("samples/bpf: Fix application of sizeof to pointer")
tried to fix a bug where sizeof was incorrectly applied to a pointer instead
of the array string was being copied to, to find the destination buffer size,
but ended up using strlen, which is still incorrect. However, on closer look
ifname_buf has no other use, hence directly use optarg.

Fixes: e531a220cc59 ("samples: bpf: Convert xdp_redirect_cpu to XDP samples helper")
