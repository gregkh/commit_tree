xfs: compute maximum AG btree height for critical reservation calculation

Compute the actual maximum AG btree height for deciding if a per-AG
block reservation is critically low.  This only affects the sanity check
condition, since we /generally/ will trigger on the 10% threshold.  This
is a long-winded way of saying that we're removing one more usage of
XFS_BTREE_MAXLEVELS.
