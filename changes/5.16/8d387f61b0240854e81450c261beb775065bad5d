usb: dwc2: drd: fix dwc2_drd_role_sw_set when clock could be disabled

In case of USB_DR_MODE_PERIPHERAL, the OTG clock is disabled at the end of
the probe (it is not the case if USB_DR_MODE_HOST or USB_DR_MODE_OTG).
The clock is then enabled on udc_start.
If dwc2_drd_role_sw_set is called before udc_start (it is the case if the
usb cable is plugged at boot), GOTGCTL and GUSBCFG registers cannot be
read/written, so session cannot be overridden.
To avoid this case, check the ll_hw_enabled value and enable the clock if
it is available, and disable it after the override.
