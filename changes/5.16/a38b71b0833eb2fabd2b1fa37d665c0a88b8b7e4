clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Move system register timer programming over to CVAL

In order to cope better with high frequency counters, move the
programming of the timers from the countdown timer (TVAL) over
to the comparator (CVAL).

The programming model is slightly different, as we now need to
read the current counter value to have an absolute deadline
instead of a relative one.

There is a small overhead to this change, which we will address
in the following patches.
