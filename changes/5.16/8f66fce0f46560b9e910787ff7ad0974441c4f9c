parisc: Correct completer in lws start

The completer in the "or,ev %r1,%r30,%r30" instruction is reversed, so we are
not clipping the LWS number when we are called from a 32-bit process (W=0).
We need to nulify the following depdi instruction when the least-significant
bit of %r30 is 1.

If the %r20 register is not clipped, a user process could perform a LWS call
that would branch to an undefined location in the kernel and potentially crash
the machine.
