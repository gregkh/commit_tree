signal/vm86_32: Replace open coded BUG_ON with an actual BUG_ON

The function save_v86_state is only called when userspace was
operating in vm86 mode before entering the kernel.  Not having vm86
state in the task_struct should never happen.  So transform the hand
rolled BUG_ON into an actual BUG_ON to make it clear what is
happening.
