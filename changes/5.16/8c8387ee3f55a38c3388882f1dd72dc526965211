mm: stop filemap_read() from grabbing a superfluous page

Under some circumstances, filemap_read() will allocate sufficient pages
to read to the end of the file, call readahead/readpages on them and
copy the data over - and then it will allocate another page at the EOF
and call readpage on that and then ignore it.  This is unnecessary and a
waste of time and resources.

filemap_read() *does* check for this, but only after it has already done
the allocation and I/O.  Fix this by checking before calling
filemap_get_pages() also.
