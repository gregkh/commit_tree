remoteproc: qcom: pas: Use the same init resources for MSM8996 and MSM8998

The resources for MSM8996 are missing power domains, and adding them
makes the resources identical to the MSM8998 ones.
Rename msm8998_adsp_resource to msm8996_adsp_resource then use it
for both chips. Also add power domains to slpi_resource_init and use
it for both chips.
