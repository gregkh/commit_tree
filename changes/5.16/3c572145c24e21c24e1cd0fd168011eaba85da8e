net/smc: add generic netlink support for system EID

With SMC-Dv2 users can configure if the static system EID should be used
during CLC handshake, or if only user EIDs are allowed.
Add generic netlink support to enable and disable the system EID, and
to retrieve the system EID and its current enabled state.
