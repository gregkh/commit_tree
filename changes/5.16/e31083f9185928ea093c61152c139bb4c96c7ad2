arm64: dts: rockchip: Enable SFC for Odroid Go Advance

This enables the Rockchip Serial Flash Controller for the Odroid Go
Advance. Note that while the attached SPI NOR flash and the controller
both support quad read mode, only 2 of the required 4 pins are present.
The rx bus width is set to 2 for this reason, and tx bus width is set
to 1 for compatibility reasons.
