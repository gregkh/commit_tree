drm/i915/dg2: Add DG2-specific shadow register table

We thought the DG2 table of shadowed registers would be the same as the
gen12/xehp table, but it turns out that there are a few minor
differences that require us to define a new DG2-specific table:
 * One register is removed (0xC4D4)
 * One register is added (0xC4E0)
