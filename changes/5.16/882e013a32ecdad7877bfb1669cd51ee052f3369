ALSA: usb-audio: fix comment reference in __uac_clock_find_source

snd_usb_find_clock_source and snd_usb_find_clock_selector are helper
macros that look at an entity id and validate that this entity id is
in fact a clock source or a clock selector. The present comments
inside __uac_clock_find_source give the reader the impression we're
looking for an entity id.

We're looking for an entity id indeed, the clock source, but since
__uac_clock_find_source is recursive, we're also looking *at* the
entity ids, in the search for the one clock source.

Fix the comment so we don't give readers a wrong idea.
