net: add and use skb_unclone_keeptruesize() helper

While commit 097b9146c0e2 ("net: fix up truesize of cloned
skb in skb_prepare_for_shift()") fixed immediate issues found
when KFENCE was enabled/tested, there are still similar issues,
when tcp_trim_head() hits KFENCE while the master skb
is cloned.

This happens under heavy networking TX workloads,
when the TX completion might be delayed after incoming ACK.

This patch fixes the WARNING in sk_stream_kill_queues
when sk->sk_mem_queued/sk->sk_forward_alloc are not zero.

Fixes: d3fb45f370d9 ("mm, kfence: insert KFENCE hooks for SLAB")
