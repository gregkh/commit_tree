ALSA: firewire-motu: add message parser for meter information in command DSP model

Some of MOTU models allows software to configure their DSP parameters by
command included in asynchronous transaction. The models multiplex messages
for hardware meters into isochronous packet as well as PCM frames. For
convenience, I call them as 'command DSP' model.

This patch adds message parser for them to gather hardware meter
information.
