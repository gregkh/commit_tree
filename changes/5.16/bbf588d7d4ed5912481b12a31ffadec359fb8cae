drm/virtio: implement context init: stop using drv->context when creating fence

The plumbing is all here to do this.  Since we always use the
default fence context when allocating a fence, this makes no
functional difference.

We can't process just the largest fence id anymore, since it's
it's associated with different timelines.  It's fine for fence_id
260 to signal before 259.  As such, process each fence_id
individually.
