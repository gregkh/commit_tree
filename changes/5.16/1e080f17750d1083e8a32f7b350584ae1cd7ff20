net: sched: update default qdisc visibility after Tx queue cnt changes

mq / mqprio make the default child qdiscs visible. They only do
so for the qdiscs which are within real_num_tx_queues when the
device is registered. Depending on order of calls in the driver,
or if user space changes config via ethtool -L the number of
qdiscs visible under tc qdisc show will differ from the number
of queues. This is confusing to users and potentially to system
configuration scripts which try to make sure qdiscs have the
right parameters.

Add a new Qdisc_ops callback and make relevant qdiscs TTRT.

Note that this uncovers the "shortcut" created by
commit 1f27cde313d7 ("net: sched: use pfifo_fast for non real queues")
The default child qdiscs beyond initial real_num_tx are always
pfifo_fast, no matter what the sysfs setting is. Fixing this
gets a little tricky because we'd need to keep a reference
on whatever the default qdisc was at the time of creation.
In practice this is likely an non-issue the qdiscs likely have
to be configured to non-default settings, so whatever user space
is doing such configuration can replace the pfifos... now that
it will see them.
