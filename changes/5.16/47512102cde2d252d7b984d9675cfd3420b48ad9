libbpf: Add "map_extra" as a per-map-type extra flag

This patch adds the libbpf infrastructure for supporting a
per-map-type "map_extra" field, whose definition will be
idiosyncratic depending on map type.

For example, for the bloom filter map, the lower 4 bits of
map_extra is used to denote the number of hash functions.

Please note that until libbpf 1.0 is here, the
"bpf_create_map_params" struct is used as a temporary
means for propagating the map_extra field to the kernel.
