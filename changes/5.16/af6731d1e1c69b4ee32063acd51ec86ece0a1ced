selftests: xsk: Make xdp_flags and bind_flags local

Make xdp_flags and bind_flags local instead of global by moving them
into the interface object. These flags decide if the socket should be
created in SKB mode or in DRV mode and therefore they are sticky and
will survive a test_spec_reset. Since every test is first run in SKB
mode then in DRV mode, this change only happens once. With this
change, the configured_mode global variable can also be
erradicated. The first test_spec_init() also becomes superfluous and
can be eliminated.
