powerpc/booke64: Add LRAT error exception handler

LRAT (Logical to Real Address Translation) present in MMU v2 provides hardware
translation from a logical page number (LPN) to a real page number (RPN) when
tlbwe is executed by a guest or when a page table translation occurs from a
guest virtual address.

Add LRAT error exception handler to Booke3E 64-bit kernel and the basic KVM
handler to avoid build breakage. This is a prerequisite for KVM LRAT support
that will follow.
