crypto: mxs - Remove the old DCP driver

Remove the old DCP driver as it had multiple severe issues. The driver
will be replaced by a more robust implementation. Here is a short list
of problems with this driver:

1) It only supports AES_CBC
2) The driver was apparently never ran behind anyone working with MXS. ie.:
   -> Restarting the DCP block is not done via mxs_reset_block()
   -> The DT name is not "fsl,dcp" or "fsl,mxs-dcp" as other MXS drivers
3) Introduces new ad-hoc IOCTLs
4) The IRQ handler can't use usual completion() in the driver because that'd
   trigger "scheduling while atomic" oops, yes?
