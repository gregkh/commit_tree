drivers: gpu: Mark functions as static in vmwgfx_kms.c

Mark functions as static because they are not used outside the file
drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_kms.c.

This eliminates the following warnings in drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_kms.c:
drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_kms.c:43:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘vmw_clip_cliprects’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_kms.c:426:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘vmw_framebuffer_surface_destroy’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
