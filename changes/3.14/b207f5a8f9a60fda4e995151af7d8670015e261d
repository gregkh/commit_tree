s390/cio: Relax subchannel scan loop

The CIO layer scans for newly available I/O devices by performing a scan
of available subchannels using the Store Subchannel (STSCH) instruction.
This processing can take a significant amount of time during which no
other task can run on the same CPU (unless CONFIG_PREEMPT has been
enabled). As a result, scheduling latencies for other tasks are
increased noticeably, especially on a single-CPU system.

Fix this problem by explicitly allowing other tasks to be scheduled
each time a subchannel has been processed.
