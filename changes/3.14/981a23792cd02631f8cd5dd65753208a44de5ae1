perf probe: Do not add offset twice to uprobe address

Fix perf-probe not to add offset value twice to uprobe probe address
when post processing.

The tevs[i].point.address struct member is the address of symbol+offset,
but current perf-probe adjusts the point.address by adding the offset.

As a result, the probe address becomes symbol+offset+offset. This may
cause unexpected code corruption. Urgent fix is needed.

Without this fix:
  ---
  # ./perf probe -x ./perf dso__load_vmlinux+4
  # ./perf probe -l
    probe_perf:dso__load_vmlinux (on 0x000000000006d2b8)
  # nm ./perf.orig | grep dso__load_vmlinux\$
  000000000046d0a0 T dso__load_vmlinux
  ---

You can see the given offset is 3 but the actual probed address is
dso__load_vmlinux+8.

With this fix:
  ---
  # ./perf probe -x ./perf dso__load_vmlinux+4
  # ./perf probe -l
    probe_perf:dso__load_vmlinux (on 0x000000000006d2b4)
  ---

Now the problem is fixed.
