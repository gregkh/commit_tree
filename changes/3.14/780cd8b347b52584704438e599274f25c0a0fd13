cgroup: make for_each_subsys() useable under cgroup_root_mutex

We want to use for_each_subsys() in cgroupfs_root handling where only
cgroup_root_mutex is held.  The only way cgroup_subsys[] can change is
through module load/unload, make cgroup_[un]load_subsys() grab
cgroup_root_mutex too and update the lockdep annotation in
for_each_subsys() to allow either cgroup_mutex or cgroup_root_mutex.

* Lockdep annotation is moved from inner 'if' condition to outer 'for'
  init caluse.  There's no reason to execute the assertion every loop.

* Loop index @i is renamed to @ssid.  Indices iterating through subsys
  will be [re]named to @ssid gradually.

v2: cgroup_assert_mutex_or_root_locked() caused build failure if
    !CONFIG_LOCKEDP.  Conditionalize its definition.  The build failure
    was reported by kbuild test bot.
