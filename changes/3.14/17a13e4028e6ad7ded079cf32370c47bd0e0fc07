libceph: follow {read,write}_tier fields on osd request submission

Overwrite ceph_osd_request::r_oloc.pool with read_tier for read ops and
write_tier for write and read+write ops (aka basic tiering support).
{read,write}_tier are part of pg_pool_t since v9.  This commit bumps
our pg_pool_t decode compat version from v7 to v9, all new fields
except for {read,write}_tier are ignored.
