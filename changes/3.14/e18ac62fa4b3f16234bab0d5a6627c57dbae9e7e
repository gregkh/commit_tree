ACPI / video: Add HP EliteBook Revolve 810 to the blacklist

On HP EliteBook Revolve 810 the ACPI backlight device doesn't work as
expected. For example when resuming from system sleep, it seems to lose
backlight settings.

Forcing Intel driver fixes the problem so add this machine the ACPI
video detect blacklist.
