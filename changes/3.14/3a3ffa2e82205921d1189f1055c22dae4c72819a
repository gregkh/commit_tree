tools lib traceevent: Report better error message on bad function args

When Jiri Olsa was writing a function callback for
scsi_trace_parse_cdb(), he thought that the traceevent library had a
bug in it because he was getting this error:

  Error: expected ')' but read ','
  Error: expected ')' but read ','
  Error: expected ')' but read ','
  Error: expected ')' but read ','

But in truth, he didn't have the write number of arguments for the
function callback, and the error was the library detecting the
discrepancy. A better error message would have prevented the confusion:

  Error: function 'scsi_trace_parse_cdb()' only expects 2 arguments but event scsi_dispatch_cmd_timeout has more
  Error: function 'scsi_trace_parse_cdb()' only expects 2 arguments but event scsi_dispatch_cmd_start has more
  Error: function 'scsi_trace_parse_cdb()' only expects 2 arguments but event scsi_dispatch_cmd_error has more
  Error: function 'scsi_trace_parse_cdb()' only expects 2 arguments but event scsi_dispatch_cmd_done has more

Or

  Error: function 'scsi_trace_parse_cdb()' expects 4 arguments but event scsi_dispatch_cmd_timeout only uses 3
  Error: function 'scsi_trace_parse_cdb()' expects 4 arguments but event scsi_dispatch_cmd_start only uses 3
  Error: function 'scsi_trace_parse_cdb()' expects 4 arguments but event scsi_dispatch_cmd_error only uses 3
  Error: function 'scsi_trace_parse_cdb()' expects 4 arguments but event scsi_dispatch_cmd_done only uses 3
