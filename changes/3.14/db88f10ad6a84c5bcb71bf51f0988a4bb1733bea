net: stmmac: restore pinstate in pm resume.

This patch adds code to restore default pinstate of the pins when it
comes back from low power state. Without this patch the state of the
pins would be unknown and the driver would not work.

This patch also adds code to put the pins in to sleep state when the
driver enters low power state.
