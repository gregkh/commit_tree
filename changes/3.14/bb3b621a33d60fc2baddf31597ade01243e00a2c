[SCSI] Set the minimum valid value of 'eh_deadline' as 0

The former minimum valid value of 'eh_deadline' is 1s, which means
the earliest occasion to shorten EH is 1 second later since a
command is failed or timed out. But if we want to skip EH steps
ASAP, we have to wait until the first EH step is finished. If the
duration of the first EH step is long, this waiting time is
excruciating. So, it is necessary to accept 0 as the minimum valid
value for 'eh_deadline'.

According to my test, with Hannes' patchset 'New EH command timeout
handler' as well, the minimum IO time is improved from 73s
(eh_deadline = 1) to 43s(eh_deadline = 0) when commands are timed
out by disabling RSCN and target port.
