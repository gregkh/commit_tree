workqueue: add args to workqueue lockdep name

Tommi noticed a 'funny' lock class name: "%s#5" from a lock acquired in
process_one_work().

Maybe #fmt plus #args could be used as the lock_name to give some more
information for some fmt string like the above.

__builtin_constant_p() check is removed (as there seems no good way to
check all the variables in args list). However, by removing the check,
it only adds two additional "s for those constants.

Some lockdep name examples printed out after the change:

lockdep name                    wq->name

"events_long"                   events_long
"%s"("khelper")                 khelper
"xfs-data/%s"mp->m_fsname       xfs-data/dm-3
