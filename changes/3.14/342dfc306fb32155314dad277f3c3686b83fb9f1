net: add build-time checks for msg->msg_name size

This is a follow-up patch to f3d3342602f8bc ("net: rework recvmsg
handler msg_name and msg_namelen logic").

DECLARE_SOCKADDR validates that the structure we use for writing the
name information to is not larger than the buffer which is reserved
for msg->msg_name (which is 128 bytes). Also use DECLARE_SOCKADDR
consistently in sendmsg code paths.
