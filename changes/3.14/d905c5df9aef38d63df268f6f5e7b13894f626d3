PPC: POWERNV: move iommu_add_device earlier

The current implementation of IOMMU on sPAPR does not use iommu_ops
and therefore does not call IOMMU API's bus_set_iommu() which
1) sets iommu_ops for a bus
2) registers a bus notifier
Instead, PCI devices are added to IOMMU groups from
subsys_initcall_sync(tce_iommu_init) which does basically the same
thing without using iommu_ops callbacks.

However Freescale PAMU driver (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/1/158)
implements iommu_ops and when tce_iommu_init is called, every PCI device
is already added to some group so there is a conflict.

This patch does 2 things:
1. removes the loop in which PCI devices were added to groups and
adds explicit iommu_add_device() calls to add devices as soon as they get
the iommu_table pointer assigned to them.
2. moves a bus notifier to powernv code in order to avoid conflict with
the notifier from Freescale driver.

iommu_add_device() and iommu_del_device() are public now.
