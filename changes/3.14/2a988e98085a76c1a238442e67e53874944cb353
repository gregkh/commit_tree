iwlwifi: trans: prevent reprobe on repeated FW errors before restart

In case a sync command timeouts or Tx is stuck while a FW error
interrupt arrives, we might call iwl_op_mode_nic_error twice before
a restart has been initiated. This will cause a reprobe. Unify calls
to this function at the transport level and only call it on the first
FW error in a given by checking the transport FW error flag.

While at it, remove the privately defined iwl_nic_error from PCIE code
and use the common callback instead.
