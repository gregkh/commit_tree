Btrfs: fix max_inline mount option

Currently, the only mount option for max_inline that has any effect is
max_inline=0.  Any other value that is supplied to max_inline will be
adjusted to a minimum of 4k.  Since max_inline has an effective maximum
of ~3900 bytes due to page size limitations, the current behaviour
only has meaning for max_inline=0.

This patch will allow the the max_inline mount option to accept non-zero
values as indicated in the documentation.
