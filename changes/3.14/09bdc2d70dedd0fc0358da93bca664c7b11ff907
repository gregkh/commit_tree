nfsd4: fix acl buffer overrun

4ac7249ea5a0ceef9f8269f63f33cc873c3fac61 "nfsd: use get_acl and
->set_acl" forgets to set the size in the case get_acl() succeeds, so
_posix_to_nfsv4_one() can then write past the end of its allocation.
Symptoms were slab corruption warnings.

Also, some minor cleanup while we're here.  (Among other things, note
that the first few lines guarantee that pacl is non-NULL.)
