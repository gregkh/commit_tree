nfs: fix size updates for aio writes

nfs_file_direct_write only updates the inode size if it succeeded and
returned the number of bytes written.  But in the AIO case nfs_direct_wait
turns the return value into -EIOCBQUEUED and we skip the size update.

Instead the aio completion path should updated it, which this patch
does.  The implementation is a little hacky because there is no obvious
way to find out we are called for a write in nfs_direct_complete.
