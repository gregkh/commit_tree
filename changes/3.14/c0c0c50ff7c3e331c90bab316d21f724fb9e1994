net: gre: use icmp_hdr() to get inner ip header

When dealing with icmp messages, the skb->data points the
ip header that triggered the sending of the icmp message.

In gre_cisco_err(), the parse_gre_header() is called, and the
iptunnel_pull_header() is called to pull the skb at the end of
the parse_gre_header(), so the skb->data doesn't point the
inner ip header.

Unfortunately, the ipgre_err still needs those ip addresses in
inner ip header to look up tunnel by ip_tunnel_lookup().

So just use icmp_hdr() to get inner ip header instead of skb->data.
