KVM: remove useless write to vcpu->hv_clock.tsc_timestamp

After the previous patch from Marcelo, the comment before this write
became obsolete.  In fact, the write is unnecessary.  The calls to
kvm_write_tsc ultimately result in a master clock update as soon as
all TSCs agree and the master clock is re-enabled.  This master
clock update will rewrite tsc_timestamp.

So, together with the comment, delete the dead write too.
