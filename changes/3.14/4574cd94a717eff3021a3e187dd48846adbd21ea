ASoC: ak4642: Convert to direct regmap API usage

This moves us towards being able to remove the ASoC level I/O code which
duplicates regmap functionality. Currently the only difference between
the supported devices in the driver is the regmap so we can replace the
CODEC driver selections with regmap selection instead.
