perf kvm: Make perf kvm diff support --guestmount.

In manpage of perf-kvm, --guestmount is supported by diff command, but
it does not work well.

This patch change the extend the checking in buildid-diff from
guestkallsyms or guestmodules to perf_guest. Then this checking can
cover the all cases perf kvm is used for.
