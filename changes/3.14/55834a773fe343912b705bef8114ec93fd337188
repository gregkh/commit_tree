arm64: defconfig: Expand default enabled features

FPGA implementations of the Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 are now available
in the form of the SMM-A57 and SMM-A53 Soft Macrocell Models (SMMs) for
Versatile Express. As these attach to a Motherboard Express V2M-P1 it
would be useful to have support for some V2M-P1 peripherals enabled by
default.

Additionally a couple of of features have been introduced since the last
defconfig update (CMA, jump labels) that would be good to have enabled
by default to ensure they are build and boot tested.

This patch updates the arm64 defconfig to enable support for these
devices and features. The arm64 Kconfig is modified to select
HAVE_PATA_PLATFORM, which is required to enable support for the
CompactFlash controller on the V2M-P1.

A few options which don't need to appear in defconfig are trimmed:

* BLK_DEV - selected by default
* EXPERIMENTAL - otherwise gone from the kernel
* MII - selected by drivers which require it
* USB_SUPPORT - selected by default
