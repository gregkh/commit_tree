i40e: fix error handling when alloc of vsi array fails

Swap a couple lines around in the error handling if the kzalloc() for
the pf->vsi array fails.  This was causing a kernel BUG because the
call to i40e_clear_interrupt_scheme() was assuming the pf->vsi[] array
existed.  In this fix it is possible that i40e_reset_interrupt_capability()
will get called twice, but this is a safe action.
