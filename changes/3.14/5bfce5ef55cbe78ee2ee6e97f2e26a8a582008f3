x86, kaslr: Provide randomness functions

Adds potential sources of randomness: RDRAND, RDTSC, or the i8254.

This moves the pre-alternatives inline rdrand function into the header so
both pieces of code can use it. Availability of RDRAND is then controlled
by CONFIG_ARCH_RANDOM, if someone wants to disable it even for kASLR.
