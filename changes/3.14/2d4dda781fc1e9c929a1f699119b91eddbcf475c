net: tulip: delete useless tests on netdev_priv

Netdev_priv performs an addition, not a pointer dereference, so it seems
quite unlikely that its result would ever be NULL.

A semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
statement S;
@@

- if (!netdev_priv(...)) S
// </smpl>
