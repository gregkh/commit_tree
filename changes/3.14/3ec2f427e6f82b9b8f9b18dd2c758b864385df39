drm/i915: Fix refcount leak and possible NULL pointerdereference.

Since get_pid_task() grabs a reference on the task_struct, we have to drop the
refcount after reading that task's comm name. Use pid_task() with RCU instead.

Also, avoid directly reading like pid_task()->comm because
pid_task() will return NULL if the task have already exit()ed.

This patch fixes both problems.
