powerpc/book3s: Split the common exception prolog logic into two section.

This patch splits the common exception prolog logic into three parts to
facilitate reuse of existing code in the next patch. This patch also
re-arranges few instructions in such a way that the second part now deals
with saving register values from paca save area to stack frame, and
the third part deals with saving current register values to stack frame.

The second and third part will be reused in the machine check exception
routine in the subsequent patch.

Please note that this patch does not introduce or change existing code
logic. Instead it is just a code movement and instruction re-ordering.

Patch Acked-by Paul. But made some minor modification (explained above) to
address Paul's comment in the later patch(3).
