new sparse warnings:

  >> kernel/sched/cpudeadline.c:38:6: sparse: symbol 'cpudl_exchange' was not declared. Should it be static?
  >> kernel/sched/cpudeadline.c:46:6: sparse: symbol 'cpudl_heapify' was not declared. Should it be static?
  >> kernel/sched/cpudeadline.c:71:6: sparse: symbol 'cpudl_change_key' was not declared. Should it be static?
