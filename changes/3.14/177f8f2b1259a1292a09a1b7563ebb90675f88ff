Bluetooth: Add LE L2CAP segmentation support for outgoing data

This patch adds segmentation support for outgoing data packets. Packets
are segmented based on the MTU and MPS values. The l2cap_chan struct
already contains many helpful variables from BR/EDR Enhanced L2CAP which
can be used for this.
