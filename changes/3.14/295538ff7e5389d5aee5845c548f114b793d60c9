usb: gadget: s3c-hsotg: fix maxpacket size in s3c_hsotg_irq_enumdone

This patch set maximum possible maxpacket value for each speed. Previous
values didn't allow to use maxpacket sizes greater than 64 in full speed
and 512 in high speed, although hardware is able to handle up to 1023 in fs
and 1024 in hs.
