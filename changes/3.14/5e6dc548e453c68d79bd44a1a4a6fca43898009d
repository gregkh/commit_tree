drivers: staging: speakup: serialio: only use platform specific SERIAL_PORT_DFNS.

If SERIAL_PORT_DFNS isn't present by platform, it need be defined to
"nothing", like the 8250 serial driver does it.

All related macros also need be removed: IRQF_SHARED is defined in
"linux/interrupt.h", others will be defined when related architecture
has SERIAL_PORT_DFNS.

Or it will cause issue (for arc, with allmodconfig):
