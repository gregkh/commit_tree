serial: pl011: remove redundant early amba_ports declaration

This early amba_ports declaration was introduced by commit c16d51a32 (amba
pl011: workaround for uart registers lockup) for use in the pl011_lockup_wa()
routine. This routine was later removed by commit 4fd0690bb (serial: pl011:
implement workaround for CTS clear event issue).
