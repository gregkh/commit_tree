kernfs: allow negative dentries

kernfs doesn't allow negative dentries - kernfs_iop_lookup() returns
ERR_PTR(-ENOENT) instead of NULL which short-circuits negative dentry
creation and kernfs's d_delete() callback, kernfs_dop_delete(),
returns 1 for all removed nodes.  This in turn allows
kernfs_dop_revalidate() to assume that there's no negative dentry for
kernfs.

This worked fine for sysfs but kernfs is scheduled to grow mkdir(2)
support which depend on negative dentries.  This patch updates so that
kernfs allows negative dentries.  The required changes are almost
trivial - kernfs_iop_lookup() now returns NULL instead of
ERR_PTR(-ENOENT) when the target kernfs_node doesn't exist,
kernfs_dop_delete() is removed and kernfs_dop_revalidate() is updated
to check whether the target dentry is negative and request fresh
lookup if so.
