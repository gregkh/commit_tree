ASoC: mxs: Remove SND_DMAENGINE_PCM_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE flag

Since commit 7b11304 ("dma: mxs-dma: Report correct residue for cyclic DMA")
the mxs dmaengine driver has support for residue reporting. So there is no need
to specify the SND_DMAENGINE_PCM_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE flag anymore. This allows a
finer grained resolution for the PCM pointer as well as avoids the race
condition that can occur with the period counting that is used when the
dmaengine driver does not support residue reporting.
