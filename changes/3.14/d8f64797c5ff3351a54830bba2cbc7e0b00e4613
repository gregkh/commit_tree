ARM: tegra: add missing clock documentation to DT bindings

Many of the Tegra DT binding documents say nothing about the clocks or
clock-names properties, yet those are present and required in DT files.
This patch simply updates the documentation file to match the implicit
definition of the binding, based on real-world DT content.

All Tegra bindings that mention clocks are updated to have consistent
wording and formatting of the clock-related properties.
