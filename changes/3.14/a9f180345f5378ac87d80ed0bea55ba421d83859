compiler/gcc4: Make quirk for asm_volatile_goto() unconditional

I started noticing problems with KVM guest destruction on Linux
3.12+, where guest memory wasn't being cleaned up. I bisected it
down to the commit introducing the new 'asm goto'-based atomics,
and found this quirk was later applied to those.

Unfortunately, even with GCC 4.8.2 (which ostensibly fixed the
known 'asm goto' bug) I am still getting some kind of
miscompilation. If I enable the asm_volatile_goto quirk for my
compiler, KVM guests are destroyed correctly and the memory is
cleaned up.

So make the quirk unconditional for now, until bug is found
and fixed.
