ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Fix MICPGA input configuration

Currently the Negative Terminal Input Routing Configuration is only set
when there is a special routing configuration. If we don't use one of
the inputs IN1 or IN2 as negative terminal input, the PGA and recording
does not work.

This patch adds a route from CM1L/CM1R to the PGA as negative input by
default. With this configuration the PGA can amplify all input signals
and line-in/mic works again.
