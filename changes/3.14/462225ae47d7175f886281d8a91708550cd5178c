rcu: Add an RCU_INITIALIZER for global RCU-protected pointers

There is currently no way to initialize a global RCU-protected pointer
without either putting up with sparse complaints or open-coding an
obscure cast.  This commit therefore creates RCU_INITIALIZER(), which
is intended to be used as follows:

	struct foo __rcu *p = RCU_INITIALIZER(&my_rcu_structure);

This commit also applies RCU_INITIALIZER() to eliminate repeated
open-coded obscure casts in __rcu_assign_pointer(), RCU_INIT_POINTER(),
and RCU_POINTER_INITIALIZER().  This commit also inlines
__rcu_assign_pointer() into its only caller, rcu_assign_pointer().
