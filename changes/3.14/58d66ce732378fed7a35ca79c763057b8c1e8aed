GenWQE: Fix endian issues detected by sparse

Fengguang Wu used CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__ to check the GenWQE driver for
endian issues. Sparse found a couple of those. Most of them were caused
by not correctly handling __be64/32 and __u64/32. Those I was able to
fix with appropriate castings.

One more serious issue was the ATS entry in struct genwqe_ddcb_cmd.
The kernel expected it in big-endian, but the type was defined __u64.
I decided that it is better to keep the interface consistent using
host endian byte-odering instead of having a mixture. With this change
the kernel likes to see host endian byte order for the ATS entry. That
would have been an interface change, if someone would have used the
driver already. Since this is not the case, I hope it is ok to fix it
now.

For the genqwe_readq/writeq/readl/writel functions I enforced the casts.

It still complains, as far as I can see, about some copy_to/from_user()
usages:

I appreciate some help from you to figure out what is causig those, and
making a proposal how to fix them.

I included the missing header file to fix the
implicit-function-declaration warning when using dynamic_hex_dump.
