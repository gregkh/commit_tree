cpufreq: introduce cpufreq_generic_get() routine

CPUFreq drivers that use clock frameworks interface,i.e. clk_get_rate(),
to get CPUs clk rate, have similar sort of code used in most of them.

This patch adds a generic ->get() which will do the same thing for them.
All those drivers are required to now is to set .get to cpufreq_generic_get()
and set their clk pointer in policy->clk during ->init().
