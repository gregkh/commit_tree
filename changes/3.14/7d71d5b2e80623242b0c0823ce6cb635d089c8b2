clk: mpc5xxx: switch to COMMON_CLK, retire PPC_CLOCK

the setup before the change was
- arch/powerpc/Kconfig had the PPC_CLOCK option, off by default
- depending on the PPC_CLOCK option the arch/powerpc/kernel/clock.c file
  was built, which implements the clk.h API but always returns -ENOSYS
  unless a platform registers specific callbacks
- the MPC52xx platform selected PPC_CLOCK but did not register any
  callbacks, thus all clk.h API calls keep resulting in -ENOSYS errors
  (which is OK, all peripheral drivers deal with the situation)
- the MPC512x platform selected PPC_CLOCK and registered specific
  callbacks implemented in arch/powerpc/platforms/512x/clock.c, thus
  provided real support for the clock API
- no other powerpc platform did select PPC_CLOCK

the situation after the change is
- the MPC512x platform implements the COMMON_CLK interface, and thus the
  PPC_CLOCK approach in arch/powerpc/platforms/512x/clock.c has become
  obsolete
- the MPC52xx platform still lacks genuine support for the clk.h API
  while this is not a change against the previous situation (the error
  code returned from COMMON_CLK stubs differs but every call still
  results in an error)
- with all references gone, the arch/powerpc/kernel/clock.c wrapper and
  the PPC_CLOCK option have become obsolete, as did the clk_interface.h
  header file

the switch from PPC_CLOCK to COMMON_CLK is done for all platforms within
the same commit such that multiplatform kernels (the combination of 512x
and 52xx within one executable) keep working
