MIPS: KVM: use common EHINV aware UNIQUE_ENTRYHI

When KVM is enabled and TLB invalidation is supported,
kvm_mips_flush_host_tlb() can cause a machine check exception due to
multiple matching TLB entries. This can occur on shutdown even when KVM
hasn't been actively used.

Commit adb78de9eae8 (MIPS: mm: Move UNIQUE_ENTRYHI macro to a header
file) created a common UNIQUE_ENTRYHI in asm/tlb.h but it didn't update
the copy of UNIQUE_ENTRYHI in kvm_tlb.c to use it.

Commit 36b175451399 (MIPS: tlb: Set the EHINV bit for TLBINVF cores when
invalidating the TLB) later added TLB invalidation (EHINV) support to
the common UNIQUE_ENTRYHI.

Therefore make kvm_tlb.c use the EHINV aware UNIQUE_ENTRYHI
implementation in asm/tlb.h too.
