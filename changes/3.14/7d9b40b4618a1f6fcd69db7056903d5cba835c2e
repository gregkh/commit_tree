ath10k: add debugfs file to control radar events blocking

Sometimes for DFS testing is required to stay on current channel even after
radar detected. This patch allows to enable/disable radar detected event to be
passed to mac80211.

By default radar detected event in not blocked.

To block it:
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phyX/ath10k/dfs_block_radar_events

To unblock again:
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phyX/ath10k/dfs_block_radar_events

Inform about blocking radar detected event even when logs are disabled
for throughput/performance reasons.
