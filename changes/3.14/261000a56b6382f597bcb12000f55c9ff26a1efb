userns:  userns: Remove UIDGID_STRICT_TYPE_CHECKS

Removing UIDGID_STRICT_TYPE_CHECKS simplifies the code and always
generates a compile error if the uids and kuids or gids and kgids are
mixed by accident.  Now that the appropriate conversions have been
placed throughout the kernel there is no longer a need for a mode where
we don't detect them as compile errors.
