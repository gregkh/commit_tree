fsnotify: Do not return merged event from fsnotify_add_notify_event()

The event returned from fsnotify_add_notify_event() cannot ever be used
safely as the event may be freed by the time the function returns (after
dropping notification_mutex). So change the prototype to just return
whether the event was added or merged into some existing event.
