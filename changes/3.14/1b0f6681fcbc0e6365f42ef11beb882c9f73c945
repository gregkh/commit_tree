ARM: 7911/2: Clean up setup printks a bit

Clean up the setup ARM printks a bit. Add printk level to a few
that were missing (CPU: <...> ones, in particular), and switch from
printk(KERN_* ..) to pr_*().

Finally, un-wrap some long lines since it makes it harder to grep the
sources from where an error came from and tweak some cases of indentation.
