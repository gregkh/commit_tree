mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Introduce multiple page I/O support

As preparation work to fully support large pages, this commit adds
the initial infrastructure to support splitted (aka chunked) I/O
operation. This commit adds support for read, and follow-up patches
will add write support.

When a read (aka READ0) command is issued, the driver loops issuing
the same command until all the requested data is transfered, changing
the 'extended' command field as needed.

For instance, if the driver is required to read a 4 KiB page, using a
chunk size of 2 KiB, the transaction is splitted in:
1. Monolithic read, first 2 KiB page chunk is read
2. Last naked read, second and last 2KiB page chunk is read

If ECC is enabled it is calculated on each chunk transfered and added
at a controller-fixed location after the data chunk that must be
spare area.
