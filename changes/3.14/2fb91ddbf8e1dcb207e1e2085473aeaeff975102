netfilter: nft_rbtree: fix data handling of end interval elements

This patch fixes several things which related to the handling of
end interval elements:

* Chain use underflow with intervals and map: If you add a rule
  using intervals+map that introduces a loop, the error path of the
  rbtree set decrements the chain refcount for each side of the
  interval, leading to a chain use counter underflow.

* Don't copy the data part of the end interval element since, this
  area is uninitialized and this confuses the loop detection code.

* Don't allocate room for the data part of end interval elements
  since this is unused.

So, after this patch the idea is that end interval elements don't
have a data part.
