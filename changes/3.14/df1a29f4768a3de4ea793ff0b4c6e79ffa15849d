ARM: dts: omap3-tobi: Fix boot with OMAP36xx-based Overo

Tobi expansion board can be used with both OMAP35xx-based Overo,
and OMAP36xx-based Overo. Currently the boot is broken with newer
OMAP36xx-based Overo (Storm and alike). Fix include file and
compatible string to be able to boot newer models.

This will break older models. This will be addressed later.
