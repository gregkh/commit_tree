KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Basic little-endian guest support

We create a guest MSR from scratch when delivering exceptions in
a few places.  Instead of extracting LPCR[ILE] and inserting it
into MSR_LE each time, we simply create a new variable intr_msr which
contains the entire MSR to use.  For a little-endian guest, userspace
needs to set the ILE (interrupt little-endian) bit in the LPCR for
each vcpu (or at least one vcpu in each virtual core).

[paulus@samba.org - removed H_SET_MODE implementation from original
version of the patch, and made kvmppc_set_lpcr update vcpu->arch.intr_msr.]
