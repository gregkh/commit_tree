iio: Add Freescale MPL3115A2 pressure / temperature sensor driver

I2C-controlled MEMS sensor with 20-bit pressure measurement (pascal) and
12-bit temperature measurement

driver only exposes basic functionality, see TODO remarks
datasheet: http://cache.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/data_sheet/MPL3115A2.pdf

v2:
* store 20-bit value in 32-bit buffer element (instead of 24-bit)
* zero buffer to prevent kernel data leak to userspace
* fix mutex unlock in trigger handler (thanks Andi Shyti)
