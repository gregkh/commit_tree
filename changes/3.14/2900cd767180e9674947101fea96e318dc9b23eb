gpu: ion: Loop on the handle count when destroying

When destroying a handle, all kernel mappings to that handle
should be destroyed. Other handles may still have references
and valid mappings to the buffer underneath which should not
be destroyed. Loop on the handle reference count, not the buffer
reference count to get rid of all kernel mappings for the handle.
