spi/pxa2xx: fix compilation warning when !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP

CONFIG_PM will be set if either or both CONFIG_PM_SLEEP and
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is set. Compiling the driver with !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP causes
following compilation warning:

drivers/spi/spi-pxa2xx.c:1270:12: warning: ‘pxa2xx_spi_suspend’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

Fix this by using CONFIG_PM_SLEEP instead.
