firmware: Suppress fallback warnings when CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER=n

The commit [3e358ac2bb5b: firmware: Be a bit more verbose about direct
firmware loading failure] introduced a new warning message about
falling back to user helper, but this isn't true when
CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER isn't set.

In this patch, clear the FW_OPT_FALLBACK flag in the case without
userhelper, so that the corresponding code will be disabled.
