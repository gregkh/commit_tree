Revert "xen: properly account for _PAGE_NUMA during xen pte translations"

This reverts commit a9c8e4beeeb64c22b84c803747487857fe424b68.

PTEs in Xen PV guests must contain machine addresses if _PAGE_PRESENT
is set and pseudo-physical addresses is _PAGE_PRESENT is clear.

This is because during a domain save/restore (migration) the page
table entries are "canonicalised" and uncanonicalised". i.e., MFNs are
converted to PFNs during domain save so that on a restore the page
table entries may be rewritten with the new MFNs on the destination.
This canonicalisation is only done for PTEs that are present.

This change resulted in writing PTEs with MFNs if _PAGE_PROTNONE (or
_PAGE_NUMA) was set but _PAGE_PRESENT was clear.  These PTEs would be
migrated as-is which would result in unexpected behaviour in the
destination domain.  Either a) the MFN would be translated to the
wrong PFN/page; b) setting the _PAGE_PRESENT bit would clear the PTE
because the MFN is no longer owned by the domain; or c) the present
bit would not get set.

Symptoms include "Bad page" reports when munmapping after migrating a
domain.
