crypto: omap-sham - Only release DMA channel if successfully requested

In omap_sham_probe() and omap_sham_remove(), 'dd->dma_lch'
is released without checking to see if it was successfully
requested or not.  This is a bug and was identified and
reported by Dan Carpenter here:

Add code to only release 'dd->dma_lch' when its not NULL
(that is, when it was successfully requested).
