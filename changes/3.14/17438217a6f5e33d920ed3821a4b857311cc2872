serial: pl011: use DMA RX polling by default

Making DMA RX polling optional when DMA is on was just
over-cautious: there is one single system in the kernel tree
using this facility, Ux500 and after some testing I turned
this on also for Ux500, which means it should simply be on
by default if DMA is enabled.
