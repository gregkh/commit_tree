xen/pvh: Setup up shared_info.

For PVHVM the shared_info structure is provided via the same way
as for normal PV guests (see include/xen/interface/xen.h).

That is during bootup we get 'xen_start_info' via the %esi register
in startup_xen. Then later we extract the 'shared_info' from said
structure (in xen_setup_shared_info) and start using it.

The 'xen_setup_shared_info' is all setup to work with auto-xlat
guests, but there are two functions which it calls that are not:
xen_setup_mfn_list_list and xen_setup_vcpu_info_placement.
This patch modifies the P2M code (xen_setup_mfn_list_list)
while the "Piggyback on PVHVM for event channels" modifies
the xen_setup_vcpu_info_placement.
