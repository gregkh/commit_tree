iio: mxs-lradc: compute temperature from channel 8 and 9

The mxs LRADC is able to read an internal die temperature sensor. The
temperature has to be calculated from the value read on channel 8 and channel 9.
To be able to expose the result to hwmon, implement iio channel 8 as
(channel 9 - channel 8). Then, implement IIO_CHAN_INFO_SCALE and
IIO_CHAN_INFO_OFFSET so that it can be processed by hwmon through the in kernel
provider/consumer mechanism.
