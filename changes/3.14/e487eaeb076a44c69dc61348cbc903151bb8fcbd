cfg80211/mac80211/ath6kl: acquire wdev lock outside ch_switch_notify

The channel switch notification should be sent under the
wdev/sdata-lock, preferably in the same moment as the channel change
happens, to avoid races by other callers (e.g. start/stop_ap).
This also adds the previously missing sdata_lock protection in
csa_finalize_work.
