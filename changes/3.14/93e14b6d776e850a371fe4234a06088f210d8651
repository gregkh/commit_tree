tun: add device name(iff) field to proc fdinfo entry

A file descriptor opened for /dev/net/tun and a tun device are
connected with ioctl.  Though understanding the connection is
important for trouble shooting, no way is given to a user to know
the connected device for a given file descriptor at userland.

This patch adds a new fdinfo field for the device name connected to
a file descriptor opened for /dev/net/tun.

Here is an example of the field:

    # lsof | grep tun
    qemu-syst 4565         qemu   25u      CHR             10,200       0t138      12921 /dev/net/tun
    ...

    # cat /proc/4565/fdinfo/25
    pos:	138
    flags:	0104002
    iff:	vnet0

    # ip link show dev vnet0
    8: vnet0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 ...

changelog:

    v2: indent iff just like the other fdinfo fields are.
    v3: remove unused variable.
        Both are suggested by David Miller <davem@davemloft.net>.
