Btrfs: fix memory leaks on walking backrefs failure

When walking backrefs, we may iterate every inode's extent
and add/merge them into ulist, and the caller will free memory
from ulist.

However, if we fail to allocate inode's extents element
memory or ulist_add() fail to allocate memory, we won't
add allocated memory into ulist, and the caller won't
free some allocated memory thus memory leaks happen.
