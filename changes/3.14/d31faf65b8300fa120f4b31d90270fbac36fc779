drm/i915: Fix scanoutpos calculations for interlaced modes

The scanline counter counts lines in the current field, not the entire
frame. But the crtc_ timings are the values for the entire frame. Divide
the vertical timings by 2 to make them match the scanline counter.

The rounding was carefully chosen to make it do the right thing wrt. the
observed scanline counter and ISR vblank bit behaviour.
