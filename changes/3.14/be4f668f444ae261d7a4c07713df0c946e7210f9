ARM: S3C64XX: Correct card detect type for HSMMC1 for MINI6410

According to board schematics, for HSMMC1 a GPIO line is used to detect
card presence, while currently it is being configured for internal card
detect line, which is multiplexed with card detect line of HSMMC0 and
thus breaking it.

This patch adds proper sdhci platform data setting card detect type to
external GPIO and fixing operation of HSMMC0.
