staging/lustre/llite: don't check for O_CREAT in it_create_mode

ll_lookup_it() checks for O_CREAT in struct lookup_intent's
it_create_mode member which is nonsensical, as it_create_mode is used
for file mode bits (S_IFREG, S_IRUSR, ...). Fix this by just checking
for IT_CREATE in it_op. This will not affect the behavior of either
function, since if O_CREATE (0100) is actually set in o_create_mode
then IT_CREATE must have been set in it_op. In ll_atomic_open() check
for O_CREAT in the open_flags parameter rather than testing mode.
