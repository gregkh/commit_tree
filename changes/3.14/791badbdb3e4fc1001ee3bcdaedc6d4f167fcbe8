memcg: convert away from cftype->read() and ->read_map()

In preparation of conversion to kernfs, cgroup file handling is being
consolidated so that it can be easily mapped to the seq_file based
interface of kernfs.

cftype->read_map() doesn't add any value and being replaced with
->read_seq_string(), and all users of cftype->read() can be easily
served, usually better, by seq_file and other methods.

Update mem_cgroup_read() to return u64 instead of printing itself and
rename it to mem_cgroup_read_u64(), and update
mem_cgroup_oom_control_read() to use ->read_seq_string() instead of
->read_map().

This patch doesn't make any visible behavior changes.
