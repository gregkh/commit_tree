drm/ttm: Work around performance regression with VM_PFNMAP

A performance regression was introduced in TTM in linux 3.13 when we started using
VM_PFNMAP for shared mappings. In theory this should've been faster due to
less page book-keeping but it appears like VM_PFNMAP + x86 PAT + write-combine
is a particularly cpu-hungry combination, as seen by largely increased
cpu-usage on r200 GL video playback.

Until we've sorted out why, revert to always use VM_MIXEDMAP.
