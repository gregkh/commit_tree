turbostat: Use GCC's CPUID functions to support PIC

turbostat uses inline assembly to call cpuid.  On 32-bit x86, on systems
that have certain security features enabled by default that make -fPIC
the default, this causes a build error:

turbostat.c: In function ‘check_cpuid’:
turbostat.c:1906:2: error: PIC register clobbered by ‘ebx’ in ‘asm’
  asm("cpuid" : "=a" (fms), "=c" (ecx), "=d" (edx) : "a" (1) : "ebx");
  ^

GCC provides a header cpuid.h, containing a __get_cpuid function that
works with both PIC and non-PIC.  (On PIC, it saves and restores ebx
around the cpuid instruction.)  Use that instead.
