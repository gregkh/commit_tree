dma-buf: update debugfs output

Russell King observed 'wierd' looking output from debugfs, and also suggested
better ways of getting device names (use KBUILD_MODNAME, dev_name())

This patch addresses these issues to make the debugfs output correct and better
looking.

While at it, replace seq_printf with seq_puts to remove the checkpatch.pl
warnings.
