xen/pvh: MMU changes for PVH (v2)

.. which are surprisingly small compared to the amount for PV code.

PVH uses mostly native mmu ops, we leave the generic (native_*) for
the majority and just overwrite the baremetal with the ones we need.

At startup, we are running with pre-allocated page-tables
courtesy of the tool-stack. But we still need to graft them
in the Linux initial pagetables. However there is no need to
unpin/pin and change them to R/O or R/W.

Note that the xen_pagetable_init due to 7836fec9d0994cc9c9150c5a33f0eb0eb08a335a
"xen/mmu/p2m: Refactor the xen_pagetable_init code." does not
need any changes - we just need to make sure that xen_post_allocator_init
does not alter the pvops from the default native one.
