staging: comedi: cancel commands before detaching device

The comedi core module's handling of the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl will
not allow a device to be detached if it is busy.  However, comedi
devices can also be auto-detached due to a removal of a hardware device.
One of the things we should do in that case is cancel any asynchronous
commands that are running.  Add a new function
`comedi_device_cancel_all()` to do that and call it from
`comedi_device_detach()`.
