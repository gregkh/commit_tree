bnx2x: namespace and dead code cleanups

Fix a bunch of whole lot of namespace issues with the Broadcom bnx2x driver
found by running 'make namespacecheck'

 * global variables must be prefixed with bnx2x_
    naming a variable int_mode, or num_queue is invitation to disaster

 * make local functions static

 * move some inline's used in one file out of header
   (this driver has a bad case of inline-itis)

 * remove resulting dead code fallout
 	 bnx2x_pfc_statistic,
	 bnx2x_emac_get_pfc_stat
 	 bnx2x_init_vlan_mac_obj,
   Looks like vlan mac support in this driver was a botch from day one
   either never worked, or not implemented or missing support functions

Compile tested only.
