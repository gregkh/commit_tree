rcu: Add comment on evaluate-once properties of rcu_assign_pointer().

The rcu_assign_pointer() macro, as with most cpp macros, must not evaluate
its argument more than once.  And it in fact does not.  But this might
not be obvious to the casual observer, because one of the arguments
appears no less than three times.  However, but one expansion is only
visible to sparse (__CHECKER__), and one lives inside a typeof (where
it will never be evaluated), so this is in fact safe.

This commit therefore adds a comment making this explicit.
