ASoC: ux500: Dramatically reduce the size of the DAI driver data struct

We no longer have a means to differentiate between MSP devices at probe
time, mainly because we don't really have to. So rather than have an over-
sized static data structure in place, where the only difference between
devices is the ID and name (which are unused), we'll just create one
succinct, statically assigned and shared one instead.
