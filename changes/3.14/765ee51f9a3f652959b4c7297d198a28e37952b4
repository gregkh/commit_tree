Revert "EISA: Initialize device before its resources"

This reverts commit 26abfeed4341872364386c6a52b9acef8c81a81a.

In the eisa_probe() force_probe path, if we were unable to request slot
resources (e.g., [io 0x800-0x8ff]), we skipped the slot with "Cannot
allocate resource for EISA slot %d" before reading the EISA signature in
eisa_init_device().

Commit 26abfeed4341 moved eisa_init_device() earlier, so we tried to read
the EISA signature before requesting the slot resources, and this caused
hangs during boot.
