bonding: Use RCU_INIT_POINTER() for better overhead and for sparse

Although rcu_assign_pointer() can be used to assign a constant
NULL pointer, doing so gets you an unnecessary memory barrier and
in some circumstances, sparse warnings.  This commit therefore
changes the rcu_assign_pointer() of NULL in __bond_release_one() to
RCU_INIT_POINTER().
