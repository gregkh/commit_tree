MIPS: asm: syscall: Fix copying system call arguments

The syscall_get_arguments function expects the arguments to be copied
to the '*args' argument but instead a local variable was used to hold
the system call argument. As a result of which, this variable was
never passed to the filter and any filter testing the system call
arguments would fail. This is fixed by passing the '*args' variable
as the destination memory for the system call arguments.
