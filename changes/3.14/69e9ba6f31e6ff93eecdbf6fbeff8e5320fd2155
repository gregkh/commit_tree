[media] adv7842: support YCrCb analog input, receive CEA formats as RGB on VGA input

Added support for YCrCb analog input.

If input is ADV7842_MODE_RGB and RGB quantization range is set to
V4L2_DV_RGB_RANGE_AUTO, then video with CEA timings will be received
as RGB. For ADV7842_MODE_COMP, automatic CSC mode will be selected.

See table 48 on page 281 in "ADV7842 Hardware Manual, Rev. 0, January 2011"
for details.

Make sure that when switching inputs the RGB quantization range is
updated as well.

Also updated the platform_data in ezkit to ensure that what was the old
default value is now explicitly specified, so the behavior for that board
is unchanged.
