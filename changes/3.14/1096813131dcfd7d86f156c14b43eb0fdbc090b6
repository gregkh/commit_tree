Fix select-induced Kconfig warning for ZBOOT_ROM

warning: (ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM && ARCH_CLPS711X && ARCH_PXA &&
 SOC_EXYNOS5440 && ARCH_EMEV2) selects AUTO_ZRELADDR which
 has unmet direct dependencies (!ZBOOT_ROM)

This is because it's possible to have ZBOOT_ROM enabled, but at the
same time have another option enabled which selects AUTO_ZRELADDR
overriding the !ZBOOT_ROM dependency.  Fix this by reversing the
dependencies between ZBOOT_ROM and the options which depend on
!ZBOOT_ROM.
