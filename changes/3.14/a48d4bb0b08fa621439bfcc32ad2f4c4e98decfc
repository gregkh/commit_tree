net: netdev_kobject_init: annotate with __init

netdev_kobject_init() is only being called from __init context,
that is, net_dev_init(), so annotate it with __init as well, thus
the kernel can take this as a hint that the function is used only
during the initialization phase and free up used memory resources
after its invocation.
