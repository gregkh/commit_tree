drivers: tty: Mark the functions as static in n_gsm.c

Marks the functions gsm_cleanup_mux(), gsm_activate_mux(),
gsm_free_mux(), gsm_alloc_mux() and gsm_change_mtu() as static in
n_gsm.c because they are not used outside this file.

Also, drop the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for the above mentioned functions
because nothing else in the kernel calls them.

This eliminates the following warnings in n_gsm.c:
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:2022:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘gsm_cleanup_mux’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:2076:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘gsm_activate_mux’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:2120:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘gsm_free_mux’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:2156:17: warning: no previous prototype for ‘gsm_alloc_mux’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:2714:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘gsm_change_mtu’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
