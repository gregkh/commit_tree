Bluetooth: Limit L2CAP_OPTIONS socket option usage with LE

Most of the values in L2CAP_OPTIONS are not applicable for LE and those
that are have different semantics. It makes therefore sense to
completely block this socket option for LE and add (in a separate patch)
a new socket option for tweaking the values that do make sense (mainly
the send and receive MTU). Legacy user space ATT code still depends on
getsockopt for L2CAP_OPTIONS though so we need to plug a hole for that
for backwards compatibility.
