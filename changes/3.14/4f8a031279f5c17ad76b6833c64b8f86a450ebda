rcutorture: Abstract qemu-flavor identification

The task of working out which flavor of qemu to use gets more complex
as more types of CPUs are supported.  Adding Power makes three in addition
to 32-bit and 64-bit x86, so it is time to pull this out into a function.
This commit therefore creates an identify_qemu function and also adds
a --qemu-cmd command-line argument for the inevitable case where the
identify_qemu cannot figure it out.
