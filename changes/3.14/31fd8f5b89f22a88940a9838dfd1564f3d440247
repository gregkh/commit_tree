dma: mv_xor: Silence a bunch of LPAE-related warnings

Enabling some of the mvebu platforms in the multiplatform config for ARM
enabled these drivers, which also triggered a bunch of warnings when LPAE
is enabled (thus making phys_addr_t 64-bit).

Most changes are switching printk formats, but also a bit of changes to what
used to be array-based pointer arithmetic that could just be done with the
address types instead.

The warnings were:

drivers/dma/mv_xor.c: In function 'mv_xor_tx_submit':
drivers/dma/mv_xor.c:500:3: warning: format '%x' expects argument of type
    'unsigned int', but argument 4 has type 'dma_addr_t' [-Wformat]
