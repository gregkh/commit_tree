mfd: twl-core: API to set the regcache bypass for a given regmap in twl

If the regcache is enabled on the regmap module drivers might need to access
to HW register(s) in certain cases in cache bypass mode.
As an example of this is the audio block's ANAMICL register. In normal
operation the content can be cached but during initialization one bit from
the register need to be monitored. With the twl_set_regcache_bypass() the
client driver can switch regcache bypass on and off when it is needed so
we can utilize the regcache for more registers.
