Btrfs: return immediately if tree log mod is not necessary

In ctree.c:tree_mod_log_set_node_key() we were calling
__tree_mod_log_insert_key() even when the modification doesn't need
to be logged. This would allocate a tree_mod_elem structure, fill it
and pass it to  __tree_mod_log_insert(), which would just acquire
the tree mod log write lock and then free the tree_mod_elem structure
and return (that is, a no-op).

Therefore call tree_mod_log_insert() instead of __tree_mod_log_insert()
which just returns immediately if the modification doesn't need to be
logged (without allocating the structure, fill it, acquire write lock,
free structure).
