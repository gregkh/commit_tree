OMAPDSS: DISPC: Fix 34xx overlay scaling calculation

commit 7faa92339bbb1e6b9a80983b206642517327eb75 OMAPDSS: DISPC: Handle
synclost errors in OMAP3 introduces limits check to prevent SYNCLOST errors
on OMAP3. However, it misses the logic found in Nokia kernels that is
needed to correctly calculate whether 3 tap or 5 tap rescaler to be used as
well as the logic to fallback to 3 taps if 5 taps clock results in too
tight horizontal timings. Without that patch "horizontal timing too tight"
errors are seen when a video with resolution above 640x350 is tried to be
played. The patch is a forward-ported logic found in Nokia N900 and N9/50
kernels.
