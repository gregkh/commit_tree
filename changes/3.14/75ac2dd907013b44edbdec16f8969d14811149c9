btrfs: expand btrfs_find_item() to include find_root_ref functionality

This patch is the second step in bootstrapping the btrfs_find_item
interface. The btrfs_find_root_ref() is similar to the former
__inode_info(); it accepts four of its parameters, and duplicates the
first half of its functionality.

Replace the one former call to btrfs_find_root_ref() with a call to
btrfs_find_item(), along with the defined key type that was used
internally by btrfs_find_root ref, and a null found key. In
btrfs_find_item(), add a test for the null key at the place where
the functionality of btrfs_find_root_ref() ends; btrfs_find_item()
then returns if the test passes. Finally, remove btrfs_find_root_ref().
