mm: sl[uo]b: fix misleading comments

On x86, SLUB creates and handles <=8192-byte allocations internally.
It passes larger ones up to the allocator.  Saying "up to order 2" is,
at best, ambiguous.  Is that order-1?  Or (order-2 bytes)?  Make
it more clear.

SLOB commits a similar sin.  It *handles* page-size requests, but the
comment says that it passes up "all page size and larger requests".

SLOB also swaps around the order of the very-similarly-named
KMALLOC_SHIFT_HIGH and KMALLOC_SHIFT_MAX #defines.  Make it
consistent with the order of the other two allocators.
