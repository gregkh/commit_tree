arm64: kernel: add PM build infrastructure

This patch adds the required makefile and kconfig entries to enable PM
for arm64 systems.

The kernel relies on the cpu_{suspend}/{resume} infrastructure to
properly save the context for a CPU and put it to sleep, hence this
patch adds the config option required to enable cpu_{suspend}/{resume}
API.

In order to rely on the CPU PM implementation for saving and restoring
of CPU subsystems like GIC and PMU, the arch Kconfig must be also
augmented to select the CONFIG_CPU_PM option when SUSPEND or CPU_IDLE
kernel implementations are selected.
