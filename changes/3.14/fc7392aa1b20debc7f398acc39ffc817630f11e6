Input: don't modify the id of ioctl-provided ff effect on upload failure

If a new (id == -1) ff effect was uploaded from userspace,
ff-core.c::input_ff_upload() will have assigned a positive number to the
new effect id.  Currently, evdev.c::evdev_do_ioctl() will save this new id
to userspace, regardless of whether the upload succeeded or not.

On upload failure, this can be confusing because the dev->ff->effects[]
array will not contain an element at the index of that new effect id.

This patch fixes this by leaving the id unchanged after upload fails.

Note: Unfortunately applications should still expect changed effect id for
quite some time.

This has been discussed on:
