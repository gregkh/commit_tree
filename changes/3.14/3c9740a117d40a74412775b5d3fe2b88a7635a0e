usb: hcd: move controller wakeup setting initialization to individual driver

Individual controller driver has different requirement for wakeup
setting, so move it from core to itself. In order to align with
current etting the default wakeup setting is enabled (except for
chipidea host).

Pass compile test with below commands:
	make O=outout/all allmodconfig
	make -j$CPU_NUM O=outout/all drivers/usb
