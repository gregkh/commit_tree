KVM: s390: ioeventfd: ignore leftmost bits

The diagnose 500 subcode 3 contains the 32 bit subchannel id in bits 32-63
(counting from the left). As for other I/O instructions, bits 0-31 should be
ignored and thus not be passed to kvm_io_bus_write_cookie().

This fixes a bug where the guest passed non-zero bits 0-31 which the
host tried to interpret, leading to ioeventfd notification failures.
