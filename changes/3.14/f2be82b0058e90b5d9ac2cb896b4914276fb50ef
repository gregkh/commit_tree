libceph: fix preallocation check in get_reply()

The check that makes sure that we have enough memory allocated to read
in the entire header of the message in question is currently busted.
It compares front_len of the incoming message with iov_len field of
ceph_msg::front structure, which is used primarily to indicate the
amount of data already read in, and not the size of the allocated
buffer.  Under certain conditions (e.g. a short read from a socket
followed by that socket's shutdown and owning ceph_connection reset)
this results in a warning similar to

[85688.975866] libceph: get_reply front 198 > preallocated 122 (4#0)

and, through another bug, leads to forever hung tasks and forced
reboots.  Fix this by comparing front_len with front_alloc_len field of
struct ceph_msg, which stores the actual size of the buffer.
