cpufreq: Add boost frequency support in core

This commit adds boost frequency support in cpufreq core (Hardware &
Software). Some SoCs (like Exynos4 - e.g. 4x12) allow setting frequency
above its normal operation limits. Such mode shall be only used for a
short time.

Overclocking (boost) support is essentially provided by platform
dependent cpufreq driver.

This commit unifies support for SW and HW (Intel) overclocking solutions
in the core cpufreq driver. Previously the "boost" sysfs attribute was
defined in the ACPI processor driver code. By default boost is disabled.
One global attribute is available at: /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost.

It only shows up when cpufreq driver supports overclocking.
Under the hood frequencies dedicated for boosting are marked with a
special flag (CPUFREQ_BOOST_FREQ) at driver's frequency table.
It is the user's concern to enable/disable overclocking with a proper call
to sysfs.

The cpufreq_boost_trigger_state() function is defined non static on purpose.
It is used later with thermal subsystem to provide automatic enable/disable
of the BOOST feature.
