kbuild: don't enable DEBUG_INFO when building for COMPILE_TEST

It really isn't very interesting to have DEBUG_INFO when doing compile
coverage stuff (you wouldn't want to run the result anyway, that's kind
of the whole point of COMPILE_TEST), and it currently makes the build
take longer and use much more disk space for "all{yes,mod}config".

There's somewhat active discussion about this still, and we might end up
with some new config option for things like this (Andi points out that
the silly X86_DECODER_SELFTEST option also slows down the normal
coverage tests hugely), but I'm starting the ball rolling with this
simple one-liner.

DEBUG_INFO isn't that noticeable if you have tons of memory and a good
IO subsystem, but it hurts you a lot if you don't - for very little
upside for the common use.
