mm/slub.c: list_lock may not be held in some circumstances

Commit c65c1877bd68 ("slub: use lockdep_assert_held") incorrectly
required that add_full() and remove_full() hold n->list_lock.  The lock
is only taken when kmem_cache_debug(s), since that's the only time it
actually does anything.

Require that the lock only be taken under such a condition.
