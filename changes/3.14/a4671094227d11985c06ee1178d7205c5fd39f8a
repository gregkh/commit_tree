MIPS: ftrace: Fix icache flush range error

In 32-bit mode, the start address passed to flush_icache_range is
shifted by 4 bytes before the second safe_store_code() call.

This causes system crash from time to time because the first 4 bytes
might not be flushed properly. This bug exists since linux-3.8.

Also remove obsoleted comment while at it.
