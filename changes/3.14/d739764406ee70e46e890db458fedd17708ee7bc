i40e: Fix ring allocation

The allocation and clearing of rings for a VSI should be
using the alloc_queue_pairs and not num_queue_pairs.

The alloc_queue_pairs per VSI is a pre-allocated number
of queues assigned to a VSI; based on number of TCs enabled
only certain number of queues may be used from that. This
is mainly valid only for the LAN VSI case as that is the
only VSI that may be enabled with multiple traffic classes.
In the future the number of TCs may change based on DCBX
configuration.

The actual number of queues that are enabled/configured is
based on the number of TCs enabled for a given VSI and that
is stored in num_queue_pairs.

With this change num_[tr]x_queues is unused so remove them.
