f2fs: add a sysfs entry to control max_discards

If frequent small discards are issued to the device, the performance would
be degraded significantly.
So, this patch adds a sysfs entry to control the number of discards to be
issued during a checkpoint procedure.

By default, f2fs does not issue any small discards, which means max_discards
is zero.
