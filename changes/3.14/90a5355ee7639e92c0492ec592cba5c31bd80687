KVM: arm-vgic: Add GICD_SPENDSGIR and GICD_CPENDSGIR handlers

Handle MMIO accesses to the two registers which should support both the
case where the VMs want to read/write either of these registers and the
case where user space reads/writes these registers to do save/restore of
the VGIC state.

Note that the added complexity compared to simple set/clear enable
registers stems from the bookkeping of source cpu ids.  It may be
possible to change the underlying data structure to simplify the
complexity, but since this is not in the critical path at all, this will
do.

Also note that reading this register from a live guest will not be
accurate compared to on hardware, because some state may be living on
the CPU LRs and the only way to give a consistent read would be to force
stop all the VCPUs and request them to unqueu the LR state onto the
distributor.  Until we have an actual user of live reading this
register, we can live with the difference.
