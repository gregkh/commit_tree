NFC: pn544: Refactor hw_config values

Some of the EEPROM configurations that are assigned by the PN544 driver
are set by the firmware and should not be modified by the driver. Others
are certain user mode configurations that are currently getting set to values
that shouldn't necessarily be dictated by the driver. This patch changes
most user and system mode configurations to the firmware defaults.
