[media] m88rs2000: set symbol rate accurately

Current setting of symbol rate is not very actuate causing
loss of lock.

Covert temp to u64 and use mclk to calculate from big number.

Calculate symbol rate by dividing symbol rate by 1000 times
1 << 24 and dividing sum by mclk.

Add other symbol rate settings to function registers 0xa0-0xa3.

In set_frontend add changes to register 0xf1 this must be done
prior call to fe_reset. Register 0x00 doesn't need a second
write of 0x1

Applied after patch
