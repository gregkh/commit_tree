Btrfs: wrap repeated code into scrub_blocked_if_needed()

Just wrap same code into one function scrub_blocked_if_needed().

This make a change that we will move waiting (@workers_pending = 0)
before we can wake up commiting transaction(atomic_inc(@scrub_paused)),
we must take carefully to not deadlock here.

				|->btrfs_commit_transaction()

					|->btrfs_scrub_paused()(blocked)
|->join_transaction(blocked)

Move btrfs_scrub_paused() before setting trans type which means we can
still join a transaction when commiting_transaction is blocked.
