ALSA: hda - Fix loud click noise with IdeaPad 410Y

Lenovo IdeaPad 410Y with ALC282 codec makes loud click noises at boot
and shutdown.  Also, it wrongly misdetects the acpi_thinkpad hook.
This patch adds a device-specific fixup for disabling the shutup
callback that is the cause of the click noise and also avoiding the
thinpad_helper calls.
