ipv4: fix wildcard search with inet_confirm_addr()

Help of this function says: "in_dev: only on this interface, 0=any interface",
but since commit 39a6d0630012 ("[NETNS]: Process inet_confirm_addr in the
correct namespace."), the code supposes that it will never be NULL. This
function is never called with in_dev == NULL, but it's exported and may be used
by an external module.

Because this patch restore the ability to call inet_confirm_addr() with in_dev
== NULL, I partially revert the above commit, as suggested by Julian.
