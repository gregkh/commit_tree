liblockdep: Wrap kernel/locking/lockdep.c to allow usage from userspace

kernel/locking/lockdep.c deals with validating locking scenarios for
various architectures supported by the kernel. There isn't
anything kernel specific going on in lockdep, and when we
compare userspace to other architectures that don't have to deal
with irqs such as s390, they become all too similar.

We wrap kernel/locking/lockdep.c and include/linux/lockdep.h with
several headers which allow us to build and use lockdep from
userspace. We don't touch the kernel code itself which means
that any work done on lockdep in the kernel will automatically
benefit userspace lockdep as well!
