drivers/tty/hvc: don't use module_init in non-modular hyp. console code

The HVC_OPAL/RTAS/UDBG/XEN options are all bool, and hence their support
is either present or absent.  It will never be modular, so using
module_init as an alias for __initcall is rather misleading.

Fix this up now, so that we can relocate module_init from
init.h into module.h in the future.  If we don't do this, we'd
have to add module.h to obviously non-modular code, and that
would be a worse thing.

Note that direct use of __initcall is discouraged, vs. one
of the priority categorized subgroups.  As __initcall gets
mapped onto device_initcall, our use of device_initcall
directly in this change means that the runtime impact is
zero -- it will remain at level 6 in initcall ordering.

Also the __exitcall functions have been outright deleted since
they are only ever of interest to UML, and UML will never be
using any of this code.
