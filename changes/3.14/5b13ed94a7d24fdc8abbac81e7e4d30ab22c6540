staging: comedi: add a kref to comedi device

Add a `struct kref refcount` member to `struct comedi_device` to allow
safe destruction of the comedi device.  Only free the comedi device via
the 'release' callback `kref_put()`.  Currently, nothing calls
`kref_put()`, so the safe destruction is ineffective, but this will be
addressed by later patches.
