MIPS: Malta: use generic 8250 early console

This patch switches Malta from using the MIPS implementation of early
printk with Malta's prom_putchar to using the generic 8250_early
implementation. This offers a couple of advantages:

  - We duplicate less generic code.

  - The UART can be initialised rather than being reliant upon
    inheriting a valid setup from the bootloader.

The Malta console_config function is extended to initialise the early
console if no earlycon= kernel parameter is provided, inheriting the
modetty0 bootloader environment if present and falling back to a
default 38400n8r setup if not. This matches the behaviour used for the
regular console= parameter.
