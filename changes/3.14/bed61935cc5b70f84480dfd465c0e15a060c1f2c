ALSA: oxygen: Xonar DG(X): add new CS4245 SPI functions

Add the new SPI write and read functions. The SPI read function
is used for creating initial registers dump and may be used for
debugging purposes. SPI operations are cached, so there is a new
function to manage the cache (shadow). I have to remove
the shift from the CS4245_SPI_* constants, since when
we are performing the reading, we need to shift by 8 instead
of 16.
