sysfs, kernfs: replace sysfs_dirent->s_dir.kobj and ->s_attr.[bin_]attr with ->priv

A directory sysfs_dirent points to the associated kobj.  A regular or
bin file points to the associated [bin_]attribute.  This patch
replaces sysfs_dirent->s_dir.kobj and ->s_attr.[bin_]attr with void *
->priv.

This is to prepare for kernfs interface so that sysfs can specify the
private data in the same way for directories and files.  This lower
debuggability but not by much - the whole thing was overlaid in a
union anyway.  If debuggability becomes an issue, we can later add
->priv accessors which explicitly check for the sysfs_dirent type and
performs casting.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior difference.
