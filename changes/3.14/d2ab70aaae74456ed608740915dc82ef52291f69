mm/memcg: fix last_dead_count memory wastage

Shorten mem_cgroup_reclaim_iter.last_dead_count from unsigned long to
int: it's assigned from an int and compared with an int, and adjacent to
an unsigned int: so there's no point to it being unsigned long, which
wasted 104 bytes in every mem_cgroup_per_zone.
