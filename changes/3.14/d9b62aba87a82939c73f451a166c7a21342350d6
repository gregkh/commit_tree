perf tools: Adjust kallsyms for relocated kernel

If the kernel is relocated at boot time, kallsyms will not match data
recorded previously.

That does not matter for modules because they are corrected anyway.  It
also does not matter if vmlinux is being used for symbols. But if perf
tools has only kallsyms then the symbols will not match.

Fix by applying the delta gained by comparing the old and current
addresses of the relocation reference symbol.
