x86/amd/numa: Fix northbridge quirk to assign correct NUMA node

For systems with multiple servers and routed fabric, all
northbridges get assigned to the first server. Fix this by also
using the node reported from the PCI bus. For single-fabric
systems, the northbriges are on PCI bus 0 by definition, which
are on NUMA node 0 by definition, so this is invarient on most
systems.

Tested on fam10h and fam15h single and multi-fabric systems and
candidate for stable.
