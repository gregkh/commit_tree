fs: Avoid userspace mounting anon_inodefs filesystem

anon_inodefs filesystem is a kernel internal filesystem userspace
shouldn't mess with. Remove registration of it so userspace cannot
even try to mount it (which would fail anyway because the filesystem is
MS_NOUSER).

This fixes an oops triggered by trinity when it tried mounting
anon_inodefs which overwrote anon_inode_inode pointer while other CPU
has been in anon_inode_getfile() between ihold() and d_instantiate().
Thus effectively creating dentry pointing to an inode without holding a
reference to it.
