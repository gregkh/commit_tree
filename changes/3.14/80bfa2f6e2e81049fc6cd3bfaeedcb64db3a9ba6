xen-blkif: drop struct blkif_request_segment_aligned

This was wrongly introduced in commit 402b27f9, the only difference
between blkif_request_segment_aligned and blkif_request_segment is
that the former has a named padding, while both share the same
memory layout.

Also correct a few minor glitches in the description, including for it
to no longer assume PAGE_SIZE == 4096.
