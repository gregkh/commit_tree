dma: pl330: Differentiate between submitted and issued descriptors

The pl330 dmaengine driver currently does not differentiate between submitted
and issued descriptors. It won't start transferring a newly submitted
descriptor until issue_pending() is called, but only if it is idle. If it is
active and a new descriptor is submitted before it goes idle it will happily
start the newly submitted descriptor once all earlier submitted descriptors have
been completed. This is not a 100% correct with regards to the dmaengine
interface semantics. A descriptor is not supposed to be started until the next
issue_pending() call after the descriptor has been submitted. This patch adds a
second per channel list that keeps track of the submitted descriptors. Once
issue_pending() is called the submitted descriptors are moved to the working
list and only descriptors on the working list are started.
