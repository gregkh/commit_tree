net_sched: optimize tcf_match_indev()

tcf_match_indev() is called in fast path, it is not wise to
search for a netdev by ifindex and then compare by its name,
just compare the ifindex.

Also, dev->name could be changed by user-space, therefore
the match would be always fail, but dev->ifindex could
be consistent.

BTW, this will also save some bytes from the core struct of u32.
