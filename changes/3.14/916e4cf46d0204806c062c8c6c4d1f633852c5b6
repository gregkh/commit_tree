ipv6: reuse ip6_frag_id from ip6_ufo_append_data

Currently we generate a new fragmentation id on UFO segmentation. It
is pretty hairy to identify the correct net namespace and dst there.
Especially tunnels use IFF_XMIT_DST_RELEASE and thus have no skb_dst
available at all.

This causes unreliable or very predictable ipv6 fragmentation id
generation while segmentation.

Luckily we already have pregenerated the ip6_frag_id in
ip6_ufo_append_data and can use it here.
