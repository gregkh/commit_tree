uprobes: Allocate ->utask before handler_chain() for tracing handlers

uprobe_trace_print() and uprobe_perf_print() need to pass the additional
info to call_fetch() methods, currently there is no simple way to do this.

current->utask looks like a natural place to hold this info, but we need
to allocate it before handler_chain().

This is a bit unfortunate, perhaps we will find a better solution later,
but this is simple and should work right now.
