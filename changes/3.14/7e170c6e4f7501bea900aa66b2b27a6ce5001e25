mfd: ti_am335x_tscadc: Don't read back REG_SE

The purpose of reg_se_cache has been defeated. It should avoid the
read-back of the register to avoid the latency and the fact that the
bits are reset to 0 after the individual conversation took place.

The reason why this is required like this to work, is that read-back of
the register removes the bits of the ADC so they do not start another
conversation after the register is re-written from the TSC side for the
update.
To avoid the not required read-back I introduce a "set once" variant which
does not update the cache mask. After the conversation completes, the
bit is removed from the SE register anyway and we don't plan a new
conversation "any time soon". The current set function is renamed to
set_cache to distinguish the two operations.
This is a small preparation for a larger sync-rework.
