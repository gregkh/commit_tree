cgroup: don't skip seq_open on write only opens on pidlist files

Currently, cgroup_pidlist_open() skips seq_open() and pidlist loading
if the file is opened write-only, which is a sensible optimization as
pidlist loading can be costly and there often are occasions where
tasks or cgroup.procs is opened write-only.  However, pidlist init and
release are planned to be moved to cgroup_pidlist_start/stop()
respectively which would make this optimization unnecessary.

This patch removes the optimization and always fully initializes
pidlist files regardless of open mode.  This will help moving pidlist
handling to start/stop by unifying rw paths and removes the need for
specifying cftype->release() in addition to .release in
cgroup_pidlist_operations as file->f_op is now always overridden.  As
pidlist files were the only user of cftype->release(), the next patch
will remove the method.
