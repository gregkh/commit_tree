dm cache: fix truncation bug when mapping I/O to >2TB fast device

When remapping a block to the cache's fast device that is larger than
2TB we must not truncate the destination sector to 32bits.  The 32bit
temporary result of from_cblock() was being overflowed in
remap_to_cache() due to the logical left shift.

Use an intermediate 64bit type to store the 32bit from_cblock() result
to fix the overflow.
