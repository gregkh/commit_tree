tipc: drop subscriber connection id invalidation

When a topology server subscriber is disconnected, the associated
connection id is set to zero. A check vs zero is then done in the
subscription timeout function to see if the subscriber have been
shut down. This is unnecessary, because all subscription timers
will be cancelled when a subscriber terminates. Setting the
connection id to zero is actually harmful because id zero is the
identity of the topology server listening socket, and can cause a
race that leads to this socket being closed instead.
