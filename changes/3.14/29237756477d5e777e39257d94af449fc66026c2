PCI/MSI: Fix leak of msi_attrs

Coverity reported that I forgot to clean up some allocated memory on the
error path in populate_msi_sysfs(), so this patch fixes that.

Thanks to Dave Jones for pointing out where the error was, I obviously
can't read code this morning...

Found by Coverity (CID 1163317).
