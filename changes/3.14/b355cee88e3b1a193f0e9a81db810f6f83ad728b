ACPI / resources: ignore invalid ACPI device resources

ACPI table may export resource entry with 0 length.
But the current code interprets this kind of resource in a wrong way.
It will create a resource structure with
res->end = acpi_resource->start + acpi_resource->len - 1;

This patch fixes a problem on my machine that a platform device fails
to be created because one of its ACPI IO resource entry (start = 0,
end = 0, length = 0) is translated into a generic resource with
start = 0, end = 0xffffffff.
