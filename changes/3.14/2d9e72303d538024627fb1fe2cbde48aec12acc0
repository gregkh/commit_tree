GFS2: Move quota bitmap operations under their own lock

Gradually, the global qd_lock is being used for less and less.
After this patch it will only be used for the per super block
list whose purpose is to allow syncing of changes back to the
master quota file from the local quota changes file. Fixing
up that process to make it more efficient will be the subject
of a later patch, however this patch removes another barrier
to doing that.
