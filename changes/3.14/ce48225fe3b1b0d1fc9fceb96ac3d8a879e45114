memcg: fix endless loop in __mem_cgroup_iter_next()

Commit 0eef615665ed ("memcg: fix css reference leak and endless loop in
mem_cgroup_iter") got the interaction with the commit a few before it
d8ad30559715 ("mm/memcg: iteration skip memcgs not yet fully
initialized") slightly wrong, and we didn't notice at the time.

It's elusive, and harder to get than the original, but for a couple of
days before rc1, I several times saw a endless loop similar to that
supposedly being fixed.

This time it was a tighter loop in __mem_cgroup_iter_next(): because we
can get here when our root has already been offlined, and the ordering
of conditions was such that we then just cycled around forever.
