staging: comedi: dt282x: tidy up the irq support in dt282x_attach()

An irq is only needed by this driver in order to support async commands.
Since it is optional, modify the attach so that if the request_irq() fails
the attach does not fail.

Remove the printk noise about the irq.

Only hookup the async command support if the request_irq() was successful.

Also, only call dt282x_grab_dma() if we have an irq since interrupt support
is needed to support dma.
