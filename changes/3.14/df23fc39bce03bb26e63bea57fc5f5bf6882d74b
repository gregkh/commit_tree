kernfs: s/sysfs/kernfs/ in constants

kernfs has just been separated out from sysfs and we're already in
full conflict mode.  Nothing can make the situation any worse.  Let's
take the chance to name things properly.

This patch performs the following renames.

* s/SYSFS_DIR/KERNFS_DIR/
* s/SYSFS_KOBJ_ATTR/KERNFS_FILE/
* s/SYSFS_KOBJ_LINK/KERNFS_LINK/
* s/SYSFS_{TYPE_FLAGS}/KERNFS_{TYPE_FLAGS}/
* s/SYSFS_FLAG_{FLAG}/KERNFS_{FLAG}/
* s/sysfs_type()/kernfs_type()/
* s/SD_DEACTIVATED_BIAS/KN_DEACTIVATED_BIAS/

This patch is strictly rename only and doesn't introduce any
functional difference.
