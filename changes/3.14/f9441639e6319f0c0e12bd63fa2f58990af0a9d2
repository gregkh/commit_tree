audit: fix netlink portid naming and types

Normally, netlink ports use the PID of the userspace process as the port ID.
If the PID is already in use by a port, the kernel will allocate another port
ID to avoid conflict.  Re-name all references to netlink ports from pid to
portid to reflect this reality and avoid confusion with actual PIDs.  Ports
use the __u32 type, so re-type all portids accordingly.

(This patch is very similar to ebiederman's 5deadd69)
