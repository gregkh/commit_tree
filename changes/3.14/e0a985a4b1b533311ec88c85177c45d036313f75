bcache: Improve bucket_prio() calculation

When deciding what order to reuse buckets we take into account both the bucket's
priority (which indicates lru order) and also the amount of live data in that
bucket. The way they were scaled together wasn't as correct as it could be...
this patch improves and documents it.
