ipw2x00: use ether_addr_equal_64bits

Ether_addr_equal_64bits is more efficient than ether_addr_equal, and can be
used when each argument is an array within a structure that contains at
least two bytes of data beyond the array.

The structure involved is
libipw_network defined in drivers/net/wireless/ipw2x00/libipw.h

This was done using Coccinelle (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/).
