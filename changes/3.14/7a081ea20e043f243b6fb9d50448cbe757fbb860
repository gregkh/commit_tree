staging: r8188eu: memory corruption handling long ssids

We should cap the SSID length at NDIS_802_11_LENGTH_SSID (32) characters
to avoid memory corruption.  If the SSID is too long then I have opted
to ignore it instead of truncating it.

We don't need to clear bssid->Ssid.Ssid[0] because this struct is
allocated with rtw_zmalloc()
