mm/rmap: make rmap_walk to get the rmap_walk_control argument

In each rmap traverse case, there is some difference so that we need
function pointers and arguments to them in order to handle these

For this purpose, struct rmap_walk_control is introduced in this patch,
and will be extended in following patch.  Introducing and extending are
separate, because it clarify changes.
