serial: sh-sci: Fix warnings due to improper casts and printk formats

Use the %zu and %pad printk specifiers to print size_t and dma_addr_t
variables, and cast pointers to uintptr_t instead of unsigned int where
applicable. This fixes warnings on platforms where pointers and/or
dma_addr_t have a different size than int.
