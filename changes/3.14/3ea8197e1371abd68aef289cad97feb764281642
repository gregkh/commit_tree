PCI: Remove unused Latency Tolerance Reporting support

My philosophy is unused code is dead code.  And dead code is subject to bit
rot and is a likely source of bugs.  Use it or lose it.

This reverts 51c2e0a7e5bc ("PCI: add latency tolerance reporting
enable/disable support"), removing these interfaces:

    pci_enable_ltr()
    pci_disable_ltr()
    pci_set_ltr()

[bhelgaas: split to separate patch, also remove prototypes from pci.h]
