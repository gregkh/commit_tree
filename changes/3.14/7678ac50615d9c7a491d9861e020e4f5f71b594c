fuse: support clients that don't implement 'open'

open/release operations require userspace transitions to keep track
of the open count and to perform any FS-specific setup.  However,
for some purely read-only FSs which don't need to perform any setup
at open/release time, we can avoid the performance overhead of
calling into userspace for open/release calls.

This patch adds the necessary support to the fuse kernel modules to prevent
open/release operations from hitting in userspace. When the client returns
ENOSYS, we avoid sending the subsequent release to userspace, and also
remember this so that future opens also don't trigger a userspace
operation.
