liblockdep: Add the 'lockdep' user-space utility

This is a simple wrapper to make using liblockdep on existing
applications much easier.

After running 'make && make install', it becomes quite simple to
test things with liblockdep. For example, to try it on perf:

	lockdep perf

No other integration required.

[ Changed it to load ./liblockdep.so, so it can be tested in situ. ]
