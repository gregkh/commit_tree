brcmfmac: only disable clock when brcmf_sdio_bus_init() fails

The condition to disable the clock at the end of brcmf_sdio_bus_init()
was wrong as the bus state is updated by the calling function. Hence,
the clock was always disabled after brcmf_sdio_bus_init() which was
not the intended behaviour.
