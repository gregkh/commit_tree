[media] s5p-jpeg: Fix erroneous condition while validating bytesperline value

The aim of the condition is ensuring that the bytesperline
value set by the user space application is proper for the
given format and adjusting it if isn't. As the depth value
of the format description entry is expressed in bits then
the bytesperline value needs to be divided, not multiplied,
by that value to get the number of bytes required to store
single line of image samples.
