Bluetooth: Release RFCOMM port when the last user closes the TTY

This patch fixes a userspace regression introduced by the commit
29cd718b.

If the rfcomm device was created with the flag RFCOMM_RELEASE_ONHUP the
user space expects that the tty_port is released as soon as the last
process closes the tty.

The current code attempts to release the port in the function
rfcomm_dev_state_change(). However it won't get a reference to the
relevant tty to send a HUP: at that point the tty is already destroyed
and therefore NULL.

This patch fixes the regression by taking over the tty refcount in the
tty install method(). This way the tty_port is automatically released as
soon as the tty is destroyed.

As a consequence the check for RFCOMM_RELEASE_ONHUP flag in the hangup()
method is now redundant. Instead we have to be careful with the reference
counting in the rfcomm_release_dev() function.
