[media] em28xx-audio: don't hardcode audio URB calculus

The current code hardcodes the number of audio URBs, the number
of packets per URB and the maximum URB size.

This is not a good idea, as it:

- wastes more bandwidth than necessary, by using a very
  large number of packets;

- those constants are bound to an specific scenario, with
  a bandwidth of 48 kHz;

- don't take the maximum endpoint size into account;

- with urb->interval = 1 on xHCI, those constraints cause a "funny"
  setup: URBs with 64 packets inside, with only 24 bytes total. E. g.
  a complete waste of space.

Change the code to do dynamic URB audio calculus and allocation.

For now, use the same constraints as used before this patch, to
avoid regressions.

A good scenario (tested) seems to use those defines, instead:

	#define EM28XX_MAX_AUDIO_BUFS          8
	#define EM28XX_MIN_AUDIO_PACKETS       2

But let's not do such change here, letting the optimization to
happen on latter patches, after more tests.
