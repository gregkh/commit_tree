blk-mq: use __smp_call_function_single directly

__smp_call_function_single already avoids multiple IPIs by internally
queing up the items, and now also is available for non-SMP builds as
a trivially correct stub, so there is no need to wrap it.  If the
additional lock roundtrip cause problems my patch to convert the
generic IPI code to llists is waiting to get merged will fix it.
