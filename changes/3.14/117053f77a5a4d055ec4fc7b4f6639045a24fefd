i2c: s3c2410: Add polling mode support

This patch adds polling mode support for i2c-s3c2410 driver.The
SATA PHY controller's CMU and TRSV block's are of I2C register
map in exynos5250.These blocks can be configured using i2c.

But i2c controller instance on which these block's sits lacks an
interrupt line.Also the current i2c-s3c2410 driver is only interrupt
driven, thus a polling mode support is required in the driver for
supporting this controller. This patch adds this support to the driver.
