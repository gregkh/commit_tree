virtio-net: correct error handling of virtqueue_kick()

Current error handling of virtqueue_kick() was wrong in two places:
- The skb were freed immediately when virtqueue_kick() fail during
  xmit. This may lead double free since the skb was not detached from
  the virtqueue.
- try_fill_recv() returns false when virtqueue_kick() fail. This will
  lead unnecessary rescheduling of refill work.

Actually, it's safe to just ignore the kick failure in those two
places. So this patch fixes this by partially revert commit
67975901183799af8e93ec60e322f9e2a1940b9b.

Fixes 67975901183799af8e93ec60e322f9e2a1940b9b
(virtio_net: verify if virtqueue_kick() succeeded).
