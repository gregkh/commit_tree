[SCSI] improved eh timeout handler

When a command runs into a timeout we need to send an 'ABORT TASK'
TMF. This is typically done by the 'eh_abort_handler' LLDD callback.

Conceptually, however, this function is a normal SCSI command, so
there is no need to enter the error handler.

This patch implements a new scsi_abort_command() function which
invokes an asynchronous function scsi_eh_abort_handler() to
abort the commands via the usual 'eh_abort_handler'.

If abort succeeds the command is either retried or terminated,
depending on the number of allowed retries. However, 'eh_eflags'
records the abort, so if the retry would fail again the
command is pushed onto the error handler without trying to
abort it (again); it'll be cleared up from SCSI EH.
