bridge: Properly check if local fdb entry can be deleted when deleting vlan

Vlan codes unconditionally delete local fdb entries.
We should consider the possibility that other ports have the same
address and vlan.

Example of problematic case:
  ip link set eth0 address 12:34:56:78:90:ab
  ip link set eth1 address aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
  brctl addif br0 eth0
  brctl addif br0 eth1 # br0 will have mac address 12:34:56:78:90:ab
  bridge vlan add dev eth0 vid 10
  bridge vlan add dev eth1 vid 10
  bridge vlan add dev br0 vid 10 self
We will have fdb entry such that f->dst == eth0, f->vlan_id == 10 and
f->addr == 12:34:56:78:90:ab at this time.
Next, delete eth0 vlan 10.
  bridge vlan del dev eth0 vid 10
In this case, we still need the entry for br0, but it will be deleted.

Note that br0 needs the entry even though its mac address is not set
manually. To delete the entry with proper condition checking,
fdb_delete_local() is suitable to use.
