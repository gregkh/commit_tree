crush: generalize descend_once

The legacy behavior is to make the normal number of tries for the
recursive chooseleaf call.  The descend_once tunable changed this to
making a single try and bail if we get a reject (note that it is
impossible to collide in the recursive case).

The new set_chooseleaf_tries lets you select the number of recursive
chooseleaf attempts for indep mode, or default to 1.  Use the same
behavior for firstn, except default to total_tries when the legacy
tunables are set (for compatibility).  This makes the rule step
override the (new) default of 1 recursive attempt, keeping behavior
consistent with indep mode.

Reflects ceph.git commit 685c6950ef3df325ef04ce7c986e36ca2514c5f1.
