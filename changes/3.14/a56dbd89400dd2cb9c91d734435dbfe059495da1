Btrfs: remove btrfs_end_transaction_dmeta()

Two reasons:
- btrfs_end_transaction_dmeta() is the same as btrfs_end_transaction_throttle()
  so it is unnecessary.
- All the delayed items should be dealt in the current transaction, so the
  workers should not commit the transaction, instead, deal with the delayed
  items as many as possible.

So we can remove btrfs_end_transaction_dmeta()
