i40e: release NVM resource reservation on startup

Call AQ to release any reservation held by this PF on the NVM resource
lock on startup, in order to clear anything that might have been left over from
a previous run.  The lock is only cleared by the requestor calling for it to be
cleared, on power-on, or firmware reset.  This should help limit the need for
rebooting a customer machine if something goes wrong on a firmware update or
some other action.
