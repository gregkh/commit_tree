net: netprio: rename config to be more consistent with cgroup configs

While we're at it and introduced CGROUP_NET_CLASSID, lets also make
NETPRIO_CGROUP more consistent with the rest of cgroups and rename it
into CONFIG_CGROUP_NET_PRIO so that for networking, we now have
CONFIG_CGROUP_NET_{PRIO,CLASSID}. This not only makes the CONFIG
option consistent among networking cgroups, but also among cgroups
CONFIG conventions in general as the vast majority has a prefix of
CONFIG_CGROUP_<SUBSYS>.
