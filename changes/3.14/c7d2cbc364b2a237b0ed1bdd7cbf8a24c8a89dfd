ocfs2: update inode size after zeroing the hole

fs-writeback will release the dirty pages without page lock whose offset
are over inode size, the release happens at
block_write_full_page_endio().  If not update, dirty pages in file holes
may be released before flushed to the disk, then file holes will contain
some non-zero data, this will cause sparse file md5sum error.

To reproduce the bug, find a big sparse file with many holes, like vm
image file, its actual size should be bigger than available mem size to
make writeback work more frequently, tar it with -S option, then keep
untar it and check its md5sum again and again until you get a wrong
md5sum.
