net: fix "queues" uevent between network namespaces

When I create a new namespace with 'ip netns add net0', or add/remove
new links in a namespace with 'ip link add/delete type veth', rx/tx
queues events can be got in all namespaces. That is because rx/tx queue
ktypes do not have namespace support, and their kobj parents are setted to
NULL. This patch is to fix it.
