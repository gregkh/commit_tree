USB: OHCI: Properly handle ohci-at91 suspend

Suspend scenario in case of ohci-at91 glue was not properly handled
as it was not suspending generic part of ohci controller. Alan Stern
suggested, properly handle ohci-at91 suspend scenario.

Calling explicitly the ohci_suspend() routine in ohci_hcd_at91_drv_suspend()
will ensure proper handling of suspend scenario. This task is sugested
by Alan Stern.
