staging: lustre: ptlrpc: clean up whitespace around braces

Fix the following types of checkpatch errors to comply with coding
style:

ERROR: space required after that close brace '}'
ERROR: space required before the open brace '{'

Also change "if (x == 0)" into "if (!x)" on one line, to avoid
introducing new checkpatch issues.
