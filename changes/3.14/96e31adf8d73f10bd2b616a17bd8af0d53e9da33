bna: Add NULL Check Before Dereferencing TCB

Currently we already check to see whether the BNAD_TXQ_TX_STARTED cleared.
But if the tcb structure which contains this flag is also already freed by that
time, we would dereference the NULL pointer. This patch is to check tcb for NULL
pointer, before dereferencing it.
