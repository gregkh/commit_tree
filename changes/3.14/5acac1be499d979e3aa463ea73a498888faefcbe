tick: Rename tick_check_idle() to tick_irq_enter()

This makes the code more symetric against the existing tick functions
called on irq exit: tick_irq_exit() and tick_nohz_irq_exit().

These function are also symetric as they mirror each other's action:
we start to account idle time on irq exit and we stop this accounting
on irq entry. Also the tick is stopped on irq exit and timekeeping
catches up with the tickless time elapsed until we reach irq entry.

This rename was suggested by Peter Zijlstra a long while ago but it
got forgotten in the mass.
