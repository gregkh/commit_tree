xen-netback: add gso_segs calculation

netback already has code which parses IPv4 and v6 headers to set up checksum
offsets and these are always applied to GSO packets being sent from
frontends. It's therefore suboptimal that GSOs are being marked
SKB_GSO_DODGY to defer the gso_segs calculation when netback already has all
necessary information to hand to do the calculation. This patch adds that
calculation.
