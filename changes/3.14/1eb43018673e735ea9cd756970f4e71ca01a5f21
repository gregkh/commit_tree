brcmfmac: fix txglomming scatter-gather packet transfers

The driver concatenates multiple packets in one MMC transfer. For
scatter-gather to work the total length need to be multiple of 512
bytes. A pre-allocated buffer was used to add padding to accomplish
that. However, the length was not properly set and it was freed after
the first transfer causing a crash.
