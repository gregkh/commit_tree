Bluetooth: Manually enable or disable 6LoWPAN between devices

This is a temporary patch where user can manually enable or
disable BT 6LoWPAN functionality between devices.
Eventually the connection is established automatically if
the devices are advertising suitable capability and this patch
can be removed.

Before connecting the devices do this

echo Y > /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/hci0/6lowpan

This enables 6LoWPAN support and creates the bt0 interface
automatically when devices are finally connected.

Rebooting or unloading the bluetooth kernel module will also clear the
settings from the kernel.
