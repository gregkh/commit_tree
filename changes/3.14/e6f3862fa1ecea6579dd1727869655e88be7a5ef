usb: gadget: FunctionFS: Remove VLAIS usage from gadget code

The use of variable length arrays in structs (VLAIS) in the Linux Kernel code
precludes the use of compilers which don't implement VLAIS (for instance the
Clang compiler). This alternate patch calculates offsets into the kmalloc-ed
memory buffer using macros. The previous patch required multiple kmalloc and
kfree calls. This version uses "group" vs "struct" since it really is not a
struct and is essentially a group of VLA in a common allocated block. This
version also fixes the issues pointed out by Andrzej Pietrasiewicz and
Michal Nazarewicz.
