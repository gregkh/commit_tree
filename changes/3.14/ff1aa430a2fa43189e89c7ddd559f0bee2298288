PCI/MSI: Add pci_msix_vec_count()

This creates an MSI-X counterpart for pci_msi_vec_count().  Device drivers
can use this function to obtain maximum number of MSI-X interrupts the
device supports and use that number in a subsequent call to
pci_enable_msix().

pci_msix_vec_count() supersedes pci_msix_table_size() and returns a
negative errno if device does not support MSI-X interrupts.  After this
update, callers must always check the returned value.

The only user of pci_msix_table_size() was the PCI-Express port driver,
which is also updated by this change.
