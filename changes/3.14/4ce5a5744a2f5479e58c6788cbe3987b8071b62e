IB/mlx4: Move rtnl locking to the right place

On the one hand, the invocation of netdev_master_upper_dev_get()
within mlx4_ib_scan_netdevs() must be done with rtnl lock held.  On
the other hand, it's wrong to call rtnl_lock() from within this
function since it's also called by our netdev notifier callback.
Therefore move the locking to mlx4_ib_add() so that both cases are
covered.
