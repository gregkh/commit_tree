sched/deadline: Add SCHED_DEADLINE inheritance logic

Some method to deal with rt-mutexes and make sched_dl interact with
the current PI-coded is needed, raising all but trivial issues, that
needs (according to us) to be solved with some restructuring of
the pi-code (i.e., going toward a proxy execution-ish implementation).

This is under development, in the meanwhile, as a temporary solution,
what this commits does is:

 - ensure a pi-lock owner with waiters is never throttled down. Instead,
   when it runs out of runtime, it immediately gets replenished and it's
   deadline is postponed;

 - the scheduling parameters (relative deadline and default runtime)
   used for that replenishments --during the whole period it holds the
   pi-lock-- are the ones of the waiting task with earliest deadline.

Acting this way, we provide some kind of boosting to the lock-owner,
still by using the existing (actually, slightly modified by the previous
commit) pi-architecture.

We would stress the fact that this is only a surely needed, all but
clean solution to the problem. In the end it's only a way to re-start
discussion within the community. So, as always, comments, ideas, rants,
etc.. are welcome! :-)
