block: Add bio_clone_fast()

bio_clone() just got more expensive - however, most users of bio_clone()
don't actually need to modify the biovec. If they aren't modifying the
biovec, and they can guarantee that the original bio isn't freed before
the clone (also true in most cases), we can just point the clone at the
original bio's biovec.
