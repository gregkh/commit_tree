rbd: enable extended devt in single-major mode

If single-major device number allocation scheme is turned on, instead
of reserving 256 minors per device, which imposes a limit of 4096
images mapped at once, reserve 16 minors per device and enable extended
devt feature.  This results in a theoretical limit of 65536 images
mapped at once, and still allows to have more than 15 partititions:
partitions starting with 16th are mapped under major 259 (Block
Extended Major):

$ rbd showmapped
id pool image snap device
0  rbd  b5    -    /dev/rbd0    # no partitions
1  rbd  b2    -    /dev/rbd1    # 40 partitions
2  rbd  b3    -    /dev/rbd2    #  2 partitions

$ cat /proc/partitions
 251        0       1024 rbd0
 251       16       1024 rbd1
 251       17          0 rbd1p1
 251       18          0 rbd1p2
 ...
 251       30          0 rbd1p14
 251       31          0 rbd1p15
 259        0          0 rbd1p16
 259        1          0 rbd1p17
 ...
 259       23          0 rbd1p39
 259       24          0 rbd1p40
 251       32       1024 rbd2
 251       33          0 rbd2p1
 251       34          0 rbd2p2

(major 251 was assigned dynamically at module load time)
