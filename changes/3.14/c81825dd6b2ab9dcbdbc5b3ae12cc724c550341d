audit: wait_for_auditd rework for readability

We had some craziness with signed to unsigned long casting which appears
wholely unnecessary.  Just use signed long.  Even though 2 values of the
math equation are unsigned longs the result is expected to be a signed
long.  So why keep casting the result to signed long?  Just make it
signed long and use it.

We also remove the needless "timeout" variable.  We already have the
stack "sleep_time" variable.  Just use that...
