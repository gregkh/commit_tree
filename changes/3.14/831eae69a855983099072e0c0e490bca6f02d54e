staging: dwc2: set up all module params

The DWC2 USB controller in the BCM2835 (Raspberry Pi) needs some non-
default parameters. Select these based on the compatible value from the
DT node. For all other HW, fall back to the default parameters currently
in use.

The values in params_bcm2835[] were posted to the mailing list by Paul
quite some time ago. I made a couple of minor modifications since then;
to set ahbcfg instead of ahb_single, and to set uframe_sched.
