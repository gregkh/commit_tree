xen/events: allow setup of irq_info to fail

The FIFO-based event ABI requires additional setup of newly bound
events (it may need to expand the event array) and this setup may
fail.

xen_irq_info_common_init() is a useful place to put this setup so
allow this call to fail.  This call and the other similar calls are
renamed to be *_setup() to reflect that they may now fail.

This failure can only occur with new event channels not on rebind.
