[media] vb2: push the mmap semaphore down to __buf_prepare()

Rather than taking the mmap semaphore at a relatively high-level function,
push it down to the place where it is really needed.

It was placed in vb2_queue_or_prepare_buf() to prevent racing with other
vb2 calls. The only way I can see that a race can happen is when two
threads queue the same buffer. The solution for that it to introduce
a PREPARING state.

Moving it down offers opportunities to simplify the code.
