firmware/dmi_scan: generalize for use by other archs

This patch makes a couple of changes to the SMBIOS/DMI scanning
code so it can be used on other archs (such as ARM and arm64):
(a) wrap the calls to ioremap()/iounmap(), this allows the use of a
    flavor of ioremap() more suitable for random unaligned access;
(b) allow the non-EFI fallback probe into hardcoded physical address
    0xF0000 to be disabled.
