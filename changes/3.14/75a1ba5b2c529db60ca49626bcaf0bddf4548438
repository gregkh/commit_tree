x86, microcode, AMD: Unify valid container checks

For additional coverage, BorisO and friends unknowlingly did swap AMD
microcode with Intel microcode blobs in order to see what happens. What
did happen on 32-bit was

[    5.722656] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at be3a6008
[    5.722693] IP: [<c106d6b4>] load_microcode_amd+0x24/0x3f0
[    5.722716] *pdpt = 0000000000000000 *pde = 0000000000000000

because there was a valid initrd there but without valid microcode in it
and the container check happened *after* the relocated ramdisk handling
on 32-bit, which was clearly wrong.

While at it, take care of the ramdisk relocation on both 32- and 64-bit
as it is done on both. Also, comment what we're doing because this code
is a bit tricky.
