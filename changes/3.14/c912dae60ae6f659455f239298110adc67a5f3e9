uprobes: Cleanup !CONFIG_UPROBES decls, unexport xol_area

1. Don't include asm/uprobes.h unconditionally, we only need
   it if CONFIG_UPROBES.

2. Move the definition of "struct xol_area" into uprobes.c.

   Perhaps we should simply kill struct uprobes_state, it buys
   nothing.

3. Kill the dummy definition of uprobe_get_swbp_addr(), nobody
   except handle_swbp() needs it.

4. Purely cosmetic, but move the decl of uprobe_get_swbp_addr()
   up, close to other __weak helpers.
