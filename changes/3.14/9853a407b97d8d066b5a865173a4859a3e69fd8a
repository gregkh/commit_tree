mm/rmap: use rmap_walk() in page_mkclean()

Now, we have an infrastructure in rmap_walk() to handle difference from
   variants of rmap traversing functions.

So, just use it in page_mkclean().

In this patch, I change following things.

1. remove some variants of rmap traversing functions.
    cf> page_mkclean_file
2. mechanical change to use rmap_walk() in page_mkclean().
