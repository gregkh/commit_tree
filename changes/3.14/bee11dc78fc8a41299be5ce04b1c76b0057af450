netfilter: nft_reject: support for IPv6 and TCP reset

This patch moves nft_reject_ipv4 to nft_reject and adds support
for IPv6 protocol. This patch uses functions included in nf_reject.h
to implement reject by TCP reset.

The code has to be build as a module if NF_TABLES_IPV6 is also a
module to avoid compilation error due to usage of IPv6 functions.
This has been done in Kconfig by using the construct:

 depends on NF_TABLES_IPV6 || !NF_TABLES_IPV6

This seems a bit weird in terms of syntax but works perfectly.
