rlt8192e: Removing unused defines in rltlib_endianfree.h

Checkpatch mentioned that these macros should be defined with a 'do {...} while(0)' statement.
So we used grep to find all files using these macros and we found out that these macros were only used
in rtl819x_Qos.h, in the defines we removed before.
Since the macros are not used anywhere else we decided to remove them from the driver.
