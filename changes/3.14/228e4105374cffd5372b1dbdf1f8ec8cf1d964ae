USB: pl2303: add line-status quirk for Siemens phones

Implement line-status handling for Siemens phones as a quirk rather than
spreading such information all over the driver by matching on vendor and
and product ids.

Note that the SIEMENS_PRODUCT_ID_EF81, which was added after the
line-status handling for the other Siemens phones was fixed, might also
need this quirk.
