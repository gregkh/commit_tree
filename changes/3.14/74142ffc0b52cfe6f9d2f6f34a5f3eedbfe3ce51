mfd: max77686: Fix regmap resource leak on driver remove

The regmap used by max77686 MFD driver was not freed with regmap_exit()
on driver exit. This lead to leak of resources.

Replace regmap_init_i2c() call in driver probe with initialization of
managed register map so the regmap will be properly freed by the device
management code.
