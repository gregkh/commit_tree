KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Remove bogus duplicate code

Commit 7b490411c37f ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add new state for
transactional memory") incorrectly added some duplicate code to the
guest exit path because I didn't manage to clean up after a rebase
correctly.  This removes the extraneous material.  The presence of
this extraneous code causes host crashes whenever a guest is run.
