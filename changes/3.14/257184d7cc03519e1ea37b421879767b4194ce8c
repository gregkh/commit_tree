phylib: Support attaching to generic 10g driver

phy_attach_direct() may now attach to a generic 10G driver. It can
also be used exactly as phy_connect_direct(), which will be useful
when using of_mdio, as phy_connect (and therefore of_phy_connect)
start the PHY state machine, which is currently irrelevant for 10G
PHYs.
