time: Revert to calling clock_was_set_delayed() while in irq context

In commit 47a1b796306356f35 ("tick/timekeeping: Call
update_wall_time outside the jiffies lock"), we moved to calling
clock_was_set() due to the fact that we were no longer holding
the timekeeping or jiffies lock.

However, there is still the problem that clock_was_set()
triggers an IPI, which cannot be done from the timer's hard irq
context, and will generate WARN_ON warnings.

Apparently in my earlier testing, I'm guessing I didn't bump the
dmesg log level, so I somehow missed the WARN_ONs.

Thus we need to revert back to calling clock_was_set_delayed().
