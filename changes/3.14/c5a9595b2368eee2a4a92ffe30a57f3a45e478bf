staging: comedi: dt2814: tidy up the irq support in dt2814_attach()

An irq is only needed by this driver in order to support async commands.
Since it is optional, modify the attach so that if the request_irq() fails
the attach does not fail.

Remove the printk noise about the irq.

Only hookup the async command support if the request_irq() was successful.
