kernfs: remove kernfs_addrm_cxt

kernfs_addrm_cxt and the accompanying kernfs_addrm_start/finish() were
added because there were operations which should be performed outside
kernfs_mutex after adding and removing kernfs_nodes.  The necessary
operations were recorded in kernfs_addrm_cxt and performed by
kernfs_addrm_finish(); however, after the recent changes which
relocated deactivation and unmapping so that they're performed
directly during removal, the only operation kernfs_addrm_finish()
performs is kernfs_put(), which can be moved inside the removal path
too.

This patch moves the kernfs_put() of the base ref to __kernfs_remove()
and remove kernfs_addrm_cxt and kernfs_addrm_start/finish().

* kernfs_add_one() is updated to grab and release the parent's active
  ref and kernfs_mutex itself.  kernfs_get/put_active() and
  kernfs_addrm_start/finish() invocations around it are removed from
  all users.

* __kernfs_remove() puts an unlinked node directly instead of chaining
  it to kernfs_addrm_cxt.  Its callers are updated to grab and release
  kernfs_mutex instead of calling kernfs_addrm_start/finish() around
  it.

v2: Updated to fit the v2 restructuring of removal path.
