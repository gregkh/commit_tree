usb: chipidea: put hw_phymode_configure before ci_usb_phy_init

hw_phymode_configure configures the PORTSC registers and allow the
following phy_inits to operate on the right parameters. This fix a problem
where the UPLI (ISP1504) could not be detected, because the Viewport was not
available and read the viewport return 0's only.
