powerpc/powernv: Move PHB-diag dump functions around

Prior to the completion of PCI enumeration, we actively detects
EEH errors on PCI config cycles and dump PHB diag-data if necessary.
The EEH backend also dumps PHB diag-data in case of frozen PE or
fenced PHB. However, we are using different functions to dump the
PHB diag-data for those 2 cases.

The patch merges the functions for dumping PHB diag-data to one so
that we can avoid duplicate code. Also, we never dump PHB3 diag-data
during PCI config cycles with frozen PE. The patch fixes it as well.
