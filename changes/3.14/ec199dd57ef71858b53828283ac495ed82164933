platform/chrome: chromeos_laptop - Restructure device associations

The previous code had a single DMI matching entry
for each device on a board. Instead provide a single
DMI entry for each board which references a structure
about each board that lists the associated peripherals.
This allows for a lower number of DMI matching sequences
as well making it easier to add new boards.
