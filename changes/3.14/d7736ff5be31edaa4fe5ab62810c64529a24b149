s390/dump: Fix dump memory detection

Dumps created by kdump or zfcpdump can contain invalid memory holes when
dumping z/VM systems that have memory pressure.

For example:

   # zgetdump -i /proc/vmcore.
   Memory map:
   0000000000000000 - 0000000000bfffff (12 MB)
   0000000000e00000 - 00000000014fffff (7 MB)
   000000000bd00000 - 00000000f3bfffff (3711 MB)

The memory detection function find_memory_chunks() issues tprot to
find valid memory chunks. In case of CMM it can happen that pages are
marked as unstable via set_page_unstable() in arch_free_page().
If z/VM has released that pages, tprot returns -EFAULT and indicates
a memory hole.

So fix this and switch off CMM in case of kdump or zfcpdump.
