sysfs, kernfs: move file core code to fs/kernfs/file.c

Move core file code to fs/kernfs/file.c.  fs/sysfs/file.c now contains
sysfs kernfs_ops callbacks, sysfs wrappers around kernfs interfaces,
and sysfs_schedule_callback().  The respective declarations in
fs/sysfs/sysfs.h are moved to fs/kernfs/kernfs-internal.h.

This is pure relocation.

v2: Refreshed on top of the v2 of "sysfs, kernfs: prepare read path
    for kernfs".

v3: Refreshed on top of the v3 of "sysfs, kernfs: prepare read path
    for kernfs".
