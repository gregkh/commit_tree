drm: Simplify the math in drm_calc_timestamping_constants()

drm_calc_timestamping_constants() makes the math more complex
than necessary.
- multipying the dotclock by 1000 is pointless, just makes all the
  numbers bigger
- div64_u64() is also pointless, div_u64 is enough
- pixeldur_ns doesn't need any 64bit math
