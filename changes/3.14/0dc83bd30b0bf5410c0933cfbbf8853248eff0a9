Revert "writeback: do not sync data dirtied after sync start"

This reverts commit c4a391b53a72d2df4ee97f96f78c1d5971b47489. Dave
Chinner <david@fromorbit.com> has reported the commit may cause some
inodes to be left out from sync(2). This is because we can call
redirty_tail() for some inode (which sets i_dirtied_when to current time)
after sync(2) has started or similarly requeue_inode() can set
i_dirtied_when to current time if writeback had to skip some pages. The
real problem is in the functions clobbering i_dirtied_when but fixing
that isn't trivial so revert is a safer choice for now.
