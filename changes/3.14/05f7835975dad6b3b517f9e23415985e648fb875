mtd: nand: don't use {read,write}_buf for 8-bit transfers

According to the Open NAND Flash Interface Specification (ONFI) Revision
3.1 "Parameters are always transferred on the lower 8-bits of the data
bus." for the Get Features and Set Features commands.

So using read_buf and write_buf is wrong for 16-bit wide nand chips as
they use I/O[15:0]. The Get Features command is easily fixed using 4
times the read_byte callback. For Set Features implement a new
overwritable callback "write_byte". Still I expect the default to work
just fine for all controllers and making it overwriteable was just done
for symmetry.
