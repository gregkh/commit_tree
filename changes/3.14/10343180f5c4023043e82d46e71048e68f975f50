dm persistent data: cleanup dm-thin specific references in text

DM's persistent-data library is now used my multiple targets so
exclusive references to "pool" or "thin provisioning" need to be
cleaned up.  Adjust Kconfig's DM_DEBUG_BLOCK_STACK_TRACING text
and remove "pool" from a block manager error message.
