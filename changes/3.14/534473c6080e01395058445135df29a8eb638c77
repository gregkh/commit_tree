netfilter: ctnetlink: honor CTA_MARK_MASK when setting ctmark

Useful to only set a particular range of the conntrack mark while
leaving exisiting parts of the value alone, e.g. when setting
conntrack marks via NFQUEUE.

Follows same scheme as MARK/CONNMARK targets, i.e. the mask defines
those bits that should be altered.  No mask is equal to '~0', ie.
the old value is replaced by new one.
