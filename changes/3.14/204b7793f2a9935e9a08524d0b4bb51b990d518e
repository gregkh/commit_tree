xhci: replace xhci_writel() with writel()

Function xhci_writel() is used to write a 32bit value in xHC registers residing
in MMIO address space. It takes as first argument a pointer to the xhci_hcd
although it does not use it. xhci_writel() internally simply calls writel().
This creates an illusion that xhci_writel() is an xhci specific function that
has to be called in a context where a pointer to xhci_hcd is available.

Remove xhci_writel() wrapper function and replace its calls with calls to
writel() to make the code more straight-forward.
