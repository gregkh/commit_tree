regmap: Fix 'ret' would return an uninitialized value

This patch give a warning when calling regmap_register_patch with
parameter num_regs <= 0.

When the num_regs parameter is zero and krealloc doesn't fail,
then the code would return an uninitialized value. However,
calling this function with num_regs == 0, would be a waste as it
essentially does nothing.
