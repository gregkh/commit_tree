arm64: kernel: restore HW breakpoint registers in cpu_suspend

When a CPU resumes from low-power, it restores HW breakpoint and
watchpoint slots through a CPU PM notifier. Since we want to enable
debugging as early as possible in the resume path, the mdscr content
is restored along the general purpose registers in the cpu_suspend API
and debug exceptions are reenabled when cpu_suspend returns. Since the
CPU PM notifier is run after a CPU has been resumed, we cannot expect
HW breakpoint registers to contain sane values till the notifier is run,
since the HW breakpoints registers content is unknown at reset; this means
that the CPU might run with debug exceptions enabled, mdscr restored but HW
breakpoint registers containing junk values that can trigger spurious
debug exceptions.

This patch fixes current HW breakpoints restore by moving the HW breakpoints
registers restoration to the cpu_suspend API, before the debug exceptions are
enabled. This way, as soon as the cpu_suspend function returns the
kernel can resume debugging with sane values in HW breakpoint registers.
