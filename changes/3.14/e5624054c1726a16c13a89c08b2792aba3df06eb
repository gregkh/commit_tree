mmc: sdio: add a quirk for broken SDIO_CCCR_INTx polling

Polling SDIO_CCCR_INTx could create a fake interrupt with Marvell
SD8797 card. Add a quirk to handle this case. The fixup here is
to issue a dummy CMD52 read to function 0 register 0xff, and this
dummy read must be right after SDIO_CCCR_INTx is read.

Patch has been verified on a dw_mmc controller (Samsung Chromebook)
with MMC_CAP_SDIO_IRQ disabled.
