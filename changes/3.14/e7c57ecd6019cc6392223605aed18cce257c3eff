ARM: imx6: Initialize low-power mode early again

Since commit 9e8147bb5ec5d1dda2141da70f96b98985a306cb
"ARM: imx6q: move low-power code out of clock driver"
the kernel fails to boot on i.MX6Q/D if preemption is
enabled (CONFIG_PREEMPT=y). The kernel just hangs
before the console comes up.

The above commit moved the initalization of the low-power
mode setting (enabling clocked WAIT states), which was
introduced in commit 83ae20981ae924c37d02a42c829155fc3851260c
"ARM: imx: correct low-power mode setting", from
imx6q_clks_init to imx6q_pm_init. Now it is called
much later, after all cores are enabled.

This patch moves the low-power mode initialization back
to imx6q_clks_init again (and to imx6sl_clks_init).
