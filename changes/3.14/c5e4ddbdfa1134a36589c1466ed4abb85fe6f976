net: stmmac: Add support for optional reset control

The DWMAC has a reset assert line, which is used on some SoCs. Add an
optional reset control to stmmac driver core.

To support reset control deferred probing, this patch changes the driver
probe function to return the actual error, instead of just -EINVAL.
