tracing: Add 'enable_event' and 'disable_event' event trigger commands

Add 'enable_event' and 'disable_event' event_command commands.

enable_event and disable_event event triggers are added by the user
via these commands in a similar way and using practically the same
syntax as the analagous 'enable_event' and 'disable_event' ftrace
function commands, but instead of writing to the set_ftrace_filter
file, the enable_event and disable_event triggers are written to the
per-event 'trigger' files:

    echo 'enable_event:system:event' > .../othersys/otherevent/trigger
    echo 'disable_event:system:event' > .../othersys/otherevent/trigger

The above commands will enable or disable the 'system:event' trace
events whenever the othersys:otherevent events are hit.

This also adds a 'count' version that limits the number of times the
command will be invoked:

    echo 'enable_event:system:event:N' > .../othersys/otherevent/trigger
    echo 'disable_event:system:event:N' > .../othersys/otherevent/trigger

Where N is the number of times the command will be invoked.

The above commands will will enable or disable the 'system:event'
trace events whenever the othersys:otherevent events are hit, but only
N times.

This also makes the find_event_file() helper function extern, since
it's useful to use from other places, such as the event triggers code,
so make it accessible.
