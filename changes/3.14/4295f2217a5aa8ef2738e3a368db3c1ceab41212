libceph: introduce and start using oid abstraction

In preparation for tiering support, which would require having two
(base and target) object names for each osd request and also copying
those names around, introduce struct ceph_object_id (oid) and a couple
helpers to facilitate those copies and encapsulate the fact that object
name is not necessarily a NUL-terminated string.
