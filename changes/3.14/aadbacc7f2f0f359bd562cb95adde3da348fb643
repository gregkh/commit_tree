staging/lustre/lnet: Fix use after free in ksocknal_send

Call to ksocknal_launch_packet might schedule a callback that
might free the just sent message, and so subsequent access to it
via lntmsg->msg_vmflush goes to freed memory.

Instead we'll just remember if we are in the vmflush thread and
only restore if we happened to set mempressure flag.
