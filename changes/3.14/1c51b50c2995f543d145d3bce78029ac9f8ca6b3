PCI/MSI: Export MSI mode using attributes, not kobjects

The PCI MSI sysfs code is a mess with kobjects for things that don't really
need to be kobjects.  This patch creates attributes dynamically for the MSI
interrupts instead of using kobjects.

Note, this removes a directory from sysfs.  Old MSI kobjects:

  pci_device
     └── msi_irqs
         └── 40
             └── mode

New MSI attributes:

  pci_device
     └── msi_irqs
         └── 40

As there was only one file "mode" with the kobject model, the interrupt
number is now a file that returns the "mode" of the interrupt (msi vs.
msix).
