pkt_sched: fq: more robust memory allocation

This patch brings NUMA support and automatic fallback to vmalloc()
in case kmalloc() failed to allocate FQ hash table.

NUMA support depends on XPS being setup for the device before
qdisc allocation. After a XPS change, it might be worth creating
qdisc hierarchy again.
