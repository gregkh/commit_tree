zram: fix race between reset and flushing pending work

Dan and Sergey reported that there is a racy between reset and flushing
of pending work so that it could make oops by freeing zram->meta in
reset while zram_slot_free can access zram->meta if new request is
adding during the race window.

This patch moves flush after taking init_lock so it prevents new request
so that it closes the race.
