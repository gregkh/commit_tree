usb: Add device quirk for Logitech HD Pro Webcams C920 and C930e

We've encountered a rare issue when enumerating two Logitech webcams
after a reboot that doesn't power cycle the USB ports. They are spewing
random data (possibly some leftover UVC buffers) on the second
(full-sized) Get Configuration request of the enumeration phase. Since
the data is random this can potentially cause all kinds of odd behavior,
and since it occasionally happens multiple times (after the kernel
issues another reset due to the garbled configuration descriptor), it is
not always recoverable. Set the USB_DELAY_INIT quirk that seems to work
around the issue.
