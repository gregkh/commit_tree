checkpatch: more comprehensive split strings warning

The current checkpatch test for split strings does not find several
cases that should be found.

For instance:

 		/* Else poor success; go back to mode in "active" table */
 		} else {
 			IWL_DEBUG_RATE(mvm,
-				       "LQ: GOING BACK TO THE OLD TABLE suc=%d cur-tpt=%d old-tpt=%d\n",
+				       "GOING BACK TO THE OLD TABLE: SR %d "
+				       "cur-tpt %d old-tpt %d\n",
 				       window->success_ratio,
 				       window->average_tpt,
 				      lq_sta->last_tpt);

does not currently emit a warning.

Improve the test to find these cases.

Add more exceptions to reduce false positives for assembly and octal/hex
string constants.
