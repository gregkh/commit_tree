ARM: OMAP2+: PRM: add support for initializing PRCM clock modules from DT

This patch provides top level functionality for the DT clock initialization.
Clock tree is initialized hierarchically starting from IP modules (CM/PRM/PRCM)
going down towards individual clock nodes, and finally initializing
clockdomains once all the clocks are ready.
