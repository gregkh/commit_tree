ceph: remove exported caps when handling cap import message

Version 3 cap import message includes the ID of the exported
caps. It allow us to remove the exported caps if we still haven't
received the corresponding cap export message.

We remove the exported caps because they are stale, keeping them
can compromise consistence.
