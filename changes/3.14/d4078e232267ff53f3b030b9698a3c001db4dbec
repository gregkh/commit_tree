x86, trace: Further robustify CR2 handling vs tracing

Building on commit 0ac09f9f8cd1 ("x86, trace: Fix CR2 corruption when
tracing page faults") this patch addresses another few issues:

 - Now that read_cr2() is lifted into trace_do_page_fault(), we should
   pass the address to trace_page_fault_entries() to avoid it
   re-reading a potentially changed cr2.

 - Put both trace_do_page_fault() and trace_page_fault_entries() under
   CONFIG_TRACING.

 - Mark both fault entry functions {,trace_}do_page_fault() as notrace
   to avoid getting __mcount or other function entry trace callbacks
   before we've observed CR2.

 - Mark __do_page_fault() as noinline to guarantee the function tracer
   does get to see the fault.
