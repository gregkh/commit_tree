GFS2: revert "GFS2: d_splice_alias() can't return error"

0d0d110720d7960b77c03c9f2597faaff4b484ae asserts that "d_splice_alias()
can't return error unless it was given an IS_ERR(inode)".

That was true of the implementation of d_splice_alias, but this is
really a problem with d_splice_alias: at a minimum it should be able to
return -ELOOP in the case where inserting the given dentry would cause a
directory loop.
