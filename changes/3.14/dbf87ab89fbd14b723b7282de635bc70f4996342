intel_idle: do C1E promotion disable quirk for hotplugged CPUs

If the system is booted with some CPUs offline C1E promotion disable quirk
won't be applied because on_each_cpu() in intel_idle_cpuidle_driver_init()
operates only on online CPUs. Fix it by adding the C1E promotion disable
handling to intel_idle_cpu_init() (which is also called during CPU_ONLINE
operation).
