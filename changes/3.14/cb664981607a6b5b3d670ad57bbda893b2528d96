mac80211: fix association to 20/40 MHz VHT networks

When a VHT network uses 20 or 40 MHz as per the HT operation
information, the channel center frequency segment 0 field in
the VHT operation information is reserved, so ignore it.

This fixes association with such networks when the AP puts 0
into the field, previously we'd disconnect due to an invalid
channel with the message
wlan0: AP VHT information is invalid, disable VHT
