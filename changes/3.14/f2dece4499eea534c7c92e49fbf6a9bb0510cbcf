usb: musb: correct use of schedule_delayed_work()

schedule_delayed_work() takes the delay in jiffies, not msecs. Fix the
caller sites in musb. This bug caused regressions with the cleanups
that went in for 3.14 (8ed1fb790ea: "usb: musb: finish suspend/reset
work independently from musb_hub_control()").
