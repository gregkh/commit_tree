gpu: ion: ion_chunk_heap: Zero chunk heap memory at creation time

Allocations from the ion heap need to be zeroed to protect userspace
from seeing memory belonging to other processes.  First allocations
from this heap were not zero'd allowing users to see memory from other
processes on a warm reset.
