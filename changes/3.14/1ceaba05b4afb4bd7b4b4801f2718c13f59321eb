ACPI / hotplug: Do not fail bus and device checks for disabled hotplug

If the scan handler for the given device has hotplug.enabled
unset, it doesn't really make sense to fail bus check and device
check notifications.

First, bus check may not have anything to do with the device it is
signaled for, but it may concern another device on the bus below
this one.  For this reason, bus check notifications should not be
failed if hotplug is disabled for the target device.

Second, device check notifications are signaled only after a device
has already appeared (or disappeared), so failing it can only prevent
scan handlers and drivers from attaching to that (already existing)
device, which is not very useful.

Consequently, if device hotplug is disabled through the device's
scan handler, fail eject request notifications only.
