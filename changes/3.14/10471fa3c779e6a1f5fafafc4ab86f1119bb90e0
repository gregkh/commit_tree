ARM i.MX5: set CAN peripheral clock to 24 MHz parent

This patch sets the parent of CAN peripheral clock (a.k.a. CPI clock) to the
lp_apm clock, which has a rate of 24 MHz.

In the CAN world a base clock with multiple of 8 MHz is suited best for all CIA
recommented bit rates. Without this patch the CAN peripheral clock on i.MX53
has a rate of 66.666 MHz which produces quite large bit rate errors.
