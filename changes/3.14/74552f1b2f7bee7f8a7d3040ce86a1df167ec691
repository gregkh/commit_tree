silicom: fix whitespace issues in bypass.c

This patch addresses several problems in bypass.c found by checkpatch.
Furthermore it removes/adds some empty lines to make the code more readable.

The following problems are fixed:
 - line over 80 characters
 - space after logical operator !
 - spaces instead of tabs
 - missing empty line after local declarations
 - empty line after {

The empty line issues were not discovered by checkpatch but in my opinion these
changes make perfect sense in terms of readability.
