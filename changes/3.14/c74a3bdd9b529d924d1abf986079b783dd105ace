ocfs2: add clustername to cluster connection

This is an effort of removing ocfs2_controld.pcmk and getting ocfs2 DLM
handling up to the times with respect to DLM (>=4.0.1) and corosync
(2.3.x).  AFAIK, cman also is being phased out for a unified corosync
cluster stack.

fs/dlm performs all the functions with respect to fencing and node
management and provides the API's to do so for ocfs2.  For all future
references, DLM stands for fs/dlm code.

The advantages are:
 + No need to run an additional userspace daemon (ocfs2_controld)
 + No controld device handling and controld protocol
 + Shifting responsibilities of node management to DLM layer

For backward compatibility, we are keeping the controld handling code.
Once enough time has passed we can remove a significant portion of the
code.  This was tested by using the kernel with changes on older
unmodified tools.  The kernel used ocfs2_controld as expected, and
displayed the appropriate warning message.

This feature requires modification in the userspace ocfs2-tools.  The
changes can be found at: https://github.com/goldwynr/ocfs2-tools branch:
nocontrold Currently, not many checks are present in the userspace code,
but that would change soon.
