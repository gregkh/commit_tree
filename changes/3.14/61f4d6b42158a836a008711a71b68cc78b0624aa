i2c: s3c2410: dont need CPU_FREQ transitions for exynos series

For Exynos4 and Exynos5 SoCs from Samsung the i2c clock is based
on a fixed 66 MHz peripheral clock, and therefore is completely
independent of the cpu frequency.
Thus, registering for a CPU freq notifier is very wasteful.

This patch modifes the code such that, i2c bus registers to
cpu_freq_transition only if CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_S3C24XX is enabled.

This change should save a bunch of cpufreq transitions calls
which does not apply to exynos SoCs.
