mm: numa: initialise numa balancing after jump label initialisation

The command line parsing takes place before jump labels are initialised
which generates a warning if numa_balancing= is specified and
CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL is set.

On older kernels before commit c4b2c0c5f647 ("static_key: WARN on usage
before jump_label_init was called") the kernel would have crashed.  This
patch enables automatic numa balancing later in the initialisation
process if numa_balancing= is specified.
