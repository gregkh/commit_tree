arm64: use generic strnlen_user and strncpy_from_user functions

This patch implements the word-at-a-time interface for arm64 using the
same algorithm as ARM. We use the fls64 macro, which expands to a clz
instruction via a compiler builtin. Big-endian configurations make use
of the implementation from asm-generic.

With this implemented, we can replace our byte-at-a-time strnlen_user
and strncpy_from_user functions with the optimised generic versions.
