PM / devfreq: Disable Exynos4 driver build on multiplatform

Exynos4 devfreq driver uses mach/map.h which is not available on
multiplatform. Hence disable build on multiplatform for now.
Without this patch we get the following build errors:
drivers/devfreq/exynos/exynos4_bus.h:15:22: fatal error: mach/map.h: No such file or directory
