Staging: keucr: Move the declaration of variable IsSSFDCCompliance in smilsub.c

This patch moves the declaration of variable IsSSFDCCompliance to file
smilsub.c since this is the only file which uses it. Hence, it also
removes extern declaration from the header file smil.h and unnecessary
declaration in smilmain.c
