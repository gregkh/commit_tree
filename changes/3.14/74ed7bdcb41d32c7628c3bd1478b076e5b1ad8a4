ARM: OMAP4460: cpuidle: Extend PM_OMAP4_ROM_SMP_BOOT_ERRATUM_GICD on cpuidle

The same workaround as ff999b8a0983ee15668394ed49e38d3568fc6859
"ARM: OMAP4460: Workaround for ROM bug because of CA9 r2pX GIC ..."
need to be applied not only when system is booting, but when MPUSS hits
OSWR state through CPUIdle too. Without this WA the same issue is
reproduced now on boards PandaES and Tablet/Blaze with SOM OMAP4460
when CONFIG_CPU_IDLE is enabled.
After MPUSS has enterred OSWR and waken up:
- GIC distributor became disabled forever
- scheduling is not performed any more
