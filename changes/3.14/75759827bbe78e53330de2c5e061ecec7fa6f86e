tools/liblockdep: Fix include of asm/hash.h

Commit 71ae8aac ("lib: introduce arch optimized hash library")
added an include to <linux/hash.h> for setting up an architecture
specific fast hash.

This patch mirrors the fix used for perf, titled "tools: perf: util: fix
include for non x86 architectures".
