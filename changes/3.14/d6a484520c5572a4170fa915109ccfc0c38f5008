parport: parport_pc: remove double PCI ID for NetMos

In commit 85747f ("PATCH] parport: add NetMOS 9805 support") Max added
the PCI ID for NetMOS 9805 based on a Debian bug report from 2k4 which
was at the v2.4.26 time frame. The patch made into 2.6.14.
Shortly before that patch akpm merged commit 296d3c783b ("[PATCH] Support
NetMOS based PCI cards providing serial and parallel ports") which made
into v2.6.9-rc1.
Now we have two different entries for the same PCI id.
I have here the NetMos 9805 which claims to support SPP/EPP/ECP mode.
This patch takes Max's entry for titan_1284p1 (base != -1 specifies the
ioport for ECP mode) and replaces akpm's entry for netmos_9805 which
specified -1 (=none). Both share the same PCI-ID (my card has subsystem
0x1000 / 0x0020 so it should match PCI_ANY).

While here I also drop the entry for titan_1284p2 which is the same as
netmos_9815.
