cpufreq: imx6q: correct VDDSOC/PU voltage scaling when cpufreq is changed

on i.MX6Q, cpu freq change need to follow below flows:

1. each setpoint has different VDDARM, VDDSOC/PU voltage, get the setpoint
   table from dts;
2. when cpu freq is scaling up, need to increase VDDSOC/PU voltage before
   VDDARM, if VDDPU is off, no need to change it;
3. when cpu freq is scaling down, need to decrease VDDARM voltage before
   VDDSOC/PU, if VDDPU is off, no need to change it;

normally dts will pass vddsoc/pu freq/volt info to kernel, if not, will
use fixed value for vddsoc/pu voltage setting.
