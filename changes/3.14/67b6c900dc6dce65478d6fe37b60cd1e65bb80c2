mm: slub: work around unneeded lockdep warning

The slub code does some setup during early boot in
early_kmem_cache_node_alloc() with some local data.  There is no
possible way that another CPU can see this data, so the slub code
doesn't unnecessarily lock it.  However, some new lockdep asserts
check to make sure that add_partial() _always_ has the list_lock
held.

Just add the locking, even though it is technically unnecessary.
