ixgbevf: redo dma mapping using the tx buffer info

This patch takes advantage of the dma buffer always being present in the
first descriptor and mapped as single. As such we can call dma_unmap_single
and don't need to check for DMA mapping in ixgbevf_clean_tx_irq().

In addition this patch makes use of the DMA API.
