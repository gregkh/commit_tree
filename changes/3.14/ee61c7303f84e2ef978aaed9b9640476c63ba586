drm: Don't reference objects in the flink name idr

There's no reason to keep a reference to objects in the name idr.  Each
handle to an object has a reference to the object and just before we
destroy the last handle we take the object out of the name idr.  Thus,
if an object is in the name idr, there's at least one reference to the
object.

Or to put it another way, the name idr reference will never keep the
object alive.  It just looks like it, which is confusing.
