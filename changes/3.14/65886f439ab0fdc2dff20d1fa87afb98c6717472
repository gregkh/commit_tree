ipmr: fix mfc notification flags

Commit 8cd3ac9f9b7b ("ipmr: advertise new mfc entries via rtnl") reuses the
function ipmr_fill_mroute() to notify mfc events.
But this function was used only for dump and thus was always setting the
flag NLM_F_MULTI, which is wrong in case of a single notification.

Libraries like libnl will wait forever for NLMSG_DONE.
