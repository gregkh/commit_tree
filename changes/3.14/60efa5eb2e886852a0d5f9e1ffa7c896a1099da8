Btrfs: use late_initcall instead of module_init

It seems that when init_btrfs_fs() is called, crc32c/crc32c-intel might
not always be already initialized, which results in the call to crypto_alloc_shash()
returning -ENOENT, as experienced by Ahmet who reported this.

Therefore make sure init_btrfs_fs() is called after crc32c is initialized (which
is at initialization level 6, module_init), by using late_initcall (which is at
initialization level 7) instead of module_init for btrfs.
