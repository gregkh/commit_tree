arm64: dcache: select DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS for little-endian CPUs

DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS uses the word-at-a-time API for optimised string
comparisons in the vfs layer.

This patch implements support for load_unaligned_zeropad in much the
same way as has been done for ARM, although big-endian systems are also
supported.
