cpufreq: cpufreq-cpu0: add dt node parsing for cooling device properties

This patch changes the cpufreq-cpu0 driver to consider if
a cpu needs cooling (with cpufreq). In case the cooling is needed,
the cpu0 device tree node needs to be properly configured
with cooling device properties.

In case these properties are present,, the driver will
load a cpufreq cooling device in the system. The cpufreq-cpu0
driver is not interested in determining how the system should
be using the cooling device. The driver is responsible
only of loading the cooling device.

Describing how the cooling device will be used can be
accomplished by setting up a thermal zone that references
and is composed by the cpufreq cooling device.
