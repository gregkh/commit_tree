bna: Firmware Patch Simplification

This patch includes change to enable firmware patch simplication feature.
This feature is targeted to address the requirement to have independent patch
release for firmware. Prior to the 3.2.3.0 firmware, releasing a patch fix for
firmware would require changes to bna driver, to use new firmware images.
However with these changes, if the new firmware is flashed on to the Adapter,
the driver will use the new firmware after checking the patch release byte in
the firmware version.

Update the f/w version to 3.2.3.0
