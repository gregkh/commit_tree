rtnetlink: remove check for fill_slave_info in rtnl_have_link_slave_info

This check is not needed because the same check is done before
fill_slave_info is used in rtnl_link_slave_info_fill.
Also, by removing this check, kernel will fillup IFLA_INFO_SLAVE_KIND
even for slaves of masters which does not implement fill_slave_info.
