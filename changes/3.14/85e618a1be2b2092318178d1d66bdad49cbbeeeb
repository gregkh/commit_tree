ARM: mvebu: Add quirk for i2c for the OpenBlocks AX3-4 board

The first variants of Armada XP SoCs (A0 stepping) have issues related
to the i2c controller which prevent to use the offload mechanism and
lead to a kernel hang during boot.

This commit add quirk in the mvebu platform code to check the SoC
version and then update the compatible string for the i2c controller
according to the revision of the SoC. Currently only some OpenBlocks
AX3-4 boards are known to use an A0 revision so the check is done only
for these boards.
