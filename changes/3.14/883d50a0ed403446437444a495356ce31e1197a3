arm64: simplify pgd_alloc

Currently pgd_alloc has a redundant NULL check in its return path that
can be removed with no ill effects. With that removed it's also possible
to return early and eliminate the new_pgd temporary variable.

This patch applies said modifications, making the logic of pgd_alloc
correspond 1-1 with that of pgd_free.
