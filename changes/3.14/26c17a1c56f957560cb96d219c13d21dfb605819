cm36651 have integration time from 1 to 640 milliseconds.
But, print more then the thousand second. when call *_integration_time attribute.
Because read_integration_time function return IIO_VAL_INT.
read integration time function is changed return IIO_VAL_INT_PLUS_MICRO;
And then .write_raw_get_fmt callback function for parse a fixed-point number from a string.
Some description is revised milliseconds unit.
