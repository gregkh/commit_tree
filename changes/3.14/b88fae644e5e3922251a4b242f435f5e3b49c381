exec: avoid propagating PF_NO_SETAFFINITY into userspace child

Userspace process doesn't want the PF_NO_SETAFFINITY, but its parent may be
a kernel worker thread which has PF_NO_SETAFFINITY set, and this worker thread
can do kernel_thread() to create the child.
Clearing this flag in usersapce child to enable its migrating capability.
