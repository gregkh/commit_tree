powerpc: kvm: optimize "sc 1" as fast return

In some scene, e.g openstack CI, PR guest can trigger "sc 1" frequently,
this patch optimizes the path by directly delivering BOOK3S_INTERRUPT_SYSCALL
to HV guest, so powernv can return to HV guest without heavy exit, i.e,
no need to swap TLB, HTAB,.. etc
