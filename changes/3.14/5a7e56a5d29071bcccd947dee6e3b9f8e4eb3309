cpufreq: Initialize policy before making it available for others to use

Policy must be fully initialized before it is being made available
for use by others. Otherwise cpufreq_cpu_get() would be able to grab
a half initialized policy structure that might not have affected_cpus
(for example) populated. Then, anybody accessing those fields will get
a wrong value and that will lead to unpredictable results.

In order to fix this, do all the necessary initialization before we
make the policy structure available via cpufreq_cpu_get(). That will
guarantee that any code accessing fields of the policy will get
correct data from them.
