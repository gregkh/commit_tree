[media] si4713: HID blacklist Si4713 USB development board

The Si4713 development board contains a Si4713 FM transmitter chip
and is handled by the radio-usb-si4713 driver.
The board reports itself as (10c4:8244) Cygnal Integrated Products, Inc.
and misidentifies itself as a HID device in its USB interface descriptor.
This patch ignores this device as an HID device and hence loads the custom driver.
