proc: cleanup/simplify get_task_state/task_state_array

get_task_state() and task_state_array[] look confusing and suboptimal, it
is not clear what it can actually report to user-space and
task_state_array[] blows .data for no reason.

1. state = (tsk->state & TASK_REPORT) | tsk->exit_state is not
   clear. TASK_REPORT is self-documenting but it is not clear
   what ->exit_state can add.

   Move the potential exit_state's (EXIT_ZOMBIE and EXIT_DEAD)
   into TASK_REPORT and use it to calculate the final result.

2. With the change above it is obvious that task_state_array[]
   has the unused entries just to make BUILD_BUG_ON() happy.

   Change this BUILD_BUG_ON() to use TASK_REPORT rather than
   TASK_STATE_MAX and shrink task_state_array[].

3. Turn the "while (state)" loop into fls(state).
