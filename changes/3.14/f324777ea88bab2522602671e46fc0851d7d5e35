[SCSI] qla2xxx: Fix multiqueue MSI-X registration.

This fixes requesting of the MSI-X vectors for the base response queue.
The iteration in the for loop in qla24xx_enable_msix() was incorrect.
We should only iterate of the first two MSI-X vectors and not the total
number of MSI-X vectors that have given to the driver for this device
from pci_enable_msix() in this function.
