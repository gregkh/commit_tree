ARM: add definitions for pte_mkexec/pte_mknexec

Other architectures define pte_mkexec to mark a pte as executable.
Add pte_mkexec for ARM to get the same functionality. Although no
other architectures currently define it, also add pte_mknexec to
explicitly allow a pte to be marked as non executable.
