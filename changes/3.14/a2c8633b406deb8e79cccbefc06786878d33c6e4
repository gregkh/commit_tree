ACPICA: Update ACPI example code to make it an actual working program.

Previously, the example code (tools/examples) showed the ACPICA
init code, but was not an actual working program. Added ACPI tables
to make it actually function.

Linux kernel behaviour is not affected as the change only applies
to the ACPICA userspace utilities which are not shipped in the
kernel currently.
