ARM: tegra: only run PL310 init on systems with one

Fix tegra_init_cache() to check whether the system has a PL310 cache
before touching the PL310 registers. This prevents access to non-existent
registers on Tegra114 and later.

Note for stable kernels:
In <= v3.12, the file to patch is arch/arm/mach-tegra/common.c.
