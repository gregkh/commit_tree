mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Add driver-specific ECC BCH support

This commit adds the BCH ECC support available in NFCv2 controller.
Depending on the detected required strength the respective ECC layout
is selected.

This commit adds an empty ECC layout, since support to access large
pages is first required. Once that support is added, a proper ECC
layout will be added as well.
