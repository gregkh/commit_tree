drm/i915: drop duplicate ggtt vma list add in setup_global_gtt

Preallocated objects will already have been added to the vma_list when
creating their ggtt vma entry, and coincidentally also marked as holding
a ggtt mapping. Repeating the vma_list manipulation when setting up the
ggtt after preallocation is a recipe for an unhappy kernel.
