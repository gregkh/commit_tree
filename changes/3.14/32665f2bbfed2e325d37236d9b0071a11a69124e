mm/migrate: correct failure handling if !hugepage_migration_support()

We should remove the page from the list if we fail with ENOSYS, since
migrate_pages() consider error cases except -ENOMEM and -EAGAIN as
permanent failure and it assumes that the page would be removed from the
list.  Without this patch, we could overcount number of failure.

In addition, we should put back the new hugepage if
!hugepage_migration_support().  If not, we would leak hugepage memory.
