net: Allow setting sock flow hash without a sock

This patch adds sock_rps_record_flow_hash and sock_rps_reset_flow_hash
which take a hash value as an argument and sets the sock_flow_table
accordingly.  This allows the table to be populated in cases where flow
is being tracked outside of a sock structure.

sock_rps_record_flow and sock_rps_reset_flow call this function
where the hash is taken from sk_rxhash.
