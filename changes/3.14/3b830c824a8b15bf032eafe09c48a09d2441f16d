powerpc/relocate fix relocate processing in LE mode

Relocation's code is not working in little endian mode because the r_info
field, which is a 64 bits value, should be read from the right offset.

The current code is optimized to read the r_info field as a 32 bits value
starting at the middle of the double word (offset 12). When running in LE
mode, the read value is not correct since only the MSB is read.

This patch removes this optimization which consist to deal with a 32 bits
value instead of a 64 bits one. This way it works in big and little endian
mode.
