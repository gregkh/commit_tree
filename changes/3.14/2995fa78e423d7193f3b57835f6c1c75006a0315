dm sysfs: fix a module unload race

This reverts commit be35f48610 ("dm: wait until embedded kobject is
released before destroying a device") and provides an improved fix.

The kobject release code that calls the completion must be placed in a
non-module file, otherwise there is a module unload race (if the process
calling dm_kobject_release is preempted and the DM module unloaded after
the completion is triggered, but before dm_kobject_release returns).

To fix this race, this patch moves the completion code to dm-builtin.c
which is always compiled directly into the kernel if BLK_DEV_DM is
selected.

The patch introduces a new dm_kobject_holder structure, its purpose is
to keep the completion and kobject in one place, so that it can be
accessed from non-module code without the need to export the layout of
struct mapped_device to that code.
