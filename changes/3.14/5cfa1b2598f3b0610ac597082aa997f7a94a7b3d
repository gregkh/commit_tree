staging: rtl8187se: fix coding style in function declarations

Removed innecessary spaces and indentation errors in function definition
(including some curly braces wrongly placed and broke up at 80-chars per line).

I still see some errors if I run the checkpatch.pl script, but those are not
my fault. I'll address them in follow up patches.
