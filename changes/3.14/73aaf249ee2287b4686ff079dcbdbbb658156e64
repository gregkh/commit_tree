KVM: SVM: Fix reading of DR6

In contrast to VMX, SVM dose not automatically transfer DR6 into the
VCPU's arch.dr6. So if we face a DR6 read, we must consult a new vendor
hook to obtain the current value. And as SVM now picks the DR6 state
from its VMCB, we also need a set callback in order to write updates of
DR6 back.

Fixes a regression of 020df0794f.
