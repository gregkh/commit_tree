rtnetlink: provide api for getting and setting slave info

Recent patch
bonding: add netlink attributes to slave link dev (1d3ee88ae0d6)

Introduced yet another device specific way to access slave information
over rtnetlink. There is one already there for bridge.

This patch introduces generic way to do this, for getting and setting
info as well by extending link_ops. Later on, this new interface will
be used for bridge ports as well.
