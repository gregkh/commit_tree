ARM: mvebu: dts: remove unneeded linux,default-state from led nodes

Generally, power LEDs should indicate when power is applied, and go out
once power is removed.  _Not_ annoy the developer with migraine-inducing
blinking reminicent of some badly animated television series designed to
sell sugar to children.

On a more serious note, most of these OS-specific properties aren't
necessary and should be removed.  I left two that are legitimately tying
disk LEDs to disk activity.  Other than that, we keep the state the
bootloader left them in until userspace changes the state via sysfs.
