[media] v4l: atmel-isi: Should clear bits before set the hardware register

In the ISI driver it reads the config register to get original value,
then set the correct FRATE_DIV and YCC_SWAP_MODE directly. This will
cause some bits overlap.

So we need to clear these bits first, then set correct value. This patch
fix it.
