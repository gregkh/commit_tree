ARM: tegra: use section-sized static mappings for LPAE too

The static mappings for Tegra's PPSB and APB regions were sized at 1MB
in order to allow mapping via sections in order to avoid burning RAM for
PTEs. On LPAE, sections are 2MB, so the static mappings need to be
larger in order to gain the same benefit. Set IO_{PPSB,APB}_SIZE to
SECTION_SIZE so this adjusts automatically.

While we're fiddling with iomap.h, compress IO_{IRAM,CPU}_VIRT together
to save virtual address space in the vmalloc region; these two regions
are mapped using PTEs.
