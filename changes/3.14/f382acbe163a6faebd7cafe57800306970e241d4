ASoC: ux500: Store DMA data in the DAI differently in the pdata and DT case

In this patch we do two things. Firstly, instead of open coding the
store of DMA data in to the DAI for later use, we use the API provided.
Secondly we create and store similar DMA data for the DT case, only
this time we use 'struct snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data' which is provided
by the core for this very reason.
