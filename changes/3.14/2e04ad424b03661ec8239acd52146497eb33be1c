sch_tbf: add TBF_BURST/TBF_PBURST attribute

When we set burst to 1514 with low rate in userspace,
the kernel get a value of burst that less than 1514,
which doesn't work.

Because it may make some loss when transform burst
to buffer in userspace. This makes burst lose some
bytes, when the kernel transform the buffer back to
burst.

This patch adds two new attributes to support sending
burst/mtu to kernel directly to avoid the loss.
