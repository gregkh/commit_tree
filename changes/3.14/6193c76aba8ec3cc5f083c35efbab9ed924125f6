rcu: Kick CPU halfway to RCU CPU stall warning

When an RCU CPU stall warning occurs, the CPU invokes resched_cpu() on
itself.  This can help move the grace period forward in some situations,
but it would be even better to do this -before- the RCU CPU stall warning.
This commit therefore causes resched_cpu() to be called every five jiffies
once the system is halfway to an RCU CPU stall warning.
