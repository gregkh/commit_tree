xen/pvh: set CR4 flags for APs

During bootup in the 'probe_page_size_mask' these CR4 flags are
set in there. But for AP processors they are not set as we do not
use 'secondary_startup_64' which the baremetal kernels uses.
Instead do it in this function which we use in Xen PVH during our
startup for AP processors.

As such fix it up to make sure we have that flag set.
