ARM: ux500: disable msp2 device tree node

Commit 70b41abc151f9
"ARM: ux500: move MSP pin control to the device tree"
accidentally activated MSP2, giving rise to a boot scroll
scream as the kernel attempts to probe a driver for it and
fails to obtain DMA channel 14.

Fix this up by marking the node disabled again.
