tpm: Move sysfs functions from tpm-interface to tpm-sysfs

CLASS-sysfs.c is a common idiom for linux subsystems.

This is the first step to pulling all the sysfs support code from
the drivers into tpm-sysfs. This is a plain text copy from tpm-interface
with support changes to make it compile.

_tpm_pcr_read is made non-static and is called tpm_pcr_read_dev.
