fs: Add prototype declaration to appropriate header file include/linux/bio.h

Add prototype declaration to header file include/linux/bio.h because it
is used by more than one file.

This eliminates the following warning in bio-integrity.c:
fs/bio-integrity.c:214:14: warning: no previous prototype for ‘bio_integrity_tag_size’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
