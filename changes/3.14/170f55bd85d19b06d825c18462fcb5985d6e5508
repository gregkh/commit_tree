[media] s5p-jpeg: Remove superfluous call to the jpeg_bound_align_image function

Aligning capture queue image dimensions while enqueuing output
queue doesn't make a sense as the S_FMT ioctl might have not
been called for the capture queue until that moment, whereas
it is required to know capture format as the type of alignment
heavily depends on it.
