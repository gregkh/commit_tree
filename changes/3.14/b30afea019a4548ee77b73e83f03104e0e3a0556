include/linux/genalloc.h: spinlock_t needs spinlock_types.h

Compiling a C file which includes genalloc.h but without
spinlock_types.h being included before, we will see the compile error
below.

 include/linux/genalloc.h:54:2: error: unknown type name `spinlock_t'

Include spinlock_types.h from genalloc.h to fix the problem.
