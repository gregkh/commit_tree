fanotify: Handle overflow in case of permission events

If the event queue overflows when we are handling permission event, we
will never get response from userspace. So we must avoid waiting for it.
Change fsnotify_add_notify_event() to return whether overflow has
happened so that we can detect it in fanotify_handle_event() and act
accordingly.
