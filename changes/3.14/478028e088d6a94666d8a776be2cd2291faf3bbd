ASoC: generic-dmaengine-pcm: Check DMA residue granularity

The dmaengine framework now exposes the granularity with which it is able to
report the transfer residue for a certain DMA channel. Check the granularity in
the generic dmaengine PCM driver and
	a) Set the SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH if the granularity is per period or worse.
	b) Fallback to the (race condition prone) period counting if the driver does
	not support any residue reporting.
