l2tp: fix manual sequencing (de)activation in L2TPv2

Commit e0d4435f "l2tp: Update PPP-over-L2TP driver to work over L2TPv3"
broke the PPPOL2TP_SO_SENDSEQ setsockopt. The L2TP header length was
previously computed by pppol2tp_l2t_header_len() before each call to
l2tp_xmit_skb(). Now that header length is retrieved from the hdr_len
session field, this field must be updated every time the L2TP header
format is modified, or l2tp_xmit_skb() won't push the right amount of
data for the L2TP header.

This patch uses l2tp_session_set_header_len() to adjust hdr_len every
time sequencing is (de)activated from userspace (either by the
PPPOL2TP_SO_SENDSEQ setsockopt or the L2TP_ATTR_SEND_SEQ netlink
attribute).
