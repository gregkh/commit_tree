ceph: Fix up after semantic merge conflict

The previous ceph-client merge resulted in ceph not even building,
because there was a merge conflict that wasn't visible as an actual data
conflict: commit 7221fe4c2ed7 ("ceph: add acl for cephfs") added support
for POSIX ACL's into Ceph, but unluckily we also had the VFS tree change
a lot of the POSIX ACL helper functions to be much more helpful to
filesystems (see for example commits 2aeccbe957d0 "fs: add generic
xattr_acl handlers", 5bf3258fd2ac "fs: make posix_acl_chmod more useful"
and 37bc15392a23 "fs: make posix_acl_create more useful")

The reason this conflict wasn't obvious was many-fold: because it was a
semantic conflict rather than a data conflict, it wasn't visible in the
git merge as a conflict.  And because the VFS tree hadn't been in
linux-next, people hadn't become aware of it that way.  And because I
was at jury duty this morning, I was using my laptop and as a result not
doing constant "allmodconfig" builds.

Anyway, this fixes the build and generally removes a fair chunk of the
Ceph POSIX ACL support code, since the improved helpers seem to match
really well for Ceph too.  But I don't actually have any way to *test*
the end result, and I was really hoping for some ACK's for this.  Oh,
well.

Not compiling certainly doesn't make things easier to test, so I'm
committing this without the acks after having waited for four hours...
Plus it's what I would have done for the merge had I noticed the
semantic conflict..
