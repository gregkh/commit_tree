m68k/atari: Call paging_init() before nf_init()

nf_init() uses virt_to_phys(), which depends on m68k_memoffset being set and
module_fixup() having been called, but this is only done in paging_init().
Hence call paging_init() before nf_init().

This went unnoticed, as virt_to_phys() is a no-op on Atari, unless you start
fiddling with the memory blocks in the bootinfo manually.
