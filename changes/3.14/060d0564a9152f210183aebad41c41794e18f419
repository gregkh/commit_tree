o __qlcnic_down call's netif_tx_disable which in turn stops
  all the TX queues, corresponding start queue was missing in
  __qlcnic_up which was leading to tx timeout.
o The commit b84caae486135d588fb200973b0be8cb8a511edf
  (qlcnic: Fix usage of netif_tx_{wake, stop} api during link change.)
  exposed this issue.
