drivers: phy: Add support for optional phys

Add devm_phy_optional_get and phy_optional_get, which should be used
when the phy is optional. They does not return an error when the phy
does not exist, rather they returns NULL, which is considered as a valid
phy, but results in NOPs when used with the consumer API.
