ipv4: fix a dst leak in tunnels

This patch :

1) Remove a dst leak if DST_NOCACHE was set on dst
   Fix this by holding a reference only if dst really cached.

2) Remove a lockdep warning in __tunnel_dst_set()
    This was reported by Cong Wang.

3) Remove usage of a spinlock where xchg() is enough

4) Remove some spurious inline keywords.
   Let compiler decide for us.
