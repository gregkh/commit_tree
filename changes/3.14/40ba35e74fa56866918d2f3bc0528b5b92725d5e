net: mvneta: add missing bit descriptions for interrupt masks and causes

Marvell has not published the chip's datasheet yet, so it's very hard
to find the relevant bits to manipulate to change the IRQ behaviour.
Fortunately, these bits are described in the proprietary LSP patch set
which is publicly available here :

So let's put them back in the driver in order to reduce the burden of
current and future maintenance.
