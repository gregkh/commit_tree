fs/read_write.c:compat_readv(): remove bogus area verify

The compat_do_readv_writev() function was doing a verify_area on the
incoming iov, but the nr_segs value is not checked.  If someone passes
in a -1 for nr_segs, for instance, the function should return an EINVAL.
However, it returns a EFAULT because the verify_area fails because it is
checking an array of size MAX_UINT.  The check is bogus, anyway, because
the next check, compat_rw_copy_check_uvector(), will do all the
necessary checking, anyway.  The non-compat do_readv_writev() function
doesn't do this check, so I think it's safe to just remove the code.
