blk-mq: fix initializing request's start time

blk_rq_init() is called in req's complete handler to initialize
the request, so the members of start_time and start_time_ns might
become inaccurate when it is allocated in future.

The patch initializes the two members in blk_mq_rq_ctx_init() to
fix the problem.
