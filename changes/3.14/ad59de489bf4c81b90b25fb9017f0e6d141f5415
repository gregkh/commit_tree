mfd: wolfson: Constify struct mfd_cell where possible

As of commit 03e361b25ee8dfb1fd9b890072c23c4aae01c6c7 ("mfd: Stop setting
refcounting pointers in original mfd_cell arrays"), the "cell" parameter of
mfd_add_devices() is "const" again. Hence make all cell data passed to
mfd_add_devices() const where possible.
