drivers: gpu: Include appropriate header file in r128_ioc32.c

Include appropriate header file drm/r128/r128_drv.h in
drm/r128/r128_ioc32.c because function r128_compat_ioctl() has its
prototype declaration in the header file.

This eliminates the following warning in drm/r128/r128_ioc32.c:
drivers/gpu/drm/r128/r128_ioc32.c:196:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘r128_compat_ioctl’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
