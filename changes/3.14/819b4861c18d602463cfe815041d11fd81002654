CLK: ti: add init support for clock IP blocks

ti_dt_clk_init_provider() can now be used to initialize the contents of
a single clock IP block. This parses all the clocks under the IP block
and calls the corresponding init function for them.

This patch also introduces a helper function for the TI clock drivers
to get register info from DT and append the master IP info to this.
