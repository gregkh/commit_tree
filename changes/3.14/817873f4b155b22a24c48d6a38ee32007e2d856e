ASoC: pcm: Properly initialize hw->rate_max

If none of the components (CODEC or CPU DAI) sets a maximum sample rate we'll
end up with the rate_max field of the runtime hardware set to 0.  (Note that it
is still possible for the components to constrain the supported sample rates
using other methods, e.g. setting a list constraint) If rate_max is 0 this means
that the sound card doesn't support any rates at all, which is not the desired
result. So initialize rate_max to UINT_MAX. For symmetry reasons also set
rate_min to 0.
