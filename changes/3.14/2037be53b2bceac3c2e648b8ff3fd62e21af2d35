perf sort: Compare addresses if no symbol info

If a hist entry doesn't have symbol information, compare it with its
address.  Currently it only compares its level or whether it's NULL.

This can lead to an undesired result like an overhead exceeds 100%
especially when callchain accumulation is enabled by later patch.
