ALSA: hda - Add parameter for dumping processing coefficients

Processing coefficients are often a vital part of the codec's configuration,
so dumping them can be important. However, because they are undocumented and
secret, we do not want to enable this for all codecs by default.

Therefore instead add this as a debugging parameter.

I have prepared for codecs that want to enable this by default by the extra
dump_coef bitfield, but unsure if we want to do that as long as the
(unlikely, but still) race remains.
