mac80211: optimise synchronize_net() for sta_info_flush

There's no reason to have one synchronize_net() for each
removed station, refactor the code slightly to have just
a single synchronize_net() for all stations.

Note that this is currently useless as hostapd removes
stations one by one and this coalescing never happens.
