SUNRPC/NFSD: Support a new option for ignoring the result of svc_register

NFSv4 clients can contact port 2049 directly instead of needing the
portmapper.

Therefore a failure to register to the portmapper when starting an
NFSv4-only server isn't really a problem.

But Gareth Williams reports that an attempt to start an NFSv4-only
server without starting portmap fails:

  #rpc.nfsd -N 2 -N 3
  rpc.nfsd: writing fd to kernel failed: errno 111 (Connection refused)
  rpc.nfsd: unable to set any sockets for nfsd

Add a flag to svc_version to tell the rpc layer it can safely ignore an
rpcbind failure in the NFSv4-only case.
