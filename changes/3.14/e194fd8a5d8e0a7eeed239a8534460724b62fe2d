staging: binder: Fix death notifications

The change (008fa749e0fe5b2fffd20b7fe4891bb80d072c6a) that moved the
node release code to a separate function broke death notifications in
some cases. When it encountered a reference without a death
notification request, it would skip looking at the remaining
references, and therefore fail to send death notifications for them.
