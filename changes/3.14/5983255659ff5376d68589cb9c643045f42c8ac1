Documentation: devicetree: Update Exynos MCT bindings description

This patch updates description of device tree bindings for Exynos MCT
(multicore timers). Namely:
 - added note about simplified specification of local timer interrupts,
   when using single per-processor interrupt for all local timers,
 - changed first example that was incorrectly suggesting that global
   timer interrupts are optional,
 - simplified example interrupt map,
 - added example showing simplified local timer interrupt specification.
