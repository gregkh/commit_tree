xfs: simplify xfs_setsize_buftarg callchain; remove unused arg

The "verbose" argument to xfs_setsize_buftarg_flags() has been
unused since:

ffe37436 xfs: stop using the page cache to back the buffer cache

Remove it, and fold the function into xfs_setsize_buftarg()
now that there's no need for different types of callers.

Fix inconsistent comment spacing while we're at it.
