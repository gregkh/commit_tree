Bluetooth: Always wait for a connection on RFCOMM open()

This patch fixes two regressions introduced with the recent rfcomm tty
rework.

The current code uses the carrier_raised() method to wait for the
bluetooth connection when a process opens the tty.

However processes may open the port with the O_NONBLOCK flag or set the
CLOCAL termios flag: in these cases the open() syscall returns
immediately without waiting for the bluetooth connection to
complete.

This behaviour confuses userspace which expects an established bluetooth
connection.

The patch restores the old behaviour by waiting for the connection in
rfcomm_dev_activate() and removes carrier_raised() from the tty_port ops.

As a side effect the new code also fixes the case in which the rfcomm
tty device is created with the flag RFCOMM_REUSE_DLC: the old code
didn't call device_move() and ModemManager skipped the detection
probe. Now device_move() is always called inside rfcomm_dev_activate().
