rbd: tweak "loaded" message and module description

Tweak "loaded" message, so that it looks like

[   30.184235] rbd: loaded

instead of

[   38.056564] rbd: loaded rbd (rados block device)

Also move (and slightly tweak) MODULE_DESCRIPTION so that all authors
are next to each other in modinfo output.
