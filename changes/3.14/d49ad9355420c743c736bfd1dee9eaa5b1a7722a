mm, oom: prefer thread group leaders for display purposes

When two threads have the same badness score, it's preferable to kill
the thread group leader so that the actual process name is printed to
the kernel log rather than the thread group name which may be shared
amongst several processes.

This was the behavior when select_bad_process() used to do
for_each_process(), but it now iterates threads instead and leads to
ambiguity.
