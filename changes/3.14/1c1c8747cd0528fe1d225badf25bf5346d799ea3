btrfs: sanitize BTRFS_IOC_FILE_EXTENT_SAME

* don't assume that ->dest_count won't change between copy_from_user()
and memdup_user()
* use fdget instead of fget
* don't bother comparing superblocks when we'd already compared vfsmounts
* get rid of excessive goto
* use file_inode() instead of open-coding the sucker
