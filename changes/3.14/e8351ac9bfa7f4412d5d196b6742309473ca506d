mm/rmap: use rmap_walk() in try_to_munlock()

Now, we have an infrastructure in rmap_walk() to handle difference from
variants of rmap traversing functions.

So, just use it in try_to_munlock().

In this patch, I change following things.

1. remove some variants of rmap traversing functions.
	cf> try_to_unmap_ksm, try_to_unmap_anon, try_to_unmap_file
2. mechanical change to use rmap_walk() in try_to_munlock().
3. copy and paste comments.
