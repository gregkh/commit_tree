x86/mm/pageattr: Add a PGD pagetable populating function

This allocates, if necessary, and populates the corresponding PGD entry
with a PUD page. The next population level is a dummy macro which will
be removed by the next patch and it is added here to keep the patch
small and easily reviewable but not break bisection, at the same time.
