crush: return CRUSH_ITEM_UNDEF for failed placements with indep

For firstn mode, if we fail to make a valid placement choice, we just
continue and return a short result to the caller.  For indep mode, however,
we need to make the position stable, and return an undefined value on
failed placements to avoid shifting later results to the left.

Reflects ceph.git commit b1d4dd4eb044875874a1d01c01c7d766db5d0a80.
