[media] adv7842: set LLC DLL phase from platform_data

The correct LLC DLL phase depends on the board layout, so this
should be part of the platform_data.

Also updated the platform_data in ezkit to ensure that what was the old
default value is now explicitly specified, so the behavior for that board
is unchanged.
