mac80211: minstrel_ht: replace some occurences of MCS_GROUP_RATES

Consecutive MCSes in [8*(NSS-1)->8*NSS[ have the same number NSS of
streams (except for MCS32 which is mishandled ATM).
ATM minstrel_ht uses MCS_GROUP_RATES in place of this 8 modulus.
This change replaces such occurences and by doing so allows for different
values of MCS_GROUP_RATES (e.g to cope with VHT MCS8,9).
