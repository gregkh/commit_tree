x86, asmlinkage, paravirt: Don't rely on local assembler labels

The paravirt patching code assumes that it can reference a
local assembler label between two different top level assembler
statements. This does not work with LTO
where the assembler code may end up in different assembler files.

Replace it with extern / global /asm linkage labels.

This also removes one redundant copy of the macro.
