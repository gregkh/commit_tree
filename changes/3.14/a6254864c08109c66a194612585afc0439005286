ipv4: fix counter in_slow_tot

since commit 89aef8921bf("ipv4: Delete routing cache."), the counter
in_slow_tot can't work correctly.

The counter in_slow_tot increase by one when fib_lookup() return successfully
in ip_route_input_slow(), but actually the dst struct maybe not be created and
cached, so we can increase in_slow_tot after the dst struct is created.
