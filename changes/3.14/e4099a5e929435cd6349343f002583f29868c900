sched/deadline: Fix up the smp-affinity mask tests

For now deadline tasks are not allowed to set smp affinity; however
the current tests are wrong, cure this.

The test in __sched_setscheduler() also uses an on-stack cpumask_t
which is a no-no.

Change both tests to use cpumask_subset() such that we test the root
domain span to be a subset of the cpus_allowed mask. This way we're
sure the tasks can always run on all CPUs they can be balanced over,
and have no effective affinity constraints.
