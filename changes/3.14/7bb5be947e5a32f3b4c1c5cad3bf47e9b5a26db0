watchdog: hpwdt patch to display informative string

This patch is being submitted to output a general string when the panic comes
in that informs the user of the possible places to look for the source of the
NMI. Because various systems log the message in different places this would
give a single display of where to go look instead of code that acts on all
these different server names or IDs.
