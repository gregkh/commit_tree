x86, kaslr: Return location from decompress_kernel

This allows decompress_kernel to return a new location for the kernel to
be relocated to. Additionally, enforces CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START as the
minimum relocation position when building with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE.

With CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE set, the choose_kernel_location routine
will select a new location to decompress the kernel, though here it is
presently a no-op. The kernel command line option "nokaslr" is introduced
to bypass these routines.
