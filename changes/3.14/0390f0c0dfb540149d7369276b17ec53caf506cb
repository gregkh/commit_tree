[SCSI] hpsa: cap CCISS_PASSTHRU at 20 concurrent commands.

Cap CCISS_BIG_PASSTHRU as well.  If an attempt is made
to exceed this, ioctl() will return -1 with errno == EAGAIN.

This is to prevent a userland program from exhausting all of
pci_alloc_consistent memory.  I've only seen this problem when
running a special test program designed to provoke it.  20
concurrent commands via the passthru ioctls (not counting SG_IO)
should be more than enough.
