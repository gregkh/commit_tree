usb:hub set hub->change_bits when over-current happens

When we are doing compliance test with xHCI, we found that if we
enable CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND and plug in a bad device which causes
over-current condition to the root port, software will not be noticed.
The reason is that current code don't set hub->change_bits in
hub_activate() when over-current happens, and then hub_events() will
not check the port status because it thinks nothing changed.
If CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND is disabled, the interrupt pipe of the hub will
report the change and set hub->event_bits, and then hub_events() will
check what events happened.In this case over-current can be detected.
