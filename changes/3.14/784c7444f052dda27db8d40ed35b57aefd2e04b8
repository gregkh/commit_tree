ARM: tegra: add MMC controllers to Tegra124 DT

Tegra124 has 4 MMC controllers just like previous versions of the SoC.
Note that there are some non-backwards-compatible HW differences, and
hence a new DT compatible value must be used to describe the HW.

Also enable the relevant controllers in the Venice2 board DT.
