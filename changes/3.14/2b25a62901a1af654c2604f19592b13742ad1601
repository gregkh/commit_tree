sysfs, kernfs: reorganize SYSFS_* constants

We want to add one more SYSFS_FLAG_* but we can't use the next higher
bit, 0x10000, as the flag field is 16bits wide.  The flags are
currently arranged weirdly - 8 bits are set aside for the type flags
when there are only three three used, the first flag starts at 0x1000
instead of 0x0100 and flag literals have 5 digits (20 bits) when only
4 digits can be used.

Rearrange them so that type bits are only the lowest four, flags start
at 0x0010 and similar flags are grouped.

This patch doesn't cause any behavior difference.
