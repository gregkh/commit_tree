virtio-net: drop rq->max and rq->num

It looks like there's no need for those two fields:

- Unless there's a failure for the first refill try, rq->max should be always
  equal to the vring size.
- rq->num is only used to determine the condition that we need to do the refill,
  we could check vq->num_free instead.
- rq->num was required to be increased or decreased explicitly after each
  get/put which results a bad API.

So this patch removes them both to make the code simpler.
