genirq: Add missing irq_to_desc export for CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ=n

In allmodconfig builds for sparc and any other arch which does
not set CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ, the following will be seen at modpost:

  CC [M]  lib/cpu-notifier-error-inject.o
  CC [M]  lib/pm-notifier-error-inject.o
ERROR: "irq_to_desc" [drivers/gpio/gpio-mcp23s08.ko] undefined!
make[2]: *** [__modpost] Error 1

This happens because commit 3911ff30f5 ("genirq: export
handle_edge_irq() and irq_to_desc()") added one export for it, but
there were actually two instances of it, in an if/else clause for
CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ.  Add the second one.
