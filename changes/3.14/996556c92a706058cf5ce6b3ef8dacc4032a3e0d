dma: tegra: register as an OF DMA controller

Call of_dma_controller_register() so that DMA clients can look up the
Tegra DMA controller using standard APIs. This requires the of_xlate()
function to save off the DMA slave ID, and for tegra_dma_slave_config()
not to over-write this information; once DMA client drivers are converted
to dma_request_slave_channel() and DT-based lookups, they won't set this
field of struct dma_slave_config anymore.
