HID: sony: Add force-feedback support for the Dualshock 4

Adds the Dualshock 4 to the HID device list and enables force-feedback.

Adds a Dualshock 4 specific worker function since the Dualshock 4 needs a
different report than the Sixaxis.

The right motor in the Dualshock 4 is variable so the full rumble value
is now passed to the worker function and clamped there if necessary.
