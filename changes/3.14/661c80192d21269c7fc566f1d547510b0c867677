x86-64, copy_user: Use leal to produce 32-bit results

When we are using lea to produce a 32-bit result, we can use the leal
form, rather than using leaq and worry about truncation elsewhere.

Make the leal explicit, both to be more obvious and since that is what
gcc generates and thus is less likely to trigger obscure gas bugs.
