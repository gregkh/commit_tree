perf symbols: Prevent the use of kcore if the kernel has moved

Use of kcore is predicated upon it matching the recorded data.  If the
kernel has been relocated at boot time (i.e. since the data was
recorded) then do not use kcore.

Note that it is possible to make a copy of kcore at the time the data is
recorded using 'perf buildid-cache'.  Then the perf tools will use the
copy because it does match the data.
