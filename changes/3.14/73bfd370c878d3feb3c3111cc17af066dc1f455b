netlink: only do not deliver to tap when both sides are kernel sks

We should also deliver packets to nlmon devices when we are in
netlink_unicast_kernel(), and only one of the {src,dst} sockets
is user sk and the other one kernel sk. That's e.g. the case in
netlink diag, netlink route, etc. Still, forbid to deliver messages
from kernel to kernel sks.
