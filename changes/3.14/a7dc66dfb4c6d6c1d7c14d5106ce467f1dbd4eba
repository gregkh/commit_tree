sysfs, kernfs: remove SYSFS_KOBJ_BIN_ATTR

After kernfs_ops and sysfs_dirent->s_attr.size addition, the
distinction between SYSFS_KOBJ_BIN_ATTR and SYSFS_KOBJ_ATTR is only
necessary while creating files to decide which kernfs_ops to use.
Afterwards, they behave exactly the same.

This patch removes SYSFS_KOBJ_BIN_ATTR along with sysfs_is_bin().
sysfs_add_file[_mode_ns]() are updated to take bool @is_bin instead of
@type.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.  This completely
isolates the distinction between the two sysfs file types in the sysfs
layer proper.
