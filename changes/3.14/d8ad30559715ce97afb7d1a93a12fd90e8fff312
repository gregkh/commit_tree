mm/memcg: iteration skip memcgs not yet fully initialized

It is surprising that the mem_cgroup iterator can return memcgs which
have not yet been fully initialized.  By accident (or trial and error?)
this appears not to present an actual problem; but it may be better to
prevent such surprises, by skipping memcgs not yet online.
