zorro/UAPI: Disintegrate include/linux/zorro*.h

The Zorro definitions and device IDs are used by bootstraps, hence they
should be exported through UAPI.

Unfortunately zorro.h was never marked for export when headers_install
was introduced, so it was forgotten during the big UAPI disintegration.
In addition, the removal of zorro_ids.h had been sneaked into commit
7e7a43c32a8970ea2bfc3d1af353dcb1a9237769 ("PCI: don't export device IDs to
userspace") before, so it was also forgotten.

Split off and export the Zorro definitions used by bootstraps.
