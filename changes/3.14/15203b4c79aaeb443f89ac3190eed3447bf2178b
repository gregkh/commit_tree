NFC: nfcmrvl: Add setup handler

Marvell nfc device provides support for external coexistance
control. It allows Device Host to inhibit the NFCC from polling
when required by asserting a GPIO pin. A second pin allows the
DH to have feedback on the current NFCC state.

The required configuration for this feature is done in setup
handler.
