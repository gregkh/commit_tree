ARM: tegra: update DT files to add reset properties

An earlier patch updated the Tegra DT bindings to require resets and
reset-names properties to be filled in. This patch updates the DT files
to include those properties.

Note that any legacy clocks and clock-names entries that are replaced by
reset properties are not yet removed; the drivers must be updated to use
the new resets and reset-names properties first.
