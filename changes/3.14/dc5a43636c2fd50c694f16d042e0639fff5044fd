drm/i915: Eliminate lots of WARNs when there's no backlight present

My 855gm doesn't register the intel backlight but it still ends up
calling the backlight code to enable/disable the backlight via the
LVDS code. This leads to some WARNs due to backlight.max being 0.

Let's have intel_panel_enable_backlight() and intel_panel_disable_backlight()
check whether there's a backlight present or not.

Also move the backlight.present check from asle_set_backlight() into
intel_panel_set_backlight() for some extra symmetry.
