sysfs, kernfs: move dir core code to fs/kernfs/dir.c

Move core dir code to fs/kernfs/dir.c.  fs/sysfs/dir.c now only
contains sysfs_warn_dup() and sysfs wrappers around kernfs interfaces.
The respective declarations in fs/sysfs/sysfs.h are moved to
fs/kernfs/kernfs-internal.h.

This is pure relocation.

v2: sysfs_symlink_target_lock was mistakenly relocated to kernfs.  It
    should remain with sysfs.  Fixed.
