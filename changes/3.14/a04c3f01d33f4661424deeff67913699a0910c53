watchdog: at91sam9_wdt: avoid spurious watchdog reset during init

Use the min_heartbeat value instead of the calculated heartbeat value for
the first watchdog reset to avoid spurious watchdog reset.

Resetting the watchdog counter during init might lead to a watchdog fault
reset because the watchdog counter has to be running for at least
min_heartbeat.

Resetting the watchdog counter after heartbeat might lead to a watchdog
timeout reset because the watchdog counter is running for more than
max_heartbeat time.

Using min_heartbeat instead of heartbeat does not guarantee that the
watchdog won't trigger a reset, but at least it reduces the chances to be
in such a case.
