tracing: Do not add event files for modules that fail tracepoints

If a module fails to add its tracepoints due to module tainting, do not
create the module event infrastructure in the debugfs directory. As the events
will not work and worse yet, they will silently fail, making the user wonder
why the events they enable do not display anything.

Having a warning on module load and the events not visible to the users
will make the cause of the problem much clearer.
