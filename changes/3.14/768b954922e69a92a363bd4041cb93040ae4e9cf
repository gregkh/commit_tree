bonding: fix __get_first_agg RCU usage

Currently, the RCU read lock usage is just wrong - it gets the slave struct
under RCU and continues to use it when RCU lock is released.

However, it's still safe to do this cause we didn't need the
rcu_read_lock() initially - all of the __get_first_agg() callers are either
holding RCU read lock or the RTNL lock, so that we can't sync while in it.
