drm/i915: add intel_display_power_enabled_sw() for use in atomic ctx

Atm we call intel_display_power_enabled() from
i915_capture_error_state() in IRQ context and then take a mutex. To fix
this add a new intel_display_power_enabled_sw() which returns the domain
state based on software tracking as opposed to reading the actual HW
state.

Since we use domain_use_count for this without locking on the reader
side make sure we increase the counter only after enabling all required
power wells and decrease it before disabling any of these power wells.

Regression introduced in
commit 1b02383464b4a915627ef3b8fd0ad7f07168c54c

    drm/i915: support for multiple power wells

Note that atm we depend on the value returned by
intel_display_power_enabled_sw() in i915_capture_error_state() to avoid
unclaimed register access reports. This was never guaranteed though,
since another thread can disable the power concurrently. If this is a
problem we need another explicit way to disable the reporting during
error captures.

v2:
- remove barriers as the caller can't depend on the value
  returned from i915_capture_error_state_sw() anyway (Ville)
- dump the state of pipe/transcoder power domain state (Daniel)
