Revert "PCI: Remove from bus_list and release resources in pci_release_dev()"

Revert commit ef83b0781a73 "PCI: Remove from bus_list and release
resources in pci_release_dev()" that made some nasty race conditions
become possible.  For example, if a Thunderbolt link is unplugged
and then replugged immediately, the pci_release_dev() resulting from
the hot-remove code path may be racing with the hot-add code path
which after that commit causes various kinds of breakage to happen
(up to and including a hard crash of the whole system).

Moreover, the problem that commit ef83b0781a73 attempted to address
cannot happen any more after commit 8a4c5c329de7 "PCI: Check parent
kobject in pci_destroy_dev()", because pci_destroy_dev() will now
return immediately if it has already been executed for the given
device.

Note, however, that the invocation of msi_remove_pci_irq_vectors()
removed by commit ef83b0781a73 from pci_free_resources() along with
the other changes made by it is not added back because of subsequent
code changes depending on that modification.
