USB: EHCI: add delay during suspend to prevent erroneous wakeups

High-speed USB connections revert back to full-speed signalling when
the device goes into suspend.  This takes several milliseconds, and
during that time it's not possible to tell reliably whether the device
has been disconnected.

On some platforms, the Wake-On-Disconnect circuitry gets confused
during this intermediate state.  It generates a false wakeup signal,
which can prevent the controller from going to sleep.

To avoid this problem, this patch adds a 5-ms delay to the
ehci_bus_suspend() routine if any ports have to switch over to
full-speed signalling.  (Actually, the delay was already present for
devices using a particular kind of PHY power management; the patch
merely causes the delay to be used more widely.)
