staging: comedi: cleanup_device() -> comedi_device_detach_cleanup()

Rename the local function `cleanup_device()` to
`comedi_device_detach_cleanup()`.  It is only called from the
`comedi_device_detach()` function and that is called from
`comedi_device_cleanup()` and other places.  The more specific function
name seems less confusing.
