drm: Add panel support

Add a very simple framework to register and lookup panels. Panel drivers
can initialize a DRM panel and register it with the framework, allowing
them to be retrieved and used by display drivers. Currently only support
for DPMS and obtaining panel modes is provided. However it should be
sufficient to enable a large number of panels. The framework should also
be easily extensible to support more sophisticated kinds of panels such
as DSI.

The framework hasn't been tied into the DRM core, even though it should
be easily possible to do so if that's what we want. In the current
implementation, display drivers can simple make use of it to retrieve a
panel, obtain its modes and control its DPMS mode.

Note that this is currently only tested on systems that boot from a
device tree. No glue code has been written yet for systems that use
platform data, but it should be easy to add.
