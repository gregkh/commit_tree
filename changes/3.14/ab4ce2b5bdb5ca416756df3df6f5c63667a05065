crush: clarify numrep vs endpos

Pass numrep (the width of the result) separately from the number of results
we want *this* iteration.  This makes things less awkward when we do a
recursive call (for chooseleaf) and want only one item.

Reflects ceph.git commit 1b567ee08972f268c11b43fc881e57b5984dd08b.
