ARM: tegra: fix node sort order

For Tegra DT files, I've been attempting to keep the nodes sorted in
the order:
1) Nodes with reg, in order of reg.
2) Nodes without reg, alphabetically.

This patch fixes a few escapees that I missed:-(

The diffs look larger than they really are, because sometimes when one
node was moved up or down, diff chose to represent this as many other
nodes being moved the other way!
