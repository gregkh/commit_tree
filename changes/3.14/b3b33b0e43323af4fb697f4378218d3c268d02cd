crush: pass weight vector size to map function

Pass the size of the weight vector into crush_do_rule() to ensure that we
don't access values past the end.  This can happen if the caller misbehaves
and passes a weight vector that is smaller than max_devices.

Currently the monitor tries to prevent that from happening, but this will
gracefully tolerate previous bad osdmaps that got into this state.  It's
also a bit more defensive.

Reflects ceph.git commit 5922e2c2b8335b5e46c9504349c3a55b7434c01a.
