sysfs: fix namespace refcnt leak

As mount() and kill_sb() is not a one-to-one match, we shoudn't get
ns refcnt unconditionally in sysfs_mount(), and instead we should
get the refcnt only when kernfs_mount() allocated a new superblock.

v2:
- Changed the name of the new argument, suggested by Tejun.
- Made the argument optional, suggested by Tejun.

v3:
- Make the new argument as second-to-last arg, suggested by Tejun.
