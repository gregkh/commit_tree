batman-adv: add bonding again

With the new interface alternating, the first hop may send packets
in a round robin fashion to it's neighbors because it has multiple
valid routes built by the multi interface optimization. This patch
enables the feature if bonding is selected. Note that unlike the
bonding implemented before, this version is much simpler and may
even enable multi path routing to a certain degree.
