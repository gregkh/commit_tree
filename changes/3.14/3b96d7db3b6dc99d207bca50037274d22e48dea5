fs/exec.c: call arch_pick_mmap_layout() only once

Currently both setup_new_exec() and flush_old_exec() issue a call to
arch_pick_mmap_layout().  As setup_new_exec() and flush_old_exec() are
always called pairwise arch_pick_mmap_layout() is called twice.

This patch removes one call from setup_new_exec() to have it only called
once.
