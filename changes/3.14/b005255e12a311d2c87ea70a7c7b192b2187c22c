KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Context-switch new POWER8 SPRs

This adds fields to the struct kvm_vcpu_arch to store the new
guest-accessible SPRs on POWER8, adds code to the get/set_one_reg
functions to allow userspace to access this state, and adds code to
the guest entry and exit to context-switch these SPRs between host
and guest.

Note that DPDES (Directed Privileged Doorbell Exception State) is
shared between threads on a core; hence we store it in struct
kvmppc_vcore and have the master thread save and restore it.
