Xen-netback: Fix issue caused by using gso_type wrongly

Current netback uses gso_type to check whether the skb contains
gso offload, and this is wrong. Gso_size is the right one to
check gso existence, and gso_type is only used to check gso type.

Some skbs contains nonzero gso_type and zero gso_size, current
netback would treat these skbs as gso and create wrong response
for this. This also causes ssh failure to domu from other server.

V2: use skb_is_gso function as Paul Durrant suggested
