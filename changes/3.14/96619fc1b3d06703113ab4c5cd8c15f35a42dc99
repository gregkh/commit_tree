s390/smp: reduce memory consumption of pcpu_devices array

Remove the embedded struct cpu from struct pcpu and replace it with a
pointer instead. The struct cpu now gets allocated when a new cpu gets
detected.

The size of the pcpu_devices array (NR_CPUS * sizeof(struct pcpu)) gets
reduced by nearly 120KB.
