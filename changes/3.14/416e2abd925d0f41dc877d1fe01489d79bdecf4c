reiserfs: fix utterly brain-damaged indentation.

This has been this way for years, and every time I stumble across it I
lose my lunch.  After coming across it for the nth time in the Coverity
results, I had to overcome the bystander effect and do something about
it.

This ignores the 79 column limit in favor of making it look like C
instead of gibberish.

The correct thing to do here would be to lose some of the indentation by
breaking this function up into several smaller ones.  I might do that at
some point if I have the stomach to look at this again.

(Also some of those overlong ternary operations would likely be more
readable as regular if's)
