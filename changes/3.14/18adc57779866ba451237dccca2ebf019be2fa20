dm thin: fix deadlock in __requeue_bio_list

The spin lock in requeue_io() was held for too long, allowing deadlock.
Don't worry, due to other issues addressed in the following "dm thin:
fix noflush suspend IO queueing" commit, this code was never called.

Fix this by taking the spin lock for a much shorter period of time.
