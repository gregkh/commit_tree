ASoC: Add support for the Analog Devices AXI-I2S core

This patch adds support for the AXI-I2S softcore. The core implements a simple
bidirectional I2S transceiver and is used by Analog Devices in some of their
reference designs for various FPGA platforms.

The driver uses the generic PCM dmaengine driver for its PCM. The only
restriction is that we need to set the SND_DMAENGINE_PCM_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE flag as
the dmaengine driver for the DMA core (PL330) that is used with this core has no
residue reporting capabilities yet. This will be fixed in the future though.
