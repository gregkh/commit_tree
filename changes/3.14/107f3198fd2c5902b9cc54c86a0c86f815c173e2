clk: composite: .determine_rate support

This commit adds .determine_rate support to the composite clock. It will
use the .determine_rate callback from the rate component if available,
and fall back on the mux component otherwise. This allows composite
clocks to enjoy the benefits of automatic clock reparenting.
