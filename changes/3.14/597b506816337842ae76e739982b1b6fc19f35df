net: irda: ep7211-sir: Remove driver

This patch removes old and unsupported CLPS711X IrDA driver.
Support for IrDA for CLPS711X serial port now provided by commit
4a33f1f59abd (serial: clps711x: Add support for N_IRDA line
discipline), so IrDA-mode can be turned ON with "irattach" tool
through "irtty" driver.
