ARM: at91: fix network interface ordering for sama5d36

On the newly introduced sama5d36, Gigabit and 10/100 Ethernet network
interfaces are probed in a different order than for the sama5d35.
Moreover, users are accustomed to this order in bootloaders and backports
for older kernel revisions.
So this patch switches DT node order as it is done for the other dual-Ethernet
sama5d3 SoC.
Better interface numbering which does not depend on DT node order is being
developed for stronger interface identification.
