MAINTAINERS: Restore "L: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org" entries

A couple of years ago all the "L: lkml" email list entries in
MAINTAINERS were removed and replaced with a 'the rest' entry
at the end of the file - under the theory that this is unnecessary
duplication and that people would find it intuitive:

  b5472cddbe2c MAINTAINERS: remove L: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org from all but "THE REST"

So it turns out that it's all but intuitive, not all people
use scripts/get_maintainer.pl to extract maintainer contact info,
some people read the MAINTAINERS file and see the lack of 'L:' entries
of various lkml-only subsystems and are sending patches to the
maintainers only, without Cc:-ing lkml.  They arguably have a point.

In hindsight removing all the "L: lkml" entries was probably not
an overly good idea, not all mechanic duplication should be eliminated:
in files read by humans it's useful to have 'at a glance' summary for
all email addresses important to a subsystem's maintenance, in a single
place, without too many imported rules and assumptions.

So, to make the lkml fallback really apparent, add back 'L: lkml'
entries to all subsystem entries whose workflow I'm involved in.
This should at minimum be a per subsystem policy thing.
