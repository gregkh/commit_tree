powerpc: Fix races with irq_work

If we set irq_work on a processor and immediately afterward, before the
irq work has a chance to be processed, we change the decrementer value,
we can seriously delay the handling of that irq_work.

Fix it by checking in a few places for pending irq work, first before
changing the decrementer in decrementer_set_next_event() and after
changing it in the same function and in timer_interrupt().
