ACPI / init: Run acpi_early_init() before timekeeping_init()

This is a variant patch from Rafael J. Wysocki's
ACPI / init: Run acpi_early_init() before efi_enter_virtual_mode()

According to Matt Fleming, if acpi_early_init() was executed before
efi_enter_virtual_mode(), the EFI initialization could benefit from
it, so Rafael's patch makes that happen.

And, we want accessing ACPI TAD device to set system clock, so move
acpi_early_init() before timekeeping_init(). This final position is
also before efi_enter_virtual_mode().
