xfs: format log items write directly into the linear CIL buffer

Instead of setting up pointers to memory locations in iop_format which then
get copied into the CIL linear buffer after return move the copy into
the individual inode items.  This avoids the need to always have a memory
block in the exact same layout that gets written into the log around, and
allow the log items to be much more flexible in their in-memory layouts.

The only caveat is that we need to properly align the data for each
iovec so that don't have structures misaligned in subsequent iovecs.

Note that all log item format routines now need to be careful to modify
the copy of the item that was placed into the CIL after calls to
xlog_copy_iovec instead of the in-memory copy.
