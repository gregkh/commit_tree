macvlan: Support creating macvtaps from macvlans

When running in a network namespace whose only link to the outside
world is a macvlan device, not being able to create a macvtap off of
it is a real pain.

So modify macvtap creation to automatically forward a creation of a
macvtap on a macvlan to become a creation of a macvtap on the
underlying network device, just like is currently done with
macvlan-on-macvlan devices.

v2: Use netif_is_macvlan and macvlan_dev_real_dev helpers to make it
    more clear what we're doing.
