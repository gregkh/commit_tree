staging/lustre/llite: Access to released file triggers a restore

When a client accesses data in a released file,
or truncate it, client must trig a restore request.
During this restore, the client must not glimpse and
must use size from MDT. To bring the "restore is running"
information on the client we add a new t_state bit field
to mdt_info which will be used to carry transient file state.
To memorise this information in the inode we add a new flag
LLIF_FILE_RESTORING.
