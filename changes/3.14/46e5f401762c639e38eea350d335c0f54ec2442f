ipv6: add a flag to get the flow label used remotly

This information is already available via IPV6_FLOWINFO
of IPV6_2292PKTOPTIONS, and them a filtering to get the flow label
information. But it is probably logical and easier for users to add this
here, and to control both sent/received flow label values with the
IPV6_FLOWLABEL_MGR option.
