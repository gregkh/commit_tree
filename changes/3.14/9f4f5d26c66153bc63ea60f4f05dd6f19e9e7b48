arm: zynq: Set proper GIC flags

Zynq is able to wake up on any IRQ, so flag it with
IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE, and we want to mask off the IRQs when
going to suspend to avoid transient effects so also flag
this with IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND.

This is essentially, making the same changes as commit
'ARM: ux500: set proper GIC flags'
(sha1: 7e1f97ea8ffa66679252520dbbbd6ec413ecae68) for Zynq.
