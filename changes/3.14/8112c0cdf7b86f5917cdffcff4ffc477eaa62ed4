sb_edac: Mark get_mci_for_node_id as static

This patch marks the function get_mci_for_node_id() as static because it
is not used outside of sb_edac.c.

Thus, it also eliminates the following warning:
drivers/edac/sb_edac.c:918:22: warning: no previous prototype for ‘get_mci_for_node_id’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
