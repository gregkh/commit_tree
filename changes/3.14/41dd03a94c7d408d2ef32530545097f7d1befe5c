powerpc/le: Ensure that the 'stop-self' RTAS token is handled correctly

Currently we're storing a host endian RTAS token in
rtas_stop_self_args.token.  We then pass that directly to rtas.  This is
fine on big endian however on little endian the token is not what we
expect.

This will typically result in hitting:
	panic("Alas, I survived.\n");

To fix this we always use the stop-self token in host order and always
convert it to be32 before passing this to rtas.
