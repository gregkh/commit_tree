sfc: Change priority and flags for automatic MAC filters

MAC filters inserted automatically by the driver, based on the device
address list (EF10) or no-match filters (Siena), should be overridable
at MANUAL or REQUIRED priority.  Currently they themselves have
REQUIRED priority and this requires some odd special-casing.

We also can't reliably tell whether such a MAC filter has or has
not been overridden.  We just remember that it is wanted by the
stack (RX_STACK flag).

Add another priority level, AUTO, between HINT and MANUAL, and
use this for the automatic filters while they have not been
overridden.  Remove the RX_STACK flag.  Add an RX_OVER_AUTO
flag which is set only when an AUTO filter has been overridden
(or was requested to be inserted while a higher-priority filter
existed).
