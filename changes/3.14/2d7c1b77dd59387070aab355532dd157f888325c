ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Remove entries from bus->devices in reverse order

According to the changelog of commit 29ed1f29b68a (PCI: pciehp: Fix null
pointer deref when hot-removing SR-IOV device) it is unsafe to walk the
bus->devices list of a PCI bus and remove devices from it in direct order,
because that may lead to NULL pointer dereferences related to virtual
functions.

For this reason, change all of the bus->devices list walks in
acpiphp_glue.c during which devices may be removed to be carried out in
reverse order.
