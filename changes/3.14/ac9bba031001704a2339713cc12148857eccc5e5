sysfs, kernfs: implement kernfs_ns_enabled()

fs/sysfs/symlink.c::sysfs_delete_link() tests @sd->s_flags for
SYSFS_FLAG_NS.  Let's add kernfs_ns_enabled() so that sysfs doesn't
have to test sysfs_dirent flag directly.  This makes things tidier for
kernfs proper too.

This is purely cosmetic.

v2: To avoid possible NULL deref, use noop dummy implementation which
    always returns false when !CONFIG_SYSFS.
