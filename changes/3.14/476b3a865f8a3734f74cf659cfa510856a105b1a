perf kvm: Fix bug in 'stat report'

When we use perf kvm record-report, there is a bug in report subcommand.

Example:
	# perf kvm stat record -a sleep 1
	[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
	[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.678 MB perf.data.guest (~29641 samples) ]
	# perf kvm stat report
	failed to open perf.data: No such file or directory  (try 'perf record' first)
	Initializing perf session failed

This bug was introduced by f5fc14124.

+       struct perf_data_file file = {
+               .path = input_name,
+               .mode = PERF_DATA_MODE_READ,
+       };

        kvm->tool = eops;
-       kvm->session = perf_session__new(kvm->file_name, O_RDONLY, 0, false,
-                                        &kvm->tool);
+       kvm->session = perf_session__new(&file, false, &kvm->tool);

It changed the path from kvm->file_name to input_name, this patch change the path back to
'kvm->file_name', then it works well.

Verification:
	# perf kvm stat record -a sleep 1
	[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
	[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.807 MB perf.data.guest (~35264 samples) ]
	# perf kvm stat report
