ARM: dts: Add basic support for omap3 LDP zoom1 labrador

Basic things like serial, Ethernet, MMC, NAND, DSS, touchscreen
and GPIO keys work.

For twl4030-keypad we're still missing the binding, but
support for that should be trivial to add once the driver
has been updated.

MUSB I'm pretty sure I got got to enumerate once, but I
suspect the battery charging somehow disrupts it and it's
not enumerating in general for some reason.

Patches are welcome to improve things if people are
still using this board.

For reference, here's some more info on this old board:
