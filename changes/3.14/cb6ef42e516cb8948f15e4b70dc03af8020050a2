EDAC: Correct workqueue setup path

We're using edac_mc_workq_setup() both on the init path, when
we load an edac driver and when we change the polling period
(edac_mc_reset_delay_period) through /sys/.../edac_mc_poll_msec.

On that second path we don't need to init the workqueue which has been
initialized already.

Thanks to Tejun for workqueue insights.
