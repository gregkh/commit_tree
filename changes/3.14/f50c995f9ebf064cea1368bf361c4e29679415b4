tty/serial: at91: fix race condition in atmel_serial_remove

The _remove callback could be called when a tasklet is scheduled. tasklet_kill
was called inside the function in order to free up any scheduled tasklets.
However it was called after uart_remove_one_port which destroys tty references
needed in the port for atmel_tasklet_func.
Simply putting the tasklet_kill at the start of the function will prevent this
conflict.
