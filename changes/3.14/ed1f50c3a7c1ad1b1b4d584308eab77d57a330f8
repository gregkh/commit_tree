net: add skb_checksum_setup

This patch adds a function to set up the partial checksum offset for IP
packets (and optionally re-calculate the pseudo-header checksum) into the
core network code.
The implementation was previously private and duplicated between xen-netback
and xen-netfront, however it is not xen-specific and is potentially useful
to any network driver.
