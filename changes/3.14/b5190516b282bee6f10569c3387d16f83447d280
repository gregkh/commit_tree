of: Move testcase FDT data into drivers/of

The testcase data is usable by any platform. This patch moves it into
the drivers/of directory so it can be included by any architecture.

Using the test cases requires manually adding #include <testcases.dtsi>
to the end of the boards .dtsi file and enabling CONFIG_OF_SELFTEST. Not
pretty though. A useful project would be to make the testcase code
easier to execute.
