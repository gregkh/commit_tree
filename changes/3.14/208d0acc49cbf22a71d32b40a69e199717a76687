nfsd4: break only delegations when appropriate

As a temporary fix, nfsd was breaking all leases on unlink, link,
rename, and setattr.

Now that we can distinguish between leases and delegations, we can be
nicer and break only the delegations, and not bother lease-holders with
operations they don't care about.

And we get to delete some code while we're at it.

Note that in the presence of delegations the vfs calls here all return
-EWOULDBLOCK instead of blocking, so nfsd threads will not get stuck
waiting for delegation returns.
