hpfs: optimize quad buffer loading

HPFS needs to load 4 consecutive 512-byte sectors when accessing the
directory nodes or bitmaps.  We can't switch to 2048-byte block size
because files are allocated in the units of 512-byte sectors.

Previously, the driver would allocate a 2048-byte area using kmalloc,
copy the data from four buffers to this area and eventually copy them
back if they were modified.

In the current implementation of the buffer cache, buffers are allocated
in the pagecache.  That means that 4 consecutive 512-byte buffers are
stored in consecutive areas in the kernel address space.  So, we don't
need to allocate extra memory and copy the content of the buffers there.

This patch optimizes the code to avoid copying the buffers.  It checks
if the four buffers are stored in contiguous memory - if they are not,
it falls back to allocating a 2048-byte area and copying data there.
