ASoC: rsnd: scu cleanup: add rsnd_scu_rate_ctrl()

Renesas sound has SRC (= Sampling Rate Converter),
but, the HW implementation depends on its generation.
It was part of SRU on Gen1, and SCU on Gen2.
This SCU needs DMA transfer to use it.
Current rsnd driver is using it as DMA transfer buffer
(= no rate convert), and Gen1 is only supported at this point.

This patch cleanup it with focusing about SRC and Gen2 part.

rsnd_scu_set_hpbif() is renamed to rsnd_scu_rate_ctrl(),
since its naming doesn't indicate the function meaning.
