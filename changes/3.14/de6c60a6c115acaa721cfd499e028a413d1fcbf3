mm: compaction: encapsulate defer reset logic

Currently there are several functions to manipulate the deferred
compaction state variables.  The remaining case where the variables are
touched directly is when a successful allocation occurs in direct
compaction, or is expected to be successful in the future by kswapd.
Here, the lowest order that is expected to fail is updated, and in the
case of successful allocation, the deferred status and counter is reset
completely.

Create a new function compaction_defer_reset() to encapsulate this
functionality and make it easier to understand the code.  No functional
change.
