ALSA: hda/ca0132 - setup/cleanup streams

When a HDMI stream is opened with the same stream tag
as a following opened stream to ca0132, audio will be
heard from two ports simultaneously.
Fix this issue by change to use snd_hda_codec_setup_stream
and snd_hda_codec_cleanup_stream instead, so that an
inactive stream can be marked as 'dirty' when found
with a conflict stream tag, and then get purified.
