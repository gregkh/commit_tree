sysfs, kernfs: introduce kernfs_create_dir[_ns]()

Introduce kernfs interface to manipulate a directory which takes and
returns sysfs_dirents.

create_dir() is renamed to kernfs_create_dir_ns() and its argumantes
and return value are updated.  create_dir() usages are replaced with
kernfs_create_dir_ns() and sysfs_create_subdir() usages are replaced
with kernfs_create_dir().  Dup warnings are handled explicitly by
sysfs users of the kernfs interface.

sysfs_enable_ns() is renamed to kernfs_enable_ns().

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.

v2: Dummy implementation for !CONFIG_SYSFS updated to return -ENOSYS.

v3: kernfs_enable_ns() added.

v4: Refreshed on top of "sysfs: drop kobj_ns_type handling, take #2"
    so that this patch removes sysfs_enable_ns().
