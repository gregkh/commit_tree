dma-debug: introduce debug_dma_assert_idle()

Record actively mapped pages and provide an api for asserting a given
page is dma inactive before execution proceeds.  Placing
debug_dma_assert_idle() in cow_user_page() flagged the violation of the
dma-api in the NET_DMA implementation (see commit 77873803363c "net_dma:
mark broken").

The implementation includes the capability to count, in a limited way,
repeat mappings of the same page that occur without an intervening
unmap.  This 'overlap' counter is limited to the few bits of tag space
in a radix tree.  This mechanism is added to mitigate false negative
cases where, for example, a page is dma mapped twice and
debug_dma_assert_idle() is called after the page is un-mapped once.
