ASoC: soc-pcm: move DAIs parameters cleaning into hw_free()

We're now applying soc_hw_params_symmetry() to reject unmatched parameters
while we clear parameters in soc_pcm_close(). So here's a use case might be
broken by this mechanism: aplay -Dhw:0 44100.wav 48000.wav 32000.wav

In this case, we call soc_pcm_open()->soc_pcm_hw_params()->soc_pcm_hw_free()
->soc_pcm_hw_params()->soc_pcm_hw_free()->soc_pcm_close() in order. As we
only clear parameters in soc_pcm_close(). The parameters would be remained
in the system even if the playback of 44100.wav is finished.

Thus, this patch is trying to move parameters cleaning into hw_free() so that
the system can continue to serve this kind of use case.

Also, since we set them in hw_params(), it should be better to clear them in
hw_free() for symmetry.
