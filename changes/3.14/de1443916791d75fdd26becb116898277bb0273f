net: unix: non blocking recvmsg() should not return -EINTR

Some applications didn't expect recvmsg() on a non blocking socket
could return -EINTR. This possibility was added as a side effect
of commit b3ca9b02b00704 ("net: fix multithreaded signal handling in
unix recv routines").

To hit this bug, you need to be a bit unlucky, as the u->readlock
mutex is usually held for very small periods.
