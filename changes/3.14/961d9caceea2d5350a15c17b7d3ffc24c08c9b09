ktest: Add BISECT_TRIES to bisect test

For those cases that it takes several tries to hit a bug, it would be
useful for ktest.pl to try a test multiple times before it considers
the test as a pass. To accomplish this, BISECT_TRIES ktest config
option has been added. It is default to one, as most of the time a
bisect only needs to try a test once. But the user can now up this
to make ktest run a given test multiple times. The first failure
that is detected will set a bisect bad. It only repeats on success.

Note, as with all race bugs, there's no guarantee that if it succeeds,
it is really a good bisect. But it helps in case the bug is somewhat
reliable.

You can set BISECT_TRIES to zero, and all tests will be considered
good, unless you also set BISECT_MANUAL.
