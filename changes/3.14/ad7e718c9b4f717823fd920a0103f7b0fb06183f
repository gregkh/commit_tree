nl80211: vendor command support

Add support for vendor-specific commands to nl80211. This is
intended to be used for really vendor-specific functionality
that can't be implemented in a generic fashion for any reason.
It's *NOT* intended to be used for any normal/generic feature
or any optimisations that could be implemented across drivers.

Currently, only vendor commands (with replies) are supported,
no dump operations or vendor-specific notifications.

Also add a function wdev_to_ieee80211_vif() to mac80211 which
is needed for mac80211-based drivers wanting to implement any
vendor commands.
