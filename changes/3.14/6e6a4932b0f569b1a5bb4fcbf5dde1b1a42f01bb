x86, boot: Rename get_flags() and check_flags() to *_cpuflags()

When a function is used in more than one file it may not be possible
to immediately tell from context what the intended meaning is.  As
such, it is more important that the naming be self-evident.  Thus,
change get_flags() to get_cpuflags().

For consistency, change check_flags() to check_cpuflags() even though
it is only used in cpucheck.c.
