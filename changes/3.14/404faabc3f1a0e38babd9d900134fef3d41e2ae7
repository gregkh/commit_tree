drm/i915: vlv: make CRI clock enabling explicit during resume

intel_init_dpio() isn't called during resume, so we won't set the CRI
clock enable bit during that time. Move the enabling to
intel_reset_dpio() instead.

Note that the HW reset value for this bit is 1, so probably this patch
won't make any difference. We should still make the setting explicit,
since BIOS could change things under us.
