SELinux: bigendian problems with filename trans rules

When writing policy via /sys/fs/selinux/policy I wrote the type and class
of filename trans rules in CPU endian instead of little endian.  On
x86_64 this works just fine, but it means that on big endian arch's like
ppc64 and s390 userspace reads the policy and converts it from
le32_to_cpu.  So the values are all screwed up.  Write the values in le
format like it should have been to start.
