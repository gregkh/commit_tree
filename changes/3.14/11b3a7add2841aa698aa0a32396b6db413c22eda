ASoC: restructure dmaengine_pcm_request_chan_of()

Restructure the internals of dmaengine_pcm_request_chan_of() as a loop
over all channels to be allocated. This makes it easier to add logic
that applies to all allocated channels, without having to duplicate that
logic in each of the half-duplex/full-duplex paths.
