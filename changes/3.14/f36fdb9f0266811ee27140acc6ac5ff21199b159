i8k: Force SMM to run on CPU 0

On Studio 1555 with dual-core CPU, reading sensor attributes
exported by this driver resulted in random failures combined
with system hangups and forced logouts. Information in
drivers/firmware/dcdbas.c suggests that SMM accesses must
run on CPU 0. With this patch, the problems are gone,
suggesting that this is in fact the case.

Code derived from drivers/firmware/dcdbas.c.
