inotify: Fix reporting of cookies for inotify events

My rework of handling of notification events (namely commit 7053aee26a35
"fsnotify: do not share events between notification groups") broke
sending of cookies with inotify events. We didn't propagate the value
passed to fsnotify() properly and passed 4 uninitialized bytes to
userspace instead (so it is also an information leak). Sadly I didn't
notice this during my testing because inotify cookies aren't used very
much and LTP inotify tests ignore them.

Fix the problem by passing the cookie value properly.
