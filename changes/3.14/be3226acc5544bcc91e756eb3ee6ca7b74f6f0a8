crush: new SET_CHOOSE_LEAF_TRIES command

Explicitly control the number of sample attempts, and allow the number of
tries in the recursive call to be explicitly controlled via the rule. This
is important because the amount of time we want to spend looking for a
solution may be rule dependent (e.g., higher for the wide indep pool than
the rep pools).

(We should do the same for the other tunables, by the way!)

Reflects ceph.git commit c43c893be872f709c787bc57f46c0e97876ff681.
