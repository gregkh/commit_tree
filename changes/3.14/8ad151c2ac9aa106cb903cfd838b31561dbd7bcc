GFS2: Only run logd and quota when mounted read/write

While investigating a rather strange bit of code in the quota
clean up function, I spotted that the reason for its existence
was that when remounting read only, we were not stopping the
quotad thread, and thus it was possible for it to still have
a reference to some of the quotas in that case.

This patch moves the logd and quota thread start and stop into
the make_fs_rw/ro functions, so that we now stop those threads
when mounted read only.

This means that quotad will always be stopped before we call
the quota clean up function, and we can thus dispose of the
(rather hackish) code that waits for it to give up its
reference on the quotas.
