ALSA: oxygen: export oxygen_update_dac_routing symbol

When the user switches the output from stereo to multichannel
or vice versa, the driver needs to update the channel routing.
Instead of creating additional subroutines, I better export existing
oxygen_update_dac_routing symbol from the oxygen mixer
and call this function. It calls model.adjust_dac_routing()
and my function does the work.
