tty/serial: at91: disable uart timer at start of shutdown

The uart timer will schedule a tasklet when it fires. It is possible that it
can fire inside _shutdown before it is killed in the dma and pdc cleanup
routines. This causes a tasklet that exists after the port is shutdown, so when
the kernel finally executes it, it panics as the tty port is NULL.

This is a somewhat rare condition but its possible if a program keeps on
opening/closing the port. It has been observed in particular with systemd
boot messages that were causing a kernel panic because of this behavior.

Moving the timer deletion to the beginning of the function stops a tasklet from
being scheduled unexpectedly.
