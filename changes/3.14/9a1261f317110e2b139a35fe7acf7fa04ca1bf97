staging: ft1000: fix checkpatch issues in ft1000_poll()

The function ft1000_poll(), in ft1000_hw.c, has many miscellaneous
coding style issues, such as improper indentation, C99 comments, use of
msleep(), and lines over 80 characters. Changes all spaces at the start
of lines to the proper number of tabs. Convert C99 comments to standard
/* */ style. Change calls to msleep(10) to usleep_range(9000, 11000).
Break lines over 80 characters, unless they are user visible strings.
Remove space before open paren in function calls. Fix any other issues
that checkpatch finds.
