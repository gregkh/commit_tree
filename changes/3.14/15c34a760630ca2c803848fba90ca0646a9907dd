ocfs2: fix quota file corruption

Global quota files are accessed from different nodes.  Thus we cannot
cache offset of quota structure in the quota file after we drop our node
reference count to it because after that moment quota structure may be
freed and reallocated elsewhere by a different node resulting in
corruption of quota file.

Fix the problem by clearing dq_off when we are releasing dquot structure.
We also remove the DB_READ_B handling because it is useless -
DQ_ACTIVE_B is set iff DQ_READ_B is set.
