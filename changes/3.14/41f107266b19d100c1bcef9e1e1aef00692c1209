drivers: base: Add prototype declaration to the header file

Add prototype declaration of function memory_block_size_bytes() to
the header file include/linux/memory.h.

This eliminates the following warning in memory.c:
drivers/base/memory.c:87:1: warning: no previous prototype for ‘memory_block_size_bytes’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
