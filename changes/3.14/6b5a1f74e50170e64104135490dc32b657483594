xtensa: fix fast_syscall_spill_registers

The original implementation could clobber registers under certain conditions.

The Xtensa processor architecture uses windowed registers and the original
implementation was using a4 as a temporary register, which under certain
conditions could be register a0 of the oldest window frame, and didn't always
restore the content correctly.

By moving the _spill_registers routine inside the fast system call, it frees
up one more register (the return address is not required anymore) for the
spill routine.
