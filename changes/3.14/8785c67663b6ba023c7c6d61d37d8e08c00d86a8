xen/x86: set VIRQ_TIMER priority to maximum

Commit bee980d9e (xen/events: Handle VIRQ_TIMER before any other hardirq
in event loop) effectively made the VIRQ_TIMER the highest priority event
when using the 2-level ABI.

Set the VIRQ_TIMER priority to the highest so this behaviour is retained
when using the FIFO-based ABI.
