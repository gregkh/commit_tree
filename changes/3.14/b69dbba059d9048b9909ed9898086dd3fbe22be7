powerpc/pseries/cpuidle: Use cpuidle_register() for initialisation.

This patch replaces the cpuidle driver and devices initialisation
calls with a single generic cpuidle_register() call
and also includes minor refactoring of the code around it.

Remove the cpu online check in snooze loop, as this code can
only locally run on a cpu only if it is online. Therefore,
this check is not required.
