dt/bindings: remove users of device_type "mdio"

device_type is a deprecated property, but some MDIO bus nodes still have
it. Except for a couple of old binding (compatible="gianfar" and
compatible="ucc_geth_phy") the kernel doesn't look for
device_type="mdio" at all.

This patch removes all instances of device_type="mdio" from the binding
documentation and the .dts files.
