cgroup: remove cftype->read(), ->read_map() and ->write()

In preparation of conversion to kernfs, cgroup file handling is being
consolidated so that it can be easily mapped to the seq_file based
interface of kernfs.

After recent updates, ->read() and ->read_map() don't have any user
left and ->write() never had any user.  Remove them.
