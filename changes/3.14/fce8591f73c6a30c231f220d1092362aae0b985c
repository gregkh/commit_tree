PCI: designware: Fix I/O transfers by using CPU (not realio) address

pp->io_base, which is the input of the outbound IO address translation
unit, should be the CPU address.  It was incorrectly programmed to the
realio address.

We should pass global_io_offset rather than sys->io_offset to
pci_ioremap_io(), so we map the new window into the first available spot in
the Linux view of the I/O space.

We must also pass CPU address instead of realio address to pci_ioremap_io().

This patch fixes above issue.  It has been tested with Lecroy PTC in AIC
mode and Pericom PI7C9X2G303EL PCIe switch, which does not work otherwise.
