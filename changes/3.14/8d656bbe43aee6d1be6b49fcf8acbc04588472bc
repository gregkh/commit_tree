xen/pvh: Load GDT/GS in early PV bootup code for BSP.

During early bootup we start life using the Xen provided
GDT, which means that we are running with %cs segment set
to FLAT_KERNEL_CS (FLAT_RING3_CS64 0xe033, GDT index 261).

But for PVH we want to be use HVM type mechanism for
segment operations. As such we need to switch to the HVM
one and also reload ourselves with the __KERNEL_CS:eip
to run in the proper GDT and segment.

For HVM this is usually done in 'secondary_startup_64' in
(head_64.S) but since we are not taking that bootup
path (we start in PV - xen_start_kernel) we need to do
that in the early PV bootup paths.

For good measure we also zero out the %fs, %ds, and %es
(not strictly needed as Xen has already cleared them
for us). The %gs is loaded by 'switch_to_new_gdt'.
