drivers: gpu: Include appropriate header file in ci_smc.c

Include header file drm/radeon/ci_dpm.h in drm/radeon/ci_smc.c because
it uses function declared in the header file.

This eliminates the following warnings in drm/radeon/ci_smc.c:
drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/ci_smc.c:46:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘ci_copy_bytes_to_smc’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
