[media] media: v4l2-dev: fix video device index assignment

The side effect of commit 1056e4388b045 ("v4l2-dev: Fix race condition on
__video_register_device") is the increased number of index value assigned
on video_device registration. Before that commit video_devices were
numbered from 0, after it, the indexes starts from 1, because get_index()
always count the device, which is being registered. Some device drivers
rely on video_device index number for internal purposes, i.e. s5p-mfc
driver stopped working after that patch. This patch restores the old method
of numbering the video_device indexes.
