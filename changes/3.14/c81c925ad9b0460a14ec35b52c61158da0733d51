cgroup: factor out cgroup_subsys_state creation into create_css()

Now that all opertations to create a css (cgroup_subsys_state) are
collected into a single loop in cgroup_create(), it's easy to factor
it out into its own function.  Factor out css creation into
create_css().  This makes the code easier to follow and will enable
decoupling css creation from cgroup creation which is necessary for
the planned unified hierarchy.
