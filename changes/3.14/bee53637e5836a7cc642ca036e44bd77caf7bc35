USB: c67x00: remove CONFIG_USB_DEBUG dependancy

This removes the usage of CONFIG_USB_DEBUG in the c67x00 driver.  There
was only one place, where the TD was dumped to the kernel log, and that
was using the dynamic debug infrastructure already, with the exception
of the call to print_hex_dump().  So move everything to the dynamic
debug infrastructure, including one odd printk(KERN_DEBUG...) line that
looks like it was forgotten about a long time ago.
