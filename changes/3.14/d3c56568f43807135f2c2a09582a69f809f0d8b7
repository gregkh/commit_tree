ALSA: hda/realtek - Avoid invalid COEFs for ALC271X

We've seen often problems after suspend/resume on Acer Aspire One
AO725 with ALC271X codec as reported in kernel bugzilla, and it turned
out that some COEFs doesn't work and triggers the codec communication
stall.

Since these magic COEF setups are specific to ALC269VB for some PLL
configurations, the machine works even without these manual
adjustment.  So, let's simply avoid applying them for ALC271X.
