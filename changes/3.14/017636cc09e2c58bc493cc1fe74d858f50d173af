drm/i915: Disable LP1+ watermarks safely in init

ILK doesn't like if we just write the LP1+ watermarks registers with 0.
We need to just disable the watermarks by clearing the enable bit. Use
that method also when disabling LP1+ watermarks in init_clock_gating.

It looks like disabling the sprite LP1 watermarks can cause underruns
even if we just toggle the WM1S_LP_EN bit. So treat that bit like the
actual watermark numbers and avoid setting it to 0 immediately.
