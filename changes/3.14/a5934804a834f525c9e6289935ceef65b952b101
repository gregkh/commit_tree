n_tty: Fix poll() when TIME_CHAR and MIN_CHAR == 0

Commit eafbe67f84761d787802e5113d895a316b6292fe,
  n_tty: Refactor input_available_p() by call site
broke poll() when TIME_CHAR(tty) and MIN_CHAR(tty) are both 0.

When TIME_CHAR and MIN_CHAR are both 0, input is available if the
read_cnt is 1 (not 0).
