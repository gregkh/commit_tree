drm/radeon: clean up active vram sizing

If we are not able to properly initialize one of the gpu
engines for buffer paging, we limit vram to the size of
the cpu visible aperture.  We generally either use the gfx
or dma engine to do this.  Clean up the size limiting code
to only adjust the size based on what ring is selected
for buffer paging rather than making assumptions about which
engine is selected for paging.
