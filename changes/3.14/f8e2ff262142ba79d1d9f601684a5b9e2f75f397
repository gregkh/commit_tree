[media] omap3isp: Modify clocks registration to avoid circular references

The clock core code is going to be modified so clk_get() takes
reference on the clock provider module. Until the potential circular
reference issue is properly addressed, we pass NULL as the first
argument to clk_register(), in order to disallow sub-devices taking
a reference on the ISP module back trough clk_get(). This should
prevent locking the modules in memory.
