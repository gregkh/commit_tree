drm/i915/ppgtt: Defer request freeing on reset

We need to defer the free request until the object/vma is capable of
being freed - or else we have a problem  when we try to destroy the
context.

The exact same issue is described and fixed here:

    drm/i915: Defer request freeing

I had this fix previously, but decided not to keep it for some reason I
can no longer remember.

gem_reset_stats is a really good test at hitting the problem.

v2: Whitespace fix. (Chris)

Note: This is a bug that only hits the ppgtt topic branch but I've
figured that doing the request cleanup in this order is generally the
right thing to do.

[danvet: Add a code comment to clarify what's actually going on since
the lifetime rules aroung ppgtt cleanup are ... fuzzy a best atm. Also
add a note about why we need this.]
