sysfs, kernfs: make super_blocks bind to different kernfs_roots

kernfs is being updated to allow multiple sysfs_dirent hierarchies so
that it can also be used by other users.  Currently, sysfs
super_blocks are always attached to one kernfs_root - sysfs_root - and
distinguished only by their namespace tags.

This patch adds sysfs_super_info->root and update
sysfs_fill/test_super() so that super_blocks are identified by the
combination of both the associated kernfs_root and namespace tag.
This allows mounting different kernfs hierarchies.
