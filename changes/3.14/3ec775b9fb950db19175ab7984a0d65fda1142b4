bonding: handle slave's name change with primary_slave logic

Currently, if a slave's name change, we just pass it by. However, if the
slave is a current primary_slave, then we end up with using a slave, whose
name != params.primary, for primary_slave. And vice-versa, if we don't have
a primary_slave but have params.primary set - we will not detected a new
primary_slave.

Fix this by catching the NETDEV_CHANGENAME event and setting primary_slave
accordingly. Also, if the primary_slave was changed, issue a reselection of
the active slave, cause the priorities have changed.
