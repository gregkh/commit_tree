ARM: ignore memory below PHYS_OFFSET

If the kernel is loaded higher in physical memory than normal, and we
calculate PHYS_OFFSET higher than the start of RAM, this leads to
boot problems as we attempt to map part of this RAM into userspace.
Rather than struggle with this, just truncate the mapping.
