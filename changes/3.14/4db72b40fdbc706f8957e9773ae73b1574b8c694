nfs: add memory barriers around NFS_INO_INVALID_DATA and NFS_INO_INVALIDATING

If the setting of NFS_INO_INVALIDATING gets reordered to before the
clearing of NFS_INO_INVALID_DATA, then another task may hit a race
window where both appear to be clear, even though the inode's pages are
still in need of invalidation. Fix this by adding the appropriate memory
barriers.
