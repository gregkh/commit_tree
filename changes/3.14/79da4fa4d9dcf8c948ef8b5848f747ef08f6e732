btrfs: publish unknown feature bits in sysfs

With the compat and compat-ro bits, it's possible for file systems to
exist that have features that aren't supported by the kernel's file system
implementation yet still be mountable.

This patch publishes read-only info on those features using a prefix:number
format, where the number is the bit number rather than the shifted value.
e.g. "compat:12"
