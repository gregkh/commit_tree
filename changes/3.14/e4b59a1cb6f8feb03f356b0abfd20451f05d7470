net/mlx4_en: Ignore irrelevant hypervisor events

MLX4_DEV_EVENT_SLAVE_INIT and MLX4_DEV_EVENT_SLAVE_SHUTDOWN
events used by Hypervisor to inform the PPF IB driver that
IB para-virtualization must be initialized/destroyed for a slave.
If this event is catched by ETH VF annoying but harmless error message
is printed into dmesg. Remove dmesg prints for these events.
