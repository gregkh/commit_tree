[SCSI] sr: use block layer runtime PM

Migrate sr to make use of block layer runtime PM. Accordingly, the
SCSI bus layer runtime PM callback is simplified as all SCSI drivers
implementing runtime PM now use the block layer's request-based
mechanism.

Note that due to the device will be polled by kernel at a constant
interval, if the autosuspend delay is set longer than the polling
interval then the device will never suspend.
