xtensa: remap io area defined in device tree

Use the simple-bus node to discover the io area, and remap the cached and
bypass io ranges. The parent-bus-address value of the first triplet in the
"ranges" property is used. This value is rounded down to the nearest 256MB
boundary. The length of the io area is fixed at 256MB; the "ranges" property
length value is ignored.

Other limitations: (1) only the first simple-bus node is considered, and (2)
only the first triplet of the "ranges" property is considered.

See ePAPR 1.1 ยง6.5 for the simple-bus node description, and ยง2.3.8 for the
"ranges" property description.
