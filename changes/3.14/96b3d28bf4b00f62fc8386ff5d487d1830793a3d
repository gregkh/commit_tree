sched/clock: Prevent tracing recursion in sched_clock_cpu()

Prevent tracing of preempt_disable/enable() in sched_clock_cpu().
When CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is enabled, preempt_disable/enable() are
traced and this causes trace_clock() users (and probably others) to
go into an infinite recursion. Systems with a stable sched_clock()
are not affected.

This problem is similar to that fixed by upstream commit 95ef1e52922
("KVM guest: prevent tracing recursion with kvmclock").
