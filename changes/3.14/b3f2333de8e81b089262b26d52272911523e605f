drm: restrict the device list for shadow attached drivers

There's really no need for the drm core to keep a list of all
devices of a given driver - the linux device model keeps perfect
track of this already for us.

The exception is old legacy ums drivers using pci shadow attaching.
So rename the lists to make the use case clearer and rip out everything
else.

v2: Rebase on top of David Herrmann's drm device register changes.
Also drop the bogus dev_set_drvdata for platform drivers that somehow
crept into the original version - drivers really should be in full
control of that field.

v3: Initialize driver->legacy_dev_list outside of the loop, spotted by
David Herrmann.

v4: Rebase on top of the newly created host1x drm_bus for tegra.
