[media] vb2: Improve file I/O emulation to handle buffers in any order

videobuf2 file I/O emulation assumed that buffers dequeued from the
driver would return in the order they were enqueued in the driver.

Improve the file I/O emulator's book-keeping to remove this assumption.

Also set the buf->size properly if a write() dequeues a buffer and the
VB2_FILEIO_WRITE_IMMEDIATELY flag is set.

Based on an initial patch by Andy Walls.
