vmxnet3: fix netpoll race condition

vmxnet3's netpoll driver is incorrectly coded.  It directly calls
vmxnet3_do_poll, which is the driver internal napi poll routine.  As the netpoll
controller method doesn't block real napi polls in any way, there is a potential
for race conditions in which the netpoll controller method and the napi poll
method run concurrently.  The result is data corruption causing panics such as this
one recently observed:

The fix is to do as other drivers do, and have the poll controller call the top
half interrupt handler, which schedules a napi poll properly to recieve frames

Tested by myself, successfully.
