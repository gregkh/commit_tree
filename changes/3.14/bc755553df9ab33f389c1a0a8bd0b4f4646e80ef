sysfs, kernfs: make inode number ida per kernfs_root

kernfs is being updated to allow multiple sysfs_dirent hierarchies so
that it can also be used by other users.  Currently, inode number is
allocated using a global ida, sysfs_ino_ida; however, inos for
different hierarchies should be handled separately.

This patch makes ino allocation per kernfs_root.  sysfs_ino_ida is
replaced by kernfs_root->ino_ida and sysfs_new_dirent() is updated to
take @root and allocate ino from it.  ida_simple_get/remove() are used
instead of sysfs_ino_lock and sysfs_alloc/free_ino().
