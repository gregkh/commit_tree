ASoC: Allow PCMs to restrict the supported formats

Some DMA cores might add additional restrictions on which in memory audio
formats can be supported by the compound sound card. If the PCM component
specifies a set of formats it supports (by setting the formats field to non 0)
take these into account when calculating the format set for the compound sound
card.
