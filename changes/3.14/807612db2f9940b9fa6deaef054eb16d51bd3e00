fs/super.c: sync ro remount after blocking writers

Move sync_filesystem() after sb_prepare_remount_readonly().  If writers
sneak in anywhere from sync_filesystem() to sb_prepare_remount_readonly()
it can cause inodes to be dirtied and writeback to occur well after
sys_mount() has completely successfully.

This was spotted by corrupted ubifs filesystems on reboot, but appears
that it can cause issues with any filesystem using writeback.
