Revert "xhci: replace xhci_write_64() with writeq()"

This reverts commit 7dd09a1af2c7150269350aaa567a11b06e831003.

Many xHCI host controllers can only handle 32-bit addresses, and writing
64-bits at a time causes them to fail.  Rafał reports that USB devices
simply do not enumerate, and reverting this patch helps.  Branimir
reports that his host controller doesn't respond to an Enable Slot
command and dies:
