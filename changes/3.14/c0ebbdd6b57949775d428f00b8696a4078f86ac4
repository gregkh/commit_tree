can: gw: remove obsolete checks

In commit be286bafe1f4069094865264f29805854c5788bf ("can: gw: add a variable
limit for CAN frame routings") the detection of the frame routing has been
changed. The former solution required dev->header_ops to be unused (== NULL).

I missed to remove the obsolete checks in the original commit - so here it is.
