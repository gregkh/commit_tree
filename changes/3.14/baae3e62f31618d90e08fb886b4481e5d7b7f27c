netfilter: nf_tables: fix chain type module reference handling

The chain type module reference handling makes no sense at all: we take
a reference immediately when the module is registered, preventing the
module from ever being unloaded.

Fix by taking a reference when we're actually creating a chain of the
chain type and release the reference when destroying the chain.
