ACPI, APEI, GHES: Do not report only correctable errors with SCI

Currently SCI is employed to handle corrected errors - memory corrected
errors, more specifically but in fact SCI still can be used to handle
any errors, e.g. uncorrected or even fatal ones if enabled by the BIOS.
Enable logging for those kinds of errors too.
