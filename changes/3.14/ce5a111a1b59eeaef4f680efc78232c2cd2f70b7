Documentation: i2c: Remove obsolete example

Documentation/i2c/fault-codes illustrates EINVAL error code
as follows:

"One example would be a driver trying an SMBus Block Write
with block size outside the range of 1-32 bytes."

However, the actual implementation of i2c subsystem truncates
data length to be 32 bytes.
Hence this example cannot happen anymore, and since it's obsolete,
let's simply remove it from Documentation/i2c/fault-codes.
