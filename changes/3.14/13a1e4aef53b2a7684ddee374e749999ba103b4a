tracing: Consolidate event trigger code

The event trigger code that checks for callback triggers before and
after recording of an event has lots of flags checks. This code is
duplicated throughout the ftrace events, kprobes and system calls.
They all do the exact same checks against the event flags.

Added helper functions ftrace_trigger_soft_disabled(),
event_trigger_unlock_commit() and event_trigger_unlock_commit_regs()
that consolidated the code and these are used instead.
