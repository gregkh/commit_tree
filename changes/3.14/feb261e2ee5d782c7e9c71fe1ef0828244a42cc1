aoe: Convert to immutable biovecs

Now that we've got a mechanism for immutable biovecs -
bi_iter.bi_bvec_done - we need to convert drivers to use primitives that
respect it instead of using the bvec array directly.

The aoe code no longer has to manually iterate over partial bvecs, so
some struct members go away - other struct members are effectively
renamed:

buf->resid	-> buf->iter.bi_size
buf->sector	-> buf->iter.bi_sector

f->bcnt		-> f->iter.bi_size
f->lba		-> f->iter.bi_sector
