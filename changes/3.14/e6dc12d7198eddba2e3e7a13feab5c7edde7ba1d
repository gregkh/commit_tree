ASoC: fsl_sai: Move the global registers setting to _dai_probe()

Because we cannot make sure which one of _dai_fmt() and _dai_sysclk()
will be firstly called. So move the RCSR/TCSR and TCR1/RCR1's
initialization to _dai_probe(), and this can make sure that before any
of {T,R}CR{1~5} register to be set the RCSR/TCSR's RE/TE bit has been
cleared for the hareware limitation.
