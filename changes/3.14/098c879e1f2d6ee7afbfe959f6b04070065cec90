tracing: Add generic tracing_lseek() function

Trace event triggers added a lseek that uses the ftrace_filter_lseek()
function. Unfortunately, when function tracing is not configured in
that function is not defined and the kernel fails to build.

This is the second time that function was added to a file ops and
it broke the build due to requiring special config dependencies.

Make a generic tracing_lseek() that all the tracing utilities may
use.

Also, modify the old ftrace_filter_lseek() to return 0 instead of
1 on WRONLY. Not sure why it was a 1 as that does not make sense.

This also changes the old tracing_seek() to modify the file pos
pointer on WRONLY as well.
