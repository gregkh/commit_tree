posix-timers: Remove remaining uses of tasklist_lock

The remaining uses of tasklist_lock were mostly about synchronizing
against sighand modifications, getting coherent and safe group samples
and also thread/process wide timers list handling.

All of this is already safely synchronizable with the target's
sighand lock. Let's use it on these places instead.

Also update the comments about locking.
