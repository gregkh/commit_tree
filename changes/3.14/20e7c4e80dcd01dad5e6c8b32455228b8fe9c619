6lowpan: fix lockdep splats

When a device ndo_start_xmit() calls again dev_queue_xmit(),
lockdep can complain because dev_queue_xmit() is re-entered and the
spinlocks protecting tx queues share a common lockdep class.

Same issue was fixed for bonding/l2tp/ppp in commits

0daa2303028a6 ("[PATCH] bonding: lockdep annotation")
49ee49202b4ac ("bonding: set qdisc_tx_busylock to avoid LOCKDEP splat")
23d3b8bfb8eb2 ("net: qdisc busylock needs lockdep annotations ")
303c07db487be ("ppp: set qdisc_tx_busylock to avoid LOCKDEP splat ")
