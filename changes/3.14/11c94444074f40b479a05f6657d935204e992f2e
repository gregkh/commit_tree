block: Fix type mismatch in ssize_t_blk_mq_tag_sysfs_show

cppcheck detected following format string mismatch.
[blk-mq-tag.c:201]: (warning) %u in format string (no. 1) requires
'unsigned int' but the argument type is 'int'.

Change "cpu" from int to unsigned int, because the cpu
never become minus value.
