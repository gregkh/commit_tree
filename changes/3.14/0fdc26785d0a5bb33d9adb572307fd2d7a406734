sunrpc: get rid of use_gssp_lock

We can achieve the same result with a cmpxchg(). This also fixes a
potential race in use_gss_proxy(). The value of sn->use_gss_proxy could
go from -1 to 1 just after we check it in use_gss_proxy() but before we
acquire the spinlock. The procfile write would end up returning success
but the value would flip to 0 soon afterward. With this method we not
only avoid locking but the first "setter" always wins.
