cgroup: combine css handling loops in cgroup_create()

Now that css operations in cgroup_create() are back-to-back, there
isn't much point in allocating css's in one loop and onlining them in
another.  Merge the two loops so that a css is allocated and onlined
on each iteration.

css_ar[] is no longer necessary and replaced with a single pointer.
This also simplifies the error handling path.
