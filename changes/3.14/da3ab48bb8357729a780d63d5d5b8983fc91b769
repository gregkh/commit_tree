staging: ft1000: remove formal function headers from ft1000_hw.c

The file ft1000_hw.c contains formal C99 style function headers that
waste space and convey little to no useful information. This patch
converts the headers to either one line standard /* */ style comments
or shorter standard style headers with parameter lists (if the parameter
list seemed helpful), or eliminates them entirely. Besides needing to be
made of its own accord, this change is in preparation to eliminate the
nonstandard STATUS_* #defines from the driver since they were cited in most
of the headers.
