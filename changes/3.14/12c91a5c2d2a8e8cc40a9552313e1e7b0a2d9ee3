dm space map common: make sure new space is used during extend

When extending a low level space map we should update nr_blocks at
the start so the new space is used for the index entries.

Otherwise extend can fail, e.g.: sm_metadata_extend call sequence
that fails:
 -> sm_ll_extend
    -> dm_tm_new_block -> dm_sm_new_block -> sm_bootstrap_new_block
    => returns -ENOSPC because smm->begin == smm->ll.nr_blocks
