s390/sclp_early: Add function to detect sclp console capabilities

Add SCLP console detect functions to encapsulate detection of SCLP console
capabilities, for example, VT220 support.  Reuse the sclp_send/receive masks
that were stored by the most recent sclp_set_event_mask() call to prevent
unnecessary SCLP calls.
