printk: flush conflicting continuation line

An earlier newline was missing and current print is from different task.
In this scenario flush the continuation line and store this line
seperatly.

This patch fix the below scenario of timestamp interleaving,
   [   28.154370 ] read_word_reg : reg[0x 3], reg[0x 4]  data [0x 642]
   [   28.155428 ] uart disconnect
   [   31.947341 ] dvfs[cpufreq.c<275>]:plug-in cpu<1> done
   [   28.155445 ] UART detached : send switch state 201
   [   32.014112 ] read_reg : reg[0x 3] data[0x21]
