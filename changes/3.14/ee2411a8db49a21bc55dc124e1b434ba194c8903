GFS2: Clean up quota slot allocation

Quota slot allocation has historically used a vector of pages
and a set of homegrown find/test/set/clear bit functions. Since
the size of the bitmap is likely to be based on the default
qc file size, thats a couple of pages at most. So we ought
to be able to allocate that as a single chunk, with a vmalloc
fallback, just in case of memory fragmentation.

We are then able to use the kernel's own find/test/set/clear
bit functions, rather than rolling our own.
