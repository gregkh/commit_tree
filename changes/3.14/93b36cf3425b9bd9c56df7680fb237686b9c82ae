ipv6: support IPV6_PMTU_INTERFACE on sockets

IPV6_PMTU_INTERFACE is the same as IPV6_PMTU_PROBE for ipv6. Add it
nontheless for symmetry with IPv4 sockets. Also drop incoming MTU
information if this mode is enabled.

The additional bit in ipv6_pinfo just eats in the padding behind the
bitfield. There are no changes to the layout of the struct at all.
