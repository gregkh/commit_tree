cifs: Rename and cleanup open_query_close_cifs_symlink()

Rename open_query_close_cifs_symlink to cifs_query_mf_symlink() to make
the name more consistent with other protocol version specific functions.

We also pass tcon as an argument to the function. This is already
available in the calling functions and we can avoid having to make an
unnecessary lookup.
