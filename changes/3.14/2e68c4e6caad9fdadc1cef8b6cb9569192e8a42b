dm cache: add policy name to status output

The cache's policy may have been established using the "default" alias,
which is currently the "mq" policy but the default policy may change in
the future.  It is useful to know exactly which policy is being used.

Add a 'real' member to the dm_cache_policy_type structure and have the
"default" dm_cache_policy_type point to the real "mq"
dm_cache_policy_type.  Update dm_cache_policy_get_name() to check if
real is set, if so report the name of the real policy (not the alias).
