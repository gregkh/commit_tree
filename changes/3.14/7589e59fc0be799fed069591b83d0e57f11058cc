gpiolib: unify pr_* messages format

This patch includes the following amendments:
 1) use "?" as a label when the last one is not defined in gpiod_*;
 2) whenever it's possible gpiod_* are used;
 3) print a function name, if it's already used in other messages.

Additionally it fixes an indentation in few places.
