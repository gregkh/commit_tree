sctp: move skb_dst_set() a bit downwards in sctp_packet_transmit()

skb_dst_set will use dst, if dst is NULL although is not a problem,
then goto the 'no_route' and free nskb, so do the skb_dst_set is pointless.
so move the skb_dst_set after dst check.
Remove the unnecessary initialization as well.

v2: fix the subject line because it would confuse people,
    as pointed out by Daniel.
