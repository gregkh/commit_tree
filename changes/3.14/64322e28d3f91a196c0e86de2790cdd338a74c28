wl1251: fix scan behaviour while not associated

With a dissasociated card I often encoutered very long scan delays.

My guess is that it has something to do with the cards DTIM handling and
another firmware bug mentioned in the TI WLAN driver, which is described as
the card may never end scanning if the channel is overloaded because it
can't send probe requests. I think the firmware somehow also tries to
receive DTIM messages when the BSSID is not set. Therefore most of the time
it waits for DTIM messages and can't do scanning work.

Anyway we can workaround this misbehaviour by setting the HIGH_PRIORITY
bit for scans in disassociated state.
