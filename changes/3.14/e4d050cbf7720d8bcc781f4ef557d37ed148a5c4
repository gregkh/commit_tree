tipc: eliminate code duplication in media layer

Currently TIPC supports two L2 media types, Ethernet and Infiniband.
Because both these media are accessed through the common net_device API,
several functions in the two media adaptation files turn out to be
fully or almost identical, leading to unnecessary code duplication.

In this commit we extract this common code from the two media files
and move them to the generic bearer.c. Additionally, we change
the function names to reflect their real role: to access L2 media,
irrespective of type.
