PCI/MSI: Remove pci_enable_msi_block_auto()

The new pci_msi_vec_count() interface makes pci_enable_msi_block_auto()
superfluous.

Drivers can use pci_msi_vec_count() to learn the maximum number of MSIs
supported by the device, and then call pci_enable_msi_block().

pci_enable_msi_block_auto() was introduced recently, and its only user is
the AHCI driver, which is also updated by this change.
