Staging: vt6656: Correct single space mistakes

Adds missing spaces between an if-statement and its condition as well
as between the condition and the following curly brace. At casts
there is also a space added between the type and the variable.

Spaces that either follow an opening parenthese or the sizeof operator
or that preceed semicolons are removed as well.
