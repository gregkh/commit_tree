arm64: cmpxchg: update macros to prevent warnings

Make sure the value we are going to return is referenced in order to
avoid warnings from newer GCCs such as:

arch/arm64/include/asm/cmpxchg.h:162:3: warning: value computed is not used [-Wunused-value]
  ((__typeof__(*(ptr)))__cmpxchg_mb((ptr),   \
   ^
net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.c:674:2: note: in expansion of macro ‘cmpxchg’
  cmpxchg(&nf_conntrack_hash_rnd, 0, rand);

[Modified to use the current underlying implementation as current
mainline for both cmpxchg() and cmpxchg_local() does -- broonie]
