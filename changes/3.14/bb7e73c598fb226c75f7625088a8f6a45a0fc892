tty/serial: at91: reset rx_ring when port is shutdown

When using RX DMA, the driver won't pass any data to the uart layer
until the buffer is flipped. When the port is shutdown, the dma buffers
are unmapped, but the head and tail of the ring buffer are not reseted.
Since the serial console will keep the port open, this will only
present itself when the uart is not shared.

To reproduce the issue, with an unpatched driver, run a getty on /dev/ttyS0
with no serial console and exit. Getty will exit, and when the new one returns
you will be unable to log in.  If you hold down a key long enough to fill the
DMA buffer and flip it, you can then log in.
