[media] omap3isp: ccdc: Don't hang when the SBL fails to become idle

Under abnormal conditions (such as glitches on the HSYNC/VSYNC signals)
the CCDC output SBL can fail to become idle. The driver currently logs
this condition to the kernel log and doesn't restart the CCDC. This
results in CCDC video capture hanging without any notification to
userspace.

Cancel the pipeline and mark the CCDC as crashed instead of hanging.
Userspace will be notified of the problem and will then be able to close
and reopen the device to trigger a reset of the ISP.
