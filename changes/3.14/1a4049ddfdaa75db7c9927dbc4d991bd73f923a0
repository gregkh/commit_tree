[SCSI] aci7xxx_old: delete decade+ obsolete driver

After getting warnings in an allyesconfig build[1] from this
driver, I decided to remind myself just how old it was, and
whether it warranted fixing.  In the Kconfig help text, I found:

  "This driver will eventually be phased out entirely"

Going back to the history archive, I see the line was added[2]
in Feb 2002, when we moved from v2.4.2.1 ---> v2.4.2.2

So, with over a decade of notification, and multiple major releases
since then, I think we can justify removing this.  Currently we have
people wasting time building it during routine testing, and then
wasting more time re-researching the known reported warnings, only to
find that nobody really is willing to integrate the fixes[3] for it.

A quick search didn't seem to indicate any active user base for it.
If someone happens to have a quirky _old_ card that the eleven year
old "new" driver doesn't work with, then it is entirely reasonable
that they stick with a kernel version that predates this removal.
