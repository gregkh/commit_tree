KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Implement architecture compatibility modes for POWER8

This allows us to select architecture 2.05 (POWER6) or 2.06 (POWER7)
compatibility modes on a POWER8 processor.  (Note that transactional
memory is disabled for usermode if either or both of the PCR_TM_DIS
and PCR_ARCH_206 bits are set.)
