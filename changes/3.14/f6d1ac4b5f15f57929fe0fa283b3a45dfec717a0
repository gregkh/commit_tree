qlge: Do not propaged vlan tag offloads to vlans

qlge driver turns off NETIF_F_HW_CTAG_FILTER, but forgets to
turn off HW_CTAG_TX and HW_CTAG_RX on vlan devices.  With the
current settings, q-in-q will only generate a single vlan header.
Remember to mask off CTAG_TX and CTAG_RX features in vlan_features.
