mtd: nand: pxa3xx: make ECC configuration checks more explicit

The Armada BCH configuration in this driver uses one of the two
following ECC schemes:

 16-bit correction per 2048 bytes
 16-bit correction per 1024 bytes

These are sufficient for mapping to the 4-bit per 512-bytes and 8-bit
per 512-bytes (respectively) minimum correctability requirements of many
common NAND.

The current code only checks for the required strength (4-bit or 8-bit)
without checking the ECC step size that is associated with that strength
(and simply assumes it is 512). While that is often a safe assumption to
make, let's make it explicit, since we have that information.
