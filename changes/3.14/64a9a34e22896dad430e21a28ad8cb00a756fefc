mm: numa: do not automatically migrate KSM pages

KSM pages can be shared between tasks that are not necessarily related
to each other from a NUMA perspective.  This patch causes those pages to
be ignored by automatic NUMA balancing so they do not migrate and do not
cause unrelated tasks to be grouped together.
