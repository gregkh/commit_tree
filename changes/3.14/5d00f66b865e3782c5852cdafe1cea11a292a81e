KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Prepare for host using hypervisor doorbells

POWER8 has support for hypervisor doorbell interrupts.  Though the
kernel doesn't use them for IPIs on the powernv platform yet, it
probably will in future, so this makes KVM cope gracefully if a
hypervisor doorbell interrupt arrives while in a guest.
