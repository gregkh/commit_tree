bonding: create bond_first_slave_rcu()

The bond_first_slave_rcu() will be used to instead of bond_first_slave()
in rcu_read_lock().

According to the Jay Vosburgh's suggestion, the struct netdev_adjacent
should hide from users who wanted to use it directly. so I package a
new function to get the first slave of the bond.
