s390/qdio: for_each macro correctness

I observed that there are for_each macros that do an extra memory access
beyond the defined area.
Normally this does not cause problems.
But, this can cause exceptions. For example: if the area is allocated at
the end of a page and the next page is not accessible.

For correctness, I suggest changing the arguments of the 'for loop' like
others 'for_each' do in the kernel.
