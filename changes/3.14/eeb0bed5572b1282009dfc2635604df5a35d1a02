libceph: add ceph_kv{malloc,free}() and switch to them

Encapsulate kmalloc vs vmalloc memory allocation and freeing logic into
two helpers, ceph_kvmalloc() and ceph_kvfree(), and switch to them.

ceph_kvmalloc() kmalloc()'s a maximum of 8 pages, anything bigger is
vmalloc()'ed with __GFP_HIGHMEM set.  This changes the existing
behaviour:

- for buffers (ceph_buffer_new()), from trying to kmalloc() everything
  and using vmalloc() just as a fallback

- for messages (ceph_msg_new()), from going to vmalloc() for anything
  bigger than a page

- for messages (ceph_msg_new()), from disallowing vmalloc() to use high
  memory
