staging/lustre/llite: extended attribute cache

This patch implements an extended attribute cache for
a Lustre client. It is organized as a write-through
cache: reads are performed from cache, updates are sent
synchronously to the MDS. An additional inode bit
MDS_INODELOCK_XATTR is added to protect the cache.
