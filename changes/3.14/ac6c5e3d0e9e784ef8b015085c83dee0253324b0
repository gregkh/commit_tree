i40e: only set up the rings to be used

The VSI may be allocated more queues (alloc_queue_pairs) than actually
are to be used (num_queue_pairs), so only allocate rings for the queues
to be used.  The numbers will likely be the same for most VSIs, but can
be different based on how TCs are assigned and enabled.
