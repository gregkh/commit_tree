net: cdc_ncm: fix control message ordering

This is a context modified revert of commit 6a9612e2cb22
("net: cdc_ncm: remove ncm_parm field") which introduced
a NCM specification violation, causing setup errors for
some devices. These errors resulted in the device and
host disagreeing about shared settings, with complete
failure to communicate as the end result.

The NCM specification require that many of the NCM specific
control reuests are sent only while the NCM Data Interface
is in alternate setting 0. Reverting the commit ensures that
we follow this requirement.
