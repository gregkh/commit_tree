sctp: Reorder 'struc association' members to reduce its size

Members of 'struct association' are not in appropriate order to
reuse compiler added padding on 64bit architectures. In this patch
we reorder those struct members and help reduce the size of the
structure from 2776 bytes to 2720 bytes on 64 bit architectures.
