usb: cdc-wdm: resp_count can be 0 even if WDM_READ is set

Do not decrement resp_count if it's already 0.

We set resp_count to 0 when the device is closed.  The next open and
read will try to clear the WDM_READ flag if there was leftover data
in the read buffer. This fix is necessary to prevent resubmitting
the read URB in a tight loop because resp_count becomes negative.

The bug can easily be triggered from userspace by not reading all
data in the read buffer, and then closing and reopening the chardev.
