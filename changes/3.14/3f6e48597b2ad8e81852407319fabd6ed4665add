parport: parport_pc: fix id print of a device

Since commit 7106b4e3 ("8250: Oxford Semiconductor Devices") the debug
print of the device id does no longer match the real device if it is
located in the "enum" behind oxsemi_pcie_pport. The reason is that the
code assumes that each id contains one entry in the PCI table.
The fix is to lookup the currently used id from the id-> parameter.
