powerpc: purge all the prefetched instructions for the coherent icache flush

As Benjamin Herrenschmidt has indicated, we still need a dummy icbi to
purge all the prefetched instructions from the ifetch buffers for the
snooping icache. We also need a sync before the icbi to order the
actual stores to memory that might have modified instructions with
the icbi.
