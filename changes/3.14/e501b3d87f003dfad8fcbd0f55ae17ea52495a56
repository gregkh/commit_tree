agp: Support 64-bit APBASE

Per the AGP 3.0 spec, APBASE is a standard PCI BAR and may be either 32
bits or 64 bits wide.  Many drivers read APBASE directly, but they only
handled 32-bit BARs.

The PCI core reads APBASE at enumeration-time.  Use pci_bus_address()
instead of reading it again in the driver.  This works correctly for both
32-bit and 64-bit BARs.
