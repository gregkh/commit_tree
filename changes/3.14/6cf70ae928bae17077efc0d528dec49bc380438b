i2c: mv64xxx: Fix bus hang on A0 version of the Armada XP SoCs

The first variants of Armada XP SoCs (A0 stepping) have issues related
to the i2c controller which prevent to use the offload mechanism and
lead to a kernel hang during boot.

The commit introduces a new the compatible string
marvell,mv78230-a0-i2c for the i2c controller. When this compatible
string is used the driver disables the offload mechanism and the
kernel no more hangs on these SoCs.
