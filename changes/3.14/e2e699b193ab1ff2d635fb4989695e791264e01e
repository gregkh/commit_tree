ARM: OMAP2+: gpmc: Move initialization outside the gpmc_t condition

This commit moves a bunch of initialization previously enclosed
under a 'if (gpmc_t)' check, to be outside such condition.

These initializations are not related to gpmc_t (timings) in any way
so it's nonsense to enclose them under such check.
