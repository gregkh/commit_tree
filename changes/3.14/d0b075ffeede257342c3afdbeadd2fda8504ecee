xen/events: Refactor evtchn_to_irq array to be dynamically allocated

Refactor static array evtchn_to_irq array to be dynamically allocated by
implementing get and set functions for accesses to the array.

Two new port ops are added: max_channels (maximum supported number of
event channels) and nr_channels (number of currently usable event
channels).  For the 2-level ABI, these numbers are both the same as
the shared data structure is a fixed size. For the FIFO ABI, these
will be different as the event array is expanded dynamically.

This allows more than 65000 event channels so an unsigned short is no
longer sufficient for an event channel port number and unsigned int is
used instead.
