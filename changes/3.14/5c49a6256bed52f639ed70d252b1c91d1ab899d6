charger-manager: Modify the way of checking battery's temperature

Charger-manager driver used to check battery temperature through the
callback function passed by platform data. Unfortunatley, without that
pre-defined callback function, charger-manager can't get battery's
temperature at all. Also passing callback function through platform data
ruins DT support for charger-manager.

This patch mondifies charger-manager driver to get temperature of battery
without pre-defined callback function. Now, charger-manager can use either
of battery thermometer in fuel-gauge and ouside of battery. It uses
thermal framework interface for outer thermometer if thermal fw is
enabled. Otherwise, it tries to use fuel-gauge's through the power supply
interface.
