staging: comedi: fix result of memdup_user for user chanlist

If the channel list is not set in userspace we get an error at
PTR_ERR(async->cmd.chanlist). However, do_become_nonbusy(dev, s) cleans
up this pointer which causes a kernel ooops. Setting the channel list in
async to NULL and checking this in do_become_nonbusy prevents the oops.

[Ian Abbott] Also do the same for the chanlist allocated in
do_cmdtest_ioctl().
