staging: ft1000: remove unused variable nxtph

The function ft1000_poll, in ft1000_hw.c, is overly complex, with at
least five different levels of nesting. While preparing to extract one
of the cases to its own function, I discovered that the variable nxtph
is not used. It is declared and assigned a value in ft1000_poll(), then
passed by reference to the helper function ft1000_receive_command(),
which receives it as parameter. pnxtph does not appear in the body of
this function. Remove all occurrences of nxtph and pnxtph.
