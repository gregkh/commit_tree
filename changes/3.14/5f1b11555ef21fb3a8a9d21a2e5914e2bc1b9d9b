i2c: s3c2410: fix quirk usage for 64-bit

If used 64 bit compiler GCC warns that:

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-s3c2410.c: In function ‘s3c24xx_get_device_quirks’:
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-s3c2410.c:168:10: warning: cast from pointer to integer
of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]

This patch fixes this by converting "unsigned int" to "kernel_ulong_t".
