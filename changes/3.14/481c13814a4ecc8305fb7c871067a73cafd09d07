ACPICA: Remove bool usage from ACPICA.

The use of "bool" is not safe for ACPICA code where it is originally using
a "BOOLEAN" defined as "unsigned char".

This patch removes the only "bool" usage from kernel source tree to reduce
the source code differences between Linux and ACPICA upstream.

This patch is required by future acpidump release automation.
