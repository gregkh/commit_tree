Btrfs: introduce a head ref rbtree

The way how we process delayed refs is
1) get a bunch of head refs,
2) pick up one head ref,
3) go one node back for any delayed ref updates.

The head ref is also linked in the same rbtree as the delayed ref is,
so in 1) stage, we have to walk one by one including not only head refs, but
delayed refs.

When we have a great number of delayed refs pending to process,
this'll cost time a lot.

Here we introduce a head ref specific rbtree, it only has head refs, so troubles
go away.
