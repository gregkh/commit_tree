[media] sn9c102: prepare for removal by moving it to staging

During the last media summit meeting it was decided to move this driver to
staging as the first step to removing it altogether.

Most webcams covered by this driver are now supported by gspca. Nobody has the
hardware to convert the remaining devices to gspca.

This driver needs a major overhaul to have it conform to the latest frameworks
and compliancy tests.

Without hardware, however, this is next to impossible. Given the fact that
this driver seems to be pretty much unused (it has been removed from Fedora
several versions ago and nobody complained about that), we decided to drop
this driver.

This patch moves it to staging. Some time in 2014 we will drop it completely.
