PCI: Convert pcibios_resource_to_bus() to take a pci_bus, not a pci_dev

These interfaces:

  pcibios_resource_to_bus(struct pci_dev *dev, *bus_region, *resource)
  pcibios_bus_to_resource(struct pci_dev *dev, *resource, *bus_region)

took a pci_dev, but they really depend only on the pci_bus.  And we want to
use them in resource allocation paths where we have the bus but not a
device, so this patch converts them to take the pci_bus instead of the
pci_dev:

  pcibios_resource_to_bus(struct pci_bus *bus, *bus_region, *resource)
  pcibios_bus_to_resource(struct pci_bus *bus, *resource, *bus_region)

In fact, with standard PCI-PCI bridges, they only depend on the host
bridge, because that's the only place address translation occurs, but
we aren't going that far yet.
