drivers: gpu: Mark function as static in mgag200_main.c

Mark function mgag200_bo_unref() as static in drm/mgag200/mgag200_main.c
because it is not used outside this file.

This eliminates the following warning in drm/mgag200/mgag200_main.c:
drivers/gpu/drm/mgag200/mgag200_main.c:313:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘mgag200_bo_unref’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
