KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add new state for transactional memory

Add new state for transactional memory (TM) to kvm_vcpu_arch.  Also add
asm-offset bits that are going to be required.

This also moves the existing TFHAR, TFIAR and TEXASR SPRs into a
CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM section.  This requires some code changes to
ensure we still compile with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=N.  Much of the added
the added #ifdefs are removed in a later patch when the bulk of the TM code is
added.
