net: correct error path in rtnl_newlink()

I saw the following BUG when ->newlink() fails in rtnl_newlink():

[   40.240058] kernel BUG at net/core/dev.c:6438!

this is due to free_netdev() is not supposed to be called before
netdev is completely unregistered, therefore it is not correct
to call free_netdev() here, at least for ops->newlink!=NULL case,
many drivers call it in ->destructor so that rtnl_unlock() will
take care of it, we probably don't need to do anything here.
