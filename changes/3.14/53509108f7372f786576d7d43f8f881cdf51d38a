ASoC: twl6040: Custom caching for sensitive DL1/2 path registers

Introduce a small register cache for registers which needs special caching
to reduce pop noise:
TWL6040_REG_HSLCTL, TWL6040_REG_HSRCTL, TWL6040_REG_EARCTL, TWL6040_REG_HFLCTL
and TWL6040_REG_HFRCTL.
Switch over and use the new small cache for these registers instead of the
main reg_cache.
This is in preparation to remove the local ASoC reg_cache from the driver.
