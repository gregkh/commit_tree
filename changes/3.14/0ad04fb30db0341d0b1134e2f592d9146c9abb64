ARM: SA1100: Create dummy clk_get_rate() to avoid build failures

There are some parts of common kernel which would be using routines
like clk_get_rate() on some platforms. Currently, they wouldn't be
called for SA1100 boards, but they are needed for successful kernel
compilation.

Create a dummy clk_get_rate() routine for SA1100 which can be called
by the cpufreq core. More dummy routines might be added later if
necessary.
