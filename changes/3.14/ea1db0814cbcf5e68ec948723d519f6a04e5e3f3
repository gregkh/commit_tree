staging/lustre/llite: use correct FID in ll_och_fill()

When ll_intent_file_open() is called on a file with a stale dentry,
ll_och_fill() may incorrectly use the FID from the struct
ll_inode_info rather than the FID from the response body (which is the
correct FID for the close). Fix this, remove the ll_inode_info
parameter from ll_och_fill(), and move the call to ll_ioepoch_open()
from ll_och_fill() to ll_local_open().
