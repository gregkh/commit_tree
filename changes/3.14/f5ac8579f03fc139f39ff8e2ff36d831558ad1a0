i40e: use correct struct for get and update vsi params

The get_vsi_params and update_vsi_params functions were using a
different command struct that just happened to have an seid element in
the right place and so worked correctly anyway.  This patch fixes the
functions to use the right data struct.

There is no actual logic change.
