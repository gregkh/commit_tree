KVM: arm-vgic: Make vgic mmio functions more generic

Rename the vgic_ranges array to vgic_dist_ranges to be more specific and
to prepare for handling CPU interface register access as well (for
save/restore of VGIC state).

Pass offset from distributor or interface MMIO base to
find_matching_range function instead of the physical address of the
access in the VM memory map.  This allows other callers unaware of the
VM specifics, but with generic VGIC knowledge to reuse the function.
