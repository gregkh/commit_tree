bridge: Fix handling stacked vlan tags

If a bridge with vlan_filtering enabled receives frames with stacked
vlan tags, i.e., they have two vlan tags, br_vlan_untag() strips not
only the outer tag but also the inner tag.

br_vlan_untag() is called only from br_handle_vlan(), and in this case,
it is enough to set skb->vlan_tci to 0 here, because vlan_tci has already
been set before calling br_handle_vlan().
