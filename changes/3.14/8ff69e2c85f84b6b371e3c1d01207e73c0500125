memcg: do not use vmalloc for mem_cgroup allocations

The vmalloc was introduced by 33327948782b ("memcgroup: use vmalloc for
mem_cgroup allocation"), because at that time MAX_NUMNODES was used for
defining the per-node array in the mem_cgroup structure so that the
structure could be huge even if the system had the only NUMA node.

The situation was significantly improved by commit 45cf7ebd5a03 ("memcg:
reduce the size of struct memcg 244-fold"), which made the size of the
mem_cgroup structure calculated dynamically depending on the real number
of NUMA nodes installed on the system (nr_node_ids), so now there is no
point in using vmalloc here: the structure is allocated rarely and on
most systems its size is about 1K.
