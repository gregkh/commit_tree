drivers/gpu/drm/gma500/backlight.c: fix a defined-but-not-used warning for do_gma_backlight_set()

Fix the following warning:

	drivers/gpu/drm/gma500/backlight.c:29:13: warning: 'do_gma_backlight_set' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

by moving the entire function inside the conditional section currently
inside of it.  All the places that call it are so conditionalised.
