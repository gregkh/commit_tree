perf/x86: Add Intel RAPL PMU support

This patch adds a new uncore PMU to expose the Intel
RAPL energy consumption counters. Up to 3 counters,
each counting a particular RAPL event are exposed.

The RAPL counters are available on Intel SandyBridge,
IvyBridge, Haswell. The server skus add a 3rd counter.

The following events are available and exposed in sysfs:

  - power/energy-cores: power consumption of all cores on socket
  - power/energy-pkg: power consumption of all cores + LLc cache
  - power/energy-dram: power consumption of DRAM (servers only)

For each event both the unit (Joules) and scale (2^-32 J)
is exposed in sysfs for use by perf stat and other tools.
The files are:

	/sys/devices/power/events/energy-*.unit
	/sys/devices/power/events/energy-*.scale

The RAPL PMU is uncore by nature and is implemented such
that it only works in system-wide mode. Measuring only
one CPU per socket is sufficient. The /sys/devices/power/cpumask
file can be used by tools to figure out which CPUs to monitor
by default. For instance, on a 2-socket system, 2 CPUs
(one on each socket) will be shown.

All the counters measure in the same unit (exposed via sysfs).
The perf_events API exposes all RAPL counters as 64-bit integers
counting in unit of 1/2^32 Joules (about 0.23 nJ). User level tools
must convert the counts by multiplying them by 2^-32 to obtain
Joules. The reason for this is that the kernel avoids
doing floating point math whenever possible because it is
expensive (user floating-point state must be saved). The method
used avoids kernel floating-point usage. There is no loss of
precision. Thanks to PeterZ for suggesting this approach.

To convert the raw count in Watt:
   W = C * 2.3 / (1e10 * time)
or ldexp(C, -32).

RAPL PMU is a new standalone PMU which registers with the
perf_event core subsystem. The PMU type (attr->type) is
dynamically allocated and is available from /sys/device/power/type.

Sampling is not supported by the RAPL PMU. There is no
privilege level filtering either.
