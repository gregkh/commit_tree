dm: Refactor for new bio cloning/splitting

We need to convert the dm code to the new bvec_iter primitives which
respect bi_bvec_done; they also allow us to drastically simplify dm's
bio splitting code.

Also, it's no longer necessary to save/restore the bvec array anymore -
driver conversions for immutable bvecs are done, so drivers should never
be modifying it.

Also kill bio_sector_offset(), dm was the only user and it doesn't make
much sense anymore.
