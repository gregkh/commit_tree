block: Generic bio chaining

This adds a generic mechanism for chaining bio completions. This is
going to be used for a bio_split() replacement, and it turns out to be
very useful in a fair amount of driver code - a fair number of drivers
were implementing this in their own roundabout ways, often painfully.

Note that this means it's no longer to call bio_endio() more than once
on the same bio! This can cause problems for drivers that save/restore
bi_end_io. Arguably they shouldn't be saving/restoring bi_end_io at all
- in all but the simplest cases they'd be better off just cloning the
bio, and immutable biovecs is making bio cloning cheaper. But for now,
we add a bio_endio_nodec() for these cases.
