ixgbe: Use static inlines instead of macros

Kernel coding standard prefers static inline functions instead
of macros, so use them for register accessors. This is to prepare
for adding LER, Live Error Recovery, checks to those accessors.

Temporarily provide macros for calling the new static inline
accessors until all references are changed.
