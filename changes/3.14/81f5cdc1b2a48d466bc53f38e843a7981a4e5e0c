backlight: kb3886_bl: fix incorrect placement of __initdata marker

The __initdata marker can be virtually anywhere on the line, EXCEPT right
after "struct".  The preferred location is before the "=" sign if there is
one, or before the trailing ";" otherwise.  It also fixes the following
chechpatch warning.

  WARNING: __initdata should be placed after kb3886bl_device_table[]
