perf: Fix PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD to force-reset the period

Vince Weaver reports that, on all architectures apart from ARM,
PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD doesn't actually update the period until the next
event fires. This is counter-intuitive behaviour and is better dealt
with in the core code.

This patch ensures that the period is forcefully reset when dealing with
such a request in the core code. A subsequent patch removes the
equivalent hack from the ARM back-end.
