Revert "btrfs: add ioctl to export size of global metadata reservation"

This reverts commit 01e219e8069516cdb98594d417b8bb8d906ed30d.

David Sterba found a different way to provide these features without adding a new
ioctl.  We haven't released any progs with this ioctl yet, so I'm taking this out
for now until we finalize things.
