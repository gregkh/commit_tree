ASoC: dpcm: Allow PCMs to omit the set of supported formats

Allow PCMs that do not impose any restrictions on the supported formats to set
the formats field to 0, Instead of assuming that this means that the PCM does
not support any formats (which doesn't make much sense), assume that it supports
all formats. This brings the behavior of DPCM closer to that of non-DPCM.
