sysfs, kernfs: revamp sysfs_dirent active_ref lockdep annotation

Currently, sysfs_dirent active_ref lockdep annotation uses
attribute->[s]key as the lockdep key, which forces
kernfs_create_file_ns() to assume that sysfs_dirent->priv is pointing
to a struct attribute which may not be true for non-sysfs users.  This
patch restructures the lockdep annotation such that

* kernfs_ops contains lockdep_key which is used by default for files
  created kernfs_create_file_ns().

* kernfs_create_file_ns_key() is introduced which takes an extra @key
  argument.  The created file will use the specified key for
  active_ref lockdep annotation.  If NULL is specified, lockdep for
  the file is disabled.

* sysfs_add_file_mode_ns() is updated to use
  kernfs_create_file_ns_key() with the appropriate key from the
  attribute or NULL if ignore_lockdep is set.

This makes the lockdep annotation properly contained in kernfs while
allowing sysfs to cleanly keep its current behavior.  This patch
doesn't introduce any behavior differences.
