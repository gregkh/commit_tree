[media] em28xx: use a better value for I2C timeouts

In the lack of a better spec, let's assume the timeout
values compatible with SMBus spec:
	http://smbus.org/specs/smbus110.pdf

at chapter 8 - Electrical Characteristics of SMBus devices

Ok, SMBus is a subset of I2C, and not all devices will be
following it, but the timeout value before this patch was not
even following the spec.

So, while we don't have a better guess for it, use 35 + 1
ms as the timeout.
