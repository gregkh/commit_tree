ASoC: dapm: Add locking to snd_soc_dapm_xxxx_pin functions

The snd_soc_dapm_xxxx_pin all require the dapm_mutex to be held when
they are called as they edit the dirty list, however very few of the
callers do so.

This patch adds unlocked versions of all the functions replacing the
existing implementations with one that holds the lock internally. We
also fix up the places where the lock was actually held on the caller
side.
