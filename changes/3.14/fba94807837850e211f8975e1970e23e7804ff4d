cgroup, memcg: move cgroup->event_list[_lock] and event callbacks into memcg

cgroup_event is being moved from cgroup core to memcg and the
implementation is already moved by the previous patch.  This patch
moves the data fields and callbacks.

* cgroup->event_list[_lock] are moved to mem_cgroup.

* cftype->[un]register_event() are moved to cgroup_event.  This makes
  it impossible for individual cftype definitions to specify their
  event callbacks.  This is worked around by simply hard-coding
  filename to event callback mapping in cgroup_write_event_control().
  This is awkward and inflexible, which is actually desirable given
  that we don't want to grow more usages of this feature.

* eventfd_ctx declaration is removed from cgroup.h, which makes
  vmpressure.h miss eventfd_ctx declaration.  Include eventfd.h from
  vmpressure.h.

v2: Use file name from dentry instead of cftype.  This will allow
    removing all cftype handling in the function.
