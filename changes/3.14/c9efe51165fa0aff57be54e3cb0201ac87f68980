fix a kmap leak in virtio_console

While we are at it, don't do kmap() under kmap_atomic(), *especially*
for a page we'd allocated with GFP_KERNEL.  It's spelled "page_address",
and had that been more than that, we'd have a real trouble - kmap_high()
can block, and doing that while holding kmap_atomic() is a Bad Idea(tm).
