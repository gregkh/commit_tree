PM / hibernate: Fix restore hang in freeze_processes()

During restore, pm_notifier chain are called with
PM_RESTORE_PREPARE.  The firmware_class driver handler
fw_pm_notify does not have a handler for this.  As a result,
it keeps a reader on the kmod.c umhelper_sem.  During
freeze_processes, the call to __usermodehelper_disable tries to
take a write lock on this semaphore and hangs waiting.
