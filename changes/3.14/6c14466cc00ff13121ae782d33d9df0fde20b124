mm: improve documentation of page_order

Developers occasionally try and optimise PFN scanners by using
page_order but miss that in general it requires zone->lock.  This has
happened twice for compaction.c and rejected both times.  This patch
clarifies the documentation of page_order and adds a note to
compaction.c why page_order is not used.
