Input: joystick - use sizeof(VARIABLE) in documentation

Use the preferred style sizeof(VARIABLE) instead of sizeof(TYPE) in the
joystick API documentation, Documentation/CodingStyle states that this
is the preferred style for allocations but using it elsewhere is good
too.

Also fix some errors like "sizeof(struct mybuffer)" which didn't mean
anything.
