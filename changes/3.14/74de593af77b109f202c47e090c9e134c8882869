f2fs: read contiguous sit entry pages by merging for mount performance

Previously we read sit entries page one by one, this method lost the chance
of reading contiguous page together. So we read pages as contiguous as
possible for better mount performance.

change log:
 o merge judgements/use 'Continue' or 'Break' instead of 'Goto' as Gu Zheng
   suggested.
 o add mark_page_accessed() before release page to delay VM reclaiming.
 o remove '*order' for simplification of function as Jaegeuk Kim suggested.
