Btrfs: fix assert screwup for the pending move stuff

Wang noticed that he was failing btrfs/030 even though me and Filipe couldn't
reproduce.  Turns out this is because Wang didn't have CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT set,
which meant that a key part of Filipe's original patch was not being built in.
This appears to be a mess up with merging Filipe's patch as it does not exist in
his original patch.  Fix this by changing how we make sure del_waiting_dir_move
asserts that it did not error and take the function out of the ifdef check.
This makes btrfs/030 pass with the assert on or off.  Thanks,
