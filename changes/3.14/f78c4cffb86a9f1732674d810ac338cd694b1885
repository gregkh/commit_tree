PM / Sleep: Add macro to define common late/early system PM callbacks

We use the same approach as for the existing SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS,
but for the late and early callbacks instead.

The new SET_LATE_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS, defined for CONFIG_PM_SLEEP, will
point ->suspend_late, ->freeze_late and ->poweroff_late to the same
function. Vice verse happens for ->resume_early, ->thaw_early and
->restore_early.
