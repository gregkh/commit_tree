amd64_edac: Mark amd64_decode_bus_error as static

This patch marks the function amd64_decode_bus_error() as static because
it is not used outside of amd64_edac.c.

It also eliminates the following warning:
drivers/edac/amd64_edac.c:2038:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘amd64_decode_bus_error’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
