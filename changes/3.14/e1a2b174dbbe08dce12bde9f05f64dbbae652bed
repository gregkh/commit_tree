perf kvm: Move code to generate filename for perf-kvm to function.

The code in builtin-kvm.c to generate filename for perf-kvm is useful to
other command such as builtin-diff.

This patch move the related code form builtin-kvm.c to util/util.c and
wrap them in a function named get_filename_for_perf_kvm.
