i40e: Fix SR-IOV VF port VLAN

This patch fixes two different problems.
1) The port VLAN configuration was not persistent across VF driver
   loads and unloads.

2) The port VLAN configuration was only correct the first time it was
   set. Switching the port VLAN on and off would cause subsequent VLAN
   configurations to be corrupted in the VSI.  Ensure that the correct
   bits are being set for the VSI port VLAN configuration.
