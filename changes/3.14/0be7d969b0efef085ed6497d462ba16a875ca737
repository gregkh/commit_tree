powerpc/fsl_booke: smp support for booting a relocatable kernel above 64M

When booting above the 64M for a secondary cpu, we also face the
same issue as the boot cpu that the PAGE_OFFSET map two different
physical address for the init tlb and the final map. So we have to use
switch_to_as1/restore_to_as0 between the conversion of these two
maps. When restoring to as0 for a secondary cpu, we only need to
return to the caller. So add a new parameter for function
restore_to_as0 for this purpose.

Use LOAD_REG_ADDR_PIC to get the address of variables which may
be used before we set the final map in cams for the secondary cpu.
Move the setting of cams a bit earlier in order to avoid the
unnecessary using of LOAD_REG_ADDR_PIC.
