nfs: increment i_dio_count for reads, too

i_dio_count is used to protect dio access against truncate.  We want
to make sure there are no dio reads pending either when doing a
truncate.  I suspect on plain NFS things might work even without
this, but once we use a pnfs layout driver that access backing devices
directly things will go bad without the proper synchronization.
