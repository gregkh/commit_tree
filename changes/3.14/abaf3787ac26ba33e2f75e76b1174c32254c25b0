fs/proc: don't use module_init for non-modular core code

PROC_FS is a bool, so this code is either present or absent.  It will
never be modular, so using module_init as an alias for __initcall is
rather misleading.

Fix this up now, so that we can relocate module_init from init.h into
module.h in the future.  If we don't do this, we'd have to add module.h to
obviously non-modular code, and that would be ugly at best.

Note that direct use of __initcall is discouraged, vs.  one of the
priority categorized subgroups.  As __initcall gets mapped onto
device_initcall, our use of fs_initcall (which makes sense for fs code)
will thus change these registrations from level 6-device to level 5-fs
(i.e.  slightly earlier).  However no observable impact of that small
difference has been observed during testing, or is expected.

Also note that this change uncovers a missing semicolon bug in the
registration of vmcore_init as an initcall.
