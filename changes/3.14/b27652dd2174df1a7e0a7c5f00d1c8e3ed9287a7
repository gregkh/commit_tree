powerpc: introduce early_get_first_memblock_info

For a relocatable kernel since it can be loaded at any place, there
is no any relation between the kernel start addr and the memstart_addr.
So we can't calculate the memstart_addr from kernel start addr. And
also we can't wait to do the relocation after we get the real
memstart_addr from device tree because it is so late. So introduce
a new function we can use to get the first memblock address and size
in a very early stage (before machine_init).
