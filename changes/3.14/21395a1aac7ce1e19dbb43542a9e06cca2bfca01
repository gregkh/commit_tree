usb: chipidea: move malloced regmap directly into struct hw_bank

Without this patch a seperate chunk of memory is allocated for the regmap
array. As the regmap is always used it makes no sense to allocate a seperate
memory block for it, this patch moves the regmap array directly into the struct
hw_bank.
