ARM: 7950/1: mm: Fix stage-2 device memory attributes

The stage-2 memory attributes are distinct from the Hyp memory
attributes and the Stage-1 memory attributes.  We were using the stage-1
memory attributes for stage-2 mappings causing device mappings to be
mapped as normal memory.  Add the S2 equivalent defines for memory
attributes and fix the comments explaining the defines while at it.

Add a prot_pte_s2 field to the mem_type struct and fill out the field
for device mappings accordingly.
