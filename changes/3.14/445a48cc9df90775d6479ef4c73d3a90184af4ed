net: ethoc: don't advertise gigabit speed on attached PHY

OpenCores 10/100 Mbps MAC does not support speeds above 100 Mbps, but does
not disable advertisement when PHY supports them. This results in
non-functioning network when the MAC is connected to a gigabit PHY connected
to a gigabit switch.

The fix is to disable gigabit speed advertisement on attached PHY
unconditionally.
