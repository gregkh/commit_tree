sched/deadline: Add latency tracing for SCHED_DEADLINE tasks

It is very likely that systems that wants/needs to use the new
SCHED_DEADLINE policy also want to have the scheduling latency of
the -deadline tasks under control.

For this reason a new version of the scheduling wakeup latency,
called "wakeup_dl", is introduced.

As a consequence of applying this patch there will be three wakeup
latency tracer:

 * "wakeup", that deals with all tasks in the system;
 * "wakeup_rt", that deals with -rt and -deadline tasks only;
 * "wakeup_dl", that deals with -deadline tasks only.
