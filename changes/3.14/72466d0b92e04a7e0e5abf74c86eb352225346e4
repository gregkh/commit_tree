ceph: fix posix ACL hooks

The merge of commit 7221fe4c2ed7 ("ceph: add acl for cephfs") raced with
upstream changes in the generic POSIX ACL code (eg commit 2aeccbe957d0
"fs: add generic xattr_acl handlers" and others).

Some of the fallout was fixed in commit 4db658ea0ca ("ceph: Fix up after
semantic merge conflict"), but it was incomplete: the set_acl
inode_operation wasn't getting set, and the prototype needed to be
adjusted a bit (it doesn't take a dentry anymore).
