[SCSI] hpsa: prevent stalled i/o

If a fifo full condition is encountered, i/o requests will stack
up in the h->reqQ queue.  The only thing which empties this queue
is start_io, which only gets called when new i/o requests come in.
If none are forthcoming, i/o in h->reqQ will be stalled.

To fix this, whenever fifo full condition is encountered, this
is recorded, and the interrupt handler examines this to see
if a fifo full condition was recently encountered when a
command completes and will call start_io to prevent i/o's in
h->reqQ from getting stuck.

I've only ever seen this problem occur when running specialized
test programs that pound on the the CCISS_PASSTHRU ioctl.
