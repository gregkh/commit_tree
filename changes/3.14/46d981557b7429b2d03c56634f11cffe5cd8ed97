staging: ft1000: STATUS defines completely removed

The ft1000 driver ignores the normal Linux error codes, using its
own macros, STATUS, STATUS_SUCCESS, and STATUS_FAILURE, instead.
Unsigned variables (u16 and u32) are sometimes used to hold them.
This patch converts all occurences of these macros to 0, 0 and -1,
respectively. It also changes the last remaining status variables
(mostly called status and ret) to ints, and removes the declarations
of the macros. This patch does not correct the whitespace issues
in the lines where the changes were made.
