bnx2x: Allow VF rss on higher PFs

bnx2x driver uses incorrect PF identifier to configure (in HW) the VF
interrupt scheme; As a result, in multi-function mode the configuration
for PFs with a high index (4+) will overflow and the PF will erroneously
configure a single ISR scheme for its VFs.
As a result, if such a VF uses multiple queues, interrupt generation will
stop after VF receives an Rx packet or sends a Tx packet on a queue
other than queue[0].
