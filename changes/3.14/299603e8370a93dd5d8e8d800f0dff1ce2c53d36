net-gro: Prepare GRO stack for the upcoming tunneling support

This patch modifies the GRO stack to avoid the use of "network_header"
and associated macros like ip_hdr() and ipv6_hdr() in order to allow
an arbitary number of IP hdrs (v4 or v6) to be used in the
encapsulation chain. This lays the foundation for various IP
tunneling support (IP-in-IP, GRE, VXLAN, SIT,...) to be added later.

With this patch, the GRO stack traversing now is mostly based on
skb_gro_offset rather than special hdr offsets saved in skb (e.g.,
skb->network_header). As a result all but the top layer (i.e., the
the transport layer) must have hdrs of the same length in order for
a pkt to be considered for aggregation. Therefore when adding a new
encap layer (e.g., for tunneling), one must check and skip flows
(e.g., by setting NAPI_GRO_CB(p)->same_flow to 0) that have a
different hdr length.

Note that unlike the network header, the transport header can and
will continue to be set by the GRO code since there will be at
most one "transport layer" in the encap chain.
