usb: dwc2: fix memory corruption in dwc2 driver

The move from the staging tree to the main tree exposed a
longstanding memory corruption bug in the dwc2 driver. The
reordering of the driver initialization caused the dwc2 driver
to corrupt the initialization data of the sdhci driver on the
Raspberry Pi platform, which made the bug show up.

The error is in calling to_usb_device(hsotg->dev), since ->dev
is not a member of struct usb_device. The easiest fix is to
just remove the offending code, since it is not really needed.

Thanks to Stephen Warren for tracking down the cause of this.
