sysfs, kernfs: prepare write path for kernfs

We're in the process of separating out core sysfs functionality into
kernfs which will deal with sysfs_dirents directly.  This patch
rearranges write path so that the kernfs and sysfs parts are separate.

kernfs_file_write() handles all boilerplate work including buffer
management and locking and invokes sysfs_kf_write() or
sysfs_kf_bin_write() depending on the file type which deals with the
interaction with kobj store or bin_attribute write method.

While this patch changes the order of some operations, it shouldn't
change any visible behavior.
