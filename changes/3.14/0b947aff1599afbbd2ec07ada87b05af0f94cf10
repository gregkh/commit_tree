Btrfs: use btrfs_crc32c everywhere instead of libcrc32c

After the commit titled "Btrfs: fix btrfs boot when compiled as built-in",
LIBCRC32C requirement was removed from btrfs' Kconfig. This made it not
possible to build a kernel with btrfs enabled (either as module or built-in)
if libcrc32c is not enabled as well. So just replace all uses of libcrc32c
with the equivalent function in btrfs hash.h - btrfs_crc32c.
