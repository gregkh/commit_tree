i40e: remove and fix confusing define name

I40E_ITR_NONE was being used as an ITRN register index by
accident because it was easily associated with the I40E_RX_ITR
and friends defines.

Change the name slightly in order to make it clear that
I40E_ITR_NONE is really associated with the DYN_CTL register
sets.
