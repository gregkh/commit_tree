cfg80211: Add support for QoS mapping

This allows QoS mapping from external networks to be implemented as
defined in IEEE Std 802.11-2012, 10.24.9. APs can use this to advertise
DSCP ranges and exceptions for mapping frames to a specific UP over
Wi-Fi.

The payload of the QoS Map Set element (IEEE Std 802.11-2012, 8.4.2.97)
is sent to the driver through the new NL80211_ATTR_QOS_MAP attribute to
configure the local behavior either on the AP (based on local
configuration) or on a station (based on information received from the
AP).
