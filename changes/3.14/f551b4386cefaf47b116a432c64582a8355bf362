i40e: fix pf reset after offline test

When the ethtool testing starts it sets the I40E_TESTING state
bit, which blocks new netdev opens so that things don't get
confused, while the testing might be messing with register and
other things.  Unfortunately, that was keeping the PF resets
after the register test from working correctly because the netdev
would not get reopened.  This patch reorders the tests to put the
register test last as it is the only one that needs a reset, and
we wait to trigger the reset until after we clear the
I40E_TESTING bit.
