iser-target: Ignore completions for FRWRs in isert_cq_tx_work

This patch changes IB_WR_FAST_REG_MR + IB_WR_LOCAL_INV related
work requests to include a ISER_FRWR_LI_WRID value in order to
signal isert_cq_tx_work() that these requests should be ignored.

This is necessary because even though IB_SEND_SIGNALED is not
set for either work request, during a QP failure event the work
requests will be returned with exception status from the TX
completion queue.

v2 changes:
 - Rename ISER_FRWR_LI_WRID -> ISER_FASTREG_LI_WRID (Sagi)
