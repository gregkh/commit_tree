Bluetooth: Add module parameter to enable LE CoC support

Along with the L2CAP Connection Oriented Channels features it is now
allowed to use both custom fixed CIDs as well as PSM based (connection
oriented connections). Since the support for this (with the subsequent
patches) is still on an experimental stage, add a module parameter to
enable it.
