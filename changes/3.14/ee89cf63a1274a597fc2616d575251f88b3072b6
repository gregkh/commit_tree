gpio: introduce GPIO_DAVINCI kconfig option

The compatible to Davinci GPIO HW block is used by other TI SoCs, like
Keystone, where GPIO support is declared as optional.

Hence, introduce GPIO_DAVINCI Kconfig option which will allow to enable
Davinci GPIO driver for Keystone SoCs when needed. At same time, kept
Davinci GPIO driver enabled for Davinci SoCs by default.
