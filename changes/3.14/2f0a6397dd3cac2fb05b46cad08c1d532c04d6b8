KVM: VMX: check use I/O bitmap first before unconditional I/O exit

According to Table C-1 of Intel SDM 3C, a VM exit happens on an I/O instruction when
"use I/O bitmaps" VM-execution control was 0 _and_ the "unconditional I/O exiting"
VM-execution control was 1. So we can't just check "unconditional I/O exiting" alone.
This patch was improved by suggestion from Jan Kiszka.
