HID: add support for Logitech Dual Action gamepads

I have two Logitech Dual Action gamepads, both have same Vendor/Device id pair.
Newest gamepad (A) can switch between old mode (HID) and XBox gamepad emulation
mode. Old gamepad (B) can only work in HID mode.  In HID mode gamepad A sends
many EPIPE errors during initialization and was disconnected immediately after
connect  to usb port. It works fine in Win and Mac. After adding NOGET quirk in
driver, it was working properly.  Gamepad B works fine before and after
changes. I tested both gamepads with 3.8.0 and 3.11.6 kernels  with modified
driver. Follow patch can apply for current git kernel version. I can send pcap
log from usb bus with both gamepads or any other additional information if it
is needed
