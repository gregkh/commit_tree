Btrfs: fix protection between send and root deletion

We should gurantee that parent and clone roots can not be destroyed
during send, for this we have two ideas.

1.by holding @subvol_sem, this might be a nightmare, because it will
block all subvolumes deletion for a long time.

2.Miao pointed out we can reuse @send_in_progress, that mean we will
skip snapshot deletion if root sending is in progress.

Here we adopt the second approach since it won't block other subvolumes
deletion for a long time.

Besides in btrfs_clean_one_deleted_snapshot(), we only check first root
, if this root is involved in send, we return directly rather than
continue to check.There are several reasons about it:

1.this case happen seldomly.
2.after sending,cleaner thread can continue to drop that root.
3.make code simple
