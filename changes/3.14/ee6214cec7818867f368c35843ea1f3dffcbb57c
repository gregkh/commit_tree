arm64: support single-step and breakpoint handler hooks

AArch64 Single Steping and Breakpoint debug exceptions will be
used by multiple debug framworks like kprobes & kgdb.

This patch implements the hooks for those frameworks to register
their own handlers for handling breakpoint and single step events.

Reworked the debug exception handler in entry.S: do_dbg to route
software breakpoint (BRK64) exception to do_debug_exception()
