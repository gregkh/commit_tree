sched/deadline: Remove unused variables

fix these new sparse warnings:

  >> kernel/sched/core.c:305:14: sparse: symbol 'sysctl_sched_dl_period' was not declared. Should it be static?
  >> kernel/sched/core.c:306:5: sparse: symbol 'sysctl_sched_dl_runtime' was not declared. Should it be static?

Better still, they're completely unused so remove them.
