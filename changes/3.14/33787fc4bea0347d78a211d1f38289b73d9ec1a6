mac80211: move csa_chandef to sdata

There is no reason why we should have only one channel switch
announcement at a time for a single phy.  When support for channel
switch with multiple contexts and multiple vifs per context is
implemented, we will need the chandef data for each vif.  Move the
csa_chandef structure to sdata to prepare for this.
