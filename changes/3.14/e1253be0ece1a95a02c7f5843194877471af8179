NFSv4: nfs4_stateid_is_current should return 'true' for an invalid stateid

When nfs4_set_rw_stateid() can fails by returning EIO to indicate that
the stateid is completely invalid, then it makes no sense to have it
trigger a retry of the READ or WRITE operation. Instead, we should just
have it fall through and attempt a recovery.

This fixes an infinite loop in which the client keeps replaying the same
bad stateid back to the server.
