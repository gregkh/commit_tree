kernfs: implement "trusted.*" xattr support

kernfs inherited "security.*" xattr support from sysfs.  This patch
extends xattr support to "trusted.*" using simple_xattr_*().  As
trusted xattrs are restricted to CAP_SYS_ADMIN, simple_xattr_*() which
uses kernel memory for storage shouldn't be problematic.

Note that the existing "security.*" support doesn't implement
get/remove/list and the this patch only implements those ops for
"trusted.*".  We probably want to extend those ops to include support
for "security.*".

This patch will allow using kernfs from cgroup which requires
"trusted.*" xattr support.
