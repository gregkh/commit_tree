drm/panel: Add simple panel support

Add a driver for simple panels. Such panels can have a regulator that
provides the supply voltage and a separate GPIO to enable the panel.
Optionally the panels can have a backlight associated with them so it
can be enabled or disabled according to the panel's power management
mode.

Support is added for two panels: An AU Optronics 10.1" WSVGA and a
Chunghwa Picture Tubes 10.1" WXGA panel.
