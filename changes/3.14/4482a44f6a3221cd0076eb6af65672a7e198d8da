Smack: File receive audit correction

Eric Paris politely points out:

    Inside smack_file_receive() it seems like you are initting the audit
    field with LSM_AUDIT_DATA_TASK.  And then use
    smk_ad_setfield_u_fs_path().

    Seems like LSM_AUDIT_DATA_PATH would make more sense.  (and depending
    on how it's used fix a crash...)

He is correct. This puts things in order.
