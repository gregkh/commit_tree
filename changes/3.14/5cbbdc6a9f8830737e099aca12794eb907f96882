mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Use extended cmdfunc() only if needed

Currently, we have two different cmdfunc's implementations:
one for PXA3xx SoC variant and one for Armada 370/XP SoC variant.

The former is the legacy one, typically constrained to devices
with page sizes smaller or equal to the controller's FIFO buffer.
On the other side, the latter _only_ supports the so-called extended
command semantics, which allow to handle devices with larger
page sizes (4 KiB, 8 KiB, ...).

This means we currently don't support devices with smaller pages on the
A370/XP SoC. Fix it by first renaming the cmdfuncs variants, and then
make the choice based on device page size (and SoC variant), rather than
SoC variant alone.

While at it, add a check for page size, to make sure we don't allow larger
pages sizes on the PXA3xx variant.
