mm/memblock: debug: correct displaying of upper memory boundary

Current memblock APIs don't work on 32 PAE or LPAE extension arches
where the physical memory start address beyond 4GB.  The problem was
discussed here [3] where Tejun, Yinghai(thanks) proposed a way forward
with memblock interfaces.  Based on the proposal, this series adds
necessary memblock interfaces and convert the core kernel code to use
them.  Architectures already converted to NO_BOOTMEM use these new
interfaces and other which still uses bootmem, these new interfaces just
fallback to exiting bootmem APIs.

So no functional change in behavior.  In long run, once all the
architectures moves to NO_BOOTMEM, we can get rid of bootmem layer
completely.  This is one step to remove the core code dependency with
bootmem and also gives path for architectures to move away from bootmem.

Testing is done on ARM architecture with 32 bit ARM LAPE machines with
normal as well sparse(faked) memory model.

This patch (of 23):

When debugging is enabled (cmdline has "memblock=debug") the memblock
will display upper memory boundary per each allocated/freed memory range
wrongly.  For example:

 memblock_reserve: [0x0000009e7e8000-0x0000009e7ed000] _memblock_early_alloc_try_nid_nopanic+0xfc/0x12c

The 0x0000009e7ed000 is displayed instead of 0x0000009e7ecfff

Hence, correct this by changing formula used to calculate upper memory
boundary to (u64)base + size - 1 instead of (u64)base + size everywhere
in the debug messages.
