USB: OHCI: Properly handle ohci-da8xx suspend

Suspend scenario in case of ohci-da8xx glue was not
properly handled as it was not suspending generic part
of ohci controller. Alan Stern suggested, properly handle
ohci-da8xx suspend scenario.

Calling explicitly the ohci_suspend()
routine in ohci_da8xx_suspend() will ensure proper
handling of suspend scenario.
