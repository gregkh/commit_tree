mfd: Add LP3943 MFD driver

LP3943 has 16 output pins which can be used as GPIO expander and PWM generator.

* Regmap I2C interface for R/W LP3943 registers

* Atomic operations for output pin assignment
  The driver should check whether requested pin is available or not.
  If the pin is already used, pin request returns as a failure.
  A driver data, 'pin_used' is checked when gpio_request() and
  pwm_request() are called. If the pin is available, then pin_used is set.
  And it is cleared when gpio_free() and pwm_free().

* Device tree support
  Compatible strings for GPIO and PWM driver.
  LP3943 platform data is PWM related, so parsing the device tree is
  implemented in the PWM driver.
