genirq: Add an accessor for IRQ_PER_CPU flag

This patch adds an accessor function for IRQ_PER_CPU flag.
The accessor function is useful to determine whether an IRQ is percpu or not.

This patch is based on an older patch posted by Chris Smith here [1].
There is a minor change w.r.t. Chris's original patch: The accessor function
is renamed as 'irq_is_percpu' instead of 'irq_is_per_cpu'.
