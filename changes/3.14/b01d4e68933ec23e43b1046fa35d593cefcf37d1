x86: fix compile error due to X86_TRAP_NMI use in asm files

It's an enum, not a #define, you can't use it in asm files.

Introduced in commit 5fa10196bdb5 ("x86: Ignore NMIs that come in during
early boot"), and sadly I didn't compile-test things like I should have
before pushing out.

My weak excuse is that the x86 tree generally doesn't introduce stupid
things like this (and the ARM pull afterwards doesn't cause me to do a
compile-test either, since I don't cross-compile).
