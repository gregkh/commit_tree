vfio-pci: Don't use device_lock around AER interrupt setup

device_lock is much too prone to lockups.  For instance if we have a
pending .remove then device_lock is already held.  If userspace
attempts to modify AER signaling after that point, a deadlock occurs.
eventfd setup/teardown is already protected in vfio with the igate
mutex.  AER is not a high performance interrupt, so we can also use
the same mutex to protect signaling versus setup races.
