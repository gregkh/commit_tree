ipv6: ipv6_find_hdr restore prev functionality

The commit 9195bb8e381d81d5a315f911904cdf0cfcc919b8 ("ipv6: improve
ipv6_find_hdr() to skip empty routing headers") broke ipv6_find_hdr().

When a target is specified like IPPROTO_ICMPV6 ipv6_find_hdr()
returns -ENOENT when it's found, not the header as expected.

A part of IPVS is broken and possible also nft_exthdr_eval().
When target is -1 which it is most cases, it works.

This patch exits the do while loop if the specific header is found
so the nexthdr could be returned as expected.
