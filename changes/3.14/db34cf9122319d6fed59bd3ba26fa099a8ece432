crypto: ccp - CCP device enabled/disabled changes

The CCP cannot be hot-plugged so it will either be there
or it won't.  Do not allow the driver to stay loaded if the
CCP does not successfully initialize.

Provide stub routines in the ccp.h file that return -ENODEV
if the CCP has not been configured in the build.
