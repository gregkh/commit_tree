staging/lustre/server: use unified request handler for MGS

- Unify request handler. It finds target for particular request and
  calls appropriate handler for it. Generic handlers are moved to
  the unified target code. The tgt_session_info is introduced to
  store all request-related data and passed to all handlers.
- Pack reply in llog server functions early and use err_serious()
- remove obsoleted llog_origin_handle_cancel(), it is not used
  anymore
- remove push_ctxt/pop_ctxt from llog server function, it is based
  on OSD now.
