arch/x86/mm/srat: Skip NUMA_NO_NODE while parsing SLIT

When ACPI SLIT table has an I/O locality (i.e. a locality
unique to an I/O device), numa_set_distance() emits this warning
message:

 NUMA: Warning: node ids are out of bound, from=-1 to=-1 distance=10

acpi_numa_slit_init() calls numa_set_distance() with
pxm_to_node(), which assumes that all localities have been
parsed with SRAT previously.  SRAT does not list I/O localities,
where as SLIT lists all localities including I/Os.  Hence,
pxm_to_node() returns NUMA_NO_NODE (-1) for an I/O locality.

I/O localities are not supported and are ignored today, but emitting
such warning message leads to unnecessary confusion.

Change acpi_numa_slit_init() to avoid calling
numa_set_distance() with NUMA_NO_NODE.
