ext4: don't try to modify s_flags if the the file system is read-only

If an ext4 file system is created by some tool other than mke2fs
(perhaps by someone who has a pathalogical fear of the GPL) that
doesn't set one or the other of the EXT2_FLAGS_{UN}SIGNED_HASH flags,
and that file system is then mounted read-only, don't try to modify
the s_flags field.  Otherwise, if dm_verity is in use, the superblock
will change, causing an dm_verity failure.
