tun: Add support for RFS on tun flows

This patch adds support so that the rps_flow_tables (RFS) can be
programmed using the tun flows which are already set up to track flows
for the purposes of queue selection.

On the receive path (corresponding to select_queue and tun_net_xmit) the
rxhash is saved in the flow_entry.  The original code only does flow
lookup in select_queue, so this patch adds a flow lookup in tun_net_xmit
if num_queues == 1 (select_queue is not called from
dev_queue_xmit->netdev_pick_tx in that case).

The flow is recorded (processing CPU) in tun_flow_update (TX path), and
reset when flow is deleted.
