net/mlx4_en: Add netdev support for TCP/IP offloads of vxlan tunneling

When the device tunneling offloads mode is vxlan do the following

 - call SET_PORT with the relevant setting

 - add DMFS steering vxlan rule for the device self and multicast mac addresses
   of the form: {<ETH, outer-mac> <VXLAN, ANY vnid> <ETH, ANY mac>} --> RSS QP

 - set relevant QPC fields in RSS context and RX ring QPs

 - in TX flow, set WQE fields to generate HW checksum, and handle gso skbs
   which are marked for encapsulation such that the HW will segment them properly.

 - in RX flow, read HW offloaded checksum for encapsulated packets from the CQE

 - advertize hw_enc_features and NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL to the networking stack
