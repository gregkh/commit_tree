staging/lustre/ldlm: fix resource/fid check, use DLDLMRES

In ll_md_blocking_ast() the FID/resource comparison is incorrectly
checking for fid_ver() stored in res_id.name[2] instead of name[1]
changed since http://review.whamcloud.com/2271 (commit 4f91d5161d00)
landed.  This does not impact current clients, since name[2] and
fid_ver() are always zero, but it could cause problems in the future.

In ldlm_cli_enqueue_fini() use ldlm_res_eq() instead of comparing
each of the resource fields separately.

Use DLDLMRES/PLDLMRES when printing resource names everywhere.
