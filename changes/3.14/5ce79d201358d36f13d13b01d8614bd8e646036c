PCI / ACPI: Use acpi_find_child_device() for child devices lookup

It is much more efficient to use acpi_find_child_device()
for child devices lookup in acpi_pci_find_device() and pass
ACPI_COMPANION(dev->parent) to it directly instead of obtaining
ACPI_HANDLE() of ACPI_COMPANION(dev->parent) and passing it to
acpi_find_child() which has to run acpi_bus_get_device() to
obtain ACPI_COMPANION(dev->parent) from that again.
