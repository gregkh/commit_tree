pseries/cpuidle: Remove redundant call to ppc64_runlatch_off() in cpu idle routines

Commit fbd7740fdfdf9475f(powerpc: Simplify pSeries idle loop) switched pseries cpu
idle handling from complete idle loops to ppc_md.powersave functions. Earlier to
this switch, ppc64_runlatch_off() had to be called in each of the idle routines.
But after the switch, this call is handled in arch_cpu_idle(),just before the call
to ppc_md.powersave, where platform specific idle routines are called.

As a consequence, the call to ppc64_runlatch_off() got duplicated in the
arch_cpu_idle() routine as well as in the some of the idle routines in
pseries and commit fbd7740fdfdf9475f missed to get rid of these redundant
calls. These calls were carried over subsequent enhancements to the pseries
cpuidle routines.

Although multiple calls to ppc64_runlatch_off() is harmless, there is still some
overhead due to it. Besides that, these calls could also make way for a
misunderstanding that it is *necessary* to call ppc64_runlatch_off() multiple
times, when that is not the case. Hence this patch takes care of eliminating
this redundancy.
