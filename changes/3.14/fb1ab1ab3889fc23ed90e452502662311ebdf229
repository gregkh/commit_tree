arm64: kernel: implement fpsimd CPU PM notifier

When a CPU enters a low power state, its FP register content is lost.
This patch adds a notifier to save the FP context on CPU shutdown
and restore it on CPU resume. The context is saved and restored only
if the suspending thread is not a kernel thread, mirroring the current
context switch behaviour.
