Fix mountpoint reference leakage in linkat

Recent changes to retry on ESTALE in linkat
(commit 442e31ca5a49e398351b2954b51f578353fdf210)
introduced a mountpoint reference leak and a small memory
leak in case a filesystem link operation returns ESTALE
which is pretty normal for distributed filesystems like
lustre, nfs and so on.
Free old_path in such a case.

[AV: there was another missing path_put() nearby - on the previous
goto retry]
