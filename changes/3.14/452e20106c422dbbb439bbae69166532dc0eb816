drivers: target: Mark function as static in target_core_iblock.c

Mark function iblock_get_write_cache() as static in target_core_iblock.c
because it is not used outside this file.

This eliminates the following warning in target_core_iblock.c:
drivers/target/target_core_iblock.c:766:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘iblock_get_write_cache’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
