m68k/amiga,atari: Fix specifying multiple debug= parameters

Since commit d6713b4091a99fa2af2fabdcd2f3fb97f32ecf2e ("m68k: early
parameter support"), the user can specify multiple debug consoles using the
"debug=" kernel command line parameter.
However, as there's only a single struct console object, which is reused,
it would actually register the same console object multiple times, causing
the following warning:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/printk/printk.c:2233 register_console+0x36/
console 'debug0' already registered

Make sure to register the console object only once, to avoid the warning.

Note that still only one console (the one corresponding to the last
"debug=" parameter) will be active at the same time, as the .write() method
of the already registered console object is overwritten by a subsequent
"debug=" parameter.
