audit: correct a type mismatch in audit_syscall_exit()

audit_syscall_exit() saves a result of regs_return_value() in intermediate
"int" variable and passes it to __audit_syscall_exit(), which expects its
second argument as a "long" value.  This will result in truncating the
value returned by a system call and making a wrong audit record.

I don't know why gcc compiler doesn't complain about this, but anyway it
causes a problem at runtime on arm64 (and probably most 64-bit archs).
