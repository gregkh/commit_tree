[media] v4l: omap4iss: use snprintf() to make smatch happy

Smatch complains here because name is a 32 character buffer and we
adding the "OMAP4 ISS " prefix as well for a total of 42 characters.
The sd->name buffer can only hold 32 characters.  I've changed it to use
snprintf() to silence the overflow warning.

Also I have removed the call to strlcpy() which is a no-op.
