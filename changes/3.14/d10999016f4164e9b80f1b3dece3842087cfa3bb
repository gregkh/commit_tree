vfio: Convert control interface to misc driver

This change allows us to support module auto loading using devname
support in userspace tools.  With this, /dev/vfio/vfio will always
be present and opening it will cause the vfio module to load.  This
should avoid needing to configure the system to statically load
vfio in order to get libvirt to correctly detect support for it.
