Btrfs: move the extent buffer radix tree into the fs_info

I need to create a fake tree to test qgroups and I don't want to have to setup a
fake btree_inode.  The fact is we only use the radix tree for the fs_info, so
everybody else who allocates an extent_io_tree is just wasting the space anyway.
This patch moves the radix tree and its lock into btrfs_fs_info so there is less
stuff I have to fake to do qgroup sanity tests.  Thanks,
