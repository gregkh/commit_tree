ocfs2: pass ocfs2_cluster_connection to ocfs2_this_node

This is done to differentiate between using and not using controld and
use the connection information accordingly.

We need to be backward compatible.  So, we use a new enum
ocfs2_connection_type to identify when controld is used and when it is
not.
