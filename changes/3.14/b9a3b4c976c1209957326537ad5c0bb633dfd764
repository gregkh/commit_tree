mm, x86: Revisit tlb_flushall_shift tuning for page flushes except on IvyBridge

There was a large ebizzy performance regression that was
bisected to commit 611ae8e3 (x86/tlb: enable tlb flush range
support for x86).  The problem was related to the
tlb_flushall_shift tuning for IvyBridge which was altered.  The
problem is that it is not clear if the tuning values for each
CPU family is correct as the methodology used to tune the values
is unclear.

This patch uses a conservative tlb_flushall_shift value for all
CPU families except IvyBridge so the decision can be revisited
if any regression is found as a result of this change.
IvyBridge is an exception as testing with one methodology
determined that the value of 2 is acceptable.  Details are in
the changelog for the patch "x86: mm: Change tlb_flushall_shift
for IvyBridge".

One important aspect of this to watch out for is Xen.  The
original commit log mentioned large performance gains on Xen.
It's possible Xen is more sensitive to this value if it flushes
small ranges of pages more frequently than workloads on bare
metal typically do.
