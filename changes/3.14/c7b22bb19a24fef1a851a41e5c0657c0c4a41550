btrfs: fix missing increment of bi_remaining

In btrfs_end_bio(), we increment bi_remaining if is_orig_bio. If not,
we restore the orig_bio but failed to increment bi_remaining for
orig_bio, which triggers a BUG_ON later when bio_endio is called. Fix
is to increment bi_remaining when we restore the orig bio as well.
