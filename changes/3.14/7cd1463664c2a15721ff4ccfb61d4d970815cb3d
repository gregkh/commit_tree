net: mv643xx_eth: use phy_init_hw to reset PHY

Instead of open-coding a PHY reset through the MII BMCR register, use
phy_init_hw() which does that for us and will also make sure that PHY
fixups are applied if required. We also remove a call to phy_reset()
due to the following sequence of calls in the driver:

phy_scan()
	-> phy_connect()
		-> phy_connect_direct()
			-> phy_attach_direct()
				-> phy_init_hw()

and we only have a call to phy_init() after phy_scan().
