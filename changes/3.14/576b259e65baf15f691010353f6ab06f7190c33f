drm/i915: use crtc_htotal when calculating ilk watermarks

This was introduced in:

    drm/i915: Don't re-compute pipe watermarks except for the affected pipe

and I missed fixing it in:

    drm/i915: use crtc_htotal in watermark calculations to match fastboot v2

It's needed for ILK+ platforms to fastboot without crashing on a divide
by 0 after a DPMS on action.

Note: Ville mentioned in his review that this confusion seems to go
down to the original introduction of this code in

commit 801bcfffbb0721d7131e930f9a46103e539c43a4

    drm/i915: properly set HSW WM_PIPE registers

So it seems to have been missed both in the fastboot patch and in the
3d mode suppport (where only crtc_htotal reflects the real pipe
width).
