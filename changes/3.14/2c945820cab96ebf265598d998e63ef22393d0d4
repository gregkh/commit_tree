dm snapshot: fix metadata corruption

Commit 55494bf2947dccdf2 ("dm snapshot: use dm-bufio") broke snapshots.
Before that 3.14-rc1 commit, loading a snapshot's list of exceptions
involved reading exception areas one by one into ps->area and inserting
those exceptions into the hash table.  Commit 55494bf2947dccdf2 changed
it so that dm-bufio with prefetch is used to load exceptions in batchs.
Exceptions are loaded correctly, but ps->area is left uninitialized.
When a new exception is allocated, it is stored in this uninitialized
ps->area which will be written to the disk.  This causes metadata
corruption.

Fix this corruption by copying the last area that was read via dm-bufio
into ps->area.
