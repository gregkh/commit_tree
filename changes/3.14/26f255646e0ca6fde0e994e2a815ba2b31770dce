tracing/README: Add event file usage to tracing mini-HOWTO

It would be useful to have a cheat-sheet for everything under
tracing/events/ alongside the existing text describing the other files
in the tracing/ dir.

Add short descriptions of the directories and files under events/
along with examples, similar to the existing text for the other files
in tracing/.

Also clean up a few minor alignment problems noticed when adding the
new text.
