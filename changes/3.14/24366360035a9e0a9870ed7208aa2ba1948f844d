powerpc/powernv: Infrastructure to read opal messages in generic format.

Opal now has a new messaging infrastructure to push the messages to
linux in a generic format for different type of messages using only one
event bit. The format of the opal message is as below:

struct opal_msg {
        uint32_t msg_type;
	uint32_t reserved;
	uint64_t params[8];
};

This patch allows clients to subscribe for notification for specific
message type. It is upto the subscriber to decipher the messages who showed
interested in receiving specific message type.

The interface to subscribe for notification is:

	int opal_message_notifier_register(enum OpalMessageType msg_type,
                                        struct notifier_block *nb)

The notifier will fetch the opal message when available and notify the
subscriber with message type and the opal message. It is subscribers
responsibility to copy the message data before returning from notifier
callback.
