kernfs: s/sysfs/kernfs/ in internal functions and whatever is left

kernfs has just been separated out from sysfs and we're already in
full conflict mode.  Nothing can make the situation any worse.  Let's
take the chance to name things properly.

This patch performs the following renames.

* s/sysfs_*()/kernfs_*()/ in all internal functions
* s/sysfs/kernfs/ in internal strings, comments and whatever is remaining
* Uniformly rename various vfs operations so that they're consistently
  named and distinguishable.

This patch is strictly rename only and doesn't introduce any
functional difference.
