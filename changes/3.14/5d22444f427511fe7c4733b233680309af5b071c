cgroup: generalize cgroup_pidlist_open_file

In preparation of conversion to kernfs, cgroup file handling is
updated so that it can be easily mapped to kernfs.  This patch renames
cgroup_pidlist_open_file to cgroup_open_file and updates it so that it
only contains a field to identify the specific file, ->cfe, and an
opaque ->priv pointer.  When cgroup is converted to kernfs, this will
be replaced by kernfs_open_file which contains about the same
information.

As whether the file is "cgroup.procs" or "tasks" should now be
determined from cgroup_open_file->cfe, the cftype->private for the two
files now carry the file type and cgroup_pidlist_start() reads the
type through cfe->type->private.  This makes the distinction between
cgroup_tasks_open() and cgroup_procs_open() unnecessary.
cgroup_pidlist_open() is now directly used as the open method.

This patch doesn't make any behavior changes.

v2: Refreshed on top of the updated "cgroup: introduce struct
    cgroup_pidlist_open_file".
