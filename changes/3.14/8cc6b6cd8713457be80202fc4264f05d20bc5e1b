powerpc/eeh: Drop taken reference to driver on eeh_rmv_device

Commit f5c57710dd62dd06f176934a8b4b8accbf00f9f8 ("powerpc/eeh: Use
partial hotplug for EEH unaware drivers") introduces eeh_rmv_device,
which may grab a reference to a driver, but not release it.

That prevents a driver from being removed after it has gone through EEH
recovery.

This patch drops the reference if it was taken.
