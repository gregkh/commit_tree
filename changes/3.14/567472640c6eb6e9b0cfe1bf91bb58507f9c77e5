i40e: Do not enable default port on the VEB

Enabling the default port on the VEB causes all outgoing traffic from
virtual functions to be copied to the physical function.  The default
port is only supposed to be used if you wish to bridge the physical
function to a SW switch such as Open vSwitch or the Linux bridge. That
allows the SW switch to route traffic to VMs that are not using a
virtual function.

Eventually we'll want to implement the ndo_fdb_add, ndo_fdb_del, and
ndo_fdb_dump functions.  The ndo_fdb_add function would set the
default port on the VEB in those cases where the MAC/VLAN address
filters have overflowed.  Normally we would not want to use it.
