SFI / ACPI: Fix warnings reported during builds with W=1

The following warnings can be seen in W=1 builds, because the original
sfi_acpi.[ch] header inclusions are incorrect:

include/linux/sfi_acpi.h:72:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'acpi_table_parse' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
drivers/sfi/sfi_acpi.c:154:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'sfi_acpi_table_parse' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

Fix linux/sfi_acpi.h and modify drivers/sfi/sfi_acpi.c accordingly.
