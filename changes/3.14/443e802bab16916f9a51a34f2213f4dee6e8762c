s390/cpum_sf: Detect KVM guest samples

The host-program-parameter (hpp) value of basic sample-data-entries designates
a SIE control block that is set by the LPP instruction in sie64a().
Non-zero values indicate guest samples, a value of zero indicates a host sample.

For perf samples, host and guest samples are distinguished using particular
PERF_MISC_* flags.  The perf layer calls perf_misc_flags() to set the flags
based on the pt_regs content.  For each sample-data-entry, the cpum_sf PMU
creates a pt_regs structure with the sample-data information.  An additional
flag structure is added to easily distinguish between host and guest samples.
