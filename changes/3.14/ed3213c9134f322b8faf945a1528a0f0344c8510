wl1251: fix channel switching in monitor mode

Use the ENABLE_RX command for channel switching when no interface is present
(monitor mode only).
The advantage of ENABLE_RX is that it leaves the tx data path disabled in
firmware, whereas the usual JOIN command seems to transmit some frames at
firmware level.
