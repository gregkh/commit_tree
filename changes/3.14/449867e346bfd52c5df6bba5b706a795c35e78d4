perf symbols: Fix not finding kcore in buildid cache

The logic was not looking in the buildid cache for kcore if the host
kernel buildid did not match the recorded kernel buildid.

This affects the non-live case i.e. the kernel has changed and we are
looking at a special copy of kcore that we placed in the buildid cache
(using "perf buildid-cache -v -k /proc/kcore") when the data was
recorded.

After this fix kernel symbols get resolved/annotated correctly.
