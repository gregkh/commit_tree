staging:wlan-ng:hfa384x.h: remove typedef struct hfa384x_bytestr __packed hfa384x_bytestr_t

This patch removes the checkpatch.pl warning "do not add new typedefs"
and changes all source files that use that typedef. Also lines were
shortened to 80 characters to do away with the checkpatch.pl warning
"line over 80 characters" generated due to replacement of the
hfa384x_bytestr_t by struct hfa384x_bytestr in prism2mgmt.c,
prism2mgmt.h, prism2mib.c, prism2sta.c.
