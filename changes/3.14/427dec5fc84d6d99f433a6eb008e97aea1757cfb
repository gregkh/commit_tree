brcmfmac: move wiphy_unregister() call to brcmf_cfg80211_detach()

The wiphy_unregister() call was done in brcmf_free_vif() when the
last interface was being removed. This is not the obvious place to
do that. This patch moves it to the brcmf_cfg80211_detach(). This
removes the need to keep count of interfaces.
