staging: ft1000: STATUS_ defines removed from ft1000_download.c

Two files in the ft1000 usb driver ignore expected Linux error codes,
and instead use two STATUS_SUCCESS 0, and STATUS_FAILURE
0x1001. This patch removes all remaining occurrences of these from the
file ft1000_download.c. All occurrences of STATUS_SUCCESS have been
replaced by 0, and occurrences of STATUS_FAILURE have been replaced by
-1. One occurence of STATUS_FAILURE has been completely removed:
get_handshake collects either a local #define or 0 from its helper
function, check_usb_db, and immediately sets the collecting variable to
STATUS_FAILURE if the #define is returned. check_usb_db has been
modified to return -1 instead of the #define.
