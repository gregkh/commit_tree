splice: fix unexpected size truncation

@splice_desc.total_len is 32 bit(unsigned int) which is used to store the
size passed from userspace which is 64 bit(size_t) so that the size is
unexpectedly truncated

That means vmsplice can not work if the size passed from userspace is >=
4G, for example, we noticed in vmsplice, splice-reader does not do
anything and splice-writer is waiting for available buffer forever if the
size is 4G

Fix it by extending @splice_desc.total_len to 64 bits as well
