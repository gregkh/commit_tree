bcma: gpio: add own IRQ domain

Input GPIO changes can generate interrupts, but we need kind of ACK for
them by changing IRQ polarity. This is required to stop hardware from
keep generating interrupts and generate another one on the next GPIO
state change.
This code allows using GPIOs with standard interrupts and add for
example GPIO buttons support.
