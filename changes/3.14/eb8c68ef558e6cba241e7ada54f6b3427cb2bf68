acpi-cpufreq: De-register CPU notifier and free struct msr on error.

If cpufreq_register_driver() fails we would free the acpi driver
related structures but not free the ones allocated
by acpi_cpufreq_boost_init() function. This meant that as
the driver error-ed out and a CPU online/offline event came
we would crash and burn as one of the CPU notifiers would point
to garbage.
