s390/cpum_sf: Dynamically extend the sampling buffer if overflows occur

Improve the sampling buffer allocation and add a function to reallocate and
increase the sampling buffer structure.  The number of allocated buffer elements
(sample-data-blocks) are accounted.  You can control the minimum and maximum
number these sample-data-blocks through the cpum_sfb_size kernel parameter.

The number hardware sample overflows (if any) are also accounted and stored
per perf event.  During the PMU disable/enable calls, the accumulated overflow
counter is analyzed and, if necessary, the sampling buffer is dynamically
increased.
