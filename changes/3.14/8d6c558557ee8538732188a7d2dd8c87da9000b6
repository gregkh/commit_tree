staging: ft1000: fix remaining checkpatch issues in ft1000_hw.c

The file ft1000_hw.c is still full of coding style problems that make it
challenging to read and understand. The lines inside the switch cases
in ft1000_proc_drvmsg() are indented too deeply, so remove one leading
tab. Join lines that are now able to fit in the 80 character limit.
This will take care of the "too many leading tabs" issue. Run
checkpatch.pl on the file, and correct all other issues it reports
(except lines with user visible strings over 80 chars).
