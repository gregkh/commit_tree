powerpc/fsl_booke: make sure PAGE_OFFSET map to memstart_addr for relocatable kernel

This is always true for a non-relocatable kernel. Otherwise the kernel
would get stuck. But for a relocatable kernel, it seems a little
complicated. When booting a relocatable kernel, we just align the
kernel start addr to 64M and map the PAGE_OFFSET from there. The
relocation will base on this virtual address. But if this address
is not the same as the memstart_addr, we will have to change the
map of PAGE_OFFSET to the real memstart_addr and do another relocation
again.
