Btrfs: fix to search previous metadata extent item since skinny metadata

There is a bug that using btrfs_previous_item() to search metadata extent item.
This is because in btrfs_previous_item(), we need type match, however, since
skinny metada was introduced by josef, we may mix this two types. So just
use btrfs_previous_item() is not working right.

To keep btrfs_previous_item() like normal tree search, i introduce another
function btrfs_previous_extent_item().
