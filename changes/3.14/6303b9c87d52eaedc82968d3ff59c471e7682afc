rcu: Apply smp_mb__after_unlock_lock() to preserve grace periods

RCU must ensure that there is the equivalent of a full memory
barrier between any memory access preceding grace period and any
memory access following that same grace period, regardless of
which CPU(s) happen to execute the two memory accesses.
Therefore, downgrading UNLOCK+LOCK to no longer imply a full
memory barrier requires some adjustments to RCU.

This commit therefore adds smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()
invocations as needed after the RCU lock acquisitions that need
to be part of a full-memory-barrier UNLOCK+LOCK.
