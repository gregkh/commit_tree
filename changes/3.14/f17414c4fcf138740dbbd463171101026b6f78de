    spi/qspi: set correct platform drvdata in ti_qspi_probe()

    The ti_qspi_remove() use the platform drvdata as a type of
    struct ti_qspi, we should pass correct platform drvdata to
    platform_set_drvdata() in ti_qspi_probe().

platform_set_drvdata was changed in  the probe, so we need to
correspondingly change deferencing of qspi in runtime resume
path. Else, this will lead to a NULL dereference pointer.

Based on v3.13-rc3
