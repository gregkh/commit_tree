gpiolib: return -ENOENT if no GPIO mapping exists

Some devices drivers make use of optional GPIO parameters. For such
drivers, it is important to discriminate between the case where no
GPIO mapping has been defined for the function they are requesting, and
the case where a mapping exists but an error occured while resolving it
or when acquiring the GPIO.

This patch changes the family of gpiod_get() functions such that they
will return -ENOENT if and only if no GPIO mapping is defined for the
requested function. Other error codes are used when an actual error
occured during the GPIO resolution.
