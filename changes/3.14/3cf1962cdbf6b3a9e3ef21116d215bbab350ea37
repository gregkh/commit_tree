sched,numa: add cond_resched to task_numa_work

Normally task_numa_work scans over a fairly small amount of memory,
but it is possible to run into a large unpopulated part of virtual
memory, with no pages mapped. In that case, task_numa_work can run
for a while, and it may make sense to reschedule as required.
