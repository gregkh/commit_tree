drm: provide a helper for the encoder possible_crtcs mask

The encoder possible_crtcs mask identifies which CRTCs can be bound to
a particular encoder.  Each bit from bit 0 defines an index in the list
of CRTCs held in the DRM mode_config crtc_list.  Rather than having
drivers trying to track the position of their CRTCs in the list, expose
the code which already exists for calculating the appropriate mask bit
for a CRTC.
