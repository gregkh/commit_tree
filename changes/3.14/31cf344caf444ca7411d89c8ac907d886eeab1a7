r6040: use ETH_ZLEN instead of MISR for SKB length checking

Ever since this driver was merged the following code was included:

if (skb->len < MISR)
	skb->len = MISR;

MISR is defined to 0x3C which is also equivalent to ETH_ZLEN, but use
ETH_ZLEN directly which is exactly what we want to be checking for.
