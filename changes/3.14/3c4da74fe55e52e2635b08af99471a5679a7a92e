[media] adv7842: 625/525 line standard jitter fix

Both the PAL and NTSC standards are interlaced where a
frame consist of two fields. Total number of lines in a frame in both systems
are an odd number so the two fields will have different length.

In the 625 line standard ("PAL") the odd field of the frame is transmitted first,
while in the 525 standard ("NTSC") the even field is transmitted first.

This adds the possibility to change output config between the fields and standards.

This setting will reduce the "format-jitter" on the signal sent by the pixelport
moving the difference between the fields to vertical front/back-porch only.
