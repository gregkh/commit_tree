btrfs: Add "barrier" option to support "-o remount,barrier"

Btrfs can be remounted without barrier, but there is no "barrier" option
so nobody can remount btrfs back with barrier on. Only umount and
mount again can re-enable barrier.(Quite awkward)

Also the mount options in the document is also changed slightly for the
further pairing options changes.
