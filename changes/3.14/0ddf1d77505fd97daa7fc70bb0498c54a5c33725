[SCSI] hpsa: do not require board "not ready" status after hard reset

Immediately following a hard board reset, There are some
mandatory delays during which we must not access the board
and during which we might miss the "not ready" status,
therefore it is a mistake to look for and expect to see
the "not ready" status.
