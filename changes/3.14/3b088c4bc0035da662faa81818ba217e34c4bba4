netfilter: nf_tables: make chain types override the default AF functions

Currently the AF-specific hook functions override the chain-type specific
hook functions. That doesn't make too much sense since the chain types
are a special case of the AF-specific hooks.

Make the AF-specific hook functions the default and make the optional
chain type hooks override them.

As a side effect, the necessary code restructuring reduces the code size,
f.i. in case of nf_tables_ipv4.o:

  nf_tables_ipv4_init_net   |  -24
  nft_do_chain_ipv4         | -113
 2 functions changed, 137 bytes removed, diff: -137
