tracing: Add 'snapshot' event trigger command

Add 'snapshot' event_command.  snapshot event triggers are added by
the user via this command in a similar way and using practically the
same syntax as the analogous 'snapshot' ftrace function command, but
instead of writing to the set_ftrace_filter file, the snapshot event
trigger is written to the per-event 'trigger' files:

    echo 'snapshot' > .../somesys/someevent/trigger

The above command will turn on snapshots for someevent i.e. whenever
someevent is hit, a snapshot will be done.

This also adds a 'count' version that limits the number of times the
command will be invoked:

    echo 'snapshot:N' > .../somesys/someevent/trigger

Where N is the number of times the command will be invoked.

The above command will snapshot N times for someevent i.e. whenever
someevent is hit N times, a snapshot will be done.

Also adds a new tracing_alloc_snapshot() function - the existing
tracing_snapshot_alloc() function is a special version of
tracing_snapshot() that also does the snapshot allocation - the
snapshot triggers would like to be able to do just the allocation but
not take a snapshot; the existing tracing_snapshot_alloc() in turn now
also calls tracing_alloc_snapshot() underneath to do that allocation.
