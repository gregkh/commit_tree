drivers/video/backlight/lcd.c: call put_device if device_register fails

Currently we kfree the container of the device which failed to register.
This is wrong as the last reference is not given up with a put_device
call.  Also, now that we have put_device() callen, we no longer need the
kfree as the new_ld->dev.release function will take care of kfreeing the
associated memory.
