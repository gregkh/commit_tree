ARM: 7946/1: asm: __und_usr_thumb need byteswap instructions in BE case

__und_usr_thumb function deals with thumb2 opcodes. In case of BE
image, it needs to byteswap half word thumb2 encoded instructions
before further processing them.

Without this fix BE image user-land thread executing first VFP
instruction encoded in thumb2 fails with SIGILL, because kernel
does not recognize instruction and does not enable VFP.
