cifs: Fix check for regular file in couldbe_mf_symlink()

MF Symlinks are regular files containing content in a specified format.

The function couldbe_mf_symlink() checks the mode for a set S_IFREG bit
as a test to confirm that it is a regular file. This bit is also set for
other filetypes and simply checking for this bit being set may return
false positives.

We ensure that we are actually checking for a regular file by using the
S_ISREG macro to test instead.
