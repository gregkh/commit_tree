GFS2: Increase i_writecount during gfs2_setattr_chown

This patch calls get_write_access in function gfs2_setattr_chown,
which merely increases inode->i_writecount for the duration of the
function. That will ensure that any file closes won't delete the
inode's multi-block reservation while the function is running.
It also ensures that a multi-block reservation exists when needed
for quota change operations during the chown.
