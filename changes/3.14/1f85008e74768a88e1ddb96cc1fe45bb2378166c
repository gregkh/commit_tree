arm64: enable generic clockevent broadcast

On platforms with power management capabilities, timers that are shut
down when a CPU enters deep C-states must be emulated using an always-on
timer and a timer IPI to relay the timer IRQ to target CPUs on an SMP
system.

This patch enables the generic clockevents broadcast infrastructure for
arm64, by providing the required Kconfig entries and adding the timer
IPI infrastructure.
