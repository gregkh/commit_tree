mac80211: add generic cipher scheme support

This adds generic cipher scheme support to mac80211, such schemes
are fully under control by the driver. On hw registration drivers
may specify additional HW ciphers with a scheme how these ciphers
have to be handled by mac80211 TX/RR. A cipher scheme specifies a
cipher suite value, a size of the security header to be added to
or stripped from frames and how the PN is to be verified on RX.
