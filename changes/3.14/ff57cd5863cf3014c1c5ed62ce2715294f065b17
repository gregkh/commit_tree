fsnotify: Allocate overflow events with proper type

Commit 7053aee26a35 "fsnotify: do not share events between notification
groups" used overflow event statically allocated in a group with the
size of the generic notification event. This causes problems because
some code looks at type specific parts of event structure and gets
confused by a random data it sees there and causes crashes.

Fix the problem by allocating overflow event with type corresponding to
the group type so code cannot get confused.
