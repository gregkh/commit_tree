staging: lustre: fix quotactl permission denied (LU-4530)

The changes introduced in commit 4b1a25f06b30b203 ("fix build when
CONFIG_UIDGID_STRICT_TYPE_CHECKS is on") got the UID check the wrong way
around, leading to "Permission denied" when a regular user attempts to
retrieve his quota (lfs quota -u ...) but allowing him to retrieve other
users quota.
