hpfs: remember free space

Previously, hpfs scanned all bitmaps each time the user asked for free
space using statfs.  This patch changes it so that hpfs scans the
bitmaps only once, remembes the free space and on next invocation of
statfs it returns the value instantly.

New versions of wine are hammering on the statfs syscall very heavily,
making some games unplayable when they're stored on hpfs, with load
times in minutes.

This should be backported to the stable kernels because it fixes
user-visible problem (excessive level load times in wine).
