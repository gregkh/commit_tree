usb: gadget: nokia: fix error recovery path for optional functions

In the nokia gadget some USB functions (obex 1 and 2, phonet) are optional.

If at the start of nokia_bind_config e.g. fi_phonet is an error pointer,
which can happen because we don't fail the bind process if
usb_get_function_instance() fails for fi_phonet, then f_phonet is NULL, and

phonet_stat = usb_add_function(c, f_phonet);

is never called and phonet_stat remains 0.

If, in these circumstances, we hit the err_conf label then !phonet_stat
evaluates to true and we try usb_remove_function() with its second
parameter being f_phonet which is NULL and it causes NULL pointer
dereference.

This patch changes the initial values of (obex1|obex2|phonet)_stat to a
nonzero value so that if the err_conf label is hit while the respective
functions have not been acquired the usb_remove_function() is not called
for those functions.
