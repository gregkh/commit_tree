x86: Add xloadflags bit for EFI runtime support on kexec

Old kexec-tools can not load new kernels. The reason is kexec-tools does
not fill efi_info in x86 setup header previously, thus EFI failed to
initialize.  In new kexec-tools it will by default to fill efi_info and
pass other EFI required infomation to 2nd kernel so kexec kernel EFI
initialization can succeed finally.

To prevent from breaking userspace, add a new xloadflags bit so
kexec-tools can check the flag and switch to old logic.
