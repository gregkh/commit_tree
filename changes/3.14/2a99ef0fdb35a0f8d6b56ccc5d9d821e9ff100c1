ASoC: compress: Add suport for DPCM into compressed audio

Currently compressed audio streams are statically routed from the /dev
to the DAI link. Some DSPs can route compressed data to multiple BE DAIs
like they do for PCM data.

Add support to allow dynamically routed compressed streams using the existing
DPCM infrastructure. This patch adds special FE versions of the compressed ops
that work out the runtime routing.
