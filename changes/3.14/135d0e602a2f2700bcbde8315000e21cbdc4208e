ARM: shmobile: r8a7791: Don't define SCIF platform data in an array

The SCIF driver is transitioning to platform resources. Board code will
thus need to define an array of resources for each SCIF device. This is
incompatible with the macro-based SCIF platform data definition as an
array. Rework the macro to define platform data as individual
structures.
