ARM: tegra: document reset properties in DT bindings

Update all the Tegra DT bindings to require resets/reset-names properties
where the HW module has reset inputs. Remove any entries from clocks or
clock-names that were only required to identify reset inputs, rather than
referring to real clocks.

This is a DT-ABI-incompatible change. It is the first of two changes
required for me to consider the Tegra DT bindings as stable, the other
being conversion to the common DMA DT bindings.
