xen/mmu: Cleanup xen_pagetable_p2m_copy a bit.

Stefano noticed that the code runs only under 64-bit so
the comments about 32-bit are pointless.

Also we change the condition for xen_revector_p2m_tree
returning the same value (because it could not allocate
a swath of space to put the new P2M in) or it had been
called once already. In such we return early from the
function.
