powerpc/mm: Add new "set" flag argument to pte/pmd update function

pte_update() is a powerpc-ism used to change the bits of a PTE
when the access permission is being restricted (a flush is
potentially needed).

It uses atomic operations on when needed and handles the hash
synchronization on hash based processors.

It is currently only used to clear PTE bits and so the current
implementation doesn't provide a way to also set PTE bits.

The new _PAGE_NUMA bit, when set, is actually restricting access
so it must use that function too, so this change adds the ability
for pte_update() to also set bits.

We will use this later to set the _PAGE_NUMA bit.
