clk: mpc512x: introduce COMMON_CLK for MPC512x (disabled)

this change implements a clock driver for the MPC512x PowerPC platform
which follows the COMMON_CLK approach and uses common clock drivers
shared with other platforms

this driver implements the publicly announced set of clocks (those
listed in the dt-bindings header file), as well as generates additional
'struct clk' items where the SoC hardware cannot easily get mapped to
the common primitives (shared code) of the clock API, or requires
"intermediate clock nodes" to represent clocks that have both gates and
dividers

the previous PPC_CLOCK implementation is kept in place and remains
active for the moment, the newly introduced CCF clock driver will
receive additional support for backwards compatibility in a subsequent
patch before it gets enabled and will replace the PPC_CLOCK approach

some of the clock items get pre-enabled in the clock driver to not have
them automatically disabled by the underlying clock subsystem because of
their being unused -- this approach is desirable because
- some of the clocks are useful to have for diagnostics and information
  despite their not getting claimed by any drivers (CPU, internal and
  external RAM, internal busses, boot media)
- some of the clocks aren't claimed by their peripheral drivers yet,
  either because of missing driver support or because device tree specs
  aren't available yet (but the workarounds will get removed as the
  drivers get adjusted and the device tree provides the clock specs)

clkdev registration provides "alias names" for few clock items
- to not break those peripheral drivers which encode their component
  index into the name that is used for clock lookup (UART, SPI, USB)
- to not break those drivers which use names for the clock lookup which
  were encoded in the previous PPC_CLOCK implementation (NFC, VIU, CAN)
this workaround will get removed as these drivers get adjusted after
device tree based clock lookup has become available

the COMMON_CLK implementation copes with device trees which lack an
oscillator node (backwards compat), the REF clock is then derived from
the IPS bus frequency and multiplier values fetched from hardware
