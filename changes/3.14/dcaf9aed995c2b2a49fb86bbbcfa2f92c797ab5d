[SCSI] bfa: Chinook quad port 16G FC HBA claim issue

Bfa driver crash is observed while pushing the firmware on to chinook
quad port card due to uninitialized bfi_image_ct2 access which gets
initialized only for CT2 ASIC based cards after request_firmware().
For quard port chinook (CT2 ASIC based), bfi_image_ct2 is not getting
initialized as there is no check for chinook PCI device ID before
request_firmware and instead bfi_image_cb is initialized as it is the
default case for card type check.

This patch includes changes to read the right firmware for quad port chinook.
