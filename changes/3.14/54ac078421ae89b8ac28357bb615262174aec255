gpu: ion: several bugfixes and enhancements of ION

1. Verifying if the size of memory allocation in ion_alloc() is aligned
by PAGE_SIZE at least. If it is not, this change makes the size to be
aligned by PAGE_SIZE.

2. Unmaps all mappings to the kernel and DMA address spaces when
destroying ion_buffer in ion_buffer_destroy(). This prevents leaks in
those virtual address spaces.

3. Makes the return value of ion_alloc() to be explicit Linux error code
when it fails to allocate a buffer.

4. Makes ion_alloc() implementation simpler. Removes 'goto' statement and
relavant call to ion_buffer_put().

5. Checks if the task is valid before calling put_task_struct() due
to failure on creating a ion client in ion_client_create().

6. Returns error when buffer allocation requested by userspace is failed.
