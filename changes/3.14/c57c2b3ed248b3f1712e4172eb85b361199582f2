Btrfs: unlock inodes in correct order in clone ioctl

In the clone ioctl, when the source and target inodes are different,
we can acquire their mutexes in 2 possible different orders. After
we're done cloning, we were releasing the mutexes always in the same
order - the most correct way of doing it is to release them by the
reverse order they were acquired.
