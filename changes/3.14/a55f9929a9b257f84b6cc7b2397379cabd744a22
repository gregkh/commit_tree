arm64: Invalidate the TLB when replacing pmd entries during boot

With the 64K page size configuration, __create_page_tables in head.S
maps enough memory to get started but using 64K pages rather than 512M
sections with a single pgd/pud/pmd entry pointing to a pte table.
create_mapping() may override the pgd/pud/pmd table entry with a block
(section) one if the RAM size is more than 512MB and aligned correctly.
For the end of this block to be accessible, the old TLB entry must be
invalidated.
