Bluetooth: Fix setting Universal/Local bit

This patch fixes the Bluetooth Low Energy Address type checking when
setting Universal/Local bit for the 6loWPAN network device or for the
peer device connection.

ADDR_LE_DEV_PUBLIC or ADDR_LE_DEV_RANDOM are the values allowed for
"src_type" and "dst_type" in the hci_conn struct. The Bluetooth link
type can be obtainned reading the "type" field in the same struct.
