mtip32xx: Correctly handle security locked condition

If power is removed during a secure erase, the drive will end up in a
security locked condition.  This patch causes the driver to identify,
log, and flag the security lock state.  IOs are prevented from
submission to the drive until the locked state is addressed with a
secure erase.

Bumped version number to reflect this capability.
