drm/msm: add a330/apq8x74

Add support for adreno 330.  Not too much different, just a few
differences in initial configuration plus setting OCMEM base.
Userspace support is already in upstream mesa.

Note that the existing DT code is simply using the bindings from
downstream android kernel, to simplify porting of this driver to
existing devices.  These do not constitute any committed/stable
DT ABI.  The addition of proper DT bindings will be a subsequent
patch, at which point (as best as possible) I will try to support
either upstream bindings or what is found in downstream android
kernel, so that existing device DT files can be used.
