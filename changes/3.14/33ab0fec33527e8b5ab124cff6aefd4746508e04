posix-timers: Consolidate posix_cpu_clock_get()

Consolidate the clock sampling common code used for both local
and remote targets.

Note that this introduces a tiny user ABI change: if a
PID is passed to clock_gettime() along the clockid,
we used to forbid a process wide clock sample when that
PID doesn't belong to a group leader. Now after this patch
we allow process wide clock samples if that PID belongs to
the current task, even if the current task is not the
group leader.

But local process wide clock samples are allowed if PID == 0
(current task) even if the current task is not the group leader.
So in the end this should be no big deal as this actually harmonize
the behaviour when the remote sample is actually a local one.
