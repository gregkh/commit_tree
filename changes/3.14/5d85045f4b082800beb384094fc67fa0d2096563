USB: pl2303: use direct baud-rate encoding when possible

Use direct baud-rate encoding rather than divisors for supported baud
rates.

This restores the way baud rates were set prior to commit 8d48fdf689fe
("USB: PL2303: correctly handle baudrates above 115200") which added
divisor encoding, but also switched to the new encoding method for all
baudrates above 115200.

As noted by Frank Schäfer <fschaefer.oss@googlemail.com>, baud rate 500k
was later errounously added to the supported baud-rate table although
it can only be set using divisors.

Note that the current implementation could easily be extended to support
arbitrary non-standard baud rates using divisors (e.g. by falling back
to divisors when the table lookup fails).
