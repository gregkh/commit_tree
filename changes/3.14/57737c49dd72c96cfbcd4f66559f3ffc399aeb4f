parisc: fix cache-flushing

This commit:
f8dae00684d678afa13041ef170cecfd1297ed40: parisc: Ensure full cache coherency for kmap/kunmap
caused negative caching side-effects, e.g. hanging processes with expect and
too many inequivalent alias messages from flush_dcache_page() on Debian 5 systems.

This patch now partly reverts it and has been in production use on our debian buildd
makeservers since a week without any major problems.
