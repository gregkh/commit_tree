staging: ctxt1e1: Fixed sparse warning related to static declaration

Fixed below thrown sparse warning by making the local
variable declaration static:

drivers/staging/cxt1e1/musycc.c:1:14: warning: symbol 'max_intcnt' was
not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/staging/cxt1e1/musycc.c:2:14: warning: symbol 'max_bh' was not
declared. Should it be static?
