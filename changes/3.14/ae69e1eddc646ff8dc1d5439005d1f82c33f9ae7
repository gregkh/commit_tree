Revert "powerpc/pseries/iommu: remove default window before attempting DDW manipulation"

Ben rightfully pointed out that there is a race in the "newer" DDW code.
Presuming we are running on recent enough firmware that supports the
"reset" DDW manipulation call, we currently always remove the base
32-bit DMA window in order to maximize the resources for Phyp when
creating the 64-bit window. However, this can be problematic for the
case where multiple functions are in the same PE (partitionable
endpoint), where some funtions might be 32-bit DMA only. All of a
sudden, the only functional DMA window for such functions is gone. We
will have serious errors in such situations. The best solution is simply
to revert the extension to the DDW code where we ever remove the base
DMA window.

This reverts commit 25ebc45b93452d0bc60271f178237123c4b26808.
