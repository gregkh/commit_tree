usb: cdc-wdm: avoid hanging on zero length reads

commit 73e06865ead1 ("USB: cdc-wdm: support back-to-back
USB_CDC_NOTIFY_RESPONSE_AVAILABLE notifications") implemented
queued response handling. This added a new requirement: The read
urb must be resubmitted every time we clear the WDM_READ flag if
the response counter indicates that the device is waiting for a
read.

Fix by factoring out the code handling the WMD_READ clearing and
possible urb submission, calling it everywhere we clear the flag.

Without this fix, the driver ends up in a state where the read urb
is inactive, but the response counter is positive after a zero
length read.  This prevents the read urb from ever being submitted
again and the driver appears to be hanging.
