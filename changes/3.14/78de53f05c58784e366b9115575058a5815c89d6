net: pxa168_eth: use phy_init_hw for PHY reset

Instead of open-coding a PHY reset through the MII BMCR register, use
phy_init_hw() which does this for us and ensures that PHY device fixups
are also applied. We also remove a call to ethernet_phy_reset() which is
now unncessary since phy_attach() calls phy_attach_direct() which in
turns calls phy_init_hw().
