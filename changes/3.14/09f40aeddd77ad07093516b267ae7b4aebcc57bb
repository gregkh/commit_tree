ixgbe: Indicate removal state explicitly

Add a bit, __IXGBE_REMOVING, to indicate that the module is being
removed. The __IXGBE_DOWN bit had been overloaded for this purpose,
but that leads to trouble. A few places now check both __IXGBE_DOWN
and __IXGBE_REMOVE. Notably, setting either bit will prevent service
task execution.
