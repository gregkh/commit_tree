ipc,msg: document barriers

Both expunge_all() and pipeline_send() rely on both a nil msg value and
a full barrier to guarantee the correct ordering when waking up a task.

While its counterpart at the receiving end is well documented for the
lockless recv algorithm, we still need to document these specific
smp_mb() calls.
