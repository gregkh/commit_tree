USB: fix: ohci-at91 mismerge build error

After commit 99f14bd4d1 "Merge 3.13-rc5 into usb-next" (in linux-next as of
today), I'm getting this error building any at91 kernel:

drivers/usb/host/ohci-at91.c: In function 'usb_hcd_at91_probe':
drivers/usb/host/ohci-at91.c:190:4: error: label 'err' used but not defined
    goto err;
    ^
drivers/usb/host/ohci-at91.c: At top level:
drivers/usb/host/ohci-at91.c:206:2: warning: data definition has no type or storage class [enabled by default]
  at91_stop_hc(pdev);
  ^
...

The problem is obviously a mismerge between two unrelated changes that
resulted in missing opening braces.
