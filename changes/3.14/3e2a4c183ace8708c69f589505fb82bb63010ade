test: check copy_to/from_user boundary validation

To help avoid an architecture failing to correctly check kernel/user
boundaries when handling copy_to_user, copy_from_user, put_user, or
get_user, perform some simple tests and fail to load if any of them
behave unexpectedly.

Specifically, this is to make sure there is a way to notice if things
like what was fixed in commit 8404663f81d2 ("ARM: 7527/1: uaccess:
explicitly check __user pointer when !CPU_USE_DOMAINS") ever regresses
again, for any architecture.

Additionally, adds new "user" selftest target, which loads this module.
