clk: at91: add PMC master clock

This patch adds new at91 master clock implementation using common clk
framework.

The master clock layout describe the MCKR register layout.
There are 2 master clock layouts:
- at91rm9200
- at91sam9x5

Master clocks are given characteristics:
- min/max clock output rate

These characteristics are checked during rate change to avoid
over/underclocking.

These characteristics are described in atmel's SoC datasheet in
"Electrical Characteristics" paragraph.
