tracing: Add 'traceon' and 'traceoff' event trigger commands

Add 'traceon' and 'traceoff' event_command commands.  traceon and
traceoff event triggers are added by the user via these commands in a
similar way and using practically the same syntax as the analagous
'traceon' and 'traceoff' ftrace function commands, but instead of
writing to the set_ftrace_filter file, the traceon and traceoff
triggers are written to the per-event 'trigger' files:

    echo 'traceon' > .../tracing/events/somesys/someevent/trigger
    echo 'traceoff' > .../tracing/events/somesys/someevent/trigger

The above command will turn tracing on or off whenever someevent is
hit.

This also adds a 'count' version that limits the number of times the
command will be invoked:

    echo 'traceon:N' > .../tracing/events/somesys/someevent/trigger
    echo 'traceoff:N' > .../tracing/events/somesys/someevent/trigger

Where N is the number of times the command will be invoked.

The above commands will will turn tracing on or off whenever someevent
is hit, but only N times.

Some common register/unregister_trigger() implementations of the
event_command reg()/unreg() callbacks are also provided, which add and
remove trigger instances to the per-event list of triggers, and
arm/disarm them as appropriate.  event_trigger_callback() is a
general-purpose event_command func() implementation that orchestrates
command parsing and registration for most normal commands.

Most event commands will use these, but some will override and
possibly reuse them.

The event_trigger_init(), event_trigger_free(), and
event_trigger_print() functions are meant to be common implementations
of the event_trigger_ops init(), free(), and print() ops,
respectively.

Most trigger_ops implementations will use these, but some will
override and possibly reuse them.
