bonding: use __dev_get_by_name instead of dev_get_by_name to find interface

The following call chain indicates that bond_do_ioctl() is protected
under rtnl_lock. If we use __dev_get_by_name() instead of
dev_get_by_name() to find interface handler in it, this would
help us avoid to change reference counter of interface once.

dev_ioctl()
  rtnl_lock()
  dev_ifsioc()
    bond_do_ioctl()
  rtnl_unlock()

Additionally we also change the coding style in bond_do_ioctl(),
letting it more readable for us.
