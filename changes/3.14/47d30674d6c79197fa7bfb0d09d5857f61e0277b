s390/css: Prevent unnecessary allocation in subchannel loop

Subchannel looping function for_each_subchannel_staged() allocates a
subchannel-ID-bitmap to efficiently iterate over the list of known
and unknown subchannels. Since this function is also used to iterate
over known-subchannels only, optimize that case by not requiring the
ID-bitmap allocation and falling back to simple bus_for_each_dev()
looping.
