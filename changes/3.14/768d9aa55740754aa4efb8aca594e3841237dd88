Input: don't call input_dev_release_keys() in resume

When waking up the platform by pressing a specific key, sending a
release on that key makes it impossible to react on the event in
user-space. This is fixed by moving the input_reset_device() call to
resume instead.

[dmitry.torokhov@gmail.com: make sure we still restore LED/sound state
after resume, handle hibernation properly]
