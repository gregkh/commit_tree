ASoC: mmp: Don't set unused struct snd_pcm_hardware fields

The ASoC core assumes that the PCM component of the ASoC card transparently
moves data around and does not impose any restrictions on the memory layout or
the transfer speed. It ignores all fields from the snd_pcm_hardware struct for
the PCM driver that are related to this. Setting these fields in the PCM driver
might suggest otherwise though, so rather not set them.
