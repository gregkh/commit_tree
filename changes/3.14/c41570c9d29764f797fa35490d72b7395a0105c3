btrfs: fix defrag 32-bit integer overflow

When defragging a very large file, the cluster variable can wrap its 32-bit
signed int type and become negative, which eventually gets passed to
btrfs_force_ra() as a very large unsigned long value.  On 32-bit platforms,
this eventually results in an Oops from the SLAB allocator.

Change the cluster and max_cluster signed int variables to unsigned long to
match the readahead functions.  This also allows the min() comparison in
btrfs_defrag_file() to work as intended.
