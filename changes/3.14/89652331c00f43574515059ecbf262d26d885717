batman-adv: split tq information in neigh_node struct

For the network wide multi interface optimization it is required to save
metrics per outgoing interface in one neighbor. Therefore a new type is
introduced to keep interface-specific information. This also requires
some changes in access and list management.

The compare and equiv_or_better API calls are changed to take the
outgoing interface into consideration.
