mm: get rid of unnecessary pageblock scanning in setup_zone_migrate_reserve

Yasuaki Ishimatsu reported memory hot-add spent more than 5 _hours_ on
9TB memory machine since onlining memory sections is too slow.  And we
found out setup_zone_migrate_reserve spent >90% of the time.

The problem is, setup_zone_migrate_reserve scans all pageblocks
unconditionally, but it is only necessary if the number of reserved
block was reduced (i.e.  memory hot remove).

Moreover, maximum MIGRATE_RESERVE per zone is currently 2.  It means
that the number of reserved pageblocks is almost always unchanged.

This patch adds zone->nr_migrate_reserve_block to maintain the number of
MIGRATE_RESERVE pageblocks and it reduces the overhead of
setup_zone_migrate_reserve dramatically.  The following table shows time
of onlining a memory section.

  Amount of memory     | 128GB | 192GB | 256GB|
  ---------------------------------------------
  linux-3.12           |  23.9 |  31.4 | 44.5 |
  This patch           |   8.3 |   8.3 |  8.6 |
  Mel's proposal patch |  10.9 |  19.2 | 31.3 |
  ---------------------------------------------
                                   (millisecond)

  128GB : 4 nodes and each node has 32GB of memory
  192GB : 6 nodes and each node has 32GB of memory
  256GB : 8 nodes and each node has 32GB of memory
