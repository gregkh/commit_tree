perf completion: Factor out call to __ltrim_colon_completions

In our sole callsite, __ltrim_colon_completions is called after
__perfcomp, to modify the COMPREPLY set by the invocation.

This is problematic, because in the zsh equivalent (using compset/
compadd), we'll have to generate completions in one-shot.

So factor out this entire callsite into a special override'able
__perfcomp_colon function; we will override it when introducing zsh
support.
