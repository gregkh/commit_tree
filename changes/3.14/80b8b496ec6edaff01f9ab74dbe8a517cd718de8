perf script: Print callchains and symbols if they exist

The intent of perf-script is to dump the events and information in the
file. H/W, S/W and raw events all dump callchains if they are present;
might as well make that the default for tracepoints too.

v2: Only add options for sym, dso and ip if callchains are present
