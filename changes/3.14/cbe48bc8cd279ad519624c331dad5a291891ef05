x86: Don't introduce more __cpuinit users in intel_mid_weak_decls.h

Commit 85611e3febe78955a519f5f9eb47b941525c8c76 ("x86, intel-mid:
Add Clovertrail platform support") added new instances of __cpuinit
usage.  We removed this a couple versions ago; we now want to remove
the compat no-op stubs.  Introducing new users is not what we want to
see at this point in time, as it will break once the stubs are gone.
