btrfs: fix warning while merging two adjacent extents

When we have two adjacent extents in relink_extent_backref,
we try to merge them. When we use btrfs_search_slot to locate the
slot for the current extent, we shouldn't set "ins_len = 1",
because we will merge it into the previous extent rather than
insert a new item. Otherwise, we may happen to create a new leaf
in btrfs_search_slot and path->slot[0] will be 0. Then we try to
fetch the previous item using "path->slots[0]--", and it will cause
a warning as follows:

I encounter this warning when running defrag having mkfs.btrfs
with option -M. At the same time there are read/writes & snapshots
running at background.
