x86, kaslr: Raise the maximum virtual address to -1 GiB on x86_64

On 64-bit, this raises the maximum location to -1 GiB (from -1.5 GiB),
the upper limit currently, since the kernel fixmap page mappings need
to be moved to use the other 1 GiB (which would be the theoretical
limit when building with -mcmodel=kernel).
