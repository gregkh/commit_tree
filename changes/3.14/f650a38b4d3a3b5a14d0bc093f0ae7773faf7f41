i40e: refactor reset code

In order to re-size queues and vectors while the interface is
still up, we need to be able to call functions to free and
re-allocate without bringing down the VSI.

We also need to reset the existing setup, update the
configuration and then rebuild again. This requires us to have
the reset flow broken down into two parts.
