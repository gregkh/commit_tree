[media] exynos4-is: Activate mipi-csis in probe() if runtime PM is disabled

Devices should also operate normally when runtime PM is not enabled.
In case runtime PM is disabled activate the device already in probe().
Any related power domain needs to be then left permanently in active
state by the platform.
