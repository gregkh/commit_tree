be2net: Fix to reset transparent vlan tagging

For disabling transparent tagging issue SET_HSW_CONFIG with pvid_valid=1
and pvid=0xFFFF and not with the default pvid as this case would fail in Lancer.
Hence removing the get_hsw_config call from be_vf_setup() as it's
only use of getting default pvid is no longer needed.

Also do proper housekeeping only if the FW command succeeds.
