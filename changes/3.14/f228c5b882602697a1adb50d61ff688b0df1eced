perf/x86/intel: Add Intel RAPL PP1 energy counter support

This patch adds support for the Intel RAPL energy counter
PP1 (Power Plane 1).

On client processors, it usually corresponds to the
energy consumption of the builtin graphic card. That
is why the sysfs event is called energy-gpu.

New event:
 - name: power/energy-gpu/
 - code: event=0x4
 - unit: 2^-32 Joules

On processors without graphics, this should count 0.
The patch only enables this event on client processors.
