tracing/probes: Split [ku]probes_fetch_type_table

Use separate fetch_type_table for kprobes and uprobes.  It currently
shares all fetch methods but some of them will be implemented
differently later.

This is not to break build if [ku]probes is configured alone (like
!CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENT and CONFIG_UPROBE_EVENT).  So I added '__weak'
to the table declaration so that it can be safely omitted when it
configured out.
