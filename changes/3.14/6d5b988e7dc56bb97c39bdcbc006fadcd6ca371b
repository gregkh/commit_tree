clk: tegra: implement a reset driver

The Tegra CAR module implements both a clock and reset controller. So
far, the driver exposes the clock feature via the common clock API and
the reset feature using a custom API. This patch adds an implementation
of the common reset framework API (include/linux/reset*.h). The legacy
reset implementation will be removed once all drivers have been
converted.
