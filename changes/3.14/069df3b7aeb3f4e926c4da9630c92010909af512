cgroup: remove cgroup_pidlist->rwsem

cgroup_pidlist locking is needlessly complicated.  It has outer
cgroup->pidlist_mutex to protect the list of pidlists associated with
a cgroup and then each pidlist has rwsem to synchronize updates and
reads.  Given that the only read access is from seq_file operations
which are always invoked back-to-back, the rwsem is a giant overkill.
All it does is adding unnecessary complexity.

This patch removes cgroup_pidlist->rwsem and protects all accesses to
pidlists belonging to a cgroup with cgroup->pidlist_mutex.
pidlist->rwsem locking is removed if it's nested inside
cgroup->pidlist_mutex; otherwise, it's replaced with
cgroup->pidlist_mutex locking.
