x86: Don't add new __cpuinit users to Merrifield platform code

Commit bc20aa48bbb3068224a1c91f8332971fdb689fad ("x86, intel-mid:
Add Merrifield platform support")  added new instances of __cpuinit
usage.  We removed this a couple versions ago; we now want to remove
the compat no-op stubs.  Introducing new users is not what we want to
see at this point in time, as it will break once the stubs are gone.

This also fixes an out of sync __init vs. __cpuinit -- as the former
is real, and the latter is a no-op; hence it would have been a section
mismatch.
