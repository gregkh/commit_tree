tty: Halve flip buffer GFP_ATOMIC memory consumption

tty flip buffers use GFP_ATOMIC allocations for received data
which is to be processed by the line discipline. For each byte
received, an extra byte is used to indicate the error status of
that byte.

Instead, if the received data is error-free, encode the entire
buffer without status bytes.
