staging: comedi: fix too early cleanup in comedi_auto_config()

`comedi_auto_config()` is usually called from the probe routine of a
low-level comedi driver to allocate and auto-configure a comedi device.
Part of this involves calling the low-level driver's `auto_attach()`
handler, and if that is successful, `comedi_device_postconfig()` tries
to complete the configuration of the comedi device.  If either of those
fail, `comedi_device_detach()` is called to clean up, and
`comedi_release_hardware_device()` is called to remove the dynamically
allocated comedi device.

Unfortunately, `comedi_device_detach()` clears the `hw_dev` member of
the `struct comedi_device` (indirectly via `comedi_clear_hw_dev()`), and
that stops `comedi_release_hardware_device()` finding the comedi device
associated with the hardware device, so the comedi device won't be
removed properly.

Since `comedi_release_hardware_device()` also calls
`comedi_device_detach()` (assuming it finds the comedi device associated
with the hardware device), the fix is to remove the direct call to
`comedi_device_detach()` from `comedi_auto_config()` and let the call to
`comedi_release_hardware_device()` take care of it.
