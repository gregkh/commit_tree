[media] Revert "[media] videobuf_vm_{open,close} race fixes"

This reverts commit a242f426108c284049a69710f871cc9f11b13e61.

That commit actually caused deadlocks, rather then fixing them.

If ext_lock is set to NULL (otherwise videobuf_queue_lock doesn't do
anything), then you get this deadlock:

The driver's mmap function calls videobuf_mmap_mapper which calls
videobuf_queue_lock on q. videobuf_mmap_mapper calls  __videobuf_mmap_mapper,
__videobuf_mmap_mapper calls videobuf_vm_open and videobuf_vm_open
calls videobuf_queue_lock on q (introduced by above patch): deadlocked.

This affects drivers using dma-contig and dma-vmalloc. Only dma-sg is
not affected since it doesn't call videobuf_vm_open from __videobuf_mmap_mapper.

Most drivers these days have a non-NULL ext_lock. Those that still use
NULL there are all fairly obscure drivers, which is why this hasn't been
seen earlier.

Since everything worked perfectly fine for many years I prefer to just
revert this patch rather than trying to fix it. videobuf is quite fragile
and I rather not touch it too much. Work is (slowly) progressing to move
everything over to vb2 or at the very least use non-NULL ext_lock in
videobuf.
