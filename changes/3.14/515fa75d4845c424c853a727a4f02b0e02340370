MIPS: BCM47XX: Prepare support for LEDs

So far this is mostly just a proof of concept, database consists of a
single device. Creating a nice iterateable array wasn't an option
because devices have different amount of LEDs. And we don't want to
waste memory just because of support for a device with dozens on LEDs.
