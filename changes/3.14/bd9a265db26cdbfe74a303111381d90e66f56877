sfc: Add RX packet timestamping for EF10

The EF10 firmware can optionally insert RX timestamps in the packet
prefix.  These only include the clock minor value.  We must also
enable periodic time sync events on each event queue which provide
the high bits of the clock value.

[bwh: Combined and rebased several changes.
 Added the above description and some sanity checks for inline vs
 separate timestamps.
 Changed efx_rx_skb_attach_timestamp() to read the packet prefix
 from the skb head area.]
