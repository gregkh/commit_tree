perf evlist: Send the errno in the signal when workload fails

When a tool uses perf_evlist__start_workload and the supplied workload
fails (e.g.: its binary wasn't found), perror was being used to print
the error reason.

This is undesirable, as the caller may be a GUI, when it wants to have
total control of the error reporting process.

So move to using sigaction(SA_SIGINFO) + siginfo_t->sa_value->sival_int
to communicate to the caller the errno and let it print it using the UI
of its choosing.
