Revert "xhci: replace xhci_read_64() with readq()"

This reverts commit e8b373326d8efcaf9ec1da8b618556c89bd5ffc4.  Many xHCI
host controllers can only handle 32-bit addresses, and writing 64-bits
at a time causes them to fail.  Reading 64-bits at a time may also cause
them to return 0xffffffff, so revert this commit as well.
