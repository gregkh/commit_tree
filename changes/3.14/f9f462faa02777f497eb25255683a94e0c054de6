Bluetooth: Add quirk for disabling Delete Stored Link Key command

Some controller pretend they support the Delete Stored Link Key command,
but in reality they really don't support it.

  < HCI Command: Delete Stored Link Key (0x03|0x0012) plen 7
      bdaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00 all 1
  > HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 4
      Delete Stored Link Key (0x03|0x0012) ncmd 1
      status 0x11 deleted 0
      Error: Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value

Not correctly supporting this command causes the controller setup to
fail and will make a device not work. However sending the command for
controller that handle stored link keys is important. This quirk
allows a driver to disable the command if it knows that this command
handling is broken.
