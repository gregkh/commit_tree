serial: samsung: move clock deactivation below uart registration

Commit 60e93575476f (serial: samsung: enable clock before clearing pending
interrupts during init) added handling of the controller clock during init.

On most systems this clock is also one of the baud_clock sources and
possibly used by the earlycon and thus already enabled by the bootloader.

Therefore a gap exists between s3c24xx_serial_init_port disabling the
clock and an attached console reenabling it, making the transition from
earlycon to regular console possibly hang the system - as seen on my
S3C2442 based Freerunner today.

Therefore move the disabling of the clock from s3c24xx_serial_init_port
below the uart port registration, effectively creating an overlap and
keeping the clock running non-stop if the console wants to grab this port.
