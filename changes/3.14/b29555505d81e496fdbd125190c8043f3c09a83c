f2fs: add key functions for small discards

This patch adds key functions to activate the small discard feature.

Note that this procedure is conducted during the checkpoint only.

In flush_sit_entries(), when a new dirty sit entry is flushed, f2fs calls
add_discard_addrs() which searches candidates to be discarded.
The candidates should be marked *invalidated* and also previous checkpoint
recognizes it as *valid*.

At the end of a checkpoint procedure, f2fs throws discards based on the
discard entry list.
