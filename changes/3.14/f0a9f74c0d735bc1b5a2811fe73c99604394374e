drm/i915: Fix disabled semaphores

The ring will emit too many if semaphores are disabled since we do not
add the correct number to num_dwords anymore.

This was introduced:

    drm/i915: Don't emit mbox updates without semaphores

FWIW, the bug was fixed later in the series.

/me hangs head in shame.

Daniel: Also note that we should have merged the read-only semaphore
modparam before this patch.
