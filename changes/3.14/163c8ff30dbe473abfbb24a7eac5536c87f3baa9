bonding: 802.3ad: make aggregator_identifier bond-private

aggregator_identifier is used to assign unique aggregator identifiers
to aggregators of a bond during device enslaving.

aggregator_identifier is currently a global variable that is zeroed in
bond_3ad_initialize().

This sequence will lead to duplicate aggregator identifiers for eth1 and eth3:

create bond0
change bond0 mode to 802.3ad
enslave eth0 to bond0 		//eth0 gets agg id 1
enslave eth1 to bond0 		//eth1 gets agg id 2
create bond1
change bond1 mode to 802.3ad
enslave eth2 to bond1		//aggregator_identifier is reset to 0
				//eth2 gets agg id 1
enslave eth3 to bond0 		//eth3 gets agg id 2

Fix this by making aggregator_identifier private to the bond.
