dm thin: handle metadata failures more consistently

Introduce metadata_operation_failed() wrappers, around set_pool_mode(),
to assist with improving the consistency of how metadata failures are
handled.  Logging is improved and metadata operation failures trigger
read-only mode immediately.

Also, eliminate redundant set_pool_mode() calls in the two
alloc_data_block() caller's error paths.
