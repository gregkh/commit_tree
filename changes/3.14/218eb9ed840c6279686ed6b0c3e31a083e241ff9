HID: hid-sensor-hub: quirk for STM Sensor hub

Added STM sensor hub vendor id in HID_SENSOR_HUB_ENUM_QUIRK to
fix report descriptors. These devices uses old FW which uses
logical 0 as minimum. In these, HID reports are not using proper
collection classes. So we need to fix report descriptors,for
such devices. This will not have any impact, if the FW uses
logical 1 as minimum.

We look for usage id for "power and report state", and modify
logical minimum value to 1.

This is a follow-up patch to commit id 875e36f8.
