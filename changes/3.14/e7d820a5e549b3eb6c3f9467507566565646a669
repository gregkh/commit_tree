x86, xsave: Support eager-only xsave features, add MPX support

Some features, like Intel MPX, work only if the kernel uses eagerfpu
model.  So we should force eagerfpu on unless the user has explicitly
disabled it.

Add definitions for Intel MPX and add it to the supported list.

[ hpa: renamed XSTATE_FLEXIBLE to XSTATE_LAZY and added comments ]
