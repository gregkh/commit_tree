ARM: tegra: add missing unit addresses to DT

DT node names should include a unit address iff the node has a reg
property. For Tegra DTs at least, we were previously applying a different
rule, namely that node names only needed to include a unit address if it
was required to make the node name unique. Consequently, many unit
addresses are missing. Add them.
