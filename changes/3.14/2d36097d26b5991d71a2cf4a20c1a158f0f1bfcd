af_packet: Add Queue mapping mode to af_packet fanout operation

This patch adds a queue mapping mode to the fanout operation of af_packet
sockets.  This allows user space af_packet users to better filter on flows
ingressing and egressing via a specific hardware queue, and avoids the potential
packet reordering that can occur when FANOUT_CPU is being used and irq affinity
varies.

Tested successfully by myself.  applies to net-next
