x86, kaslr: Add a circular multiply for better bit diffusion

If we don't have RDRAND (in which case nothing else *should* matter),
most sources have a highly biased entropy distribution.  Use a
circular multiply to diffuse the entropic bits.  A circular multiply
is a good operation for this: it is cheap on standard hardware and
because it is symmetric (unlike an ordinary multiply) it doesn't
introduce its own bias.
