liblockdep: Add public headers for pthread_mutex_t implementation

These headers provide the same API as their pthread mutex
counterparts.

The design here is to allow to easily switch to liblockdep lock
validation just by adding a "liblockdep_" to pthread_mutex_*()
calls, which means that it's easy to integrate liblockdep into
existing codebases.
