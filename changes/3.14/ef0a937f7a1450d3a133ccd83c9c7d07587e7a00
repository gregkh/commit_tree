batman-adv: consider outgoing interface in OGM sending

The current OGM sending an aggregation functionality decides on
which interfaces a packet should be sent when it parses the forward
packet struct. However, with the network wide multi interface
optimization the outgoing interface is decided by the OGM processing
function.

This is reflected by moving the decision in the OGM processing function
and add the outgoing interface in the forwarding packet struct. This
practically implies that an OGM may be added multiple times (once per
outgoing interface), and this also affects aggregation which needs to
consider the outgoing interface as well.
