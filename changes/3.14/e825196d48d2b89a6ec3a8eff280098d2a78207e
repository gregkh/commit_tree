make prepend_name() work correctly when called with negative *buflen

In all callchains leading to prepend_name(), the value left in *buflen
is eventually discarded unused if prepend_name() has returned a negative.
So we are free to do what prepend() does, and subtract from *buflen
*before* checking for underflow (which turns into checking the sign
of subtraction result, of course).
