xen: balloon: enable for ARM

Since c275a57f5ec3 "xen/balloon: Set balloon's initial state to number of
existing RAM pages" the balloon driver appears to work fine on ARM as far as I
can tell. Prior to that commit it was broken because on ARM RAM doesn't
typically start at zero, effectively leaving a big MMIO hole at the start.
This would cause the balloon driver to give away all of RAM at start of day,
which is rather inconvenient.

It was already enabled (or rather not excluded) on ARM64. The
c1d15f5c8bc1170dafe16e988e55437245966dfe
"xen/balloon: Seperate the auto-translate logic properly (v2)"
added in the proper plumbing to work with ARM and PVH type guests.
