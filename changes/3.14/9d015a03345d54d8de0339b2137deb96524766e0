iwlwifi: mvm: rs: update expected TPT tables if aggregation changed

Expected TPT table was updated only when switching to a new
modulation. This is wrong as toggling aggregation changes
the expected TPT signficantly.
This leads to scenarios where turning aggregation on after
being in MIMO sends us back to SISO despite a perfect success
ratio.
This occurred because the TPT of the SISO mode was being
estimated based on aggregation while the MIMO one wasn't.

Also remove an error print which isn't an error anymore
since we might be updating the expected TPT table due
to aggregation changes.
