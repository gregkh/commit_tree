memcg, oom: lock mem_cgroup_print_oom_info

mem_cgroup_print_oom_info uses a static buffer (memcg_name) to store the
name of the cgroup.  This is not safe as pointed out by David Rientjes
because memcg oom is locked only for its hierarchy and nothing prevents
another parallel hierarchy to trigger oom as well and overwrite the
already in-use buffer.

This patch introduces oom_info_lock hidden inside
mem_cgroup_print_oom_info which is held throughout the function.  It
makes access to memcg_name safe and as a bonus it also prevents parallel
memcg ooms to interleave their statistics which would make the printed
data hard to analyze otherwise.
