ASoC: tegra: use reset framework

Tegra's clock driver now provides an implementation of the common
reset API (include/linux/reset.h). Use this instead of the old Tegra-
specific API; that will soon be removed.

This change also renames "clock"/"clk" to "modules"/"mod" in symbols
related to entries in configlink_clocks[], since:
- We don't care about clock handles any more, but rather reset handles,
  so the old name isn't applicable.
- It really is a list of modules on the bus, about which we currently
  only care about reset handles.
If we start caring about any other aspect of the modules in the future,
we won't have to rename all these symbols again.

Note: The addition of "depends COMMON_CLOCK" is something that was missing
before, not a new requirement.
