ARM: tegra: split setting of CPU reset handler

Not all Tegra devices can set the CPU reset handler in the same way.
In particular, devices using a TrustZone secure monitor cannot set it
up directly and need to ask the firmware to do it.

This patch separates the act of setting the reset handler from its
preparation, so the former can be implemented in a different way.
