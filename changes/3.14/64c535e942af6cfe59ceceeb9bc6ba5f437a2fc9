sh: sh772[34]: Set serial port sampling rate to 8 for SCIFA ports

SCIFA ports on sh7723 and sh7724 seem to use a sampling rate of half the
value specified in the datasheet. This is currently handled by a custom
baud rate calculation algorithm. The algorithm ID will be removed from
platform data, set the sampling rate directly instead.
