ALSA: hda/hdmi - allow PIN_OUT to be dynamically enabled

Commit 384a48d71520 "ALSA: hda: HDMI: Support codecs with fewer cvts
than pins" dynamically enabled each pin widget's PIN_OUT only when the
pin was actively in use. This was required on certain NVIDIA CODECs for
correct operation. Specifically, if multiple pin widgets each had their
mux input select the same audio converter widget and each pin widget had
PIN_OUT enabled, then only one of the pin widgets would actually receive
the audio, and often not the one the user wanted!

However, this apparently broke some Intel systems, and commit
6169b673618b "ALSA: hda - Always turn on pins for HDMI/DP" reverted the
dynamic setting of PIN_OUT. This in turn broke the afore-mentioned NVIDIA
CODECs.

This change supports either dynamic or static handling of PIN_OUT,
selected by a flag set up during CODEC initialization. This flag is
enabled for all recent NVIDIA GPUs.
