sh_eth: coding style fixes

Running 'scripts/checkpatch.pl' on the driver files gives numerous warnings:

- block comments using empty /* line;

- unneeded \ at end of lines;

- message string split across lines;

- use of __attribute__((aligned(n))) instead of __aligned(n) macro;

- use of __attribute__((packed)) instead of __packed macro.

Additionally, running 'scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict' gives more complaints:

- including the paragraph about writing to FSF into the heading comment;

- alignment not matching open paren;

- multiple assignments on one line;

- use of CamelCase names;

- missing {} on one of the *if* arms where another has them;

- spinlock definition without a comment.

While fixing these, also do some more style cleanups:

- remove useless () around expressions;

- add {} around multi-line *if* operator's arm;

- remove space before comma;

- add spaces after /* and before */;

- properly align continuation lines of broken up expressions;

- realign comments to the structure fields.
