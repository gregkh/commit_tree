btrfs: bootstrap generic btrfs_find_item interface

There are many btrfs functions that manually search the tree for an
item. They all reimplement the same mechanism and differ in the
conditions that they use to find the item. __inode_info() is one such
example. Zach Brown proposed creating a new interface to take the place
of these functions.

This patch is the first step to creating the interface. A new function,
btrfs_find_item, has been added to ctree.c and prototyped in ctree.h.
It is identical to __inode_info, except that the order of the parameters
has been rearranged to more closely those of similar functions elsewhere
in the code (now, root and path come first, then the objectid, offset
and type, and the key to be filled in last). __inode_info's callers have
been set to call this new function instead, and __inode_info itself has
been removed.
