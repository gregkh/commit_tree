ion: Add Kconfig dependency to ARM

The ion code has some very specific arm-isms which keeps it
from building on other architectures. These should probably be
resolved, but in the mean time, add a dependency on CONFIG_ARM
to avoid build failures.

v2: Fix earlier flub, sending out an early untested version of
the patch.
