[media] v4l: ti-vpe: create a color space converter block library

VPE and VIP IPs in DAR7x contain a color space converter(CSC) sub block. Create
a library which will perform CSC related configurations and hold CSC register
definitions. The functions provided by this library will be called by the vpe
and vip drivers using a csc_data handle.

The vpe_dev holds the csc_data handle. The handle represents an instance of the
CSC hardware, and the vpe driver uses it to access the CSC register offsets or
helper functions to configure these registers.

The CSC register offsets are now relative to the CSC block itself, so we need
to use the macro GET_OFFSET_TOP to get the CSC register offset relative to the
VPE IP in the vpe driver.
