beeceem: Fix newline issues at opening braces of conditional statements in InterfaceRx.c

In InterfaceRx.c, opening braces of (if-)conditionals are mostly
dislocated, meaning they are found behind an extra line break after the
conditional statement.  This patch moves the opening braces accordingly
as specified by the official conding style guidelines.
