mm: document improved handling of swappiness==0

Prior to commit fe35004fbf9e ("mm: avoid swapping out with
swappiness==0") setting swappiness to 0, reclaim code could still evict
recently used user anonymous memory to swap even though there is a
significant amount of RAM used for page cache.

The behaviour of setting swappiness to 0 has since changed.  When set,
the reclaim code does not initiate swap until the amount of free pages
and file-backed pages, is less than the high water mark in a zone.

Let's update the documentation to reflect this.
