Staging: vt6656: Combine "else { if" to "else if"

This patch combines single ifs within the block of an else to a single
else if statement.

Therefore code that looks like that

else {
	if (cond) {
		statements;
	} else {
		other_statements;
	}
}

is converted to code that looks like that

else if (cond) {
	statements;
} else {
	other_statements;
}
