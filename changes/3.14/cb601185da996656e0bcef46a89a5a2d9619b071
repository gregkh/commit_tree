ARM: 7927/1: dcache: select DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS for big-endian CPUs

With commit 11ec50caedb5 ("word-at-a-time: provide generic big-endian
zero_bytemask implementation"), the asm-generic word-at-a-time code now
provides a zero_bytemask implementation, allowing us to make use of
DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS on big-endian CPUs, providing our
load_unaligned_zeropad function is endianness-clean.

This patch reworks the load_unaligned_zeropad fixup code to work for
both big- and little-endian CPUs, then removes the !CPU_BIG_ENDIAN check
when selecting DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS.
