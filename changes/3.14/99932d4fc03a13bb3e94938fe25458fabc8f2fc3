netdevice: add queue selection fallback handler for ndo_select_queue

Add a new argument for ndo_select_queue() callback that passes a
fallback handler. This gets invoked through netdev_pick_tx();
fallback handler is currently __netdev_pick_tx() as most drivers
invoke this function within their customized implementation in
case for skbs that don't need any special handling. This fallback
handler can then be replaced on other call-sites with different
queue selection methods (e.g. in packet sockets, pktgen etc).

This also has the nice side-effect that __netdev_pick_tx() is
then only invoked from netdev_pick_tx() and export of that
function to modules can be undone.
