ARM: fix noMMU kallsyms symbol filtering

With noMMU, CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET was not being set correctly.  As there's
no MMU, PAGE_OFFSET should be equal to PHYS_OFFSET in all cases.  This
commit makes that explicit.

Since we do this, we don't need to mess around in asm/memory.h with
ifdefs to sort this out, so let's get rid of that, and there's no point
offering the "Memory split" option for noMMU as that's meaningless
there.
