posix-timers: Cleanup reaped target handling

When a timer's target is seen to be buried, for example on calls
to timer_gettime(), the posix cpu timers code behaves a bit
like a garbage collector and releases early the reference to the
task.

Then again, this optimization complicates the code for no much
value: it's up to the user to release the timer and its associated
ressources by calling timer_delete() after it buries the target
tasks.

Remove this to simplify the code.
