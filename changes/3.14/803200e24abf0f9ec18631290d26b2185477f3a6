uprobes: Don't assume that arch_uprobe->insn/ixol is u8[MAX_UINSN_BYTES]

arch_uprobe should be opaque as much as possible to the generic
code, but currently it assumes that insn/ixol must be u8[] of the
known size. Remove this unnecessary dependency, we can use "&" and
and sizeof() with the same effect.
