drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_pci_ms.c: fix ms card data transfer bug

This patch is used to add support for ms card. The main difference
between ms card and mspro card is long data transfer mode. mspro card
can use auto mode DMA for long data transfer, but ms can not use this
mode, it should use normal mode DMA.

The memstick core added support for ms card, but the original driver will
make ms card fail at initialization, because it uses auto mode DMA.  This
patch makes the ms card work properly.
