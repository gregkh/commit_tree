openvswitch: Per cpu flow stats.

With mega flow implementation ovs flow can be shared between
multiple CPUs which makes stats updates highly contended
operation. This patch uses per-CPU stats in cases where a flow
is likely to be shared (if there is a wildcard in the 5-tuple
and therefore likely to be spread by RSS). In other situations,
it uses the current strategy, saving memory and allocation time.
