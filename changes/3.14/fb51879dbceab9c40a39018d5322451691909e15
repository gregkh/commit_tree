virtio-net: use per-receive queue page frag alloc for mergeable bufs

The virtio-net driver currently uses netdev_alloc_frag() for GFP_ATOMIC
mergeable rx buffer allocations. This commit migrates virtio-net to use
per-receive queue page frags for GFP_ATOMIC allocation. This change unifies
mergeable rx buffer memory allocation, which now will use skb_refill_frag()
for both atomic and GFP-WAIT buffer allocations.

To address fragmentation concerns, if after buffer allocation there
is too little space left in the page frag to allocate a subsequent
buffer, the remaining space is added to the current allocated buffer
so that the remaining space can be used to store packet data.
