        I'm sorry but can you please revert the whole series?
        get_active() waiting while a node is deactivated has potential
        to lead to deadlock and that deactivate/reactivate interface is
        something fundamentally flawed and that cgroup will have to work
        with the remove_self() like everybody else.  IOW, I think the
        first posting was correct.
