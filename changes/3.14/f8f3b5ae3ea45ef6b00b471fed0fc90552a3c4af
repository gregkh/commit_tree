sfc: Correct RX dropped count for drops while interface is down

We don't directly control RX ingress on Siena or any later
controllers, and so we cannot prevent packets from entering the RX
datapath while the RX queues are not set up.  This results in
the hardware incrementing RX_NODESC_DROP_CNT, but it's not an
error and we should not include it in error stats.

When bringing an interface up or down, pull (or wait for) stats and
count the number of packets that were dropped while the interface was
down.  Subtract this from the reported RX dropped count.
