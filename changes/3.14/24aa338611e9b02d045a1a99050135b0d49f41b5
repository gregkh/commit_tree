ocfs2: shift allocation ocfs2_live_connection to user_connect()

We perform this because the DLM recovery callbacks will require the
ocfs2_live_connection structure to record the node information when
dlm_new_lockspace() is updated (in the last patch of the series).

Before calling dlm_new_lockspace(), we need the structure ready for the
.recover_done() callback, which would set oc_this_node.  This is the
reason we allocate ocfs2_live_connection beforehand in user_connect().

[AKPM] rc initialization is not required because it assigned in case of
errors.  It will be cleared by compiler anyways.
