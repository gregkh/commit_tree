openrisc: Rework signal handling

The mainline signal handling code for OpenRISC has been buggy since day
one with respect to syscall restart.  This patch significantly reworks
the signal handling code:

i)   Move the "work pending" loop to C code (borrowed from ARM arch)

ii)  Allow a tracer to muck about with the IP and skip syscall restart
     in that case (again, borrowed from ARM)

iii) Make signal handling WRT syscall restart actually work

v)   Make the signal handling code look more like that of other
     architectures so that it's easier for others to follow
