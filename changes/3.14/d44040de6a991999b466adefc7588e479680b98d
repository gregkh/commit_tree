ath: fix logic on ath_reg_apply_active_scan_flags()

The existing logic removes the passive scan flag from
channels 12 and 13 when a regulatory hint coming from
something other than a country IE has been passed. This
is incorrect, the original intention was to ensure we
always have passive scan enabled for these two channels
for a specific set of custom world regulatory domains.
