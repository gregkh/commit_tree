rwsem: add rwsem_is_contended

Btrfs needs a simple way to know if it needs to let go of it's read lock on a
rwsem.  Introduce rwsem_is_contended to check to see if there are any waiters on
this rwsem currently.  This is just a hueristic, it is meant to be light and not
100% accurate and called by somebody already holding on to the rwsem in either
read or write.  Thanks,
