PCI: Make local functions static

Using 'make namespacecheck' identify code which should be declared static.
Checked for users in other driver/archs as well.  Compile tested only.

This stops exporting the following interfaces to modules:

    pci_target_state()
    pci_load_saved_state()

[bhelgaas: retained pci_find_next_ext_capability() and pci_cfg_space_size()]
