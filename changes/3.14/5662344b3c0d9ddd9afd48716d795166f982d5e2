Btrfs: fix error check of btrfs_lookup_dentry()

Clean up btrfs_lookup_dentry() to never return NULL, but PTR_ERR(-ENOENT)
instead. This keeps the return value convention consistent.

Callers who use btrfs_lookup_dentry() require a trivial update.

create_snapshot() in particular looks like it can also lose a BUG_ON(!inode)
which is not really needed - there seems less harm in returning ENOENT to
userspace at that point in the stack than there is to crash the machine.
