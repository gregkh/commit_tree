Btrfs: change the members' order of btrfs_space_info structure to reduce the cache miss

It is better that the position of the lock is close to the data which is
protected by it, because they may be in the same cache line, we will load
less cache lines when we access them. So we rearrange the members' position
of btrfs_space_info structure to make the lock be closer to the its data.
