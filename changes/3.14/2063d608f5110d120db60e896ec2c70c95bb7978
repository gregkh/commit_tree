kernfs: mark static names with KERNFS_STATIC_NAME

Because sysfs used struct attribute which are supposed to stay
constant, sysfs didn't copy names when creating regular files.  The
specified string for name was supposed to stay constant.  Such
distinction isn't inherent for kernfs.  kernfs_create_file[_ns]()
should be able to take the same @name as kernfs_create_dir[_ns]()

As there can be huge number of sysfs attributes, we still want to be
able to use static names for sysfs attributes.  This patch renames
kernfs_create_file_ns_key() to __kernfs_create_file() and adds
@name_is_static parameter so that the caller can explicitly indicate
that @name can be used without copying.  kernfs is updated to use
KERNFS_STATIC_NAME to distinguish static and copied names.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.
