drm/radeon: Move the early vblank IRQ fixup to radeon_get_crtc_scanoutpos()

i915 doesn't need this kludge for most platforms. Although we do
appear to need something similar on certain platforms, but we can
be more accurate when we apply the adjustment since we know exactly
why the scanline counter doesn't always quite match the vblank
status.

Also the current code doesn't handle interlaced modes correctly,
and we already deal with interlaced modes in i915 code.

So let's just move the current code to radeon_get_crtc_scanoutpos()
since that's why it was added. For i915 we'll add a more finely
targeted variant.
