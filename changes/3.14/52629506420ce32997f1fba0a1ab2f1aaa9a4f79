mm/rmap: use rmap_walk() in try_to_unmap()

Now, we have an infrastructure in rmap_walk() to handle difference from
variants of rmap traversing functions.

So, just use it in try_to_unmap().

In this patch, I change following things.

1. enable rmap_walk() if !CONFIG_MIGRATION.
2. mechanical change to use rmap_walk() in try_to_unmap().
