x86, microcode: Move to a proper location

We've grown a bunch of microcode loader files all prefixed with
"microcode_". They should be under cpu/ because this is strictly
CPU-related functionality so do that and drop the prefix since they're
in their own directory now which gives that prefix. :)

While at it, drop MICROCODE_INTEL_LIB config item and stash the
functionality under CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL as it was its only user.
