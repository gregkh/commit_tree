netfilter: nf_tables: restore chain change atomicity

Chain counter validation is performed after the chain policy has
potentially been changed. Move counter validation/setting before
changing of the chain policy to fix this.

Additionally fix a memory leak if chain counter allocation fails
for new chains, remove an unnecessary free_percpu() and move
counter allocation for new chains
