ipvs: Remove unused variable ret from sync_thread_master()

net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_sync.c: In function 'sync_thread_master':
net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_sync.c:1640:8: warning: unused variable 'ret' [-Wunused-variable]

Commit 35a2af94c7ce7130ca292c68b1d27fcfdb648f6b ("sched/wait: Make the
__wait_event*() interface more friendly") changed how the interruption
state is returned. However, sync_thread_master() ignores this state,
now causing a compile warning.

According to Julian Anastasov <ja@ssi.bg>, this behavior is OK:

    "Yes, your patch looks ok to me. In the past we used ssleep() but IPVS
     users were confused why IPVS threads increase the load average. So, we
     switched to _interruptible calls and later the socket polling was
     added."

Document this, as requested by Peter Zijlstra, to avoid precious developers
disappearing in this pitfall in the future.
