cpufreq: powernow-k8: Initialize per-cpu data-structures properly

The powernow-k8 driver maintains a per-cpu data-structure called
powernow_data that is used to perform the frequency transitions.
It initializes this data structure only for the policy->cpu. So,
accesses to this data structure by other CPUs results in various
problems because they would have been uninitialized.

Specifically, if a cpu (!= policy->cpu) invokes the drivers' ->get()
function, it returns 0 as the KHz value, since its per-cpu memory
doesn't point to anything valid. This causes problems during
suspend/resume since cpufreq_update_policy() tries to enforce this
(0 KHz) as the current frequency of the CPU, and this madness gets
propagated to adjust_jiffies() as well. Eventually, lots of things
start breaking down, including the r8169 ethernet card, in one
particularly interesting case reported by Pierre Ossman.

Fix this by initializing the per-cpu data-structures of all the CPUs
in the policy appropriately.
