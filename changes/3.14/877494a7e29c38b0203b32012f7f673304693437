staging: lustre: reapply an older patch that was reverted

This reapplies part of 9edf0f670bdc8fa8b6676893b0a3bd2bf3 (staging:
lustre: clean up format string usages) as it was reverted in a recent
change to this file.

That proves the big problem of having external trees you have to have
patches flowing back into them from upstream or things break down...
