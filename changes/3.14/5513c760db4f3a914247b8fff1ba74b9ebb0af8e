MIPS: Netlogic: update iomap.h for XLP9XX

Most IO block offsets have changed in XLP9XX. Update iomap.h to add the
new addresses of different SoC blocks like PIC, SYS, UART etc. that are
needed by the base code.

On XLP9xx, the SoC blocks of other nodes are seen on a PCI bus
corresponding to the node. Update iomap code to reflect this.
