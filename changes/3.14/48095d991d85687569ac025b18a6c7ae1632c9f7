audit: Use struct net not pid_t to remember the network namespce to reply in

In struct audit_netlink_list and audit_reply add a reference to the
network namespace of the caller and remove the userspace pid of the
caller.  This cleanly remembers the callers network namespace, and
removes a huge class of races and nasty failure modes that can occur
when attempting to relook up the callers network namespace from a
pid_t (including the caller's network namespace changing, pid
wraparound, and the pid simply not being present).
