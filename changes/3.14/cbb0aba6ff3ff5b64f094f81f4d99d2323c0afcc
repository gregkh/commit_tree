cifs: Add create MFSymlinks to protocol ops struct

Add a new protocol ops function create_mf_symlink and have
create_mf_symlink() use it.

This patchset moves the MFSymlink operations completely to the
ops structure so that we only use the right protocol versions when
querying or creating MFSymlinks.
