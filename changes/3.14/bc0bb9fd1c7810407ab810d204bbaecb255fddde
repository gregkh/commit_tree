The quirk was added as what I'd say was a stopgap measure in

    drm/i915: quirk no PCH_PWM_ENABLE for Dell XPS13 backlight

without really digging into what was going on.

Also, as mentioned in the related bug [1], having the quirk regressed
some of the machines it was supposed to fix to begin with, and there
were patches posted to disable the quirk on such machines [2]!

The fact is, we do need the BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE bit set to have
backlight. With the quirk, we've relied on BIOS to have set it, and our
save/restore code to retain it. With the full backlight setup at enable,
we have no place for things that rely on previous state.

With the per platform hooks, we've also made a change in the PCH
platform enable order: setting the backlight duty cycle between CPU and
PCH PWM enable. Some experimenting and

indicate that we can't set the backlight before enabling CPU PWM; the
value just won't stick. But AFAICT we should do it before enabling the
PCH PWM.

Finally, any fallout we should fix properly, preferrably without quirks,
and absolutely without quirks that rely on existing state. With the per
platform hooks have much more flexibility to adjust the sequence as
required by platforms.
