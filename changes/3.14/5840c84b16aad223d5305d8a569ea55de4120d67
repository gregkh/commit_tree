xen/pvh: Secondary VCPU bringup (non-bootup CPUs)

The VCPU bringup protocol follows the PV with certain twists.
From xen/include/public/arch-x86/xen.h:

Also note that when calling DOMCTL_setvcpucontext and VCPU_initialise
for HVM and PVH guests, not all information in this structure is updated:

 - For HVM guests, the structures read include: fpu_ctxt (if
 VGCT_I387_VALID is set), flags, user_regs, debugreg[*]

 - PVH guests are the same as HVM guests, but additionally use ctrlreg[3] to
 set cr3. All other fields not used should be set to 0.

This is what we do. We piggyback on the 'xen_setup_gdt' - but modify
a bit - we need to call 'load_percpu_segment' so that 'switch_to_new_gdt'
can load per-cpu data-structures. It has no effect on the VCPU0.

We also piggyback on the %rdi register to pass in the CPU number - so
that when we bootup a new CPU, the cpu_bringup_and_idle will have
passed as the first parameter the CPU number (via %rdi for 64-bit).
