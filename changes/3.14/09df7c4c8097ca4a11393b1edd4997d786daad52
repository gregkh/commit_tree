x86: Remove CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE

This was an optimization that made memcpy type benchmarks a little
faster on ancient (Circa 1998) IDT Winchip CPUs.  In real-life
workloads, it wasn't even noticable, and I doubt anyone is running
benchmarks on 16 year old silicon any more.

Given this code has likely seen very little use over the last decade,
let's just remove it.
