Input: synaptics - add manual min/max quirk

The new Lenovo Haswell series (-40's) contains a new Synaptics touchpad.
However, these new Synaptics devices report bad axis ranges.
Under Windows, it is not a problem because the Windows driver uses RMI4
over SMBus to talk to the device. Under Linux, we are using the PS/2
fallback interface and it occurs the reported ranges are wrong.

Of course, it would be too easy to have only one range for the whole
series, each touchpad seems to be calibrated in a different way.

We can not use SMBus to get the actual range because I suspect the firmware
will switch into the SMBus mode and stop talking through PS/2 (this is the
case for hybrid HID over I2C / PS/2 Synaptics touchpads).

So as a temporary solution (until RMI4 land into upstream), start a new
list of quirks with the min/max manually set.
