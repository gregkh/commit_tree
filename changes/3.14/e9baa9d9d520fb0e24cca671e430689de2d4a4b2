dma: ste_dma40: don't dereference free:d descriptor

It appears that in the DMA40 driver the DMA tasklet will very
often dereference memory for a descriptor just free:d from the
DMA40 slab. Nothing happens because no other part of the driver
has yet had a chance to claim this memory, but it's really
nasty to dereference free:d memory, so let's check the flag
before the descriptor is free and store it in a bool variable.
