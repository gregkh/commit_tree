xen/pvh: Early bootup changes in PV code (v4).

We don't use the filtering that 'xen_cpuid' is doing
because the hypervisor treats 'XEN_EMULATE_PREFIX' as
an invalid instruction. This means that all of the filtering
will have to be done in the hypervisor/toolstack.

Without the filtering we expose to the guest the:

 - cpu topology (sockets, cores, etc);
 - the APERF (which the generic scheduler likes to
    use), see  5e626254206a709c6e937f3dda69bf26c7344f6f
    "xen/setup: filter APERFMPERF cpuid feature out"
 - and the inability to figure out whether MWAIT_LEAF
   should be exposed or not. See
   df88b2d96e36d9a9e325bfcd12eb45671cbbc937
   "xen/enlighten: Disable MWAIT_LEAF so that acpi-pad won't be loaded."
 - x2apic, see  4ea9b9aca90cfc71e6872ed3522356755162932c
   "xen: mask x2APIC feature in PV"

We also check for vector callback early on, as it is a required
feature. PVH also runs at default kernel IOPL.

Finally, pure PV settings are moved to a separate function that are
only called for pure PV, ie, pv with pvmmu. They are also #ifdef
with CONFIG_XEN_PVMMU.
