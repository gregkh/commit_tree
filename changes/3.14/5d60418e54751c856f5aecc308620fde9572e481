sysfs, kernfs: introduce kernfs_setattr()

Introduce kernfs setattr interface - kernfs_setattr().

sysfs_sd_setattr() is renamed to __kernfs_setattr() and
kernfs_setattr() is a simple wrapper around it with sysfs_mutex
locking.  sysfs_chmod_file() is updated to get an explicit ref on
kobj->sd and then invoke kernfs_setattr() so that it doesn't have to
use internal interface.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior differences.

v2: Dummy implementation for !CONFIG_SYSFS updated to return -ENOSYS.
