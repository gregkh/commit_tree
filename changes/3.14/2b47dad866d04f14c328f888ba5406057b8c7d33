GFS2: Remember directory insert point

When we look to see if there is enough space to add a dir
entry without allocation, we have then been repeating the
same search later when we do the actual insertion. This
patch caches the details of the location in the gfs2_diradd
structure, so that we do not have to repeat the search.

This will provide a performance improvement which will be
greater as the size of the directory increases.
