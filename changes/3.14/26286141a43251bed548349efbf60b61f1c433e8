perf tools: Fix tags/TAGS targets rebuilding

Once the tags/TAGS file is generated it's never rebuilt until it's
removed by hand.

The reason is that the Makefile does not treat tags/TAGS as targets but
as files and thus won't rebuilt them once they are in place.

Adding PHONY tags/TAGS targets into Makefile.
