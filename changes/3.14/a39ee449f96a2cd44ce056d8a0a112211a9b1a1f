vhost: validate vhost_get_vq_desc return value

vhost fails to validate negative error code
from vhost_get_vq_desc causing
a crash: we are using -EFAULT which is 0xfffffff2
as vector size, which exceeds the allocated size.

The code in question was introduced in commit
8dd014adfea6f173c1ef6378f7e5e7924866c923
