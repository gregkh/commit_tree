tipc: improve naming and comment consistency in media layer

struct 'tipc_media' represents the specific info that the media
layer adaptors (eth_media and ib_media) expose to the generic
bearer layer. We clarify this by improved commenting, and by giving
the 'media_list' array the more appropriate name 'media_info_array'.

There are no functional changes in this commit.
