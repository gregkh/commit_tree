mtd: mxc-nand: kill the NAND_MAX_PAGESIZE/NAND_MAX_OOBSIZE

We kill the NAND_MAX_PAGESIZE/NAND_MAX_OOBSIZE by the following way:
 1.) Before we call the nand_scan_ident, we allocate a temporary buffer
     whose size is PAGE_SIZE.
 2.) After we finish the nand_scan_ident, we have already getten the
     page size and oob size. We will allocate the right buffer size
     again.
