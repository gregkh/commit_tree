sched/deadline: speed up SCHED_DEADLINE pushes with a push-heap

Data from tests confirmed that the original active load balancing
logic didn't scale neither in the number of CPU nor in the number of
tasks (as sched_rt does).

Here we provide a global data structure to keep track of deadlines
of the running tasks in the system. The structure is composed by
a bitmask showing the free CPUs and a max-heap, needed when the system
is heavily loaded.

The implementation and concurrent access scheme are kept simple by
design. However, our measurements show that we can compete with sched_rt
on large multi-CPUs machines [1].

Only the push path is addressed, the extension to use this structure
also for pull decisions is straightforward. However, we are currently
evaluating different (in order to decrease/avoid contention) data
structures to solve possibly both problems. We are also going to re-run
tests considering recent changes inside cpupri [2].
