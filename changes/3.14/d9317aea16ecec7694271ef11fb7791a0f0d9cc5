sfc: Use the correct maximum TX DMA ring size for SFC9100

As part of a workaround for a hardware erratum in the SFC9100 family
(SF bug 35388), the TX_DESC_UPD_DWORD register address is also used
for communicating with the event block, and only descriptor pointer
values < 2048 are valid.

If the TX DMA ring size is increased to 4096 descriptors (which the
firmware still allows) then we may write a descriptor pointer
value >= 2048, which has entirely different and undesirable effects!

Limit the TX DMA ring size correctly when this workaround is in
effect.
