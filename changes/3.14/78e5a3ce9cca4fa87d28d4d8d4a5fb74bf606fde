[media] s5p-jpeg: Reorder quantization tables

Reorder quantization tables so that their elements
are arranged in the manner reflecting compression
quality level that is in accordance with V4L2 documentation,
i.e. the larger value of the V4L2_CID_JPEG_COMPRESSION_QUALITY
control the better image quality, and thus lower compression
quality. The modification allows also to get rid of
reverse logic in the s_ctrl callback while assigning
user space value to the ctx->compr_quality variable.
