dm cache: move hook_info into common portion of per_bio_data structure

Commit c9d28d5d ("dm cache: promotion optimisation for writes")
incorrectly placed the 'hook_info' member in the writethrough-only
portion of the per_bio_data structure.

Given that the overwrite optimization may be used for writeback the
'hook_info' member must be placed above the 'cache' member of the
per_bio_data structure.  Any members above 'cache' are available from
both writeback and writethrough modes' per_bio_data structure.
