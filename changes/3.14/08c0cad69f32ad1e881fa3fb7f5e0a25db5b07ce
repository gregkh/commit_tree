netfilter: nfnetlink_queue: enable UID/GID socket info retrieval

Thanks to commits 41063e9 (ipv4: Early TCP socket demux) and 421b388
(udp: ipv4: Add udp early demux) it is now possible to parse UID and
GID socket info also for incoming TCP and UDP connections. Having
this info available, it is convenient to let NFQUEUE parse it in
order to improve and refine the traffic analysis in userspace.
