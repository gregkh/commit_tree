cgroup: introduce struct cgroup_pidlist_open_file

For pidlist files, seq_file->private pointed to the loaded
cgroup_pidlist; however, pidlist loading is planned to be moved to
cgroup_pidlist_start() for kernfs conversion and seq_file->private
needs to carry more information from open to allow that.

This patch introduces struct cgroup_pidlist_open_file which contains
type, cgrp and pidlist and updates pidlist seq_file->private to point
to it using seq_open_private() and seq_release_private().  Note that
this eventually will be replaced by kernfs_open_file.

While this patch makes more information available to seq_file
operations, they don't use it yet and this patch doesn't introduce any
behavior changes except for allocation of the extra private struct.

v2: use __seq_open_private() instead of seq_open_private() for brevity
    as suggested by Li.
