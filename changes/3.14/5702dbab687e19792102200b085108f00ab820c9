tipc: initiate media type array at compile time

Communication media types are abstracted through the struct 'tipc_media',
one per media type. These structs are allocated statically inside their
respective media file.

Furthermore, in order to be able to reach all instances from a central
location, we keep a static array with pointers to these structs. This
array is currently initialized at runtime, under protection of
tipc_net_lock. However, since the contents of the array itself never
changes after initialization, we can just as well initialize it at
compile time and make it 'const', at the same time making it obvious
that no lock protection is needed here.

This commit makes the array constant and removes the redundant lock
protection.
