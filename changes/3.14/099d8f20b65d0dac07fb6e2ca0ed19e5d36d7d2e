iwlwifi: mvm: send all the NVM sections to the NIC

Some NIC comes with more than the 4 NVM (non volative
memory) sections described in the nvm_to_read array.
These NICs usually get their NVM from an external file
fetched from userland during init.
We already parsed the file, but sent to the NIC only 4 NVM
sections whereas there could be more sections in the file.
Fix this.
