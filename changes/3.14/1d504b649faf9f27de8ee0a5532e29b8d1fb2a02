[media] media: st-rc: Add reset support

Some of the SOCs hold the IRB IP in softreset state by default.
For this IP to work driver needs to bring it out of softreset.
This patch adds support to reset the IP via reset framework.

Without this patch the driver can not work with SoCs which holds the IP
in softreset.
