iwlwifi: mvm: fix ht protection flags

The HT protection flags have been a mess for a long time,
this patch fixes all this.

The proper source of information for this is the
protection in the HT operation mode IE which is
propagated to bss_conf by mac80211.

1) No need to set the HT protection flags when the link
   doesn't support HT.
2) We need to set the TGG protection when ERP is active.
