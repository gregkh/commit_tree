ASoC: fsl_ssi: Add DAI master mode support for SSI on i.MX series

This patch adds three main functions for DAI master mode: set_dai_fmt(),
set_dai_sysclk() and set_dai_tdm_slot(), and one essential baud clock
accordingly. After appending this patch, the fsl_ssi driver on i.MX series
has the ability to derive LRCLK and BCLK from baud clock source so as to
support some audio Codecs which can only be used in slave mode.
