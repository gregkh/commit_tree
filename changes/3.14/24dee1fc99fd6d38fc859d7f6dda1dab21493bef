ACPI / bind: Pass struct acpi_device pointer to acpi_bind_one()

There is no reason to pass an ACPI handle to acpi_bind_one() instead
of a struct acpi_device pointer to the target device object, so
modify that function to take a struct acpi_device pointer as its
second argument and update all code depending on it accordingly.
