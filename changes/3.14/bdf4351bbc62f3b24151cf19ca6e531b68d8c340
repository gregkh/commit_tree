bridge: Remove unnecessary vlan_put_tag in br_handle_vlan

br_handle_vlan() pushes HW accelerated vlan tag into skbuff when outgoing
port is the bridge device.
This is unnecessary because __netif_receive_skb_core() can handle skbs
with HW accelerated vlan tag. In current implementation,
__netif_receive_skb_core() needs to extract the vlan tag embedded in skb
data. This could cause low network performance especially when receiving
frames at a high frame rate on the bridge device.
