[media] em28xx-audio: don't wait for lock in non-block mode

Pulseaudio has the bad habit of stopping a streaming audio if
a device, opened in non-block mode, waits.

It is impossible to avoid em28xx to wait, as it will send commands
via I2C, and other I2C operations may be happening (firmware
transfers, Remote Controller polling, etc). Yet, as each em28xx
subdriver locks em28xx-dev to protect the access to the hardware,
it is possible to minimize the audio glitches by returning -EAGAIN
to pulseaudio, if the lock is already taken by another subdriver.
