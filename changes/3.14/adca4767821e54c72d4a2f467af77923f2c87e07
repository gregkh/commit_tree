net: Improve SO_TIMESTAMPING documentation and fix a minor code bug

The original documentation was very unclear.

The code fix is presumably related to the formerly unclear
documentation: SOCK_TIMESTAMPING_RX_SOFTWARE has no effect on
__sock_recv_timestamp's behavior, so calling __sock_recv_ts_and_drops
from sock_recv_ts_and_drops if only SOCK_TIMESTAMPING_RX_SOFTWARE is
set is pointless.  This should have no user-observable effect.
