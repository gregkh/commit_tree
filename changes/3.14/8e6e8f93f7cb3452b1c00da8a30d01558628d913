[media] V4L: Add mem2mem ioctl and file operation helpers

This patch adds ioctl helpers to the V4L2 mem-to-mem API, so we can avoid
several ioctl handlers in the mem-to-mem video node drivers that are simply
a pass-through to the v4l2_m2m_* calls. These helpers will only be useful
for drivers that use same mutex for both OUTPUT and CAPTURE queue, which
is the case for all currently in tree v4l2 m2m drivers. In order to use
the helpers the drivers are required to use struct v4l2_fh.
