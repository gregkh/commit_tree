asm/types.h: Remove include/asm-generic/int-l64.h

Now all 64-bit architectures have been converted to int-ll64.h, we can
remove int-l64.h in kernelspace.

For backwards compatibility, alpha, ia64, mips64, and powerpc64 still
use int-l64.h in userspace.

This is the (reworked for UAPI) non-documentation part of more than two
year old "asm/types.h: All architectures use int-ll64.h in kernelspace"
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/8/13/104)

Since <asm/types.h> (from include/uapi/asm-generic/types.h) is used for
both kernel and user space, include/asm-generic/int-ll64.h cannot just
become include/asm-generic/types.h, as Arnd suggested.
