PCI: mvebu: Use Device ID and revision from underlying endpoint

Marvell SoCs place the SoC number into the PCIe endpoint device ID.  The
SoC stepping is placed into the PCIe revision. The old plat-orion PCIe
driver allowed this information to be seen in user space with a simple
lspci command.

The new driver places a virtual PCI-PCI bridge on top of these endpoints.
It has its own hard coded PCI device ID. Thus it is no longer possible to
see what the SoC is using lspci.

When initializing the PCI-PCI bridge, set its device ID and revision from
the underlying endpoint, thus restoring this functionality.  Debian would
like to use this in order to aid installing the correct DTB file.
