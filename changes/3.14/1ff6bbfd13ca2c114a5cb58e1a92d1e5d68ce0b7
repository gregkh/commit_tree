arm, pm, vmpressure: add missing slab.h includes

arch/arm/mach-tegra/pm.c, kernel/power/console.c and mm/vmpressure.c
were somehow getting slab.h indirectly through cgroup.h which in turn
was getting it indirectly through xattr.h.  A scheduled cgroup change
drops xattr.h inclusion from cgroup.h and breaks compilation of these
three files.  Add explicit slab.h includes to the three files.

A pending cgroup patch depends on this change and it'd be great if
this can be routed through cgroup/for-3.14-fixes branch.
