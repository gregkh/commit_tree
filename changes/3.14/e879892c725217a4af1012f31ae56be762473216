KVM: s390: Always store status during SIGP STOP_AND_STORE_STATUS

The SIGP order STOP_AND_STORE_STATUS is defined to stop a CPU and store
its status. However, we only stored the status if the CPU was still
running, so make sure that the status is now also stored if the CPU was
already stopped. This fixes the problem that the CPU information was
not stored correctly in kdump files, rendering them unreadable.
