HID: sony: Rename rumble_* functions/variables to state_*

The commands used to modify the rumble motor state also modifies the LEDs at
the same time. The functionality used to modify this state in the driver has to
be shared between the rumble and LED part. It is therefore better to replace
the "rumble" part of the names with "state".
