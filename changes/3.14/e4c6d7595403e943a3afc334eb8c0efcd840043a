openvswitch: Fix ovs_flow_free() ovs-lock assert.

ovs_flow_free() is not called under ovs-lock during packet
execute path (ovs_packet_cmd_execute()). Since packet execute
does not touch flow->mask, there is no need to take that
lock either. So move assert in case where flow->mask is checked.

Found by code inspection.
