xen/events: bind all new interdomain events to VCPU0

Commit fc087e10734a4d3e40693fc099461ec1270b3fff (xen/events: remove
unnecessary init_evtchn_cpu_bindings()) causes a regression.

The kernel-side VCPU binding was not being correctly set for newly
allocated or bound interdomain events.  In ARM guests where 2-level
events were used, this would result in no interdomain events being
handled because the kernel-side VCPU masks would all be clear.

x86 guests would work because the irq affinity was set during irq
setup and this would set the correct kernel-side VCPU binding.

Fix this by properly initializing the kernel-side VCPU binding in
bind_evtchn_to_irq().
