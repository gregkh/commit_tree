KVM: PPC: Store FP/VSX/VMX state in thread_fp/vr_state structures

This uses struct thread_fp_state and struct thread_vr_state to store
the floating-point, VMX/Altivec and VSX state, rather than flat arrays.
This makes transferring the state to/from the thread_struct simpler
and allows us to unify the get/set_one_reg implementations for the
VSX registers.
