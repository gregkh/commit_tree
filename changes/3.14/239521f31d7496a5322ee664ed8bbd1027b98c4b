ipc: whitespace cleanup

The ipc code does not adhere the typical linux coding style.
This patch fixes lots of simple whitespace errors.

- mostly autogenerated by
  scripts/checkpatch.pl -f --fix \
	--types=pointer_location,spacing,space_before_tab
- one manual fixup (keep structure members tab-aligned)
- removal of additional space_before_tab that were not found by --fix

Tested with some of my msg and sem test apps.

Andrew: Could you include it in -mm and move it towards Linus' tree?
