dm thin: cleanup and improve no space handling

Factor out_of_data_space() out of alloc_data_block().  Eliminate the use
of 'no_free_space' as a latch in alloc_data_block() -- this is no longer
needed now that we switch to read-only mode when we run out of data or
metadata space.  In a later patch, the 'no_free_space' flag will be
eliminated entirely (in favor of checking metadata rather than relying
on a transient flag).

Move no metdata space handling into metdata_operation_failed().  Set
no_free_space when metadata space is exhausted too.  This is useful,
because it offers consistency, for the following patch that will requeue
data IOs if no_free_space.

Also, rename no_space() to retry_bios_on_resume().
