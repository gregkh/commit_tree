PCI: Remove unused pci_vpd_truncate()

My philosophy is unused code is dead code.  And dead code is subject to bit
rot and is a likely source of bugs.  Use it or lose it.

This reverts db5679437a2b ("PCI: add interface to set visible size of
VPD"), removing this interface:

    pci_vpd_truncate()

[bhelgaas: split to separate patch, also remove prototype from pci.h]
