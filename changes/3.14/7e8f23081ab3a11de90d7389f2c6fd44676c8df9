f2fs: remove the rw_flag domain from f2fs_io_info

When using the f2fs_io_info in the low level, we still need to merge the
rw and rw_flag, so use the rw to hold all the io flags directly,
and remove the rw_flag field.

ps.It is based on the previous patch:
f2fs: move all the bio initialization into __bio_alloc
