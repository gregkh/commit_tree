batman-adv: avoid potential race condition when adding a new neighbour

When adding a new neighbour it is important to atomically
perform the following:
- check if the neighbour already exists
- append the neighbour to the proper list

If the two operations are not performed in an atomic context
it is possible that two concurrent insertions add the same
neighbour twice.
