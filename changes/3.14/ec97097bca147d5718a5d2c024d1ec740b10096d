mm: vmscan: call NUMA-unaware shrinkers irrespective of nodemask

If a shrinker is not NUMA-aware, shrink_slab() should call it exactly
once with nid=0, but currently it is not true: if node 0 is not set in
the nodemask or if it is not online, we will not call such shrinkers at
all.  As a result some slabs will be left untouched under some
circumstances.  Let us fix it.
