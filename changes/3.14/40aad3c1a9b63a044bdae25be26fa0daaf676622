dt/bindings: Remove all references to device_type "ethernet-phy"

The device_type property is deprecated for the flattened device tree and
the value "ethernet-phy" has never been defined as having a useful
meaning. Neither the kernel nor u-boot depend on it. It should never
have appeared in PHY bindings. This patch removes all references to
"ethernet-phy" as a device_type value from the documentation and the
.dts files.

This patch was generated mechanically with the following command and
then verified by looking at the diff.

sed -i '/"ethernet-phy"/d' `git grep -l '"ethernet-phy"'`
