x86/mm/pageattr: Add a PUD pagetable populating function

Add the next level of the pagetable populating function, we handle
chunks around a 1G boundary by mapping them with the lower level
functions - otherwise we use 1G pages for the mappings, thus using as
less amount of pagetable pages as possible.
