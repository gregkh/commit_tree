clk: nomadik: fix multiplatform problem

The Nomadik debugfs screws up multiplatform boots if debugfs
is enabled on the multiplatform image, since it's a simple
initcall that is unconditionally executed and reads from certain
memory locations.

Fix this by checking that the driver has been properly
initialized, so a base offset to the Nomadik SRC controller
exists, before proceeding to register debugfs files.
