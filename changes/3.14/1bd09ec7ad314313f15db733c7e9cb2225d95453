drm/i915: Avoid underruns when disabling sprites

As the watermark registers aren't double bufferd, clearing the
watermarks immediately after writing the sprite registers can be
hazardous.

Until we have something better, add a wait for vblank between the
two steps to make sure the sprite no longer needs the watermark
levels before we clear them.
