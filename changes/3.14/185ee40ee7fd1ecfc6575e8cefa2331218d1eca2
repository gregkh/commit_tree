fs/proc/array.c: change do_task_stat() to use while_each_thread()

Change the remaining next_thread (ab)users to use while_each_thread().

The last user which should be changed is next_tid(), but we can't do this
now.

__exit_signal() and complete_signal() are fine, they actually need
next_thread() logic.

This patch (of 3):

do_task_stat() can use while_each_thread(), no changes in
the compiled code.
