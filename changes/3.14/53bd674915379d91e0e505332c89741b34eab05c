ipv6 addrconf: introduce IFA_F_MANAGETEMPADDR to tell kernel to manage temporary addresses

Creating an address with this flag set will result in kernel taking care
of temporary addresses in the same way as if the address was created by
kernel itself (after RA receive). This allows userspace applications
implementing the autoconfiguration (NetworkManager for example) to
implement ipv6 addresses privacy.
