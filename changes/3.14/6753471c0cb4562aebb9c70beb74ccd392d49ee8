blk-mq: uses page->list incorrectly

'struct page' has two list_head fields: 'lru' and 'list'.  Conveniently,
they are unioned together.  This means that code can use them
interchangably, which gets horribly confusing.

The blk-mq made the logical decision to try to use page->list.  But, that
field was actually introduced just for the slub code.  ->lru is the right
field to use outside of slab/slub.
