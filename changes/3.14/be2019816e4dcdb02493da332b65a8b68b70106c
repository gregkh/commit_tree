powerpc/embedded6xx: Add support for Motorola/Emerson MVME5100

Add support for the Motorola/Emerson MVME5100 Single Board Computer.

The MVME5100 is a 6U form factor VME64 computer with:

	- A single MPC7410 or MPC750 CPU
	- A HAWK Processor Host Bridge (CPU to PCI) and
	  MultiProcessor Interrupt Controller (MPIC)
	- Up to 500Mb of onboard memory
	- A M48T37 Real Time Clock (RTC) and Non-Volatile Memory chip
	- Two 16550 compatible UARTS
	- Two Intel E100 Fast Ethernets
	- Two PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC) Slots
	- PPCBug Firmware

The HAWK PHB/MPIC is compatible with the MPC10x devices.

There is no onboard disk support. This is usually provided by installing a PMC
in first PMC slot.

This patch revives the board support, it was present in early 2.6
series kernels. The board support in those days was by Matt Porter of
MontaVista Software.

CSC Australia has around 31 of these boards in service. The kernel in use
for the boards is based on 2.6.31. The boards are operated without disks
from a file server.

This patch is based on linux-3.13-rc2 and has been boot tested.

Only boards with 512 Mb of memory are known to work.
