mm: numa: limit scope of lock for NUMA migrate rate limiting

NUMA migrate rate limiting protects a migration counter and window using
a lock but in some cases this can be a contended lock.  It is not
critical that the number of pages be perfect, lost updates are
acceptable.  Reduce the importance of this lock.
