retrieving CIFS ACLs when mounted with SMB2 fails dropping session

The get/set ACL xattr support for CIFS ACLs attempts to send old
cifs dialect protocol requests even when mounted with SMB2 or later
dialects. Sending cifs requests on an smb2 session causes problems -
the server drops the session due to the illegal request.

This patch makes CIFS ACL operations protocol specific to fix that.

Attempting to query/set CIFS ACLs for SMB2 will now return
EOPNOTSUPP (until we add worker routines for sending query
ACL requests via SMB2) instead of sending invalid (cifs)
requests.

A separate followon patch will be needed to fix cifs_acl_to_fattr
(which takes a cifs specific u16 fid so can't be abstracted
to work with SMB2 until that is changed) and will be needed
to fix mount problems when "cifsacl" is specified on mount
with e.g. vers=2.1
