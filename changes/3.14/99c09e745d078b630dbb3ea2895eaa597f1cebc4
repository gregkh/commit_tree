drm: remove dev->vma_count

This is just used for a debugfs file, and we can easily reconstruct
this number by just walking the list twice. Which isn't really bad for
a debugfs file anyway.

So let's rip this out.

There's the other issue that the dev->vmalist itself is a bit useless,
since that can be reconstructed with all the memory mapping
information from proc. But remove that is a different topic entirely.
