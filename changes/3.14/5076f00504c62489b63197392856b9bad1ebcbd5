ACPICA: Debug output: Fix a couple of small output issues.

1) Fix utcache to use the proper return macros in order to maintain
the function nesting level.

2) Enable the function nesting level for all ACPI applications instead
of just acpiexec.

Linux kernel behaviour is not affected by this patch as Linux doesn't
use ACPICA object cache mechanism currently.
