KVM: nVMX: Leave VMX mode on clearing of feature control MSR

When userspace sets MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL to 0, make sure we leave
root and non-root mode, fully disabling VMX. The register state of the
VCPU is undefined after this step, so userspace has to set it to a
proper state afterward.

This enables to reboot a VM while it is running some hypervisor code.
