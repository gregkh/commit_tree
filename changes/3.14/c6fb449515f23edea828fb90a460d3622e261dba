sysfs, kernfs: prepare open, release, poll paths for kernfs

We're in the process of separating out core sysfs functionality into
kernfs which will deal with sysfs_dirents directly.  This patch
prepares the rest - open, release and poll.  There isn't much to do.
Just renaming is enough.  As sysfs_file_operations and
sysfs_bin_operations are identical now, use the same file_operations
for both - kernfs_file_operations.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.
