math-emu: fix floating-point to integer unsigned saturation

The math-emu macros _FP_TO_INT and _FP_TO_INT_ROUND are supposed to
saturate their results for out-of-range arguments, except in the case
rsigned == 2 (when instead the low bits of the result are taken).
However, in the case rsigned == 0 (converting to unsigned integers),
they mistakenly produce 0 for positive results and the maximum
unsigned integer for negative results, the opposite of correct
unsigned saturation.  This patch fixes the logic.
