KVM: nVMX: Add support for activity state HLT

We can easily emulate the HLT activity state for L1: If it decides that
L2 shall be halted on entry, just invoke the normal emulation of halt
after switching to L2. We do not depend on specific host features to
provide this, so we can expose the capability unconditionally.
