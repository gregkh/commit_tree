ipc: delete seq_max field in struct ipc_ids

This field is only used to reset the ids seq number if it exceeds the
smaller of INT_MAX/SEQ_MULTIPLIER and USHRT_MAX, and can therefore be
moved out of the structure and into its own macro.  Since each
ipc_namespace contains a table of 3 pointers to struct ipc_ids we can
save space in instruction text:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  56232    2348      24   58604    e4ec ipc/built-in.o
  56216    2348      24   58588    e4dc ipc/built-in.o-after
