perf evsel: Skip ignored symbols while printing callchain

Allows a command to have a symbol_filter controlled by the user to skip
certain functions in a backtrace. One example is to allow the user to
reduce repeating patterns like:

    do_select  core_sys_select  sys_select

to just sys_select when dumping callchains, consuming less real estate
on the screen while still conveying the essential message - the process
is in a select call.

This option is leveraged by the upcoming timehist command.
