dm thin: add error_if_no_space feature

If the pool runs out of data or metadata space, the pool can either
queue or error the IO destined to the data device.  The default is to
queue the IO until more space is added.

An admin may now configure the pool to error IO when no space is
available by setting the 'error_if_no_space' feature when loading the
thin-pool table.
