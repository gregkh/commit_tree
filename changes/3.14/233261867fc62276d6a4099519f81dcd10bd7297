i40e: rtnl_lock in reset path fixes

Any user-initiated path which eventually calls reset needs
to hold the rtnl_lock, so add functionality to do that.

Be careful not to use the safe reset when cleaning up
from the diagnostic tests, which avoids rtnl_lock
recursion from ethtool.

Protect the reset_task with rtnl_lock, since it runs from a work item.
