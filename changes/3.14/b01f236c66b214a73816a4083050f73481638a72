team: block mtu change before it happens via NETDEV_PRECHANGEMTU

Now it catches the NETDEV_CHANGEMTU notification, which is signaled after
the actual change happened on the device, and returns NOTIFY_BAD, so that
the change on the device is reverted.

This might be quite costly and messy, so use the new NETDEV_PRECHANGEMTU to
catch the MTU change before the actual change happens and signal that it's
forbidden to do it.
