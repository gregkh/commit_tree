mm/memory_hotplug.c: move register_memory_resource out of the lock_memory_hotplug

We don't need to do register_memory_resource() under
lock_memory_hotplug() since it has its own lock and doesn't make any
callbacks.

Also register_memory_resource return NULL on failure so we don't have
anything to cleanup at this point.

The reason for this rfc is I was doing some experiments with hotplugging
of memory on some of our larger systems.  While it seems to work, it can
be quite slow.  With some preliminary digging I found that
lock_memory_hotplug is clearly ripe for breakup.

It could be broken up per nid or something but it also covers the
online_page_callback.  The online_page_callback shouldn't be very hard
to break out.

Also there is the issue of various structures(wmarks come to mind) that
are only updated under the lock_memory_hotplug that would need to be
dealt with.
