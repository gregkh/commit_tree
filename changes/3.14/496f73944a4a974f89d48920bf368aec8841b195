sysfs, kernfs: introduce kernfs_create_file[_ns]()

Introduce kernfs interface to create a file which takes and returns
sysfs_dirents.

The actual file creation part is separated out from
sysfs_add_file_mode_ns() into kernfs_create_file_ns().  The former now
only decides the kernfs_ops to use and the file's size and invokes the
latter.

This patch doesn't introduce behavior changes.

v2: Dummy implementation for !CONFIG_SYSFS updated to return -ENOSYS.
