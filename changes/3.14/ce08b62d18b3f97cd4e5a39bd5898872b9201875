change close_files() to use rcu_dereference_raw(files->fdt)

put_files_struct() and close_files() do rcu_read_lock() to make
rcu_dereference_check_fdtable() happy.

This looks a bit ugly, files_fdtable() just reads the pointer,
we can simply use rcu_dereference_raw() to avoid the warning.

The patch also changes close_files() to return fdt, this avoids
another rcu_read_lock()/files_fdtable() in put_files_struct().

I think close_files() needs more cleanups:

	- we do not need xchg() exactly because we are the last
	  user of this files_struct

	- "if (file)" should be turned into WARN_ON(!file)
