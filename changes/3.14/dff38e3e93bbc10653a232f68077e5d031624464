x86: Use inline assembler instead of global register variable to get sp

LTO in gcc 4.6/47. has trouble with global register variables. They were used
to read the stack pointer. Use a simple inline assembler statement with
a mov instead.

This also helps LLVM/clang, which does not support global register
variables.

[ hpa: Ideally this should become a builtin in both gcc and clang. ]

v2: More general asm constraint. Fix description (Jan Beulich)
