ALSA: compress: Pass through return value of open ops callback

The snd_compr_open function would always return 0 even if the compressed
ops open function failed, obviously this is incorrect. Looks like this
was introduced by a small typo in:

commit a0830dbd4e42b38aefdf3fb61ba5019a1a99ea85
ALSA: Add a reference counter to card instance

This patch returns the value from the compressed op as it should.
