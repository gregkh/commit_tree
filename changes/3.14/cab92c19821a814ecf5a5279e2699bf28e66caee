NFSv4: Fix a slot leak in nfs40_sequence_done

The check for whether or not we sent an RPC call in nfs40_sequence_done
is insufficient to decide whether or not we are holding a session slot,
and thus should not be used to decide when to free that slot.

This patch replaces the RPC_WAS_SENT() test with the correct test for
whether or not slot == NULL.
