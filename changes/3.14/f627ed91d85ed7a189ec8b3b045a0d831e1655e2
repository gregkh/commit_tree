netfilter: nf_tables: check if payload length is a power of 2

Add a check if payload's length is a power of 2 when selecting ops.
The fast ops were meant for well aligned loads, also this fixes a
small bug when using a length of 3 with some offsets which causes
only 1 byte to be loaded because the fast ops are chosen.
