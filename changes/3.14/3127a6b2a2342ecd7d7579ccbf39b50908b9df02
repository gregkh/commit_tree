pci: tegra: use reset framework

Tegra's clock driver now provides an implementation of the common
reset API (include/linux/reset.h). Use this instead of the old Tegra-
specific API; that will soon be removed.

The old Tegra-specific API used a struct clock to represent the module
to reset. Some of the clocks retrieved during probe() were only used for
reset purposes, and indeed aren't even true clocks. So, there's no need
to get() them any more.
