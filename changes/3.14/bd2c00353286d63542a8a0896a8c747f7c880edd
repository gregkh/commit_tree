hfsplus: fix remount issue

Current implementation of HFS+ driver has small issue with remount
option.  Namely, for example, you are unable to remount from RO mode
into RW mode by means of command "mount -o remount,rw /dev/loop0
/mnt/hfsplus".  Trying to execute sequence of commands results in an
error message:

  mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/hfsplus
  mount -o remount,ro /dev/loop0 /mnt/hfsplus
  mount -o remount,rw /dev/loop0 /mnt/hfsplus

  mount: you must specify the filesystem type

  mount -t hfsplus -o remount,rw /dev/loop0 /mnt/hfsplus

  mount: /mnt/hfsplus not mounted or bad option

The reason of such issue is failure of mount syscall:

  mount("/dev/loop0", "/mnt/hfsplus", 0x2282a60, MS_MGC_VAL|MS_REMOUNT, NULL) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)

Namely, hfsplus_parse_options_remount() method receives empty "input"
argument and return false in such case.  As a result, hfsplus_remount()
returns -EINVAL error code.

This patch fixes the issue by means of return true for the case of empty
"input" argument in hfsplus_parse_options_remount() method.
