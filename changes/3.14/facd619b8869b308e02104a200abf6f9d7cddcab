drm/i915: Fix LP1+ watermark disabling ILK

On ILK disabling LP1+ watermarks must be done carefully to avoid
underruns. If we just write 0 to the register in the middle of the scan
cycle we often get an underrun. So instead we have to leave the actual
watermark levels in the register intact, and just toggle the enable bit.

Presumably the hardware takes a while to get out of low power mode, and
so the watermark level need to stay valid until that time.

We also have to be careful with the WM1S_LP_EN bit. It seems the
hardware more or less treats it like the actual watermarks numbers, and
so we must not toggle it too soon. Just leave it alone when disabling
the LP1+ watermarks.
