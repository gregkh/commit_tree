arm64: fix build error if DMA_CMA is enabled

arm64/include/asm/dma-contiguous.h is trying to include
<asm-genric/dma-contiguous.h> which does not exist, and thus failing
build for arm64 if we enable CONFIG_DMA_CMA. This patch fixes build
error by removing unwanted header inclusion from arm64's dma-contiguous.h.
