ASoC: ux500_pcm: Expect different saved DMA data when obtaining from DAI store

In preparation for full Device Tree enablement we must differentiate
between the two varying ways DMA data can be held in the DAI store. If
we're booting with Device Tree the provided 'snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data'
data structure shall be used, whereas in order to avoid breaking legacy
platform data we also need to be able to translate DMA data stored using
the UX500 specific 'ux500_msp_dma_params' method.

Once we move over to solely use Device Tree, we can enforce the use of
'snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data' and this code can be removed altogether.
