scripts/kernel-doc: make unknown function prototype a Warning instead of an Error

When scripts/kernel-doc cannot understand a function prototype,
it had been generating a fatal error and stopping immediately.
Make this a Warning instead of an Error and keep going.

Note that this can happen if the kernel-doc notation that is being
parsed is not actually a function prototype; maybe it's a struct or
something else, so I added "function" to the warning message to try
to make it clearer that scripts/kernel-doc is looking for a function
prototype here.
