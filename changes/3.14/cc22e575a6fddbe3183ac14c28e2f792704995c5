perf symbols: Add 'machine' member to struct addr_location

The addr_location struct should fully qualify an address, and to do that
it should have in it the machine where the thread was found.

Thus all functions that receive an addr_location now don't need to also
receive a 'machine', those functions just need to access al->machine
instead, just like it does with the other parts of an address location:
al->thread, al->map, etc.
