Revert "of: search the best compatible match first in __of_match_node()"

This reverts commit 06b29e76a74b2373e6f8b5a7938b3630b9ae98b2.
As pointed out by Grant Likely, we should also take the type and name
into account when searching the best compatible match. That means the
match with compatible, type and name should be better than the match
just with the same compatible string. So revert this and we will
implement another method to find the best match entry.
