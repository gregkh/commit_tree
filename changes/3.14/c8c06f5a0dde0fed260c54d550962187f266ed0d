powerpc/mm: Free up _PAGE_COHERENCE for numa fault use later

Set  memory coherence always on hash64 config. If
a platform cannot have memory coherence always set they
can infer that from _PAGE_NO_CACHE and _PAGE_WRITETHRU
like in lpar. So we dont' really need a separate bit
for tracking _PAGE_COHERENCE.
