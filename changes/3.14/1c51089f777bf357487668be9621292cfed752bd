powerpc/book3s: Return from interrupt if coming from evil context.

We can get machine checks from any context. We need to make sure that
we handle all of them correctly. If we are coming from hypervisor user-space,
we can continue in host kernel in virtual mode to deliver the MC event.
If we got woken up from power-saving mode then we may come in with one of
the following state:
 a. No state loss
 b. Supervisor state loss
 c. Hypervisor state loss
For (a) and (b), we go back to nap again. State (c) is fatal, keep spinning.

For all other context which we not sure of queue up the MCE event and return
from the interrupt.
