sysfs, kernfs: add kernfs_ops->seq_{start|next|stop}()

kernfs_ops currently only supports single_open() behavior which is
pretty restrictive.  Add optional callbacks ->seq_{start|next|stop}()
which, when implemented, are invoked for seq_file traversal.  This
allows full seq_file functionality for kernfs users.  This currently
doesn't have any user and doesn't change any behavior.

v2: Refreshed on top of the updated "sysfs, kernfs: prepare read path
    for kernfs".
