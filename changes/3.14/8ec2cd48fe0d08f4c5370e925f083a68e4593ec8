net: mvneta: convert to build_skb()

Make use of build_skb() to allocate frags on the RX path. When frag size
is lower than a page size, we can use netdev_alloc_frag(), and we fall back
to kmalloc() for larger sizes. The frag size is stored into the mvneta_port
struct. The alloc/free functions check the frag size to decide what alloc/
free method to use. MTU changes are safe because the MTU change function
stops the device and clears the queues before applying the change.

With this patch, I observed a reproducible 2% performance improvement on
HTTP-based benchmarks, and 5% on small packet RX rate.
