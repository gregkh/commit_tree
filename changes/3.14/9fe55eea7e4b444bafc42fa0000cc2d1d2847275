Fix race when checking i_size on direct i/o read

So far I've had one ACK for this, and no other comments. So I think it
is probably time to send this via some suitable tree. I'm guessing that
the vfs tree would be the most appropriate route, but not sure that
there is one at the moment (don't see anything recent at kernel.org)
so in that case I think -mm is the "back up plan". Al, please let me
know if you will take this?

---------------------

Following on from the "Re: [PATCH v3] vfs: fix a bug when we do some dio
reads with append dio writes" thread on linux-fsdevel, this patch is my
current version of the fix proposed as option (b) in that thread.

Removing the i_size test from the direct i/o read path at vfs level
means that filesystems now have to deal with requests which are beyond
i_size themselves. These I've divided into three sets:

 a) Those with "no op" ->direct_IO (9p, cifs, ceph)
These are obviously not going to be an issue

 b) Those with "home brew" ->direct_IO (nfs, fuse)
I've been told that NFS should not have any problem with the larger
i_size, however I've added an extra test to FUSE to duplicate the
original behaviour just to be on the safe side.

 c) Those using __blockdev_direct_IO()
These call through to ->get_block() which should deal with the EOF
condition correctly. I've verified that with GFS2 and I believe that
Zheng has verified it for ext4. I've also run the test on XFS and it
passes both before and after this change.

The part of the patch in filemap.c looks a lot larger than it really is
- there are only two lines of real change. The rest is just indentation
of the contained code.

There remains a test of i_size though, which was added for btrfs. It
doesn't cause the other filesystems a problem as the test is performed
after ->direct_IO has been called. It is possible that there is a race
that does matter to btrfs, however this patch doesn't change that, so
its still an overall improvement.
