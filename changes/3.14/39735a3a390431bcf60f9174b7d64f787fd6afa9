ARM/KVM: save and restore generic timer registers

For migration to work we need to save (and later restore) the state of
each core's virtual generic timer.
Since this is per VCPU, we can use the [gs]et_one_reg ioctl and export
the three needed registers (control, counter, compare value).
Though they live in cp15 space, we don't use the existing list, since
they need special accessor functions and the arch timer is optional.
