staging: comedi: pcmmio: cleanup the private data

Fix the types of some of the private data members. The 'enabled_mask' and
'stop_count' should be unsigned int values. The 'active' and 'continuous'
members are flags, change them to unsigned int bit fields.

Remove the 'sprivs' pointer. This should have been removed when the subdevice
private data was removed.
