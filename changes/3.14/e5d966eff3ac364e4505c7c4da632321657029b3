6lowpan: fix udp byte ordering

The incoming udp header in lowpan_compress_udp_header function is
already in network byte order.

Everytime we read this values for source and destination port we need
to convert this value to host byte order.

In the outcoming header we need to set this value in network byte order
which the upcoming process assumes.
