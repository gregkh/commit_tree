decnet: use __dev_get_by_index instead of dev_get_by_index to find interface

The following call chain we can identify that dn_cache_getroute() is
protected under rtnl_lock. So if we use __dev_get_by_index() instead
of dev_get_by_index() to find interface handlers in it, this would help
us avoid to change interface reference counter.

rtnetlink_rcv()
  rtnl_lock()
    netlink_rcv_skb()
      dn_cache_getroute()
  rtnl_unlock()
