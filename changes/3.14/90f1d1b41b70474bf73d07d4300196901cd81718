IB/core: Add flow steering support for IPoIB UD traffic

When creating an IPoIB UD QP, provide a hint to the low level driver
that the QP should support flow-steering.  This means that privileged
user space applications can steer TCP/IP IPoIB traffic from the
network stack, in a similar manner done with Ethernet RAW_PACKET QPs.

The hint is provided through new QP creation flag called NETIF_QP.
