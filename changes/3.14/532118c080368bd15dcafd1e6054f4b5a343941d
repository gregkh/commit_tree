staging: lustre: ptlrpc: fix indentation

Fix the following type of checkpatch warning to comply with coding
style:
WARNING: suspect code indent for conditional statements

Also join a debug string split across lines, as it was on the same lines
as the other changes anyway. And reformat some comments in the kernel
coding style for the same reason.
