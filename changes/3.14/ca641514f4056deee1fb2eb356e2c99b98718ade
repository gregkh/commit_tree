mm: thp: optimize compound_trans_huge

Currently we don't clobber page_tail->first_page during split_huge_page,
so compound_trans_head can be set to compound_head without adverse
effects, and this mostly optimizes away a smp_rmb.

It looks worthwhile to keep around the implementation that doesn't relay
on page_tail->first_page not to be clobbered, because it would be
necessary if we'll decide to enforce page->private to zero at all times
whenever PG_private is not set, also for anonymous pages.  For anonymous
pages enforcing such an invariant doesn't matter as anonymous pages
don't use page->private so we can get away with this microoptimization.
