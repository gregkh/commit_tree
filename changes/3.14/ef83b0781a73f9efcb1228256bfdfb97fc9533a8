PCI: Remove from bus_list and release resources in pci_release_dev()

Previously we removed the pci_dev from the bus_list and released its
resources in pci_destroy_dev().  But that's too early: it's possible to
call pci_destroy_dev() twice for the same device (e.g., via sysfs), and
that will cause an oops when we try to remove it from bus_list the second
time.

We should remove it from the bus_list only when the last reference to the
pci_dev has been released, i.e., in pci_release_dev().
