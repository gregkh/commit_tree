MIPS: jz4740: update platform data for JZ4740 usb device controller

The platform data already available in tree for JZ4740 USB Device
Controller was previously used by an out-of-tree USB gadget driver
which was not relying on the musb driver and was written by Ingenic
and the Qi-Hardware community.

Update platform data for JZ4740 USB device controller to be used with
musb driver.
