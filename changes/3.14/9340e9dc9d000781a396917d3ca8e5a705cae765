staging: xillybus: Return -EIO if *_iomap fails, instead of 0

This patch replicates the correction made by Wei Yongjun on a second
occurrence of the same bug.

The first correction was in commit 8eec4555511bfa1f8a2e0a2de45c988fd30c3efb.

Bug fixed: The error code was not set, so the error condition wasn't reflected
in the return value.
