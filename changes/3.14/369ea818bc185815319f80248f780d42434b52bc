dts: Add a binding for Synopsys emac max-frame-size

This change adds a parameter for the Synopsys 10/100/1000
stmmac Ethernet driver to configure the maximum frame
size supported by the EMAC driver. Synopsys allows the FIFO
sizes to be configured when the cores are built for a particular
device, but do not provide a way for the driver to read
information from the device about the maximum MTU size
supported as limited by the device's FIFO size.
