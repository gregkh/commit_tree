hugetlb_cgroup: convert away from cftype->read()

In preparation of conversion to kernfs, cgroup file handling is being
consolidated so that it can be easily mapped to the seq_file based
interface of kernfs.

All users of cftype->read() can be easily served, usually better, by
seq_file and other methods.  Update hugetlb_cgroup_read() to return
u64 instead of printing itself and rename it to
hugetlb_cgroup_read_u64().

This patch doesn't make any visible behavior changes.
