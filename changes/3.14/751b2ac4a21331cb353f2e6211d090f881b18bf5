ARM: sunxi: Register the A31 reset IP in init_time

The A31 has a reset IP that maintains a few other IPs in reset by
default. Among these IPs are the UARTs, and most notably the timers. We
thus need to register the reset driver before initializing the timers so
that the reset timer can use the reset framework.
