ASoC: da9055: Fix device registration of PMIC and CODEC devices

Currently the I2C device Ids conflict for the MFD and CODEC so
cannot be both instantiated on one platform. This patch updates
the Ids and names to make them unique from each other.

It should be noted that the I2C addresses for both PMIC and CODEC
are modifiable so instantiation of the two are kept as separate
devices, rather than instantiating the CODEC from the MFD code.
