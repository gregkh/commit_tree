ion: optimize ion_heap_buffer_zero

ion_heap_buffer_zero can spend a long time in unmap_kernel_range
if it has to broadcast a tlb flush to every cpu for every page.
Modify it to batch pages into a larger region to clear using a
single mapping.  This may cause the mapping size to change if
the buffer size is not a multiple of the mapping size, so
switch to allocating the address space for each chunk.  This
allows us to use vm_map_ram to handle the allocation and mapping
together.

The number of pages to zero using a single mapping is set to 32
to hit the fastpath in vm_map_ram.
