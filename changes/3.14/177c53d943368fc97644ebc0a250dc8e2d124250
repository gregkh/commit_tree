stop_machine: Fix^2 race between stop_two_cpus() and stop_cpus()

We must use smp_call_function_single(.wait=1) for the
irq_cpu_stop_queue_work() to ensure the queueing is actually done under
stop_cpus_lock. Without this we could have dropped the lock by the time
we do the queueing and get the race we tried to fix.
