bridge: Fix the way to insert new local fdb entries in br_fdb_changeaddr

Since commit bc9a25d21ef8 ("bridge: Add vlan support for local fdb entries"),
br_fdb_changeaddr() has inserted a new local fdb entry only if it can
find old one. But if we have two ports where they have the same address
or user has deleted a local entry, there will be no entry for one of the
ports.

Example of problematic case:
  ip link set eth0 address aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
  ip link set eth1 address aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
  brctl addif br0 eth0
  brctl addif br0 eth1 # eth1 will not have a local entry due to dup.
  ip link set eth1 address 12:34:56:78:90:ab
Then, the new entry for the address 12:34:56:78:90:ab will not be
created, and the bridge device will not be able to communicate.

Insert new entries regardless of whether we can find old entries or not.
