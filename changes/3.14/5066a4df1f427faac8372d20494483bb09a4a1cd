dm log userspace: allow mark requests to piggyback on flush requests

In the cluster evironment, cluster write has poor performance because
userspace_flush() has to contact a userspace program (cmirrord) for
clear/mark/flush requests.  But both mark and flush requests require
cmirrord to communicate the message to all the cluster nodes for each
flush call.  This behaviour is really slow.

To address this we now merge mark and flush requests together to reduce
the kernel-userspace-kernel time.  We allow a new directive,
"integrated_flush" that can be used to instruct the kernel log code to
combine flush and mark requests when directed by userspace.  If not
directed by userspace (due to an older version of the userspace code
perhaps), the kernel will function as it did previously - preserving
backwards compatibility.  Additionally, flush requests are performed
lazily when only clear requests exist.
