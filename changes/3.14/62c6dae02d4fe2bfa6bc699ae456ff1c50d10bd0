PNP: Mark the function pnp_build_option() as static in resource.c

This patch marks the function pnp_build_option() as static in resource.c
because it is not used outside this file.

Thus, it also eliminates the following warning in resource.c:
drivers/pnp/resource.c:34:20: warning: no previous prototype for ‘pnp_build_option’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
