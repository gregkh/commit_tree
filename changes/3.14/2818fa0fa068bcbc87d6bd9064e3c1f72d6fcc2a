pkt_sched: fq: do not hold qdisc lock while allocating memory

Resizing fq hash table allocates memory while holding qdisc spinlock,
with BH disabled.

This is definitely not good, as allocation might sleep.

We can drop the lock and get it when needed, we hold RTNL so no other
changes can happen at the same time.
