block: Remove bi_idx hacks

Now that drivers have been converted to the new bvec_iter primitives,
there's no need to trim the bvec before we submit it; and we can't trim
it once we start sharing bvecs.

It used to be that passing a partially completed bio (i.e. one with
nonzero bi_idx) to generic_make_request() was a dangerous thing -
various drivers would choke on such things. But with immutable biovecs
and our new bio splitting that shares the biovecs, submitting partially
completed bios has to work (and should work, now that all the drivers
have been completed to the new primitives)
