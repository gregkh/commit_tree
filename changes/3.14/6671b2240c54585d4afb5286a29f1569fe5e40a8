tun: remove bogus hardware vlan acceleration flags from vlan_features

Even though only the outer vlan tag can be HW accelerated in the transmission
path, in the TUN/TAP driver vlan_features mirrors hw_features, which happens
to have the NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_?TAG_TX flags set. Because of this, during packet
tranmisssion through a stacked vlan device dev_hard_start_xmit, (incorrectly)
assuming that the vlan device supports hardware vlan acceleration, does not
add the vlan header to the skb payload and the inner vlan tags are lost
(vlan_tci contains the outer vlan tag when userspace reads the packet from
the tap device).
