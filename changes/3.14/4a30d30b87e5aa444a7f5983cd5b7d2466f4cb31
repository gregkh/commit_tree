[media] s5p-jpeg: Synchronize V4L2_CID_JPEG_CHROMA_SUBSAMPLING control value

When output queue fourcc is set to any flavour of YUV,
the V4L2_CID_JPEG_CHROMA_SUBSAMPLING control value as
well as its in-driver cached counterpart have to be
updated with the subsampling property of the format
so as to be able to provide correct information to the
user space and preclude setting an illegal subsampling
mode for Exynos4x12 encoder.
