thermal: imx: add necessary clk operation

Thermal sensor needs pll3_usb_otg when measuring temperature,
otherwise the temperature read will be incorrect, so need to
enable this clk before sensor working, for alarm function,
as hardware will take measurement periodically, so we should
keep this clk always on once alarm function is enabled.
