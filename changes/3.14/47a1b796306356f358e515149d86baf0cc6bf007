tick/timekeeping: Call update_wall_time outside the jiffies lock

Since the xtime lock was split into the timekeeping lock and
the jiffies lock, we no longer need to call update_wall_time()
while holding the jiffies lock.

Thus, this patch splits update_wall_time() out from do_timer().

This allows us to get away from calling clock_was_set_delayed()
in update_wall_time() and instead use the standard clock_was_set()
call that previously would deadlock, as it causes the jiffies lock
to be acquired.
