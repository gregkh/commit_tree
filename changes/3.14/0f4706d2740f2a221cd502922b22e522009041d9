drm/i915: Disable stolen memory when DMAR is active

We have reports of heavy screen corruption if we try to use the stolen
memory reserved by the BIOS whilst the DMA-Remapper is active. This
quirk may be only specific to a few machines or BIOSes, but first lets
apply the big hammer and always disable use of stolen memory when DMAR
is active.

v2 by Jani: Rebase on -fixes, only look at intel_iommu_gfx_mapped.
