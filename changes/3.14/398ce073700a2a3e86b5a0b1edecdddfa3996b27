smack: fix: allow either entry be missing on access/access2 check (v2)

This is a regression caused by f7112e6c. When either subject or
object is not found the answer for access should be no. This
patch fixes the situation. '0' is written back instead of failing
with -EINVAL.

v2: cosmetic style fixes
