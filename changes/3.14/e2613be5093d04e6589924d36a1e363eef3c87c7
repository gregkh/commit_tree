n_tty: Fix stale echo output

When echoes cannot be flushed to output (usually because the tty
has no more write room) and L_ECHO is subsequently turned off, then
when L_ECHO is turned back on, stale echoes are output.

Output completed echoes regardless of the L_ECHO setting:
  1. before normal writes to that tty
  2. if the tty was stopped by soft flow control and is being
     restarted
