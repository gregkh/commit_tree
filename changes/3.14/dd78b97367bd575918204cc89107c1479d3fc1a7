x86, boot: Move CPU flags out of cpucheck

Refactor the CPU flags handling out of the cpucheck routines so that
they can be reused by the future ASLR routines (in order to detect CPU
features like RDRAND and RDTSC).

This reworks has_eflag() and has_fpu() to be used on both 32-bit and
64-bit, and refactors the calls to cpuid to make them PIC-safe on 32-bit.
