dmaengine: Add DMA_PRIVATE to BCM2835 driver

Without DMA_PRIVATE the driver is not able to allocate more than one channel.
Since it uses dma_get_any_slave_channel that calls private_candidate,
the second allocation fails at
/* some channels are already publicly allocated */
Maybe it should be fixed in the core, but at least this fixes the bug.
