iio: mxs-lradc: add scale_available file to channels

Adds in_voltageX_scale_available file for every channel to read
the different available scales.
There are two scales per channel:
 [0] = divider_by_two disabled (default)
 [1] = divider_by_two enabled
The scale is a struct made of integer and nano parts to build
a long decimal number.
