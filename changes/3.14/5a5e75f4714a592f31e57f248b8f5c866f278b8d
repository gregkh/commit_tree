tile: remove compat_sys_lookup_dcookie declaration to fix compile error

With commit d8d14bd09cdd ("fs/compat: fix lookup_dcookie() parameter
handling") I changed the type of the len parameter of the
lookup_dcookie() syscall.

However I missed that there was still a stale declaration in
arch/tile/..  which now causes a compile error on tile:

  In file included from fs/dcookies.c:28:0:
  include/linux/compat.h:425:17: error: conflicting types for 'compat_sys_lookup_dcookie'
  fs/dcookies.c:207:1: error: conflicting types for 'compat_sys_lookup_dcookie'

Simply remove the declaration in the tile architecture, which is only a
leftover from before the different compat lookup_dcookie() versions have
been merged.  The correct declaration is now in include/linux/compat.h

The build error was reported by Fenguang's build bot.
