net: eth: cpsw: Correctly attach to GPIO bitbang MDIO driver

When the GPIO bitbang MDIO driver is used instead of the Davinci MDIO driver
we need to configure the phy_id string differently. Otherwise this string
looks like this "gpio.6" instead of "gpio-0" and the PHY is not found when
phy_connect() is called.
