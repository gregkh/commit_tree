mtd: nand: omap: fix ecclayout->oobfree->offset

1) In current implementation, ecclayout->oobfree->offset is calculated with
 respect to ecclayout->eccpos[0] which is incorrect because ECC bytes may not
 be stored contiguously in OOB.
 So, this patch calculates ecclayout->oobfree->offset with respect to last
 ECC byte-position 'eccpos[ecclayout->eccbytes-1]'.

2) ECC layout of some ecc-schemes expects reserved-markers at specific eccpos[]
 which should not be over-written by any file-system metadata.
 So this patch aligns oobfree->offset taking into account of such markers.
