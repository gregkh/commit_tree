futex: revert back to the explicit waiter counting code

Srikar Dronamraju reports that commit b0c29f79ecea ("futexes: Avoid
taking the hb->lock if there's nothing to wake up") causes java threads
getting stuck on futexes when runing specjbb on a power7 numa box.

The cause appears to be that the powerpc spinlocks aren't using the same
ticket lock model that we use on x86 (and other) architectures, which in
turn result in the "spin_is_locked()" test in hb_waiters_pending()
occasionally reporting an unlocked spinlock even when there are pending
waiters.

So this reinstates Davidlohr Bueso's original explicit waiter counting
code, which I had convinced Davidlohr to drop in favor of figuring out
the pending waiters by just using the existing state of the spinlock and
the wait queue.
