Revert "xhci: Set scatter-gather limit to avoid failed block writes."

This reverts commit f2d9b991c549f159dc9ae81f77d8206c790cbfee.

We are ripping out commit 35773dac5f862cb1c82ea151eba3e2f6de51ec3e "usb:
xhci: Link TRB must not occur within a USB payload burst" because it's a
hack that caused regressions in the usb-storage and userspace USB
drivers that use usbfs and libusb.  This commit attempted to fix the
issues with that patch.
