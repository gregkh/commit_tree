block: add cond_resched() to potentially long running ioctl discard loop

When mkfs issues a full device discard and the device only
supports discards of a smallish size, we can loop in
blkdev_issue_discard() for a long time. If preempt isn't enabled,
this can turn into a softlock situation and the kernel will
start complaining.

Add an explicit cond_resched() at the end of the loop to avoid
that.
