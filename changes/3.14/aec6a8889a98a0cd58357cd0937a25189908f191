mm, show_mem: remove SHOW_MEM_FILTER_PAGE_COUNT

Commit 4b59e6c47309 ("mm, show_mem: suppress page counts in
non-blockable contexts") introduced SHOW_MEM_FILTER_PAGE_COUNT to
suppress PFN walks on large memory machines.  Commit c78e93630d15 ("mm:
do not walk all of system memory during show_mem") avoided a PFN walk in
the generic show_mem helper which removes the requirement for
SHOW_MEM_FILTER_PAGE_COUNT in that case.

This patch removes PFN walkers from the arch-specific implementations
that report on a per-node or per-zone granularity.  ARM and unicore32
still do a PFN walk as they report memory usage on each bank which is a
much finer granularity where the debugging information may still be of
use.  As the remaining arches doing PFN walks have relatively small
amounts of memory, this patch simply removes SHOW_MEM_FILTER_PAGE_COUNT.
