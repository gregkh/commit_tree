bcache/md: Use raid stripe size

Now that we've got code for raid5/6 stripe awareness, bcache just needs
to know about the stripes and when writing partial stripes is expensive
- we probably don't want to enable this optimization for raid1 or 10,
even though they have stripes. So add a flag to queue_limits.
