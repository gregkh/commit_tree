ACPI / hotplug: Rework generic code to handle suprise removals

The generic ACPI hotplug code used for several types of device
doesn't handle surprise removals, mostly because those devices
currently cannot be removed by surprise in the majority of systems.
However, surprise removals should be handled by that code as well
as surprise additions of devices, so make it do that.
