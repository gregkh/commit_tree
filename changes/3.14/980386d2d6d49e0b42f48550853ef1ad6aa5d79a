ARM: OMAP2+: gpmc: fix: DT ONENAND child nodes not probed when MTD_ONENAND is built as module

Fixes: commit 75d3625e0e86b2d8d77b4e9c6f685fd7ea0d5a96
       ARM: OMAP2+: gpmc: add DT bindings for OneNAND

OMAP SoC(s) depend on GPMC controller driver to parse GPMC DT child nodes and
register them platform_device for ONENAND driver to probe later. However this does
not happen if generic MTD_ONENAND framework is built as module (CONFIG_MTD_ONENAND=m).

Therefore, when MTD/ONENAND and MTD/ONENAND/OMAP2 modules are loaded, they are unable
to find any matching platform_device and remain un-binded. This causes on board
ONENAND flash to remain un-detected.

This patch causes GPMC controller to parse DT nodes when
CONFIG_MTD_ONENAND=y || CONFIG_MTD_ONENAND=m
