spi: sc18is602: Convert to use bits_per_word_mask

Since commit 543bb25 "spi: add ability to validate xfer->bits_per_word in SPI
core", the driver can set bits_per_word_mask for the master then the SPI core
will reject transfers that attempt to use an unsupported bits_per_word value.
So we can remove the bits_per_word checking in sc18is602_check_transfer() and
let SPI core handle the checking.
