posix-timers: Use sighand lock instead of tasklist_lock for task clock sample

There is no need for the tasklist_lock just to take a process
wide clock sample.

All we need is to get a coherent sample that doesn't race with
exit() and exec():

* exit() may be concurrently reaping a task and flushing its time

* sighand is unstable under exit() and exec(), and the latter also
  result in group leader that can change

To protect against these, locking the target's sighand is enough.
