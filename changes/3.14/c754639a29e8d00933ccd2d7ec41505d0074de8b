ALSA: oxygen: Xonar DG(X): use headphone volume control

I tried both variants: volume control and impedance selector.
In the first case one minus is that we can't change the
volume of multichannel output without additional software
volume control. However, I am using this variant for the
last three months and this seems good. All multichannel
speaker systems have internal amplifier with the
volume control included, but not all headphones have
this regulator. In the second case, my software volume
control does not save the value after reboot.
