pinctrl: single: fix infinite loop caused by bad mask

commit 4e7e8017a80e1 (pinctrl: pinctrl-single:
enhance to configure multiple pins of different modules) improved
support for pinctrl-single,bits option, but also caused a regression
in parsing badly configured mask data.

If the masks in DT data are not quite right,
pcs_parse_bits_in_pinctrl_entry() can end up in an infinite loop,
trashing memory at the same time.

Add a check to verify that each loop actually removes bits from the
'mask', so that the loop can eventually end.
