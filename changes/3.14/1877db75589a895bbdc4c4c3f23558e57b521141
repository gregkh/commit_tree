md/raid1: restore ability for check and repair to fix read errors.

commit 30bc9b53878a9921b02e3b5bc4283ac1c6de102a
    md/raid1: fix bio handling problems in process_checks()

Move the bio_reset() to a point before where BIO_UPTODATE is checked,
so that check now always report that the bio is uptodate, even if it is not.

This causes process_check() to sometimes treat read-errors as
successful matches so the good data isn't written out.

This patch preserves the flag until it is needed.

Bug was introduced in 3.11, but backported to 3.10-stable (as it fixed
an even worse bug).  So suitable for any -stable since 3.10.
