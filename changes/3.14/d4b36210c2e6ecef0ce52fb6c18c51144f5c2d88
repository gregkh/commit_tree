net: pkt_sched: PIE AQM scheme

Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (PIE) is a scheduler to address the
bufferbloat problem.

>From the IETF draft below:
" Bufferbloat is a phenomenon where excess buffers in the network cause high
latency and jitter. As more and more interactive applications (e.g. voice over
IP, real time video streaming and financial transactions) run in the Internet,
high latency and jitter degrade application performance. There is a pressing
need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and
jitter; and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.

We present here a lightweight design, PIE(Proportional Integral controller
Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queueing latency to a target
value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis and Linux testbed results have
shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under
various congestion situations. The design does not require per-packet
timestamp, so it incurs very small overhead and is simple enough to implement
in both hardware and software.  "
