cgroup: replace cftype->read_seq_string() with cftype->seq_show()

In preparation of conversion to kernfs, cgroup file handling is
updated so that it can be easily mapped to kernfs.  This patch
replaces cftype->read_seq_string() with cftype->seq_show() which is
not limited to single_open() operation and will map directcly to
kernfs seq_file interface.

The conversions are mechanical.  As ->seq_show() doesn't have @css and
@cft, the functions which make use of them are converted to use
seq_css() and seq_cft() respectively.  In several occassions, e.f. if
it has seq_string in its name, the function name is updated to fit the
new method better.

This patch does not introduce any behavior changes.
