ixgbe: reinit_locked() should be called with rtnl_lock

ixgbe_service_task() is calling ixgbe_reinit_locked() without
the rtnl_lock being held. This is because it is being called
from a worker thread and not a rtnl netlink or dcbnl path.

Add rtnl_{un}lock() semantics. I found this during code review.
