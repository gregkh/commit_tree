mm/vmalloc: interchage the implementation of vmalloc_to_{pfn,page}

Currently we are implementing vmalloc_to_pfn() as a wrapper around
vmalloc_to_page(), which is implemented as follow:

 1. walks the page talbes to generates the corresponding pfn,
 2. then converts the pfn to struct page,
 3. returns it.

And vmalloc_to_pfn() re-wraps vmalloc_to_page() to get the pfn.

This seems too circuitous, so this patch reverses the way: implement
vmalloc_to_page() as a wrapper around vmalloc_to_pfn().  This makes
vmalloc_to_pfn() and vmalloc_to_page() slightly more efficient.

No functional change.
