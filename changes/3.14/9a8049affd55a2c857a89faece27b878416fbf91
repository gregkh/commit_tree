kernfs: update sysfs_init_inode_attrs()

sysfs_init_inode_attrs() is a bit clumsy to use requiring the caller
to check whether @sd->s_iattr is already set or not.  Rename it to
sysfs_inode_attrs(), update it to check whether @sd->s_iattr is
already initialized before trying to initialize it and return
@sd->s_iattr.  This simplifies the callers.

While at it,

* Rename struct sysfs_inode_attrs pointer variables to "attrs".  As
  kernfs no longer deals with "struct attribute", this isn't confusing
  and makes it easier to distinguish from struct iattr pointers.

* A new field will be added to sysfs_inode_attrs.  Reindent in
  preparation.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.
