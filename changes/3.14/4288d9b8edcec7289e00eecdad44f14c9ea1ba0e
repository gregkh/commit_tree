extcon: gpio: Request gpio pin before modifying its state

Commit 338de0ca (extcon: gpio: Use gpio driver/chip debounce if supported)
introduced a call to gpio_set_debounce() before actually requesting the
respective gpio pin from the gpio subsystem.

The gpio subsystem expects that a gpio pin was requested before modifying its
state. Not doing so results in a warning from gpiolib, and the gpio pin is
auto-requested. This in turn causes the subsequent devm_gpio_request_one()
to fail. So devm_gpio_request_one() must be called prior to calling
gpio_set_debounce().
