sched: Add new scheduler syscalls to support an extended scheduling parameters ABI

Add the syscalls needed for supporting scheduling algorithms
with extended scheduling parameters (e.g., SCHED_DEADLINE).

In general, it makes possible to specify a periodic/sporadic task,
that executes for a given amount of runtime at each instance, and is
scheduled according to the urgency of their own timing constraints,
i.e.:

 - a (maximum/typical) instance execution time,
 - a minimum interval between consecutive instances,
 - a time constraint by which each instance must be completed.

Thus, both the data structure that holds the scheduling parameters of
the tasks and the system calls dealing with it must be extended.
Unfortunately, modifying the existing struct sched_param would break
the ABI and result in potentially serious compatibility issues with
legacy binaries.

For these reasons, this patch:

 - defines the new struct sched_attr, containing all the fields
   that are necessary for specifying a task in the computational
   model described above;

 - defines and implements the new scheduling related syscalls that
   manipulate it, i.e., sched_setattr() and sched_getattr().

Syscalls are introduced for x86 (32 and 64 bits) and ARM only, as a
proof of concept and for developing and testing purposes. Making them
available on other architectures is straightforward.

Since no "user" for these new parameters is introduced in this patch,
the implementation of the new system calls is just identical to their
already existing counterpart. Future patches that implement scheduling
policies able to exploit the new data structure must also take care of
modifying the sched_*attr() calls accordingly with their own purposes.
