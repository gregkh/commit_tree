blk-mq: rework flush sequencing logic

Witch to using a preallocated flush_rq for blk-mq similar to what's done
with the old request path.  This allows us to set up the request properly
with a tag from the actually allowed range and ->rq_disk as needed by
some drivers.  To make life easier we also switch to dynamic allocation
of ->flush_rq for the old path.

This effectively reverts most of

    "blk-mq: fix for flush deadlock"

and

    "blk-mq: Don't reserve a tag for flush request"
