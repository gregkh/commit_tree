ixgbe: add braces around else condition in ixgbe_qv_lock_* calls

This patch adds braces around the ixgbe_qv_lock_* calls which previously only
had braces around the if portion. Kernel style guidelines for this require
parenthesis around all conditions if they are required around one. In addition
the comment while not illegal C syntax makes the code look wrong at a cursory
glance. This patch corrects the style and adds braces so that the full if-else
block is uniform.
