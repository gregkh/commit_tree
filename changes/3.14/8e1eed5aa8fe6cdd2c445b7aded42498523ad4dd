drm/i915: Try harder to get best m, n, p values with minimal error

Basically check for both +ive and -ive deviation from target clock and
pick the one with minimal error. If we get a direct match, break from
loop to acheive some optimization.

v2: Use signed variable for target and calculated dsi clock values
