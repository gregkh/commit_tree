mlx4_en: Add PTP hardware clock

This adds a PHC to the mlx4_en driver. We use reader/writer spinlocks to
protect the timecounter since every packet received needs to call
timecounter_cycle2time() when timestamping is enabled.  This can become
a performance bottleneck with RSS and multiple receive queues if normal
spinlocks are used.

This driver has been tested with both Documentation/ptp/testptp and the
linuxptp project (http://linuxptp.sourceforge.net/) on a Mellanox
ConnectX-3 card.
