tracing/probes: Fix basic print type functions

The print format of s32 type was "ld" and it's casted to "long".  So
it turned out to print 4294967295 for "-1" on 64-bit systems.  Not
sure whether it worked well on 32-bit systems.

Anyway, it doesn't need to have cast argument at all since it already
casted using type pointer - just get rid of it.  Thanks to Oleg for
pointing that out.

And print 0x prefix for unsigned type as it shows hex numbers.
