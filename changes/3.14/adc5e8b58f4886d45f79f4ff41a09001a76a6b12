kernfs: drop s_ prefix from kernfs_node members

kernfs has just been separated out from sysfs and we're already in
full conflict mode.  Nothing can make the situation any worse.  Let's
take the chance to name things properly.

s_ prefix for kernfs members is used inconsistently and a misnomer
now.  It's not like kernfs_node is used widely across the kernel
making the ability to grep for the members particularly useful.  Let's
just drop the prefix.

This patch is strictly rename only and doesn't introduce any
functional difference.
