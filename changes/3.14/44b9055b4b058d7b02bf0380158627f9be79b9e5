[media] m88ds3103: use I2C mux for tuner I2C adapter

Switch standard I2C adapter to muxed I2C adapter.

David reported that I2C adapter implementation caused deadlock.
I discussed with Jean and he suggested to implement it as a
multiplexed i2c adapter because tuner I2C bus could be seen like
own I2C segment.
