libceph: start using oloc abstraction

Instead of relying on pool fields in ceph_file_layout (for mapping) and
ceph_pg (for enconding), start using ceph_object_locator (oloc)
abstraction.  Note that userspace oloc currently consists of pool, key,
nspace and hash fields, while this one contains only a pool.  This is
OK, because at this point we only send (i.e. encode) olocs and never
have to receive (i.e. decode) them.

This makes keeping a copy of ceph_file_layout in every osd request
unnecessary, so ceph_osd_request::r_file_layout field is nuked.
