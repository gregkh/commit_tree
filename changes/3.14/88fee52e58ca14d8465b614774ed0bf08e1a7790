perf list: Fix checking for supported events on older kernels

"perf list" listing of hardware events doesn't work on older ARM devices.
The change enabling event detection:

     perf list: Skip unsupported events

uses the following code in tools/perf/util/parse-events.c:

        struct perf_event_attr attr = {
                .type = type,
                .config = config,
                .disabled = 1,
                .exclude_kernel = 1,
        };

On ARM machines pre-dating the Cortex-A15 this doesn't work, as these
machines don't support .exclude_kernel.  So starting with 3.12 "perf
list" does not report any hardware events at all on older machines (seen
on Rasp-Pi, Pandaboard, Beagleboard, etc).

This version of the patch makes changes suggested by Namhyung Kim to
check for EACCESS and retry (instead of just dropping the
exclude_kernel) so we can properly handle machines where
/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid is set to 2.
