[media] v4l: ti-vpe: Fix the data_type value for UYVY VPDMA format

The data_type value to be programmed in the data descriptors to fetch/write a
UYVY buffer was not mentioned correctly in the older DRA7x documentation. This
caused VPE to fail with UYVY color formats.
Update the data_type value to fix functionality when UYVY format is used.
