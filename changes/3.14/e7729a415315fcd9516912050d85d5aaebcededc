ALSA: hda - Fix silent output on MacBook Air 1,1

Similarly to other Apple products, MBA 1,1 needs a specific quirk.
Pin 0x18 must be set to VREF_50 to have sound output.  This was no
longer done since commit 1a97b7f, resulting in a mute built-in speaker.

This patch corrects the regression by creating a fixup for the MBA 1,1.
