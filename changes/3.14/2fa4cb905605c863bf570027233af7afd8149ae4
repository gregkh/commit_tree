ath9k_htc: make ->sta_rc_update atomic for most calls

sta_rc_update() callback must be atomic, hence we can not take mutexes
or do other operations, which can sleep in ath9k_htc_sta_rc_update().

I think we can just return from ath9k_htc_sta_rc_update(), if it is
called without IEEE80211_RC_SUPP_RATES_CHANGED bit. That will help
with scheduling while atomic bug for most cases (except mesh and IBSS
modes).

For mesh and IBSS I do not see other solution like creating additional
workqueue, because sending firmware command require us to sleep, but
this can be done in additional patch.

Patch partially fixes bug:
