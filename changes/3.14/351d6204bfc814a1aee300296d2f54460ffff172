tty: an overflow of multiplication in drivers/tty/cyclades.c

there is an overflow in the code :
cyz_polling_cycle = (arg * HZ) / 1000,
the multiplicator arg comes from user, so it may be an overflow if
arg is a big number. And the value of cyc_polling_cycle will be
wrong when it is used next time.
