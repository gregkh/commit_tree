fix O_SYNC|O_APPEND syncing the wrong range on write()

It actually goes back to 2004 ([PATCH] Concurrent O_SYNC write support)
when sync_page_range() had been introduced; generic_file_write{,v}() correctly
synced
	pos_after_write - written .. pos_after_write - 1
but generic_file_aio_write() synced
	pos_before_write .. pos_before_write + written - 1
instead.  Which is not the same thing with O_APPEND, obviously.
A couple of years later correct variant had been killed off when
everything switched to use of generic_file_aio_write().

All users of generic_file_aio_write() are affected, and the same bug
has been copied into other instances of ->aio_write().

The fix is trivial; the only subtle point is that generic_write_sync()
ought to be inlined to avoid calculations useless for the majority of
calls.
