sh: prefix sh-specific "CCR" and "CCR2" by "SH_"

Commit bcf24e1daa94 ("mmc: omap_hsmmc: use the generic config for
omap2plus devices"), enabled the build for other platforms for compile
testing.

sh-allmodconfig now fails with:

    include/linux/omap-dma.h:171:8: error: expected identifier before numeric constant
    make[4]: *** [drivers/mmc/host/omap_hsmmc.o] Error 1

This happens because SuperH #defines "CCR", which is one of the enum
values in include/linux/omap-dma.h.  There's a similar issue with "CCR2"
on sh2a.

As "CCR" and "CCR2" are too generic names for global #defines, prefix
them with "SH_" to fix this.
