Btrfs: cleanup unnecessary parameter and variant of prepare_pages()

- the caller has gotten the inode object, needn't pass the file object.
  And if so, we needn't define a inode pointer variant.
- the position should be aligned by the page size not sector size, so
  we also needn't pass the root object into prepare_pages().
