f2fs: add flags and helpers to support inline data

Add new inode flags F2FS_INLINE_DATA and FI_INLINE_DATA to indicate
whether the inode has inline data.

Inline data makes use of inode block's data indices region to save small
file. Currently there are 923 data indices in an inode block. Since
inline xattr has made use of the last 50 indices to save its data, there
are 873 indices left which can be used for inline data. When
FI_INLINE_DATA is set, the layout of inode block's indices region is
like below:

+-----------------+
|                 | Reserved. reserve_new_block() will make use of
| i_addr[0]       | i_addr[0] when we need to reserve a new data block
|                 | to convert inline data into regular one's.
|-----------------|
|                 | Used by inline data. A file whose size is less than
| i_addr[1~872]   | 3488 bytes(~3.4k) and doesn't reserve extra
|                 | blocks by fallocate() can be saved here.
|-----------------|
|                 |
| i_addr[873~922] | Reserved for inline xattr
|                 |
