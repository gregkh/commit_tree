net: Check skb->rxhash in gro_receive

When initializing a gro_list for a packet, first check the rxhash of
the incoming skb against that of the skb's in the list. This should be
a very strong inidicator of whether the flow is going to be matched,
and potentially allows a lot of other checks to be short circuited.
Use skb_hash_raw so that we don't force the hash to be calculated.

Tested by running netperf 200 TCP_STREAMs between two machines with
GRO, HW rxhash, and 1G. Saw no performance degration, slight reduction
of time in dev_gro_receive.
