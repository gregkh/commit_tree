[media] em28xx: add debouncing mechanism for GPI-connected buttons

So far, the driver only supports a snapshot button which is assigned to
register 0x0c bit 5. This special port has a built-in debouncing mechanism.
For buttons connected to ordinary GPI ports, this patch implements a software
debouncing mechanism.
