scripts/gen_initramfs_list.sh: fix flags for initramfs LZ4 compression

LZ4 as implemented in the kernel differs from the default method now
used by the reference implementation of LZ4.  Until the in-kernel method
is updated to support the new default, passing the legacy flag (-l) to
the compressor is necessary.  Without this flag the kernel-generated,
LZ4-compressed initramfs is junk.

: It seems that lz4 supports legacy format with the same option as lz4c

: see whether it is new format or not.

: It shows new format magic number without this patch.  New format magic

: Currently kernel supports legacy format only.
