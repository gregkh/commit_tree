ARM: 7952/1: mm: Fix the memblock allocation for LPAE machines

Commit ad6492b8 added much needed memblock_virt_alloc_low() and further
commit 07bacb3 {memblock, bootmem: restore goal for alloc_low} fixed
the issue with low memory limit thanks to Yinghai. But even after all
these fixes, there is still one case where the limit check done with
ARCH_LOW_ADDRESS_LIMIT for low memory fails. Russell pointed out the
issue with 32 bit LPAE machines in below thread.

Since on some LPAE machines where memory start address is beyond 4GB,
the low memory marker in memblock will be set to default
ARCH_LOW_ADDRESS_LIMIT which is wrong. We can fix this by letting
architectures set the ARCH_LOW_ADDRESS_LIMIT using another export
similar to memblock_set_current_limit() but am not sure whether
its worth the trouble. Tell me if you think otherwise.

Rather am just trying to fix that one broken case using
memblock_virt_alloc() in setup code since the memblock.current_limit
is updated appropriately makes it work on all ARM 32 bit machines.
