clk: samsung: exynos5250: Sort definitions by registers and bitfield

This patch reorders clock definitions, so they are sorted by register
addresses and bitfield shifts. When at it, blank lines are added to
separate definitions of clocks from different registers.

Overall this should make the driver more readable and reduce the number
of potential conflicts when adding new entries.
