drivers: ide: Include appropriate header file in ide-cd_verbose.c

Include appropriate header file ide-cd.h in ide-cd_verbose.c because
function ide_cd_log_error() has its prototype declaration in ide-cd.h.
Also, include linux/ide.h because it contains certain declarations
necessary for including ide-cd.h.

This eliminates the following warnings in ide-cd_verbose.c:
drivers/ide/ide-cd_verbose.c:251:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘ide_cd_log_error’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
