perf/x86/uncore: Fix IVT/SNB-EP uncore CBOX NID filter table

This patch updates the CBOX PMU filters mapping tables for SNB-EP
and IVT (model 45 and 62 respectively).

The NID umask always comes in addition to another umask.
When set, the NID filter is applied.

The current mapping tables were missing some code/umask
combinations to account for the NID umask. This patch
fixes that.
