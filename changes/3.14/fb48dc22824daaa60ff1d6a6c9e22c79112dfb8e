powerpc: Increase EEH recovery timeout for SR-IOV

In order to support concurrent adapter firmware download
to SR-IOV adapters on pSeries, each VF will see an EEH event
where the slot will remain in the unavailable state for
the duration of the adapter firmware update, which can take
as long as 5 minutes. Extend the EEH recovery timeout to
account for this.
