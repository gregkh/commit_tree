spi: rspi: Fix NULL pointer dereference on SH7757

SH7757 doesn't pass platform data, in which case spi-rspi uses default
parameters.

However, commit 5ce0ba88650f2606244a761d92e2b725f4ab3583 ("spi: rcar: add
Renesas QSPI support on RSPI") added a new user of the platform data, but
forgot to check for its validity first, causing a NULL pointer dereference
on SH7757.

Add the missing check to fix this.
