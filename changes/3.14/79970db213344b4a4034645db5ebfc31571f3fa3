i2c: mv64xxx: refactor message start to ensure proper initialization

Because the offload mechanism can fall back to a standard transfer,
having two seperate initialization states is unfortunate. Let's just
have one state which does things consistently. This fixes a bug where
some preparation was missing when the fallback happened. And it makes
the code much easier to follow. To implement this, we put the check
if offload is possible at the top of the offload setup function.
