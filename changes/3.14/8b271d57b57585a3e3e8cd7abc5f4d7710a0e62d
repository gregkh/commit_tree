arm/xen: Initialize event channels earlier

Event channels driver needs to be initialized very early. Until now, Xen
initialization was done after all CPUs was bring up.

We can safely move the initialization to an early initcall.

Also use a cpu notifier to:
    - Register the VCPU when the CPU is prepared
    - Enable event channel IRQ when the CPU is running
