kernfs: update kernfs_rename_ns() to consider KERNFS_STATIC_NAME

kernfs_rename_ns() currently assumes that the target sysfs_dirent has
a copied name.  This has been okay because sysfs supports rename only
for directories which always have copied names; however, there's
nothing in kernfs interface which calls for such restriction and
currently invoking kernfs_rename_ns() on a regular file leads to oops
because it ends up trying to kfree() a static name.

This patch updates kernfs_rename_ns() so that it skips kfree() of the
old name if it's static.  This allows it to be used for all node
types.
