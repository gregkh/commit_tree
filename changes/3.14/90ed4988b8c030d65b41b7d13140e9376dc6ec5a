e752x_edac: Fix pci_dev usage count

In case the device 0, function 1 is not found using pci_get_device(),
pci_scan_single_device() will be used but, differently than
pci_get_device(), it allocates a pci_dev but doesn't does bump the usage
count on the pci_dev and after few module removals and loads the pci_dev
will be freed.
