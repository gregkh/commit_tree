arm64: KVM: Add Kconfig option for max VCPUs per-Guest

Current max VCPUs per-Guest is set to 4 which is preventing
us from creating a Guest (or VM) with 8 VCPUs on Host (e.g.
X-Gene Storm SOC) with 8 Host CPUs.

The correct value of max VCPUs per-Guest should be same as
the max CPUs supported by GICv2 which is 8 but, increasing
value of max VCPUs per-Guest can make things slower hence
we add Kconfig option to let KVM users select appropriate
max VCPUs per-Guest.
