ipv6: move ip6_sk_accept_pmtu from generic pmtu update path to ipv6 one

In commit 93b36cf3425b9b ("ipv6: support IPV6_PMTU_INTERFACE on sockets")
I made a horrible mistake to add ip6_sk_accept_pmtu to the generic
sctp_icmp_frag_needed path. This results in build warnings if IPv6 is
disabled which were luckily caught by Fengguang's kbuild bot. But it
also leads to a kernel panic IPv4 frag-needed packet is received.
