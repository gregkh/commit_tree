ipv6: protect protocols not handling ipv4 from v4 connection/bind attempts

Some ipv6 protocols cannot handle ipv4 addresses, so we must not allow
connecting and binding to them. sendmsg logic does already check msg->name
for this but must trust already connected sockets which could be set up
for connection to ipv4 address family.

Per-socket flag ipv6only is of no use here, as it is under users control
by setsockopt.
