mtd: gpmi: add sanity check when mapping DMA for read_buf/write_buf

The buffer pointer passed from the upper layer may points to
a buffer in the stack or a buffer allocated by vmalloc, and etc..

This patch adds more sanity check to this buffer.
After this patch, if we meet a buffer which is allocated by vmalloc or
a buffer in the stack, we will use our own DMA buffer @data_buffer_dma
to do the DMA operations. If the buffer is not the cases above, we will
map it for DMA operations directly.
