sunrpc: create a new dummy pipe for gssd to hold open

rpc.gssd will naturally hold open any pipe named */clnt*/gssd that shows
up under rpc_pipefs. That behavior gives us a reliable mechanism to tell
whether it's actually running or not.

Create a new toplevel "gssd" directory in rpc_pipefs when it's mounted.
Under that directory create another directory called "clntXX", and then
within that a pipe called "gssd".

We'll never send an upcall along that pipe, and any downcall written to
it will just return -EINVAL.
