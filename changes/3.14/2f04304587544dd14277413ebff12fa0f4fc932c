arm64: kernel: refactor code to install/uninstall breakpoints

Most of the code executed to install and uninstall breakpoints is
common and can be factored out in a function that through a runtime
operations type provides the requested implementation.

This patch creates a common function that can be used to install/uninstall
breakpoints and defines the set of operations that can be carried out
through it.
