mac80211: don't delay station destruction

If we can assume that stations are never referenced by the
driver after sta_state returns (and this is true since the
previous iwlmvm patch and for all other drivers) then we
don't need to delay station destruction, and don't need to
play tricks with rcu_barrier() etc.

This should speed up some scenarios like hostapd shutdown.
