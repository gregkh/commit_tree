openvswitch: Pad OVS_PACKET_ATTR_PACKET if linear copy was performed

While the zerocopy method is correctly omitted if user space
does not support unaligned Netlink messages. The attribute is
still not padded correctly as skb_zerocopy() will not ensure
padding and the attribute size is no longer pre calculated
though nla_reserve() which ensured padding previously.

This patch applies appropriate padding if a linear data copy
was performed in skb_zerocopy().
