net: mvneta: increase the 64-bit rx/tx stats out of the hot path

Better count packets and bytes in the stack and on 32 bit then
accumulate them at the end for once. This saves two memory writes
and two memory barriers per packet. The incoming packet rate was
increased by 4.7% on the Openblocks AX3 thanks to this.
