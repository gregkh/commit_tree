agp/intel: Use CPU physical address, not bus address, for ioremap()

In i810_setup(), i830_setup(), and i9xx_setup(), we use the result of
pci_bus_address() as an argument to ioremap() and to compute gtt_phys_addr.
These should use pci_resource_start() instead because we want the CPU
physical address, not the bus address.

If there were an AGP device behind a host bridge that translated addresses,
e.g., a PNP0A08 device with _TRA != 0, this would fix a bug.  I'm not aware
of any of those, but they are possible.
