KVM: VMX: Fix DR6 update on #DB exception

According to the SDM, only bits 0-3 of DR6 "may" be cleared by "certain"
debug exception. So do update them on #DB exception in KVM, but leave
the rest alone, only setting BD and BS in addition to already set bits
in DR6. This also aligns us with kvm_vcpu_check_singlestep.
