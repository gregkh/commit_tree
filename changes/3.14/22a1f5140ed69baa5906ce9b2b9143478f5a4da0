sctp: fix a missed .data initialization

As commit 3c68198e75111a90("sctp: Make hmac algorithm selection for
 cookie generation dynamic"), we miss the .data initialization.
If we don't use the net_namespace, the problem that parts of the
sysctl configuration won't be isolation and won't occur.

In sctp_sysctl_net_register(), we register the sysctl for each
net, in the for(), we use the 'table[i].data' as check condition, so
when the 'i' is the index of sctp_hmac_alg, the data is NULL, then
break. So add the .data initialization.
