usb: core: get config and string descriptors for unauthorized devices

There is no need to skip querying the config and string descriptors for
unauthorized WUSB devices when usb_new_device is called.  It is allowed
by WUSB spec.  The only action that needs to be delayed until
authorization time is the set config.  This change allows user mode
tools to see the config and string descriptors earlier in enumeration
which is needed for some WUSB devices to function properly on Android
systems.  It also reduces the amount of divergent code paths needed
for WUSB devices.
