atl1e: update statistics code

As Ben Hutchings pointed out for the stats in alx, some
hardware-specific stats aren't matched to the right net_device_stats
field. Also fix the collision field and include errors in the total
number of RX/TX packets.

Minor whitespace fixes to match the style in alx.
