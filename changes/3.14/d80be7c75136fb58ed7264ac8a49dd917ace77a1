mm, mempolicy: remove unneeded functions for UMA configs

Mempolicies only exist for CONFIG_NUMA configurations.  Therefore, a
certain class of functions are unneeded in configurations where
CONFIG_NUMA is disabled such as functions that duplicate existing
mempolicies, lookup existing policies, set certain mempolicy traits, or
test mempolicies for certain attributes.

Remove the unneeded functions so that any future callers get a compile-
time error and protect their code with CONFIG_NUMA as required.
