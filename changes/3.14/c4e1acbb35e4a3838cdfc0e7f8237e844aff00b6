ACPI / init: Invoke early ACPI initialization later

Commit 73f7d1ca3263 (ACPI / init: Run acpi_early_init() before
timekeeping_init()) optimistically moved the early ACPI initialization
before timekeeping_init(), but that didn't work, because it broke fast
TSC calibration for Julian Wollrath on Thinkpad x121e (and most likely
for others too).  The reason is that acpi_early_init() enables the SCI
and that interferes with the fast TSC calibration mechanism.

Thus follow the original idea to execute acpi_early_init() before
efi_enter_virtual_mode() to help the EFI people for now and we can
revisit the other problem that commit 73f7d1ca3263 attempted to
address in the future (if really necessary).
