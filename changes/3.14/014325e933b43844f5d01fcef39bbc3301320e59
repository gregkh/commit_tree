ARM: tegra: add LED options back into tegra_defconfig

The last time tegra_defconfig was rebuilt, various LEDs options were
somehow selected by other options, and hence their entries in
tegra_defconfig were removed by "make savedefconfig". However, for some
reason this is no longer happening, so we need to add the entries back
into tegra_defconfig so the they are enabled in .config.
