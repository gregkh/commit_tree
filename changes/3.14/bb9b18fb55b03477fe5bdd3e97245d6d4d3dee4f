genl: Add genlmsg_new_unicast() for unicast message allocation

Allocates a new sk_buff large enough to cover the specified payload
plus required Netlink headers. Will check receiving socket for
memory mapped i/o capability and use it if enabled. Will fall back
to non-mapped skb if message size exceeds the frame size of the ring.
