xhci: replace xhci_read_64() with readq()

Function xhci_read_64() is used to read 64bit xHC registers residing in MMIO.
On 32bit systems, xHC registers need to be read with 32bit accesses by
reading first the lower 32bits and then the higher 32bits.

Replace all calls to xhci_read_64() with calls to readq() and include
asm-generic/io-64-nonatomic-lo-hi.h header file, so that if the system
is not 64bit, readq() will read registers in 32bit chunks with low-high order.

This is done to reduce code duplication since 64bit low-high read logic
is already implemented and to take advantage of inherent "atomic" 64bit
read operations on 64bit systems.
