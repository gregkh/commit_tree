ARM: 7980/1: kernel: improve error message when LPAE config doesn't match CPU

Currently, when the kernel is configured with LPAE support, but the
CPU doesn't support it, the error message is fairly cryptic:

  Error: unrecognized/unsupported processor variant (0x561f5811).

This messages is normally shown when there is an issue when comparing
the processor ID (CP15 0, c0, c0) with the values/masks described in
proc-v7.S. However, the same message is displayed when LPAE support is
enabled in the kernel configuration, but not available in the CPU,
after looking at ID_MMFR0 (CP15 0, c0, c1, 4). Having the same error
message is highly misleading.

This commit improves this by showing a different error message when
this situation occurs:

  Error: Kernel with LPAE support, but CPU does not support LPAE.
