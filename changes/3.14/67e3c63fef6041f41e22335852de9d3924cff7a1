ath10k: fix core init failpath

HIF was not stopped properly in
ath10k_core_start() upon failure. This could cause
memory leaks of CE completions entries and
possibly other issues as well.

Move the HIF start/stop out of
ath10k_htc_wait_target(). The ctl_resp completion
is already prepared in ath10k_htc_init.
