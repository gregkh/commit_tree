netpoll: fix netconsole IPv6 setup

Currently, to make netconsole start over IPv6, the source address
needs to be specified. Without a source address, netpoll_parse_options
assumes we're setting up over IPv4 and the destination IPv6 address is
rejected.

Check if the IP version has been forced by a source address before
checking for a version mismatch when parsing the destination address.
