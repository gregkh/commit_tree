ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Fix recording from mode id 0x8

Incorrect ADC is picked in ca0132_capture_pcm_prepare(),
where it assumes multiple streams while there is one stream
per ADC. Note that ca0132_capture_pcm_cleanup() already does
the right thing.

The Chromebook Pixel has a microphone under the keyboard that
is attached to node id 0x8. Before this fix, recording would
always go to the main internal mic (node id 0x7).
