crypto: aesni - AVX and AVX2 version of AESNI-GCM encode and decode

We have added AVX and AVX2 routines that optimize AESNI-GCM encode/decode.
These routines are optimized for encrypt and decrypt of large buffers.
In tests we have seen up to 6% speedup for 1K, 11% speedup for 2K and
18% speedup for 8K buffer over the existing SSE version.  These routines
should provide even better speedup for future Intel x86_64 cpus.
