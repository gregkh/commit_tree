blk-mq: rework I/O completions

Rework I/O completions to work more like the old code path.  blk_mq_end_io
now stays out of the business of deferring completions to others CPUs
and calling blk_mark_rq_complete.  The latter is very important to allow
completing requests that have timed out and thus are already marked completed,
the former allows using the IPI callout even for driver specific completions
instead of having to reimplement them.
