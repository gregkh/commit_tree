sysfs, kernfs: move symlink core code to fs/kernfs/symlink.c

Move core symlink code to fs/kernfs/symlink.c.  fs/sysfs/symlink.c now
only contains sysfs wrappers around kernfs interfaces.  The respective
declarations in fs/sysfs/sysfs.h are moved to
fs/kernfs/kernfs-internal.h.

This is pure relocation.
