xen/pvh: Piggyback on PVHVM for event channels (v2)

PVH is a PV guest with a twist - there are certain things
that work in it like HVM and some like PV. There is
a similar mode - PVHVM where we run in HVM mode with
PV code enabled - and this patch explores that.

The most notable PV interfaces are the XenBus and event channels.

We will piggyback on how the event channel mechanism is
used in PVHVM - that is we want the normal native IRQ mechanism
and we will install a vector (hvm callback) for which we
will call the event channel mechanism.

This means that from a pvops perspective, we can use
native_irq_ops instead of the Xen PV specific. Albeit in the
future we could support pirq_eoi_map. But that is
a feature request that can be shared with PVHVM.
