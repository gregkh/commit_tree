ARM: dts: Move MCT node to exynos4x12.dtsi

For MCT block compatible with "samsung,exynos4412-mct", that uses PPI
interrupts for local timers, only one local interrupt needs to be
specified, since it is a per-processor interrupt.

This allows moving MCT node of Exynos4x12 SoCs back to common
exynos4x12.dtsi, since they have the same set of interrupts to be
specified, which was the only difference.
