x86: dma-mapping: fix GFP_ATOMIC macro usage

GFP_ATOMIC is not a single gfp flag, but a macro which expands to the other
flags, where meaningful is the LACK of __GFP_WAIT flag. To check if caller
wants to perform an atomic allocation, the code must test for a lack of the
__GFP_WAIT flag. This patch fixes the issue introduced in v3.5-rc1.
