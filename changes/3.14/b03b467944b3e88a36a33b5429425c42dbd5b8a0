s390/uaccess: test if current->mm is set before walking page tables

If get_fs() == USER_DS we better test if current->mm is not zero before
walking page tables.
The page table walk code would try to lock mm->page_table_lock, however
if mm is zero this might crash.

Now it is arguably incorrect trying to access userspace if current->mm
is zero, however we have seen that and s390 would be the only architecture
which would crash in such a case.
So we better make the page table walk code a bit more robust and report
always a fault instead.
