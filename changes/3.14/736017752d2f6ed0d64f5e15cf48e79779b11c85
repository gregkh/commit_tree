KVM: PPC: Book3S: MMIO emulation support for little endian guests

MMIO emulation reads the last instruction executed by the guest
and then emulates. If the guest is running in Little Endian order,
or more generally in a different endian order of the host, the
instruction needs to be byte-swapped before being emulated.

This patch adds a helper routine which tests the endian order of
the host and the guest in order to decide whether a byteswap is
needed or not. It is then used to byteswap the last instruction
of the guest in the endian order of the host before MMIO emulation
is performed.

Finally, kvmppc_handle_load() of kvmppc_handle_store() are modified
to reverse the endianness of the MMIO if required.
