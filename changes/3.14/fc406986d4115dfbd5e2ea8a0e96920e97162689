staging: comedi: increment reference while file open

In the 'open' file operation handler `comedi_open()` in "comedi_fops.c",
call `comedi_dev_get_from_minor()` instead of `comedi_dev_from_minor()`
to get the pointer to the `struct comedi_device`.  This increments the
reference to prevent it being freed.  Call `comedi_dev_put()` to
decrement the reference  on failure, and also call it from the 'release'
file operation handler `comedi_close()`.
