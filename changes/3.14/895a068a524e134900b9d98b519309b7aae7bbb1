kernfs: make kernfs_get_active() block if the node is deactivated but not removed

Currently, kernfs_get_active() fails if the target node is
deactivated.  This is fine as a node always gets removed after
deactivation; however, we're gonna add reactivation so the assumption
won't hold.  It'd be incorrect for kernfs_get_active() to fail for a
node which was deactivated only temporarily.

This patch makes kernfs_get_active() block if the node is deactivated
but not removed.  If the node gets reactivated (not yet implemented),
it will be retried and succeed.  If the node gets removed, it will be
woken up and fail.
