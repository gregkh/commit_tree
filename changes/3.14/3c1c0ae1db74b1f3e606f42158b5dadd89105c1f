GFS2: Add directory addition info structure

The intent is that this structure will hold the information
required when adding entries to a directory (linking). To
start with, it will contain only the number of blocks which
are required to link the new entry into the directory. The
current calculation returns either 0 or the maximim number of
blocks that can ever be requested by such a transaction.

The intent is that in a later patch, we can update the dir
code to calculate this value more accurately. In addition
further patches will also add further fields to the new
structure to increase its utility.

In addition this patch fixes a bug where the link used during
inode creation was adding requesting too many blocks in
some cases. This is harmless unless the fs is close to being
full.
