x86, realmode: Pointer walk cleanups, pull out invariant use of __pa()

The pointer arithmetic in this function was really bizarre, where in
fact all we really wanted was a simple pointer array walk.  Use the
much more idiomatic construction for that (*ptr++).

Factor an invariant use of __pa() out of the relocation loop.  At
least on 64 bits it seems gcc isn't capable of doing that
automatically.

Change the scope of a couple of variables to make it extra obvious
that they are extremely local temp variables.
