Revert "usb: xhci: Link TRB must not occur within a USB payload burst"

This reverts commit 35773dac5f862cb1c82ea151eba3e2f6de51ec3e.  It's a
hack that caused regressions in the usb-storage and userspace USB
drivers that use usbfs and libusb.  Commit 70cabb7d992f "xhci 1.0: Limit
arbitrarily-aligned scatter gather." should fix the issues seen with the
ax88179_178a driver on xHCI 1.0 hosts, without causing regressions.
