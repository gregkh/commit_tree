bonding: fix bond_3ad_set_carrier() RCU usage

Currently, its usage is just plainly wrong. It first gets a slave under
RCU, and, after releasing the RCU lock, continues to use it - whilst it can
be freed.

Fix this by ensuring that bond_3ad_set_carrier() holds RCU till it uses its
slave (or its agg).
