<linux/phy.h>: coding style fixes

Running 'checkpatch.pl' gives some errors and warnings:

- no spaces around =;

- * separated by space from the function name;

- { in function definition not on a separate line;

- line over 80 characters.

While fixing these, also fix the following style issues:

- file name in the heading comment;

- alignment not matching open paren.
