ceph: check inode caps in ceph_d_revalidate

Some inodes in readdir reply may have no caps. Getattr mds request
for these inodes can return -ESTALE. The fix is consider dentry that
links to inode with no caps as invalid. Invalid dentry causes a
lookup request to send to the mds, the MDS will send caps back.
