staging: r8188eu: Fix sparse warning in core/rtw_pwrctrl.c

Sparse reports the following:

  CHECK   drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_pwrctrl.c
drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw_pwrctrl.c:525:6: warning: symbol 'rtw_free_pwrctrl_priv' was not declared. Should it be static?

That routine is not used and has been deleted.
