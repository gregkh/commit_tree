PCI/MSI: Add pci_enable_msi_range() and pci_enable_msix_range()

This adds pci_enable_msi_range(), which supersedes the pci_enable_msi()
and pci_enable_msi_block() MSI interfaces.

It also adds pci_enable_msix_range(), which supersedes the
pci_enable_msix() MSI-X interface.

The old interfaces have three categories of return values:

    negative: failure; caller should not retry
    positive: failure; value indicates number of interrupts that *could*
	have been allocated, and caller may retry with a smaller request
    zero: success; at least as many interrupts allocated as requested

It is error-prone to handle these three cases correctly in drivers.

The new functions return either a negative error code or a number of
successfully allocated MSI/MSI-X interrupts, which is expected to lead to
clearer device driver code.

pci_enable_msi(), pci_enable_msi_block() and pci_enable_msix() still exist
unchanged, but are deprecated and may be removed after callers are updated.
