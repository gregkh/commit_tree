gpio: davinci: use chained_irq_enter/chained_irq_exit API

It's unsafe to call IRQ chip callbacks (.irq_mask/irq_unmask/irq_ack)
from chained IRQ handler directly. Because, Davinci GPIO block is used
by different SoCs, which, in turn, have different Main IRQ controllers
(Davinci - aintc, cp-intc; Keystone - arm-gic) which may introduce
diffrent set of IRQ chip callbacks. As result, call of
gpio_irq_handler() on Keysone will simply cause crash the system,
because ARM-GIC implements .irq_eoi() instead of .irq_ack().

Hence, fix it by using Kernel chained_irq_enter/chained_irq_exit APIs as
they are intended to handle exact such cases.
