ACPI / hotplug: Introduce common hotplug function acpi_device_hotplug()

Modify the common ACPI device hotplug code to always queue up the
same function, acpi_device_hotplug(), using acpi_hotplug_execute()
and make the PCI host bridge hotplug code use that function too for
device hot removal.

This allows some code duplication to be reduced and a race condition
where the relevant ACPI handle may become invalid between the
notification handler and the function queued up by it via
acpi_hotplug_execute() to be avoided.
