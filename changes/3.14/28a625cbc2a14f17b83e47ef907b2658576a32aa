fuse: fix pipe_buf_operations

Having this struct in module memory could Oops when if the module is
unloaded while the buffer still persists in a pipe.

Since sock_pipe_buf_ops is essentially the same as fuse_dev_pipe_buf_steal
merge them into nosteal_pipe_buf_ops (this is the same as
default_pipe_buf_ops except stealing the page from the buffer is not
allowed).
