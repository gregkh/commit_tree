netfilter: nft_ct: Add support to set the connmark

This patch adds kernel support for setting properties of tracked
connections. Currently, only connmark is supported. One use-case
for this feature is to provide the same functionality as
-j CONNMARK --save-mark in iptables.

Some restructuring was needed to implement the set op. The new
structure follows that of nft_meta.
