agp/intel: Support 64-bit GMADR

Per the Intel 915G/915GV/... Chipset spec (document number 301467-005),
GMADR is a standard PCI BAR.

The PCI core reads GMADR at enumeration-time.  Use pci_bus_address()
instead of reading it again in the driver.  This works correctly for both
32-bit and 64-bit BARs.  The spec above only mentions 32-bit GMADR, but
Yinghai's patch (link below) indicates some devices have a 64-bit GMADR.
