powerpc/eeh: Use global PCI rescan-remove locking

Race conditions are theoretically possible between the PCI device addition
and removal in the PPC64 PCI error recovery driver and the generic PCI bus
rescan and device removal that can be triggered via sysfs.

To avoid those race conditions make PPC64 PCI error recovery driver use
global PCI rescan-remove locking around PCI device addition and removal.
