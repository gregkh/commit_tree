checkpatch: add DT compatible string documentation checks

This adds a simple check that any compatible strings in DeviceTree dts
files are present in Documentation/devicetree/bindings.  Vendor prefixes
are also checked for existing in vendor-prefixes.txt These should be
temporary checks until we have more sophisticated binding schema
checking.
