timekeeping: Fix potential lost pv notification of time change

In 780427f0e11 (Indicate that clock was set in the pvclock
gtod notifier), logic was added to pass a CLOCK_WAS_SET
notification to the pvclock notifier chain.

While that patch added a action flag returned from
accumulate_nsecs_to_secs(), it only uses the returned value
in one location, and not in the logarithmic accumulation.

This means if a leap second triggered during the logarithmic
accumulation (which is most likely where it would happen),
the notification that the clock was set would not make it to
the pv notifiers.

This patch extends the logarithmic_accumulation pass down
that action flag so proper notification will occur.

This patch also changes the varialbe action -> clock_set
per Ingo's suggestion.
