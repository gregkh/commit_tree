gpio: better lookup method for platform GPIOs

Change the format of the platform GPIO lookup tables to make them less
confusing and improve lookup efficiency.

The previous format was a single linked-list that required to compare
the device name and function ID of every single GPIO defined for each
lookup. Switch that to a list of per-device tables, so that the lookup
can be done in two steps, omitting the GPIOs that are not relevant for a
particular device.

The matching rules are now defined as follows:
- The device name must match *exactly*, and can be NULL for GPIOs not
  assigned to a particular device,
- If the function ID in the lookup table is NULL, the con_id argument of
  gpiod_get() will not be used for lookup. However, if it is defined, it
  must match exactly.
- The index must always match.
