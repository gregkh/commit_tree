rtlwifi: Fix incorrect return from rtl_ps_enable_nic()

rtl_ps_enable_nic() is called from loops that will loop until this function returns true or a
maximum number of retries is performed.

hw_init() returns non-zero on error. In that situation return false to
restore the original design intent to retry hw init when it fails.
