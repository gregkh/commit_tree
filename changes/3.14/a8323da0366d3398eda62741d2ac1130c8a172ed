    dcache: Translating dentry into pathname without taking rename_lock

The __dentry_path locking was changed and the variable error was
intended to be moved outside of the loop.  Unfortunately the inner
declaration of error was not removed. Resulting in a version of
__dentry_path that will never return an error.

Remove the problematic inner declaration of error and allow
__dentry_path to return errors once again.
