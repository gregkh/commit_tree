work around xmlto bug in htmldocs

Trying to generate xhtml causes all functions to show up with a prefix
of "fsfunc" in the output, so just back off to html until someone
fixes the toolchain.

Note that this is not a problem with kernel-doc, it's an issue with
however "xmlto" renders xhtml output.
