md: check command validity early in md_ioctl().

Verify that the cmd parameter passed to md_ioctl() is valid before
doing anything.

This fixes mddev->hold_active being set to 0 when an invalid ioctl
command is passed to md_ioctl() before the array has been configured.

Clearing mddev->hold_active in that case can lead to a livelock
situation when an invalid ioctl number is given to md_ioctl() by a
process when the mddev is currently being opened by another process:

Process 1				Process 2
---------				---------

md_alloc()
  mddev_find()
  -> returns a new mddev with
     hold_active == UNTIL_IOCTL
  add_disk()
  -> sends KOBJ_ADD uevent

					(sees KOBJ_ADD uevent for device)
                    			md_open()
                    			md_ioctl(INVALID_IOCTL)
                    			-> returns ENODEV and clears
                       			   mddev->hold_active
                    			md_release()
                      			md_put()
                      			-> deletes the mddev as
                         		   hold_active is 0

md_open()
  mddev_find()
  -> returns a newly
    allocated mddev with
    mddev->gendisk == NULL
-> returns with ERESTARTSYS
   (kernel restarts the open syscall)
