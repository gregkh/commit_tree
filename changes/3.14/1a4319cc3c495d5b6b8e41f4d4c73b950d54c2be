Btrfs: fix extent state leak on transaction abortion

When transaction is aborted, we fail to commit transaction, instead we do
cleanup work.  After that when we umount btrfs, we get to free fs roots' log
trees respectively, but that happens after we unpin extents, so those extents
pinned by freeing log trees will remain in memory and lead to the leak.
