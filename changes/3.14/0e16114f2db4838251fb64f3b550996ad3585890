USB: Nokia 502 is an unusual device

The USB storage operation of Nokia Asha 502 Dual SIM smartphone running Asha
Platform 1.1.1 is unreliable in respect of data consistency (i.e. transfered
files are corrupted). A similar issue is described here:
http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Asha-and-other-Nokia-Series-30/Nokia-301-USB-transfers-and-corrupted-files/td-p/1974170

The workaround is (MAX_SECTORS_64):
   rmmod usb_storage && modprobe usb_storage quirks=0421:06aa:m

The patch adds the tested device to the unusual list permanently.
