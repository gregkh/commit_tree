parisc/sti_console: prefer Linux fonts over built-in ROM fonts

The built-in ROM fonts lack many necessary ASCII characters, which is
why it makes sens to prefer the Linux fonts instead if they are
available.  This makes consoles on STI graphics cards which are not
supported by the stifb driver (e.g. Visualize FXe) looks much nicer.
