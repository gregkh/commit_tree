drm/i915: Try to fix the messy IVB sprite scaling workaround

We now have a very clear method of disabling LP1+ wartermarks,
and we can actually detect if we actually did disable them, or
if they were already disabled. Use that to clean up the
WaCxSRDisabledForSpriteScaling:ivb handling.

I was hoping to apply the workaround in a way that wouldn't
require a blocking wait, but sadly IVB really does appear to
require LP1+ watermarks to be off for an entire frame before
enabling sprite scaling. Simply disabling LP1+ watermarks
during the previous frame is not enough, no matter how early
in the frame we do it :(
