iwlwifi: mvm: change of listen interval from 70 to 10

Some APs reject STA association request if a listen interval value exceeds
a threshold of 10. Thus, for example, Cisco APs may deny STA associations
returning status code 12 (Association denied due to reason outside the scope
of 802.11 standard) in the association response frame.

Fixing the issue by setting the default IWL_CONN_MAX_LISTEN_INTERVAL value
from 70 to 10.
