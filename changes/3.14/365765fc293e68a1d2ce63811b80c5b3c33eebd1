drm/tegra: Track HDMI enable state

The DRM core doesn't track enable and disable state of encoders and/or
connectors, so calls to the output's .enable() and .disable() are not
guaranteed to be balanced. Track the enable state internally so that
calls to regulator and clock frameworks remain balanced.
