perf: Fix hotplug splat

Drew Richardson reported that he could make the kernel go *boom* when hotplugging
while having perf events active.

It turned out that when you have a group event, the code in
__perf_event_exit_context() fails to remove the group siblings from
the context.

We then proceed with destroying and freeing the event, and when you
re-plug the CPU and try and add another event to that CPU, things go
*boom* because you've still got dead entries there.
