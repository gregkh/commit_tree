xfs: ensure correct timestamp updates from truncate

The VFS doesn't set the proper ATTR_CTIME and ATTR_MTIME values for
truncate, so filesystems have to manually add them.  The
introduction of xfs_setattr_time accidentally broke this special
case an caused a regression in generic/313.  Fix this by removing
the local mask variable in xfs_setattr_size so that we only have a
single place to keep the attribute information.
