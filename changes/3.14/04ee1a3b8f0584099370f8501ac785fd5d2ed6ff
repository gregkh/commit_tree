audit: get rid of *NO* daemon at audit_pid=0 message

kauditd_send_skb is called after audit_pid was checked to be non-zero.

However, it can be set to 0 due to auditd exiting while kauditd_send_skb
is still executed and this can result in a spurious warning about missing
auditd.

Re-check audit_pid before printing the message.
