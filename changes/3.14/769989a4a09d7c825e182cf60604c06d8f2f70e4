[SCSI] st: fix enlarge_buffer

This patch removes a bug in enlarge_buffer() that can make a
read or write fail under special conditions.

After changing TRY_DIRECT_IO to 0 and ST_MAX_SG to 32 in
st_options.h, a program that writes a first block of 128k and
than a second bigger block (e.g. 256k) fails. The second write
returns errno EOVERFLOW, as enlarge_buffer() checks the sg list
and detects that it already is full.
As enlarge_buffer uses different page allocation orders
depending on the size of the buffer needed, the check does not
make sense.
