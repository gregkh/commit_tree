usb: core: Fix potential memory leak adding dyn USBdevice IDs

Fix a memory leak in the usb_store_new_id() error paths. When bailing out
due to sanity checks, the function left the already allocated usb_dynid
struct in place. This regression was introduced by the following commits:

c63fe8f6 (usb: core: add sanity checks when using bInterfaceClass with new_id)
1b9fb31f (usb: core: check for valid id_table when using the RefId feature)
52a6966c (usb: core: bail out if user gives an unknown RefId when using new_id)

Detected by Coverity: CID 1162604.
