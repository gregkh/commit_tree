batman-adv: fix potential kernel paging error for unicast transmissions

batadv_send_skb_prepare_unicast(_4addr) might reallocate the
skb's data. If it does then our ethhdr pointer is not valid
anymore in batadv_send_skb_unicast(), resulting in a kernel
paging error.

Fixing this by refetching the ethhdr pointer after the
potential reallocation.
