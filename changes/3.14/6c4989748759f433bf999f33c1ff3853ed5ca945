net: mvneta: remove tests for impossible cases in the tx_done path

Currently, mvneta_txq_bufs_free() calls mvneta_tx_done_policy() with
a non-null cause to retrieve the pointer to the next queue to process.
There are useless tests on the return queue number and on the pointer,
all of which are well defined within a known limited set. This code
path is fast, although not critical. Removing 3 tests here that the
compiler could not optimize (verified) is always desirable.
