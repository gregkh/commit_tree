ALSA: hda - add headset mic detect quirks for some Dell machines

When we plug a 3-ring headset on some Dell machines, the headset
mic can't be detected, after apply this patch, the headset mic
can work well on all those machines.

On the machine with the Subsytem ID 0x10280610, if we use
ALC269_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE, the headset mic can be
detected and work well, but the sound can't be outputed via
headphone anymore, use ALC269_FIXUP_DELL3_MIC_NO_PRESENCE
can fix this problem.
