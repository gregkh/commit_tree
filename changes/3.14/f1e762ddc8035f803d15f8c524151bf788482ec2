ALSA: hda - Enable stereo mix as default for AD and VIA codecs

AD and VIA codecs had stereo mixer input enabled as default before
moving to the generic parser, and people think the lack of such a
regression.  In this patch, the stereo mixer input is added back to
the input selection if no auto-mic is available, and if it's not
disabled explicitly via hint.  This should satisfy most of demands,
i.e. stereo mix on desktop machines like what it worked before, and it
still keeps the new auto-mic feature on laptops.
