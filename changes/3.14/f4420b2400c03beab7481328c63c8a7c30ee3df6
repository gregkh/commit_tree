staging/lustre/pinger: remove never implemented suspend timeouts functionality

This is part of original Lustre tree commit. It removes never implemented
suspend timeouts functionality from pinger.c which was commented out
since 2007 and going to be replaced by adaptive timeouts. Also removed all
references to this functionality from ldlm_lockd.c, ldlm_request.c and
import.c which actually nevers executes or do nothing.
