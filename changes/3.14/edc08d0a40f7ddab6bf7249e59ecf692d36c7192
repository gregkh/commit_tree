drm/i915: Fix gen3/4 vblank counter wraparound

When the hardware frame counter reads 0xffffff and we're already past
vblank start, we'd return 0x1000000 as the vblank counter value. Once
we'd cross into the next frame's active portion, the vblank counter
would wrap to 0. So we're reporting two different vblank counter values
for the same frame.

Fix the problem by masking the cooked value by 0xffffff to make sure
the counter wraps already after vblank start.
