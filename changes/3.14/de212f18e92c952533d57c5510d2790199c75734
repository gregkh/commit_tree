sched/deadline: Fix hotplug admission control

The current hotplug admission control is broken because:

  CPU_DYING -> migration_call() -> migrate_tasks() -> __migrate_task()

cannot fail and hard assumes it _will_ move all tasks off of the dying
cpu, failing this will break hotplug.

The much simpler solution is a DOWN_PREPARE handler that fails when
removing one CPU gets us below the total allocated bandwidth.
