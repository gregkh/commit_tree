drm/i915: change CRTC assertion on LCPLL disable

Currently, PC8 is enabled at modeset_global_resources, which is called
after intel_modeset_update_state. Due to this, there's a small race
condition on the case where we start enabling PC8, then do a modeset
while PC8 is still being enabled. The racing condition triggers a WARN
because intel_modeset_update_state will mark the CRTC as enabled, then
the thread that's still enabling PC8 might look at the data structure
and think that PC8 is being enabled while a pipe is enabled. Despite
the WARN, this is not really a bug since we'll wait for the
PC8-enabling thread to finish when we call modeset_global_resources.

The spec says the CRTC cannot be enabled when we disable LCPLL, so we
had a check for crtc->base.enabled. If we change to crtc->active we
will still prevent disabling LCPLL while the CRTC is enabled, and we
will also prevent the WARN above.

This is a replacement for the previous patch named
    "drm/i915: get/put PC8 when we get/put a CRTC"
