mac80211: consolidate calls to plink_frame_tx

Do all frame transfers in one place at the end of the
big switch statements.  sta->plid and sta->reason can
be passed in any case, since they are only used for
the frames that need them.  Remove assignments to locals
for values already stored in the sta structure.
