powernow-k6: correctly initialize default parameters

The powernow-k6 driver used to read the initial multiplier from the
powernow register. However, there is a problem with this:

* If there was a frequency transition before, the multiplier read from the
  register corresponds to the current multiplier.
* If there was no frequency transition since reset, the field in the
  register always reads as zero, regardless of the current multiplier that
  is set using switches on the mainboard and that the CPU is running at.

The zero value corresponds to multiplier 4.5, so as a consequence, the
powernow-k6 driver always assumes multiplier 4.5.

For example, if we have 550MHz CPU with bus frequency 100MHz and
multiplier 5.5, the powernow-k6 driver thinks that the multiplier is 4.5
and bus frequency is 122MHz. The powernow-k6 driver then sets the
multiplier to 4.5, underclocking the CPU to 450MHz, but reports the
current frequency as 550MHz.

There is no reliable way how to read the initial multiplier. I modified
the driver so that it contains a table of known frequencies (based on
parameters of existing CPUs and some common overclocking schemes) and sets
the multiplier according to the frequency. If the frequency is unknown
(because of unusual overclocking or underclocking), the user must supply
the bus speed and maximum multiplier as module parameters.

This patch should be backported to all stable kernels. If it doesn't
apply cleanly, change it, or ask me to change it.
