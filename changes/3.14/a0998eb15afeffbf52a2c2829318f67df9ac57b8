efi: Export more EFI table variables to sysfs

Export fw_vendor, runtime and config table physical addresses to
/sys/firmware/efi/{fw_vendor,runtime,config_table} because kexec kernels
need them.

From EFI spec these 3 variables will be updated to virtual address after
entering virtual mode. But kernel startup code will need the physical
address.
