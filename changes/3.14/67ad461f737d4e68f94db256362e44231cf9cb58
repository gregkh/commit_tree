arm64: vmlinux.lds.S: drop redundant .comment

We currently try to emit .comment twice, once in STABS_DEBUG, and once
in the line immediately following it. As the two section definitions are
identical, the latter is redundant and can be dropped.

This patch drops the redundant .comment section definition.
