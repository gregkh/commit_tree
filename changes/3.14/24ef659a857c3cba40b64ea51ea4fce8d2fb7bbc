rcu: Provide better diagnostics for blocking in RCU callback functions

Currently blocking in an RCU callback function will result in
"scheduling while atomic", which could be triggered for any number
of reasons.  To aid debugging, this patch introduces a rcu_callback_map
that is used to tie the inappropriate voluntary context switch back
to the fact that the function is being invoked from within a callback.
