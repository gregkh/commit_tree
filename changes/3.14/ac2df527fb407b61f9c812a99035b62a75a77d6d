clk: Add common __clk_get(), __clk_put() implementations

This patch adds common __clk_get(), __clk_put() clkdev helpers that
replace their platform specific counterparts when the common clock
API is used.

The owner module pointer field is added to struct clk so a reference
to the clock supplier module can be taken by the clock consumers.

The owner module is assigned while the clock is being registered,
in functions _clk_register() and __clk_register().
