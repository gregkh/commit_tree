i2c: cpm: Fix build by adding of_address.h and of_irq.h

Fixes a build break due to the undeclared use of irq_of_parse_and_map()
and of_iomap().  This build break was apparently introduced while the
driver was unbuildable due to the bug fixed by
62c19c9d29e65086e5ae76df371ed2e6b23f00cd ("i2c: Remove usage of
orphaned symbol OF_I2C").  When 62c19c was added in v3.14-rc7,
the driver was enabled again, breaking the powerpc mpc85xx_defconfig
and mpc85xx_smp_defconfig.

62c19c is marked for stable, so this should go there as well.
