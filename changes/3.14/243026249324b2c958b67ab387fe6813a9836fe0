drm/i915: Fix scanline counter fixup on BDW

The display interrupts changed on BDW, so the current ILK-HSW specific
code in ilk_pipe_in_vblank_locked() doesn't work there. Add the required
bits for BDW, and while at it, change the existing code to use nicer
looking vblank status bit macros.

Also remove the now stale __raw_i915_read16() definition which was
left over from the failed gen2 ISR experiment.
