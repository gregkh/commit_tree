gpio / ACPI: register to ACPI events automatically

Instead of asking each driver to register to ACPI events we can just call
acpi_gpiochip_register_interrupts() for each chip that has an ACPI handle.
The function checks chip->to_irq and if it is set to NULL (a GPIO driver
that doesn't do interrupts) the function does nothing.

We also add the a new header drivers/gpio/gpiolib.h that is used for
functions internal to gpiolib and add ACPI GPIO chip registering functions
to that header.

Once that is done we can remove call to acpi_gpiochip_register_interrupts()
from its only user, pinctrl-baytrail.c
