tracing/uprobes: Add @+file_offset fetch method

Enable to fetch data from a file offset.  Currently it only supports
fetching from same binary uprobe set.  It'll translate the file offset
to a proper virtual address in the process.

The syntax is "@+OFFSET" as it does similar to normal memory fetching
(@ADDR) which does no address translation.
