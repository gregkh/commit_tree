ARM: OMAP4: hwmod: Fix SOFTRESET logic for OMAP4

Commit 313a76e (ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix SOFTRESET logic) introduced
softreset bit cleaning right after set one. It is caused L3 error for
OMAP4 ISS because ISS register write occurs when ISS reset process is in
progress. Avoid this situation by cleaning softreset bit later, when reset
process is successfully finished.
