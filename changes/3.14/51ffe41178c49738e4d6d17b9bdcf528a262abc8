cpuset: convert away from cftype->read()

In preparation of conversion to kernfs, cgroup file handling is being
consolidated so that it can be easily mapped to the seq_file based
interface of kernfs.

All users of cftype->read() can be easily served, usually better, by
seq_file and other methods.  Rename cpuset_common_file_read() to
cpuset_common_read_seq_string() and convert it to use
read_seq_string() interface instead.  This not only simplifies the
code but also makes it more versatile.  Before, the file couldn't
output if the result is longer than PAGE_SIZE.  After the conversion,
seq_file automatically grows the buffer until the output can fit.

This patch doesn't make any visible behavior changes except for being
able to handle output larger than PAGE_SIZE.
