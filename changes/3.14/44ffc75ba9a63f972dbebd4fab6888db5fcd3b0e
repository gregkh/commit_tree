cgroup, sched: convert away from cftype->read_map()

In preparation of conversion to kernfs, cgroup file handling is being
consolidated so that it can be easily mapped to the seq_file based
interface of kernfs.

cftype->read_map() doesn't add any value and being replaced with
->read_seq_string().  Update cpu_stats_show() and cpuacct_stats_show()
accordingly.

This patch doesn't make any visible behavior changes.
