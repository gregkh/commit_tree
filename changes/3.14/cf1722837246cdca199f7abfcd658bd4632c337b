net/ipv4: don't use module_init in non-modular gre_offload

Recent commit 438e38fadca2f6e57eeecc08326c8a95758594d4
("gre_offload: statically build GRE offloading support") added
new module_init/module_exit calls to the gre_offload.c file.

The file is obj-y and can't be anything other than built-in.
Currently it can never be built modular, so using module_init
as an alias for __initcall can be somewhat misleading.

Fix this up now, so that we can relocate module_init from
init.h into module.h in the future.  If we don't do this, we'd
have to add module.h to obviously non-modular code, and that
would be a worse thing.  We also make the inclusion explicit.

Note that direct use of __initcall is discouraged, vs. one
of the priority categorized subgroups.  As __initcall gets
mapped onto device_initcall, our use of device_initcall
directly in this change means that the runtime impact is
zero -- it will remain at level 6 in initcall ordering.

As for the module_exit, rather than replace it with __exitcall,
we simply remove it, since it appears only UML does anything
with those, and even for UML, there is no relevant cleanup
to be done here.
