ARM: shmobile: Sync Koelsch DTS with Koelsch reference DTS

Copy the device nodes from Koelsch reference into the Koeslch device
tree file. This will allow us to use a single DTS file regarless of
kernel configuration. In case of legacy C board code the device nodes
may or may not be used, but in the multiplatform case all the DT device
nodes are used.
