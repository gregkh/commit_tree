smp.h: fix x86+cpu.c sparse warnings about arch nonboot CPU calls

Use what we already do for arch_disable_smp_support() to fix these:

  arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:1155:6: warning: symbol 'arch_enable_nonboot_cpus_begin' was not declared. Should it be static?
  arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:1160:6: warning: symbol 'arch_enable_nonboot_cpus_end' was not declared. Should it be static?
  kernel/cpu.c:512:13: warning: symbol 'arch_enable_nonboot_cpus_begin' was not declared. Should it be static?
  kernel/cpu.c:516:13: warning: symbol 'arch_enable_nonboot_cpus_end' was not declared. Should it be static?
