ACPI / hotplug: Make ACPI PCI root hotplug use common hotplug code

Rework the common ACPI device hotplug code so that it is suitable
for PCI host bridge hotplug and switch the PCI host bridge scan
handler to using the common hotplug code.

This allows quite a few lines of code that are not necessary any more
to be dropped from the PCI host bridge scan handler and removes
arbitrary differences in behavior between PCI host bridge hotplug
and ACPI-based hotplug of other components, like CPUs and memory.

Also acpi_device_hotplug() can be static now.
