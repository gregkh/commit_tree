libceph: update ceph_features.h

This updates ceph_features.h so that it has all feature bits defined in
ceph.git.  In the interim since the last update, ceph.git crossed the
"32 feature bits" point, and, the addition of the 33rd bit wasn't
handled correctly.  The work-around is squashed into this commit and
reflects ceph.git commit 053659d05e0349053ef703b414f44965f368b9f0.
