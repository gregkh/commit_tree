ASoC: fsl_ssi: Add monaural audio support for non-ac97 interface

The normal mode of SSI allows it to send/receive data to/from the first
slot of each period. So we can use this normal mode to trick I2S signal
by puting/getting data to/from the first slot only (the left channel)
so as to support monaural audio playback and recording.
