clk: composite: pass mux_hw into determine_rate

The composite clock's .determine_rate implementation can call the
underyling .determine_rate callback corresponding to rate_hw or the
underlying .determine_rate callback corresponding to mux_hw. In both
cases we pass in rate_hw, which is wrong. Fixed by passing mux_hw into
the correct callback.
