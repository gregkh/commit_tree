powerpc/pseries: Add Gen3 definitions for PCIE link speed

Rev3 of the PCI Express Base Specification defines a Supported Link
Speeds Vector where the bit definitions within this field are:

Bit 0 - 2.5 GT/s
Bit 1 - 5.0 GT/s
Bit 2 - 8.0 GT/s

This vector definition is used by the platform firmware to export the
maximum and current link speeds of the PCI bus via the
"ibm,pcie-link-speed-stats" device-tree property.

This patch updates pseries_root_bridge_prepare() to detect Gen3
speed buses (defined by 0x04).
