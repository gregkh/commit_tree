perf trace: Fix summary percentage when processing files

Getting a divide by 0 when events are processed from a file:

   perf trace -i perf.data -s
   ...
   dnsmasq (1684), 10 events, inf%, 0.000 msec

The problem is that the event count is not incremented as events are
processed. With this patch:

   perf trace -i perf.data -s
   ...
   dnsmasq (1684), 10 events, 8.9%, 0.000 msec
