hso: remove some dead code

It seems like this function was intended to have special handling for
urb statuses of -ENOENT and -ECONNRESET.  But now it just prints some
debugging and returns at the start of the function.

I have removed the dead code, it's still in the git history if anyone
wants to revive it.
