audit: refactor audit_receive_msg() to clarify AUDIT_*_RULE* cases

audit_receive_msg() needlessly contained a fallthrough case that called
audit_receive_filter(), containing no common code between the cases.  Separate
them to make the logic clearer.  Refactor AUDIT_LIST_RULES, AUDIT_ADD_RULE,
AUDIT_DEL_RULE cases to create audit_rule_change(), audit_list_rules_send()
functions.  This should not functionally change the logic.
