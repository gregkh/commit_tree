tuntap: Fix for a race in accessing numqueues

A patch for fixing a race between queue selection and changing queues
was introduced in commit 92bb73ea2("tuntap: fix a possible race between
queue selection and changing queues").

The fix was to prevent the driver from re-reading the tun->numqueues
more than once within tun_select_queue() using ACCESS_ONCE().

We have been experiancing 'Divide-by-zero' errors in tun_net_xmit()
since we moved from 3.6 to 3.10, and believe that they come from a
simular source where the value of tun->numqueues changes to zero
between the first and a subsequent read of tun->numqueues.

The fix is a simular use of ACCESS_ONCE(), as well as a multiply
instead of a divide in the if statement.
