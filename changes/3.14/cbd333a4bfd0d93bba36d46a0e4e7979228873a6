KVM: arm-vgic: Support unqueueing of LRs to the dist

To properly access the VGIC state from user space it is very unpractical
to have to loop through all the LRs in all register access functions.
Instead, support moving all pending state from LRs to the distributor,
but leave active state LRs alone.

Note that to accurately present the active and pending state to VCPUs
reading these distributor registers from a live VM, we would have to
stop all other VPUs than the calling VCPU and ask each CPU to unqueue
their LR state onto the distributor and add fields to track active state
on the distributor side as well.  We don't have any users of such
functionality yet and there are other inaccuracies of the GIC emulation,
so don't provide accurate synchronized access to this state just yet.
However, when the time comes, having this function should help.
