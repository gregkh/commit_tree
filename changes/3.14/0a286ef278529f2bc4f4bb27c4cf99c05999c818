HID: sony: Add LED support for Sixaxis/Dualshock3 USB

The PS3 Sixaxis controller has 4 LEDs which can be controlled using the same
command as the rumble functionality. It seems not to be possible to only change
the LED without modifying the rumble motor state. Thus both have to be stored
on the host and retransmitted when either the LED or rumble state is changed.

Third party controllers may not support to disable all LEDs at once. These
controllers automatically switch to blinking of all LEDs when no LED is active
anymore.
