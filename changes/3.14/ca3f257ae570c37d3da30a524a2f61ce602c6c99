KVM: nVMX: Support direct APIC access from L2

It's a pathological case, but still a valid one: If L1 disables APIC
virtualization and also allows L2 to directly write to the APIC page, we
have to forcibly enable APIC virtualization while in L2 if the in-kernel
APIC is in use.

This allows to run the direct interrupt test case in the vmx unit test
without x2APIC.
