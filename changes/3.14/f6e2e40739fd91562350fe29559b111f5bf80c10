drivers: gpu: Add static keyword to the definition of KMS_INVALID_IOCTL in radeon_kms.c

Add static keyword to the definition of KMS_INVALID_IOCTL(name) in
radeon_kms.c because the functions passed to it as arguments are not
used anywhere else.

This eliminates the following warnings in drm/radeon/radeon_kms.c:
