[media] s5p-jpeg: Fix clock resource management

Standard suspend/resume path is called after runtime resume
of the given device, so suspend/resume callbacks must do all
clock management done also by runtime pm to allow for proper
power domain shutdown. Moreover, JPEG clock is enabled from
probe function but is is not necessary. This patch also moves
control of jpeg clock to runtime_pm callbacks.
