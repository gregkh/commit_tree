exec:check_unsafe_exec: use while_each_thread() rather than next_thread()

next_thread() should be avoided, change check_unsafe_exec() to use
while_each_thread().

Nobody except signal->curr_target actually needs next_thread-like code,
and we need to change (fix) this interface.  This particular code is fine,
p == current.  But in general the code like this can loop forever if p
exits and next_thread(t) can't reach the unhashed thread.

This also saves 32 bytes.
