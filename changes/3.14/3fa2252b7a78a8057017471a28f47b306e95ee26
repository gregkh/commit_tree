clk: Add set_rate_and_parent() op

Some of Qualcomm's clocks can change their parent and rate at the
same time with a single register write. Add support for this
hardware to the common clock framework by adding a new
set_rate_and_parent() op. When the clock framework determines
that both the parent and the rate are going to change during
clk_set_rate() it will call the .set_rate_and_parent() op if
available and fall back to calling .set_parent() followed by
.set_rate() otherwise.
