ipv6: router reachability probing

RFC 4191 states in 3.5:

   When a host avoids using any non-reachable router X and instead sends
   a data packet to another router Y, and the host would have used
   router X if router X were reachable, then the host SHOULD probe each
   such router X's reachability by sending a single Neighbor
   Solicitation to that router's address.  A host MUST NOT probe a
   router's reachability in the absence of useful traffic that the host
   would have sent to the router if it were reachable.  In any case,
   these probes MUST be rate-limited to no more than one per minute per
   router.

Currently, when the neighbour corresponding to a router falls into
NUD_FAILED, it's never considered again. Introduce a new rt6_nud_state
value, RT6_NUD_FAIL_PROBE, which suggests the route should not be used but
should be probed with a single NS. The probe is ratelimited by the existing
code. To better distinguish meanings of the failure values, rename
RT6_NUD_FAIL_SOFT to RT6_NUD_FAIL_DO_RR.
