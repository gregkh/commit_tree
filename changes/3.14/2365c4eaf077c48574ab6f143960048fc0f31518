CIFS: Fix too big maxBuf size for SMB3 mounts

SMB3 servers can respond with MaxTransactSize of more than 4M
that can cause a memory allocation error returned from kmalloc
in a lock codepath. Also the client doesn't support multicredit
requests now and allows buffer sizes of 65536 bytes only. Set
MaxTransactSize to this maximum supported value.
