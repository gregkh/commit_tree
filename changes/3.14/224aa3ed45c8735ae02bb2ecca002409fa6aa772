clocksource: vf_pit_timer: use complement for sched_clock reading

Vybrids PIT register is monitonic decreasing. However, sched_clock
reading needs to be monitonic increasing. Use bitwise not to get
the complement of the clock register. This fixes the clock going
backward. Also, the clock now starts at 0 since we load the
register with the maximum value at start.
