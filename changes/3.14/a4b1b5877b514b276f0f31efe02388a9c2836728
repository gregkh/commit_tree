HID: Bluetooth: hidp: make sure input buffers are big enough

HID core expects the input buffers to be at least of size 4096
(HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE). Other sizes will result in buffer-overflows if an
input-report is smaller than advertised. We could, like i2c, compute the
biggest report-size instead of using HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, but this will
blow up if report-descriptors are changed after ->start() has been called.
So lets be safe and just use the biggest buffer we have.

Note that this adds an additional copy to the HIDP input path. If there is
a way to make sure the skb-buf is big enough, we should use that instead.

The best way would be to make hid-core honor the @size argument, though,
that sounds easier than it is. So lets just fix the buffer-overflows for
now and afterwards look for a faster way for all transport drivers.
