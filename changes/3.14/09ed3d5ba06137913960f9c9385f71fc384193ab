xen/balloon: flush persistent kmaps in correct position

Xen balloon driver will update ballooned out pages' P2M entries to point
to scratch page for PV guests. In 24f69373e2 ("xen/balloon: don't alloc
page while non-preemptible", kmap_flush_unused was moved after updating
P2M table. In that case for 32 bit PV guest we might end up with

  P2M    X -----> S  (S is mfn of balloon scratch page)
  M2P    Y -----> X  (Y is mfn in persistent kmap entry)

kmap_flush_unused() iterates through all the PTEs in the kmap address
space, using pte_to_page() to obtain the page. If the p2m and the m2p
are inconsistent the incorrect page is returned.  This will clear
page->address on the wrong page which may cause subsequent oopses if
that page is currently kmap'ed.

Move the flush back between get_page and __set_phys_to_machine to fix
this.
