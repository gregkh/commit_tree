dm thin: add mappings to end of prepared_* lists

Mappings could be processed in descending logical block order,
particularly if buffered IO is used.  This could adversely affect the
latency of IO processing.  Fix this by adding mappings to the end of the
'prepared_mappings' and 'prepared_discards' lists.
