tracing: Add 'stacktrace' event trigger command

Add 'stacktrace' event_command.  stacktrace event triggers are added
by the user via this command in a similar way and using practically
the same syntax as the analogous 'stacktrace' ftrace function command,
but instead of writing to the set_ftrace_filter file, the stacktrace
event trigger is written to the per-event 'trigger' files:

    echo 'stacktrace' > .../tracing/events/somesys/someevent/trigger

The above command will turn on stacktraces for someevent i.e. whenever
someevent is hit, a stacktrace will be logged.

This also adds a 'count' version that limits the number of times the
command will be invoked:

    echo 'stacktrace:N' > .../tracing/events/somesys/someevent/trigger

Where N is the number of times the command will be invoked.

The above command will log N stacktraces for someevent i.e. whenever
someevent is hit N times, a stacktrace will be logged.
