efi: Export EFI runtime memory mapping to sysfs

kexec kernel will need exactly same mapping for EFI runtime memory
ranges. Thus here export the runtime ranges mapping to sysfs,
kexec-tools will assemble them and pass to 2nd kernel via setup_data.

Introducing a new directory /sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map just like
/sys/firmware/memmap. Containing below attribute in each file of that
directory:

attribute  num_pages  phys_addr  type  virt_addr
