ARM: mvebu: Add support to get the ID and the revision of a SoC

All the mvebu SoCs have information related to their variant and
revision that can be read from the PCI control register.

This patch adds support for Armada XP and Armada 370. This reading of
the revision and the ID are done before the PCI initialization to
avoid any conflicts. Once these data are retrieved, the resources are
freed to let the PCI subsystem use it.
