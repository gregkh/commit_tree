sh_eth: do not reset PHY needlessly

There's no need anymore to call phy_init_hw() to reset/resume the PHY from the
driver, as the call chain in phylib already has reached it, and so reset/resumed
the PHY (even resuming it twice). This duplicate reset is not only  needless, it
e.g. clears the PHY's interrupt enables just setup by phylib and so prevents the
expected IRQs from the PHY.
