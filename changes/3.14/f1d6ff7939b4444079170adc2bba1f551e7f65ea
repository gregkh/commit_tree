ASoC: tegra: update module reset list for Tegra124

Tegra124 adds a number of extra modules into the configlink bus, which
must be taken out of reset before the bus is used. Update the AHUB
driver to know about these extra modules (the AHUB HW module hosts the
configlink bus).

This patch depends on "ASoC: tegra: use reset framework" to compile,
which is ack'd and slated to go through a (large) topic branch in the
Tegra tree. So, we can either:

a) Merge that Tegra topic branch into the ASoC tree, then apply this.
   Note that I haven't created the topic branch yet, since I'm still
   waiting for DMA dependencies to be applied.

b) Apply this change to the Tegra tree too. This change isn't directly
   related to the changes in the Tegra tree; it just makes use of the new
   reset controller feature that's introduced there.
