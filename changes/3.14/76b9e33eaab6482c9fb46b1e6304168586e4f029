staging: comedi: pcl816: remove DEBUG macro

This macro is only used to output some function tracing debug messages.
These messages are just added noise so remove the DEBUG macro as well
as the noise.

Also, remove pcl816_cmdtest_out() which was only called as part of the
DEBUG() in pcl816_ai_cmdtest().
