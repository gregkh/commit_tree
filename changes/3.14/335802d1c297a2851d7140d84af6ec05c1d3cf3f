net: eth: 8390: remove section warning in etherh.c

Commit c45f812f0280 ('8390 : Replace ei_debug with msg_enable/NETIF_MSG_*
feature') ended up moving the printout of version[] from something that
will be compiled out due to defines, to something that is now evaluated
at runtime.

That means that what always used to be an access to an __initdata string
from non-__init code started showing up as a section mismatch when it
didn't before.

All other 8390 versions skip __initdata on the version string, and
starting to annotate the whole chain of callers with __init seems like
more churn than it's worth on this driver, so remove it from etherh.c as well.
