drivers/rtc/rtc-rx8581.c: add SMBus-only adapters support

Add support for SMBus-only adapters (e.g.  i2c-piix4).  The driver has
implemented only support for I2C adapters which implement the
I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_I2C_BLOCK functionality before.

With this patch it is possible to load and use the RTC driver with I2C and
SMBUS adapters like the rtc-ds1307 does.

Tested on AMD G Series Platform (i2c-piix4 adapter driver).
