iwlwifi: mvm: notify match found without filtering

Configure scheduled scan to notify match found on every beacon
or probe response if the scan request doesn't contain valid ssid
list for filtering.
Without this configuration the FW passes all beacons to the host
but doesn't notify the stack that the scan results are ready for
processing.
