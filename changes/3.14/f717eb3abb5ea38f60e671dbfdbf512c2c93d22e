slab: do not panic if we fail to create memcg cache

There is no point in flooding logs with warnings or especially crashing
the system if we fail to create a cache for a memcg.  In this case we
will be accounting the memcg allocation to the root cgroup until we
succeed to create its own cache, but it isn't that critical.
