s390/perf: Improve PMU selection for PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES events

The cpum_cf (counter facility) PMU does not support sampling events.
With cpum_sf (sampling facility), a PMU for sampling CPU cycles is
available.

Make cpum_sf the "default" PMU for PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES sampling
events but use the more precise cpum_cf PMU for non-sampling events.
