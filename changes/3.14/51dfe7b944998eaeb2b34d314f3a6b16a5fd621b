tg3: Do not include vlan acceleration features in vlan_features

Including hardware acceleration features in vlan_features breaks
stacked vlans (Q-in-Q) by marking the bottom vlan interface as
capable of acceleration.  This causes one of the tags to be lost
and the packets are sent with a sing vlan header.
