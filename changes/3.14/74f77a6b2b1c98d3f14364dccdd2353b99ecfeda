netfilter: introduce l2tp match extension

Introduce an xtables add-on for matching L2TP packets. Supports L2TPv2
and L2TPv3 over IPv4 and IPv6. As well as filtering on L2TP tunnel-id
and session-id, the filtering decision can also include the L2TP
packet type (control or data), protocol version (2 or 3) and
encapsulation type (UDP or IP).

The most common use for this will likely be to filter L2TP data
packets of individual L2TP tunnels or sessions. While a u32 match can
be used, the L2TP protocol headers are such that field offsets differ
depending on bits set in the header, making rules for matching generic
L2TP connections cumbersome. This match extension takes care of all
that.
