x86: Replace assembly access_ok() with a C variant

It turns out that the assembly variant doesn't actually produce that
good code, presumably partly because it creates a long dependency
chain with no scheduling, and partly because we cannot get a flags
result out of gcc (which could be fixed with asm goto, but it turns
out not to be worth it.)

The C code allows gcc to schedule and generate multiple (easily
predictable) branches, and as a side benefit we can really optimize
the case where the size is constant.
