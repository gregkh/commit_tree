sched/deadline: Test for CPU's presence explicitly

A hot-removed CPU may have ID that is numerically larger than the number of
existing CPUs in the system (e.g. we can unplug CPU 4 from a system that
has CPUs 0, 1 and 4).

Thus the WARN_ONs should check whether the CPU in question is currently
present, not whether its ID value is less than num_present_cpus().
