crypto: ccp - Change data length declarations to u64

When performing a hash operation if the amount of data buffered and a
request at or near the maximum data length is received then the length
calcuation could wrap causing an error in executing the hash operation.
Fix this by using a u64 type for the input and output data lengths in
all CCP operations.
