apm-emulation: add hibernation APM events to support suspend2disk

Some embedded systems use hibernation for fast boot. and in it,
some software components need to handle specific things before
hibernation and after restore. So it needs to capture the apm
status about these pm events.

Currently apm just supports suspend to ram, but not suspend to disk,
so here add logic about hibernation apm events.
