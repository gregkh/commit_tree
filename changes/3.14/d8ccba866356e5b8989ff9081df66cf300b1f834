drm/i915: grab a pages pin count for preallocate stolen

But only when we indeed set up a gtt mapping. We need this since the
vma also holds a pages_pin_count, on top of the unconditional
pages_pin_count we grab for all stolen objects (to avoid swap-out).

This should avoid a pages_pin_count underrun when cleaning up
framebuffers objects taken over from the BIOS.

Chris mentioned in his review that this bug even predates the vma
conversion.
