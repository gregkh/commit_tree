numa: add a sysctl for numa_balancing

Add a working sysctl to enable/disable automatic numa memory balancing
at runtime.

This allows us to track down performance problems with this feature and
is generally a good idea.

This was possible earlier through debugfs, but only with special
debugging options set.  Also fix the boot message.
