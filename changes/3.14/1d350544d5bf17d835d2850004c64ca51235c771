powerpc/eeh: Add restore_config operation

After reset on the specific PE or PHB, we never configure AER
correctly on PowerNV platform. We needn't care it on pSeries
platform. The patch introduces additional EEH operation eeh_ops::
restore_config() so that we have chance to configure AER correctly
for PowerNV platform.
