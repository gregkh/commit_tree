memblock: don't silently align size in memblock_virt_alloc()

In original __alloc_memory_core_early() for bootmem wrapper, we do not
align size silently.

We should not do that, as later free with old size will leave some range
not freed.

It's obvious that code is copied from memblock_base_nid(), and that code
is wrong for the same reason.

Also remove that in memblock_alloc_base.
