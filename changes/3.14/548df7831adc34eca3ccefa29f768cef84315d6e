[media] vb2: Check if there are buffers before streamon

This patch adds a test preventing streamon() if there is no buffer
ready.

Without this patch, a user could call streamon() before
preparing any buffer. This leads to a situation where if he calls
close() before calling streamoff() the device is kept streaming.
