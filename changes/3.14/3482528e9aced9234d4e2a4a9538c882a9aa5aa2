USB: core: remove CONFIG_USB_DEBUG usage

CONFIG_USB_DEBUG is going away, so remove the few places in the USB core
that relied on them.

This means that we always now do the "debug" checks for every urb
submitted, which is a good idea, as who knows how many driver bugs we
have been ignoring when people forget to enable this option.  Also, with
the overall speed of USB, doing these extra checks should not cause any
additional overhead.

Also, no longer announce all devices being added to the system if
CONFIG_USB_DEBUG is enabled, as it's not going to be around much longer.
