tcp: metrics: Handle v6/v4-mapped sockets in tcp-metrics

A socket may be v6/v4-mapped. In that case sk->sk_family is AF_INET6,
but the IP being used is actually an IPv4-address.
Current's tcp-metrics will thus represent it as an IPv6-address:

root@server:~# ip tcp_metrics
::ffff:10.1.1.2 age 22.920sec rtt 18750us rttvar 15000us cwnd 10
10.1.1.2 age 47.970sec rtt 16250us rttvar 10000us cwnd 10

This patch modifies the tcp-metrics so that they are able to handle the
v6/v4-mapped sockets correctly.
