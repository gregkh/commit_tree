s390: delete new instances of __cpuinit usage

The patch "s390/perf: add support for the CPU-Measurement Sampling
Facility" added a new instance of the __cpuinit macro usage.

We removed this a couple versions ago; we now want to remove
the compat no-op stubs.  Introducing new users is not what
we want to see at this point in time, as it will break once
the stubs are gone.
