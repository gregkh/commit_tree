powerpc/powernv: Call OPAL sync before kexec'ing

Its possible that OPAL may be writing to host memory during
kexec (like dump retrieve scenario). In this situation we might
end up corrupting host memory.

This patch makes OPAL sync call to make sure OPAL stops
writing to host memory before kexec'ing.
