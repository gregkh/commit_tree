audit: fix incorrect set of audit_sock

NETLINK_CB(skb).sk is the socket of user space process,
netlink_unicast in kauditd_send_skb wants the kernel
side socket. Since the sk_state of audit netlink socket
is not NETLINK_CONNECTED, so the netlink_getsockbyportid
doesn't return -ECONNREFUSED.

And the socket of userspace process can be released anytime,
so the audit_sock may point to invalid socket.

this patch sets the audit_sock to the kernel side audit
netlink socket.
