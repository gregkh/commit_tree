spi/davinci: Don't select EDMA

There is no need to force selection of TI EDMA DMA engine
driver when DaVinci SPI driver is selected. The driver
builds just fine even with CONFIG_TI_EDMA disabled.

Forcing this selection causes warnings of the sort:

warning: (ARCH_KEYSTONE && SPI_DAVINCI) selects TI_EDMA which has unmet direct dependencies (DMADEVICES && (ARCH_DAVINCI || ARCH_OMAP || ARCH_KEYSTONE))

This reverts commit b5f14330590118e6a0659255476c0f24ab681e05.
