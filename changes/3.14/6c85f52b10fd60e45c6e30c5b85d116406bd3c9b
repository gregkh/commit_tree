kvm/ppc: IRQ disabling cleanup

Simplify the handling of lazy EE by going directly from fully-enabled
to hard-disabled.  This replaces the lazy_irq_pending() check
(including its misplaced kvm_guest_exit() call).

As suggested by Tiejun Chen, move the interrupt disabling into
kvmppc_prepare_to_enter() rather than have each caller do it.  Also
move the IRQ enabling on heavyweight exit into
kvmppc_prepare_to_enter().
