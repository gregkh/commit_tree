ALSA: hda - Always do delayed probes for HD-audio devices

HD-audio devices tend to take long time for finishing the whole
probing procedure.  In this patch, the time-consuming part of the
probing procedure, the codec probe and the rest initializations, are
moved in the work, so that they can be done asynchronously in parallel
with probes of other devices.

Since we already have this mechanism in the driver code for the
firmware and i915 request_symbol() stuff, we just need to enable it
always; the resultant patch even reduces more lines, which is an
additional bonus.

Credit goes to David Henningsson, who suggested this workaround.
