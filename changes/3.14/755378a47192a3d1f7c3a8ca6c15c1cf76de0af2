sched/deadline: Add period support for SCHED_DEADLINE tasks

Make it possible to specify a period (different or equal than
deadline) for -deadline tasks. Relative deadlines (D_i) are used on
task arrivals to generate new scheduling (absolute) deadlines as "d =
t + D_i", and periods (P_i) to postpone the scheduling deadlines as "d
= d + P_i" when the budget is zero.

This is in general useful to model (and schedule) tasks that have slow
activation rates (long periods), but have to be scheduled soon once
activated (short deadlines).
