powerpc/eeh: Hotplug improvement

When EEH error comes to one specific PCI device before its driver
is loaded, we will apply hotplug to recover the error. During the
plug time, the PCI device will be probed and its driver is loaded.
Then we wrongly calls to the error handlers if the driver supports
EEH explicitly.

The patch intends to fix by introducing flag EEH_DEV_NO_HANDLER and
set it before we remove the PCI device. In turn, we can avoid wrongly
calls the error handlers of the PCI device after its driver loaded.
