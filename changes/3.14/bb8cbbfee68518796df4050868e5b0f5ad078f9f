tasks/fork: Remove unnecessary child->exit_state

A zombie task obviously can't fork(), remove the unnecessary
initialization of child->exit_state. It is zero anyway after
dup_task_struct().

Note: copy_process() is huge and it has a lot of chaotic
initializations, probably it makes sense to move them into the
new helper called by dup_task_struct().
