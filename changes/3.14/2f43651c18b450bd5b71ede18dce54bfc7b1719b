drivers: gpu: Mark function as static in radeon_object.c

Mark function radeon_bo_clear_va() as static in
drm/radeon/radeon_object.c because it is not used outside this file.

This eliminates the following warning in drm/radeon/radeon_object.c:
drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_object.c:49:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘radeon_bo_clear_va’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
