ARM: shmobile: Sync Lager DTS with Lager reference DTS

Copy the device nodes from Lager reference into the Lager device tree
file. This will allow us to use a single DTS file regarless of kernel
configuration. In case of legacy C board code the device nodes may or
may not be used, but in the multiplatform case all the DT device nodes
are used.
