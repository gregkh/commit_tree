ACPICA: Linuxize: Cleanup spaces after special macro invocations.

This patch reflects the improvment of a cleanup step which is performed in
the release process.

There are still spaces in the "linuxized" ACPICA files after special macro
invocations.  This is because indent treats comments and pre-processor
directives as spaces, thus we need to skip them.

Before applying this patch, cleanup code will search from keyword back to
end of line and wipe spaces between them.

After applying this patch, cleanup code will search to the end of the macro
invocations, skip "empty lines", "comments" and "pre-processor directives",
then wipe the spaces between the new line and the first non-spaces
characters.

Following improvements are thus achieved in the release automation by this
commit which are originally maintained manually:

Some empty lines are restored by this commit due to the change of the
removal implementation.
