[media] s5p-jpeg: Add initial device tree support for S5PV210/Exynos4210 SoCs

This patch enables the JPEG codec on S5PV210 and Exynos4210 SoCs. There are
some differences in newer versions of the JPEG codec IP on SoCs like Exynos4x12
and Exynos5 series and support for them will be added in subsequent patches.
