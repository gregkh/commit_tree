kernfs: remove KERNFS_ACTIVE_REF and add kernfs_lockdep()

There currently are two mechanisms gating active ref lockdep
annotations - KERNFS_LOCKDEP flag and KERNFS_ACTIVE_REF type mask.
The former disables lockdep annotations in kernfs_get/put_active()
while the latter disables all of kernfs_deactivate().

While KERNFS_ACTIVE_REF also behaves as an optimization to skip the
deactivation step for non-file nodes, the benefit is marginal and it
needlessly diverges code paths.  Let's drop KERNFS_ACTIVE_REF and use
KERNFS_LOCKDEP in kernfs_deactivate() too.

While at it, add a test helper kernfs_lockdep() to test KERNFS_LOCKDEP
flag so that it's more convenient and the related code can be compiled
out when not enabled.
