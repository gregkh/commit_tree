Documentation/memory-barriers.txt: Add needed ACCESS_ONCE() calls to memory-barriers.txt

The Documentation/memory-barriers.txt file was written before
the need for ACCESS_ONCE() was fully appreciated.  It therefore
contains no ACCESS_ONCE() calls, which can be a problem when
people lift examples from it.  This commit therefore adds
ACCESS_ONCE() calls.
