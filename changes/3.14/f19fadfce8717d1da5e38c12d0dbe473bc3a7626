net: mvneta: implement rx_copybreak

calling dma_map_single()/dma_unmap_single() is quite expensive compared
to copying a small packet. So let's copy short frames and keep the buffers
mapped. We set the limit to 256 bytes which seems to give good results both
on the XP-GP board and on the AX3/4.

The Rx small packet rate increased by 16.4% doing this, from 486kpps to
573kpps. It is worth noting that even the call to the function
dma_sync_single_range_for_cpu() is expensive (300 ns) although less
than dma_unmap_single(). Without it, the packet rate raises to 711kpps
(+24% more). Thus on systems where coherency from device to CPU is
guaranteed by a snoop control unit, this patch should provide even more
gains, and probably rx_copybreak could be increased.
