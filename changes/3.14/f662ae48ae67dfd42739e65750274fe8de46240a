mmc: fix host release issue after discard operation

Under function mmc_blk_issue_rq, after an MMC discard operation,
the MMC request data structure may be freed in memory. Later in
the same function, the check of req->cmd_flags & MMC_REQ_SPECIAL_MASK
is dangerous and invalid. It causes the MMC host not to be released
when it should.

This patch fixes the issue by marking the special request down before
the discard/flush operation.
