Thermal: Allow first update of cooling device state

In initialization, if the cooling device is initialized at
max cooling state, and the thermal zone temperature is below
the first trip point, then the cooling state can't be updated
to the right state, untill the first trip point be triggered.

To fix this issue, allow first update of cooling device state
during registration, initialized "updated" device field as
"false" (instead of "true").
