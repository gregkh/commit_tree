nfs: always make sure page is up-to-date before extending a write to cover the entire page

We should always make sure the cached page is up-to-date when we're
determining whether we can extend a write to cover the full page -- even
if we've received a write delegation from the server.

Commit c7559663 added logic to skip this check if we have a write
delegation, which can lead to data corruption such as the following
scenario if client B receives a write delegation from the NFS server:

Client A:
    # echo 123456789 > /mnt/file

Client B:
    # echo abcdefghi >> /mnt/file
    # cat /mnt/file
    0�D0�abcdefghi

Just because we hold a write delegation doesn't mean that we've read in
the entire page contents.
