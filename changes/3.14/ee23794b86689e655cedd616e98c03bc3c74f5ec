video: vgacon: Don't build on arm64

arm64 is unlikely to have a VGA console and does not export screen_info
causing build failures if the driver is build, for example in all*config.
Add a dependency on !ARM64 to prevent this.

This list is getting quite long, it may be easier to depend on a symbol
which architectures that do support the driver can select.
