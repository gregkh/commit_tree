powerpc: Add support for the optimised lockref implementation

This commit adds the architecture support required to enable the
optimised implementation of lockrefs.

That's as simple as defining arch_spin_value_unlocked() and selecting
the Kconfig option.

We also define cmpxchg64_relaxed(), because the lockref code does not
need the cmpxchg to have barrier semantics.

Using Linus' test case[1] on one system I see a 4x improvement for the
basic enablement, and a further 1.3x for cmpxchg64_relaxed(), for a
total of 5.3x vs the baseline.

On another system I see more like 2x improvement.
