Staging: vt6656: Reduce line length of bssdb.c

Long lines are split into multiple ones to reduce the line length.
Additionally some alignment fixes are made that previous patches
missed.

Unfortunately, due to the high indentation levels present in parts of
bssdb.c, this patch leaves some lines which are longer than 80
characters.
