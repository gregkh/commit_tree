eql: use __dev_get_by_name instead of dev_get_by_name to find interface

The following call chain indicates that eql_ioctl(), eql_enslave(),
eql_emancipate(), eql_g_slave_cfg() and eql_s_slave_cfg() are
protected under rtnl_lock. So if we use __dev_get_by_name() instead
of dev_get_by_name() to find interface handlers in them, this would
help us avoid to change interface reference counters.

dev_ioctl()
  rtnl_lock()
    dev_ifsioc()
      eql_ioctl()
        eql_enslave()
	eql_emancipate()
	eql_g_slave_cfg()
	eql_s_slave_cfg()
  rtnl_unlock()

Additionally we also change their return values from -EINVAL to
-ENODEV in case that interfaces are no found.
