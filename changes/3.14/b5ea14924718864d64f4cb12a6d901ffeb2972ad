imx-drm: imx-drm-core: use the crtc drm device for vblank

There are a couple of ways to get at the drm_device for the vblank
operations.  One of them is via the private imxdrm structure, the
other is via the DRM crtc structure, which also stores a pointer.
Use the DRM method instead of our own method.
