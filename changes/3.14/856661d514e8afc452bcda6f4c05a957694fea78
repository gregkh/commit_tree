gpu: ion: Add support for cached mappings that don't fault

We have found that faulting in the mappings for cached
allocations has a significant performance impact and is
only a benefit if only a small part of the buffer is
touched by the cpu (an uncommon case for software rendering).
This patch introduces a ION_FLAG_CACHED_NEEDS_SYNC
which determines whether a mapping should be created by
faulting or at mmap time.  If this flag is set,
userspace must manage the caches explictly using the SYNC ioctl.
