libceph: follow redirect replies from osds

Follow redirect replies from osds, for details see ceph.git commit
fbbe3ad1220799b7bb00ea30fce581c5eadaf034.

v1 (current) version of redirect reply consists of oloc and oid, which
expands to pool, key, nspace, hash and oid.  However, server-side code
that would populate anything other than pool doesn't exist yet, and
hence this commit adds support for pool redirects only.  To make sure
that future server-side updates don't break us, we decode all fields
and, if any of key, nspace, hash or oid have a non-default value, error
out with "corrupt osd_op_reply ..." message.
