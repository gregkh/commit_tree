Staging rtl8192e: Correcting wrong usage of macro in r8192E_phy.c and removing corresponding warning in rtllib_debug.h

We fixed in rtllib_debug.h the following checkpatch warning:
	WARNING: do {} while (0) macros should not be semicolon terminated.

After deleting this semicolon we also had to fix the wrong use of this macro in rtl8192e/r8192E_phy.c
