Staging: TIDSPBRIDGE: Fix mmap to map the correct region of physical memory

Commit 559c71fe5dc3 ("Staging: TIDSPBRIDGE: Use vm_iomap_memory for
mmap-ing instead of remap_pfn_range") had the effect of inadvertently
shifting the start of the physical memory area mapped by
pdata->phys_mempool_base.  Correct this by subtracting that shift before
calling vm_iomap_memory() and adding it back afterwards.
