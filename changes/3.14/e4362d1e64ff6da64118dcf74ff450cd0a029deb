MIPS: Fix possible build error with transparent hugepages enabled

If CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is enabled, but CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE is not,
it is possible to end up with a configuration that fails to build with the
following error:

include/linux/huge_mm.h:125:2: error: #error "hugepages can't be allocated by the buddy allocator"

This is due to CONFIG_FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER defaulting to 11. It already has
ranges that change the valid values when HUGETLB_PAGE is enabled, but this
is not done for TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE. Fix by changing the HUGETLB_PAGE
dependencies to MIPS_HUGE_TLB_SUPPORT, which includes both
TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE and HUGETLB_PAGE.
