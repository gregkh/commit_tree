checkpatch: attempt to find missing switch/case break;

switch case statements missing a break statement are an unfortunately
common error.

e.g.:
  commit 4a2c94c9b6c0 ("HID: kye: Add report fixup for Genius Manticore Keyboard")

case blocks should end in a break/return/goto/continue.

If a fall-through is used, it should have a comment showing that it is
intentional.  Ideally that comment should be something like:
"/* fall-through */"

Add a test to look for missing break statements.

This looks only at the context lines before an inserted case so it's
possible to have false positives when the context contains a close brace
and the break is before the brace and not part of the patch context.

Looking at recent patches, this is a pretty rare occurrence.  The normal
kernel style uses a break as the last line of the previous block.
