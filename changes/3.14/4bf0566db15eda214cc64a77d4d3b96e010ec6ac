tracing: Remove double-underscore naming in syscall trigger invocations

There's no reason to use double-underscores for any variable name in
ftrace_syscall_enter()/exit(), since those functions aren't generated
and there's no need to avoid namespace collisions as with the event
macros, which is where the original invocation code came from.
