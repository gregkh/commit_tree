dm delay: use per-bio data instead of a mempool and slab cache

Starting with commit c0820cf5ad095 ("dm: introduce per_bio_data"),
device mapper has the capability to pre-allocate a target-specific
structure with the bio.

This patch changes dm-delay to use this facility instead of a slab cache
and mempool.
