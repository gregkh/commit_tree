libata: add ATA_HORKAGE_BROKEN_FPDMA_AA quirk for Seagate Momentus SpinPoint M8 (2BA30001)

Via commit 87809942d3fa "libata: add ATA_HORKAGE_BROKEN_FPDMA_AA quirk
for Seagate Momentus SpinPoint M8" we added a quirk for disks named
"ST1000LM024 HN-M101MBB" with firmware revision "2AR10001".

As reported on https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1073901,
we need to also add firmware revision 2BA30001 as it is broken as well.
