x86, cpu, amd: Add workaround for family 16h, erratum 793

This adds the workaround for erratum 793 as a precaution in case not
every BIOS implements it.  This addresses CVE-2013-6885.

Erratum text:

[Revision Guide for AMD Family 16h Models 00h-0Fh Processors,
document 51810 Rev. 3.04 November 2013]

793 Specific Combination of Writes to Write Combined Memory Types and
Locked Instructions May Cause Core Hang

Description

Under a highly specific and detailed set of internal timing
conditions, a locked instruction may trigger a timing sequence whereby
the write to a write combined memory type is not flushed, causing the
locked instruction to stall indefinitely.

Potential Effect on System

Processor core hang.

Suggested Workaround

BIOS should set MSR
C001_1020[15] = 1b.

Fix Planned

No fix planned

[ hpa: updated description, fixed typo in MSR name ]
