i7core_edac: Fix PCI device reference count

The reference count changes done by pci_get_device can be a little
misleading when the usage diverges from the most common scheme. The
reference count of the device passed as the last parameter is always
decreased, even if the function returns no new device. So if we are
going to try alternative device IDs, we must manually increment the
device reference count before each retry. If we don't, we end up
decreasing the reference count, and after a few modprobe/rmmod cycles
the PCI devices will vanish.

In other words and as Alan put it: without this fix the EDAC code
corrupts the PCI device list.
