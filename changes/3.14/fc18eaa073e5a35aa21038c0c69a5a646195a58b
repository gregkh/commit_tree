i40e: refactor VF reset flow

Fix the VF reset flow so that it works on real hardware. After
discussions with the HW team, the reset flow has been changed
somewhat.

- Change the i40e_reset_vf function to a void type, and fix
  up the callers to reflect this.
- Move the MSI-X disable code to i40e_free_vf_res since it must
  be done every time the VF is freed, regardless of whether or
  not it is reset.
- Ensure that the PCIe bus is quiet before polling the reset bit.
- Don't clear the VFGEN_RSTAT1 register at the beginning as it is
  cleared by the reset.
- Poll longer for the reset to be done.
- Disable the queues using an existing function rather than
  rolling our own.
- Free and reallocate the VSI after reset to avoid rx hang.
