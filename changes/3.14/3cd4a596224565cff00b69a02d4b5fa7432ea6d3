CLK: TI: add support for clockdomain binding

Some OMAP clocks require knowledge about their parent clockdomain for
book keeping purposes. This patch creates a new DT binding for TI
clockdomains, which act as a collection of device clocks. Clockdomain
itself is rather misleading name for the hardware functionality, as at
least on OMAP4 / OMAP5 / DRA7 the clockdomains can be collections of either
clocks and/or IP blocks, thus idle-domain or such might be more appropriate.
For most cases on these SoCs, the kernel doesn't even need the information
and the mappings can be ignored.
