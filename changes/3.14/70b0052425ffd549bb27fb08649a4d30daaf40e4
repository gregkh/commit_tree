Input: da9052_onkey - use correct register bit for key status

The wrong register bit of the DA9052/3 PMIC registers was
used to determine the status on the ONKEY.

Also a failure in reading the status register will no longer
result in the work queue being rescheduled as that would result
in a (potentially) endless retry.
