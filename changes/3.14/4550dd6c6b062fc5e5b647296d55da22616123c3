block: Immutable bio vecs

This adds a mechanism by which we can advance a bio by an arbitrary
number of bytes without modifying the biovec: bio->bi_iter.bi_bvec_done
indicates the number of bytes completed in the current bvec.

Various driver code still needs to be updated to not refer to the bvec
directly before we can use this for interesting things, like efficient
bio splitting.
