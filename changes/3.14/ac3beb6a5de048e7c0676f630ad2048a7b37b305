GFS2: Don't use ENOBUFS when ENOMEM is the correct error code

Al Viro has tactfully pointed out that we are using the incorrect
error code in some cases. This patch fixes that, and also removes
the (unused) return value for glock dumping.

>        * gfs2_iget() - ENOBUFS instead of ENOMEM.  ENOBUFS is
> "No buffer space available (POSIX.1 (XSI STREAMS option))" and since
> we don't support STREAMS it's probably fair game, but... what the hell?
