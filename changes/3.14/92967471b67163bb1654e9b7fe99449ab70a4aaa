zram: introduce zram->tb_lock

Currently, the zram table is protected by zram->lock but it's rather
coarse-grained lock and it makes hard for scalibility.

Let's use own rwlock instead of depending on zram->lock.  This patch
adds new locking so obviously, it would make slow but this patch is just
prepartion for removing coarse-grained rw_semaphore(ie, zram->lock)
which is hurdle about zram scalability.

Final patch in this patchset series will remove the lock from read-path
and change rw_semaphore with mutex in write path.  With bonus, we could
drop pending slot free mess in next patch.
