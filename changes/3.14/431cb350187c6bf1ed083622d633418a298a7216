[media] az6007: support Technisat Cablestar Combo HDCI (minus remote)

This is similar to the Terratec H7. It works with the same az6007 firmware as
the former, however the drx-k firmware of the H7 will NOT work. Hence use
a different firmware name. The firmware does not need to exist as the one in
the eeprom is just fine as long as the h7 one doesn't get loaded, but maybe
some day someone wants to load it (the one from the h5 would work too).
Also since the config entry is now different anyway disable support for rc.
AFAIK the Technisat remote (TS35) is RC5 and the code (which a code comment
claims doesn't work anyway) only would handle NEC hence it's pointless creating
a device and polling it if we already know it can't work.
CI is untested.

Originally based on idea found on
http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/TechniSat_CableStar_Combo_HD_CI claiming
only id needs to be added (but failed to mention it only worked because the
driver couldn't find the h7 drx-k firmware...).
