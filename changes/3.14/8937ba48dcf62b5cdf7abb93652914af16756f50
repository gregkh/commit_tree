powerpc/mm: Only check for _PAGE_PRESENT in set_pte/pmd functions

We want to make sure we don't use these function when updating a pte
or pmd entry that have a valid hpte entry, because these functions
don't invalidate them. So limit the check to _PAGE_PRESENT bit.
Numafault core changes use these functions for updating _PAGE_NUMA bits.
That should be ok because when _PAGE_NUMA is set we can be sure that
hpte entries are not present.
