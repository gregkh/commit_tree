ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Configure xxTDM, xxFMT and xxFMCT registers synchronously

These registers can be configured synchronously for playback and capture.
Furthermore when McASP is in master and sync mode the capture operation
needs the TX path to be configured in order to be able to provide the needed
clocks for the bus.
xxFMT and xxFMCT registers has been already configured for both TX and RX
other places in the driver.
