microblaze: Fix missing HZ macro

Add missing param.h header because of HZ macro.
It is causing compilation failure:
In file included from include/linux/delay.h:14:0,
                    from drivers/clk/qcom/reset.c:18:
drivers/clk/qcom/reset.c: In function 'qcom_reset':
arch/microblaze/include/asm/delay.h:39:35: error: 'HZ'
 undeclared (first use in this function)
