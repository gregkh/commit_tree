perf symbols: Use consistent name for the DSO binary type member

It was called "data_type", but in this context "data" is way too vague,
it could mean the "data" ELF segment, or something else.

Since we have dso__read_binary_type_filename() and the values this field
receives are all DSO__BINARY_TYPE_<FOO> we may as well call it
"binary_type" for consistency sake.

It also seems more appropriate since it determines if we can do
operations like annotation and DWARF unwinding, that needs more than
just the symtab, requiring access to ELF text segments, CFI ELF
sections, etc.
