gpio / ACPI: get rid of acpi_gpio.h

Now that all users of acpi_gpio.h have been moved to use either the GPIO
descriptor interface or to the internal gpiolib.h we can get rid of
acpi_gpio.h entirely.

Once this is done the only interface to get GPIOs to drivers enumerated
from ACPI namespace is the descriptor based interface.
