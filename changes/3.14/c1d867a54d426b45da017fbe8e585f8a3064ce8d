fs/proc/proc_devtree.c: remove empty /proc/device-tree when no openfirmware exists.

Distribution kernels might want to build in support for /proc/device-tree
for kernels that might end up running on hardware that doesn't support
openfirmware.  This results in an empty /proc/device-tree existing.
Remove it if the OFW root node doesn't exist.

This situation actually confuses grub2, resulting in install failures.
grub2 sees the /proc/device-tree and picks the wrong install target cf.

grub should be more robust, but still, leaving an empty proc dir seems
pointless.
