autofs4: translate pids to the right namespace for the daemon

The PID and the TGID of the process triggering the mount are sent to the
daemon.  Currently the global pid values are sent (ones valid in the
initial pid namespace) but this is wrong if the autofs daemon itself is
not running in the initial pid namespace.

So send the pid values that are valid in the namespace of the autofs
daemon.

The namespace to use is taken from the oz_pgrp pid pointer, which was
set at mount time to the mounting process' pid namespace.

If the pid translation fails (the triggering process is in an unrelated
pid namespace) then the automount fails with ENOENT.
