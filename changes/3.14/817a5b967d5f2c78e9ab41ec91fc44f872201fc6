ARM: ux500: move MCDE pin config to device tree

This moves the MCDE pin control table out of the board file
and into the device tree. Some pins and configs have been
marked as used by sub-devices or slaves to the MCDE, such
as I2C device 0-070 which is the HDMI interface circuit
AV8100, but the pins rather belong to the MCDE SOC block
as they come out of the main ASIC. The touch screen GPIO
is not related to MCDE so this gets deleted and need to
be tied to the respective touch screen (I2C) device
once that device is added instead.
