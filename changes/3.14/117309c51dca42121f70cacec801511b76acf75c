HID: microsoft: Add ID's for Surface Type/Touch Cover 2

The Microsoft Surface Type/Touch cover 2 devices have the flag HID_DG_CONTACTID
in their reports.This causes the device to bind to the hid-multitouch driver,
which doesn't handle generic keyboard/mouse input events.  The patch adds
the hardware id's of the device to hid-microsoft and to the HID special
driver array, which makes the device get handled by hid-generic/hid-input
properly.
