xfs: free the list of recovery items on error

Recovery builds a list of items on the transaction's
r_itemq head. Normally these items are committed and freed.
But in the event of a recovery error, these allocations
are leaked.

If the error occurs during item reordering, then reconstruct
the r_itemq list before deleting the list to avoid leaking
the entries that were on one of the temporary lists.
