Btrfs: faster file extent item search in clone ioctl

When we are looking for file extent items that intersect the cloning
range, for each one that falls completely outside the range, don't
release the path and do another full tree search - just move on
to the next slot and copy the file extent item into our buffer only
if the item intersects the cloning range.
