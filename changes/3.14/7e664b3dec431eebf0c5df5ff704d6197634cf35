dm space map metadata: fix extending the space map

When extending a metadata space map we should do the first commit whilst
still in bootstrap mode -- a mode where all blocks get allocated in the
new area.

That way the commit overhead is allocated from the newly added space.
Otherwise we risk running out of space.

With this fix, and the previous commit "dm space map common: make sure
new space is used during extend", the following device mapper testsuite
test passes:
 dmtest run --suite thin-provisioning -n /resize_metadata_no_io/
