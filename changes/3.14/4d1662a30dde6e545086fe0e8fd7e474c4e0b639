dm thin: avoid metadata commit if a pool's thin devices haven't changed

Commit 905e51b ("dm thin: commit outstanding data every second")
introduced a periodic commit.  This commit occurs regardless of whether
any thin devices have made changes.

Fix the periodic commit to check if any of a pool's thin devices have
changed using dm_pool_changed_this_transaction().
