ASoC: fsl-ssi: Fix interrupt stats for imx

irqs should only be requested/released with enabled DMA. Previously
interrupt statistics where disabled for IMX Processors because of
different writeable SISR bits.

This patch introduces support for irqstats on imx processors again by
creating a sisr writeback mask and introducing a imx35-ssi compatible.
