tty: Enable configurable tty flip buffer limit

Allow driver to configure its maximum flip buffer memory
consumption/limit. This is necessary for very-high speed line
rates (in excess of 10MB/sec) because the flip buffers can
be saturated before the line discipline has a chance to
throttle the input.
