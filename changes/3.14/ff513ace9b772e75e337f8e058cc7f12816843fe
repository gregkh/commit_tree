libceph: take map_sem for read in handle_reply()

Handling redirect replies requires both map_sem and request_mutex.
Taking map_sem unconditionally near the top of handle_reply() avoids
possible race conditions that arise from releasing request_mutex to be
able to acquire map_sem in redirect reply case.  (Lock ordering is:
map_sem, request_mutex, crush_mutex.)
