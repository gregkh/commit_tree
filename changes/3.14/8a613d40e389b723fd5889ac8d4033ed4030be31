perf probe: Expand given path to absolute path

Expand given path to absolute path in the option parser, except for a
module name.

Since realpath at later stage in processing several probe point, can be
called several times (even if currently doesn't, it can happen when we
expands the feature), it is waste of the performance.

Processing it once at the early stage can avoid that.

Changes from previous one:
 - Fix not to print null string.
 - Allocate memory for given path/module name everytime.
