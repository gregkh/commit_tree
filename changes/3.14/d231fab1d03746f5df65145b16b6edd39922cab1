ARM: multi_v7: copy most options from tegra_defconfig

multi_v7_defconfig was missing a large number of options that were in
tegra_defconfig. This patch adds them. The changes fall into the
following categories:

* Enable more Tegra SoC options/drivers.
* Enable more drivers for Tegra boards.
* Enable more options that are useful for running distros.

The patch removes a few lines as well, simply because those options are
now selected by something else, and "make savedefconfig" removes them. I
verified that the options appear in .config after
"make multi_v7_defconfig".
