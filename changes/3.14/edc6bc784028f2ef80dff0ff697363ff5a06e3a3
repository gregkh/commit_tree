x86/intel/mid: Fix X86_INTEL_MID dependencies

This patch fixes the following warning:

  warning: (X86_INTEL_MID) selects INTEL_SCU_IPC which has unmet direct dependencies (X86 && X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES && X86_INTEL_MID)

It happens because when selected, X86_INTEL_MID tries to select
INTEL_SCU_IPC regardless all its dependencies are met or not.

This patch fixes it by adding the missing X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES
dependency to X86_INTEL_MID.
