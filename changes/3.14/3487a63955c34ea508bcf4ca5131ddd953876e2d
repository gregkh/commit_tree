drivers: mtd: m25p80: add quad read support

Some flash also support quad read mode. Adding support for quad read
mode in m25p80 for Spansion and Macronix flash.

[Tweaked by Brian]

With this patch, quad-read support will override fast-read and
normal-read, if the SPI controller and flash chip both support it.
