clk: add accuracy support for fixed clock

This patch adds support for accuracy retrieval on fixed clocks.
It also adds a new dt property called 'clock-accuracy' to define the clock
accuracy.

This can be usefull for oscillator (RC, crystal, ...) definitions which are
always given an accuracy characteristic.
