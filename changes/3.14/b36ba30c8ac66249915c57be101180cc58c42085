clk: qcom: Add reset controller support

Reset controllers and clock controllers are combined into one IP
block on Qualcomm chipsets. Usually a reset signal is associated
with each clock branch but sometimes a reset signal is associated
with a handful of clocks. Either way the register interface is
the same; set a bit to assert a reset and clear a bit to deassert
a reset. Add support for these types of resets signals.
