timekeeping: Fix missing timekeeping_update in suspend path

Since 48cdc135d4840 (Implement a shadow timekeeper), we have to
call timekeeping_update() after any adjustment to the timekeeping
structure in order to make sure that any adjustments to the structure
persist.

In the timekeeping suspend path, we udpate the timekeeper
structure, so we should be sure to update the shadow-timekeeper
before releasing the timekeeping locks. Currently this isn't done.

In most cases, the next time related code to run would be
timekeeping_resume, which does update the shadow-timekeeper, but
in an abundence of caution, this patch adds the call to
timekeeping_update() in the suspend path.
