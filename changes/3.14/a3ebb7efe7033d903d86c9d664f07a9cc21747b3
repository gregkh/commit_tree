bridge: Fix the way to find old local fdb entries in br_fdb_change_mac_address

We have been always failed to delete the old entry at
br_fdb_change_mac_address() because br_set_mac_address() updates
dev->dev_addr before calling br_fdb_change_mac_address() and
br_fdb_change_mac_address() uses dev->dev_addr to find the old entry.

That update of dev_addr is completely unnecessary because the same work
is done in br_stp_change_bridge_id() which is called right away after
calling br_fdb_change_mac_address().
