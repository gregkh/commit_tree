ARM: 7953/1: mm: ensure TLB invalidation is complete before enabling MMU

During __v{6,7}_setup, we invalidate the TLBs since we are about to
enable the MMU on return to head.S. Unfortunately, without a subsequent
dsb instruction, the invalidation is not guaranteed to have completed by
the time we write to the sctlr, potentially exposing us to junk/stale
translations cached in the TLB.

This patch reworks the init functions so that the dsb used to ensure
completion of cache/predictor maintenance is also used to ensure
completion of the TLB invalidation.
