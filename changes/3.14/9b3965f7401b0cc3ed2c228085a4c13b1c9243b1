x86, boot: Use __attribute__((used)) to ensure videocard structs are emitted

It looks like GCC will always emit an object that is marked with an
explicit section, although the documentation doesn't say that and we
possibly shouldn't be relying on it.

Clang does *not* do so, so add __attribute__((used)) to make sure.
