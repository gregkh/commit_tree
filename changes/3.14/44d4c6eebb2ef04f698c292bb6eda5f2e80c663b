drm/i915: Compute dsi_clk from pixel clock

Pixel clock based calculation is recommended in the MIPI host controller
documentation

v2: Based on review comments from Jani and Ville
    - Use dsi_clk in KHz rather than converting in Hz and back to MHz
    - RR formula is retained though not used but return dsi_clk in KHz now
    - Moved the m-n-p changes into a separate patch
    - Removed the parameter check for intel_dsi->dsi_clock_freq. This will be
      bought back in if needed when appropriate panel drivers are done

v3: Removed the unused mnp calculation from static table
