tty: Set correct tty name in 'active' sysfs attribute

The 'active' sysfs attribute should refer to the currently active tty
devices the console is running on, not the currently active console.

The console structure doesn't refer to any device in sysfs, only the tty
the console is running on has.  So we need to print out the tty names in
'active', not the console names.

This resolves an issue on s390 platforms in determining the correct
console device to use.
