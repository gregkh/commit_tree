usb: wusbcore: use USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT and USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT

Use USB_CTRL_SET_TIMEOUT and USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT for USB control
messages instead of an arbitrary 1s timeout value.  This is particularly
useful for WUSB since in the worst case RF scanario, a WUSB device can
be unresponsive for up to 4s and still be connected.
