perf: Add active_entry list head to struct perf_event

This patch adds a new field to the struct perf_event.
It is intended to be used to chain events which are
active (enabled). It helps in the hardware layer
for PMUs which do not have actual counter restrictions, i.e.,
free running read-only counters. Active events are chained
as opposed to being tracked via the counter they use.

To save space we use a union with hlist_entry as both
are mutually exclusive (suggested by Jiri Olsa).
