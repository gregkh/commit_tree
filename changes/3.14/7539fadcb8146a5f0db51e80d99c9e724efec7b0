net: Add utility functions to clear rxhash

In several places 'skb->rxhash = 0' is being done to clear the
rxhash value in an skb.  This does not clear l4_rxhash which could
still be set so that the rxhash wouldn't be recalculated on subsequent
call to skb_get_rxhash.  This patch adds an explict function to clear
all the rxhash related information in the skb properly.

skb_clear_hash_if_not_l4 clears the rxhash only if it is not marked as
l4_rxhash.

Fixed up places where 'skb->rxhash = 0' was being called.
