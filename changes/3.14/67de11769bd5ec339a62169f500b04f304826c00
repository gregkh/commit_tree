Btrfs: introduce the delayed inode ref deletion for the single link inode

The inode reference item is close to inode item, so we insert it simultaneously
with the inode item insertion when we create a file/directory.. In fact, we also
can handle the inode reference deletion by the same way. So we made this patch to
introduce the delayed inode reference deletion for the single link inode(At most
case, the file doesn't has hard link, so we don't take the hard link into account).

This function is based on the delayed inode mechanism. After applying this patch,
we can reduce the time of the file/directory deletion by ~10%.
