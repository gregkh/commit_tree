drm/i915: add always-on power wells instead of special casing them

Instead of using a separate function to check whether a power domain is
is always on, add an always-on power well covering all these power
domains and do the usual get/put on these unconditionally. Since we
don't assign a .set handler for these the get/put won't have any effect
besides the adjusted refcount.

This makes the code more readable and provides debug info also on the
use of always-on power wells (once the relevant debugfs entry is added.)

v3: make is_always_on to be bool instead of a bit field (Paulo)
