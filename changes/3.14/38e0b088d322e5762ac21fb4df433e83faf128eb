ARM: 7992/1: boot: compressed: ignore bswapsdi2.S

Commit 017f161a55b4 (ARM: 7877/1: use built-in byte swap function) added
bswapsdi2.{o,S} to arch/arm/boot/compressed/Makefile, but didn't update
the .gitignore. Thus after a a build git status shows bswapsdi2.S as a
new file, which is a little annoying.

This patch updates arch/arm/boot/compressed/.gitignore to ignore
bswapsdi2.S, as we already do for ashldi3.S and others.
