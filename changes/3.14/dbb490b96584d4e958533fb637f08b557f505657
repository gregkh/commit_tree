net: socket: error on a negative msg_namelen

When copying in a struct msghdr from the user, if the user has set the
msg_namelen parameter to a negative value it gets clamped to a valid
size due to a comparison between signed and unsigned values.

Ensure the syscall errors when the user passes in a negative value.
