drm/vmwgfx: Reemit context bindings when necessary v2

When a context is first referenced in the command stream, make sure that all
scrubbed (as a result of eviction) bindings are re-emitted. Also make sure that
all bound resources are put on the resource validate list.

This is needed for legacy emulation, since legacy user-space drivers will
typically not re-emit shader bindings. It also removes the requirement for
user-space drivers to re-emit render-target- and texture bindings.

Makes suspend and hibernate now also work with legacy user-space drivers on
guest-backed devices.

v2: Don't rebind on legacy devices.
