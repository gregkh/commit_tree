misc: Reserve minor for VFIO

VFIO currently allocates it's own dynamic chardev range, reserving the
first minor for the control part of the interface (/dev/vfio/vfio) and
the remainder for VFIO groups (/dev/vfio/$GROUP).  This works, but it
doesn't support auto loading.  For instance when libvirt checks for
VFIO support it looks for /dev/vfio/vfio, which currently doesn't
exist unless the vfio module is loaded.  By converting the control
device to a misc driver and reserving a static minor, we can enable
auto loading.

Reserving the minor is a prerequist to that conversion.  Minor 196
is unused by anything currently in the kernel.
