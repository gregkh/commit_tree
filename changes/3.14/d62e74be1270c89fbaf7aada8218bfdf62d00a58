ocfs2: fix issue that ocfs2_setattr() does not deal with new_i_size==i_size

The issue scenario is as following:

- Create a small file and fallocate a large disk space for a file with
  FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE option.

- ftruncate the file back to the original size again.  but the disk free
  space is not changed back.  This is a real bug that be fixed in this
  patch.

In order to solve the issue above, we modified ocfs2_setattr(), if
attr->ia_size != i_size_read(inode), It calls ocfs2_truncate_file(), and
truncate disk space to attr->ia_size.
