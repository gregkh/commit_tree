Input: mousedev - fix race when creating mixed device

We should not be using static variable mousedev_mix in methods that can be
called before that singleton gets assigned. While at it let's add open and
close methods to mousedev structure so that we do not need to test if we
are dealing with multiplexor or normal device and simply call appropriate
method directly.
