powerpc: enable the relocatable support for the fsl booke 32bit kernel

This is based on the codes in the head_44x.S. The difference is that
the init tlb size we used is 64M. With this patch we can only load the
kernel at address between memstart_addr ~ memstart_addr + 64M. We will
fix this restriction in the following patches.
