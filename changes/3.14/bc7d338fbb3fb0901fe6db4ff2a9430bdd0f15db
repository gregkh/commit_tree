i40e: reinit flow for the main VSI

This patch is the first in a 3 series patchset to implement
dynamically changing the queue count for the main VSI.

This patch starts by adding a reinit flow. This flow is designed
to be able to change just the queue count and not the number of
interrupt vectors that the device originally came up with.
