ARM: davinci: clock: return 0 upon error from clk_round_rate()

clk_round_rate() should return 0 now upon an error, rather than returning
a negative error code.  This is because clk_round_rate() is being changed
to return an unsigned return type rather than a signed type, since some
clock sources can generate rates higher than (2^31)-1 Hz.
