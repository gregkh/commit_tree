lockdep: Simplify a bit hardirq <-> softirq transitions

Instead of saving the hardirq state on a per CPU variable, which require
an explicit call before the softirq handling and some complication,
just save and restore the hardirq tracing state through functions
return values and parameters.

It simplifies a bit the black magic that works around the fact that
softirqs can be called from hardirqs while hardirqs can nest on softirqs
but those two cases have very different semantics and only the latter
case assume both states.
