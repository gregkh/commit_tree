ASoC: codec: tlv320aic32x4: Fix regmap range config

This codec driver fails to probe because it has a higher regmap
range_max value than max_register. This patch sets the range_max to the
max_register value as described in the for struct regmap_range_cfg:
"@range_max: Address of the highest register in virtual range."
