slab: clean up kmem_cache_create_memcg() error handling

Currently kmem_cache_create_memcg() backoffs on failure inside
conditionals, without using gotos.  This results in the rollback code
duplication, which makes the function look cumbersome even though on
error we should only free the allocated cache.  Since in the next patch
I am going to add yet another rollback function call on error path
there, let's employ labels instead of conditionals for undoing any
changes on failure to keep things clean.
