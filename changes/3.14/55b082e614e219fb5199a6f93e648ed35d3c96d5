dm snapshot: use dm-bufio prefetch

This patch modifies dm-snapshot so that it prefetches the buffers when
loading the exceptions.

The number of buffers read ahead is specified in the DM_PREFETCH_CHUNKS
macro.  The current value for DM_PREFETCH_CHUNKS (12) was found to
provide the best performance on a single 15k SCSI spindle.  In the
future we may modify this default or make it configurable.

Also, introduce the function dm_bufio_set_minimum_buffers to setup
bufio's number of internal buffers before freeing happens.  dm-bufio may
hold more buffers if enough memory is available.  There is no guarantee
that the specified number of buffers will be available - if you need a
guarantee, use the argument reserved_buffers for
dm_bufio_client_create.
