drivers: hv: Mark the function hv_synic_free_cpu() as static in hv.c

This patch marks the function hv_synic_free_cpu() as static in hv.c
because it is not used outside this file.

Thus, it also eliminates the following warning in hv.c:
drivers/hv/hv.c:304:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘hv_synic_free_cpu’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
