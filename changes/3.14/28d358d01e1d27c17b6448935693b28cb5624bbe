[SCSI] bfa: Firmware patch simplification

This patch includes change to enable firmware patch simplication
feature. This feature is targeted to address the requirement to have
independent patch release for firmware. Prior to 3.2.3, releasing a
patch fix for firmware requires changes to bfa, to use new firmware
images. But with these changes, if the new firmware is flashed on to the
HBA with brocade adapter management utilites, driver uses the new
firmware after checking the patch release byte in the firmware version.
