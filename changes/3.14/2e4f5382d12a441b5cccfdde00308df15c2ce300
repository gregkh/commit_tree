locking/doc: Rename LOCK/UNLOCK to ACQUIRE/RELEASE

The LOCK and UNLOCK barriers as described in our barrier document are
generally known as ACQUIRE and RELEASE barriers in other literature.

Since we plan to introduce the acquire and release nomenclature in
generic kernel primitives we should amend the document to avoid
confusion as to what an acquire/release means.
