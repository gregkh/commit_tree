neigh: fix setting of default gc_* values

This patch fixes bug introduced by:
commit 1d4c8c29841b9991cdf3c7cc4ba7f96a94f104ca
"neigh: restore old behaviour of default parms values"

The thing is that in neigh_sysctl_register, extra1 and extra2 which were
previously set for NEIGH_VAR_GC_* are overwritten. That leads to
nonsense int limits for gc_* variables. So fix this by not touching
extra* fields for gc_* variables.
