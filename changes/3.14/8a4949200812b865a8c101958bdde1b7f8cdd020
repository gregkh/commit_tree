i40e: check multi-bit state correctly

The hash is reported correctly in the rss field if and only if
the filter status is 3.  Other values of filter status mean
different things and we shouldn't depend on a bitwise result.

The issue was that
a & b --> returns true for b={1,2,3}
the fix is
a & b == b

Also refactor this function to use constant operations because we
are in fast path.
