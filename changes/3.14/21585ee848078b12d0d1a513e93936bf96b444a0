ASoC: Add resource managed snd_dmaengine_pcm_register()

For many drivers using the generic dmaengine PCM driver one of the few (or the
only) things left to do in the drivers remove function is to unregister the PCM
device. This patch adds a resource managed version of snd_dmaengine_pcm_register()
which makes it possible to simplify the remove function as well as the error
path in the probe function for those drivers.
