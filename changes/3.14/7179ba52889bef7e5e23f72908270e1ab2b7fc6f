powerpc: Implement arch_spin_is_locked() using arch_spin_value_unlocked()

At a glance these are just the inverse of each other. The one subtlety
is that arch_spin_value_unlocked() takes the lock by value, rather than
as a pointer, which is important for the lockref code.

On the other hand arch_spin_is_locked() doesn't really care, so
implement it in terms of arch_spin_value_unlocked().
