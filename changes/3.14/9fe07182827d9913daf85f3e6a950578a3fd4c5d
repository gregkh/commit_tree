crush: strip firstn conditionals out of crush_choose, rename

Now that indep is handled by crush_choose_indep, rename crush_choose to
crush_choose_firstn and remove all the conditionals.  This ends up
stripping out *lots* of code.

Note that it *also* makes it obvious that the shenanigans we were playing
with r' for uniform buckets were broken for firstn mode.  This appears to
have happened waaaay back in commit dae8bec9 (or earlier)... 2007.

Reflects ceph.git commit 94350996cb2035850bcbece6a77a9b0394177ec9.
