PCI: Remove unused ID-Based Ordering support

My philosophy is unused code is dead code.  And dead code is subject to bit
rot and is a likely source of bugs.  Use it or lose it.

This reverts b48d4425b602 ("PCI: add ID-based ordering enable/disable
support"), removing these interfaces:

    pci_enable_ido()
    pci_disable_ido()

[bhelgaas: split to separate patch, also remove prototypes from pci.h]
