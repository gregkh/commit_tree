ALSA: hda - Enable front audio jacks on one HP desktop model

The front headphone and mic jackes on a HP desktop model (Vendor Id:
0x111d76c7 Subsystem Id: 0x103c2b17) can not work, the codec on this
machine has 8 physical ports, 6 of them are routed to rear jackes
and all of them work very well, while the remaining 2 ports are
routed to front headphone and mic jackes, but the corresponding
pin complex node are not defined correctly.

After apply this fix, the front audio jackes can work very well.
