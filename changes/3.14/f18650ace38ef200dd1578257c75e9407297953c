crush: apply chooseleaf_tries to firstn mode too

Parameterize the attempts for the _firstn choose method, and apply the
rule-specified tries count to firstn mode as well.  Note that we have
slightly different behavior here than with indep:

 If the firstn value is not specified for firstn, we pass through the
 normal attempt count.  This maintains compatibility with legacy behavior.
 Note that this is usually *not* actually N^2 work, though, because of the
 descend_once tunable.  However, descend_once is unfortunately *not* the
 same thing as 1 chooseleaf try because it is only checked on a reject but
 not on a collision.  Sigh.

 In contrast, for indep, if tries is not specified we default to 1
 recursive attempt, because that is simply more sane, and we have the
 option to do so.  The descend_once tunable has no effect for indep.

Reflects ceph.git commit 64aeded50d80942d66a5ec7b604ff2fcbf5d7b63.
