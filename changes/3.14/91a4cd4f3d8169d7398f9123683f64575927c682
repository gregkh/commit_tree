intel_pstate: Remove periodic P state boost

Remove the periodic P state boost.  This code required for some corner
case benchmark tests.  The calculation of the required P state was
incorrect/inaccurate and would not allow P state increase.

This was fixed by a combination of commits:
  2134ed4 cpufreq / intel_pstate: Change to scale off of max P-state
  d253d2a intel_pstate: Improve accuracy by not truncating until final result
