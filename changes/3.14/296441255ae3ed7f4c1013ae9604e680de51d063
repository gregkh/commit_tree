ARM: dts: msm: Fix gpio interrupt and reg length

The summary interrupt is #16 in the SPI space. Unfortunately,
when this device was translated from board files to DT we forgot
to subtract 16 from the interrupt number to translate it into a
SPI interrupt. Also, the register space is larger than 4k, increase
it appropriately so that the gpio driver doesn't try to access
registers outside of its mapping.
