ARM: integrator: Default enable ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT, AUTO_ZRELADDR

ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT and AUTO_ZRELADDR has been enabled as default configs
to integrator platform.

Introduction of PHYS_VIRT config as default would enable phy-to-virt and
virt-to-phy translation function at boot and module loading time
and enforce dynamic reallocation of memory. AUTO_ZRELADDR config would
enable calculation of kernel load address at run time.

PHYS_VIRT config is mutually exclusive to XIP_KERNEL, XIP_KERNEL is used in
systems with NOR flash devices, and ZRELADDR config is mutually exclusive
to ZBOOT_ROM.

Requesting maintainers of Integrator platform to evaluate the changes on the
board and comment, as I dont have the board for testing and also requesting
an ACK.
