staging: comedi: report success/failure of autoconfig

Added success message to the driver autoconfig and error
message in case it fails. A success message is required
so that the user can find out which comedi driver has been
associated with which udev device. This also makes troubleshooting
much easier when more than one card is in the computer or
there is a mix of USB and PCI devices.
As Ian suggested we should report both the driver and the board
which might have different names, especially if one driver covers a
range of different boards.
