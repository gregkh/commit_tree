staging: ft1000: extract helper handle_misc_portid()

The function ft1000_poll, in ft1000_hw.c, is complex, with deep levels
of nesting, unnecessary variables, and style issues. Extract the default
case of the switch statement to its own function, handle_misc_portid.
Make the variable struct dpram_blk *pdpram_blk local to the new function
and remove it from the old. The variable struct pseudo_hdr *ppseudo_hdr is
used only once, to access a member of another struct, so eliminate it
and access the member directly. Return -1 in all the places where the
code fails, and 0 on successful completion. Fix coding style errors.
