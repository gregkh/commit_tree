posix-timers: Use sighand lock instead of tasklist_lock on timer deletion

Timer deletion doesn't need the tasklist lock.
We need to protect against:

* concurrent access to the lists p->cputime_expires and
  p->sighand->cputime_expires

* task reaping that may also delete the timer list entry

* timer firing

We already hold the timer lock which protects us against concurrent
timer firing.

The rest only need the targets sighand to be locked.
So hold it and drop the use of tasklist_lock there.
