i40e: use same number of queues as CPUs

The current driver default sets the number of transmit/receive
queue pairs based on the current node's CPU count.

A better method is to use the total number of CPUs in the system
to suggest the number of queue pairs, which aligns better with
the behavior of ixgbe, and also with the expectations of the
kernel XPS and other subsystems in the stack.
