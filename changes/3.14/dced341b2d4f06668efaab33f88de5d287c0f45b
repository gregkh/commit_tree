tracing: Have trace buffer point back to trace_array

The trace buffer has a descriptor pointer that goes back to the trace
array. But it was never assigned. Luckily, nothing uses it (yet), but
it will in the future.

Although nothing currently uses this, if any of the new features get
backported to older kernels, and because this is such a simple change,
I'm marking it for stable too.
