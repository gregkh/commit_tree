cpufreq: Mark ARM drivers with CPUFREQ_NEED_INITIAL_FREQ_CHECK flag

Sometimes boot loaders set CPU frequency to a value outside of frequency table
present with cpufreq core. In such cases CPU might be unstable if it has to run
on that frequency for long duration of time and so its better to set it to a
frequency which is specified in frequency table.

On some systems we can't really say what frequency we're running at the moment
and so for these we shouldn't check if we are running at a frequency present in
frequency table. And so we really can't force this for all the cpufreq drivers.

Hence we are created another flag here: CPUFREQ_NEED_INITIAL_FREQ_CHECK that
will be marked by platforms which want to go for this check at boot time.

Initially this is done for all ARM platforms but others may follow if required.
