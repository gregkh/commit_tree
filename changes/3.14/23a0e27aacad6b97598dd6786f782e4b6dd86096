gpu: host1x: clk_round_rate() can return a zero upon error

Treat both negative and zero return values from clk_round_rate() as
errors.  This is needed since subsequent patches will convert
clk_round_rate()'s return value to be an unsigned type, rather than a
signed type, since some clock sources can generate rates higher than
(2^31)-1 Hz.

Eventually, when calling clk_round_rate(), only a return value of zero
will be considered a error.  All other values will be considered valid
rates.  The comparison against values less than 0 is kept to preserve
the correct behavior in the meantime.
