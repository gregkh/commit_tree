iommu: add IOMMU_EXEC flag for safely allowing XN mappings

Whilst most IOMMU mappings should probably be non-executable, there
may be cases (HSA?) where executable mappings are required.

This patch introduces a new mapping flag, IOMMU_EXEC, to indicate that
the mapping should be mapped as executable.
