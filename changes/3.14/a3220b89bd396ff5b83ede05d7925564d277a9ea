staging: ft1000: flatten nesting in dsp_broadcast_msg_id()

The function dsp_broadcast_msg_id() has four levels of nesting. Move the
handling for failed allocation for *dpram_blk from the else block at the
end to the block immediately following the test, reverse the sense of the
test, and exit with an error code if the allocation fails. This eliminates
descending into an if block if the allocation is successful. Move all
lines inside the removed block one tab to the left, and join lines
that will fall under the 80 char limit.
