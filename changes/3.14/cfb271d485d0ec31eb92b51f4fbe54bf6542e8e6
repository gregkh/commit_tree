f2fs: add unlikely() macro for compiler optimization

As we know, some of our branch condition will rarely be true. So we could add
'unlikely' to let compiler optimize these code, by this way we could drop
unneeded 'jump' assemble code to improve performance.

change log:
 o add *unlikely* as many as possible across the whole source files at once
