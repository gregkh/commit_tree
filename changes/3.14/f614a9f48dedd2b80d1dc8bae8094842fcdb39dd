zram: remove workqueue for freeing removed pending slot

Commit a0c516cbfc74 ("zram: don't grab mutex in zram_slot_free_noity")
introduced free request pending code to avoid scheduling by mutex under
spinlock and it was a mess which made code lenghty and increased
overhead.

Now, we don't need zram->lock any more to free slot so this patch
reverts it and then, tb_lock should protect it.
