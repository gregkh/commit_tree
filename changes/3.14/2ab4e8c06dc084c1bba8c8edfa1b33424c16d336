ARM: 7947/1: Make pgtbl macro more robust

The pgtbl macro couldn't handle the specific
(TEXT_OFFSET - PG_DIR_SIZE) value that the combination of
MSM platforms and LPAE created:

head.S:163: Error: invalid constant (203000) after fixup

Regardless of whether this combination of configuration options
will work on currently support platforms at run time, make it
at least assemble properly.
