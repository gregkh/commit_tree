can: flexcan: fix shutdown: first disable chip, then all interrupts

When shutting down the CAN interface (ifconfig canX down) during high CAN bus
loads, the CAN core might hang and freeze the whole CPU.

This patch fixes the shutdown sequence by first disabling the CAN core then
disabling all interrupts.
