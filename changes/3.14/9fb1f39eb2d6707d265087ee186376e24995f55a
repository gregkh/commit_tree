gpio/pinctrl: make gpio_chip members typed boolean

This switches the two members of struct gpio_chip that were
defined as unsigned foo:1 to bool, because that is indeed what
they are. Switch all users in the gpio and pinctrl subsystems
to assign these values with true/false instead of 0/1. The
users outside these subsystems will survive since true/false
is 1/0, atleast we set some kind of more strict typing example.
