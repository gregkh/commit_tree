USB: ftdi_sio: added CS5 quirk for broken smartcard readers

Genuine FTDI chips support only CS7/8. A previous fix in commit
8704211f65a2 ("USB: ftdi_sio: fixed handling of unsupported CSIZE
setting") enforced this limitation and reported it back to userspace.

However, certain types of smartcard readers depend on specific
driver behaviour that requests 0 data bits (not 5) to change into a
different operating mode if CS5 has been set.

This patch reenables this behaviour for all FTDI devices.

Tagged to be added to stable, because it affects a lot of users of
embedded systems which rely on these readers to work properly.
