sysfs, kernfs: implement kernfs_create/destroy_root()

There currently is single kernfs hierarchy in the whole system which
is used for sysfs.  kernfs needs to support multiple hierarchies to
allow other users.  This patch introduces struct kernfs_root which
serves as the root of each kernfs hierarchy and implements
kernfs_create/destroy_root().

* Each kernfs_root is associated with a root sd (sysfs_dentry).  The
  root is freed when the root sd is released and kernfs_destory_root()
  simply invokes kernfs_remove() on the root sd.  sysfs_remove_one()
  is updated to handle release of the root sd.  Note that ps_iattr
  update in sysfs_remove_one() is trivially updated for readability.

* Root sd's are now dynamically allocated using sysfs_new_dirent().
  Update sysfs_alloc_ino() so that it gives out ino from 1 so that the
  root sd still gets ino 1.

* While kernfs currently only points to the root sd, it'll soon grow
  fields which are specific to each hierarchy.  As determining a given
  sd's root will be necessary, sd->s_dir.root is added.  This backlink
  fits better as a separate field in sd; however, sd->s_dir is inside
  union with space to spare, so use it to save space and provide
  kernfs_root() accessor to determine the root sd.

* As hierarchies may be destroyed now, each mount needs to hold onto
  the hierarchy it's attached to.  Update sysfs_fill_super() and
  sysfs_kill_sb() so that they get and put the kernfs_root
  respectively.

* sysfs_root is replaced with kernfs_root which is dynamically created
  by invoking kernfs_create_root() from sysfs_init().

This patch doesn't introduce any visible behavior changes.

v2: kernfs_create_root() forgot to set @sd->priv.  Fixed.
