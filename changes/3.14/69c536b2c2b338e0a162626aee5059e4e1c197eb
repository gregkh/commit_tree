[media] v4l: omap4iss: Add support for OMAP4 camera interface - Resizer

This adds a very simplistic driver to utilize the CSI2A interface inside
the ISS subsystem in OMAP4, and dump the data to memory.
Check Documentation/video4linux/omap4_camera.txt for details.
This commit adds resizer support.
[Port the driver to v3.12-rc3, including the following changes
- Don't include plat/ headers
- Don't use cpu_is_omap44xx() macro
- Don't depend on EXPERIMENTAL
- Fix s_crop operation prototype
- Update link_notify prototype
- Rename media_entity_remote_source to media_entity_remote_pad]
