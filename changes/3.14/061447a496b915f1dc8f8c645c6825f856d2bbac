sysfs, kernfs: introduce sysfs_root_sd

Currently, it's assumed that there's a single kernfs hierarchy in the
system anchored at sysfs_root which is defined as a global struct.  To
allow other users of kernfs, this will be made dynamic.  Introduce a
new global variable sysfs_root_sd which points to &sysfs_root and
convert all &sysfs_root users.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior difference.
