kernfs: add kernfs_dir_ops

Add support for mkdir(2), rmdir(2) and rename(2) syscalls.  This is
implemented through optional kernfs_dir_ops callback table which can
be specified on kernfs_create_root().  An implemented callback is
invoked when the matching syscall is invoked.

As kernfs keep dcache syncs with internal representation and
revalidates dentries on each access, the implementation of these
methods is extremely simple.  Each just discovers the relevant
kernfs_node(s) and invokes the requested callback which is allowed to
do any kernfs operations and the end result doesn't necessarily have
to match the expected semantics of the syscall.

This will be used to convert cgroup to use kernfs instead of its own
filesystem implementation.
