uapi, asm-generic: Use __kernel_ulong_t in uapi struct ipc64_perm

x32 IPC system call is the same as x86-64 IPC system call, which uses
64-bit integer for unsigned long in struct ipc64_perm.  But x32 long is
32 bit.  This patch replaces unsigned long in uapi struct ipc64_perm with
__kernel_ulong_t.
