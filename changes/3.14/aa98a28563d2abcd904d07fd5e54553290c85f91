Documentation/misc-devices/mei/mei-amt-version.c: remove unneeded call of mei_deinit()

Building mei-amt-version.o triggers a GCC warning:
    Documentation/misc-devices/mei/mei-amt-version.c: In function 'main':
    Documentation/misc-devices/mei/mei-amt-version.c:103:5: warning: 'acmd.fd' is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
      if (cl->fd != -1)
         ^
    Documentation/misc-devices/mei/mei-amt-version.c:443:21: note: 'acmd.fd' was declared here
      struct amt_host_if acmd;
                         ^

GCC is correct. See, the call chain that GCC detects must be
    main()
        amt_host_if_init()
            mei_init()
                mei_deinit()

But when we enter mei_deinit() struct amt_host_if acmd is still
unitialized. That makes the test for (effectively) amt_host_if->mei_cl->fd
bogus.

But it turns out that call of mei_deinit() isn't needed at all. All of
the members of mei_cl will be set later in mei_init() and none will be
used before they are set. So we can simply drop this call of
mei_deinit().
