KVM: Use cond_resched() directly and remove useless kvm_resched()

Since the commit 15ad7146 ("KVM: Use the scheduler preemption notifiers
to make kvm preemptible"), the remaining stuff in this function is a
simple cond_resched() call with an extra need_resched() check which was
there to avoid dropping VCPUs unnecessarily.  Now it is meaningless.
