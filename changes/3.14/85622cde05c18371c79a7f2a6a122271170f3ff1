ath10k: don't use interrupts for BMI

It's not really necessary for interrupts to be
used for BMI. BMI already assumes there's only one
caller at a time and it works directly with CE.

Make BMI poll for CE completions instead of
waiting for interrupts. This makes disabling
interrupts during early boot possible.
