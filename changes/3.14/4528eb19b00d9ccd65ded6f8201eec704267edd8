ALSA: hda - Fix silent output on Toshiba Satellite L40

Toshiba Satellite L40 with AD1986A codec requires the EAPD of NID 0x1b
to be constantly on, otherwise the output doesn't work.
Unlike most of other AD1986A machines, EAPD is correctly implemented
in HD-audio manner (that is, bit set = amp on), so we need to clear
the inv_eapd flag in the fixup, too.
