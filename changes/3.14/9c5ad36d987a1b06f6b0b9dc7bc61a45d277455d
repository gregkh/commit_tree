ACPI / bind: Redefine acpi_preset_companion()

Modify acpi_preset_companion() to take a struct acpi_device pointer
instead of an ACPI handle as its second argument and redefine it as
a static inline wrapper around ACPI_COMPANION_SET() passing the
return value of acpi_find_child_device() directly as the second
argument to it.  Update its users to pass struct acpi_device
pointers instead of ACPI handles to it.

This allows some unnecessary acpi_bus_get_device() calls to be
avoided.
