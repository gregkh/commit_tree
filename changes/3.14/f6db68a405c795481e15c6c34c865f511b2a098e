iio: mxs-lradc: add scale attribute to channels

Some LRADC channels have fixed pre-dividers and all have an optional
divider by two which allows a maximum input voltage of VDDIO - 50mV.

This patch
 - adds the scaling info flag to all channels
 - grabs the max reference voltage per channel
   (where the fixed pre-dividers apply)
 - allows to read the scaling attribute (computed from the Vref)
