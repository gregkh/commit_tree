ath9k: fix invalid descriptor discarding

Only set sc->rx.discard_next to rx_stats->rs_more when actually
discarding the current descriptor.

Also, fix a detection of broken descriptors:
First the code checks if the current descriptor is not done.
Then it checks if the next descriptor is done.
Add a check that afterwards checks the first descriptor again, because
it might have been completed in the mean time.

This fixes a regression introduced in
commit 723e711356b5a8a95728a890e254e8b0d47b55cf
