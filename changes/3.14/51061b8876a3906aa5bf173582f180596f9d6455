MIPS: math-emu: Fix prefx detection and COP1X function field definition

When running applications which contain the instruction "prefx" on FPU-less
CPUs, a message "Illegal instruction" will be seen. This instruction is
supposed to be ignored by the FPU emulator. However, its current detection
and function field encoding are incorrect. This patch fix the issue.
