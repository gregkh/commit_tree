mtd: gpmi: add a new DT property to use the datasheet's minimum required ECC

In default way, we use the ecc_strength/ecc_step size calculated by ourselves
and use all the OOB area.

This patch adds a new property : "fsl,use-minimum-ecc"

If we enable it, we will firstly try to use the datasheet's minimum required
ECC provided by the MTD layer (the ecc_strength_ds/ecc_step_ds fields
in the nand_chip{}). So we may have free space in the OOB area by using the
minimum ECC, and we may support JFFS2 with some SLC NANDs, such as Micron's
SLC NAND.

If we fail to use the minimum ECC, we will use the legacy method to calculate
the ecc_strength and ecc_step size.
