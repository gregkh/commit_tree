phy: fix compiler array bounds warning on settings[]

With -Werror=array-bounds, gcc v4.7.x warns that in phy_find_valid(), the
settings[] "array subscript is above array bounds", I think because idx is
a signed integer and if the caller supplied idx < 0, we pass the guard but
still reference out of bounds.

Fix this by making idx unsigned here and elsewhere.
