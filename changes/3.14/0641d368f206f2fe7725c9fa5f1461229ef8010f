tracing/kprobes: Add trace event trigger invocations

Add code to the kprobe/kretprobe event functions that will invoke any
event triggers associated with a probe's ftrace_event_file.

The code to do this is very similar to the invocation code already
used to invoke the triggers associated with static events and
essentially replaces the existing soft-disable checks with a superset
that preserves the original behavior but adds the bits needed to
support event triggers.
