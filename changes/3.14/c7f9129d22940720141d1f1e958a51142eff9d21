mfd: twl6040: reg_defaults support for regmap

Add reg_defaults to regmap and at the same time implement proper power
state handling with using regcache_cache_only(), regcache_sync() and
regcache_mark_dirty().

This will make sure that we do not need to do restore operations in child
drivers anymore.
