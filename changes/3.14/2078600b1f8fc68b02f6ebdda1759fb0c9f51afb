ALSA: Revert "ALSA: hda/realtek - Avoid invalid COEFs for ALC271X"

This reverts commit d3c56568f43807135f2c2a09582a69f809f0d8b7.

The reverted commit breaks audio through headphone line out on
the Acer TravelMate B113 (Type1Sku0) Notebook, my main work
machine. I don't know much about it but this fixes my problem.
Bisected and tested.
