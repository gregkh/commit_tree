drm/i915: fix fastboot pfit disable hack to update pipe w/h

When fastbooting, we read out the pipe timings early on, and then in a
panel fitted config, disable the fitter later.  But we weren't updating
the pipe src h/w, which meant the mouse cursor was clipped to the
pfitted size rather than the native size set later.  Fix that up so the
cursor is visible in the new mode.
