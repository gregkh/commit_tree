mmc: sdhci: clear auto cmd setting bits for no data cmds

The auto cmd settings bits should be cleared before sending new commands
or we may receive command timeout error for normal commands due to wrongly
pre-sent auto cmd.

e.g. we receive CMD13 timeout error due to ACMD23 is wrongly enabled
by former data commands.
