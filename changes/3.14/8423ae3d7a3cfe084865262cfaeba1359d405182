block: Fix cloning of discard/write same bios

Immutable biovecs changed the way bio segments are treated in such a way that
bio_for_each_segment() cannot now do what we want for discard/write same bios,
since bi_size means something completely different for them.

Fortunately discard and write same bios never have more than a single biovec, so
bio_for_each_segment() is unnecessary and not terribly meaningful for them, but
we still have to special case them in a few places.
