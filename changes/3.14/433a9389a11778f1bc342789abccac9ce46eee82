Bluetooth: btmrvl: use cal-data from device-tree instead of conf file

Some ARM versions of Chromebook need to download a new calibration
data from host driver to firmware. They do have EEPROM but still
need a piece of new calibration data in test mode.

The cal-data is platform dependent. It's simpler and more feasible
to use device tree based cal-data instead of configuration file
based cal-data.

This patch remove configuration file based cal-data downloading
and replace it using cal-data from device tree.

When CONFIG_OF is not selected, or the specific property is not
present in the device tree, the calibration downloading will not
happen.
