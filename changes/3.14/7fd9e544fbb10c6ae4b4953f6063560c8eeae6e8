f2fs: add a slab cache entry for small discards

This patch adds a slab cache entry for small discards.

Each entry consists of:

struct discard_entry {
	struct list_head list;	/* list head */
	block_t blkaddr;	/* block address to be discarded */
	int len;		/* # of consecutive blocks of the discard */
};
