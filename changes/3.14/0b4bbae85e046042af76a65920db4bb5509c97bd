ASoC: soc-pcm: Drop the redundant snd_soc_dai_digital_mute() in soc_pcm_close()

This patch removed the redundant snd_soc_dai_digital_mute() in close() since
it's better to mute in hw_free() which's slightly earlier and symmetrical for
the case of reconfiguration: 'aplay 44k1.wav 48k.wav', for example, will be
open()->hw_params()->prepare(unmute)->playi1ng->hw_free(mute)->hw_params()->
parepare(unmute)->playing->hw_free(mute)->close()
