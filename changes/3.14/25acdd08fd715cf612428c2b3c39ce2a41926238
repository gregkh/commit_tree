usb: phy: add Keystone usb phy driver

Add Keystone platform USB PHY driver support. Current main purpose
of this driver is to enable the PHY reference clock gate on the
Keystone SoC. Otherwise it is a nop PHY.

[ balbi@ti.com : add COMPILE_TEST as a possible dependency
	make sure drvdata is initialized before adding PHY ]
