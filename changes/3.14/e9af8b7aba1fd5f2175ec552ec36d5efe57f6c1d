parisc: wire up sys_utimes

We seem to be nearly the only platform which does not provide the
sys_utimes syscall.  Adding it now makes our life much easier with
userspace applications (like dietlibc and e2fsprogs) since we then
behave like all other platforms too and don't need extra patches which
are hard to get upstream anyway because we are not a mainstream
architecture.
