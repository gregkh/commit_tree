dmaengine: Add MOXA ART DMA engine driver

The MOXA ART SoC has a DMA controller capable of offloading expensive
memory operations, such as large copies. This patch adds support for
the controller including four channels. Two of these are used to
handle MMC copy on the UC-7112-LX hardware. The remaining two can be
used in a future audio driver or client application.
