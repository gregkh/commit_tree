mm/rmap: factor nonlinear handling out of try_to_unmap_file()

To merge all kinds of rmap traverse functions, try_to_unmap(),
try_to_munlock(), page_referenced() and page_mkclean(), we need to
extract common parts and separate out non-common parts.

Nonlinear handling is handled just in try_to_unmap_file() and other rmap
traverse functions doesn't care of it.  Therfore it is better to factor
nonlinear handling out of try_to_unmap_file() in order to merge all
kinds of rmap traverse functions easily.
