powerpc/85xx: add hardware automatically enter altivec idle state

Each core's AltiVec unit may be placed into a power savings mode
by turning off power to the unit. Core hardware will automatically
power down the AltiVec unit after no AltiVec instructions have
executed in N cycles. The AltiVec power-control is triggered by hardware.
