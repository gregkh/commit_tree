pkt_sched: give visibility to mq slave qdiscs

Commit 6da7c8fcbcbd ("qdisc: allow setting default queuing discipline")
added the ability to change default qdisc from pfifo_fast to say fq

But as most modern ethernet devices are multiqueue, we cant really
see all the statistics from "tc -s qdisc show", as the default root
qdisc is mq.

This patch adds the calls to qdisc_list_add() to mq and mqprio
