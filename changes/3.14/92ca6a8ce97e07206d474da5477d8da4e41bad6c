clk: emev2: Add support for emev2 SMU clocks with DT

Device tree clock binding document for EMMA Mobile EV2 SMU,
And Common clock framework based implementation of it.
Following nodes are defined to describe clock tree.
- renesas,emev2-smu
- renesas,emev2-smu-clkdiv
- renesas,emev2-smu-gclk

These bindings are designed manually based on
 19UH0037EJ1000_SMU : System Management Unit User's Manual

So far, reparent is not implemented, and is fixed to index #0.
Clock tree description is not included, and should be provided
by device-tree.
