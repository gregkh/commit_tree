x86: Export x86 boot_params to sysfs

kexec-tools use boot_params for getting the 1st kernel hardware_subarch,
the kexec kernel EFI runtime support also needs to read the old efi_info
from boot_params. Currently it exists in debugfs which is not a good
place for such infomation. Per HPA, we should avoid "sploit debugfs".

In this patch /sys/kernel/boot_params are exported, also the setup_data is
exported as a subdirectory. kexec-tools is using debugfs for hardware_subarch
for a long time now so we're not removing it yet.

Structure is like below:

/sys/kernel/boot_params
|__ data                /* boot_params in binary*/
|__ setup_data
|   |__ 0               /* the first setup_data node */
|   |   |__ data        /* setup_data node 0 in binary*/
|   |   |__ type        /* setup_data type of setup_data node 0, hex string */
[snip]
|__ version             /* boot protocal version (in hex, "0x" prefixed)*/
