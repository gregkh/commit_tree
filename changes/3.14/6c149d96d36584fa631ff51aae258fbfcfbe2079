drivers: gpu: Include appropriate header file in si_smc.c and remove prototype declaration from header file sislands_smc.h

Include header file gpu/drm/radeon/sislands_smc.h in drm/radeon/si_smc.c
because it uses function declared in the header file.

Remove prototype declaration of function si_set_smc_sram_address() from
drm/radeon/sislands_smc.h because the function is used only in one file
where it is declared static already.

This eliminates the following warnings in drm/radeon/si_smc.c:
