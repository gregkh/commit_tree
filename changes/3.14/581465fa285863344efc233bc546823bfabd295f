tipc: make link start event synchronous

When a link is created we delay the start event by launching it
to be executed later in a tasklet. As we hold all the
necessary locks at the moment of creation, and there is no risk
of deadlock or contention, this delay serves no purpose in the
current code.

We remove this obsolete indirection step, and the associated function
link_start(). At the same time, we rename the function tipc_link_stop()
to the more appropriate tipc_link_purge_queues().
