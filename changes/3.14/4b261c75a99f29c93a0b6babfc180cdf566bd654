ipv6: make IPV6_RECVPKTINFO work for ipv4 datagrams

We currently don't report IPV6_RECVPKTINFO in cmsg access ancillary data
for IPv4 datagrams on IPv6 sockets.

This patch splits the ip6_datagram_recv_ctl into two functions, one
which handles both protocol families, AF_INET and AF_INET6, while the
ip6_datagram_recv_specific_ctl only handles IPv6 cmsg data.

ip6_datagram_recv_*_ctl never reported back any errors, so we can make
them return void. Also provide a helper for protocols which don't offer dual
personality to further use ip6_datagram_recv_ctl, which is exported to
modules.

I needed to shuffle the code for ping around a bit to make it easier to
implement dual personality for ping ipv6 sockets in future.
