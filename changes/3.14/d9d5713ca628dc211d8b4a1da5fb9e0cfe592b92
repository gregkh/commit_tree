RDMA/amso1100: Add check if cache memory was allocated before freeing it

There is a path in handle_vq() where kmem_cache_free() can be called
with pointer to a local variable.  It can happen if vq_repbuf_alloc()
failed to allocate memory from cache and req is NULL.

The patch adds check if cache memory was allocated before freeing it.
