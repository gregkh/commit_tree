drm/i915/vlv: use a lower RC6 timeout on VLV

We use timeout mode, and we need to lower the timeout to get good RC6
residency when loads are running.  This gets me from 0% residency during
glxgears to 77%, which is a pretty good improvement.  This value also
matches the current BWG recommentations.
