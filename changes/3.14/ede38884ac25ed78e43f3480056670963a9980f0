ASoC: SPEAr: get rid of spear-pcm-audio struct device

Modify the SPEAr PCM driver so that it's a utility library that can be
registered on each DAI, rather than a separate struct device. This is
more in line with how many recent DT-converted platforms operate, and
avoids the need for yet another struct device.

This is also required as a pre-cursor to removing
spear_pcm_request_chan().
