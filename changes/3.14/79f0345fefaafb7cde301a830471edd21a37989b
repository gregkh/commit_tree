scripts: Coccinelle script for pm_runtime_* return checks with IS_ERR_VALUE

As indicated by Sekhar in [1], there seems to be a tendency to use
IS_ERR_VALUE to check the error result for pm_runtime_* functions which
make no sense considering commit c48cd65 (ARM: OMAP: use consistent
error checking) - the error values can either be < 0 for error OR
0, 1 in cases where we have success.

So, setup a coccinelle script to help identify the same.
