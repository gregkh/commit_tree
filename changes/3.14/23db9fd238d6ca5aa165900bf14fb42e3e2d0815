usb: musb: fix setting JZ4740 gadget periphal mode on reset

JZ4740 USB Device Controller is not OTG compatible and does not have
DEVCTL register in silicon.

During ethernet-over-usb transactions, on reset, musb driver tries to
read from DEVCTL and consequently sets device as host (A-Device)
instead of peripheral (B-Device), which makes it a composite device to
the USB gadget driver.
This induces a kernel panic during power down where the USB gadget
driver does a null pointer dereference when trying to access the
composite device configuration.

On reset, do not rely on DEVCTL value for setting gadget peripheral
mode. Use is_otg flag instead to set it to B-Device.
