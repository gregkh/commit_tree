dm cache: fix truncation bug when copying a block to/from >2TB fast device

During demotion or promotion to a cache's >2TB fast device we must not
truncate the cache block's associated sector to 32bits.  The 32bit
temporary result of from_cblock() caused a 32bit multiplication when
calculating the sector of the fast device in issue_copy_real().

Use an intermediate 64bit type to store the 32bit from_cblock() to allow
for proper 64bit multiplication.

Here is an example of how this bug manifests on an ext4 filesystem:

 EXT4-fs error (device dm-0): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:756: group 17136, 32768 clusters in bitmap, 30688 in gd; block bitmap corrupt.
 JBD2: Spotted dirty metadata buffer (dev = dm-0, blocknr = 0). There's a risk of filesystem corruption in case of system crash.
