MIPS: Support for 64-bit FP with O32 binaries

CPUs implementing MIPS32 R2 may include a 64-bit FPU, just as MIPS64 CPUs
do. In order to preserve backwards compatibility a 64-bit FPU will act
like a 32-bit FPU (by accessing doubles from the least significant 32
bits of an even-odd pair of FP registers) when the Status.FR bit is
zero, again just like a mips64 CPU. The standard O32 ABI is defined
expecting a 32-bit FPU, however recent toolchains support use of a
64-bit FPU from an O32 MIPS32 executable. When an ELF executable is
built to use a 64-bit FPU a new flag (EF_MIPS_FP64) is set in the ELF
header.

With this patch the kernel will check the EF_MIPS_FP64 flag when
executing an O32 binary, and set Status.FR accordingly. The addition
of O32 64-bit FP support lessens the opportunity for optimisation in
the FPU emulator, so a CONFIG_MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT Kconfig option is
introduced to allow this support to be disabled for those that don't
require it.

Inspired by an earlier patch by Leonid Yegoshin, but implemented more
cleanly & correctly.
