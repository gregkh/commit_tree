ocfs2: return EINVAL if the given range to discard is less than block size

For FITRIM ioctl(2), we should not keep silence if the given range
length ls less than a block size as there is no data blocks would be
discareded.  Hence it should return EINVAL instead.  This issue can be
verified via xfstests/generic/288 which is used for FITRIM argument
handling tests.
