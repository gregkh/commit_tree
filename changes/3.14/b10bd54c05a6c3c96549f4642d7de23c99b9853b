tcp: correct code comment stating 3 min timeout for FIN_WAIT2, we only do 1 min

As far as I can tell we have used a default of 60 seconds for
FIN_WAIT2 timeout for ages (since 2.x times??).

In any case, the timeout these days is 60 seconds, so the 3 min
comment is wrong (and cost me a few minutes of my life when I was
debugging a FIN_WAIT2 related problem in a userspace application and
checked the kernel source for details).
