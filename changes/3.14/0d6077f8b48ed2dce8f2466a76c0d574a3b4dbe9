lib/scatterlist: export sg_miter_skip()

sg_copy_buffer() can't meet demand for some drrivers(such usb
mass storage), so we have to use the sg_miter_* APIs to access
sg buffer, then need export sg_miter_skip() for these drivers.

The API is needed for converting to sg_miter_* APIs in USB storage
driver for accessing sg buffer.
