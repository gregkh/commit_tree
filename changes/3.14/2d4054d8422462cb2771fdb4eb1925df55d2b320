ACPI: Blacklist Win8 OSI for some HP laptop 2013 models

The BIOS on recent HP laptops behaves differently with Win8 OSI,
e.g. no backlight control and no rfkill are available.  List them in
the blacklist as a workaround.

This patch tries to reduce the added items by matching "G1" suffix,
e.g. machines are named like "HP ProBook 430 G1".
