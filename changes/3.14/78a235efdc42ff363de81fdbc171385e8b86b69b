powerpc/fsl_booke: set the tlb entry for the kernel address in AS1

We use the tlb1 entries to map low mem to the kernel space. In the
current code, it assumes that the first tlb entry would cover the
kernel image. But this is not true for some special cases, such as
when we run a relocatable kernel above the 64M or set
CONFIG_KERNEL_START above 64M. So we choose to switch to address
space 1 before setting these tlb entries.
