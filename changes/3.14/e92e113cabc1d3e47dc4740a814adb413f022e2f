netprio_cgroup: convert away from cftype->read_map()

In preparation of conversion to kernfs, cgroup file handling is being
consolidated so that it can be easily mapped to the seq_file based
interface of kernfs.

cftype->read_map() doesn't add any value and being replaced with
->read_seq_string().  Update read_priomap() to use ->read_seq_string()
instead.

This patch doesn't make any visible behavior changes.
