ACPI / hotplug: Add demand_offline hotplug profile flag

Add a new ACPI hotplug profile flag, demand_offline, such that if
set for the given ACPI device object's scan handler, it will cause
acpi_scan_hot_remove() to check if that device object's physical
companions are offline upfront and fail the hot removal if that
is not the case.

That flag will be useful to overcome a problem with containers on
some system where they can only be hot-removed after some cleanup
operations carried out by user space, which needs to be notified
of the container hot-removal before the kernel attempts to offline
devices in the container.  In those cases the current implementation
of acpi_scan_hot_remove() is not sufficient, because it first tries
to offline the devices in the container and only if that is
suffcessful it tries to offline the container itself.  As a result,
the container hot-removal notification is not delivered to user space
at the right time.
