ARM: OMAP3: Fix pinctrl interrupts for core2

After splitting padconf core into two parts to avoid exposing
unaccessable registers, the new padconf core2 domain was left
without a wake-up interrupt.

Fix the issue by passing the shared wake-up interrupt in
platform data like we do for padconf core and wkup domains
already.
