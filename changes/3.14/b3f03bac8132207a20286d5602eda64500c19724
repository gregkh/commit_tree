xfs: xfs_dir2_block_to_sf temp buffer allocation fails

If we are using a large directory block size, and memory becomes
fragmented, we can get memory allocation failures trying to
kmem_alloc(64k) for a temporary buffer. However, there is not need
for a directory buffer sized allocation, as the end result ends up
in the inode literal area. This is, at most, slightly less than 2k
of space, and hence we don't need an allocation larger than that
fora temporary buffer.
