staging: comedi: dt3000: remove DEBUG define

This define unables some debug code that prints the status flags
during the interrupt handler. These messages are just added noise
and it's probably not a good idea to spew them during the interrupt
anyway.

Remove the DEBUG define as well as the debug code.
