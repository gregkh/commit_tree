perf tools: Do proper comm override error handling

The comm overriding API ignores memory allocation failures by silently
keeping the previous and out of date comm.

As a result, the user may get buggy events without ever being notified
about the problem and its source.

Lets start to fix this by propagating the error from the API. Not all
callers may be doing proper error handling on comm set yet but this is
the first step toward it.
