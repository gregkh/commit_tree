s390/cio: improve cio_commit_config

The modify subchannel wrapper cio_commit_config can fail when
(unexpected) status is pending on the subchannel.

Callers of cio_commit_config (that operated on enabled subchannels)
needed to do error handling for that case (clear the unexpected
status with test subchannel and retry). This error handling is
missing in some code paths and caused online setting of devices to
fail.

Fix this for all callers by moving the error handling inside
cio_commit_config.
