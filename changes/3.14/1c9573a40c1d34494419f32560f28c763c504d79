thermal: fix cpu_cooling max_level behavior

As per Documentation/thermal/sysfs-api.txt, max_level
is an index, not a counter. Thus, in case a CPU has
3 valid frequencies, max_level is expected to be 2, for instance.

The current code makes max_level == number of valid frequencies,
which is bogus. This patch fix the cpu_cooling device by
ranging max_level properly.
