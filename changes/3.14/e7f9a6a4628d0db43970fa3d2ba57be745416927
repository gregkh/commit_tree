mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Fix SEQIN column address set

This commit adds support page programming with a non-zero "column"
address setting. This is important to support OOB writing, through
command sequences such as:

  cmdfunc(mtd, NAND_CMD_SEQIN, mtd->writesize, ofs);
  write_buf(mtd, oob_buf, 6);
  cmdfunc(mtd, NAND_CMD_PAGEPROG, -1, -1);
