s390/cpum_sf: Add raw data sampling to support the diagnostic-sampling function

Also support the diagnostic-sampling function in addition to the basic-sampling
function.  Diagnostic-sampling data entries contain hardware model specific
sampling data and additional programs are required to analyze the data.

To deliver diagnostic-sampling, as well, as basis-sampling data entries to user
space, introduce support for sampling "raw data".  If this particular perf
sampling type (PERF_SAMPLE_RAW) is used, sampling data entries are copied
to user space.  External programs can then analyze these data.
