Documentation/memory-barriers.txt: Fix a typo in the data dependency description

This typo has been there forever, it is 7.5 years old, looks like this
section of our memory ordering documentation is a place where most eyes
are glazed over already ;-)

[ Also fix some stray spaces and stray tabs while at it, shrinking the
  file by 49 bytes. Visual output unchanged. ]
