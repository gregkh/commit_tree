powerpc/powernv: Dump PHB diag-data immediately

The PHB diag-data is important to help locating the root cause for
EEH errors such as frozen PE or fenced PHB. However, the EEH core
enables IO path by clearing part of HW registers before collecting
this data causing it to be corrupted.

This patch fixes this by dumping the PHB diag-data immediately when
frozen/fenced state on PE or PHB is detected for the first time in
eeh_ops::get_state() or next_error() backend.
