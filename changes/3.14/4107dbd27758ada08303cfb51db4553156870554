iwlwifi: mvm: rs: remove unnecessary debug logs

The logs are emitted in a flow in which there were retries
and the rates in the rate table entry didn't match the active
or search table. This doesn't indicate a problem and is
expected in most cases where there will be retries for some
reason. Remove the logs.
