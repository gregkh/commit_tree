mm/rmap: factor lock function out of rmap_walk_anon()

When we traverse anon_vma, we need to take a read-side anon_lock.  But
there is subtle difference in the situation so that we can't use same
method to take a lock in each cases.  Therefore, we need to make
rmap_walk_anon() taking difference lock function.

This patch is the first step, factoring lock function for anon_lock out
of rmap_walk_anon().  It will be used in case of removing migration
entry and in default of rmap_walk_anon().
