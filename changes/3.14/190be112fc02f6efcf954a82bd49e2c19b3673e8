drm/i915: use IS_HASWELL/BROADWELL instead of HAS_POWER_WELL

In intel_display_capture_error_state we use HAS_POWER_WELL to check if
we are running on Haswell/Broadwell when accessing HSW_PWR_WELL_DRIVER
which is specific to these platforms. Future platforms with power wells
don't have this register, so HAS_POWER_WELL won't work there any more.
Use IS_HASWELL/IS_BROADWELL instead.
