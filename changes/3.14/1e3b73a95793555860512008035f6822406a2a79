tpm: Pull all driver sysfs code into tpm-sysfs.c

The tpm core now sets up and controls all sysfs attributes, instead
of having each driver have a unique take on it.

All drivers now now have a uniform set of attributes, and no sysfs
related entry points are exported from the tpm core module.

This also uses the new method used to declare sysfs attributes
with DEVICE_ATTR_RO and 'struct attribute *'
