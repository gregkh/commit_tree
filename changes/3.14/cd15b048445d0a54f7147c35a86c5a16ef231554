powerpc/powernv: Add iommu DMA bypass support for IODA2

This patch adds the support for to create a direct iommu "bypass"
window on IODA2 bridges (such as Power8) allowing to bypass iommu
page translation completely for 64-bit DMA capable devices, thus
significantly improving DMA performances.

Additionally, this adds a hook to the struct iommu_table so that
the IOMMU API / VFIO can disable the bypass when external ownership
is requested, since in that case, the device will be used by an
environment such as userspace or a KVM guest which must not be
allowed to bypass translations.
