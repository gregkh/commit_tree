x86, intel-mid: sfi_handle_*_dev() should check for pdata error code

When Intel MID finds a match between SFI table from FW and registered
SFI devices, it will always register a device regardless the platform
code was successful or not.

This patch adds an extra option for platform code to return error code
and abort device registration on SFI table parsing.

This patch does not contain any functional changes for current intel
mid platform code.
