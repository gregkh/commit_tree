bridge: Fix inabillity to retrieve vlan tags when tx offload is disabled

Bridge vlan code (br_vlan_get_tag()) assumes that all frames have vlan_tci
if they are tagged, but if vlan tx offload is manually disabled on bridge
device and frames are sent from vlan device on the bridge device, the tags
are embedded in skb->data and they break this assumption.
Extract embedded vlan tags and move them to vlan_tci at ingress.
