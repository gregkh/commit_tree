xhci: replace xhci_readl() with readl()

Function xhci_readl() is used to read 32bit xHC registers residing in MMIO
address space. It takes as first argument a pointer to the xhci_hcd although
it does not use it. xhci_readl() internally simply calls readl(). This creates
an illusion that xhci_readl() is an xhci specific function that has to be
called in a context where a pointer to xhci_hcd is available.

Remove the unnecessary xhci_readl() wrapper function and replace its calls to
with calls to readl() to make the code more straightforward.
