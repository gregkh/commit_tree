Btrfs: rework ulist with list+rb_tree

We are really suffering from now ulist's implementation, some developers
gave their try, and i just gave some of my ideas for things:

 1. use list+rb_tree instead of arrary+rb_tree

 2. add cur_list to iterator rather than ulist structure.

 3. add seqnum into every node when they are added, this is
 used to do selfcheck when iterating node.

I noticed Zach Brown's comments before, long term is to kick off
ulist implementation, however, for now, we need at least avoid
arrary from ulist.
