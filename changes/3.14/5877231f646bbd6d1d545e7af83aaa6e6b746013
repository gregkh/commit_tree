mm: Move change_prot_numa outside CONFIG_ARCH_USES_NUMA_PROT_NONE

change_prot_numa should work even if _PAGE_NUMA != _PAGE_PROTNONE.
On archs like ppc64 that don't use _PAGE_PROTNONE and also have
a separate page table outside linux pagetable, we just need to
make sure that when calling change_prot_numa we flush the
hardware page table entry so that next page access  result in a numa
fault.

We still need to make sure we use the numa faulting logic only
when CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING is set. This implies the migrate-on-fault
(Lazy migration) via mbind will only work if CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING
is set.
