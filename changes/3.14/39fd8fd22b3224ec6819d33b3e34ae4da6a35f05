sched: Fix up scheduler syscall LTP fails

Wu reported LTP failures:

  > ltp.sched_setparam02.1.TFAIL
  > ltp.sched_setparam02.2.TFAIL
  > ltp.sched_setparam02.3.TFAIL
  > ltp.sched_setparam03.1.TFAIL

There were 2 things wrong; firstly __setscheduler() failed on
sched_setparam()'s policy = -1, fix that by reading from p->policy in
that case.

Secondly, getparam() (and getattr()) would still report !0
sched_priority for !FIFO/RR tasks after having been such. So
unconditionally set p->rt_priority.
