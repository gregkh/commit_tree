drm/i915: Fix timeout with missed interrupts in __wait_seqno

Commit 094f9a54e355 ("drm/i915: Fix __wait_seqno to use true infinite
timeouts") added support for __wait_seqno to detect missing interrupts and
go around them by polling. As there is also timeout detection in
__wait_seqno, the polling and timeout detection were done with the same
timer.

When there has been missed interrupts and polling is needed, the timer is
set to trigger in (now + 1) jiffies in future, instead of the caller
specified timeout.

Now when io_schedule() returns, we calculate the jiffies left to timeout
using the timer expiration value. As the current jiffies is now bound to be
always equal or greater than the expiration value, the timeout_jiffies will
become zero or negative and we return -ETIME to caller even tho the
timeout was never reached.

Fix this by decoupling timeout calculation from timer expiration.

v2: Commit message with some sense in it (Chris Wilson)

v3: add parenthesis on timeout_expire calculation

v4: don't read jiffies without timeout (Chris Wilson)
