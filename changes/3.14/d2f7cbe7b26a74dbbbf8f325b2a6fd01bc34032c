x86/efi: Runtime services virtual mapping

We map the EFI regions needed for runtime services non-contiguously,
with preserved alignment on virtual addresses starting from -4G down
for a total max space of 64G. This way, we provide for stable runtime
services addresses across kernels so that a kexec'd kernel can still use
them.

Thus, they're mapped in a separate pagetable so that we don't pollute
the kernel namespace.

Add an efi= kernel command line parameter for passing miscellaneous
options and chicken bits from the command line.

While at it, add a chicken bit called "efi=old_map" which can be used as
a fallback to the old runtime services mapping method in case there's
some b0rkage with a particular EFI implementation (haha, it is hard to
hold up the sarcasm here...).

Also, add the UEFI RT VA space to Documentation/x86/x86_64/mm.txt.
