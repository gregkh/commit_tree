perf/x86: Fix leak in uncore_type_init failure paths

The error path of uncore_type_init() frees up any allocations
that were made along the way, but it relies upon type->pmus
being set, which only happens if the function succeeds. As
type->pmus remains null in this case, the call to
uncore_type_exit will do nothing.

Moving the assignment earlier will allow us to actually free
those allocations should something go awry.
