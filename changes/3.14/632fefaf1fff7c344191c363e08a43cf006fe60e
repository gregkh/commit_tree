uio: fix devm_request_irq usage

Commit e6789cd3dfb553077606ccafeb05e0043f072481 (uio: Simplify uio error
path by using devres functions) converted uio to use devm_request_irq().
This introduced a change in behaviour since the IRQ is associated with
the parent device instead of the created UIO device. The IRQ will remain
active after uio_unregister_device() is called, and some drivers will
crash because of this. The patch fixes this.
