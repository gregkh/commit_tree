x86, tsc: Add static (MSR) TSC calibration on Intel Atom SoCs

On SoCs that have the calibration MSRs available, either there is no
PIT, HPET or PMTIMER to calibrate against, or the PIT/HPET/PMTIMER is
driven from the same clock as the TSC, so calibration is redundant and
just slows down the boot.

TSC rate is caculated by this formula:
<maximum core-clock to bus-clock ratio> * <maximum resolved frequency>
The ratio and the resolved frequency ID can be obtained from MSR.
See Intel 64 and IA-32 System Programming Guid section 16.12 and 30.11.5
for details.
