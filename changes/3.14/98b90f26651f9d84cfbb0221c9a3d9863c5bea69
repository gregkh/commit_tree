bonding: RCUify bond_ab_arp_probe

Currently bond_ab_arp_probe() is always called under rcu_read_lock(),
however to work with curr_active_slave we're still holding the
curr_slave_lock.

To remove that curr_slave_lock - rcu_dereference the bond's
curr_active_slave and use it further - so that we're sure the slave won't
go away, and we don't care if it will change in the meanwhile.
