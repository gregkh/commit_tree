staging/lustre/lu: shrink lu_object by 8 bytes on x86_64

Remove the lo_depth member from struct lu_object.  This field is never
set and only read in lu_object_print().  Remove the lo_flags member.
This field was only used in lu_object_alloc() and can be replaced with
an on-stack mask to keep trace of which layers have been allocated.
