ARM: sun7i: dt: Fix interrupt trigger types

The Allwinner A20 uses the ARM GIC as its internal interrupts controller. The
GIC can work on several interrupt triggers, and the A20 was actually setting it
up to use a rising edge as a trigger, while it was actually a level high
trigger, leading to some interrupts that would be completely ignored if the
edge was missed.

Fix this for the remaining DT nodes that slipped through.
