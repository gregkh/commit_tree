usb: phy: msm: fix compilation errors when !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP

Both the PM_RUNTIME and PM_SLEEP callbacks call into the common
msm_otg_{suspend,resume} routines, however these routines are only being
built when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.  In addition, msm_otg_{suspend,resume} also
depends on msm_hsusb_config_vddcx(), which is only built when
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.

Fix the CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME, !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP case by changing the
preprocessor conditional, and moving msm_hsusb_config_vddcx().

While we're here, eliminate the CONFIG_PM conditional for setting
up the dev_pm_ops.

This address the following errors Russell King has hit doing randconfig
builds:

drivers/usb/phy/phy-msm-usb.c: In function 'msm_otg_runtime_suspend':
drivers/usb/phy/phy-msm-usb.c:1691:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'msm_otg_suspend'
drivers/usb/phy/phy-msm-usb.c: In function 'msm_otg_runtime_resume':
drivers/usb/phy/phy-msm-usb.c:1699:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'msm_otg_resume'
