[media] This adds support for the BCM2048 radio module found in Nokia N900

Add suport for Nokia N900 radio. This driver is far from being ready
to be added at the main tree, as it creates its own sysfs interface,
and violates lots of Coding Style rules, doing even evil things like
returning from a function inside a macro.

So, it is being added at staging with the condition that it will be
soon be fixed.
