Revert "ARM: dts: imx: use dual-fifo sdma script for ssi"

This reverts commit b1d27c79c8377df1880447375deffa3bb82c7bd3.

Previously we switched the SSI scriprt to dual-fifo mode to reduce playback
underrun issue, which is only included by SDMA firmware version 2. However,
there are quite a lot people still using version 1 or default firmware in
the ROM code of SoC while these two kinds of firmwares do not support the
dual-fifo script and the audio function on their platform would be broken.

Thus this patch provisionally reverts the dual-fifo script to the original
single fifo script to meet all kinds of users' requirements, including the
version 1/2 or inner ROM firmware.
