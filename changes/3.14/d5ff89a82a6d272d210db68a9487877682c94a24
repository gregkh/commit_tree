clk: tegra: simplify periph clock data

This patch determines the register bank for clock enable/disable and reset
based on the clock ID instead of hardcoding it in the tables describing the
clocks. This results in less data to be maintained in the tables, making the
code easier to understand. The full benefit of the change will be realized once
also other clocktypes will be table based.
