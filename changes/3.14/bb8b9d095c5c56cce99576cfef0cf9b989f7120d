kernfs: add @mode to kernfs_create_dir[_ns]()

sysfs assumed 0755 for all newly created directories and kernfs
inherited it.  This assumption is unnecessarily restrictive and
inconsistent with kernfs_create_file[_ns]().  This patch adds @mode
parameter to kernfs_create_dir[_ns]() and update uses in sysfs
accordingly.  Among others, this will be useful for implementations of
the planned ->mkdir() method.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior differences.
