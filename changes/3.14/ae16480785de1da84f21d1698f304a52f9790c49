Introduce three interfaces to patch kernel and module code:
aarch64_insn_patch_text_nosync():
	patch code without synchronization, it's caller's responsibility
	to synchronize all CPUs if needed.
aarch64_insn_patch_text_sync():
	patch code and always synchronize with stop_machine()
aarch64_insn_patch_text():
	patch code and synchronize with stop_machine() if needed
