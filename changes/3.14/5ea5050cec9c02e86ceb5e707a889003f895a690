GFS2: Implement a "rgrp has no extents longer than X" scheme

With the preceding patch, we started accepting block reservations
smaller than the ideal size, which requires a lot more parsing of the
bitmaps. To reduce the amount of bitmap searching, this patch
implements a scheme whereby each rgrp keeps track of the point
at this multi-block reservations will fail.
