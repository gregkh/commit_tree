ipc,mqueue: remove limits for the amount of system-wide queues

Commit 93e6f119c0ce ("ipc/mqueue: cleanup definition names and
locations") added global hardcoded limits to the amount of message
queues that can be created.  While these limits are per-namespace,
reality is that it ends up breaking userspace applications.
Historically users have, at least in theory, been able to create up to
INT_MAX queues, and limiting it to just 1024 is way too low and dramatic
for some workloads and use cases.  For instance, Madars reports:

 "This update imposes bad limits on our multi-process application.  As
  our app uses approaches that each process opens its own set of queues
  (usually something about 3-5 queues per process).  In some scenarios
  we might run up to 3000 processes or more (which of-course for linux
  is not a problem).  Thus we might need up to 9000 queues or more.  All
  processes run under one user."

Other affected users can be found in launchpad bug #1155695:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/manpages/+bug/1155695

Instead of increasing this limit, revert it entirely and fallback to the
original way of dealing queue limits -- where once a user's resource
limit is reached, and all memory is used, new queues cannot be created.
