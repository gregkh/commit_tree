KVM: arm-vgic: Set base addr through device API

Support setting the distributor and cpu interface base addresses in the
VM physical address space through the KVM_{SET,GET}_DEVICE_ATTR API
in addition to the ARM specific API.

This has the added benefit of being able to share more code in user
space and do things in a uniform manner.

Also deprecate the older API at the same time, but backwards
compatibility will be maintained.
