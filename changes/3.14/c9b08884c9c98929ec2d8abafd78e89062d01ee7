perf/x86: Correctly use FEATURE_PDCM

The current code simply assumes Intel Arch PerfMon v2+ to have
the IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES MSR; the SDM specifies that we should check
CPUID[1].ECX[15] (aka, FEATURE_PDCM) instead.

This was found by KVM which implements v2+ but didn't provide the
capabilities MSR. Change the code to DTRT; KVM will also implement the
MSR and return 0.
