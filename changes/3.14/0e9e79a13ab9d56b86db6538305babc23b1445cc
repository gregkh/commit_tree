tools lib traceevent: fix pointer-integer size mismatch

The scsi and cfg80211 plugins cast between unsigned long long and
pointers, which is problematic for architectures where unsigned long
long is wider than the native pointer size:

  linux/tools/lib/traceevent/plugin_scsi.c: In function ‘process_scsi_trace_parse_cdb’:
  linux/tools/lib/traceevent/plugin_scsi.c:408:26: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
    scsi_trace_parse_cdb(s, (unsigned char *) args[1], args[2]);

  linux/tools/lib/traceevent/plugin_cfg80211.c: In function ‘process___le16_to_cpup’:
  linux/tools/lib/traceevent/plugin_cfg80211.c:11:18: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
    uint16_t *val = (uint16_t *) args[0];

This patch adds an intermediate cast to unsigned long, silencing the
warning.
