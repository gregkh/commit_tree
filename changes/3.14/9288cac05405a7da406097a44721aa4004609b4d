mmc: core: sd: implement proper support for sd3.0 au sizes

This reverts and updates commit 77776fd0a4cc541b9 ("mmc: sd: fix the
maximum au_size for SD3.0"). The au_size for SD3.0 cannot be achieved
by a simple bit shift, so this needs to be implemented differently.
Also, don't print the warning in case of 0 since 'not defined' is
different from 'invalid'.
