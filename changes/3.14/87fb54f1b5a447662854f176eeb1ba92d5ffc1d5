cgroup: css iterations and css_from_dir() are safe under cgroup_mutex

Currently, all css iterations and css_from_dir() require RCU read lock
whether the caller is holding cgroup_mutex or not, which is
unnecessarily restrictive.  They are all safe to use under
cgroup_mutex without holding RCU read lock.

Factor out cgroup_assert_mutex_or_rcu_locked() from css_from_id() and
apply it to all css iteration functions and css_from_dir().

v2: cgroup_assert_mutex_or_rcu_locked() definition doesn't need to be
    inside CONFIG_PROVE_RCU ifdef as rcu_lockdep_assert() is always
    defined and conditionalized.  Move it outside of the ifdef block.
