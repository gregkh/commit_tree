ceph: Implement writev/pwritev for sync operation.

For writev/pwritev sync-operatoin, ceph only do the first iov.

I divided the write-sync-operation into two functions. One for
direct-write, other for none-direct-sync-write. This is because for
none-direct-sync-write we can merge iovs to one. But for direct-write,
we can't merge iovs.
