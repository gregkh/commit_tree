RDMA/ocrdma: Populate GID table with IP based gids

This patch is similar in spirit to the "IB/mlx4: Use IBoE (RoCE) IP
based GIDs in the port GID table" patch.

Changes to inet4 and inet6 addresses for the host are monitored and if
the address is associated with an ocrdma device then a gid is added or
deleted from the device's gid table. The gid format will be a IPv4 to
IPv6 mapped or the IPv6 address.
