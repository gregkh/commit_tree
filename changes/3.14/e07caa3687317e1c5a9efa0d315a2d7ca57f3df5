mtd: denali: kill the NAND_MAX_PAGESIZE/NAND_MAX_OOBSIZE

This patch kills the NAND_MAX_PAGESIZE/NAND_MAX_OOBSIZE by the following
way:
 1.) change the @buf field of nand_buf{} from an array to a pointer.
     also remove the DENALI_BUF_SIZE macro.

 2.) Before we call the nand_scan_ident, we allocate a temporary buffer
     whose size is PAGE_SIZE.

 3.) After we finish the nand_scan_ident, we have already getten the
     page size and oob size. We will allocate the right buffer size
     again.
