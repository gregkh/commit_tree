x86, smap: smap_violation() is bogus if CONFIG_X86_SMAP is off

If CONFIG_X86_SMAP is disabled, smap_violation() tests for conditions
which are incorrect (as the AC flag doesn't matter), causing spurious
faults.

The dynamic disabling of SMAP (nosmap on the command line) is fine
because it disables X86_FEATURE_SMAP, therefore causing the
static_cpu_has() to return false.

Found by Fengguang Wu's test system.

[ v3: move all predicates into smap_violation() ]
[ v2: use IS_ENABLED() instead of #ifdef ]
