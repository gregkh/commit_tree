drm/i915: fix gen2-gen3 backlight set

Citing Jani's response to Imre's question in the review discussion:

> According to the gen2/3 bspec I have, the correct mask is
> BACKLIGHT_DUTY_CYCLE_MASK_PNV only in case of IS_PINEVIEW(dev), for
> everything else it's BACKLIGHT_DUTY_CYCLE_MASK.

What you say is correct, but we've treated all gen2/3 similar to PNV
since

    drm/i915: Treat pre-gen4 backlight duty cycle value consistently

i.e. we only use the high 15 bits for all gen2/3. For non-PNV this just
means the lowest bit is always zero. For PNV the lowest bit has a
different meaning in both the PWM freq and duty cycle fields.
