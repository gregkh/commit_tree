batman-adv: fix potential orig_node reference leak

Since batadv_orig_node_new() sets the refcount to two, assuming that
the calling function will use a reference for putting the orig_node into
a hash or similar, both references must be freed if initialization of
the orig_node fails. Otherwise that object may be leaked in that error
case.
