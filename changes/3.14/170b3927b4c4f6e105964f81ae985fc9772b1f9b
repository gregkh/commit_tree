tipc: rename functions related to link failover and improve comments

The functionality related to link addition and failover is unnecessarily
hard to understand and maintain. We try to improve this by renaming
some of the functions, at the same time adding or improving the
explanatory comments around them. Names such as "tipc_rcv()" etc. also
align better with what is used in other networking components.

The changes in this commit are purely cosmetic, no functional changes
are made.
