xen/events: Add the hypervisor interface for the FIFO-based event channels

Add the hypercall sub-ops and the structures for the shared data used
in the FIFO-based event channel ABI.

The design document for this new ABI is available here:

    http://xenbits.xen.org/people/dvrabel/event-channels-H.pdf

In summary, events are reported using a per-domain shared event array
of event words.  Each event word has PENDING, LINKED and MASKED bits
and a LINK field for pointing to the next event in the event queue.

There are 16 event queues (with different priorities) per-VCPU.

Key advantages of this new ABI include:

- Support for over 100,000 events (2^17).
- 16 different event priorities.
- Improved fairness in event latency through the use of FIFOs.

The ABI is available in Xen 4.4 and later.
