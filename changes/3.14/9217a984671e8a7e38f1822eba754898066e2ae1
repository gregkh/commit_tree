ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Use global PCI rescan-remove locking

Multiple race conditions are possible between the ACPI-based PCI hotplug
(ACPIPHP) and the generic PCI bus rescan and device removal that can be
triggered via sysfs.

To avoid those race conditions make the ACPIPHP code use global PCI
rescan-remove locking.
