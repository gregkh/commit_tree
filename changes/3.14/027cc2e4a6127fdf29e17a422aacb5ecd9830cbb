cpufreq: stats: remove hotplug notifiers

Either CPUs are hot-unplugged or suspend/resume occurs, cpufreq core
will send notifications to cpufreq-stats and stats structure and sysfs
entries would be correctly handled..

And so we don't actually need hotcpu notifiers in cpufreq-stats anymore.
We were only handling cpu hot-unplug events here and that are already
taken care of by POLICY notifiers.
