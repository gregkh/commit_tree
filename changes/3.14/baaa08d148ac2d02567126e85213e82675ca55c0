be2net: do not call be_set/get_fw_log_level() on Skyhawk-R

Skyhawk-R FW does not support SET/GET_EXT_FAT_CAPABILITIES cmds via which
FW logging level can be controlled. Also, the hack used in BE3 to control
FW logging level via the ethtool interface is not needed in Skyhawk-R.

This patch also cleans up this code by moving be_set/get_fw_log_level()
routines to be_cmds.c where they belong.
