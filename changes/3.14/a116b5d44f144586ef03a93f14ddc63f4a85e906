thermal: core: introduce thermal_of_cooling_device_register

This patch adds a new API to allow registering cooling devices
in the thermal framework derived from device tree nodes.

This API links the cooling device with the device tree node
so that binding with thermal zones is possible, given
that thermal zones are pointing to cooling device
device tree nodes.
