clk: at91: add PMC programmable clocks

This patch adds new at91 programmable clocks implementation using common clk
framework.
A programmable clock is a clock which can be exported on a given pin to clock
external devices.
Each programmable clock is given an id (from 0 to 8).
The number of available programmable clocks depends on the SoC you're using.
Programmable clock driver only implements the clock setting (clock rate and
parent setting). It must be chained to a system clock in order to
enable/disable the generated clock.
The PCKX pins used to output the clock signals must be assigned to the
appropriate peripheral (see atmel's datasheets).
