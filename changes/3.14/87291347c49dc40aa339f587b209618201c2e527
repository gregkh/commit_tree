tracing: Fix array size mismatch in format string

In event format strings, the array size is reported in two locations.
One in array subscript and then via the "size:" attribute. The values
reported there have a mismatch.

For e.g., in sched:sched_switch the prev_comm and next_comm character
arrays have subscript values as [32] where as the actual field size is
16.

name: sched_switch
ID: 301
format:
        field:unsigned short common_type;       offset:0;       size:2; signed:0;
        field:unsigned char common_flags;       offset:2;       size:1; signed:0;
        field:unsigned char common_preempt_count;       offset:3;       size:1;signed:0;
        field:int common_pid;   offset:4;       size:4; signed:1;

        field:char prev_comm[32];       offset:8;       size:16;        signed:1;
        field:pid_t prev_pid;   offset:24;      size:4; signed:1;
        field:int prev_prio;    offset:28;      size:4; signed:1;
        field:long prev_state;  offset:32;      size:8; signed:1;
        field:char next_comm[32];       offset:40;      size:16;        signed:1;
        field:pid_t next_pid;   offset:56;      size:4; signed:1;
        field:int next_prio;    offset:60;      size:4; signed:1;

After bisection, the following commit was blamed:
92edca0 tracing: Use direct field, type and system names

This commit removes the duplication of strings for field->name and
field->type assuming that all the strings passed in
__trace_define_field() are immutable. This is not true for arrays, where
the type string is created in event_storage variable and field->type for
all array fields points to event_storage.

Use __stringify() to create a string constant for the type string.

Also, get rid of event_storage and event_storage_mutex that are not
needed anymore.

also, an added benefit is that this reduces the overhead of events a bit more:
