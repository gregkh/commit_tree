usb: dwc3: fix the glue drivers using the nop phy

The reset_gpio member of the usb_phy_gen_xceiv_platform_data
structure needs the have negative value or phy-generic's
probe will fail unless DT is used. 0 is a valid gpio number.

This fixes an issue where phy-generic fails to probe with
message: "usb_phy_gen_xceiv.0: Error requesting RESET GPIO 0".
