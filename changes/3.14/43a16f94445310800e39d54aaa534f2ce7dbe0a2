PCI: mvebu: Obey bridge PCI_COMMAND_MEM and PCI_COMMAND_IO bits

When PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY/PCI_COMMAND_IO are cleared, the bridge should not
allocate windows or even look at the window limit/base registers.

Otherwise we may set up bogus windows while the PCI core code performs
discovery.  The core will leave PCI_COMMAND_IO cleared if it doesn't need
an IO window.

Have mvebu_pcie_handle_*_change respect the bits, and call the change
function whenever the bits changes.
