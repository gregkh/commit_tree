x86/efi: Pass necessary EFI data for kexec via setup_data

Add a new setup_data type SETUP_EFI for kexec use.  Passing the saved
fw_vendor, runtime, config tables and EFI runtime mappings.

When entering virtual mode, directly mapping the EFI runtime regions
which we passed in previously. And skip the step to call
SetVirtualAddressMap().

Specially for HP z420 workstation we need save the smbios physical
address.  The kernel boot sequence proceeds in the following order.
Step 2 requires efi.smbios to be the physical address.  However, I found
that on HP z420 EFI system table has a virtual address of SMBIOS in step
1.  Hence, we need set it back to the physical address with the smbios
in efi_setup_data.  (When it is still the physical address, it simply
sets the same value.)

1. efi_init() - Set efi.smbios from EFI system table
2. dmi_scan_machine() - Temporary map efi.smbios to access SMBIOS table
3. efi_enter_virtual_mode() - Map EFI ranges

Tested on ovmf+qemu, lenovo thinkpad, a dell laptop and an
HP z420 workstation.
