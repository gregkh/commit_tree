EDAC, sb_edac: Modify H/W event reporting policy

Newer Intel platforms support more than one method to report H/W event.
On this kind of platform, H/W event report can adopt new method and
traditional EDAC method should be disabled. Moreover, if EDAC event
report method is set to *force*, it means event must be reported via
EDAC interface. IOW, it overrides the default event report policy.
