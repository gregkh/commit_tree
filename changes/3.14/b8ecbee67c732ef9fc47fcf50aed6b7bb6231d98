netfilter: nf_tables: fix log/queue expressions for NFPROTO_INET

The log and queue expressions both store the family during ->init() and
use it to deliver packets. This is wrong when used in NFPROTO_INET since
they should both deliver to the actual AF of the packet, not the dummy
NFPROTO_INET.

Use the family from the hook ops to fix this.
