arm64: add DSB after icache flush in __flush_icache_all()

Add DSB after icache flush to complete the cache maintenance operation.
The function __flush_icache_all() is used only for user space mappings
and an ISB is not required because of an exception return before executing
user instructions. An exception return would behave like an ISB.
