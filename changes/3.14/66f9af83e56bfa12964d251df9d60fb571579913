powerpc/eeh: Disable EEH on reboot

We possiblly detect EEH errors during reboot, particularly in kexec
path, but it's impossible for device drivers and EEH core to handle
or recover them properly.

The patch registers one reboot notifier for EEH and disable EEH
subsystem during reboot. That means the EEH errors is going to be
cleared by hardware reset or second kernel during early stage of
PCI probe.
