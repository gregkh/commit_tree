USB: fix race between hub_disconnect and recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED

There is a race in the hub driver between hub_disconnect() and
recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED().  This race can be triggered if the
driver is unbound from a device at the same time as the bus's root hub
is removed.  When the race occurs, it can cause an oops:

One problem is that recursively_mark_NOTATTACHED() uses the intfdata
value and hub->hdev->maxchild while hub_disconnect() is clearing them.
Another problem is that it uses hub->ports[i] while the port device is
being released.

To fix this race, we need to hold the device_state_lock while
hub_disconnect() changes the values.  (Note that usb_disconnect()
and hub_port_connect_change() already acquire this lock at similar
critical times during a USB device's life cycle.)  We also need to
remove the port devices after maxchild has been set to 0, instead of
before.
