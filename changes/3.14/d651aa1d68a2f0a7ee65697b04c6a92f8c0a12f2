ring-buffer: Fix first commit on sub-buffer having non-zero delta

Each sub-buffer (buffer page) has a full 64 bit timestamp. The events on
that page use a 27 bit delta against that timestamp in order to save on
bits written to the ring buffer. If the time between events is larger than
what the 27 bits can hold, a "time extend" event is added to hold the
entire 64 bit timestamp again and the events after that hold a delta from
that timestamp.

As a "time extend" is always paired with an event, it is logical to just
allocate the event with the time extend, to make things a bit more efficient.

Unfortunately, when the pairing code was written, it removed the "delta = 0"
from the first commit on a page, causing the events on the page to be
slightly skewed.
