PCI: pciehp: Remove error checks when accessing PCIe Capability

There's not much point in checking the return value from every config space
access because the only likely errors are design-time things like unaligned
accesses or invalid register numbers.  The checking clutters the code
significantly, so this patch removes it.

No functional change.
