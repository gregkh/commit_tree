bonding: add netlink attributes to slave link dev

If link is IFF_SLAVE, extend link dev netlink attributes to include
slave attributes with new IFLA_SLAVE nest.  Add netlink notification
(RTM_NEWLINK) when slave status changes from backup to active, or
visa-versa.

Adds new ndo_get_slave op to net_device_ops to fill skb with IFLA_SLAVE
attributes.  Currently only used by bonding driver, but could be
used by other aggregating devices with slaves.
