[media] v4l: omap4iss: Add support for OMAP4 camera interface - Build system

This adds a very simplistic driver to utilize the CSI2A interface inside
the ISS subsystem in OMAP4, and dump the data to memory.
Check Documentation/video4linux/omap4_camera.txt for details.
This commit adds and updates Kconfig's and Makefile's, as well as a TODO
list.
