MIPS: Alchemy: Fix DB1100 GPIO registration

With CONFIG_GPIOLIB=y gpios need to be requested before they can be
modified.  Request the SD carddetect pins, and drop the SPI direction
setup, as the driver does that for us anyway.  This gets rid of a
lot of WARN_ON()s triggered by GPIO core, and restores functionality
of the touschreen controller.
