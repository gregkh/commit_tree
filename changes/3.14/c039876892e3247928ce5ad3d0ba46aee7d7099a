batman-adv: add WiFi penalty

If the same interface is used for sending and receiving, there might be
throughput degradation on half-duplex interfaces such as WiFi. Add a
penalty if the same interface is used to reflect this problem in the
metric. At the same time, change the hop penalty from 30 to 15 so there
will be no change for single wifi mesh network. the effective hop
penalty will stay at 30 due to the new wifi penalty for these networks.
