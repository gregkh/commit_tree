net: Mark functions as static in core/dev.c

this file.

This eliminates the following warning in core/dev.c:
net/core/dev.c:2806:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘__dev_queue_xmit’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
net/core/dev.c:4640:5: warning: no previous prototype for ‘netdev_adjacent_sysfs_add’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
