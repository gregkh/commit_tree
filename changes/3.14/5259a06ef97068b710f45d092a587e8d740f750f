target: Fix percpu_ref_put race in transport_lun_remove_cmd

This patch fixes a percpu_ref_put race for se_lun->lun_ref in
transport_lun_remove_cmd() where ->lun_ref could end up being
put more than once per command via different target completion
and fabric release contexts.

It adds a cmpxchg() for se_cmd->lun_ref_active to ensure that
percpu_ref_put() is only ever called once per se_cmd.

This bug was manifesting itself as a LUN shutdown regression
bug in >= v3.13 code, where percpu_ref_kill() would end up
hanging indefinately due to the incorrect percpu_ref count.

(Change se_cmd->lun_ref_active from bool -> int to force at
 least a 4-byte cmpxchg with MIPS ll/sc ins. - Fengguang)
