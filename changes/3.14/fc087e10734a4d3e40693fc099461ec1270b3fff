xen/events: remove unnecessary init_evtchn_cpu_bindings()

Because the guest-side binding of an event to a VCPU (i.e., setting
the local per-cpu masks) is always explicitly done after an event
channel is bound to a port, there is no need to initialize all
possible events as bound to VCPU 0 at start of day or after a resume.
