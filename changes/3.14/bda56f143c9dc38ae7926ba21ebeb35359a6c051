openvswitch: Use skb_zerocopy() for upcall

Use of skb_zerocopy() can avoid the expensive call to memcpy()
when copying the packet data into the Netlink skb. Completes
checksum through skb_checksum_help() if not already done in
GSO segmentation.

Zerocopy is only performed if user space supported unaligned
Netlink messages. memory mapped netlink i/o is preferred over
zerocopy if it is set up.

Cost of upcall is significantly reduced from:
+   7.48%       vhost-8471  [k] memcpy
+   5.57%     ovs-vswitchd  [k] memcpy
+   2.81%       vhost-8471  [k] csum_partial_copy_generic

to:
+   5.72%     ovs-vswitchd  [k] memcpy
+   3.32%       vhost-5153  [k] memcpy
+   0.68%       vhost-5153  [k] skb_zerocopy
