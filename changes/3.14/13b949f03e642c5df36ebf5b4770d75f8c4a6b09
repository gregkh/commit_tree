serial: 8250_dw: fix compilation warning when !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP

CONFIG_PM will be set if either or both CONFIG_PM_SLEEP and
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is set. Compiling the driver with !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP causes
following compilation warnings:

drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_dw.c:404:12: warning: ‘dw8250_suspend’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_dw.c:413:12: warning: ‘dw8250_resume’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

Fix this by using CONFIG_PM_SLEEP instead.
