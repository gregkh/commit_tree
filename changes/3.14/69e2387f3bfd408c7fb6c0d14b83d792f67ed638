staging: comedi: kcomedilib: protect against device detachment

The functions in "kcomedilib" need to prevent the comedi device being
detached during their operation.  This can be done by acquiring either
the main mutex or the "attach lock" semaphore in the `struct
comedi_device`.  Use the attach lock when merely checking whether the
device is attached.  Use the mutex when processing a comedi instruction.

Also, don't bother trying to manipulate the module use count of
low-level comedi driver in `comedi_open()` and `comedi_close()`.  If the
device gets detached while it is "open", we wouldn't be able to
decrement the module use count anyway.
