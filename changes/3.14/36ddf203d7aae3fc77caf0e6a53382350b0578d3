ath9k: use ether_addr_equal_64bits

Ether_addr_equal_64bits is more efficient than ether_addr_equal, and can be
used when each argument is an array within a structure that contains at
least two bytes of data beyond the array.

The structures involved are:
ieee80211_hdr defined in include/linux/ieee80211.h
ath_common defined in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath.h

This was done using Coccinelle (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/).
