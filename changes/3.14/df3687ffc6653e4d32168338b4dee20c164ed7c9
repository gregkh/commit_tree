ipv6: add the IPV6_FL_F_REFLECT flag to IPV6_FL_A_GET

With this option, the socket will reply with the flow label value read
on received packets.

The goal is to have a connection with the same flow label in both
direction of the communication.

Changelog of V4:
 * Do not erase the flow label on the listening socket. Use pktopts to
 store the received value
