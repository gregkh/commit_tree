[media] lirc_parallel: avoid name conflict on mn10300 arch

The "irq_handler" name is already defined there on a header
file:

/devel/v4l/temp/drivers/staging/media/lirc/lirc_parallel.c:223:13: error: conflicting types for ‘irq_handler’

So, rename it, to avoid namespace conflicts.

This patch fixes building media drivers with allyesconfig/almodconfig on
mn10300 arch.
