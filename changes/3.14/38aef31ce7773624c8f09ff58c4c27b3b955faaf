timekeeping: Remove comment that's mostly out of date

Prior to 92bb1fcf57a0c2e45f7e67fbf0a8ed475a749236 (Only
do nanosecond rounding on GENERIC_TIME_VSYSCALL_OLD
systems), the comment here was accuate, but now we can
mostly avoid the extra rounding which causes the unlikey
to be actually likely here.

So remove the out of date comment.
