zram: remove unnecessary free

Commit a0c516cbfc74 ("zram: don't grab mutex in zram_slot_free_noity")
introduced pending zram slot free in zram's write path in case of
missing slot free by memory allocation failure in zram_slot_free_notify
but it is not necessary because we have already freed the slot right
before overwriting.
