spi/pxa2xx: initialize DMA channels to -1 to prevent inadvertent match

Commit cddb339badb0 (spi/pxa2xx: convert to dma_request_slave_channel_compat())
converted the driver to use ACPI provided DMA helpers but it forgot to
initialize the platform data for the channels to -1. Failing to do so will
result inadvertent match in the filter function because 0 is a valid
channel number.

Prevent this from happening by initializing both platform data channels
correctly to -1.
