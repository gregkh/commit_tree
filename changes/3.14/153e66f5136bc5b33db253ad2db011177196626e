ASoC: axi-{spdif,i2s}: Remove SND_DMAENGINE_PCM_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE flag

The pl330 driver properly reports that it does not have residue reporting
support, which means the PCM dmanegine driver is able to figure this out on its
own. So there is no need to set the flag manually. Removing the flag has the
advantage that once the pl330 driver gains support for residue reporting it will
automatically be used by the generic dmaengine PCM driver.
