usb-storage: restrict bcdDevice range for Super Top in Cypress ATACB

The Cypress ATACB unusual-devs entry for the Super Top SATA bridge
causes problems.  Although it was originally reported only for
bcdDevice = 0x160, its range was much larger.  This resulted in a bug
report for bcdDevice 0x220, so the range was capped at 0x219.  Now
Milan reports errors with bcdDevice 0x150.

Therefore this patch restricts the range to just 0x160.
