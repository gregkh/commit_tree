sfc: Log all unexpected MCDI errors

Split each of efx_mcdi_rpc, efx_mcdi_rpc_finish, and efx_mcdi_rpc_async into
a normal and a _quiet version; made the former log MCDI errors with
netif_err (and include the raw MCDI error code), and the latter never log
them at all.  Changed various callers; any where some errors are expected
(but others are not) call the _quiet version and then if necessary log the
MCDI error themselves.  Said logging is done by new efx_mcdi_display_error.

Callers of efx_mcdi_rpc*_quiet functions which may want to log the error
need to ensure that their outbuf is big enough to hold an MCDI error; to
this end, they now use MCDI_DECLARE_BUF_OUT_OR_ERR, which always allocates
at least 8 bytes.
