btrfs: fix leaks during sysfs teardown

Filipe noticed that we were leaking the features attribute group
after umount. His fix of just calling sysfs_remove_group() wasn't enough
since that removes just the supported features and not the unsupported
features.

This patch changes the unknown feature handling to add them individually
so we can skip the kmalloc and uses the same iteration to tear them down
later.

We also fix the error handling during mount so that we catch the
failing creation of the per-super kobject, and handle proper teardown
of a half-setup sysfs context.

Tested properly with kmemleak enabled this time.
