m68k: Convert arch/m68k/kernel/traps.c to pr_*()

Also fix a few printf-style formats, to get rid of the following compiler
warnings when DEBUG is enabled:

arch/m68k/kernel/traps.c: In function ‘access_error060’:
arch/m68k/kernel/traps.c:166: warning: format ‘%d’ expects type ‘int’, but argument 2 has type ‘long unsigned int’
arch/m68k/kernel/traps.c: In function ‘bus_error030’:
arch/m68k/kernel/traps.c:568: warning: format ‘%#lx’ expects type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 2 has type ‘void *’
arch/m68k/kernel/traps.c:682: warning: format ‘%#lx’ expects type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 2 has type ‘void *’
