Revert "xhci: Avoid infinite loop when sg urb requires too many trbs"

This reverts commit d6c9ea9069af684358efedcaf2f2f687f51c58ee.

We are ripping out commit 35773dac5f862cb1c82ea151eba3e2f6de51ec3e "usb:
xhci: Link TRB must not occur within a USB payload burst" because it's a
hack that caused regressions in the usb-storage and userspace USB
drivers that use usbfs and libusb.  This commit attempted to fix the
issues with that patch.
