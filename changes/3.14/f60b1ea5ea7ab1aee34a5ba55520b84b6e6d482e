CLK: TI: add support for gate clock

This patch adds support for TI specific gate clocks. These behave as basic
gate-clock, but have different ops / hw-ops for controlling the actual
gate, for example waiting until the clock is ready. Several sub-types
are supported:
- ti,gate-clock: basic gate clock with default ops/hwops
- ti,clkdm-gate-clock: clockdomain level gate control
- ti,dss-gate-clock: gate clock with DSS specific hardware handling
- ti,am35xx-gate-clock: gate clock with AM35xx specific hardware handling
- ti,hsdiv-gate-clock: gate clock with OMAP36xx hardware errata handling
