mm: fix bad rss-counter if remap_file_pages raced migration

Fix some "Bad rss-counter state" reports on exit, arising from the
interaction between page migration and remap_file_pages(): zap_pte()
must count a migration entry when zapping it.

And yes, it is possible (though very unusual) to find an anon page or
swap entry in a VM_SHARED nonlinear mapping: coming from that horrid
get_user_pages(write, force) case which COWs even in a shared mapping.
