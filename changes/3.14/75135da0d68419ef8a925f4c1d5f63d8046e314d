i7300_edac: Fix device reference count

pci_get_device() decrements the reference count of "from" (last
argument) so when we break off the loop successfully we have only one
device reference - and we don't know which device we have. If we want
a reference to each device, we must take them explicitly and let
the pci_get_device() walk complete to avoid duplicate references.

This is serious, as over-putting device references will cause
the device to eventually disappear. Without this fix, the kernel
crashes after a few insmod/rmmod cycles.

Tested on an Intel S7000FC4UR system with a 7300 chipset.
