[SCSI] bfa: LUN discovery issue in direct attach mode

In direct attach mode, if port features like QoS/Trunk/FEC/CR are
enabled, driver can receive PLOGI from the target before firmware
notifies lport online to the driver. In case the lport is not yet online
and a PLOGI is received, send a reject to the peer port, instead of
dropping it on the floor.
