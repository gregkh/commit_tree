Drivers: Staging: cxt1e1: use __dev_get_name instead of dev_get_name to find interfaces

The following call chain denotes that both do_reset() and do_del_chan()
are protected under rtnl_lock. If we use __dev_get_by_name() instead of
dev_get_by_name() to find interface handlers in them, this would help
us avoid to change interface reference counter.

dev_ioctl()
  rtnl_lock()
  dev_ifsioc()
    c4_ioctl()
      do_reset()
      do_del_chan()
  rtnl_unlock()
