drm: store the gem vma offset manager in a typed pointer

This was hidden in a generic void * dev->mm_private. But only ever
used for gem. But thanks to this fake generic pretension no one
noticed that Rob's drm drivers are now all broken.

So just give the offset manager a type pointer and fix up msm, omapdrm
and tilcdc.

v2: Fixup compile fail.

v3: Fixup rebase fail that David spotted.
