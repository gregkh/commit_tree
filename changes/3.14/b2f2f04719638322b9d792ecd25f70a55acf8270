[media] vb2: remove the 'fileio = NULL' hack

The read/write implementation in vb2 reuses existing vb2 functions, but
it sets q->fileio to NULL before calling them in order to skip the
'q->fileio != NULL' check.

This works today due to the synchronous nature of read/write, but it
1) is ugly, and 2) will fail in an asynchronous use-case such as a
thread queuing and dequeuing buffers. This last example will be necessary
in order to implement vb2 DVB support.

This patch removes the hack by splitting up the dqbuf/qbuf/streamon/streamoff
functions into an external and an internal version. The external version
checks q->fileio and then calls the internal version. The read/write
implementation now just uses the internal version, removing the need to
set q->fileio to NULL.
