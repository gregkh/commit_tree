sysfs, kernfs: prepare mmap path for kernfs

We're in the process of separating out core sysfs functionality into
kernfs which will deal with sysfs_dirents directly.  This patch
rearranges mmap path so that the kernfs and sysfs parts are separate.

sysfs_kf_bin_mmap() which handles the interaction with bin_attribute
mmap method is factored out of sysfs_bin_mmap(), which is renamed to
kernfs_file_mmap().  All vma ops are renamed accordingly.

sysfs_bin_mmap() is updated such that it can be used for both file
types.  This will eventually allow using the same file_operations for
both file types, which is necessary to separate out kernfs.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.
