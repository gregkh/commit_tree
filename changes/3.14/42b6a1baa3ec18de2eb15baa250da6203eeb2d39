serial_core: Don't re-initialize a previously initialized spinlock.

The uart_set_options() code unconditionally initalizes the spinlock
on the port. This can cause a deadlock in some situations.

One instance that exposed the problem, was when writing to
/sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc to use ttyS0 when the console
is already running on ttyS0. If the spinlock is re-initialized
while the lock is held due to output to the console, there
is a deadlock.

Assume the spinlock is initialized if the port is a console.
