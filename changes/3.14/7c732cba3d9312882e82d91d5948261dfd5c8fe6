powerpc/fsl_booke: protect the access to MAS7

The e500v1 doesn't implement the MAS7, so we should avoid to access
this register on that implementations. In the current kernel, the
access to MAS7 are protected by either CONFIG_PHYS_64BIT or
MMU_FTR_BIG_PHYS. Since some code are executed before the code
patching, we have to use CONFIG_PHYS_64BIT in these cases.
