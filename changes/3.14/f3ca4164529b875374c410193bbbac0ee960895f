ACPI / processor: Rework processor throttling with work_on_cpu()

acpi_processor_set_throttling() uses set_cpus_allowed_ptr() to make
sure that the (struct acpi_processor)->acpi_processor_set_throttling()
callback will run on the right CPU.  However, the function may be
called from a worker thread already bound to a different CPU in which
case that won't work.

Make acpi_processor_set_throttling() use work_on_cpu() as appropriate
instead of abusing set_cpus_allowed_ptr().
