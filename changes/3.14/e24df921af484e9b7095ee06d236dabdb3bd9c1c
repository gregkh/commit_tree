x86, boot: Use .code16 instead of .code16gcc

This reverts commit 28b48688 ("x86, boot: use .code16gcc instead
of .code16").

Versions of binutils older than 2.16 are already not working, so this
workaround is no longer necessary either.  At the same time, some of
the transformations that .code16gcc does can be *extremely*
counterintuitive to a human programmer.

[ hpa: folded ret -> retl and call -> calll fixes from followup patch ]
