driver core: fix device_create() error path

We call put_device() in the error path, which is fine for dev==NULL.
However, in case kobject_set_name_vargs() fails, we have dev!=NULL but
device_initialized() wasn't called, yet.

Fix this by splitting device_register() into explicit calls to
device_add() and an early call to device_initialize().
