ALSA: hda - Add consistent tag names for firmware patch

Some tags used in the firmware patch file are inconsistent with hwdep
sysfs file names, such as, the firmware patch takes [hint] tag while
sysfs file is */hints.  This makes even me referring back to the
document often.  Let's provide the same tag names as sysfs for
reducing confusions.
