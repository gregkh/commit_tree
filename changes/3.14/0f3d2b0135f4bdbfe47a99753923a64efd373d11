ipc: introduce ipc_valid_object() helper to sort out IPC_RMID races

After the locking semantics for the SysV IPC API got improved, a couple
of IPC_RMID race windows were opened because we ended up dropping the
'kern_ipc_perm.deleted' check performed way down in ipc_lock().  The
spotted races got sorted out by re-introducing the old test within the
racy critical sections.

This patch introduces ipc_valid_object() to consolidate the way we cope
with IPC_RMID races by using the same abstraction across the API
implementation.
