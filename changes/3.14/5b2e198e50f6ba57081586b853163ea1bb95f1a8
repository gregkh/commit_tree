powerpc/powernv: Rework EEH reset

When doing reset in order to recover the affected PE, we issue
hot reset on PE primary bus if it's not root bus. Otherwise, we
issue hot or fundamental reset on root port or PHB accordingly.
For the later case, we didn't cover the situation where PE only
includes root port and it potentially causes kernel crash upon
EEH error to the PE.

The patch reworks the logic of EEH reset to improve the code
readability and also avoid the kernel crash.
