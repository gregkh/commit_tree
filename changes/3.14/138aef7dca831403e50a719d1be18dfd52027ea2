netfilter: nf_conntrack_dccp: use %s format string for buffer

Some invocations of nf_log_packet() use arg buffer directly instead of
"%s" format string with follow-up buffer pointer. Currently, these two
usages are not really critical, but we should fix this up nevertheless
so that we don't run into trouble if that changes one day.
