powerpc/eeh: Handle multiple EEH errors

For one PCI error relevant OPAL event, we possibly have multiple
EEH errors for that. For example, multiple frozen PEs detected on
different PHBs. Unfortunately, we didn't cover the case. The patch
enumarates the return value from eeh_ops::next_error() and change
eeh_handle_special_event() and eeh_ops::next_error() to handle all
existing EEH errors.

As Ben pointed out, we needn't list_for_each_entry_safe() since we
are not deleting any PHB from the hose_list and the EEH serialized
lock should be held while purging EEH events. The patch covers those
suggestions as well.
