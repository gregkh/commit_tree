powerpc/powernv: Remove unnecessary assignment

We don't have IO ports on PHB3 and the assignment of variable
"iomap_off" on PHB3 is meaningless. The patch just removes the
unnecessary assignment to the variable. The code change should
have been part of commit c35d2a8c ("powerpc/powernv: Needn't IO
segment map for PHB3").
