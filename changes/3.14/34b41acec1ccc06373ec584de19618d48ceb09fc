Btrfs: use a bit to track if we're in the radix tree

For creating a dummy in-memory btree I need to be able to use the radix tree to
keep track of the buffers like normal extent buffers.  With dummy buffers we
skip the radix tree step, and we still want to do that for the tree mod log
dummy buffers but for my test buffers we need to be able to remove them from the
radix tree like normal.  This will give me a way to do that.  Thanks,
