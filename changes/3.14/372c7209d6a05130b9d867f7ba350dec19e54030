microblaze: extable: sort the exception table at build time

Sort the exception table at build-time rather than during boot.

Microblaze is the same case as AARCH64 that's why EM_MICROBLAZE
conditional check was added to allow cross-compilation on machines which
are not running the latest libc-dev.

Inspired by AARCH64 commit adace89562c7 ("arm64: extable: sort the
exception table at build time").
