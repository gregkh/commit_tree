sched: add tracepoints related to NUMA task migration

This patch adds three tracepoints
 o trace_sched_move_numa	when a task is moved to a node
 o trace_sched_swap_numa	when a task is swapped with another task
 o trace_sched_stick_numa	when a numa-related migration fails

The tracepoints allow the NUMA scheduler activity to be monitored and the
following high-level metrics can be calculated

 o NUMA migrated stuck	 nr trace_sched_stick_numa
 o NUMA migrated idle	 nr trace_sched_move_numa
 o NUMA migrated swapped nr trace_sched_swap_numa
 o NUMA local swapped	 trace_sched_swap_numa src_nid == dst_nid (should never happen)
 o NUMA remote swapped	 trace_sched_swap_numa src_nid != dst_nid (should == NUMA migrated swapped)
 o NUMA group swapped	 trace_sched_swap_numa src_ngid == dst_ngid
			 Maybe a small number of these are acceptable
			 but a high number would be a major surprise.
			 It would be even worse if bounces are frequent.
 o NUMA avg task migs.	 Average number of migrations for tasks
 o NUMA stddev task mig	 Self-explanatory
 o NUMA max task migs.	 Maximum number of migrations for a single task

In general the intent of the tracepoints is to help diagnose problems
where automatic NUMA balancing appears to be doing an excessive amount
of useless work.
