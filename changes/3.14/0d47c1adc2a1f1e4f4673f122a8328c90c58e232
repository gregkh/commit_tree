f2fs: convert max_orphans to a field of f2fs_sb_info

Previously, we need to calculate the max orphan num when we try to acquire an
orphan inode, but it's a stable value since the super block was inited. So
converting it to a field of f2fs_sb_info and use it directly when needed seems
a better choose.
