tipc: remove all enabled flags from all tipc components

When tipc module is inserted, many tipc components are initialized
one by one. During the initialization period, if one of them is
failed, tipc_core_stop() will be called to stop all components
whatever corresponding components are created or not. To avoid to
release uncreated ones, relevant components have to add necessary
enabled flags indicating whether they are created or not.

But in the initialization stage, if one component is unsuccessfully
created, we will just destroy successfully created components before
the failed component instead of all components. All enabled flags
defined in components, in turn, become redundant. Additionally it's
also unnecessary to identify whether table.types is NULL in
tipc_nametbl_stop() because name stable has been definitely created
successfully when tipc_nametbl_stop() is called.
