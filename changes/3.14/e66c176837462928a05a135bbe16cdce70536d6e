intel_pstate: Change busy calculation to use fixed point math.

Commit fcb6a15c2e (intel_pstate: Take core C0 time into account for
core busy calculation) introduced a regression on some processor SKUs
supported by intel_pstate. This was due to the truncation caused by
using integer math to calculate core busy and C0 percentages.

On a i7-4770K processor operating at 800Mhz going to 100% utilization
the percent busy of the CPU using integer math is 22%, but it actually
is 22.85%.  This value scaled to the current frequency returned 97
which the PID interpreted as no error and did not adjust the P state.

Tested on i7-4770K, i7-2600, i5-3230M.
