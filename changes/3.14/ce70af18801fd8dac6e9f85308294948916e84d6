irq-renesas-irqc: simplify irq_set_type() method

Value 0 of the sense  selection field of CONFIG_n register means "disable event
detection" and serves in irqc_sense[] for marking the invalid values of the IRQ
type (by just omitting initializers). There is no need for INTC_IRQ_SENSE_VALID
and hence INTC_IRQ_SENSE() as all field values matching to the  valid IRQ types
are non-zero anyway.
