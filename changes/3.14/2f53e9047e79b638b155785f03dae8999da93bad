phy: coding style fixes

The recent patch from Florian Fainelli fixed all 'checkpatch.pl' errors but left
the numerous warnings:

- including <asm/io.h> instead of <linux/io.h>;

- including <asm/uaccess.h> instead of <linux/uaccess.h>;

- *extern* declaration in .c file;

- block comments using empty /* line;

- block comments not starting with * on the middle lines;

- block comments not having trailing */ on a separate line;

- EXPORT_SYMBOL() not immediately following its function;

- unnecessary {} for signle statement block;

- spaces before tabs.

While fixing these, also fix the following style issues (some of which were
found running 'checkpatch.pl --strict'):

- alignment not matching open paren;

- missing {} on one of the *if* arms where another has them;

- use of sizeof(struct structure) instead of sizeof(*variable);

- multiple assignments on one line;

- empty line before };

- file names in the heading comments;

- missing spaces around operators;

- no {} around multi-line *if* operator's arm;

- unneeded () around subexpressions;

- incomplete kernel-doc comment style;

- comment line exceeding 80 characters;

- missing empty line after declarations.
