cgroup: unify cgroup_write_X64() and cgroup_write_string()

cgroup_write_X64() and cgroup_write_string() both implement about the
same buffering logic.  Unify the two into cgroup_file_write() which
always allocates dynamic buffer for simplicity and uses kstrto*()
instead of simple_strto*().

This patch doesn't make any visible behavior changes except for
possibly different error value from kstrsto*().
