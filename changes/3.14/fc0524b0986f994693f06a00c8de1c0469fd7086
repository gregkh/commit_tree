staging/olpc_docn: reorder the lock sequence to avoid potential dead lock

The lock sequence of dcon_blank_fb(fb_info->lock ---> console_lock) is against
with the one of console_callback(console_lock ---> fb_info->lock), it'll
lead to a potential dead lock, so reorder the lock sequence of dcon_blank_fb
to avoid the potential dead lock.
