crypto: ahash - Fully restore ahash request before completing

When finishing the ahash request, the ahash_op_unaligned_done() will
call complete() on the request. Yet, this will not call the correct
complete callback. The correct complete callback was previously stored
in the requests' private data, as seen in ahash_op_unaligned(). This
patch restores the correct complete callback and .data field of the
request before calling complete() on it.
