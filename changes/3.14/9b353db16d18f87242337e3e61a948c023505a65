zram: delay pending free request in read path

Sergey reported we don't need to handle pending free request every I/O
so that this patch removes it in read path while we remain it in write
path.

Let's consider below example.

Swap subsystem ask to zram "A" block free by swap_slot_free_notify but
zram had been pended it without real freeing.  Swap subsystem allocates
"A" block for new data but request pended for a long time just handled
and zram blindly free new data on the "A" block.  :(

That's why we couldn't remove handle pending free request right before
zram-write.
