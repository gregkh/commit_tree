ASoC: dmaengine: support deferred probe for DMA channels

Enhance dmaengine_pcm_request_chan_of() to support deferred probe for
DMA channels, by using the new dma_request_slave_channel_or_err() API.
This prevents snd_dmaengine_pcm_register() from succeeding without
acquiring DMA channels due to the relevant DMA controller not yet being
registered.
