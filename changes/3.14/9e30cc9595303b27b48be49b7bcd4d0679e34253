sysfs, kernfs: no need to kern_mount() sysfs from sysfs_init()

It has been very long since sysfs depended on vfs to keep track of
internal states and whether sysfs is mounted or not doesn't make any
difference to sysfs's internal operation.

In addition to init and filesystem type registration, sysfs_init()
invokes kern_mount() to create in-kernel mount of sysfs.  This
internal mounting doesn't server any purpose anymore.  Remove it.
