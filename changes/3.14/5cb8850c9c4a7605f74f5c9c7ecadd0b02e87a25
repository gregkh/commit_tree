block: Explicitly handle discard/write same segments

Immutable biovecs changed the way biovecs are interpreted - drivers no
longer use bi_vcnt, they have to go by bi_iter.bi_size (to allow for
using part of an existing segment without modifying it).

This breaks with discards and write_same bios, since for those bi_size
has nothing to do with segments in the biovec. So for now, we need a
fairly gross hack - we fortunately know that there will never be more
than one segment for the entire request, so we can special case
discard/write_same.
