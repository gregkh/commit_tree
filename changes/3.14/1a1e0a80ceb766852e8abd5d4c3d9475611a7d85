sound: oss: dmasound: kill SLEEP() macro to avoid race

The use of interruptible_sleep_on_timeout in the dmasound driver
is questionable and we want to kill off all sleep_on variants.
This replaces the calls with wait_event_interruptible_timeout
where possible, to wait for a particular event instead of blocking
in a racy way. In the sq_write function, the easiest solution is
an open-coded prepare_to_wait loop.
