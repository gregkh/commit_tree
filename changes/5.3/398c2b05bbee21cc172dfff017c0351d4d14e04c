linux/dim: Add completions count to dim_sample

Added a measurement of completions per/msec to allow for completion based
dim algorithms.

In order to use dynamic interrupt moderation with RDMA we need to have a
different measurment than packets per second. This change is meant to
prepare for adding a new DIM method.

All drivers that use net_dim and thus do not need a completion count will
have the completions set to 0.
