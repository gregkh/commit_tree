scsi: zfcp: fix request object use-after-free in send path causing wrong traces

When tracing instances where we open and close WKA ports, we also pass the
request-ID of the respective FSF command.

But after successfully sending the FSF command we must not use the
request-object anymore, as this might result in an use-after-free (see
"zfcp: fix request object use-after-free in send path causing seqno
errors" ).

To fix this add a new variable that caches the request-ID before sending
the request. This won't change during the hand-off to the FCP channel,
and so it's safe to trace this cached request-ID later, instead of using
the request object.
