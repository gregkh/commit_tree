x86/speculation/mds: Apply more accurate check on hypervisor platform

X86_HYPER_NATIVE isn't accurate for checking if running on native platform,
e.g. CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST isn't set or "nopv" is enabled.

Checking the CPU feature bit X86_FEATURE_HYPERVISOR to determine if it's
running on native platform is more accurate.

This still doesn't cover the platforms on which X86_FEATURE_HYPERVISOR is
unsupported, e.g. VMware, but there is nothing which can be done about this
scenario.
