dt-bindings: arm: renesas: Add HopeRun RZ/G2[M] boards

This patch adds board HiHope RZ/G2M (the main board, powered by
the R8A774A1) and board HiHope RZ/G2 EX (the expansion board
that sits on top of the HiHope RZ/G2M). Both boards are made
by Jiangsu HopeRun Software Co., Ltd. (a.k.a. HopeRun).

We already know that the HiHope RZ/G2 EX will also sit on the
HiHope RZ/G2N, even though the HiHope RZ/G2N doesn't exist just
yet.
