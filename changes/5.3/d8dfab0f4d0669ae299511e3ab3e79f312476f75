soc: imx: soc-imx8: Avoid unnecessary of_node_put() in error handling

of_node_put() is called after of_match_node() successfully called,
then in the following error handling, of_node_put() is called again
which is unnecessary, this patch adjusts the location of of_node_put()
to avoid such scenario.
