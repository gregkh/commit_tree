net: ethernet: ti: davinci_cpdma: allow desc split while down

That's possible to set ring params while interfaces are down. When
interface gets up it uses number of descs to fill rx queue and on
later on changes to create rx pools. Usually, this resplit can happen
after phy is up, but it can be needed before this, so allow it to
happen while setting number of rx descs, when interfaces are down.
Also, if no dependency on intf state, move it to cpdma layer, where
it should be.
