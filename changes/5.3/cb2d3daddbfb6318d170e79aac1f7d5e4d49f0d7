Btrfs: fix race leading to fs corruption after transaction abort

When one transaction is finishing its commit, it is possible for another
transaction to start and enter its initial commit phase as well. If the
first ends up getting aborted, we have a small time window where the second
transaction commit does not notice that the previous transaction aborted
and ends up committing, writing a superblock that points to btrees that
reference extent buffers (nodes and leafs) that were not persisted to disk.
The consequence is that after mounting the filesystem again, we will be
unable to load some btree nodes/leafs, either because the content on disk
is either garbage (or just zeroes) or corresponds to the old content of a
previouly COWed or deleted node/leaf, resulting in the well known error
messages "parent transid verify failed on ...".
The following sequence diagram illustrates how this can happen.

                                                               disk that points to trees
                                                               that refer to at least one
                                                               extent buffer that was
                                                               never persisted

So fix this by updating the transaction commit path to check if the flag
BTRFS_FS_STATE_TRANS_ABORTED is set on fs_info->fs_state if after setting
the transaction to the TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START we do not find any previous
transaction in the fs_info->trans_list. If the flag is set, just fail the
transaction commit with -EROFS, as we do in other places. The exact error
code for the previous transaction abort was already logged and reported.
