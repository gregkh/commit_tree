drm/fourcc: Fix the parameters name in the documentation

We introduced new functions in the commit bf39607c1614 ("drm/fourcc: Pass
the format_info pointer to drm_format_plane_width/height") based on
previous ones but with a slightly different prototype. However, the
documentation wasn't changed to reflect that change.
