mm/hmm: Remove duplicate condition test before wait_event_timeout

The wait_event_timeout macro already tests the condition as its first
action, so there is no reason to open code another version of this, all
that does is skip the might_sleep() debugging in common cases, which is
not helpful.

Further, based on prior patches, we can now simplify the required condition
test:
 - If range is valid memory then so is range->hmm
 - If hmm_release() has run then range->valid is set to false
   at the same time as dead, so no reason to check both.
 - A valid hmm has a valid hmm->mm.

Allowing the return value of wait_event_timeout() (along with its internal
barriers) to compute the result of the function.
