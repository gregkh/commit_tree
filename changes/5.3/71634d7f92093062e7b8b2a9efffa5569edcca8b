bpf: Add support for fq's EDT to HBM

Adds support for fq's Earliest Departure Time to HBM (Host Bandwidth
Manager). Includes a new BPF program supporting EDT, and also updates
corresponding programs.

It will drop packets with an EDT of more than 500us in the future
unless the packet belongs to a flow with less than 2 packets in flight.
This is done so each flow has at least 2 packets in flight, so they
will not starve, and also to help prevent delayed ACK timeouts.

It will also work with ECN enabled traffic, where the packets will be
CE marked if their EDT is more than 50us in the future.

The table below shows some performance numbers. The flows are back to
back RPCS. One server sending to another, either 2 or 4 flows.
One flow is a 10KB RPC, the rest are 1MB RPCs. When there are more
than one flow of a given RPC size, the numbers represent averages.

The rate limit applies to all flows (they are in the same cgroup).
Tests ending with "-edt" ran with the new BPF program supporting EDT.
Tests ending with "-hbt" ran on top HBT qdisc with the specified rate
(i.e. no HBM). The other tests ran with the HBM BPF program included
in the HBM patch-set.

EDT has limited value when using DCTCP, but it helps in many cases when
using Cubic. It usually achieves larger link utilization and lower
99% latencies for the 1MB RPCs.
HBM ends up queueing a lot of packets with its default parameter values,
reducing the goodput of the 10KB RPCs and increasing their latency. Also,
the RTTs seen by the flows are quite large.
