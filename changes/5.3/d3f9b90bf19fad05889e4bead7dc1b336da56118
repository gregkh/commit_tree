net: dsa: sja1105: Build a minimal understanding of meta frames

Meta frames are sent on the CPU port by the switch if RX timestamping is
enabled. They contain a partial timestamp of the previous frame.

They are Ethernet frames with the Ethernet header constructed out of:

- SJA1105_META_DMAC
- SJA1105_META_SMAC
- ETH_P_SJA1105_META

The Ethernet payload will be decoded in a follow-up patch.
