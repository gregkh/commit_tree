dma-direct: handle DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING in common code

DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING is generally implemented by allocating
normal cacheable pages or CMA memory, and then returning the page
pointer as the opaque handle.  Lift that code from the xtensa and
generic dma remapping implementations into the generic dma-direct
code so that we don't even call arch_dma_alloc for these allocations.
