ACPICA: Namespace: simplify creation of the initial/default namespace

ACPICA commit 76658f55d8cc498a763bdb92f8e0d934822a129c

For the objects that are created by default (_GPE, _SB_, etc)
there is no need to use the heavyweight ns_lookup function.
Instead, simply create each object and link it in as the namespace
is built.
