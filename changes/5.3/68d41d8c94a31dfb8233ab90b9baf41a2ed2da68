locking/lockdep: Fix lock used or unused stats error

The stats variable nr_unused_locks is incremented every time a new lock
class is register and decremented when the lock is first used in
__lock_acquire(). And after all, it is shown and checked in lockdep_stats.

However, under configurations that either CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS or
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is not defined:

The commit:

  091806515124b20 ("locking/lockdep: Consolidate lock usage bit initialization")

missed marking the LOCK_USED flag at IRQ usage initialization because
as mark_usage() is not called. And the commit:

  886532aee3cd42d ("locking/lockdep: Move mark_lock() inside CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS && CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING")

further made mark_lock() not defined such that the LOCK_USED cannot be
marked at all when the lock is first acquired.

As a result, we fix this by not showing and checking the stats under such
configurations for lockdep_stats.
