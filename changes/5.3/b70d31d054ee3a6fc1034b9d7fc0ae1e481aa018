libnvdimm/bus: Stop holding nvdimm_bus_list_mutex over __nd_ioctl()

In preparation for fixing a deadlock between wait_for_bus_probe_idle()
and the nvdimm_bus_list_mutex arrange for __nd_ioctl() without
nvdimm_bus_list_mutex held. This also unifies the 'dimm' and 'bus' level
ioctls into a common nd_ioctl() preamble implementation.

Marked for -stable as it is a pre-requisite for a follow-on fix.
