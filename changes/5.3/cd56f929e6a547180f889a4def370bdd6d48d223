net/mlx5: E-Switch, Replace host_params event with functions_changed event

To support sriov on a E-Switch manager, num_vfs are queried
to the firmware whenever E-Switch manager is notified by
esw_functions_changed event.

Replace host_params event with esw_functions_changed event that reflects
more appropriate naming.

While at it, also correct num_vfs type from int to u16 as expected by
the function mlx5_esw_query_functions().
