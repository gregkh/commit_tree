mwifiex: print PCI mmap with %pK

Unadorned '%p' has restrictive policies these days, such that it usually
just prints garbage at early boot (see
Documentation/core-api/printk-formats.rst, "kernel will print
``(ptrval)`` until it gathers enough entropy"). Annotating with %pK
(for "kernel pointer") allows the kptr_restrict sysctl to control
printing policy better.

We might just as well drop this message entirely, but this fix was easy
enough for now.
