KVM: X86: Emulate MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE MWAIT bit

MSR IA32_MISC_ENABLE bit 18, according to SDM:

| When this bit is set to 0, the MONITOR feature flag is not set (CPUID.01H:ECX[bit 3] = 0).
| This indicates that MONITOR/MWAIT are not supported.
|
| Software attempts to execute MONITOR/MWAIT will cause #UD when this bit is 0.
|
| When this bit is set to 1 (default), MONITOR/MWAIT are supported (CPUID.01H:ECX[bit 3] = 1).

The CPUID.01H:ECX[bit 3] ought to mirror the value of the MSR bit,
CPUID.01H:ECX[bit 3] is a better guard than kvm_mwait_in_guest().
kvm_mwait_in_guest() affects the behavior of MONITOR/MWAIT, not its
guest visibility.

This patch implements toggling of the CPUID bit based on guest writes
to the MSR.
