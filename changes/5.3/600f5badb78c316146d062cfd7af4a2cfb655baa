cpufreq: schedutil: Don't skip freq update when limits change

To avoid reducing the frequency of a CPU prematurely, we skip reducing
the frequency if the CPU had been busy recently.

This should not be done when the limits of the policy are changed, for
example due to thermal throttling. We should always get the frequency
within the new limits as soon as possible.

Trying to fix this by using only one flag, i.e. need_freq_update, can
lead to a race condition where the flag gets cleared without forcing us
to change the frequency at least once. And so this patch introduces
another flag to avoid that race condition.
