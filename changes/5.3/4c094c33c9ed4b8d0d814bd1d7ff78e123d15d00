btrfs: tree-checker: Check if the file extent end overflows

Under certain conditions, we could have strange file extent item in log
tree like:

  item 18 key (69599 108 397312) itemoff 15208 itemsize 53
	extent data disk bytenr 0 nr 0
	extent data offset 0 nr 18446744073709547520 ram 18446744073709547520

The num_bytes + ram_bytes overflow 64 bit type.

For num_bytes part, we can detect such overflow along with file offset
(key->offset), as file_offset + num_bytes should never go beyond u64.

For ram_bytes part, it's about the decompressed size of the extent, not
directly related to the size.
In theory it is OK to have a large value, and put extra limitation
on RAM bytes may cause unexpected false alerts.

So in tree-checker, we only check if the file offset and num bytes
overflow.
