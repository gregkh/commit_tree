drm/ttm: Allow the driver to provide the ttm struct vm_operations_struct

Add a pointer to the struct vm_operations_struct in the bo_device, and
assign that pointer to the default value currently used.

The driver can then optionally modify that pointer and the new value
can be used for each new vma created.
