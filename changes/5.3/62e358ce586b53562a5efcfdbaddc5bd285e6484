vfio: ap: register IOMMU VFIO notifier

To be able to use the VFIO interface to facilitate the
mediated device memory pinning/unpinning we need to register
a notifier for IOMMU.

While we will start to pin one guest page for the interrupt indicator
byte, this is still ok with ballooning as this page will never be
used by the guest virtio-balloon driver.
So the pinned page will never be freed. And even a broken guest does
so, that would not impact the host as the original page is still
in control by vfio.
