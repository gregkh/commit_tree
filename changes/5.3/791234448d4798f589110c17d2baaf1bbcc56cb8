nfsd: decode implementation id

Decode the implementation ID and display in nfsd/clients/#/info.  It may
be help identify the client.  It won't be used otherwise.

(When this went into the protocol, I thought the implementation ID would
be a slippery slope towards implementation-specific workarounds as with
the http user-agent.  But I guess I was wrong, the risk seems pretty low
now.)
