net/mlx5e: Fix error flow of CQE recovery on tx reporter

CQE recovery function begins with test and set of recovery bit. Add an
error flow which ensures clearing of this bit when leaving the recovery
function, to allow further recoveries to take place. This allows removal
of clearing recovery bit on sq activate.
