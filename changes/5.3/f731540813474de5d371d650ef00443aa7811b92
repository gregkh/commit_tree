staging: kpc2000: use IDA to assign card numbers.

Previously the next card number was assigned from a static int local
variable.  Replaced it with an IDA.  Avoids the assignment of ever-
increasing card-numbers by allowing them to be reused.

Updated TODO.

Corrected format-specifier for unsigned pcard->card_num.
