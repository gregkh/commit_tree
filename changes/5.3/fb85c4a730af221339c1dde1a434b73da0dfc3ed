bpf: export bpf_sock for BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR prog type

And let it use bpf_sk_storage_{get,delete} helpers to access socket
storage. Kernel context (struct bpf_sock_addr_kern) already has sk
member, so I just expose it to the BPF hooks. Using PTR_TO_SOCKET
instead of PTR_TO_SOCK_COMMON should be safe because the hook is
called on bind/connect.
