udp: Remove unused parameter (exact_dif)

Originally this was used by the VRF logic in compute_score(), but that
was later replaced by udp_sk_bound_dev_eq() and the parameter became
unused.

Note this change adds an 'unused variable' compiler warning that will be
removed in the next patch (I've split the removal in two to make review
slightly easier).
