KVM: nVMX: Don't speculatively write APIC-access page address

If nested_get_vmcs12_pages() fails to map L1's APIC_ACCESS_ADDR into
L2, then it disables SECONDARY_EXEC_VIRTUALIZE_APIC_ACCESSES in vmcs02.
In other words, the APIC_ACCESS_ADDR in vmcs02 is guaranteed to be
written with the correct value before being consumed by hardware, drop
the unneessary VMWRITE.
