ipv4: mpls: fix mpls_xmit for iptunnel

When using mpls over gre/gre6 setup, rt->rt_gw4 address is not set, the
same for rt->rt_gw_family.  Therefore, when rt->rt_gw_family is checked
in mpls_xmit(), neigh_xmit() call is skipped. As a result, such setup
doesn't work anymore.

This issue was found with LTP mpls03 tests.
