x86/uaccess: Don't leak AC flag into fentry from mcsafe_handle_tail()

After adding mcsafe_handle_tail() to the objtool uaccess safe list,
objtool reports:

  arch/x86/lib/usercopy_64.o: warning: objtool: mcsafe_handle_tail()+0x0: call to __fentry__() with UACCESS enabled

With SMAP, this function is called with AC=1, so it needs to be careful
about which functions it calls.  Disable the ftrace entry hook, which
can potentially pull in a lot of extra code.
