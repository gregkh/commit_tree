drm/amd/powerplay: enable fw ctf,apcc dfll and gfx ss

enable fw ctf, apcc dfll and gfx ss on navi10.
fw ctf: when the fw ctf is triggered, the gfx and soc power domain
are shut down. fan speed is boosted to the maximum.
gfx ss: hardware feature, sanity check has been done.
apcc dfll: can check the scoreboard in smu fw to confirm if it's enabled.
no need to do further check since the gfx hardware control the frequency once
a pcc signal comes.
