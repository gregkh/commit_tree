lib/test_meminit.c: minor test fixes

Fix the following issues in test_meminit.c:
 - |size| in fill_with_garbage_skip() should be signed so that it
   doesn't overflow if it's not aligned on sizeof(*p);
 - fill_with_garbage_skip() should actually skip |skip| bytes;
 - do_kmem_cache_size() should deallocate memory in the RCU case.
