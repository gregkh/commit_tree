net/mlx4_en: fix a memory leak bug

In mlx4_en_config_rss_steer(), 'rss_map->indir_qp' is allocated through
kzalloc(). After that, mlx4_qp_alloc() is invoked to configure RSS
indirection. However, if mlx4_qp_alloc() fails, the allocated
'rss_map->indir_qp' is not deallocated, leading to a memory leak bug.

To fix the above issue, add the 'qp_alloc_err' label to free
'rss_map->indir_qp'.
