block, bfq: update base request service times when possible

I/O injection gets reduced if it increases the request service times
of the victim queue beyond a certain threshold.  The threshold, in its
turn, is computed as a function of the base service time enjoyed by
the queue when it undergoes no injection.

As a consequence, for injection to work properly, the above base value
has to be accurate. In this respect, such a value may vary over
time. For example, it varies if the size or the spatial locality of
the I/O requests in the queue change. It is then important to update
this value whenever possible. This commit performs this update.
