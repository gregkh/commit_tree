net: dsa: microchip: Support optional 125MHz SYNCLKO output

The KSZ9477 series chips have a SYNCLKO pin which by default outputs a
25MHz clock, but some board setups require a 125MHz clock instead. Added
a microchip,synclko-125 device tree property to allow indicating a
125MHz clock output is required.
