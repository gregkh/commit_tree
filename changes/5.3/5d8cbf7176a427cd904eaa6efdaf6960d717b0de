docs: extcon: convert it to ReST and move to ACPI dir

The intel-int3496.txt file is a documentation for an ACPI driver.

There's no reason to keep it on a separate directory.

So, instead of keeping it on some random location, move it
to a sub-directory inside the ACPI documentation dir,
renaming it to .rst.
