iommu/amd: Make iommu_disable safer

Make it safe to call iommu_disable during early init error conditions
before mmio_base is set, but after the struct amd_iommu has been added
to the amd_iommu_list. For example, this happens if firmware fails to
fill in mmio_phys in the ACPI table leading to a NULL pointer
dereference in iommu_feature_disable.
