net/mlx5e: Fix unused variable warning when CONFIG_MLX5_ESWITCH is off

In mlx5e_setup_tc "priv" variable is not being used if
CONFIG_MLX5_ESWITCH is off, one way to fix this is to actually use it.

mlx5e_setup_tc_mqprio also needs the "priv" variable and it extracts it
on its own. We can simply pass priv to mlx5e_setup_tc_mqprio instead of
netdev and avoid extracting the priv var, which will also resolve the
compiler warning.
