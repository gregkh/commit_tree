drm/msm/a6xx: Remove duplicate irq disable from remove

a6xx_gmu_stop() already calls this function via shutdown or force_stop,
so it's not necessary to call it twice. Previously this would have
knocked the irq refcount out of sync, but now with the irqs_enabled flag
it's just housekeeping.

Changes in v2:
- None
