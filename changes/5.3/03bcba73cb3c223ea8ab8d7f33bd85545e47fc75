MIPS: perf events: handle switch statement falling through warnings

Now that we build with -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3, some warnings are
produced in the arch/mips perf events code that are promoted to errors:

 arch/mips/kernel/perf_event_mipsxx.c:792:3: error: this statement may fall through [-Werror=implicit-fallthrough=]
 arch/mips/kernel/perf_event_mipsxx.c:795:3: error: this statement may fall through [-Werror=implicit-fallthrough=]
 arch/mips/kernel/perf_event_mipsxx.c:798:3: error: this statement may fall through [-Werror=implicit-fallthrough=]
 arch/mips/kernel/perf_event_mipsxx.c:1407:6: error: this statement may fall through [-Werror=implicit-fallthrough=]

Assume the fall throughs are deliberate amd annotate/eliminate them.

  - Make n signed to fix the loop condition.
  - Simplify the initialization of n, which should never have a value
    greater than 4.
  - Invert conditions in the loop to decrease indentation.]
