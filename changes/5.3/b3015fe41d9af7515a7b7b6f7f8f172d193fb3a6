tracing: Make a separate config for trace event self tests

The trace event self tests enable loop through *all* events, enables each
one, one at a time, runs some code to trigger various events (not
necessarily the same events), and checks if anything went wrong. The issue
is that trace events are usually the least likely start up test to cause a
problem, but they take the longest to run (because there are so many
events). When one of the other tests trigger a bug, the trace event start up
tests causes the bisect to take much longer, because it takes 10s of seconds
to get through the trace event tests.

By making them a separate config (even though they are enabled by default if
start up tests are set), it is possible to turn them off and still run the
other tracing start up tests much quicker.
