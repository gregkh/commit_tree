compat_ioctl: pppoe: fix PPPOEIOCSFWD handling

Support for handling the PPPOEIOCSFWD ioctl in compat mode was added in
linux-2.5.69 along with hundreds of other commands, but was always broken
sincen only the structure is compatible, but the command number is not,
due to the size being sizeof(size_t), or at first sizeof(sizeof((struct
sockaddr_pppox)), which is different on 64-bit architectures.

Guillaume Nault adds:

  And the implementation was broken until 2016 (see 29e73269aa4d ("pppoe:
  fix reference counting in PPPoE proxy")), and nobody ever noticed. I
  should probably have removed this ioctl entirely instead of fixing it.
  Clearly, it has never been used.

Fix it by adding a compat_ioctl handler for all pppoe variants that
translates the command number and then calls the regular ioctl function.

All other ioctl commands handled by pppoe are compatible between 32-bit
and 64-bit, and require compat_ptr() conversion.

This should apply to all stable kernels.
