taprio: Fix kernel panic in taprio_destroy

taprio_init may fail earlier than this line:

	list_add(&q->taprio_list, &taprio_list);

i.e. due to the net device not being multi queue.

Attempting to remove q from the global taprio_list when it is not part
of it will result in a kernel panic.

Fix it by matching list_add and list_del better to one another in the
order of operations. This way we can keep the deletion unconditional
and with lower complexity - O(1).
