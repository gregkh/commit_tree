Bluetooth: hci_ldisc: Add function to wait for characters to be sent

The hci UART line discipline sends its characters in a workqueue. Some
devices like the Marvell Bluetooth chips need to make sure that all
queued characters are sent before switching the baudrate. This adds
a function to synchronize with the workqueue.
