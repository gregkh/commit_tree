perf hists: Add block_info in hist_entry

The block_info contains the program basic block information, i.e,
contains the start address and the end address of this basic block and
how much cycles it takes.

We need to compare, sort and even print out the basic block by some
orders, i.e. sort by cycles.

For this purpose, we add block_info field to hist_entry. In order not to
impact current interface, we creates a new function
hists__add_entry_block.

 v6:

 Remove the 'ops' argument in hists__add_entry_block
