drm/bridge: tc358767: cleanup LT result check

The driver has a loop after ending link training, where it reads the
DPCD link status and prints an error if that status is not ok.

The loop is unnecessary, as far as I can understand from DP specs, so
let's remove it. We can also print the more specific errors to help
debugging.
