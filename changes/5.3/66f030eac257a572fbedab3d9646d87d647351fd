firmware: ti_sci: Always request response from firmware

TI-SCI firmware will only respond to messages when the
TI_SCI_FLAG_REQ_ACK_ON_PROCESSED flag is set. Most messages already do
this, set this for the ones that do not.

This will be enforced in future firmware that better match the TI-SCI
specifications, this patch will not break users of existing firmware.
