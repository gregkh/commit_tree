gpio: don't WARN() on NULL descs if gpiolib is disabled

If gpiolib is disabled, we use the inline stubs from gpio/consumer.h
instead of regular definitions of GPIO API. The stubs for 'optional'
variants of gpiod_get routines return NULL in this case as if the
relevant GPIO wasn't found. This is correct so far.

Calling other (non-gpio_get) stubs from this header triggers a warning
because the GPIO descriptor couldn't have been requested. The warning
however is unconditional (WARN_ON(1)) and is emitted even if the passed
descriptor pointer is NULL.

We don't want to force the users of 'optional' gpio_get to check the
returned pointer before calling e.g. gpiod_set_value() so let's only
WARN on non-NULL descriptors.
