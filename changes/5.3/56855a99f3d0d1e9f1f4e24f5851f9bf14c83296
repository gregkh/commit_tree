ACPI/PPTT: Add function to return ACPI 6.3 Identical tokens

ACPI 6.3 adds a flag to indicate that child nodes are all
identical cores. This is useful to authoritatively determine
if a set of (possibly offline) cores are identical or not.

Since the flag doesn't give us a unique id we can generate
one and use it to create bitmaps of sibling nodes, or simply
in a loop to determine if a subset of cores are identical.
