tracing/probe: Add trace_event_file access APIs for trace_probe

Add trace_event_file access APIs for trace_probe data structure.
This simplifies enabling/disabling operations in uprobe and kprobe
events so that those don't touch deep inside the trace_probe.

This also removing a redundant synchronization when the
kprobe event is used from perf, since the perf itself uses
tracepoint_synchronize_unregister() after disabling (ftrace-
defined) event, thus we don't have to synchronize in that
path. Also we don't need to identify local trace_kprobe too
anymore.
