f2fs: use generic EFSBADCRC/EFSCORRUPTED

f2fs uses EFAULT as error number to indicate filesystem is corrupted
all the time, but generic filesystems use EUCLEAN for such condition,
we need to change to follow others.

This patch adds two new macros as below to wrap more generic error
code macros, and spread them in code.

EFSBADCRC	EBADMSG		/* Bad CRC detected */
EFSCORRUPTED	EUCLEAN		/* Filesystem is corrupted */
