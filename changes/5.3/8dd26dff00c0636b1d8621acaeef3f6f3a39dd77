ASoC: dapm: Fix handling of custom_stop_condition on DAPM graph walks

DPCM uses snd_soc_dapm_dai_get_connected_widgets to build a
list of the widgets connected to a specific front end DAI so it
can search through this list for available back end DAIs. The
custom_stop_condition was added to is_connected_ep to facilitate this
list not containing more widgets than is necessary. Doing so both
speeds up the DPCM handling as less widgets need to be searched and
avoids issues with CODEC to CODEC links as these would be confused
with back end DAIs if they appeared in the list of available widgets.

custom_stop_condition was implemented by aborting the graph walk
when the condition is triggered, however there is an issue with this
approach. Whilst walking the graph is_connected_ep should update the
endpoints cache on each widget, if the walk is aborted the number
of attached end points is unknown for that sub-graph. When the stop
condition triggered, the original patch ignored the triggering widget
and returned zero connected end points; a later patch updated this
to set the triggering widget's cache to 1 and return that. Both of
these approaches result in inaccurate values being stored in various
end point caches as the values propagate back through the graph,
which can result in later issues with widgets powering/not powering
unexpectedly.

As the original goal was to reduce the size of the widget list passed
to the DPCM code, the simplest solution is to limit the functionality
of the custom_stop_condition to the widget list. This means the rest
of the graph will still be processed resulting in correct end point
caches, but only widgets up to the stop condition will be added to the
returned widget list.
