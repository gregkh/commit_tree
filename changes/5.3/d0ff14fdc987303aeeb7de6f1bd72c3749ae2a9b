genirq: Properly pair kobject_del() with kobject_add()

If alloc_descs() fails before irq_sysfs_init() has run, free_desc() in the
cleanup path will call kobject_del() even though the kobject has not been
added with kobject_add().

Fix this by making the call to kobject_del() conditional on whether
irq_sysfs_init() has run.

This problem surfaced because commit aa30f47cf666 ("kobject: Add support
for default attribute groups to kobj_type") makes kobject_del() stricter
about pairing with kobject_add(). If the pairing is incorrrect, a WARNING
and backtrace occur in sysfs_remove_group() because there is no parent.

[ tglx: Add a comment to the code and make it work with CONFIG_SYSFS=n ]
