Input: elan_i2c - remove Lenovo Legion Y7000 PnpID

Looks like the Bios of the Lenovo Legion Y7000 is using ELAN061B
when the actual device is supposed to be used with hid-multitouch.

Remove it from the list of the supported device, hoping that
no one will complain about the loss in functionality.
