binder: return errors from buffer copy functions

The buffer copy functions assumed the caller would ensure
correct alignment and that the memory to be copied was
completely within the binder buffer. There have been
a few cases discovered by syzkallar where a malformed
transaction created by a user could violated the
assumptions and resulted in a BUG_ON.

The fix is to remove the BUG_ON and always return the
error to be handled appropriately by the caller.
