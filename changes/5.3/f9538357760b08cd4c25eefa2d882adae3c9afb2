drm/bridge: tc358767: clean-up link training

The current link training code does unnecessary retry-loops, and does
extra writes to the registers. It is easier to follow the flow and
ensure it's similar to Toshiba's documentation if we deal with LT inside
tc_main_link_enable() function.

This patch adds tc_wait_link_training() which handles waiting for the LT
phase to finish, and does the necessary LT register setups in
tc_main_link_enable, without extra loops.
