drm/amd/powerplay: wake up azalia from d3 by sending smu message

this is hw workaround to wake up azalia from d3. display asic
and azalia are two different pci devices. while display asic
wake from d3, current hw does not send signal to azalia.
workaround: display driver ask smu send message to azalia device
to let azalia wake up.

Defintion of SMU message, like PPSMC_MSG_BacroAudioD3PME, is per
asic. It is shared by different OS.
