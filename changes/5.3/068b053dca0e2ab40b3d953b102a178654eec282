x86/MCE: Determine MCA banks' init state properly

The OS is expected to write all bits to MCA_CTL for each bank,
thus enabling error reporting in all banks. However, some banks
may be unused in which case the registers for such banks are
Read-as-Zero/Writes-Ignored. Also, the OS may avoid setting some control
bits because of quirks, etc.

A bank can be considered uninitialized if the MCA_CTL register returns
zero. This is because either the OS did not write anything or because
the hardware is enforcing RAZ/WI for the bank.

Set a bank's init value based on if the control bits are set or not in
hardware. Return an error code in the sysfs interface for uninitialized
banks.

Do a final bank init check in a separate function which is not part of
any user-controlled code flows. This is so a user may enable/disable a
bank during runtime without having to restart their system.
