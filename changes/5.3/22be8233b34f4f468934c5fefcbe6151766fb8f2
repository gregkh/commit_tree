media: videodev2.h: change V4L2_PIX_FMT_BGRA444 define: fourcc was already in use

The V4L2_PIX_FMT_BGRA444 define clashed with the pre-existing V4L2_PIX_FMT_SGRBG12
which strangely enough used the same fourcc, even though that fourcc made no sense
for a Bayer format. In any case, you can't have duplicates, so change the fourcc of
V4L2_PIX_FMT_BGRA444.
