staging: kpc2000: declare two functions as static.

Two functions were not used outside the translation-unit in which they
were defined.  Declared them static.

Fixes two sparse warnings:

  drivers/staging/kpc2000/kpc2000/cell_probe.c:98:5: warning: symbol 'probe_core_basic' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/staging/kpc2000/kpc2000/cell_probe.c:288:5: warning: symbol 'probe_core_uio' was not declared. Should it be static?
