net: hns3: optimize the CSQ cmd error handling

If CMDQ ring is full, hclge_cmd_send may return directly, but IMP still
working and HW pointer changed, SW ring pointer do not match the HW
pointer. This patch update the SW pointer every time when the space is
full, so it can work normally next time if IMP and HW still working.
