staging: bcm2835-camera: Correct ctrl min/max/step/def to 64bit

The V4L2 control API was expanded to take 64 bit values in commit
0ba2aeb6dab (Apr 16 2014), but as this driver wasn't in the mainline
kernel at that point this was overlooked.

Update to use 64 bit values. This also fixes a couple of warnings
in 64 bit builds.
