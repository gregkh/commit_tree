ipv4: Use accessors for fib_info nexthop data

Use helpers to access fib_nh and fib_nhs fields of a fib_info. Drop the
fib_dev macro which is an alias for the first nexthop. Replacements:

  fi->fib_dev    --> fib_info_nh(fi, 0)->fib_nh_dev
  fi->fib_nh     --> fib_info_nh(fi, 0)
  fi->fib_nh[i]  --> fib_info_nh(fi, i)
  fi->fib_nhs    --> fib_info_num_path(fi)

where fib_info_nh(fi, i) returns fi->fib_nh[nhsel] and fib_info_num_path
returns fi->fib_nhs.

Move the existing fib_info_nhc to nexthop.h and define the new ones
there. A later patch adds a check if a fib_info uses a nexthop object,
and defining the helpers in nexthop.h avoid circular header
dependencies.

After this all remaining open coded references to fi->fib_nhs and
fi->fib_nh are in:
- fib_create_info and helpers used to lookup an existing fib_info
  entry, and
- the netdev event functions fib_sync_down_dev and fib_sync_up.

The latter two will not be reused for nexthops, and the fib_create_info
will be updated to handle a nexthop in a fib_info.
