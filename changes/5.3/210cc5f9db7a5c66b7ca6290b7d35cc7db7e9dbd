perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add uncore support for Snow Ridge server

The uncore subsystem on Snow Ridge is similar as previous SKX server.
The uncore units on Snow Ridge include Ubox, Chabox, IIO, IRP, M2PCIE,
PCU, M2M, PCIE3 and IMC.

- The config register encoding and pci device IDs are changed.
- For CHA, the umask_ext and filter_tid fields are changed.
- For IIO, the ch_mask and fc_mask fields are changed.
- For M2M, the mask_ext field is changed.
- Add new PCIe3 unit for PCIe3 root port which provides the interface
  between PCIe devices, plugged into the PCIe port, and the components
  (in M2IOSF).
- IMC can only be accessed via MMIO on Snow Ridge now. Current common
  code doesn't support it yet. IMC will be supported in following
  patches.
- There are 9 free running counters for IIO CLOCKS and bandwidth In.
- Full uncore event list is not published yet. Event constrain is not
  included in this patch. It will be added later separately.
