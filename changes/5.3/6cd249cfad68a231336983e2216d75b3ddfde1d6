ASoC: max98357a: use mdelay for sdmode-delay

max98357a_daiops_trigger() is possible to be called in atomic context if
the .nonatomic flag is equal to 0 in the DAI links.

When cancel_delayed_work_sync() in max98357a_daiops_trigger() is called
in atomic context, kernel emits the following message: "BUG: sleeping
function called from invalid context".

According to the DT binding document, value less than or equal to 5ms of
sdmod-delay should be sufficient to avoid the pop noise.  Use mdelay
(i.e. busy loop) for such low delay should be acceptable.

startup")
