iavf: fix dereference of null rx_buffer pointer

A recent commit efa14c3985828d ("iavf: allow null RX descriptors") added
a null pointer sanity check on rx_buffer, however, rx_buffer is being
dereferenced before that check, which implies a null pointer dereference
bug can potentially occur.  Fix this by only dereferencing rx_buffer
until after the null pointer check.
