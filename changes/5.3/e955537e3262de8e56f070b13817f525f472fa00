gfs2: eliminate tr_num_revoke_rm

For its journal processing, gfs2 kept track of the number of buffers
added and removed on a per-transaction basis. These values are used
to calculate space needed in the journal. But while these calculations
make sense for the number of buffers, they make no sense for revokes.
Revokes are managed in their own list, linked from the superblock.
So it's entirely unnecessary to keep separate per-transaction counts
for revokes added and removed. A single count will do the same job.
Therefore, this patch combines the transaction revokes into a single
count.
