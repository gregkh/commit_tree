net: dsa: sja1105: Don't check state->link in phylink_mac_config

It has been pointed out that PHYLINK can call mac_config only to update
the phy_interface_type and without knowing what the AN results are.

Experimentally, when this was observed to happen, state->link was also
unset, and therefore was used as a proxy to ignore this call. However it
is also suggested that state->link is undefined for this callback and
should not be relied upon.

So let the previously-dead codepath for SPEED_UNKNOWN be called, and
update the comment to make sure the MAC's behavior is sane.
