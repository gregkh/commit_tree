perf script: Assume native_arch for pipe mode

In pipe mode, session->header.env.arch is not populated until the events
are processed. Therefore, the following command crashes:

   perf record -o - | perf script

(gdb) bt

It fails when we try to compare env.arch against uts.machine:

        if (!strcmp(uts.machine, session->header.env.arch) ||
            (!strcmp(uts.machine, "x86_64") &&
             !strcmp(session->header.env.arch, "i386")))
                native_arch = true;

In pipe mode, it is tricky to find env.arch at this stage. To keep it
simple, let's just assume native_arch is always true for pipe mode.
