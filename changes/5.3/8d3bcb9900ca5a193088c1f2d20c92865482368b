crypto: sun4i-ss - reduce stack usage

After the latest addition, the stack usage of sun4i_ss_cipher_poll
grew beyond the warning limit when KASAN is enabled:

drivers/crypto/sunxi-ss/sun4i-ss-cipher.c:118:12: error: stack frame size of 1152 bytes in function 'sun4i_ss_cipher_poll' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]
static int sun4i_ss_cipher_poll(struct skcipher_request *areq)

Reduce it in three ways:

- split out the new code into a separate function so its stack
  usage can overlap that of the sun4i_ss_opti_poll() code path
- mark both special cases as noinline_for_stack, which should
  ideally result in a tail call that frees the rest of the
  stack
- move the buf and obuf variables into the code blocks in
  which they are used.

The three separate functions now use 144, 640 and 304 bytes of kernel
stack, respectively.
