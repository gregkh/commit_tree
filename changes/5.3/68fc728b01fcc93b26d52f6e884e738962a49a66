drm/i915: Downgrade NEWCLIENT to non-preemptive

Commit 1413b2bc0717 ("drm/i915: Trim NEWCLIENT boosting") had the
intended consequence of not allowing a sequence of work that merely
crossed into a new engine the privilege to be promoted to NEWCLIENT
status. It also had the unintended consequence of actually making
NEWCLIENT effective on heavily oversubscribed transcode machines and
impacting upon their throughput.

If we consider a client packet composed of (rcsA, rcsB, vcs) and 30 of
those clients, using the NEWCLIENT boost that will be scheduled as

	rcsA x 30, (rcsB, vcs) x 30

where as before it would have been

	(rcsA, rcsB, vcs) x 30

That is with NEWCLIENT only boosting the first request of each client,
we would execute all rcsA requests prior to running on the vcs engines;
acruing a lot of dead time as compared to the previous case where the
vcs engine would be started in parallel to processing the second client.

The previous patch has the effect of delaying submission until it is
required by a third party (either the user with an explicit wait, or by
another client/engine). We reduce the NEWCLIENT bump to a mere WAIT,
which has the effect of removing its preemptive grant and reducing it to
the same level as any other user interaction -- that it will not be
promoted above the interengine dependencies, and so preventing NEWCLIENTS
from starving other engines. This a large nerf to the rrul properties of
the current NEWCLIENT, but it still does give prioritised submission to
new requests from light workloads.
