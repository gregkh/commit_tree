powerpc/nvdimm: Pick nearby online node if the device node is not online

Currently, nvdimm subsystem expects the device numa node for SCM device to be
an online node. It also doesn't try to bring the device numa node online. Hence
if we use a non-online numa node as device node we hit crashes like below. This
is because we try to access uninitialized NODE_DATA in different code paths.

The patch tries to fix this by picking the nearest online node as the SCM node.
This does have a problem of us losing the information that SCM node is
equidistant from two other online nodes. If applications need to understand these
fine-grained details we should express then like x86 doesÂ via
/sys/devices/system/node/nodeX/accessY/initiators/

With the patch we get
