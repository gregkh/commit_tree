ASoC: rt5677: fall back to DT prop names on error

The rt5677 driver uses ACPI-style property names to read from the
device API. However, these do not match the property names in _DSD
used on the Chromebook Pixel 2015, which are closer to the Device Tree
style.  Unify the two functions for reading from the device API so that
they try ACPI-style names first and fall back to the DT names on error.

With this patch, plugging and unplugging the headphone jack switches
between headphones and speakers automatically.
