staging: kpc2000: fix integer overflow with left shifts

Currently there are several left shifts that are assigned to 64 bit
unsigned longs where a signed int 1 is being shifted, resulting in
an integer overflow.  Fix this bit using the BIT_ULL macro to perform
a 64 bit shift.  Also clean up an overly long statement.
