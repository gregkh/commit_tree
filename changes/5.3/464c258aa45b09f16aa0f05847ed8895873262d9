selinux: fix empty write to keycreate file

When sid == 0 (we are resetting keycreate_sid to the default value), we
should skip the KEY__CREATE check.

Before this patch, doing a zero-sized write to /proc/self/keycreate
would check if the current task can create unlabeled keys (which would
usually fail with -EACCESS and generate an AVC). Now it skips the check
and correctly sets the task's keycreate_sid to 0.

Tested using the reproducer from the report above.
