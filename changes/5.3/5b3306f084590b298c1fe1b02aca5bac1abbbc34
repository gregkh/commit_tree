powerpc/pseries: Do not save the previous DTL mask value

When CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE is enabled, we always initialize
DTL enable mask to DTL_LOG_PREEMPT (0x2). There are no other places
where the mask is changed. As such, when reading the DTL log buffer
through debugfs, there is no need to save and restore the previous mask
value.

We don't need to save and restore the earlier mask value if
CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE is not enabled. So, remove the field
from the structure as well.
