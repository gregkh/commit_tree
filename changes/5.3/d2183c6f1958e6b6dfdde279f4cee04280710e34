RDMA/umem: Move page_shift from ib_umem to ib_odp_umem

This value has always been set to PAGE_SHIFT in the core code, the only
thing that does differently was the ODP path. Move the value into the ODP
struct and still use it for ODP, but change all the non-ODP things to just
use PAGE_SHIFT/PAGE_SIZE/PAGE_MASK directly.
