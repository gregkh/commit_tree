ipv4: Multipath hashing on inner L3 needs to consider inner IPv6 pkts

Commit 363887a2cdfe ("ipv4: Support multipath hashing on inner IP pkts
for GRE tunnel") supports multipath policy value of 2, Layer 3 or inner
Layer 3 if present, but it only considers inner IPv4. There is a use
case of IPv6 is tunneled by IPv4 GRE, thus add the ability to hash on
inner IPv6 addresses.
