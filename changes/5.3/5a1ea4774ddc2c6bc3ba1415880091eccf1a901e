powerpc/pseries: Move mm/book3s64/vphn.c under platforms/pseries/

hcall_vphn() is specific to pseries and will be used in a subsequent
patch. So, move it to a more appropriate place under
arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries. Also merge vphn.h into lppaca.h
and update vphn selftest to use the new files.
