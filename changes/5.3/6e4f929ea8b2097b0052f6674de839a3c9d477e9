x86/mce: Do not check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value. The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

The only way this can fail is if:

 * debugfs superblock can not be pinned - something really went wrong with the
 vfs layer.
 * file is created with same name - the caller's fault.
 * new_inode() fails - happens if memory is exhausted.

so failing to clean up debugfs properly is the least of the system's
sproblems in uch a situation.
