udf: Fix incorrect final NOT_ALLOCATED (hole) extent length

In some cases, using the 'truncate' command to extend a UDF file results
in a mismatch between the length of the file's extents (specifically, due
to incorrect length of the final NOT_ALLOCATED extent) and the information
(file) length. The discrepancy can prevent other operating systems
(i.e., Windows 10) from opening the file.

Two particular errors have been observed when extending a file:

1. The final extent is larger than it should be, having been rounded up
   to a multiple of the block size.

B. The final extent is not shorter than it should be, due to not having
   been updated when the file's information length was increased.

[JK: simplified udf_do_extend_final_block(), fixed up some types]
