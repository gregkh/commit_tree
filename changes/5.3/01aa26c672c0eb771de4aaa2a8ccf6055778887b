s390/cio: Combine direct and indirect CCW paths

With both the direct-addressed and indirect-addressed CCW paths
simplified to this point, the amount of shared code between them is
(hopefully) more easily visible.  Move the processing of IDA-specific
bits into the direct-addressed path, and add some useful commentary of
what the individual pieces are doing.  This allows us to remove the
entire ccwchain_fetch_idal() routine and maintain a single function
for any non-TIC CCW.
