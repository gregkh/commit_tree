RISC-V: Fix memory reservation in setup_bootmem()

Currently, the setup_bootmem() reserves memory from RAM start to the
kernel end. This prevents us from exploring ways to use the RAM below
(or before) the kernel start hence this patch updates setup_bootmem()
to only reserve memory from the kernel start to the kernel end.
