ASoC: ti: davinci-mcasp: Correct slot_width posed constraint

The slot_width is a property for the bus while the constraint for
SNDRV_PCM_HW_PARAM_SAMPLE_BITS is for the in memory format.

Applying slot_width constraint to sample_bits works most of the time, but
it will blacklist valid formats in some cases.

With slot_width 24 we can support S24_3LE and S24_LE formats as they both
look the same on the bus, but a a 24 constraint on sample_bits would not
allow S24_LE as it is stored in 32bits in memory.

Implement a simple hw_rule function to allow all formats which require less
or equal number of bits on the bus as slot_width (if configured).
