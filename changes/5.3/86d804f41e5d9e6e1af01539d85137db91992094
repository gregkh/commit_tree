drm/sun4i: sun6i_mipi_dsi: Support DSI GENERIC_SHORT_WRITE_2 transfer

Some DSI panels do use GENERIC_SHORT_WRITE_2 transfer protocol to host
DSI driver and which is similar to GENERIC_SHORT_WRITE.

Add support for the same transfer, so-that so-that the panels which are
requesting similar transfer type will process properly.
