rbd: get rid of obj_req->xferred, obj_req->result and img_req->xferred

obj_req->xferred and img_req->xferred don't bring any value.  The
former is used for short reads and has to be set to obj_req->ex.oe_len
after that and elsewhere.  The latter is just an aggregate.

Use result for short reads (>=0 - number of bytes read, <0 - error) and
pass it around explicitly.  No need to store it in obj_req.
