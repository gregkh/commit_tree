io_uring: fix counter inc/dec mismatch in async_list

We could queue a work for each req in defer and link list without
increasing async_list->cnt, so we shouldn't decrease it while exiting
from workqueue as well if we didn't process the req in async list.

Thanks to Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk> for his guidance.
