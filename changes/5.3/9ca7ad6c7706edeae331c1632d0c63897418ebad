drm: msm: Fix add_gpu_components

add_gpu_components() adds found GPU nodes from the DT to the match list,
regardless of the status of the nodes.  This is a problem, because if the
nodes are disabled, they should not be on the match list because they will
not be matched.  This prevents display from initing if a GPU node is
defined, but it's status is disabled.

Fix this by checking the node's status before adding it to the match list.
