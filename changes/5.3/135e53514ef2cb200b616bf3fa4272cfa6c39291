mm/memory-failure.c: clarify error message

Some user who install SIGBUS handler that does longjmp out therefore
keeping the process alive is confused by the error message

  "[188988.765862] Memory failure: 0x1840200: Killing cellsrv:33395 due to hardware memory corruption"

Slightly modify the error message to improve clarity.
