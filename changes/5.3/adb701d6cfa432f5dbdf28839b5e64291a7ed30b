selftests: add a test case for rp_filter

Add a test case to simulate the loopback packet case fixed
in the previous patch.

This test gets passed after the fix:

IPv4 rp_filter tests
    TEST: rp_filter passes local packets                                [ OK ]
    TEST: rp_filter passes loopback packets                             [ OK ]
