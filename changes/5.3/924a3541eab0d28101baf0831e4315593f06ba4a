scsi: libsas: aic94xx: hisi_sas: mvsas: pm8001: Use dev_is_expander()

Many times in libsas, and in LLDDs which use libsas, the check for an
expander device is re-implemented or open coded.

Use dev_is_expander() instead. We rename this from
sas_dev_type_is_expander() to not spill so many lines in referencing.
