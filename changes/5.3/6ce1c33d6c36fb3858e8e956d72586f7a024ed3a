drm/i915: Kill INTEL_SUBPLATFORM_AML

All AML parts are either KBL ULX or CFL ULX so there is no point
in keeping INTEL_SUBPLATFORM_AML around. As these are the only
CFL ULX parts (normal CFL didn't have Y SKUs) so we'll just
replace IS_AML_ULX with IS_CFL_ULX (it was already paired with
IS_KBL_ULX which accounts for the other half of the AML parts).
