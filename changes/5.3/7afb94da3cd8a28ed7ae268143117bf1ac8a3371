mwifiex: update set_mac_address logic

In set_mac_address, driver check for interfaces with same bss_type
For first STA entry, this would return 3 interfaces since all priv's have
bss_type as 0 due to kzalloc. Thus mac address gets changed for STA
unexpected. This patch adds check for first STA and avoids mac address
change. This patch also adds mac_address change for p2p based on bss_num
type.
