media: mt9m111: add regulator support

In the soc_camera removal, the board specific power callback was
dropped. This at least will remove the power optimization from ezx and
em-x270 pxa based boards.

As to recreate the same level of functionality, make the mt9m111 have a
regulator providing it its power, so that board designers can plug in a
gpio based or ldo regulator, mimicking their former soc_camera power
hook.
