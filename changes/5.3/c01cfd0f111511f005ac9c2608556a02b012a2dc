net/mlx5: E-Switch, Add match on vport metadata for rule in fast path

If FW's capabilities and configurations meet the requirement of vport
metadata matching, this feature will be used. As the information
about vport number and vhca_id related to packet is already stored to
its metadata register, which is used as an indicator for perticular
vport, now we can change to match on this metadata for all the
offloading rules in fast path.
