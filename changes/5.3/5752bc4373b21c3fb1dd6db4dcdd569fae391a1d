mfd: rk808: Mark pm functions __maybe_unused

The newly added suspend/resume functions are only used if CONFIG_PM
is enabled:

drivers/mfd/rk808.c:752:12: error: 'rk8xx_resume' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
drivers/mfd/rk808.c:732:12: error: 'rk8xx_suspend' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

Mark them as __maybe_unused so the compiler can silently drop them
when they are not needed.
