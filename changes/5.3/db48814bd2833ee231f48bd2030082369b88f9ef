libbpf: identify maps by section index in addition to offset

To support maps to be defined in multiple sections, it's important to
identify map not just by offset within its section, but section index as
well. This patch adds tracking of section index.

For global data, we record section index of corresponding
.data/.bss/.rodata ELF section for uniformity, and thus don't need
a special value of offset for those maps.
