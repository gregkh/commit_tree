netfilter: nf_tables: Make nft_meta expression more robust

nft_meta_get_eval()'s tendency to bail out setting NFT_BREAK verdict in
situations where required data is missing leads to unexpected behaviour
with inverted checks like so:

| meta iifname != eth0 accept

This rule will never match if there is no input interface (or it is not
known) which is not intuitive and, what's worse, breaks consistency of
iptables-nft with iptables-legacy.

Fix this by falling back to placing a value in dreg which never matches
(avoiding accidental matches), i.e. zero for interface index and an
empty string for interface name.
