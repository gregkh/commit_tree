drm/i915: Disable power asynchronously during DP AUX transfers

In a follow-up patch we will restrict holding the reference on the AUX
power domain to the AUX transfer function. To avoid the unnecessary
on-off-on power togglings drop the reference asynchronously.

There is no reason we couldn't do this in general and also put the
reference asynchronously in pps_unlock(); but that's a separate change
that can be done as a follow-up.
