sbitmap: Replace cmpxchg with xchg

cmpxchg() with an immediate value could be replaced with less expensive
xchg(). The same true if new value don't _depend_ on the old one.

In the second block, atomic_cmpxchg() return value isn't checked, so
after atomic_cmpxchg() ->  atomic_xchg() conversion it could be replaced
with atomic_set(). Comparison with atomic_read() in the second chunk was
left as an optimisation (if that was the initial intention).
