i2c: mt7621: Add MediaTek MT7621/7628/7688 I2C driver

This patch adds a driver for the I2C controller found on the MediaTek
MT7621/7628/7688 SoC's. The base version of this driver was done by
Steven Liu (according to the copyright and MODULE_AUTHOR lines). It
can be found in the OpenWRT repositories (v4.14 at the time I looked).

The base driver had many issues, which are disccussed here:

>From this link an enhanced driver version (complete rewrite, mayor
changes: support clock stretching, repeated start, ACK handling and
unlimited message length) from Jan Breuer can be found here:
