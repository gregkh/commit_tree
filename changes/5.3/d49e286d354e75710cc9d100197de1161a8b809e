ixgbe: add tracking of AF_XDP zero-copy state for each queue pair

Here, we add a bitmap to the ixgbe_adapter that tracks if a
certain queue pair has been "zero-copy enabled" via the ndo_bpf.
The bitmap is used in ixgbe_xsk_umem, and enables zero-copy if
and only if XDP is enabled, the corresponding qid in the bitmap
is set, and the umem is non-NULL;
