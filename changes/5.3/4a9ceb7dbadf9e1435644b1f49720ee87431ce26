IB/{rdmavt, qib, hfi1}: Convert to new completion API

Convert all completions to use the new completion routine that
fixes a race between post send and completion where fields from
a SWQE can be read after SWQE has been freed.

This patch also addresses issues reported in
https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=155656897409107&w=2.

The reserved operation path has no need for any barrier.

The barrier for the other path is addressed by the
smp_load_acquire() barrier.
