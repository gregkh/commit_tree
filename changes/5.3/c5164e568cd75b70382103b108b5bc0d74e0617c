staging: kpc2000: kpc_i2c: Use BIT macro rather than manual bit shifting

The FEATURES_* symbols use bit shifting of the style (1 << k) in order
to assign a certain meaning to the value of inividual bits being set
in the value of a given variable. Instead, use the BIT() macro in
order to improve readability and maintain consistency with the rest
of the kernel.
