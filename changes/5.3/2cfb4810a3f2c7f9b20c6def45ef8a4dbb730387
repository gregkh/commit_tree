s390/qeth: dynamically allocate vnicc cmds

The VNICC code is somewhat quirky in that it defers the whole cmd setup
to a common helper qeth_l2_vnicc_request(). Some of the cmd specifics
are then passed in via parameter, while others are simply hard-coded.

Split the whole machinery up into the usual format: one helper that
allocates the cmd & fills in the common fields, while all the cmd
originators take care of their sub-cmd type specific work.
This makes it much easier to calculate the cmd's precise length, and
reduces code complexity.
