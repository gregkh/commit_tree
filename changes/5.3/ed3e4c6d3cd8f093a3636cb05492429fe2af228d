iwlwifi: fix RF-Kill interrupt while FW load for gen2 devices

Newest devices have a new firmware load mechanism. This
mechanism is called the context info. It means that the
driver doesn't need to load the sections of the firmware.
The driver rather prepares a place in DRAM, with pointers
to the relevant sections of the firmware, and the firmware
loads itself.
At the end of the process, the firmware sends the ALIVE
interrupt. This is different from the previous scheme in
which the driver expected the FH_TX interrupt after each
section being transferred over the DMA.

In order to support this new flow, we enabled all the
interrupts. This broke the assumption that we have in the
code that the RF-Kill interrupt can't interrupt the firmware
load flow.

Change the context info flow to enable only the ALIVE
interrupt, and re-enable all the other interrupts only
after the firmware is alive. Then, we won't see the RF-Kill
interrupt until then. Getting the RF-Kill interrupt while
loading the firmware made us kill the firmware while it is
loading and we ended up dumping garbage instead of the firmware
state.

Re-enable the ALIVE | RX interrupts from the ISR when we
get the ALIVE interrupt to be able to get the RX interrupt
that comes immediately afterwards for the ALIVE
notification. This is needed for non MSI-X only.
