xen/swiotlb: fix condition for calling xen_destroy_contiguous_region()

The condition in xen_swiotlb_free_coherent() for deciding whether to
call xen_destroy_contiguous_region() is wrong: in case the region to
be freed is not contiguous calling xen_destroy_contiguous_region() is
the wrong thing to do: it would result in inconsistent mappings of
multiple PFNs to the same MFN. This will lead to various strange
crashes or data corruption.

Instead of calling xen_destroy_contiguous_region() in that case a
warning should be issued as that situation should never occur.
