perf evsel: Make perf_evsel__name() accept a NULL argument

In which case it simply returns "unknown", like when it can't figure out
the evsel->name value.

This makes this code more robust and fixes a problem in 'perf trace'
where a NULL evsel was being passed to a routine that only used the
evsel for printing its name when a invalid syscall id was passed.
