wimax/i2400m: fix a memory leak bug

In i2400m_barker_db_init(), 'options_orig' is allocated through kstrdup()
to hold the original command line options. Then, the options are parsed.
However, if an error occurs during the parsing process, 'options_orig' is
not deallocated, leading to a memory leak bug. To fix this issue, free
'options_orig' before returning the error.
