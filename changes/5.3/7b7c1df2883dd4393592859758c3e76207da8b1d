lib/mpi/longlong.h: fix building with 32-bit x86

The mpi library contains some rather old inline assembly statements that
produce a lot of warnings for 32-bit x86, such as:

  lib/mpi/mpih-div.c:76:16: error: invalid use of a cast in a inline asm context requiring an l-value: remove the cast or build with -fheinous-gnu-extensions
                                  udiv_qrnnd(qp[i], n1, n1, np[i], d);
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  lib/mpi/longlong.h:423:20: note: expanded from macro 'udiv_qrnnd'
          : "=a" ((USItype)(q)), \
                  ~~~~~~~~~~^~

There is no point in doing a type cast for the output of an inline
assembler statement, so just remove the cast here, as we have done for
other architectures in the past.
