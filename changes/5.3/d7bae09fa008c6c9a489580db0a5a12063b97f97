net: bridge: delete local fdb on device init failure

On initialization failure we have to delete the local fdb which was
inserted due to the default pvid creation. This problem has been present
since the inception of default_pvid. Note that currently there are 2 cases:
1) in br_dev_init() when br_multicast_init() fails
2) if register_netdevice() fails after calling ndo_init()

This patch takes care of both since br_vlan_flush() is called on both
occasions. Also the new fdb delete would be a no-op on normal bridge
device destruction since the local fdb would've been already flushed by
br_dev_delete(). This is not an issue for ports since nbp_vlan_init() is
called last when adding a port thus nothing can fail after it.
