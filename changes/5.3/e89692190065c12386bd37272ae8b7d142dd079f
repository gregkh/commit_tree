mm/kasan: print frame description for stack bugs

This adds support for printing stack frame description on invalid stack
accesses.  The frame description is embedded by the compiler, which is
parsed and then pretty-printed.

Currently, we can only print the stack frame info for accesses to the
task's own stack, but not accesses to other tasks' stacks.

Example of what it looks like:

  page dumped because: kasan: bad access detected

  addr ffff8880673ef98a is located in stack of task insmod/2008 at offset 106 in frame:
   kasan_stack_oob+0x0/0xf5 [test_kasan]

  this frame has 2 objects:
   [32, 36) 'i'
   [96, 106) 'stack_array'

  Memory state around the buggy address:
