ALSA: usb-audio: fix a memory leak bug

In snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3(), a structure for channel maps 'chmap' is
allocated through kzalloc() before the execution goto 'found_clock'.
However, this structure is not deallocated if the memory allocation for
'pd' fails, leading to a memory leak bug.

To fix the above issue, free 'fp->chmap' before returning NULL.
