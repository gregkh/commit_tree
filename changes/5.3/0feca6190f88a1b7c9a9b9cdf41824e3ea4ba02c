net: ipv6: add skbuff fraglist splitter

This patch adds the skbuff fraglist split iterator. This API provides an
iterator to transform the fraglist into single skbuff objects, it
consists of:

* ip6_fraglist_init(), that initializes the internal state of the
  fraglist iterator.
* ip6_fraglist_prepare(), that restores the IPv6 header on the fragment.
* ip6_fraglist_next(), that retrieves the fragment from the fraglist and
  updates the internal state of the iterator to point to the next
  fragment in the fraglist.

The ip6_fraglist_iter object stores the internal state of the iterator.

This code has been extracted from ip6_fragment(). Symbols are also
exported to allow to reuse this iterator from the bridge codepath to
build its own refragmentation routine by reusing the existing codebase.
