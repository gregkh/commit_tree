staging: kpc2000: kpc_i2c: Remove unnecessary function tracing prints

Many of the functions in kpc_i2c log debug-level messages to the
kernel log message buffer upon invocation. This is unnecessary, as
debugging tools like kgdb, kdb, etc. or the tracing tool ftrace
should be able to provide this same information. Therefore, remove
these print statements.
