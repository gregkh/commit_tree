x86/kvm/VMX: drop bad asm() clobber from nested_vmx_check_vmentry_hw()

While upstream gcc doesn't detect conflicts on cc (yet), it really
should, and hence "cc" should not be specified for asm()-s also having
"=@cc<cond>" outputs. (It is quite pointless anyway to specify a "cc"
clobber in x86 inline assembly, since the compiler assumes it to be
always clobbered, and has no means [yet] to suppress this behavior.)
