IB/rdmavt: Add new completion inline

There is opencoded send completion logic all over all
the drivers.

We need to convert to this routine to enforce ordering
issues for completions.  This routine fixes an ordering
issue where the read of the SWQE fields necessary for creating
the completion can race with a post send if the post send catches
a send queue at the edge of being full.  Is is possible in that situation
to read SWQE fields that are being written.

This new routine insures that SWQE fields are read prior to advancing
the index that post send uses to determine queue fullness.
