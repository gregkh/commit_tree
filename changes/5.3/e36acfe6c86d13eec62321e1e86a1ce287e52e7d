mm/hmm: Use hmm_mirror not mm as an argument for hmm_range_register

Ralph observes that hmm_range_register() can only be called by a driver
while a mirror is registered. Make this clear in the API by passing in the
mirror structure as a parameter.

This also simplifies understanding the lifetime model for struct hmm, as
the hmm pointer must be valid as part of a registered mirror so all we
need in hmm_register_range() is a simple kref_get.
