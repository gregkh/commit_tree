drm/i915: Restore control over ppgtt for context creation ABI

Having hid the partially exposed new ABI from the PR, put it back again
for completion of context recovery. A significant part of context
recovery is the ability to reuse as much of the old context as is
feasible (to avoid expensive reconstruction). The biggest chunk kept
hidden at the moment is fine-control over the ctx->ppgtt (the GPU page
tables and associated translation tables and kernel maps), so make
control over the ctx->ppgtt explicit.

This allows userspace to create and share virtual memory address spaces
(within the limits of a single fd) between contexts they own, along with
the ability to query the contexts for the vm state.
