drm/msm/mdp5: Use the interconnect API

The interconnect API provides an interface for consumer drivers to
express their bandwidth needs in the SoC. This data is aggregated
and the on-chip interconnect hardware is configured to the most
appropriate power/performance profile.

Use the API to configure the interconnects and request bandwidth
between DDR and the display hardware (MDP port(s) and rotator
downscaler).

v2: update the path names to be consistent with dpu, handle the NULL
    path case, updated commit msg from Georgi.
v3: split out icc setup into it's own function, and rework logic
    slightly so no interconnect paths is not fatal.
