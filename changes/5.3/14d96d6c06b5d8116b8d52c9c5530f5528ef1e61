x86/topology: Create topology_max_die_per_package()

topology_max_packages() is available to size resources to cover all
packages in the system.

But now multi-die/package systems are coming up, and some resources are
per-die.

Create topology_max_die_per_package(), for detecting multi-die/package
systems, and sizing any per-die resources.
