RDMA: Report available cdevs through RDMA_NLDEV_CMD_GET_CHARDEV

Update the struct ib_client for all modules exporting cdevs related to the
ibdevice to also implement RDMA_NLDEV_CMD_GET_CHARDEV. All cdevs are now
autoloadable and discoverable by userspace over netlink instead of relying
on sysfs.

uverbs also exposes the DRIVER_ID for drivers that are able to support
driver id binding in rdma-core.
