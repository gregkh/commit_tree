ath10k: Use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, change the following form:

sizeof(*rx) + (sizeof(struct htt_rx_indication_mpdu_range) * num_mpdu_ranges)

 to :

struct_size(rx, mpdu_ranges, num_mpdu_ranges)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
