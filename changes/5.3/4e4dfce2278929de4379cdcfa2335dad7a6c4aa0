mm/kmemleak.c: change error at _write when kmemleak is disabled

According to POSIX, EBUSY means that the "device or resource is busy", and
this can lead to people thinking that the file
`/sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak/` is somehow locked or being used by other
process.  Change this error code to a more appropriate one.
