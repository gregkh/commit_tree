KVM: LAPIC: Make lapic timer unpinned

Commit 61abdbe0bcc2 ("kvm: x86: make lapic hrtimer pinned") pinned the
lapic timer to avoid to wait until the next kvm exit for the guest to
see KVM_REQ_PENDING_TIMER set. There is another solution to give a kick
after setting the KVM_REQ_PENDING_TIMER bit, make lapic timer unpinned
will be used in follow up patches.
