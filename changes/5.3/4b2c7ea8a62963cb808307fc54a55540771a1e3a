arm64: dts: qcom-qcs404: Add reset-cells to GCC node

This patch adds a reset-cells property to the gcc controller on the QCS404.
Without this in place, we get warnings like the following if nodes reference
a gcc reset:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/qcs404.dtsi:261.38-310.5: Warning (resets_property):
/soc@0/remoteproc@b00000: Missing property '#reset-cells' in node
/soc@0/clock-controller@1800000 or bad phandle (referred from resets[0])
  also defined at arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/qcs404-evb.dtsi:82.18-84.3
