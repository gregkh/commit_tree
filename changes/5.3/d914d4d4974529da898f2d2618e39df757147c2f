arm64: Implement panic_smp_self_stop()

Currently arm64 uses the default implementation of panic_smp_self_stop()
where the CPU runs in a cpu_relax() loop unable to receive IPIs anymore.
As a result, when two CPUs panic() simultaneously we get "SMP: failed to
stop secondary CPUs" warnings and extra delays before a reset, because
smp_send_stop() still tries to stop the other paniced CPU.

Provide an implementation of panic_smp_self_stop() that is identical to
the IPI CPU stop handler, so that the online status of stopped CPUs gets
properly updated.
