ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable Panfrost and Lima drivers

Enable support for Mali GPU with Panfrost and Lima drivers.  Most of
Exynos chipsets come with Mali GPUs:
1. Mali 400 (Exynos3250, Exynos4210, Exynos4412),
2. Mali T628 (Exynos542x).

As Mali GPU is quite popular among ARM vendors, other platforms will
benefit as well.
