sched/uclamp: Add system default clamps

Tasks without a user-defined clamp value are considered not clamped
and by default their utilization can have any value in the
[0..SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE] range.

Tasks with a user-defined clamp value are allowed to request any value
in that range, and the required clamp is unconditionally enforced.
However, a "System Management Software" could be interested in limiting
the range of clamp values allowed for all tasks.

Add a privileged interface to define a system default configuration via:

  /proc/sys/kernel/sched_uclamp_util_{min,max}

which works as an unconditional clamp range restriction for all tasks.

With the default configuration, the full SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE range of
values is allowed for each clamp index. Otherwise, the task-specific
clamp is capped by the corresponding system default value.

Do that by tracking, for each task, the "effective" clamp value and
bucket the task has been refcounted in at enqueue time. This
allows to lazy aggregate "requested" and "system default" values at
enqueue time and simplifies refcounting updates at dequeue time.

The cached bucket ids are used to avoid (relatively) more expensive
integer divisions every time a task is enqueued.

An active flag is used to report when the "effective" value is valid and
thus the task is actually refcounted in the corresponding rq's bucket.
