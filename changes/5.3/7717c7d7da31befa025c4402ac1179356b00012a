PCI: mobiveil: Mask out hardcoded bits in inbound/outbound windows setup

The lower 10 bits of window size field are hardcoded to zero in HW so
they can't really be changed but the lower 10-bit of PAB_AXI_AMAP_CTRL
register are used for control fields, so while programming inbound and
outbout windows decoding we should mask out the lower 10-bit of window
size to prevent overriding the control bits.
