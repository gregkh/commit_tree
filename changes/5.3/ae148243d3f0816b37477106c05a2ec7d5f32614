dm space map metadata: fix missing store of apply_bops() return value

In commit 6096d91af0b6 ("dm space map metadata: fix occasional leak
of a metadata block on resize"), we refactor the commit logic to a new
function 'apply_bops'.  But when that logic was replaced in out() the
return value was not stored.  This may lead out() returning a wrong
value to the caller.
