net: dsa: Move the phylink driver calls into port.c

In order to have a common handling of PHYLINK for the slave and non-user
ports, the DSA core glue logic (between PHYLINK and the driver) must use
an API that does not rely on a struct net_device.

These will also be called by the CPU-port-handling code in a further
patch.
