tools headers UAPI: Update tools's copy of kvm.h headers

Picking the changes from:

  66bb8a065f5a ("KVM: x86: PMU Event Filter")
  f087a02941fe ("KVM: nVMX: Stash L1's CR3 in vmcs01.GUEST_CR3 on nested entry w/o EPT")
  99adb567632b ("KVM: arm/arm64: Add save/restore support for firmware workaround state")

Silencing this perf build warning:

Now 'perf trace' and other code that might use the tools/perf/trace/beauty autogenerated
tables will be able to translate this new ioctl code into a string:

  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/kvm_ioctl.sh > before
  $
  $ cp include/uapi/linux/kvm.h tools/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h
  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/kvm_ioctl.sh > after
