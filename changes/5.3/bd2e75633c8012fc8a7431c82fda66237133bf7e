dma-contiguous: use fallback alloc_pages for single pages

The addresses within a single page are always contiguous, so it's
not so necessary to always allocate one single page from CMA area.
Since the CMA area has a limited predefined size of space, it may
run out of space in heavy use cases, where there might be quite a
lot CMA pages being allocated for single pages.

However, there is also a concern that a device might care where a
page comes from -- it might expect the page from CMA area and act
differently if the page doesn't.

This patch tries to use the fallback alloc_pages path, instead of
one-page size allocations from the global CMA area in case that a
device does not have its own CMA area. This'd save resources from
the CMA global area for more CMA allocations, and also reduce CMA
fragmentations resulted from trivial allocations.
