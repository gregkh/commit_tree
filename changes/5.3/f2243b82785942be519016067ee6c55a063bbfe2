net: hisilicon: fix hip04-xmit never return TX_BUSY

TX_DESC_NUM is 256, in tx_count, the maximum value of
mod(TX_DESC_NUM - 1) is 254, the variable "count" in
the hip04_mac_start_xmit function is never equal to
(TX_DESC_NUM - 1), so hip04_mac_start_xmit never
return NETDEV_TX_BUSY.

tx_count is modified to mod(TX_DESC_NUM) so that
the maximum value of tx_count can reach
(TX_DESC_NUM - 1), then hip04_mac_start_xmit can reurn
NETDEV_TX_BUSY.
