RDMA/core: Provide RDMA DIM support for ULPs

Added the interface in the infiniband driver that applies the rdma_dim
adaptive moderation. There is now a special function for allocating an
ib_cq that uses rdma_dim.

Performance improvement (ConnectX-5 100GbE, x86) running FIO benchmark over
NVMf between two equal end-hosts with 56 cores across a Mellanox switch
using null_blk device:

The rdma_dim algorithm was designed to measure the effectiveness of
moderation on the flow in a general way and thus should be appropriate
for all RDMA storage protocols.

rdma_dim is configured to be the default option based on performance
improvement seen after extensive tests.
