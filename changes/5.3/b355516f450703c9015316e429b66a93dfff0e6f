dlm: check if workqueues are NULL before flushing/destroying

If the DLM lowcomms stack is shut down before any DLM
traffic can be generated, flush_workqueue() and
destroy_workqueue() can be called on empty send and/or recv
workqueues.

Insert guard conditionals to only call flush_workqueue()
and destroy_workqueue() on workqueues that are not NULL.
