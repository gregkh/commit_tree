KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v2: Handle SGI bits in GICD_I{S,C}PENDR0 as WI

A guest is not allowed to inject a SGI (or clear its pending state)
by writing to GICD_ISPENDR0 (resp. GICD_ICPENDR0), as these bits are
defined as WI (as per ARM IHI 0048B 4.3.7 and 4.3.8).

Make sure we correctly emulate the architecture.
