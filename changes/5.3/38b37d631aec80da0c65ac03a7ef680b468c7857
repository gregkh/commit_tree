module: allow arch overrides for .exit section names

Some archs like ARM store unwind information for .exit.text in sections
with unusual names. As this unwind information refers to .exit.text, it
must not be loaded when .exit.text is not loaded (when CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD
is unset); otherwise, loading a module can fail due to relocation failures.
