drm/i915: Keep user GGTT alive for a minimum of 250ms

Do not allow runtime pm autosuspend to remove userspace GGTT mmaps too
quickly. For example, igt sets the autosuspend delay to 0, and so we
immediately attempt to perform runtime suspend upon releasing the
wakeref. Unfortunately, that involves tearing down GGTT mmaps as they
require an active device.

Override the autosuspend for GGTT mmaps, by keeping the wakeref around
for 250ms after populating the PTE for a fresh mmap.

v2: Prefer refcount_t for its under/overflow error detection
v3: Flush the user runtime autosuspend prior to system system.
