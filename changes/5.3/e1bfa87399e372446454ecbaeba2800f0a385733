x86/mm: Create a workarea in the kernel for SME early encryption

In order for the kernel to be encrypted "in place" during boot, a workarea
outside of the kernel must be used. This SME workarea used during early
encryption of the kernel is situated on a 2MB boundary after the end of
the kernel text, data, etc. sections (_end).

This works well during initial boot of a compressed kernel because of
the relocation used for decompression of the kernel. But when performing
a kexec boot, there's a chance that the SME workarea may not be mapped
by the kexec pagetables or that some of the other data used by kexec
could exist in this range.

Create a section for SME in vmlinux.lds.S. Position it after "_end", which
is after "__end_of_kernel_reserve", so that the memory will be reclaimed
during boot and since this area is all zeroes, it compresses well. This
new section will be part of the kernel image, so kexec will account for it
in pagetable mappings and placement of data after the kernel.

Here's an example of a kernel size without and with the SME section:

	without:
		vmlinux:	36,501,616
		bzImage:	 6,497,344

		100000000-47f37ffff : System RAM
		  1e4000000-1e47677d4 : Kernel code	(0x7677d4)
		  1e47677d5-1e4e2e0bf : Kernel data	(0x6c68ea)
		  1e5074000-1e5372fff : Kernel bss	(0x2fefff)

	with:
		vmlinux:	44,419,408
		bzImage:	 6,503,136

		880000000-c7ff7ffff : System RAM
		  8cf000000-8cf7677d4 : Kernel code	(0x7677d4)
		  8cf7677d5-8cfe2e0bf : Kernel data	(0x6c68ea)
		  8d0074000-8d0372fff : Kernel bss	(0x2fefff)
