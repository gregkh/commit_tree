platform/x86: acer-wmi: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

drivers/platform/x86/acer-wmi.c: In function ‘set_u32’:
drivers/platform/x86/acer-wmi.c:1378:33: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
    if (cap == ACER_CAP_WIRELESS ||

   case ACER_WMID:

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
