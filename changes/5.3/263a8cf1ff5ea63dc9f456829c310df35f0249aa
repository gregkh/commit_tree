drm/i915: Tune down WARN about incorrect VBT TC legacy flag

Looks like VBT contains again the wrong information about a port's TypeC
legacy vs. DP-alt/TBT-alt type. There is no further issues after we
notice this and fix it up, so tune down the WARN to be a a DRM_ERROR.

This also avoids CI tainting the kernel and stopping the test run.

v2:
- Update also code coment accordingly. (Jani)
