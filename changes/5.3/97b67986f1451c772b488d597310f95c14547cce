    fbcon: Make fbcon a built-time depency for fbdev

we have a static dependency between fbcon and fbdev, and we can
replace the indirection through the notifier chain with a function
call.

v2: Sam Ravnborg noticed that mach-pxa/am200epd.c has a notifier too,
and listens to this.

...

Looking at the code it seems to wait for some fb to show up, so that
it can get the framebuffer base address from the fb_info struct. I
suspect his is some firmware fbdev. Then it uses that information to
let the real fbdev driver (metronomefb.c by the looks) get at the
framebuffer memory.

This doesn't looke like it's easy to fix (except by deleting the
entire thing, seems untouched since 2008, we might be able to get away
with that), so let's just stuff a few #ifdef into fb.h and fbmem.c and
cry over them for a bit.
