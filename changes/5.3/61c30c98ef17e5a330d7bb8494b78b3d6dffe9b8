dax: Fix missed wakeup in put_unlocked_entry()

The condition checking whether put_unlocked_entry() needs to wake up
following waiter got broken by commit 23c84eb78375 ("dax: Fix missed
wakeup with PMD faults"). We need to wake the waiter whenever the passed
entry is valid (i.e., non-NULL and not special conflict entry). This
could lead to processes never being woken up when waiting for entry
lock. Fix the condition.
