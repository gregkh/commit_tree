pinctrl: stm32: add suspend/resume management

During power sequence, GPIO hardware registers could be lost if the power
supply is switched off. Each device using pinctrl API is in charge of
managing pins during suspend/resume sequences. But for pins used as gpio or
irq stm32 pinctrl driver has to save the hardware configuration.
