clocksource/drivers/tegra: Replace readl/writel with relaxed versions

The readl/writel functions are inserting memory barrier to ensure that
outstanding memory writes are completed, this results in L2 cache syncing
being done on Tegra20 and Tegra30 which isn't a very cheap operation.
Replace all readl/writel occurrences in the code with the relaxed versions
since there is no need for the memory-access syncing.
