cgroup: freezer: fix frozen state inheritance

If a new child cgroup is created in the frozen cgroup hierarchy
(one or more of ancestor cgroups is frozen), the CGRP_FREEZE cgroup
flag should be set. Otherwise if a process will be attached to the
child cgroup, it won't become frozen.

The problem can be reproduced with the test_cgfreezer_mkdir test.

This is the output before this patch:
  ~/test_freezer
  ok 1 test_cgfreezer_simple
  ok 2 test_cgfreezer_tree
  ok 3 test_cgfreezer_forkbomb
  Cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/cg_test_mkdir_A/cg_test_mkdir_B isn't frozen
  not ok 4 test_cgfreezer_mkdir
  ok 5 test_cgfreezer_rmdir
  ok 6 test_cgfreezer_migrate
  ok 7 test_cgfreezer_ptrace
  ok 8 test_cgfreezer_stopped
  ok 9 test_cgfreezer_ptraced
  ok 10 test_cgfreezer_vfork

And with this patch:
  ~/test_freezer
  ok 1 test_cgfreezer_simple
  ok 2 test_cgfreezer_tree
  ok 3 test_cgfreezer_forkbomb
  ok 4 test_cgfreezer_mkdir
  ok 5 test_cgfreezer_rmdir
  ok 6 test_cgfreezer_migrate
  ok 7 test_cgfreezer_ptrace
  ok 8 test_cgfreezer_stopped
  ok 9 test_cgfreezer_ptraced
  ok 10 test_cgfreezer_vfork
