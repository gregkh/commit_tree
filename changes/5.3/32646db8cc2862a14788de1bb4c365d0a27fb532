Bluetooth: btqca: inject command complete event during fw download

Latest qualcomm chips are not sending an command complete event for
every firmware packet sent to chip. They only respond with a vendor
specific event for the last firmware packet. This optimization will
decrease the BT ON time. Due to this we are seeing a timeout error
message logs on the console during firmware download. Now we are
injecting a command complete event once we receive an vendor specific
event for the last RAM firmware packet.
