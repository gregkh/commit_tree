pwm: Add consumer device link

Add a device link between the PWM consumer and the PWM provider. This
enforces the PWM user to get suspended before the PWM provider. It
allows proper synchronization of suspend/resume sequences: the PWM user
is responsible for properly stopping PWM, before the provider gets
suspended: see [1]. Add the device link in:
- of_pwm_get()
- pwm_get()
- devm_*pwm_get() variants
as it requires a reference to the device for the PWM consumer.
