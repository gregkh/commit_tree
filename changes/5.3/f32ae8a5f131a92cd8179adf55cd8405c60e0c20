net: dsa: qca8k: replace legacy gpio include

This patch replaces the legacy bulk gpio.h include
with the proper gpio/consumer.h variant. This was
caught by the kbuild test robot that was running
into an error because of this.

For more information why linux/gpio.h is bad can be found in:
commit 56a46b6144e7 ("gpio: Clarify that <linux/gpio.h> is legacy")
