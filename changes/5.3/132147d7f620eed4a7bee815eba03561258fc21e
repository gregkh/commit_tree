scsi: megaraid_sas: Add support for High IOPS queues

Aero controllers support balanced performance mode through the ability to
configure queues with different properties.

Reply queues with interrupt coalescing enabled are called "high iops reply
queues" and reply queues with interrupt coalescing disabled are called "low
latency reply queues".

The driver configures a combination of high iops and low latency reply
queues if:

 - HBA is an AERO controller;

 - MSI-X vectors supported by the HBA is 128;

 - Total CPU count in the system more than high iops queue count;

 - Driver is loaded with default max_msix_vectors module parameter; and

 - System booted in non-kdump mode.
