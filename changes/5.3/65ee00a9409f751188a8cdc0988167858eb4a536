net: nexthop uapi

New UAPI for nexthops as standalone objects:
- defines netlink ancillary header, struct nhmsg
- RTM commands for nexthop objects, RTM_*NEXTHOP,
- RTNLGRP for nexthop notifications, RTNLGRP_NEXTHOP,
- Attributes for creating nexthops, NHA_*
- Attribute for route specs to specify a nexthop by id, RTA_NH_ID.

The nexthop attributes and semantics follow the route and RTA ones for
device, gateway and lwt encap. Unique to nexthop objects are a blackhole
and a group which contains references to other nexthop objects. With the
exception of blackhole and group, nexthop objects MUST contain a device.
Gateway and encap are optional. Nexthop groups can only reference other
pre-existing nexthops by id. If the NHA_ID attribute is present that id
is used for the nexthop. If not specified, one is auto assigned.

Dump requests can include attributes:
- NHA_GROUPS to return only nexthop groups,
- NHA_MASTER to limit dumps to nexthops with devices enslaved to the
  given master (e.g., VRF)
- NHA_OIF to limit dumps to nexthops using given device

nlmsg_route_perms in selinux code is updated for the new RTM comands.
