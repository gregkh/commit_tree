drm/amd/display: Calculate link bandwidth in a common function

[why]
Currently link bandwidth is calculated in various places using the same
multi-step formula. Doing this in one common place makes sure the same
formula will indeed be applied to all link bandwidth calculations.
It also makes it possible to apply link-setting-specific adjustments
that affect effective link bandwidth.

[how]
Replace all implementations of link bandwidth calculation with a call
to a function.
