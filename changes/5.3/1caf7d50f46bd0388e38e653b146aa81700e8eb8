pidfd: Add warning if exit_state is 0 during notification

Previously a condition got missed where the pidfd waiters are awakened
before the exit_state gets set. This can result in a missed notification
[1] and the polling thread waiting forever.

It is fixed now, however it would be nice to avoid this kind of issue
going unnoticed in the future. So just add a warning to catch it in the
future.
