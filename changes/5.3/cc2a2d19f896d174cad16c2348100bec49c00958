docs: watchdog: convert docs to ReST and rename to *.rst

Convert those documents and prepare them to be part of the kernel
API book, as most of the stuff there are related to the
Kernel interfaces.

Still, in the future, it would make sense to split the docs,
as some of the stuff is clearly focused on sysadmin tasks.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fix tables markups;
  - add some lists markups;
  - mark literal blocks;
  - adjust title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
