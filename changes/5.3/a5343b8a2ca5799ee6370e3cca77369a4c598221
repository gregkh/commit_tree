drm/scheduler: Add flag to hint the release of guilty job.

Problem:
Sched thread's cleanup function races against TO handler
and removes the guilty job from mirror list and we
have no way of differentiating if the job was removed from within the
TO handler or from the sched thread's clean-up function.

Fix:
Add a flag to scheduler to hint the TO handler that the guilty job needs
to be explicitly released.

v2: whitespace fix
