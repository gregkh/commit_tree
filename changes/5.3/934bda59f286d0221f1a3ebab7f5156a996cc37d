powerpc/pseries/hvconsole: Fix stack overread via udbg

While developing KASAN for 64-bit book3s, I hit the following stack
over-read.

It occurs because the hypercall to put characters onto the terminal
takes 2 longs (128 bits/16 bytes) of characters at a time, and so
hvc_put_chars() would unconditionally copy 16 bytes from the argument
buffer, regardless of supplied length. However, udbg_hvc_putc() can
call hvc_put_chars() with a single-byte buffer, leading to the error.

Document that a 16-byte buffer is requred, and provide it in udbg.
