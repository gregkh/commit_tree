qed: Add llh ppfid interface and 100g support for offload protocols

This patch refactors the current llh implementation. It exposes a hw
resource called ppfid (port-pfid) and implements an API for configuring
the resource. Default configuration which was used until now limited
the number of filters per PF and did not support engine affinity per
protocol. The new API enables allocating more filter rules per PF and
enables affinitizing protocol packets to a certain engine which
enables full 100g protocol offload support.
