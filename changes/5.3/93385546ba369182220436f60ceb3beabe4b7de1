ARM: dts: imx6qdl-sabresd: Assign corresponding power supply for LDOs

On i.MX6Q/DL SabreSD board, vgen5 supplies vdd1p1/vdd2p5 LDO and
sw2 supplies vdd3p0 LDO, this patch assigns corresponding power
supply for vdd1p1/vdd2p5/vdd3p0 to avoid confusion by below log:

vdd1p1: supplied by regulator-dummy
vdd3p0: supplied by regulator-dummy
vdd2p5: supplied by regulator-dummy

With this patch, the power supply is more accurate:

vdd1p1: supplied by VGEN5
vdd3p0: supplied by SW2
vdd2p5: supplied by VGEN5
