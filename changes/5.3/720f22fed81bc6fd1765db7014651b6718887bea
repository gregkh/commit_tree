net: sched: refactor reinsert action

The TC_ACT_REINSERT return type was added as an in-kernel only option to
allow a packet ingress or egress redirect. This is used to avoid
unnecessary skb clones in situations where they are not required. If a TC
hook returns this code then the packet is 'reinserted' and no skb consume
is carried out as no clone took place.

This return type is only used in act_mirred. Rather than have the reinsert
called from the main datapath, call it directly in act_mirred. Instead of
returning TC_ACT_REINSERT, change the type to the new TC_ACT_CONSUMED
which tells the caller that the packet has been stolen by another process
and that no consume call is required.

Moving all redirect calls to the act_mirred code is in preparation for
tracking recursion created by act_mirred.
