RDMA/bnxt_re: Honor vlan_id in GID entry comparison

A GID entry consists of GID, vlan, netdev and smac.  Extend GID duplicate
check comparisons to consider vlan_id as well to support IPv6 VLAN based
link local addresses. Introduce a new structure (bnxt_qplib_gid_info) to
hold gid and vlan_id information.
