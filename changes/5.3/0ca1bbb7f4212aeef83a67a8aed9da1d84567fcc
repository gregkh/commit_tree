selftests: netfilter: extend flowtable test script for ipsec

'flow offload' expression should not offload flows that will be subject
to ipsec, but it does.

This results in a connectivity blackhole for the affected flows -- first
packets will go through (offload happens after established state is
reached), but all remaining ones bypass ipsec encryption and are thus
discarded by the peer.

This can be worked around by adding "rt ipsec exists accept"
before the 'flow offload' rule matches.

This test case will fail, support for such flows is added in
next patch.
