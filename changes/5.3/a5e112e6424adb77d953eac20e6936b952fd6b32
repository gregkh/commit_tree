cgroup: add cgroup_parse_float()

cgroup already uses floating point for percent[ile] numbers and there
are several controllers which want to take them as input.  Add a
generic parse helper to handle inputs.

Update the interface convention documentation about the use of
percentage numbers.  While at it, also clarify the default time unit.
