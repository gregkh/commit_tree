nvme-trace: do not export nvme_trace_disk_name

nvme_trace_disk_name() is now already being invoked with the function
prototype in trace.h.  We don't need to export this symbol at all.

The following patches are going to provide target-side trace feature
with the exactly same function with this so that this patch removes the
EXPORT_SYMBOL() for this function.
