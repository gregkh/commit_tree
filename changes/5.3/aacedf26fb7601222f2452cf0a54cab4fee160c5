sched/core: Optimize try_to_wake_up() for local wakeups

Jens reported that significant performance can be had on some block
workloads by special casing local wakeups. That is, wakeups on the
current task before it schedules out.

Given something like the normal wait pattern:

	for (;;) {
		set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);

		if (cond)
			break;

		schedule();
	}
	__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);

Any wakeup (on this CPU) after set_current_state() and before
schedule() would benefit from this.

Normal wakeups take p->pi_lock, which serializes wakeups to the same
task. By eliding that we gain concurrency on:

 - ttwu_stat(); we already had concurrency on rq stats, this now also
   brings it to task stats. -ENOCARE

 - tracepoints; it is now possible to get multiple instances of
   trace_sched_waking() (and possibly trace_sched_wakeup()) for the
   same task. Tracers will have to learn to cope.

Furthermore, p->pi_lock is used by set_special_state(), to order
against TASK_RUNNING stores from other CPUs. But since this is
strictly CPU local, we don't need the lock, and set_special_state()'s
disabling of IRQs is sufficient.

After the normal wakeup takes p->pi_lock it issues
smp_mb__after_spinlock(), in order to ensure the woken task must
observe prior stores before we observe the p->state. If this is CPU
local, this will be satisfied with a compiler barrier, and we rely on
try_to_wake_up() being a funcation call, which implies such.

Since, when 'p == current', 'p->on_rq' must be true, the normal wakeup
would continue into the ttwu_remote() branch, which normally is
concerned with exactly this wakeup scenario, except from a remote CPU.
IOW we're waking a task that is still running. In this case, we can
trivially avoid taking rq->lock, all that's left from this is to set
p->state.

This then yields an extremely simple and fast path for 'p == current'.
