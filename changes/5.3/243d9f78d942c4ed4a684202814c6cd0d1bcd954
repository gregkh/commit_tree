block: code cleanup queue_poll_stat_show()

This is a pure code cleanup patch and doesn't change any functionality.
Having multiple coding styles in the code creates confusion when
someone tries to add a new code.

Make queue_poll_stat_show() consistent by adding spaces around binary
operators with the rest of the code.
