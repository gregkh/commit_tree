scsi: lpfc: Fix hardlockup in scsi_cmd_iocb_cmpl

There is a race condition with the abort handler declaring a waitq
item on it's stack, followed by a timeout in the abort handler that
has it give up on the abort return to its caller. When the io is
finally aborted and its completion handler called, it references
the waitq element that the abort_handler set up, which is no longer
valid resulting in a deadlock.

Fix by clearing the waitq reference, under lock, when the abort
handler timeout gives up. Have the completion handler validate the
waitq before referencing it.
