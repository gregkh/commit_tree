block, bfq: Init saved_wr_start_at_switch_to_srt in unlikely case

Some debug code suggested by Paolo was tripping when I did reboot
stress tests.  Specifically in bfq_bfqq_resume_state()
"bic->saved_wr_start_at_switch_to_srt" was later than the current
value of "jiffies".  A bit of debugging showed that
"bic->saved_wr_start_at_switch_to_srt" was actually 0 and a bit more
debugging showed that was because we had run through the "unlikely"
case in the bfq_bfqq_save_state() function.

Let's init "saved_wr_start_at_switch_to_srt" in the unlikely case to
something sane.

NOTE: this fixes no known real-world errors.
