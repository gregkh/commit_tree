rhashtable: Add rht_ptr_rcu and improve rht_ptr

This patch moves common code between rht_ptr and rht_ptr_exclusive
into __rht_ptr.  It also adds a new helper rht_ptr_rcu exclusively
for the RCU case.  This way rht_ptr becomes a lock-only construct
so we can use the lighter rcu_dereference_protected primitive.
