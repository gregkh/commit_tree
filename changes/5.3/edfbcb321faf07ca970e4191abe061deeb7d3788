usb: add a hcd_uses_dma helper

The USB buffer allocation code is the only place in the usb core (and in
fact the whole kernel) that uses is_device_dma_capable, while the URB
mapping code uses the uses_dma flag in struct usb_bus.  Switch the buffer
allocation to use the uses_dma flag used by the rest of the USB code,
and create a helper in hcd.h that checks this flag as well as the
CONFIG_HAS_DMA to simplify the caller a bit.
