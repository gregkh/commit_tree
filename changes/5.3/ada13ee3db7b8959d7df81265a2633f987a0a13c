net: hns3: add handshake with hardware while doing reset

When reset happens, the hardware reset should begin after the
driver has finished its preparatory work, otherwise it may cause
some hardware error.

Before Hardware's reset, it will wait for the driver to write
bit HCLGE_NIC_CMQ_ENABLE of register HCLGE_NIC_CSQ_DEPTH_REG
to 1, while the driver finishes its preparatory work will do that.
BTW, since some cases this register will be cleared, so it needs
some sync time before driver's writing.
