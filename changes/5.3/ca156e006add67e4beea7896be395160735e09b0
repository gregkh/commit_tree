libata: don't request sense data on !ZAC ATA devices

ZAC support added sense data requesting on error for both ZAC and ATA
devices. This seems to cause erratic error handling behaviors on some
SSDs where the device reports sense data availability and then
delivers the wrong content making EH take the wrong actions.  The
failure mode was sporadic on a LITE-ON ssd and couldn't be reliably
reproduced.

There is no value in requesting sense data from non-ZAC ATA devices
while there's a significant risk of introducing EH misbehaviors which
are difficult to reproduce and fix.  Let's do the sense data dancing
only for ZAC devices.
