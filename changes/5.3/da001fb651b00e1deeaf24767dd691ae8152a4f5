crypto: atmel-i2c - add support for SHA204A random number generator

The Linaro/96boards Secure96 mezzanine contains (among other things)
an Atmel SHA204A symmetric crypto processor. This chip implements a
number of different functionalities, but one that is highly useful
for many different 96boards platforms is the random number generator.

So let's implement a driver for the SHA204A, and for the time being,
implement support for the random number generator only.
