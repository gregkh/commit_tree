torture: Add --trust-make to suppress "make clean"

The current rcutorture scripts unconditionally do "make clean", which is
a good way of getting the needed testing done despite any imperfections in
Makefile dependency tracking.  However, this can be a bit irritating when
repeatedly running a single scenario after small changes, for example,
when debugging a problem that affects only a single scenario.  This commit
therefore adds a --trust-make argument that suppresses the "make clean".

Even when using ccache, this speeds up kernel builds by up to almost an
order of magnitude on my laptop.
