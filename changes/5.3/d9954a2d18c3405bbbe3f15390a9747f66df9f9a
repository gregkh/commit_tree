scsi: lpfc: Fix oops when driver is loaded with 1 interrupt vector

The driver was coded expecting enough hardware queues and interrupt vectors
such that at least there was one per socket. In the case where there were
fewer than sockets, cpus were left unassigned thus null pointers.

Rework the affinity mappings. Map settings for the cpu's that are in the
irq cpu mask. For each cpu not in the mask, map to another cpu that does
have a mask. Choice of the "other" cpu will attempt to map to the same cpu
but differing hyperthread, or cpu within in same core, or cpu within same
socket, or finally cpu in the base socket.
