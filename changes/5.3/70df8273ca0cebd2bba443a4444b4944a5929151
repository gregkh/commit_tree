drm/amdkfd: fix cp hang in eviction

The cp hang occurs in OCL conformance test only on supermicro
platform which has 40 cores and the test generates 40 threads.
The root cause is race condition in non-protected flags.

The fix is to add flags of is_evicted and is_active(init_mqd())
into protected area.
