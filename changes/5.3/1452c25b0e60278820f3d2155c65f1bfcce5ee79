drm: Add helpers to kick off self refresh mode in drivers

This patch adds a new drm helper library to help drivers implement
self refresh. Drivers choosing to use it will register crtcs and
will receive callbacks when it's time to enter or exit self refresh
mode.

In its current form, it has a timer which will trigger after a
driver-specified amount of inactivity. When the timer triggers, the
helpers will submit a new atomic commit to shut the refreshing pipe
off. On the next atomic commit, the drm core will revert the self
refresh state and bring everything back up to be actively driven.

From the driver's perspective, this works like a regular disable/enable
cycle. The driver need only check the 'self_refresh_active' state in
crtc_state. It should initiate self refresh mode on the panel and enter
an off or low-power state.

Changes in v2:
- s/psr/self_refresh/ (Daniel)
- integrated the psr exit into the commit that wakes it up (Jose/Daniel)
- made the psr state per-crtc (Jose/Daniel)
Changes in v3:
- Remove the self_refresh_(active|changed) from connector state (Daniel)
- Simplify loop in drm_self_refresh_helper_alter_state (Daniel)
- Improve self_refresh_aware comment (Daniel)
- s/self_refresh_state/self_refresh_data/ (Daniel)
Changes in v4:
- Move docbook location below panel (Daniel)
- Improve docbook with references and more detailed explanation (Daniel)
- Instead of register/unregister, use init/cleanup (Daniel)
Changes in v5:
- Resolved conflict in drm_atomic_helper.c #include block
- Resolved conflict in rst with HDCP helper docs
Changes in v6:
- Fix include ordering, clean up forward declarations (Sam)
