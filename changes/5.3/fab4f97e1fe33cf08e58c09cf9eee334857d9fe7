RDMA/siw: Fix SGL mapping issues

All user level and most in-kernel applications submit WQEs
where the SG list entries are all of a single type.
iSER in particular, however, will send us WQEs with mixed SG
types: sge[0] = kernel buffer, sge[1] = PBL region.
Check and set is_kva on each SG entry individually instead of
assuming the first SGE type carries through to the last.
This fixes iSER over siw.
