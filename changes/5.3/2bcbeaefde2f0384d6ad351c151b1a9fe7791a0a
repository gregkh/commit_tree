mm/hmm: always return EBUSY for invalid ranges in hmm_range_{fault,snapshot}

We should not have two different error codes for the same
condition. EAGAIN must be reserved for the FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY retry
case and signals to the caller that the mmap_sem has been unlocked.

Use EBUSY for the !valid case so that callers can get the locking right.
