lib/vsprintf: Reinstate printing of legacy clock IDs

When using the legacy clock framework, clock pointers are no longer
printed as IDs, as the !CONFIG_COMMON_CLK case was accidentally
considered an error case.

Fix this by reverting to the old behavior, which allows to distinguish
clocks by ID, as the legacy clock framework does not store names with
clocks.
