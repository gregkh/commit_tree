configfs_register_group() shouldn't be (and isn't) called in rmdirable parts

revert cc57c07343bd "configfs: fix registered group removal"
It was an attempt to handle something that fundamentally doesn't
work - configfs_register_group() should never be done in a part
of tree that can be rmdir'ed.  And in mainline it never had been,
so let's not borrow trouble; the fix was racy anyway, it would take
a lot more to make that work and desired semantics is not clear.
