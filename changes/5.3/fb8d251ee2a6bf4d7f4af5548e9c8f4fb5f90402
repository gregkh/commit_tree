bpf: extend is_branch_taken to registers

This patch extends is_branch_taken() logic from JMP+K instructions
to JMP+X instructions.
Conditional branches are often done when src and dst registers
contain known scalars. In such case the verifier can follow
the branch that is going to be taken when program executes.
That speeds up the verification and is essential feature to support
bounded loops.
