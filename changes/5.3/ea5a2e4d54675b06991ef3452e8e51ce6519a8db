bus: ti-sysc: Do rstctrl reset handling in two phases

We need to deassert rstctrl resets before enabling clocks to avoid clock
"failed to enable" errors. For asserting rstctrl reset, the clocks need
to be enabled.

As the reset controller status is not available for arrays, let's use
devm_reset_control_get_optional() so we can get the status after reset.

Note that depends on a proper PRM rstctrl driver, so far I've only
tested this with earlier reset-simple patches.
