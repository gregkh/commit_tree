platform/x86: wmi: Add function to get _UID of WMI device

Add a new function to acpi.h / wmi.c that returns _UID of the ACPI WMI
device. For example, it returns "ATK" for the following declaration in
DSDT:
Device (ATKD)
{
    Name (_HID, "PNP0C14" /* Windows Management Instrumentation Device */)
      // _HID: Hardware ID
    Name (_UID, "ATK")  // _UID: Unique ID
    ..

Generally, it is possible that multiple PNP0C14 ACPI devices are present in
the system as mentioned in the commit message of commit bff431e49ff5
("ACPI: WMI: Add ACPI-WMI mapping driver").

Therefore the _UID is returned for a specific ACPI device that declares the
given GUID, to which it is also mapped by other methods of wmi module.
