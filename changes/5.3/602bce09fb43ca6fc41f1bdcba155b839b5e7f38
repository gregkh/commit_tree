perf augmented_raw_syscalls: Move reading filename to the loop

Almost there, next step is to copy more than one filename payload.

Probably to read syscall arg structs, etc we'll need just a variation of
this that will decide what to use, if probe_read_str() or plain
probe_read for structs, i.e. fixed size.
