kbuild: remove headers_{install,check}_all

headers_install_all does not make much sense any more because different
architectures export different set of uapi/linux/ headers. As you see
in include/uapi/linux/Kbuild, the installation of a.out.h, kvm.h, and
kvm_para.h is arch-dependent. So, headers_install_all repeats the
installation/removal of them.

If somebody really thinks it is useful to do headers_install for all
architectures, it would be possible by small shell-scripting, but
the top Makefile does not have to provide entry targets just for that
purpose.
