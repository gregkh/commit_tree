clk: bcm283x: add driver interfacing with Raspberry Pi's firmware

Raspberry Pi's firmware offers an interface though which update it's
clock's frequencies. This is specially useful in order to change the CPU
clock (pllb_arm) which is 'owned' by the firmware and we're unable to
scale using the register interface provided by clk-bcm2835.
