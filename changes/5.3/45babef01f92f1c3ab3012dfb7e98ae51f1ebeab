drm/rockchip: Change the scl_vop_cal_scl_fac to pass drm_format_info

The Rockchip VOP driver has a function, scl_vop_cal_scl_fac, that will
lookup the drm_format_info structure from the fourcc passed to it by its
caller.

However, its only caller already derefences the drm_format_info structure
it has access to to retrieve that fourcc. Change the prototype of that
function to pass the drm_format_info structure directly, removing the need
for an extra lookup.
