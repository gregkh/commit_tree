signal: Remove the signal number and task parameters from force_sig_info

force_sig_info always delivers to the current task and the signal
parameter always matches info.si_signo.  So remove those parameters to
make it a simpler less error prone interface, and to make it clear
that none of the callers are doing anything clever.

This guarantees that force_sig_info will not grow any new buggy
callers that attempt to call force_sig on a non-current task, or that
pass an signal number that does not match info.si_signo.
