drm/amd/display: Properly set DCF clock

[Why]
If num_states == 0 we did update_bound_box which doesn't updated any max
clocks if num_states == 0, therefore we need to do cap_soc_clocks
instead, also SMU cannot set DCF clock to a higher than or equal to freq
than SOC clock

[How]
Add a num_states != 0 check for update_bounding_box to be run, and after
we run get_maximum_sustainable_clocks we now check if the reported max
value of DCF is higher than SOC and if necessary set it to 1000
(becomes 1 after division by 1000) lower than SOC
