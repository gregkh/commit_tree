srcu: Remove unused vmlinux srcu linker entries

The SRCU for modules optimization (commit title "srcu: Allocate per-CPU
data for DEFINE_SRCU() in modules") introduced vmlinux linker entries
which is unused since it applies only to the built-in vmlinux. So remove
it to prevent any space usage due to the 8 byte alignment it added.
vmlinux.lds.h has no effect on module loading and is not used for
building the module object, so the changes were not needed in the first
place since the optimization is specific to modules.

Tested with SRCU torture_type and rcutorture. Put prints in module
loader to confirm it is able to find and initialize the srcu structures.
