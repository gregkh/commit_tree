perf tools: Increase MAX_NR_CPUS and MAX_CACHES

Attempting to profile 1024 or more CPUs with perf causes two errors:

  perf record -a
  [ perf record: Woken up X times to write data ]
  way too many cpu caches..
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote X MB perf.data (X samples) ]

  perf report -C 1024
  Error: failed to set  cpu bitmap
  Requested CPU 1024 too large. Consider raising MAX_NR_CPUS

  Increasing MAX_NR_CPUS from 1024 to 2048 and redefining MAX_CACHES as
  MAX_NR_CPUS * 4 returns normal functionality to perf:

  perf record -a
  [ perf record: Woken up X times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote X MB perf.data (X samples) ]

  perf report -C 1024
