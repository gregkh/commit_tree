net: sched: remove NET_CLS_IND config option

This config option makes only couple of lines optional.
Two small helpers and an int in couple of cls structs.

Remove the config option and always compile this in.
This saves the user from unexpected surprises when he adds
a filter with ingress device match which is silently ignored
in case the config option is not set.
