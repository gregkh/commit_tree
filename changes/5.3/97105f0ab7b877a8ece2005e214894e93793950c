mm: vmalloc: show number of vmalloc pages in /proc/meminfo

Vmalloc() is getting more and more used these days (kernel stacks, bpf and
percpu allocator are new top users), and the total % of memory consumed by
vmalloc() can be pretty significant and changes dynamically.

/proc/meminfo is the best place to display this information: its top goal
is to show top consumers of the memory.

Since the VmallocUsed field in /proc/meminfo is not in use for quite a
long time (it has been defined to 0 by a5ad88ce8c7f ("mm: get rid of
'vmalloc_info' from /proc/meminfo")), let's reuse it for showing the
actual physical memory consumption of vmalloc().
