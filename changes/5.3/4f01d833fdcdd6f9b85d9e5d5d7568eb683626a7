serial: stm32: fix rx error handling

- Fixes parity and framing error bit by clearing parity and framing error
  flag. The current implementation doesn't clear the error bits when an
  error is detected.
- Fixes the incorrect name of framing error clearing flag in header file.
- Fixes misalignement between data frame and errors status. The status
  read for "n" frame was the status of "n+1" frame".
- Fixes break detection was not triggered by the expected register.
