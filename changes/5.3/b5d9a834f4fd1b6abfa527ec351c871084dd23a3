net/tls: don't clear TX resync flag on error

Introduce a return code for the tls_dev_resync callback.

When the driver TX resync fails, kernel can retry the resync again
until it succeeds.  This prevents drivers from attempting to offload
TLS packets if the connection is known to be out of sync.

We don't worry about the RX resync since they will be retried naturally
as more encrypted records get received.
