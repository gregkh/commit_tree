ice: Cleanup an unnecessary variable initialization

Commit 3463688e6ced ("ice: Add more validation in ice_vc_cfg_irq_map_msg")
added an assignment of vsi making the assignment during declaration
unnecessary.

Also, cleanup the declaration and assignment of irqmap_info to not use two
lines in the variable declaration section.
