s390/setup: adjust start_code of init_mm to _text

After some investigation it doesn't look like init_mm fields
start_code/end_code are used anywhere besides potentially in dump_mm for
debugging purposes. Originally the value of 0 for start_code reflected
the presence of lowcore and early boot code. But with kaslr in place
start_code/end_code range should not span over unoccupied by the code
segment memory. So, adjust init_mm start_code to point at the beginning
of the code segment like other architectures do it.
