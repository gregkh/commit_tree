net/mac80211: move WEP handling to ARC4 library interface

The WEP code in the mac80211 subsystem currently uses the crypto
API to access the arc4 (RC4) cipher, which is overly complicated,
and doesn't really have an upside in this particular case, since
ciphers are always synchronous and therefore always implemented in
software. Given that we have no accelerated software implementations
either, it is much more straightforward to invoke a generic library
interface directly.
