dma-mapping: fix page attributes for dma_mmap_*

All the way back to introducing dma_common_mmap we've defaulted to mark
the pages as uncached.  But this is wrong for DMA coherent devices.
Later on DMA_ATTR_WRITE_COMBINE also got incorrect treatment as that
flag is only treated special on the alloc side for non-coherent devices.

Introduce a new dma_pgprot helper that deals with the check for coherent
devices so that only the remapping cases ever reach arch_dma_mmap_pgprot
and we thus ensure no aliasing of page attributes happens, which makes
the powerpc version of arch_dma_mmap_pgprot obsolete and simplifies the
remaining ones.

Note that this means arch_dma_mmap_pgprot is a bit misnamed now, but
we'll phase it out soon.
