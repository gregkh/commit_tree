ASoC: SOF: Use struct_size() in kmemdup()

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace code of the following form:

sizeof(*w) + sizeof(struct sof_ipc_window_elem) * w->num_windows

with:

struct_size(w, window, w->num_windows)

Notice that variable size is unnecessary, hence it is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
