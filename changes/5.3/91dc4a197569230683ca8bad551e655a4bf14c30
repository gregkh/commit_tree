s390/dasd: Add new ioctl to release space

Userspace tools might have the need to release space for Extent Space
Efficient (ESE) volumes when working with such a device.

Provide the necessarry interface for such a task by implementing a new
ioctl BIODASDRAS. The ioctl uses the format_data_t data structure for
data input:

typedef struct format_data_t {
        unsigned int start_unit;        /* from track */
        unsigned int stop_unit;         /* to track */
        unsigned int blksize;           /* sectorsize */
        unsigned int intensity;
} format_data_t;

If the intensity is set to 0x40, start_unit and stop_unit are ignored
and space for the entire volume is released. Otherwise, if intensity is
set to 0, the respective range is released (if possible).
