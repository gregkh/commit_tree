perf intel-pt: Add new packets for PEBS via PT

Add 3 new packets to supports PEBS via PT, namely Block Begin Packet
(BBP), Block Item Packet (BIP) and Block End Packet (BEP). PEBS data is
encoded into multiple BIP packets that come between BBP and BEP. The BEP
packet might be associated with a FUP packet. That is indicated by using
a separate packet type (INTEL_PT_BEP_IP) similar to other packets types
with the _IP suffix.

Refer to the Intel SDM for more information about PEBS via PT:

  May 2019 version: Vol. 3B 18.5.5.2 PEBS output to IntelÂ® Processor Trace

Decoding of BIP packets conflicts with single-byte TNT packets. Since
BIP packets only occur in the context of a block (i.e. between BBP and
BEP), that context must be recorded and passed to the packet decoder.
