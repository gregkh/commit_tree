lib/vdso/32: Provide legacy syscall fallbacks

To address the regression which causes seccomp to deny applications the
access to clock_gettime64() and clock_getres64() syscalls because they
are not enabled in the existing filters.

That trips over the fact that 32bit VDSOs use the new clock_gettime64() and
clock_getres64() syscalls in the fallback path.

Add a conditional to invoke the 32bit legacy fallback syscalls instead of
the new 64bit variants. The conditional can go away once all architectures
are converted.
