media: aspeed: remove checking of VE_INTERRUPT_CAPTURE_COMPLETE

VE_INTERRUPT_CAPTURE_COMPLETE and VE_INTERRUPT_COMP_COMPLETE are
not set at the same time but the current interrupt handling
mechanism of this driver doesn't clear the interrupt flag until
both two are set, and this behavior causes unnecessary interrupt
handler calls. In fact, this driver provides JPEG format only so
taking care of the VE_INTERRUPT_COMP_COMPLETE is enough for getting
compressed image frame so this commit gets rid of the
VE_INTERRUPT_CAPTURE_COMPLETE checking logic to simplify the logic.
Handling of VE_INTERRUPT_CAPTURE_COMPLETE could be added back later
when it's actually needed.
