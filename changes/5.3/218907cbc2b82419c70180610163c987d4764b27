KVM: arm/arm64: Remove pmc->bitmask

We currently use pmc->bitmask to determine the width of the pmc - however
it's superfluous as the pmc index already describes if the pmc is a cycle
counter or event counter. The architecture clearly describes the widths of
these counters.

Let's remove the bitmask to simplify the code.
