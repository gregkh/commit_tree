floppy: fix out-of-bounds read in next_valid_format

This fixes a global out-of-bounds read access in the next_valid_format
function of the floppy driver.

The values from autodetect field of the struct floppy_drive_params are
used as indices for the floppy_type array in the next_valid_format
function 'floppy_type[DP->autodetect[probed_format]].sect'.

To trigger the bug, one could use a value out of range and set the drive
parameters with the FDSETDRVPRM ioctl.  A floppy disk is not required to
be inserted.

CAP_SYS_ADMIN is required to call FDSETDRVPRM.

The patch adds the check for values of the autodetect field to be in the
'0 <= x < ARRAY_SIZE(floppy_type)' range of the floppy_type array indices.

The bug was found by syzkaller.
