xhci: Fix crash if scatter gather is used with Immediate Data Transfer (IDT).

A second regression was found in the immediate data transfer (IDT)
support which was added to 5.2 kernel

IDT is used to transfer small amounts of data (up to 8 bytes) in the
field normally used for data dma address, thus avoiding dma mapping.

If the data was not already dma mapped, then IDT support assumed data was
in urb->transfer_buffer, and did not take into accound that even
small amounts of data (8 bytes) can be in a scatterlist instead.

This caused a NULL pointer dereference when sg_dma_len() was used
with non-dma mapped data.

Solve this by not using IDT if scatter gather buffer list is used.
