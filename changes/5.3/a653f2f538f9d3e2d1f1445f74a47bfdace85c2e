net: dsa: qca8k: introduce reset via gpio feature

The QCA8337(N) has a RESETn signal on Pin B42 that
triggers a chip reset if the line is pulled low.
The datasheet says that: "The active low duration
must be greater than 10 ms".

This can hopefully fix some of the issues related
to pin strapping in OpenWrt for the EA8500 which
suffers from detection issues after a SoC reset.

Please note that the qca8k_probe() function does
currently require to read the chip's revision
register for identification purposes.
