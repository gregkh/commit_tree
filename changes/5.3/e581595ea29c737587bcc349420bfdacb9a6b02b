ocfs: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

Also, because there is no need to save the file dentry, remove all of
the variables that were being saved, and just recursively delete the
whole directory when shutting down, saving a lot of logic and local
variables.
