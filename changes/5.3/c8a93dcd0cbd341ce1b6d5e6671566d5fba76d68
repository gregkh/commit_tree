USB: atm: ueagle-atm.c: remove redundant license text

Now that we have the correct SPDX tag for the ueagle-atm.c file, the
wall of "boiler-plate" text is not needed.

This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
needed.

No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.
