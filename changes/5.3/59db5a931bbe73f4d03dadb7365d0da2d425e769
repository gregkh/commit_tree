scsi: megaraid_sas: Handle sequence JBOD map failure at driver level

Issue: This issue is applicable to scenario when JBOD sequence map is
unavailable (memory allocation for JBOD sequence map failed) to driver but
feature is supported by firmware.  If the driver sends a JBOD IO by not
adding 255 (MAX_PHYSICAL_DEVICES - 1) to device ID when underlying firmware
supports JBOD sequence map, it will lead to the IO failure.

Fix: For JBOD IOs, driver will not use the RAID map to fetch the devhandle
if JBOD sequence map is unavailable. Driver will set Devhandle to 0xffff
and Target ID to 'device ID + 255 (MAX_PHYSICAL_DEVICES - 1)'.
