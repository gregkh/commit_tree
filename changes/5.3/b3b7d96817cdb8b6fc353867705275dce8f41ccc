media: coda: increment sequence offset for the last returned frame

If no more frames are decoded in bitstream end mode, and a previously
decoded frame has been returned, the firmware still increments the frame
number. To avoid a sequence number mismatch after decoder restart,
increment the sequence_offset correction parameter.
