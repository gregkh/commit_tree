vsock/virtio: fix flush of works during the .remove()

This patch moves the flush of works after vdev->config->del_vqs(vdev),
because we need to be sure that no workers run before to free the
'vsock' object.

Since we stopped the workers using the [tx|rx|event]_run flags,
we are sure no one is accessing the device while we are calling
vdev->config->reset(vdev), so we can safely move the workers' flush.

Before the vdev->config->del_vqs(vdev), workers can be scheduled
by VQ callbacks, so we must flush them after del_vqs(), to avoid
use-after-free of 'vsock' object.
