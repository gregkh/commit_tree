docs: s390: unify and update s390dbf kdocs at debug.c

For non-static-inlines, debug.c already had non-compliant function
header docs. So move the pure prototype kdocs of
("s390: include/asm/debug.h add kerneldoc markups")
from debug.h to debug.c and merge them with the old function docs.
Also, I had the impression that kdoc typically is at the implementation
in the compile unit rather than at the prototype in the header file.

While at it, update the short kdoc description to distinguish the
different functions. And a few more consistency cleanups.

Added a new kdoc for debug_set_critical() since debug.h comments it
as part of the API.
