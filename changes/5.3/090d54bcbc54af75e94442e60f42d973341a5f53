Revert "x86/paravirt: Set up the virt_spin_lock_key after static keys get initialized"

This reverts commit ca5d376e17072c1b60c3fee66f3be58ef018952d.

Commit 8990cac6e5ea ("x86/jump_label: Initialize static branching
early") adds jump_label_init() call in setup_arch() to make static
keys initialized early, so we could use the original simpler code
again.
