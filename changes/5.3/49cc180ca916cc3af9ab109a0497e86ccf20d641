btrfs: raid56: allow the exact minimum number of devices for balance convert

The minimum number of devices for RAID5 is 2, though this is only a bit
expensive RAID1, and for RAID6 it's 3, which is a triple copy that works
only 3 devices.

mkfs.btrfs allows that and mounting such filesystem also works, so the
conversion via balance filters is inconsistent with the others and we
should not prevent it.
