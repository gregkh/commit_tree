Staging: fbtft: Fix GPIO handling

Commit c440eee1a7a1 ("Staging: fbtft: Switch to the gpio descriptor
interface") breaks GPIO handling. In several places, checks to only set
a GPIO if it was configured ended up backwards.
I have tested this fix. The fixed driver works with a ili9486
display connected to a raspberry pi via SPI.
