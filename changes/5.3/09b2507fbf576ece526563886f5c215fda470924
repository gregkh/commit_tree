clocksource/drivers/tegra: Set and use timer's period

The of_clk structure has a period field that is set up initially by
timer_of_clk_init(), that period value need to be adjusted for a case of
TIMER1-9 that are running at a fixed rate that doesn't match the clock's
rate. Note that the period value is currently used only by some of the
clocksource drivers internally and hence this is just a minor cleanup
change that doesn't fix anything.
