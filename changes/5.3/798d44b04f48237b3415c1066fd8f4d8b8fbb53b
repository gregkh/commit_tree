scsi: megaraid_sas: Don't send FPIO to RL Bypass queue

Firmware does not expect FastPath IO sent through Region Lock Bypass queue.
Though firmware never exposes such settings when fastpath IO can be sent to
RL bypass queue but it's safer to remove dead code which directs fastpath
IO to RL Bypass queue.
