drm/amd/display: CS_TFM_1D only applied post EOTF

[Why]
There's some unnecessary mem allocation for CS_TFM_ID. What's worse, it
depends on LUT size and since it's 4K for CS_TFM_1D, it is 16x bigger
than in regular case when it's actually needed. This leads to some
crashes in stress conditions.

[How]
Skip ramp combining designed for RGB256 and DXGI gamma with CS_TFM_1D.
