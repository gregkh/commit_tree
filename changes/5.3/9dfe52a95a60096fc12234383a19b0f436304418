SUNRPC: Move call to rpc_count_iostats before rpc_call_done

For diagnostic purposes, it would be useful to have an rpc_iostats
metric of RPCs completing with tk_status < 0.  Unfortunately,
tk_status is reset inside the rpc_call_done functions for each
operation, and the call to tally the per-op metrics comes after
rpc_call_done.  Refactor the call to rpc_count_iostat earlier in
rpc_exit_task so we can count these RPCs completing in error.
