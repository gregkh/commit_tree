RDMA/efa: Remove check that prevents destroy of resources in error flows

Drivers cannot check the udata for validity when doing destroy as there
will be no way to report this error back to the uverbs.

Since udata is new for destroy no driver should start to use it - instead
drivers should opt for the ioctl interface and define it in a way where it
cannot fail due to incorrect data.

Remove the checks on udata construction so EFA is consistent with
everything else.
