hwspinlock: add the 'in_atomic' API

Add the 'in_atomic' mode which can be called from an atomic context.
This mode relies on the existing 'raw' mode (no lock, no preemption/irq
disabling) with the difference that the timeout is not based on jiffies
(jiffies won't increase when irq are disabled) but handled with
busy-waiting udelay() calls.
