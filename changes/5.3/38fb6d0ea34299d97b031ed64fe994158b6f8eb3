f2fs: use EINVAL for superblock with invalid magic

The kernel mount_block_root() function expects -EACESS or -EINVAL for a
unmountable filesystem when trying to mount the root with different
filesystem types.

However, in 5.3-rc1 the behavior when F2FS code cannot find valid block
changed to return -EFSCORRUPTED(-EUCLEAN), and this error code makes
mount_block_root() fail when trying to probe F2FS.

When the magic number of the superblock mismatches, it has a high
probability that it's just not a F2FS. In this case return -EINVAL seems
to be a better result, and this return value can make mount_block_root()
probing work again.

Return -EINVAL when the superblock has magic mismatch, -EFSCORRUPTED in
other cases (the magic matches but the superblock cannot be recognized).
