posix-timers: Use spin_lock_irq() in itimer_delete()

itimer_delete() uses spin_lock_irqsave() to obtain a `flags' variable
which can then be passed to unlock_timer(). It uses already spin_lock
locking for the structure instead of lock_timer() because it has a timer
which can not be removed by others at this point. The cleanup is always
performed with enabled interrupts.

Use spin_lock_irq() / spin_unlock_irq() so the `flags' variable can be
removed.
