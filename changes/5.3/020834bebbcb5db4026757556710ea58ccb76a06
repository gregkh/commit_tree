Input: applespi - select CRC16 module

In some rare randconfig builds, CRC16 is disabled, which leads
to a link error:

drivers/input/keyboard/applespi.o: In function `applespi_send_cmd_msg':
applespi.c:(.text+0x449f): undefined reference to `crc16'
drivers/input/keyboard/applespi.o: In function `applespi_verify_crc':
applespi.c:(.text+0x7538): undefined reference to `crc16'

This symbol is meant to be selected for each user in Kconfig,
so do that here as well.
