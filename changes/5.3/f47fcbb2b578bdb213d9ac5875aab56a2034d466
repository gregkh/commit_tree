fscrypt: rename fscrypt_do_page_crypto() to fscrypt_crypt_block()

fscrypt_do_page_crypto() only does a single encryption or decryption
operation, with a single logical block number (single IV).  So it
actually operates on a filesystem block, not a "page" per se.  To
reflect this, rename it to fscrypt_crypt_block().
