net/mlx5e: Add kTLS TX HW offload support

Add support for transmit side kernel-TLS acceleration.
Offload the crypto encryption to HW.

Per TLS connection:
- Use a separate TIS to maintain the HW context.
- Use a separate encryption key.
- Maintain static and progress HW contexts by posting the proper
  WQEs at creation time, or upon resync.
- Use a special DUMP opcode to replay the previous frags and sync
  the HW context.

To make sure the SQ is able to serve an xmit request, increase
SQ stop room to cover:
- static params WQE,
- progress params WQE, and
- resync DUMP per frag.

Currently supporting TLS 1.2, and key size 128bit.

Tested over SimX simulator.
