of: resolver: Add of_node_put() before return and break

Each iteration of for_each_child_of_node puts the previous node, but in
the case of a return or break from the middle of the loop, there is no
put, thus causing a memory leak. Hence add an of_node_put before the
return or break in three places.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
