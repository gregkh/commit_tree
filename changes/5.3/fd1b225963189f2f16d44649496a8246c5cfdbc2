net/mlx5e: Tx, Make SQ WQE fetch function type generic

Change mlx5e_sq_fetch_wqe to be agnostic to the Work Queue
Element (WQE) type.
Before this patch, it was specific for struct mlx5e_tx_wqe.

In order to allow the change, the function now returns the
generic void pointer, and gets the WQE size to do the zero
memset.
