netfilter: xt_nfacct: Fix alignment mismatch in xt_nfacct_match_info

When running a 64-bit kernel with a 32-bit iptables binary, the size of
the xt_nfacct_match_info struct diverges.

    kernel: sizeof(struct xt_nfacct_match_info) : 40
    iptables: sizeof(struct xt_nfacct_match_info)) : 36

Trying to append nfacct related rules results in an unhelpful message.
Although it is suggested to look for more information in dmesg, nothing
can be found there.

    # iptables -A <chain> -m nfacct --nfacct-name <acct-object>
    iptables: Invalid argument. Run `dmesg' for more information.

This patch fixes the memory misalignment by enforcing 8-byte alignment
within the struct's first revision. This solution is often used in many
other uapi netfilter headers.
