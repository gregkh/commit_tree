powercap: Invoke powercap_init() and rapl_init() earlier

The MMIO RAPL interface driver depends on both powercap subsystem and
the intel_rapl_common code.

But when all of them are built-in, the MMIO RAPL interface driver can
be loaded before the other two and this breaks the system during boot.

Fix this by adjusting the init order of the powercap subsystem and the
intel_rapl_common code, so that it can be initialized first.
