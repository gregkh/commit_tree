media: mt9m111: fix fw-node refactoring

In the patch refactoring the fw-node, the mt9m111 was broken for all
platform_data based platforms, which were the first aim of this
driver. Only the devicetree platform are still functional, probably
because the testing was done on these.

The result is that -EINVAL is systematically return for such platforms,
what this patch fixes.
