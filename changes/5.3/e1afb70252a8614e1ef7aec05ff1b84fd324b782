bpf: check signal validity in nmi for bpf_send_signal() helper

Commit 8b401f9ed244 ("bpf: implement bpf_send_signal() helper")
introduced bpf_send_signal() helper. If the context is nmi,
the sending signal work needs to be deferred to irq_work.
If the signal is invalid, the error will appear in irq_work
and it won't be propagated to user.

This patch did an early check in the helper itself to notify
user invalid signal, as suggested by Daniel.
