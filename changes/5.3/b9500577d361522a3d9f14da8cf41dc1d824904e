iwlwifi: pcie: handle switching killer Qu B0 NICs to C0

We need to use a different firmware for C0 versions of killer Qu NICs.
Add structures for them and handle them in the if block that detects
C0 revisions.

Additionally, instead of having an inclusive check for QnJ devices,
make the selection exclusive, so that switching to QnJ is the
exception, not the default.  This prevents us from having to add all
the non-QnJ cards to an exclusion list.  To do so, only go into the
QnJ block if the device has an RF ID type HR and HW revision QnJ.
