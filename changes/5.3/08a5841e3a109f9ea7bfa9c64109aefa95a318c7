ASoC: soc-core: use snd_soc_dai_link_component for CPU

current ALSA SoC is starting to support modern style dai_linke
(= struct snd_soc_dai_link_component) which is mainly used for
multipul DAI/component connection.
Now Codec has full multi-codec support, Platform is using modern
style but still for single Platform.
Only CPU is not yet supporting modern style yet.
If we could support it for CPU, we can switch to modern style
dai_link on all CPU/Codec/Platform, and remove legacy style
from ALSA SoC.

Multi-CPU will be supported in the future.
This patch is initial support for modern style for CPU
