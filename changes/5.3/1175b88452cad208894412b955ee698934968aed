scsi: megaraid_sas: Enable msix_load_balance for Invader and later controllers

Load balancing IO completions across all available MSI-X vectors should be
enabled for Invader and later generation controllers only.  This needs to
be disabled for older controllers.  Add an adapter type check before
setting msix_load_balance flag.
