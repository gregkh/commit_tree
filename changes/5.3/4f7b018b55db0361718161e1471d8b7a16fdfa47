ASoC: rt5677: clear interrupts by polarity flip

The rt5677 jack detection function has a requirement that the polarity
of an interrupt be flipped after it fires in order to clear the
interrupt.

This patch implements an irq_chip with irq_domain directly instead of
using regmap-irq, so that interrupt source line polarities can be
flipped in the irq handler.

The reason that this patch does not add this feature within regmap-irq
is that future patches will add hotword detection support to this irq
handler. Those patches will require adding additional logic that would
not make sense to have in regmap-irq.
