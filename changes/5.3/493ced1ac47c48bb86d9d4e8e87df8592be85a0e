ipv4: Allow routes to use nexthop objects

Add support for RTA_NH_ID attribute to allow a user to specify a
nexthop id to use with a route. fc_nh_id is added to fib_config to
hold the value passed in the RTA_NH_ID attribute. If a nexthop id
is given, the gateway, device, encap and multipath attributes can
not be set.

Update fib_nh_match to check ids on a route delete.
