net: link_watch: prevent starvation when processing linkwatch wq

When user has configured a large number of virtual netdev, such
as 4K vlans, the carrier on/off operation of the real netdev
will also cause it's virtual netdev's link state to be processed
in linkwatch. Currently, the processing is done in a work queue,
which may cause rtnl locking starvation problem and worker
starvation problem for other work queue, such as irqfd_inject wq.

This patch releases the cpu when link watch worker has processed
a fixed number of netdev' link watch event, and schedule the
work queue again when there is still link watch event remaining.
