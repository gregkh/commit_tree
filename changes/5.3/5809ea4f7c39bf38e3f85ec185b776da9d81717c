xprtrdma: Remove the RPCRDMA_REQ_F_PENDING flag

Commit 9590d083c1bb ("xprtrdma: Use xprt_pin_rqst in
rpcrdma_reply_handler") pins incoming RPC/RDMA replies so they
can be left in the pending requests queue while they are being
processed without introducing a race between ->buf_free and the
transport's reply handler. Therefore RPCRDMA_REQ_F_PENDING is no
longer necessary.
