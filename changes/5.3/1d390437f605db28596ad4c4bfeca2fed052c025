ARM: dts: rockchip: Allow wakeup from rk3288-veyron's dwc2 USB ports

We want to be able to wake from USB if a device is plugged in that
wants remote wakeup.  Enable it on both dwc2 controllers.

NOTE: this is added specifically to veyron and not to rk3288 in
general since it's not known whether all rk3288 boards are designed to
support USB wakeup.  It is plausible that some boards could shut down
important rails in S3.

Also note that currently wakeup doesn't seem to happen unless you use
the "deep" suspend mode (where SDRAM is turned off).  Presumably the
shallow suspend mode is gating some sort of clock that's important but
I couldn't easily figure out how to get it working.
