ath10k: add PN replay protection for high latency devices

On high latency devices (SDIO, USB) ath10k did not do PN replay check, a data
frame with an invalid PN number was not discard as it should have been. So this
patch implements PN replay in ath10k. PN replay check for fragmented frames is
implemented in followup patch.

With low latency devices (PCI, AHB) hardware can store the data
frames's content to host memory directly and the firmware can fully reorder
data frames, and do PN replay check at the same time. But for high latency
devices all data frames will be received and stored in firmware's memory and it
is hard to do full reorder because of the memory size limitations in the
firmware. This is why the PN replay protections needs to be implemented in host
driver.

Tested on QCA6174 SDIO with firmware WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00007-QCARMSWP-1.
