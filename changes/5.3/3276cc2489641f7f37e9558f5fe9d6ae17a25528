arm64: Update silicon-errata.txt for Neoverse-N1 #1349291

Neoverse-N1 affected by #1349291 may report an Uncontained RAS Error
as Unrecoverable. The kernel's architecture code already considers
Unrecoverable errors as fatal as without kernel-first support no
further error-handling is possible.

Now that KVM attributes SError to the host/guest more precisely
the host's architecture code will always handle host errors that
become pending during world-switch.
Errors misclassified by this errata that affected the guest will be
re-injected to the guest as an implementation-defined SError, which can
be uncontained.

Until kernel-first support is implemented, no workaround is needed
for this issue.
