powerpc: Fix compile issue with force DAWR

If you compile with KVM but without CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT you fail
at linking with:
  arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rmhandlers.o:(.text+0x708): undefined reference to `dawr_force_enable'

This was caused by commit c1fe190c0672 ("powerpc: Add force enable of
DAWR on P9 option").

This moves a bunch of code around to fix this. It moves a lot of the
DAWR code in a new file and creates a new CONFIG_PPC_DAWR to enable
compiling it.

Fixes: c1fe190c0672 ("powerpc: Add force enable of DAWR on P9 option")
