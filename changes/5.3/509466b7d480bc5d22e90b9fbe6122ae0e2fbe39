sched/fair: Fix "runnable_avg_yN_inv" not used warnings

runnable_avg_yN_inv[] is only used in kernel/sched/pelt.c but was
included in several other places because they need other macros all
came from kernel/sched/sched-pelt.h which was generated by
Documentation/scheduler/sched-pelt. As the result, it causes compilation
a lot of warnings,

  kernel/sched/sched-pelt.h:4:18: warning: 'runnable_avg_yN_inv' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
  kernel/sched/sched-pelt.h:4:18: warning: 'runnable_avg_yN_inv' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
  kernel/sched/sched-pelt.h:4:18: warning: 'runnable_avg_yN_inv' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
  ...

Silence it by appending the __maybe_unused attribute for it, so all
generated variables and macros can still be kept in the same file.
