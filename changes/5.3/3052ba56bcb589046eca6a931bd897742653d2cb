tools perf: Move from sane_ctype.h obtained from git to the Linux's original

We got the sane_ctype.h headers from git and kept using it so far, but
since that code originally came from the kernel sources to the git
sources, perhaps its better to just use the one in the kernel, so that
we can leverage tools/perf/check_headers.sh to be notified when our copy
gets out of sync, i.e. when fixes or goodies are added to the code we've
copied.

This will help with things like tools/lib/string.c where we want to have
more things in common with the kernel, such as strim(), skip_spaces(),
etc so as to go on removing the things that we have in tools/perf/util/
and instead using the code in the kernel, indirectly and removing things
like EXPORT_SYMBOL(), etc, getting notified when fixes and improvements
are made to the original code.

Hopefully this also should help with reducing the difference of code
hosted in tools/ to the one in the kernel proper.
