keys: Move the user and user-session keyrings to the user_namespace

Move the user and user-session keyrings to the user_namespace struct rather
than pinning them from the user_struct struct.  This prevents these
keyrings from propagating across user-namespaces boundaries with regard to
the KEY_SPEC_* flags, thereby making them more useful in a containerised
environment.

The issue is that a single user_struct may be represent UIDs in several
different namespaces.

The way the patch does this is by attaching a 'register keyring' in each
user_namespace and then sticking the user and user-session keyrings into
that.  It can then be searched to retrieve them.
