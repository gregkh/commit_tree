ixgbe: fix double clean of Tx descriptors with xdp

Tx code doesn't clear the descriptors' status after cleaning.
So, if the budget is larger than number of used elems in a ring, some
descriptors will be accounted twice and xsk_umem_complete_tx will move
prod_tail far beyond the prod_head breaking the completion queue ring.

Fix that by limiting the number of descriptors to clean by the number
of used descriptors in the Tx ring.

'ixgbe_clean_xdp_tx_irq()' function refactored to look more like
'ixgbe_xsk_clean_tx_ring()' since we're allowed to directly use
'next_to_clean' and 'next_to_use' indexes.
