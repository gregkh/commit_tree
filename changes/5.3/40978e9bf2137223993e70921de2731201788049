perf inject: The tool->read() call may pass a NULL evsel, handle it

Check first, as machines__deliver_event() may have
perf_evlist__id2evsel() returning NULL.

This was found while checking a report from Leo Yan that used the smatch
tool to find places where a pointer is checked before use and then,
later in the same function gets used without checking.
