bcache: add io error counting in write_bdev_super_endio()

When backing device super block is written by bch_write_bdev_super(),
the bio complete callback write_bdev_super_endio() simply ignores I/O
status. Indeed such write request also contribute to backing device
health status if the request failed.

This patch checkes bio->bi_status in write_bdev_super_endio(), if there
is error, bch_count_backing_io_errors() will be called to count an I/O
error to dc->io_errors.
