ceph: return -ERANGE if virtual xattr value didn't fit in buffer

The getxattr manpage states that we should return ERANGE if the
destination buffer size is too small to hold the value.
ceph_vxattrcb_layout does this internally, but we should be doing
this for all vxattrs.

Fix the only caller of getxattr_cb to check the returned size
against the buffer length and return -ERANGE if it doesn't fit.
Drop the same check in ceph_vxattrcb_layout and just rely on the
caller to handle it.
