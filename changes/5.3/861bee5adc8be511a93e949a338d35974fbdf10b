ALSA: usb-audio: Enable .product_name override for Emagic, Unitor 8.

The Emagic Unitor 8 does not provide iManufacturer and iProduct fields
in its device descriptor. These fields are used by alsa to make build the
device name. Thus uncomment the .product-name in the quirks-table.

Without this change the device shows up as 'USB Device 0x86a:0x01'.
