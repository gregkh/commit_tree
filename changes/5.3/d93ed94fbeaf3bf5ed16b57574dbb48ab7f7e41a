net: hns3: add aRFS support for PF

This patch adds aRFS support for PF. The aRFS rules are also
stored in the hardware flow director table, Use the existing
filter management functions to insert TCPv4/UDPv4/TCPv6/UDPv6
flow director filters. To avoid rule conflict, once user adds
flow director rules with ethtool, the aRFS will be disabled,
and clear exist aRFS rules. Once all user configure rules were
removed, aRFS can work again.
