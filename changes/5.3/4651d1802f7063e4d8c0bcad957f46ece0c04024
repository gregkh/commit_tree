net/smc: make sure EPOLLOUT is raised

Currently, we are only explicitly setting SOCK_NOSPACE on a write timeout
for non-blocking sockets. Epoll() edge-trigger mode relies on SOCK_NOSPACE
being set when -EAGAIN is returned to ensure that EPOLLOUT is raised.
Expand the setting of SOCK_NOSPACE to non-blocking sockets as well that can
use SO_SNDTIMEO to adjust their write timeout. This mirrors the behavior
that Eric Dumazet introduced for tcp sockets.
