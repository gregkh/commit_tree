net_sched: fix a NULL pointer deref in ipt action

The net pointer in struct xt_tgdtor_param is not explicitly
initialized therefore is still NULL when dereferencing it.
So we have to find a way to pass the correct net pointer to
ipt_destroy_target().

The best way I find is just saving the net pointer inside the per
netns struct tcf_idrinfo, which could make this patch smaller.
