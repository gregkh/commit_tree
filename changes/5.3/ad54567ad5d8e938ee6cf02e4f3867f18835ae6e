PCI: Reset both NVIDIA GPU and HDA in ThinkPad P50 workaround

quirk_reset_lenovo_thinkpad_50_nvgpu() resets NVIDIA GPUs to work around
an apparent BIOS defect.  It previously used pci_reset_function(), and
the available method was a bus reset, which was fine because there was
only one function on the bus.  After b516ea586d71 ("PCI: Enable NVIDIA
HDA controllers"), there are now two functions (the HDA controller and
the GPU itself) on the bus, so the reset fails.

Use pci_reset_bus() explicitly instead of pci_reset_function() since it's
OK to reset both devices.
