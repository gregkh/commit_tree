ALSA: firewire-lib: compute pointer to payload buffer in context handler

The value of pointer to payload buffer is computed in each packet
handler, however the pointer can be decided before call of packet
handler.

This commit adds an argument for the pointer to the packet handler to
reduce codes to compute for the pointer.
