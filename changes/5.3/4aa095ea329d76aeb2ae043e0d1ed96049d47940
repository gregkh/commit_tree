swiotlb: Return consistent SWIOTLB segments/nr_tbl

With a specifically contrived memory layout where there is no physical
memory available to the kernel below the 4GB boundary, we will fail to
perform the initial swiotlb_init() call and set no_iotlb_memory to true.

There are drivers out there that call into swiotlb_nr_tbl() to determine
whether they can use the SWIOTLB. With the right DMA_BIT_MASK() value
for these drivers (say 64-bit), they won't ever need to hit
swiotlb_tbl_map_single() so this can go unoticed and we would be
possibly lying about those drivers.
