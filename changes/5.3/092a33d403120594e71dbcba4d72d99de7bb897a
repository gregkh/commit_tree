ice: Cleanup ice_update_link_info

Do not allocate memory for the Get PHY Abilities command data buffer when
it is not necessary, change one local variable to another to reduce the
number of de-references, reduce the scope of some local variables, and
reorder the code and change exit points to get rid of an unnecessary goto
label.
