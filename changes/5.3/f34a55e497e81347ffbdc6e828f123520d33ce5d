RDMA/core: Get sum value of all counters when perform a sysfs stat read

Since a QP can only be bound to one counter, then if it is bound to a
separate counter, for backward compatibility purpose, the statistic value
must be:
* stat of default counter
+ stat of all running allocated counters
+ stat of all deallocated counters (history stats)
