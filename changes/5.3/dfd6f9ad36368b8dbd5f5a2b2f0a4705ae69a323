ACPI: fix false-positive -Wuninitialized warning

clang gets confused by an uninitialized variable in what looks
to it like a never executed code path:

arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:618:13: error: variable 'polarity' is uninitialized when used here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
        polarity = polarity ? ACPI_ACTIVE_LOW : ACPI_ACTIVE_HIGH;
                   ^~~~~~~~
arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:606:32: note: initialize the variable 'polarity' to silence this warning
        int rc, irq, trigger, polarity;
                                      ^
                                       = 0
arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:617:12: error: variable 'trigger' is uninitialized when used here [-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
        trigger = trigger ? ACPI_LEVEL_SENSITIVE : ACPI_EDGE_SENSITIVE;
                  ^~~~~~~
arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c:606:22: note: initialize the variable 'trigger' to silence this warning
        int rc, irq, trigger, polarity;
                            ^
                             = 0

This is unfortunately a design decision in clang and won't be fixed.

Changing the acpi_get_override_irq() macro to an inline function
reliably avoids the issue.
