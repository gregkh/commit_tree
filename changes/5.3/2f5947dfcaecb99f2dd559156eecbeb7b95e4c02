Documentation: move Documentation/virtual to Documentation/virt

Renaming docs seems to be en vogue at the moment, so fix on of the
grossly misnamed directories.  We usually never use "virtual" as
a shortcut for virtualization in the kernel, but always virt,
as seen in the virt/ top-level directory.  Fix up the documentation
to match that.
