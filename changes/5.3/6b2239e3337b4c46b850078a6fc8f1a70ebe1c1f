ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: reserve host DMA channel for hostless streams

Due to the HW programming sequence requirement that the host
and link DMA channels need to be coupled/decoupled during pcm
hw_params, the host DMA channel corresponding to the link
DMA channel in use for hostless streams needs to be reserved.
This is achieved by adding a host_reserved flag in the
sof_intel_hda_stream structure which is checked when assigning
a host DMA channel.
