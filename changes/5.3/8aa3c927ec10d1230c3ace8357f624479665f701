mm/mmap: move common defines to mman-common.h

Two architecture that use arch specific MMAP flags are powerpc and
sparc.  We still have few flag values common across them and other
architectures.  Consolidate this in mman-common.h.

Also update the comment to indicate where to find HugeTLB specific
reserved values
