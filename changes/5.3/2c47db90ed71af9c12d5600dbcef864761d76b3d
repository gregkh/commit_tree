perf intel-pt: Add support for efficient time interval filtering

Set up time ranges for efficient time interval filtering using the new
"fast forward" facility.

Because decoding is done in time order, intel_pt_time_filter() needs to
look only at the next start or end timestamp - refer intel_pt_next_time().
