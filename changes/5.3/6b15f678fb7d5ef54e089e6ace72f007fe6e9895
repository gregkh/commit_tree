include/asm-generic/bug.h: fix "cut here" for WARN_ON for __WARN_TAINT architectures

For architectures using __WARN_TAINT, the WARN_ON macro did not print
out the "cut here" string.  The other WARN_XXX macros would print "cut
here" inside __warn_printk, which is not called for WARN_ON since it
doesn't have a message to print.
