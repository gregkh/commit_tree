net: mvpp2: prs: Don't override the sign bit in SRAM parser shift

The Header Parser allows identifying various fields in the packet
headers, used for various kind of filtering and classification
steps.

This is a re-entrant process, where the offset in the packet header
depends on the previous lookup results. This offset is represented in
the SRAM results of the TCAM, as a shift to be operated.

This shift can be negative in some cases, such as in IPv6 parsing.

This commit prevents overriding the sign bit when setting the shift
value, which could cause instabilities when parsing IPv6 flows.
