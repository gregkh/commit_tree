s390: enforce CONFIG_SMP

There never have been distributions that shiped with CONFIG_SMP=n for
s390. In addition the kernel currently doesn't even compile with
CONFIG_SMP=n for s390. Most likely it wouldn't even work, even if we
fix the compile error, since nobody tests it, since there is no use
case that I can think of.
Therefore simply enforce CONFIG_SMP and get rid of some more or
less unused code.
