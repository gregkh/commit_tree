arm64: KVM: Propagate full Spectre v2 workaround state to KVM guests

Recent commits added the explicit notion of "workaround not required" to
the state of the Spectre v2 (aka. BP_HARDENING) workaround, where we
just had "needed" and "unknown" before.

Export this knowledge to the rest of the kernel and enhance the existing
kvm_arm_harden_branch_predictor() to report this new state as well.
Export this new state to guests when they use KVM's firmware interface
emulation.
