drm/i915: extract intel_atomic.h from intel_drv.h

It used to be handy that we only had a couple of headers, but over time
intel_drv.h has become unwieldy. Extract declarations to a separate
header file corresponding to the implementation module, clarifying the
modularity of the driver.

Ensure the new header is self-contained, and do so with minimal further
includes, using forward declarations as needed. Include the new header
only where needed, and sort the modified include directives while at it
and as needed.

No functional changes.
