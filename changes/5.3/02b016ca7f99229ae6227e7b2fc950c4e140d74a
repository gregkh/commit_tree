ext4: enforce the immutable flag on open files

According to the chattr man page, "a file with the 'i' attribute
cannot be modified..."  Historically, this was only enforced when the
file was opened, per the rest of the description, "... and the file
can not be opened in write mode".

There is general agreement that we should standardize all file systems
to prevent modifications even for files that were opened at the time
the immutable flag is set.  Eventually, a change to enforce this at
the VFS layer should be landing in mainline.  Until then, enforce this
at the ext4 level to prevent xfstests generic/553 from failing.
