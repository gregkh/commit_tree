net: hns3: sync VLAN filter entries when kill VLAN ID failed

When HW is resetting, firmware is unable to handle commands
from driver. So if remove VLAN device from stack at this time,
it will fail to remove the VLAN ID from HW VLAN filter, then
the VLAN filter status is unsynced with stack.

This patch fixes it by recording the VLAN ID delete failed,
and removes them again when reset complete.
