HID: quirks: Set the INCREMENT_USAGE_ON_DUPLICATE quirk on Saitek X52

The Saitek X52 joystick has a pair of axes that are originally
(by the Windows driver) used as mouse pointer controls. The corresponding
usage->hid values are 0x50024 and 0x50026. Thus they are handled
as unknown axes and both get mapped to ABS_MISC. The quirk makes
the second axis to be mapped to ABS_MISC1 and thus made available
separately.
