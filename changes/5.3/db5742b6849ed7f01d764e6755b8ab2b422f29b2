perf stat: Support per-die aggregation

It is useful to aggregate counts per die. E.g. Uncore becomes die-scope
on Xeon Cascade Lake-AP.

Introduce a new option "--per-die" to support per-die aggregation.

The global id for each core has been changed to socket + die id + core
id. The global id for each die is socket + die id.

Add die information for per-core aggregation. The output of per-core
aggregation will be changed from "S0-C0" to "S0-D0-C0". Any scripts
which rely on the output format of per-core aggregation probably be
broken.

For 'perf stat record/report', there is no die information when
processing the old perf.data. The per-die result will be the same as
per-socket.

Committer notes:

Renamed 'die' variable to 'die_id' to fix the build in some systems:

    CC       /tmp/build/perf/builtin-script.o
  cc1: warnings being treated as errors
  builtin-stat.c: In function 'perf_env__get_die':
  builtin-stat.c:963: error: declaration of 'die' shadows a global declaration
  util/util.h:19: error: shadowed declaration is here
  mv: cannot stat `/tmp/build/perf/.builtin-stat.o.tmp': No such file or directory
