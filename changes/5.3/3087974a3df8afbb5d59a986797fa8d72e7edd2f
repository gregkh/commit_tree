bus: brcmstb_gisb: Remove print of base address

Since commit ad67b74d2469 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p")
pointers are being hashed when printed. Displaying the virtual memory at
bootup time is not helpful, especially given we use a dev_info() which
already displays the platform device's address.
