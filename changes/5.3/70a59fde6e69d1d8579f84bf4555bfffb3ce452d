cpufreq: Avoid calling cpufreq_verify_current_freq() from handle_update()

On some occasions cpufreq_verify_current_freq() schedules a work whose
callback is handle_update(), which further calls cpufreq_update_policy()
which may end up calling cpufreq_verify_current_freq() again.

On the other hand, when cpufreq_update_policy() is called from
handle_update(), the pointer to the cpufreq policy is already
available, but cpufreq_cpu_acquire() is still called to get it in
cpufreq_update_policy(), which should be avoided as well.

To fix these issues, create a new helper, refresh_frequency_limits(),
and make both handle_update() call it cpufreq_update_policy().
