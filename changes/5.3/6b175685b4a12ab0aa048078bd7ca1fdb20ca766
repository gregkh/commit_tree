crypto: caam/qi - don't allocate an extra platform device

Use the controller device for caam/qi instead of allocating
a new platform device.
This is needed as a preparation to add support for working behind an
SMMU. A platform device allocated using platform_device_register_full()
is not completely set up - most importantly .dma_configure()
is not called.
