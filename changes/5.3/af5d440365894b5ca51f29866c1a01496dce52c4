mm: vmscan: remove double slab pressure by inc'ing sc->nr_scanned

Commit 9092c71bb724 ("mm: use sc->priority for slab shrink targets") has
broken up the relationship between sc->nr_scanned and slab pressure.
The sc->nr_scanned can't double slab pressure anymore.  So, it sounds no
sense to still keep sc->nr_scanned inc'ed.  Actually, it would prevent
from adding pressure on slab shrink since excessive sc->nr_scanned would
prevent from scan->priority raise.

The bonnie test doesn't show this would change the behavior of slab
shrinkers.

Sequential delete: 	3960.6    94.6    3997.6     96.2
Random delete: 		2518      63.8    2561.6     64.6

The slight increase of "/sec" without the patch would be caused by the
slight increase of CPU usage.
