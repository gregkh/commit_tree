net: netsec: Sync dma for device on buffer allocation

Quoting Arnd,

We have to do a sync_single_for_device /somewhere/ before the
buffer is given to the device. On a non-cache-coherent machine with
a write-back cache, there may be dirty cache lines that get written back
after the device DMA's data into it (e.g. from a previous memset
from before the buffer got freed), so you absolutely need to flush any
dirty cache lines on it first.

Since the coherency is configurable in this device make sure we cover
all configurations by explicitly syncing the allocated buffer for the
device before refilling it's descriptors
