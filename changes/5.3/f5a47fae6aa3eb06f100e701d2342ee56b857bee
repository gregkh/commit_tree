iwlwifi: mvm: fix version check for GEO_TX_POWER_LIMIT support

We erroneously added a check for FW API version 41 before sending
GEO_TX_POWER_LIMIT, but this was already implemented in version 38.
Additionally, it was cherry-picked to older versions, namely 17, 26
and 29, so check for those as well.
