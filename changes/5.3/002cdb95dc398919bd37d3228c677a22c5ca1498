Input: gpio_keys - use struct_size() in devm_kzalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct gpio_keys_drvdata {
	...
        struct gpio_button_data data[0];
};

size = sizeof(struct gpio_keys_drvdata) + count * sizeof(struct gpio_button_data);
instance = devm_kzalloc(dev, size, GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(instance, data, count), GFP_KERNEL);

Notice that, in this case, variable size is not necessary, hence it
is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
