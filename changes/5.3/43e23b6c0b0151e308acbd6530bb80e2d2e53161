debugfs: log errors when something goes wrong

As it is not recommended that debugfs calls be checked, it was pointed
out that major errors should still be logged somewhere so that
developers and users have a chance to figure out what went wrong.  To
help with this, error logging has been added to the debugfs core so that
it is not needed to be present in every individual file that calls
debugfs.
