arm64: Do not enable IRQs for ct_user_exit

For el0_dbg and el0_error, DAIF bits get explicitly cleared before
calling ct_user_exit.

When context tracking is disabled, DAIF gets set (almost) immediately
after. When context tracking is enabled, among the first things done
is disabling IRQs.

What is actually needed is:
- PSR.D = 0 so the system can be debugged (should be already the case)
- PSR.A = 0 so async error can be handled during context tracking

Do not clear PSR.I in those two locations.
