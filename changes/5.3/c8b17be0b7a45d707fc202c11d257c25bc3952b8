net: ipv4: add skbuff fraglist splitter

This patch adds the skbuff fraglist splitter. This API provides an
iterator to transform the fraglist into single skbuff objects, it
consists of:

* ip_fraglist_init(), that initializes the internal state of the
  fraglist splitter.
* ip_fraglist_prepare(), that restores the IPv4 header on the
  fragments.
* ip_fraglist_next(), that retrieves the fragment from the fraglist and
  it updates the internal state of the splitter to point to the next
  fragment skbuff in the fraglist.

The ip_fraglist_iter object stores the internal state of the iterator.

This code has been extracted from ip_do_fragment(). Symbols are also
exported to allow to reuse this iterator from the bridge codepath to
build its own refragmentation routine by reusing the existing codebase.
