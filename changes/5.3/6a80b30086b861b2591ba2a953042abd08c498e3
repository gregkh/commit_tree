fmc: Delete the FMC subsystem

The FMC subsystem was created in 2012 with the ambition to
drive development of drivers for this hardware upstream.

The current implementation has architectural flaws and would
need to be revamped using real hardware to something that can
reuse existing kernel abstractions in the subsystems for e.g.
I2C, FPGA and GPIO.

We have concluded that for the mainline kernel it will be
better to delete the subsystem and start over with a clean
slate when/if an active maintainer steps up.
