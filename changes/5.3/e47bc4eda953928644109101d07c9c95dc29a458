block: add centralize REQ_OP_XXX to string helper

In order to centralize the REQ_OP_XXX to string conversion which can be
used in the block layer and different places in the kernel like f2fs,
this patch adds a new helper function along with an array similar to the
one present in the blk-mq-debugfs.c.

We keep this helper functionality centralize under blk-core.c instead of
blk-mq-debugfs.c since blk-core.c is configured using CONFIG_BLOCK and
it will not be dependent on blk-mq-debugfs.c which is configured using
CONFIG_BLK_DEBUG_FS.

Next patch adjusts the code in the blk-mq-debugfs.c with newly
introduced helper.
