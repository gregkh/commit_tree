net: ipv4: split skbuff into fragments transformer

This patch exposes a new API to refragment a skbuff. This allows you to
split either a linear skbuff or to force the refragmentation of an
existing fraglist using a different mtu. The API consists of:

* ip_frag_init(), that initializes the internal state of the transformer.
* ip_frag_next(), that allows you to fetch the next fragment. This function
  internally allocates the skbuff that represents the fragment, it pushes
  the IPv4 header, and it also copies the payload for each fragment.

The ip_frag_state object stores the internal state of the splitter.

This code has been extracted from ip_do_fragment(). Symbols are also
exported to allow to reuse this iterator from the bridge codepath to
build its own refragmentation routine by reusing the existing codebase.
