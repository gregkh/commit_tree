drm/amd/display: Don't load DMCU for Raven 1 (v2)

[WHY]
Some early Raven boards had a bad SBIOS that doesn't play nicely with
the DMCU FW. We thought the issues were fixed by ignoring errors on DMCU
load but that doesn't seem to be the case. We've still seen reports of
users unable to boot their systems at all.

[HOW]
Disable DMCU load on Raven 1. Only load it for Raven 2 and Picasso.

v2: Fix ifdef (Alex)
