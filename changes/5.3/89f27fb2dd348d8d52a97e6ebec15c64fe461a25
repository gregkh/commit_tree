clk: sunxi-ng: sun8i-r: Use local parent references for SUNXI_CCU_GATE

With the new clk parenting code and SUNXI_CCU_GATE macros, we can
reference parents locally via pointers to struct clk_hw or DT
clock-names.

Convert existing SUNXI_CCU_GATE definitions to SUNXI_CCU_GATE_HWS
as the parent clock is internal to this clock unit.

To avoid duplication of clock definitions, we fix up the parent
reference for A83T in the A83T init function.
