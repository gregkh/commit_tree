ALSA: firewire-lib: use dynamic array for CIP header of tracing events

This modules handles two types of isochronous packet; one has CIP header
in IEC 61883-1/6 and another doesn't. The module also have tracing events
corresponding to the types of packet. To unify the events, one event
should be probed with or without CIP header.

This commit uses dynamic array for the events to be available for the
types of packet.
