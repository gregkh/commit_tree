nfp: tls: make use of kernel-driven TX resync

When TCP stream gets out of sync (driver stops receiving skbs
with expected TCP sequence numbers) request a TX resync from
the kernel.

We try to distinguish retransmissions from missed transmissions
by comparing the sequence number to expected - if it's further
than the expected one - we probably missed packets.
