drm/i915: Move GEM object domain management from struct_mutex to local

Use the per-object local lock to control the cache domain of the
individual GEM objects, not struct_mutex. This is a huge leap forward
for us in terms of object-level synchronisation; execbuffers are
coordinated using the ww_mutex and pread/pwrite is finally fully
serialised again.
