media: dvb_frontend: split dvb_frontend_handle_ioctl function

Over time, dvb_frontend_handle_ioctl() has grown to the point where
we now get a warning from the compiler about excessive stack usage:

drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c: In function 'dvb_frontend_handle_ioctl':
drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c:2692:1: error: the frame size of 1048 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

Almost all of this is used by the dtv_frontend_properties structure
in the FE_GET_PROPERTY and FE_GET_FRONTEND commands. Splitting those
into separate function reduces the stack usage of the main function
to just 136 bytes, the others are under 500 each.
