drm: bridge: Add dual_link field to the drm_bridge_timings structure

Extend the drm_bridge_timings structure with a new dual_link field to
indicate that the bridge's input bus carries data on two separate
physical links. The first use case is LVDS dual-link mode where even-
and odd-numbered pixels are transferred on separate LVDS links.
