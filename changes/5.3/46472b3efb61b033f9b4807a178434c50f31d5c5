drm/i915: Move i915_request_alloc into selftests/

Having transitioned GEM over to using intel_context as its primary means
of tracking the GEM context and engine combined and using
i915_request_create(), we can move the older i915_request_alloc()
helper function into selftests/ where the remaining users are confined.
