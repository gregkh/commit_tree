mtd: hyperbus: Add driver for TI's HyperBus memory controller

Add driver for HyperBus memory controller on TI's AM654 SoC. Programming
IP is pretty simple and provides direct memory mapped access to
connected Flash devices.

Add basic support for the IP without DMA. Second chip-select is not
supported for now.
