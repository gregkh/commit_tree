ASoC: mediatek: mt8183: move card registration to the end of probe

mt8183_mt6358_ts3a227_max98357_dev_probe() does not return immediately
if devm_snd_soc_register_card() returns fail.  As a result, the rest of
code still get executed.

Two options to fix:
1. add an extra return statement if devm_snd_soc_register_card()
   returns fail
2. move devm_snd_soc_register_card() to the end of probe

Adopt option 2 which is more clear and common.
