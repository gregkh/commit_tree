drm/msm/dsi: Add old timings quirk for 10nm phy

The v3.0.0 10nm phy has two different implementations between MSM8998 and
SDM845, which require different timings calculations.  Unfortunately, the
hardware designers did not choose to revise the version to account for this
delta so implement a quirk instead.
