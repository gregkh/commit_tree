net: hisilicon: HI13X1_GMAX skip write LOCAL_PAGE_REG

HI13X1_GMAC changed the offsets and bitmaps for
GE_TX_LOCAL_PAGE_REG registers in the same peripheral
device on different models of the hip04_eth. With the
default configuration, HI13X1_GMAC can also work without
any writes to the GE_TX_LOCAL_PAGE_REG register.
