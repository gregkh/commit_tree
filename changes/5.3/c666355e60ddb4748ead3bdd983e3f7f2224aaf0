media: radio-raremono: change devm_k*alloc to k*alloc

Change devm_k*alloc to k*alloc to manually allocate memory

The manual allocation and freeing of memory is necessary because when
the USB radio is disconnected, the memory associated with devm_k*alloc
is freed. Meaning if we still have unresolved references to the radio
device, then we get use-after-free errors.

This patch fixes this by manually allocating memory, and freeing it in
the v4l2.release callback that gets called when the last radio device
exits.
