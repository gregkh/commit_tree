pwm: fsl-ftm: Use write protection for prescaler & polarity

Modifying the prescaler or polarity value must be done with the
write protection disabled. Currently this is working by chance as
the write protection is in a disabled state by default.
This patch makes sure that we enable/disable the write protection
when needed.
