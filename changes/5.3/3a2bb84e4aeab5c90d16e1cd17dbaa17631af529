net/packet: remove locking from packet_rcv_has_room()

__packet_rcv_has_room() can now be run without lock being held.

po->pressure is only a non persistent hint, we can mark
all read/write accesses with READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE()
to document the fact that the field could be written
without any synchronization.
