net: fixed_phy: Add forward declaration for struct gpio_desc;

Add forward declaration for struct gpio_desc in order to address
the following:

./include/linux/phy_fixed.h:48:17: error: 'struct gpio_desc' declared inside parameter list [-Werror]
./include/linux/phy_fixed.h:48:17: error: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want [-Werror]
