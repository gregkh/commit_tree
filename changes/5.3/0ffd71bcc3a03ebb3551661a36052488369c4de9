staging: erofs: introduce LZ4 decompression inplace

compressed data will be usually loaded into last pages of
the extent (the last page for 4k) for in-place decompression
(more specifically, in-place IO), as ilustration below,

         start of compressed logical extent
           |                          end of this logical extent
           |                           |
     ______v___________________________v________
... |  page 6  |  page 7  |  page 8  |  page 9  | ...
    |__________|__________|__________|__________|
           .                         ^ .        ^
           .                         |compressed|
           .                         |   data   |
           .                           .        .
           |<          dstsize        >|<margin>|
                                       oend     iend
           op                        ip

Therefore, it's possible to do decompression inplace (thus no
memcpy at all) if the margin is sufficient and safe enough [1],
and it can be implemented only for fixed-size output compression
compared with fixed-size input compression.

No memcpy for most of in-place IO (about 99% of enwik9) after
decompression inplace is implemented and sequential read will
be improved of course (see the following patches for test results).
