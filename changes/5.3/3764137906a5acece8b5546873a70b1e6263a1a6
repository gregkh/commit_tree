drm/modes: Introduce a whitelist for the named modes

The named modes support has introduced a number of glitches that were in
part due to the fact that the parser will take any string as a named mode.

Since we shouldn't have a lot of options there (and they should be pretty
standard), let's introduce a whitelist of the available named modes so that
the kernel can differentiate between a poorly formed command line and a
named mode.
