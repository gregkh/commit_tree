net: hns3: use HCLGEVF_STATE_NIC_REGISTERED to indicate VF NIC client has registered

When VF NIC client's init_instance() succeeds, it means this client
has been registered successfully, so we use HCLGEVF_STATE_NIC_REGISTERED
to indicate that. And before calling VF NIC client's uninit_instance(),
we clear this state.

So any operation of VF NIC client from HCLGEVF is not allowed if this
state is not set.
