drm/amd/display: make clk mgr soc specific

[Why]
First step of refactoring clk mgr to better handle different
ways of handling clock operations. Clock operation policies are
soc specific and not just DCN vesion specific. It is not a hw resource,
should not be in the resource pool.

[How]
Change clock manager creation to be based on HW internal ID, rename
clock manager members to be more clear. Move clock manager out of
resource.
