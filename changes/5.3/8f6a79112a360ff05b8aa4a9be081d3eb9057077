drm/komeda: Fix error: not allocating enough data 1592 vs 1584

The patch 5d51f6c0da1b: "drm/komeda: Add writeback support" from May
23, 2019, leads to the following static checker warning:

        drivers/gpu/drm/arm/display/komeda/komeda_wb_connector.c:151 komeda_wb_connector_add()
        error: not allocating enough data 1592 vs 1584

This is a typo which misuse "wb_conn" but which should be "kwb_conn" to
allocate the memory.
