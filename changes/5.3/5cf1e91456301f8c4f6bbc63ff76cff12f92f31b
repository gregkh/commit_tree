bpf: cgroup inet skb programs can return 0 to 3

Allows cgroup inet skb programs to return values in the range [0, 3].
The second bit is used to deterine if congestion occurred and higher
level protocol should decrease rate. E.g. TCP would call tcp_enter_cwr()

The bpf_prog must set expected_attach_type to BPF_CGROUP_INET_EGRESS
at load time if it uses the new return values (i.e. 2 or 3).

The expected_attach_type is currently not enforced for
BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB.  e.g Meaning the current bpf_prog with
expected_attach_type setting to BPF_CGROUP_INET_EGRESS can attach to
BPF_CGROUP_INET_INGRESS.  Blindly enforcing expected_attach_type will
break backward compatibility.

This patch adds a enforce_expected_attach_type bit to only
enforce the expected_attach_type when it uses the new
return value.
