perf tools: Remove old baggage that is util/include/linux/ctype.h

It was just including a ../util.h that wasn't even there:

  $ cat tools/perf/util/include/linux/../util.h
  cat: tools/perf/util/include/linux/../util.h: No such file or directory
  $

This would make kallsyms.h get util.h somehow and then files including
it would get util.h defined stuff, a mess, fix it.
