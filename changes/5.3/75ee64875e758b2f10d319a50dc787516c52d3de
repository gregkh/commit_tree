drm/amdkfd: Consistently apply noretry setting

Apply the same setting to SH_MEM_CONFIG and VM_CONTEXT1_CNTL. This
makes the noretry param no longer KFD-specific. On GFX10 I'm not
changing SH_MEM_CONFIG in this commit because GFX10 has different
retry behaviour in the SQ and I don't have a way to test it at the
moment.
