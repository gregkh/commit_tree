usb: setup authorized_default attributes using usb_bus_notify

Currently, the authorized_default and interface_authorized_default
attributes for HCD are set up after the uevent has been sent to userland.
This creates a race condition where userland may fail to access this
file when processing the event. Move the appending of these attributes
earlier relying on the usb_bus_notify dispatcher.
