regulator: core: Introduce API for regulators coupling customization

Right now regulator core supports only one type of regulators coupling,
the "voltage max-spread" which keeps voltages of coupled regulators in a
given range from each other. A more sophisticated coupling may be required
in practice, one example is the NVIDIA Tegra SoCs which besides the
max-spreading have other restrictions that must be adhered. Introduce API
that allow platforms to provide their own customized coupling algorithms.
