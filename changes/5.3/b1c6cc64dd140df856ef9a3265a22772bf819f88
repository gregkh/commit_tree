media: rockchip/vpu: Open-code media controller register

In preparation to support decoders, using a single memory-to-memory
device, we need to roll our own media controller entities registration.

To do that, we define a rockchip_vpu_func object that embeds the
video_device object plus all the elements that are needed to attach this
vdev to the media device.
