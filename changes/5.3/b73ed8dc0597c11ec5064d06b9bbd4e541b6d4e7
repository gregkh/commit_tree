topology: Create package_cpus sysfs attribute

The existing sysfs cpu/topology/core_siblings (and core_siblings_list)
attributes are documented, implemented, and used by programs to represent
set of logical CPUs sharing the same package.

This makes sense if the next topology level above a core is always a
package.  But on systems where there is a die topology level between a core
and a package, the name and its definition become inconsistent.

So without changing its function, add a name for this map that describes
what it actually is -- package CPUs -- the set of CPUs that share the same
package.

This new name will be immune to changes in topology, since it describes
threads at the current level, not siblings at a contained level.
