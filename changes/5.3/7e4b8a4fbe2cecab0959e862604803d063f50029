dmaengine: Add Synopsys eDMA IP version 0 support

Add support for the eDMA IP version 0 driver for both register maps (legacy
and unroll).

The legacy register mapping was the initial implementation, which consisted
in having all registers belonging to channels multiplexed, which could be
change anytime (which could led a race-condition) by view port register
(access to only one channel available each time).

This register mapping is not very effective and efficient in a multithread
environment, which has led to the development of unroll registers mapping,
which consists of having all channels registers accessible any time by
spreading all channels registers by an offset between them.

This version supports a maximum of 16 independent channels (8 write +
8 read), which can run simultaneously.

Implements a scatter-gather transfer through a linked list, where the size
of linked list depends on the allocated memory divided equally among all
channels.

Each linked list descriptor can transfer from 1 byte to 4 Gbytes and is
alignmented to DWORD.

Both SAR (Source Address Register) and DAR (Destination Address Register)
are alignmented to byte.
