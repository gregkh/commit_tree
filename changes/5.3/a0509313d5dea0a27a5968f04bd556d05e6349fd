arm64/mm: Drop mmap_sem before calling __do_kernel_fault()

There is an inconsistency between down_read_trylock() success and failure
paths while dealing with kernel access for non exception table areas where
it calls __do_kernel_fault(). In case of failure it just bails out without
holding mmap_sem but when it succeeds it does so while holding mmap_sem.
Fix this inconsistency by just dropping mmap_sem in success path as well.

__do_kernel_fault() calls die_kernel_fault() which then calls show_pte().
show_pte() in this path might become bit more unreliable without holding
mmap_sem. But there are already instances [1] in do_page_fault() where
die_kernel_fault() gets called without holding mmap_sem. show_pte() can
be made more robust independently but in a later patch.

[1] Conditional block for (is_ttbr0_addr && is_el1_permission_fault)
