xfs: don't use xfs_trans_free_items in the commit path

While commiting items looks very similar to freeing them on error it is
a different operation, and they will diverge a bit soon.

Split out the commit case from xfs_trans_free_items, inline it into
xfs_log_commit_cil and give it a separate trace point.
