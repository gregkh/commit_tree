PM / QOS: Pass request type to dev_pm_qos_read_value()

In order to allow dev_pm_qos_read_value() to read values for different
QoS requests, pass request type as a parameter to these routines.

For now, it only supports resume-latency request type but will be
extended to frequency limit (min/max) constraints later on.
