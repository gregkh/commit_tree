fscrypt: support encrypting multiple filesystem blocks per page

Rename fscrypt_encrypt_page() to fscrypt_encrypt_pagecache_blocks() and
redefine its behavior to encrypt all filesystem blocks from the given
region of the given page, rather than assuming that the region consists
of just one filesystem block.  Also remove the 'inode' and 'lblk_num'
parameters, since they can be retrieved from the page as it's already
assumed to be a pagecache page.

This is in preparation for allowing encryption on ext4 filesystems with
blocksize != PAGE_SIZE.

This is based on work by Chandan Rajendra.
