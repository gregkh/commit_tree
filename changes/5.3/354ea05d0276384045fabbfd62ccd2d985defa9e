rcutorture: Upper case solves the case of the vanishing NULL pointer

Various security techniques can obfuscate pointer printouts on the
console.  Unfortunately, rcutorture relies on either "null" or all zeroes
to identify the last few statistics printouts at the end of the test.
These need to be identified because failing to do so will results in
false-positive complaints about grace-period hangs.

This commit therefore prints the "ver:" in capitals ("VER:") when
the RCU-protected pointer has been set to NULL, which causes rcutorture's
parse-console.sh script to correctly ignore these lines.
