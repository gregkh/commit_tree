RISC-V: Setup initial page tables in two stages

Currently, the setup_vm() does initial page table setup in one-shot
very early before enabling MMU. Due to this, the setup_vm() has to map
all possible kernel virtual addresses since it does not know size and
location of RAM. This means we have kernel mappings for non-existent
RAM and any buggy driver (or kernel) code doing out-of-bound access
to RAM will not fault and cause underterministic behaviour.

Further, the setup_vm() creates PMD mappings (i.e. 2M mappings) for
RV64 systems. This means for PAGE_OFFSET=0xffffffe000000000 (i.e.
MAXPHYSMEM_128GB=y), the setup_vm() will require 129 pages (i.e.
516 KB) of memory for initial page tables which is never freed. The
memory required for initial page tables will further increase if
we chose a lower value of PAGE_OFFSET (e.g. 0xffffff0000000000)

This patch implements two-staged initial page table setup, as follows:
1. Early (i.e. setup_vm()): This stage maps kernel image and DTB in
a early page table (i.e. early_pg_dir). The early_pg_dir will be used
only by boot HART so it can be freed as-part of init memory free-up.
2. Final (i.e. setup_vm_final()): This stage maps all possible RAM
banks in the final page table (i.e. swapper_pg_dir). The boot HART
will start using swapper_pg_dir at the end of setup_vm_final(). All
non-boot HARTs directly use the swapper_pg_dir created by boot HART.

We have following advantages with this new approach:
1. Kernel mappings for non-existent RAM don't exists anymore.
2. Memory consumed by initial page tables is now indpendent of the
chosen PAGE_OFFSET.
3. Memory consumed by initial page tables on RV64 system is 2 pages
(i.e. 8 KB) which has significantly reduced and these pages will be
freed as-part of the init memory free-up.

The patch also provides a foundation for implementing strict kernel
mappings where we protect kernel text and rodata using PTE permissions.
