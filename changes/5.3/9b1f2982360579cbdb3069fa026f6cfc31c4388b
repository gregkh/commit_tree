net/mlx5: Add support for FW fatal reporter dump

Add support of dump callback for mlx5 FW fatal reporter.
The FW fatal dump uses cr-dump functionality to gather cr-space data for
debug. The cr-dump uses vsc interface which is valid even if the FW
command interface is not functional, which is the case in most FW fatal
errors.

Command example and output:
$ devlink health dump show pci/0000:82:00.0 reporter fw_fatal
 crdump_data:
