cifs: fix rmmod regression in cifs.ko caused by force_sig changes

Fixes: 72abe3bcf091 ("signal/cifs: Fix cifs_put_tcp_session to call send_sig instead of force_sig")

The global change from force_sig caused module unloading of cifs.ko
to fail (since the cifsd process could not be killed, "rmmod cifs"
now would always fail)
