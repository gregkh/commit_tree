staging: bcm2835-camera: Add sanity checks for queue_setup/CREATE_BUFS

Fixes a v4l2-compliance failure when passed a buffer that is
too small.
queue_setup wasn't handling the case where *nplanes != 0, as
used from CREATE_BUFS and requiring the driver to sanity
check the provided buffer parameters. It was assuming that
it was always being used in the REQBUFS case where it provides
the buffer properties.
