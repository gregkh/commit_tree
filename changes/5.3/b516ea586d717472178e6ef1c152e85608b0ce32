PCI: Enable NVIDIA HDA controllers

Many NVIDIA GPUs can be configured as either a single-function video device
or a multi-function device with video at function 0 and an HDA audio
controller at function 1.  The HDA controller can be enabled or disabled by
a bit in the function 0 config space.

Some BIOSes leave the HDA disabled, which means the HDMI connector from the
NVIDIA GPU may not work.  Sometimes the BIOS enables the HDA if an HDMI
cable is connected at boot time, but that doesn't handle hotplug cases.

Enable the HDA controller on device enumeration and resume and re-read the
header type, which tells us whether the GPU is a multi-function device.

This quirk is limited to NVIDIA PCI devices with the VGA Controller device
class.  This is expected to correspond to product configurations where the
NVIDIA GPU has connectors attached.  Other products where the device class
is 3D Controller are expected to correspond to configurations where the
NVIDIA GPU is dedicated (dGPU) and has no connectors.  See original post
(URL below) for more details.

This commit takes inspiration from an earlier patch by Daniel Drake.
