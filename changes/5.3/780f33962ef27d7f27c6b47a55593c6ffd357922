RDMA/hns: Move spin_lock_irqsave to the correct place

When hip08 set gid, it will call spin_unlock_bh when send cmq.  if main.ko
call spin_lock_irqsave firstly, and the kernel is before commit
f71b74bca637 ("irq/softirqs: Use lockdep to assert IRQs are
disabled/enabled"), it will cause WARN_ON_ONCE because of calling
spin_unlock_bh in disable context.

In fact, the spin_lock_irqsave in main.ko is only used for hip06, and
should be placed in hns_roce_hw_v1.c. hns_roce_hw_v2.c uses its own
spin_unlock_bh and does not need main.ko manage spin_lock.
