arm64: irqflags: Introduce explicit debugging for IRQ priorities

Using IRQ priority masking to enable/disable interrupts is a bit
sensitive as it requires to deal with both ICC_PMR_EL1 and PSR.I.

Introduce some validity checks to both highlight the states in which
functions dealing with IRQ enabling/disabling can (not) be called, and
bark a warning when called in an unexpected state.

Since these checks are done on hotpaths, introduce a build option to
choose whether to do the checking.
