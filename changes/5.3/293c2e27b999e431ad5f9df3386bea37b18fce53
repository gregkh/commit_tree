powerpc/64s/exception: simplify hmi control flow

Branch to the relocated 0xc000 address early (still in real mode), to
simplify subsequent branches. Have the virt mode handler avoid just
'windup' and redo the exception from scratch, rather than branching
back to the trampoline.

Rearrange the stack setup instruction location to match the system
reset handler (e.g., right before EXCEPTION_PROLOG_COMMON).
