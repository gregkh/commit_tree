net: hns3: fix __QUEUE_STATE_STACK_XOFF not cleared issue

When change MTU or other operations, which just calling .reset_notify
to do HNAE3_DOWN_CLIENT and HNAE3_UP_CLIENT, then
the netdev_tx_reset_queue() in the hns3_clear_all_ring() will be
ignored. So the dev_watchdog() may misdiagnose a TX timeout.

This patch separates netdev_tx_reset_queue() from
hns3_clear_all_ring(), and unifies hns3_clear_all_ring() and
hns3_force_clear_all_ring into one, since they are doing
similar things.
