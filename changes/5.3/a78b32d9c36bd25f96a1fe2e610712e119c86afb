soundwire: cadence_master: log Slave status mask on errors

The Slave status mask exposes 4 sticky bits. When the device loses
sync, the IP will report two status but the log will only show that
the device lost sync. The status mask has all the information needed
so let's report it instead.

Also change the resolution of the mask, using 64 bits is not needed
when you need 4.
