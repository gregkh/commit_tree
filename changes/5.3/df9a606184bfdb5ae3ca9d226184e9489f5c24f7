scsi: mpt3sas: Use 63-bit DMA addressing on SAS35 HBA

Although SAS3 & SAS3.5 IT HBA controllers support 64-bit DMA addressing, as
per hardware design, if DMA-able range contains all 64-bits
set (0xFFFFFFFF-FFFFFFFF) then it results in a firmware fault.

E.g. SGE's start address is 0xFFFFFFFF-FFFF000 and data length is 0x1000
bytes. when HBA tries to DMA the data at 0xFFFFFFFF-FFFFFFFF location then
HBA will fault the firmware.

Driver will set 63-bit DMA mask to ensure the above address will not be
used.
