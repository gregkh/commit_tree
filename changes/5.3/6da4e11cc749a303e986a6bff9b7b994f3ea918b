ARM: dts: exynos: Add PMU interrupt affinity to Exynos4 boards

Move SoC-specific PMU properties from exynos4.dtsi to respective SoC
(4210 or 4412) so common DTSI would have only common properties.

Define there also interrupt affinity to remove the boot warning message:

    hw perfevents: no interrupt-affinity property for /pmu, guessing.
