devmap: Allow map lookups from eBPF

We don't currently allow lookups into a devmap from eBPF, because the map
lookup returns a pointer directly to the dev->ifindex, which shouldn't be
modifiable from eBPF.

However, being able to do lookups in devmaps is useful to know (e.g.)
whether forwarding to a specific interface is enabled. Currently, programs
work around this by keeping a shadow map of another type which indicates
whether a map index is valid.

Since we now have a flag to make maps read-only from the eBPF side, we can
simply lift the lookup restriction if we make sure this flag is always set.
