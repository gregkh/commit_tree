devlink: add warning in case driver does not set port type

Prevent misbehavior of drivers who would not set port type for longer
period of time. Drivers should always set port type. Do WARN if that
happens.

Note that it is perfectly fine to temporarily not have the type set,
during initialization and port type change.
