[ 3142.970358][ T2649] bcache: bcache_device_free() bcache0 stopped

Here is how the deadlock happens.
1) bcache_reboot() calls bcache_device_stop(), then inside
   bcache_device_stop() BCACHE_DEV_CLOSING bit is set on d->flags.
   Then closure_queue(&d->cl) is called to invoke cached_dev_flush().
2) In cached_dev_flush(), cached_dev_free() is called by continu_at().
3) In cached_dev_free(), when stopping the writeback kthread of the
   cached device by kthread_stop(), dc->writeback_thread will be waken
   up to quite the kthread while-loop, then cached_dev_put() is called
   in bch_writeback_thread().
4) Calling cached_dev_put() in writeback kthread may drop dc->count to
   0, then dc->detach kworker is scheduled, which is initialized as
   cached_dev_detach_finish().
5) Inside cached_dev_detach_finish(), the last line of code is to call
   closure_put(&dc->disk.cl), which drops the last reference counter of
   closrure dc->disk.cl, then the callback cached_dev_flush() gets
   called.
Now cached_dev_flush() is called for second time in the code path, the
first time is in step 2). And again bch_register_lock will be acquired
again, and a A-A lock (lockdep terminology) is happening.

The root cause of the above A-A lock is in cached_dev_free(), mutex
bch_register_lock is held before stopping writeback kthread and other
kworkers. Fortunately now we have variable 'bcache_is_reboot', which may
prevent device registration or unregistration during reboot/shutdown
time, so it is unncessary to hold bch_register_lock such early now.

This is how this patch fixes the reboot/shutdown time A-A lock issue:
After moving mutex_lock(&bch_register_lock) to a later location where
before atomic_read(&dc->running) in cached_dev_free(), such A-A lock
problem can be solved without any reboot time registration race.
