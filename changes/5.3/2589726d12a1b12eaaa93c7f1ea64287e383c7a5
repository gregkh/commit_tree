bpf: introduce bounded loops

Allow the verifier to validate the loops by simulating their execution.
Exisiting programs have used '#pragma unroll' to unroll the loops
by the compiler. Instead let the verifier simulate all iterations
of the loop.
In order to do that introduce parentage chain of bpf_verifier_state and
'branches' counter for the number of branches left to explore.
See more detailed algorithm description in bpf_verifier.h

This algorithm borrows the key idea from Edward Cree approach:

Additional state pruning heuristics make such brute force loop walk
practical even for large loops.
