mfd / platform: cros_ec_debugfs: Expose resume result via debugfs

For ECs that support it, the EC returns the number of slp_s0
transitions and whether or not there was a timeout in the resume
response. Expose the last resume result to usermode via debugfs so
that usermode can detect and report S0ix timeouts.
