net/mlx5e: Encapsulate open/close queues into a function

Create new functions mlx5e_{open,close}_queues to encapsulate opening
and closing RQs and SQs, and call the new functions from
mlx5e_{open,close}_channel. It simplifies the existing functions a bit
and prepares them for the upcoming AF_XDP changes.
