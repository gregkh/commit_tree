dmagengine: pl330: add code to get reset property

The DMA controller on some SoCs can be held in reset, and thus requires
the reset signal(s) to deasserted. Most SoCs will have just one reset
signal, but there are others, i.e. Arria10/Stratix10 will have an
additional reset signal, referred to as the OCP.

Add code to get the reset property from the device tree for deassert and
assert.
