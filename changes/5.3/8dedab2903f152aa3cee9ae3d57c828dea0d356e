staging: bcm2835-camera: Replace spinlock protecting context_map with mutex

The commit "staging: bcm2835-camera: Replace open-coded idr with a struct idr."
replaced an internal implementation of an idr with the standard functions
and a spinlock. idr_alloc(GFP_KERNEL) can sleep whilst calling kmem_cache_alloc
to allocate the new node, but this is not valid whilst in an atomic context
due to the spinlock.

There is no need for this to be a spinlock as a standard mutex is
sufficient.
