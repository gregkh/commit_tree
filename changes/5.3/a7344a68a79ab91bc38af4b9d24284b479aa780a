debugobjects: Less aggressive freeing of excess debug objects

After a system bootup and 3 parallel kernel builds, a partial output
of the debug objects stats file was:

pool_free     :5101
pool_pcp_free :4181
pool_min_free :220
pool_used     :104172
pool_max_used :171920
on_free_list  :0
objs_allocated:39268280
objs_freed    :39160031

More than 39 millions debug objects had since been allocated and then
freed. The pool_max_used, however, was only about 172k. So this is a
lot of extra overhead in freeing and allocating objects from slabs. It
may also causes the slabs to be more fragmented and harder to reclaim.

Make the freeing of excess debug objects less aggressive by freeing them at
a maximum frequency of 10Hz and about 1k objects at each round of freeing.

With that change applied, the partial output of the debug objects stats
file after similar actions became:

pool_free     :5901
pool_pcp_free :3742
pool_min_free :1022
pool_used     :104805
pool_max_used :168081
on_free_list  :0
objs_allocated:5796864
objs_freed    :5687182
