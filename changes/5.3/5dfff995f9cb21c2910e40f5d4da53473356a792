usb: phy: Workaround for USB erratum-A005728

PHY_CLK_VALID bit for UTMI PHY in USBDR does not set even
if PHY is providing valid clock. Workaround for this
involves resetting of PHY and check PHY_CLK_VALID bit
multiple times. If PHY_CLK_VALID bit is still not set even
after 5 retries, it would be safe to deaclare that PHY
clock is not available.
This erratum is applicable for USBDR less then ver 2.4.
