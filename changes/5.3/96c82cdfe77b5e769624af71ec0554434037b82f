net/mlx5: Add fw fatal devlink_health_reporter

Create mlx5_devlink_health_reporter for fw fatal reporter.
The fw fatal reporter is added in addition to the fw reporter and
implements the recover callback.
The point of having two reporters for FW issues, is that we
don't want to run FW recover on any issue, but only fatal ones.
