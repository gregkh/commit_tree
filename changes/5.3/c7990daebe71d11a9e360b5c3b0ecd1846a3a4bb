drm/amd/display: Wait for backlight programming completion in set backlight level

[WHY]
Currently we don't wait for blacklight programming completion in DMCU
when setting backlight level. Some sequences such as PSR static screen
event trigger reprogramming requires it to be complete.

[How]
Add generic wait for dmcu command completion in set backlight level.
