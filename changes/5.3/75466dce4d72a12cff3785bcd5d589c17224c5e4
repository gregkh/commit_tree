bonding: improve event debug usability

Seeing bonding debug log data along the lines of "event: 5" is a bit spartan,
and often requires a lookup table if you don't remember what every event is.
Make use of netdev_cmd_to_name for an improved debugging experience, so for
the prior example, you'll see: "bond_netdev_event received NETDEV_REGISTER"
instead (both are prefixed with the device for which the event pertains).
