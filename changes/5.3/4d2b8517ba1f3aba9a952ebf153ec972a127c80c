IB/rdmavt: Fix variable shadowing issue in rvt_create_cq

The function scoped err variable is uninitialized when the flow jumps into
the if statement. The if scoped err variable shadows the function scoped
err variable, preventing the err assignments within the if statement to be
reflected at the function level, which will cause uninitialized use when
the goto statements are taken.

Just remove the if scoped err declaration so that there is only one copy
of the err variable for this function.
