nvme: Add quirk for LiteON CL1 devices running FW 22301111

One of the components in LiteON CL1 device has limitations that
can be encountered based upon boundary race conditions using the
nvme bus specific suspend to idle flow.

When this situation occurs the drive doesn't resume properly from
suspend-to-idle.

LiteON has confirmed this problem and fixed in the next firmware
version.  As this firmware is already in the field, avoid running
nvme specific suspend to idle flow.

Fixes: d916b1be94b6 ("nvme-pci: use host managed power state for suspend")
