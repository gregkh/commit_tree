spi: sh-msiof: Reduce delays in sh_msiof_modify_ctr_wait()

While the Hardware User Manual does not document the maximum time needed
for modifying bits in the MSIOF Control Register, experiments on R-Car
Gen2/Gen3 and SH-Mobile AG5 revealed the following typical modification
times for the various bits:
  - CTR.TXE and CTR.RXE: no delay,
  - CTR.TSCKE: less than 10 ns,
  - CTR.TFSE: up to a few hundred ns (depending on SPI transfer clock,
    i.e. less for faster transfers).
There are no reasons to believe these figures are different for
SH-MobileR2 SoCs (SH7723/SH7724).

Hence the minimum busy-looping delay of 10 µs is excessive.
Reduce the delay per loop iteration from 10 to 1 us, and the maximum
delay from 1000 to 100 µs.
