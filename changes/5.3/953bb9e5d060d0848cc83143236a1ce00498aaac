staging: kpc2000: kpc_i2c: newline fixups to meet linux style guide

The linux coding style document states:

  1) That braces should not be used where a single single statement
     will do. Therefore all instances of single block statements
     wrapped in braces that do not meet the qualifications of any
     of the exceptions to the rule should be fixed up.

  2) That the declaration of variables local to a given function
     should be immediately followed by a blank newline. Therefore,
     the single instance of this in kpc2000_i2c.c should be fixed
     up.
