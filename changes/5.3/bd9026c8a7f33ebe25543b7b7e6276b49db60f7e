bcache: remove unncessary code in bch_btree_keys_init()

Function bch_btree_keys_init() initializes b->set[].size and
b->set[].data to zero. As the code comments indicates, these code indeed
is unncessary, because both struct btree_keys and struct bset_tree are
nested embedded into struct btree, when struct btree is filled with 0
bits by kzalloc() in mca_bucket_alloc(), b->set[].size and
b->set[].data are initialized to 0 (a.k.a NULL) already.

This patch removes the redundant code, and add comments in
bch_btree_keys_init() and mca_bucket_alloc() to explain why it's safe.
