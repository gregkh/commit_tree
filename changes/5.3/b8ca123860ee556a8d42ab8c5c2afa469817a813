RDMA/mlx5: Cleanup rep when doing unload

When an IB rep is loaded, netdev for the same vport is saved for later
reference. However, it's not cleaned up when doing unload. For ECPF,
kernel crashes when driver is referring to the already removed netdev.

Following steps lead to a shown call trace:
1. Create n VFs from host PF
2. Distroy the VFs
3. Run "rdma link" from ARM

Cleanup the rep and netdev reference when unloading IB rep.
