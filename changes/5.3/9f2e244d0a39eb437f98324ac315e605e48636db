i2c: nvidia-gpu: resume ccgx i2c client

Cypress USB Type-C CCGx controller firmware version 3.1.10
(which is being used in many NVIDIA GPU cards) has known issue of
not triggering interrupt when a USB device is hot plugged to runtime
resume the controller. If any GPU card gets latest kernel with runtime
pm support but does not get latest fixed firmware then also it should
continue to work and therefore a workaround is required to check for
any connector change event

The workaround is to request runtime resume of i2c client
which is UCSI Cypress CCGx driver. CCG driver will call the ISR
for any connector change event only if NVIDIA GPU has old
CCG firmware with the known issue.
