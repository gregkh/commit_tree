clocksource/drivers/sysctr: Add nxp system counter timer driver support

The system counter (sys_ctr) is a programmable system counter
which provides a shared time base to the Cortex A15, A7, A53 etc cores.
It is intended for use in applications where the counter is always
powered on and supports multiple, unrelated clocks. The sys_ctr hardware
supports:
 - 56-bit counter width (roll-over time greater than 40 years)
 - compare frame(64-bit compare value) contains programmable interrupt
   generation when compare value <= counter value.
