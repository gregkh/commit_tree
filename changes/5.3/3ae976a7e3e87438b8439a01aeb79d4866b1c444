rcu: Correctly unlock root node in rcu_check_gp_start_stall()

On systems whose rcu_node tree has only one node, the
rcu_check_gp_start_stall() function's values of rnp and rnp_root will
be identical.  In this case, it clearly does not make sense to release
both rnp->lock and rnp_root->lock, but that is exactly what this function
does in the last early exit.  This commit therefore unlocks only rnp->lock
when rnp and rnp_root are equal.
