ARM: 8864/1: Add workaround for I-Cache line size mismatch between CPU cores

Some big.LITTLE systems have I-Cache line size mismatch between
LITTLE and big cores. This patch adds a workaround for proper I-Cache
support on such systems. Without it, some class of the userspace code
(typically self-modifying) might suffer from random SIGILL failures.

Similar workaround already exists for ARM64 architecture. I has been
added by commit 116c81f427ff ("arm64: Work around systems with mismatched
cache line sizes").
