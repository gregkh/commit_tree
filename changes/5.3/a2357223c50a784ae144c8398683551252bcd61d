binfmt_flat: don't offset the data start

Ever since the initial commit of the binfmt_flat shared library
support back in the bitkeeper days we've offset the actual in-memory
.data start by one field per possible shared library, or 1 in case
shared library support isn't enabled.  I can't find anything in the
loader that actually makes use of it, nor was it present before
shared library support it.
