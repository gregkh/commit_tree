x86/entry/32: Clean up return from interrupt preemption path

The code flow around the return from interrupt preemption point seems
needlessly complicated.

There is only one site jumping to resume_kernel, and none (outside of
resume_kernel) jumping to restore_all_kernel. Inline resume_kernel
in restore_all_kernel and avoid the CONFIG_PREEMPT dependent label.
