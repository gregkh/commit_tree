media: aspeed: use different delays for triggering VE H/W reset

In case of watchdog timeout detected while doing mode detection,
it's better triggering video engine hardware reset immediately so
this commit fixes code for the case. Other than the case, it will
trigger video engine hardware reset after RESOLUTION_CHANGE_DELAY.
