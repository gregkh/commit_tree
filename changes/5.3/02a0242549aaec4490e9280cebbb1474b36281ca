ARM: defconfig: u8500: Add new drivers

This enables the new or updates driver options for U8500
that got merged into v5.3-rc1:

- CMA, MCDE driver, LIMA driver and the Samsung S6D16D0 driver
  enabled by default bringing up the new graphics support.
  Include the LOGO so we can see when the graphics are live.
- We use the IIO hwmon bridge for reflecting temperature
  in the system.
- Set MUSB to PIO mode as this is the one working most stable
  for the time being.
- HWSPINLOCK needs to be set to get the hardware semaphore
  driver to compile and link properly.
