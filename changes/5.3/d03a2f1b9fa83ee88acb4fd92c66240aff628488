xfs: include WARN, REPAIR build options in XFS_BUILD_OPTIONS

The XFS_BUILD_OPTIONS string, shown at module init time and
in modinfo output, does not currently include all available
build options.  So, add in CONFIG_XFS_WARN and CONFIG_XFS_REPAIR.

It has been suggested in some quarters
That this is not enough.
Well ...

Anybody who would like to see this in a sysfs file can send
a patch.  :)
