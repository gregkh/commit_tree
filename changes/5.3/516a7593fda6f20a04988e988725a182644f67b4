xdp: fix leak of IDA cyclic id if rhashtable_insert_slow fails

Fix error handling case, where inserting ID with rhashtable_insert_slow
fails in xdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model, which leads to never releasing the IDA
ID, as the lookup in xdp_rxq_info_unreg_mem_model fails and thus
ida_simple_remove() is never called.

Fix by releasing ID via ida_simple_remove(), and mark xdp_rxq->mem.id with
zero, which is already checked in xdp_rxq_info_unreg_mem_model().
