habanalabs: fix endianness handling for internal QMAN submission

The PQs of internal H/W queues (QMANs) can be located in different memory
areas for different ASICs. Therefore, when writing PQEs, we need to use
the correct function according to the location of the PQ. e.g. if the PQ
is located in the device's memory (SRAM or DRAM), we need to use
memcpy_toio() so it would work in architectures that have separate
address ranges for IO memory.

This patch makes the code that writes the PQE to be ASIC-specific so we
can handle this properly per ASIC.
