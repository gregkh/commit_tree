staging: comedi: dt282x: fix a null pointer deref on interrupt

The interrupt handler `dt282x_interrupt()` causes a null pointer
dereference for those supported boards that have no analog output
support.  For these boards, `dev->write_subdev` will be `NULL` and
therefore the `s_ao` subdevice pointer variable will be `NULL`.  In that
case, the following call near the end of the interrupt handler results
in a null pointer dereference:

	comedi_handle_events(dev, s_ao);

Fix it by only calling the above function if `s_ao` is valid.

(There are other uses of `s_ao` by the interrupt handler that may or may
not be reached depending on values of hardware registers.  Trust that
they are reliable for now.)

Note:
commit 4f6f009b204f ("staging: comedi: dt282x: use comedi_handle_events()")
propagates an earlier error from
commit f21c74fa4cfe ("staging: comedi: dt282x: use cfc_handle_events()").
