remoteproc: qcom: qdsp6-adsp: Add support for QCS404 CDSP

Move the clock list to adsp_pil_data, make the pdc_reset optional and
make the driver directly enable the xo, sleep and core clocks.

The three clocks are previously toggled through the clock controller,
but that means the same hardware block needs to be mapped in both
drivers. Making the remoteproc driver enable the clocks is a nop when
using the clock controller, but allow us to remove the clocks from the
clock controller.
