IB/mlx5: Fix RSS Toeplitz setup to be aligned with the HW specification

The specification for the Toeplitz function doesn't require to set the key
explicitly to be symmetric. In case a symmetric functionality is required
a symmetric key can be simply used.

Wrongly forcing the algorithm to symmetric causes the wrong packet
distribution and a performance degradation.
