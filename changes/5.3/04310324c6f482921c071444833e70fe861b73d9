s390/qdio: handle PENDING state for QEBSM devices

When a CQ-enabled device uses QEBSM for SBAL state inspection,
get_buf_states() can return the PENDING state for an Output Queue.
get_outbound_buffer_frontier() isn't prepared for this, and any PENDING
buffer will permanently stall all further completion processing on this
Queue.

This isn't a concern for non-QEBSM devices, as get_buf_states() for such
devices will manually turn PENDING buffers into EMPTY ones.
