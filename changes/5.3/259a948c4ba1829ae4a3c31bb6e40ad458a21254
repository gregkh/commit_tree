powerpc/pseries/scm: Use a specific endian format for storing uuid from the device tree

We used uuid_parse to convert uuid string from device tree to two u64
components. We want to make sure we look at the uuid read from device
tree in an endian-neutral fashion. For now, I am picking little-endian
to be format so that we don't end up doing an additional conversion.

The reason to store in a specific endian format is to enable reading
the namespace created with a little-endian kernel config on a
big-endian kernel. We do store the device tree uuid string as a 64-bit
little-endian cookie in the label area. When booting the kernel we
also compare this cookie against what is read from the device tree.
For this, to work we have to store and compare these values in a CPU
endian config independent fashion.
