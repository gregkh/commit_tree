platform/chrome: wilco_ec: Add circular buffer as event queue

The current implementation of the event queue both
wastes space using a doubly linked list and isn't super
obvious in how it behaves. This converts the queue to an
actual circular buffer. The size of the queue is a
tunable module parameter. This also fixes a few other things:

- A memory leak that occurred when the ACPI device was
  removed, but the events were not freed from the queue.
- Now kfree() the oldest event from outside all locks.
- Add newline to logging messages.
- Add helper macros to calculate size of events.
- Remove unneeded lock around a check for dev_data->exist
  in hangup_device().
- Remove an unneeded null event pointer check in enqueue_events().
- Correct some comments.
