KVM: arm/arm64: Re-create event when setting counter value

The perf event sample_period is currently set based upon the current
counter value, when PMXEVTYPER is written to and the perf event is created.
However the user may choose to write the type before the counter value in
which case sample_period will be set incorrectly. Let's instead decouple
event creation from PMXEVTYPER and (re)create the event in either
suitation.
