net: hns3: enable broadcast promisc mode when initializing VF

For revision 0x20, the broadcast promisc is enabled by firmware,
it's unnecessary to enable it when initializing VF.

For revision 0x21, it's necessary to enable broadcast promisc mode
when initializing or re-initializing VF, otherwise, it will be
unable to send and receive promisc packets.
