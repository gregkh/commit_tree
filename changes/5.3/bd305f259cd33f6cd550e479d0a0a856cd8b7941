kconfig: make arch/*/configs/defconfig the default of KBUILD_DEFCONFIG

Until recently, if KBUILD_DEFCONFIG was not set by the arch Makefile,
the default path arch/*/defconfig was used.

The last users of the default are gone by the following commits:

- Commit f3e20ad67b4c ("s390: move arch/s390/defconfig to
  arch/s390/configs/defconfig")

- Commit 986a13769c4b ("alpha: move arch/alpha/defconfig to
  arch/alpha/configs/defconfig")

Let's set arch/*/configs/defconfig as a new default. This saves
KBUILD_DEFCONFIG for some architectures.
