linux/dim: Implement RDMA adaptive moderation (DIM)

RDMA DIM implements a different algorithm from net DIM and is based on
completions which is how we can implement interrupt moderation in RDMA.

The algorithm optimizes for number of completions and ratio between
completions and events. In order to avoid long latencies, the
implementation performs fast reduction of moderation level when the
traffic changes.
