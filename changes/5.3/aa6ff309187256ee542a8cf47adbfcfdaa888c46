scsi: lpfc: Fix BFS crash with DIX enabled

Crashes in scsi_queue_rq or in dma_unmap_direct_sg during BFS when lpfc has
lpfc_enable_bg=1.

lpfc is setting DIX and prot sg after scsi_add_host_with_dma() has been
called. The scsi_host_set_prot() and scsi_host_set_guard() routines need to
be called before scsi_add_host_with_dma().

Revise the calling sequence to set the protection/guard data before calling
scsi_add_host_with_dma().
