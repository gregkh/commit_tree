drm/i915: Make pipe_config_err() vs. fastset less confusing

Rename pipe_config_err() to pipe_config_mismatch(), and also print
whether we're doing the fastset check or the sw vs. hw state readout
check. Should make the logs a bit less confusing when they're not
filled with what looks like a real error.

Also rename the 'adjust' variable to 'fastset' to make it clear what
it means.
