drm/modes: Fix the command line parser to take force options into account

The command line parser when it has been rewritten introduced a regression
when the only thing on the command line is an option to force the detection
of a connector (such as video=HDMI-A-1:d), which are completely valid.

It's been further broken by the support for the named modes which take
anything that is not a resolution as a named mode.

Let's fix this by running the extra command line option parser on the named
modes if they only take a single character.
