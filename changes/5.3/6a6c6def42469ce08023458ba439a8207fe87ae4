xprtrdma: Refactor chunk encoding

Clean up.

Move the "not present" case into the individual chunk encoders. This
improves code organization and readability.

The reason for the original organization was to optimize for the
case where there there are no chunks. The optimization turned out to
be inconsequential, so let's err on the side of code readability.
