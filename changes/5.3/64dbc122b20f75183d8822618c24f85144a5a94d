x86/entry/64: Use JMP instead of JMPQ

Somehow the swapgs mitigation entry code patch ended up with a JMPQ
instruction instead of JMP, where only the short jump is needed.  Some
assembler versions apparently fail to optimize JMPQ into a two-byte JMP
when possible, instead always using a 7-byte JMP with relocation.  For
some reason that makes the entry code explode with a #GP during boot.

Change it back to "JMP" as originally intended.
