x86/MCE: Make mce_banks a per-CPU array

Current AMD systems have unique MCA banks per logical CPU even though
the type of the banks may all align to the same bank number. Each CPU
will have control of a set of MCA banks in the hardware and these are
not shared with other CPUs.

For example, bank 0 may be the Load-Store Unit on every logical CPU, but
each bank 0 is a unique structure in the hardware. In other words, there
isn't a *single* Load-Store Unit at MCA bank 0 that all logical CPUs
share.

This idea extends even to non-core MCA banks. For example, CPU0 and CPU4
may see a Unified Memory Controller at bank 15, but each CPU is actually
seeing a unique hardware structure that is not shared with other CPUs.

Because the MCA banks are all unique hardware structures, it would be
good to control them in a more granular way. For example, if there is a
known issue with the Floating Point Unit on CPU5 and a user wishes to
disable an error type on the Floating Point Unit, then it would be good
to do this only for CPU5 rather than all CPUs.

Also, future AMD systems may have heterogeneous MCA banks. Meaning
the bank numbers may not necessarily represent the same types between
CPUs. For example, bank 20 visible to CPU0 may be a Unified Memory
Controller and bank 20 visible to CPU4 may be a Coherent Slave. So
granular control will be even more necessary should the user wish to
control specific MCA banks.

Split the device attributes from struct mce_bank leaving only the MCA
bank control fields.

Make struct mce_banks[] per_cpu in order to have more granular control
over individual MCA banks in the hardware.

Allocate the device attributes statically based on the maximum number of
MCA banks supported. The sysfs interface will use as many as needed per
CPU. Currently, this is set to mca_cfg.banks, but will be changed to a
per_cpu bank count in a future patch.

Allocate the MCA control bits statically. This is in order to avoid
locking warnings when memory is allocated during secondary CPUs' init
sequences.

Also, remove the now unnecessary return values from
__mcheck_cpu_mce_banks_init() and __mcheck_cpu_cap_init().

Redo the sysfs store/show functions to handle the per_cpu mce_banks[].
