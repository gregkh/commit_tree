i2c: iop: Use GPIO descriptors

The IOP3xx has some elaborate code to directly slam the
GPIO lines multiplexed with I2C down low before enablement,
apparently a workaround for a hardware bug found in the
early chips.

After consulting the developer documentation for IOP80321
and IOP80331 I can clearly see that this may be useful for
IOP80321 family (mach-iop32x) but it is highly dubious for
any 80331 series or later chip: in these chips the lines
are not multiplexed for UARTs.

We convert the code to pass optional GPIO descriptors
and register these only on the 80321-based boards where
it makes sense, optionally obtain them in the driver and
use the gpiod_set_raw_value() to ascertain the line gets
driven low when needed.

The GPIO driver does not give the GPIO chip a reasonable
label so the patch also adds that so that these machine
descriptor tables can be used.
