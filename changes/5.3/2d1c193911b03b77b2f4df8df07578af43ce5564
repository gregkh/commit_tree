nvmem: Broaden the selection of NVMEM_SNVS_LPGPR

The SNVS LPGR IP block is also found on other i.MX SoCs that
are not covered by the current SOC_IMX6 || SOC_IMX7D logic.

One example is the i.MX7ULP.

To avoid keep expanding the SoC logic selection, make it broader
by using the more generic ARCH_MXC symbol instead.
