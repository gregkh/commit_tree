vfs: introduce generic_copy_file_range()

Right now if vfs_copy_file_range() does not use any offload
mechanism, it falls back to calling do_splice_direct(). This fails
to do basic sanity checks on the files being copied. Before we
start adding this necessarily functionality to the fallback path,
separate it out into generic_copy_file_range().

generic_copy_file_range() has the same prototype as
->copy_file_range() so that filesystems can use it in their custom
->copy_file_range() method if they so choose.
