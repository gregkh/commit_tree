perf db-export: Get rid of db_export__deferred()

db_export__deferred() deferred the export of comms if the comm string
had not been "set" (changed from :<pid>) however that problem was fixed
a long time ago by commit e803cf97a4f9 ("perf record: Synthesize COMM
event for a command line workload"), so get rid of
db_export__deferred().
