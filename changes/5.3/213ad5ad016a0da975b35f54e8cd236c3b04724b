habanalabs: fix endianness handling for packets from user

Packets that arrive from the user and need to be parsed by the driver are
assumed to be in LE format.

This patch fix all the places where the code handles these packets and use
the correct endianness macros to handle them, as the driver handles the
packets in CPU format (LE or BE depending on the arch).
