ALSA: dice: code refactoring to stop packet streaming

This commit is a part of preparation to perform allocation/release
of isochronous resources in pcm.hw_params/hw_free callbacks.

There're three points to finish packet streaming but no helper
functions for common operations for it. This commit adds a helper
function for operations to finish packet streaming.
