riscv: include generic support for MSI irqdomains

Some RISC-V systems include PCIe host controllers that support PCIe
message-signaled interrupts.  For this to work on Linux, we need to
enable PCI_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN and define struct msi_alloc_info.  Support
for the latter is enabled by including the architecture-generic msi.h
include.
