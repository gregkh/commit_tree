ASoC: madera: Add common support for Cirrus Logic Madera codecs

The Cirrus Logic Madera codecs are a family of related codecs with
extensive digital and analogue I/O, digital mixing and routing,
signal processing and programmable DSPs. This patch adds common
support code shared by all Madera codecs.

This patch also adds the pdata to the parent mfd pdata struct.
Since there is a circular build dependency it's convenient to
patch them both atomically.
