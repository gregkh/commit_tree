media: Revert "[media] marvell-ccic: reset ccic phy when stop streaming for stability"

This accesses the clock registers directly and thus is going to stay in the
way of making the driver devicetree friendly.

No boards seems to actually use this. If it's somehow actually needed it
needs to be done differently.

This reverts commit 7c269f454e7a51b151d94f99344120efa1cd0acb.
