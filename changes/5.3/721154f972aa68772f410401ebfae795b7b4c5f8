clocksource/drivers/davinci: Add support for clockevents

Currently the clocksource and clockevent support for davinci platforms
lives in mach-davinci. It hard-codes many things, uses global variables,
implements functionalities unused by any platform and has code fragments
scattered across many (often unrelated) files.

Implement a new, modern and simplified timer driver and put it into
drivers/clocksource. We still need to support legacy board files so
export a config structure and a function that allows machine code to
register the timer.

The timer we're using is 64-bit but can be programmed in dual 32-bit
mode (both chained and unchained).

On all davinci SoCs except for da830 we're using both halves. Lower half
for clockevents and upper half for clocksource. On da830 we're using the
lower half for both with the help of a compare register.

This patch contains the core code and support for clockevent. The
clocksource code will be included in a subsequent patch.
