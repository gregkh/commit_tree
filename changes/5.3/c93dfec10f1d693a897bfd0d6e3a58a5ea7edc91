net/mlx5e: Fix compilation error in TLS code

In the cited patch below, the Kconfig flags combination of:
CONFIG_MLX5_FPGA is not set
CONFIG_MLX5_TLS=y
CONFIG_MLX5_EN_TLS=y

leads to the compilation error:

./include/linux/mlx5/device.h:61:39: error: invalid application of
sizeof to incomplete type struct mlx5_ifc_tls_flow_bits.

Fix it.
