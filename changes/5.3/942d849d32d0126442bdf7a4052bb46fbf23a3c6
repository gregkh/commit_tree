crypto: inside-secure - improve the result error format when displayed

The result descriptors contain errors, which are represented as a
bitmap. This patch updates the error message to not treat the error as a
decimal value, but as an hexadecimal one. This helps in knowing the
value does not have a direct meaning (the set bits themselves have).
