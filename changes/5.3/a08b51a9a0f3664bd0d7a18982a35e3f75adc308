habanalabs: change polling functions to macros

This patch changes two polling functions to macros, in order to make their
API the same as the standard readl_poll_timeout so we would be able to
define the "condition for exit" when calling these macros.

This will simplify the code as it will eliminate the need to check both
for timeout and for the (cond) in the calling function.
