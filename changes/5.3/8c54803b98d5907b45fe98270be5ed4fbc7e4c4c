null_blk: remove duplicate 0 initialization

In function null_add_dev() struct nullb *nullb member is allocated
using kzalloc_node() which returns 0red memory.

In function setup_queues() which is called from the null_add_dev(), on
successful queue allocation we set the nullb->nr_queues = 0 which is not
needed due to earlier use of kzalloc_node().
