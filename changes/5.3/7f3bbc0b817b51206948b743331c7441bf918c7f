drm/modes: Skip invalid cmdline mode

The named mode could be invalid and then cmdline parser misses to validate
mode's dimensions, happily adding 0x0 mode as a valid mode. One case where
this happens is NVIDIA Tegra devices that are using downstream bootloader
which adds "video=tegrafb" to the kernel's cmdline and thus upstream Tegra
DRM driver fails to probe because of the invalid mode.
