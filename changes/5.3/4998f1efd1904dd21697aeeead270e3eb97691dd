usb: Add devaddr in struct usb_device

The Clear_TT_Buffer request sent to the hub includes the address of
the LS/FS child device in wValue field. usb_hub_clear_tt_buffer()
uses udev->devnum to set the address wValue. This won't work for
devices connected to xHC.

For other host controllers udev->devnum is the same as the address of
the usb device, chosen and set by usb core. With xHC the controller
hardware assigns the address, and won't be the same as devnum.

Here we add devaddr in "struct usb_device" for
usb_hub_clear_tt_buffer() to use.
