net: dsa: vsc73xx: Split vsc73xx driver

This driver (currently) only takes control of the switch chip over
SPI and configures it to route packages around when connected to a
CPU port. But Vitesse chip support also parallel interface.

This patch split driver into two parts: core and spi. It is required
for add support to another managing interface.
