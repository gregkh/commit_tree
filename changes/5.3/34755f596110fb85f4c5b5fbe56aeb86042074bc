IB/rdmavt: Use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(struct rvt_sge) * init_attr->cap.max_send_sge + sizeof(struct rvt_swqe)

with:

struct_size(swq, sg_list, init_attr->cap.max_send_sge)

and so on...

Also, notice that variable size is unnecessary, hence it is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
