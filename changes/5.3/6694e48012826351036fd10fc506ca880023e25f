KVM: nVMX: Ignore segment base for VMX memory operand when segment not FS or GS

As reported by Maxime at
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204175:

In vmx/nested.c::get_vmx_mem_address(), when the guest runs in long mode,
the base address of the memory operand is computed with a simple:
    *ret = s.base + off;

This is incorrect, the base applies only to FS and GS, not to the others.
Because of that, if the guest uses a VMX instruction based on DS and has
a DS.base that is non-zero, KVM wrongfully adds the base to the
resulting address.
