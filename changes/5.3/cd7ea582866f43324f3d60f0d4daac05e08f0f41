opp: Make dev_pm_opp_set_rate() handle freq = 0 to drop performance votes

For devices with performance state, we use dev_pm_opp_set_rate() to set
the appropriate clk rate and the performance state.

We do need a way to remove the performance state vote when we idle the
device and turn the clocks off. Use dev_pm_opp_set_rate() with freq = 0
to achieve this.
