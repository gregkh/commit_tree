page_pool: fix compile warning when CONFIG_PAGE_POOL is disabled

Kbuild test robot reported compile warning:
 warning: no return statement in function returning non-void
in function page_pool_request_shutdown, when CONFIG_PAGE_POOL is disabled.

The fix makes the code a little more verbose, with a descriptive variable.
