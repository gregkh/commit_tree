staging: vchiq: make wait events interruptible

The killable version of wait_event() is meant to be used on situations
where it should not fail at all costs, but still have the convenience of
being able to kill it if really necessary. Wait events in VCHIQ doesn't
fit this criteria, as it's mainly used as an interface to V4L2 and ALSA
devices.
