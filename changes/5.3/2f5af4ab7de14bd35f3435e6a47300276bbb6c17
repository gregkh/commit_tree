lightnvm: fix uninitialized pointer in nvm_remove_tgt()

With gcc 4.1:

    drivers/lightnvm/core.c: In function ‘nvm_remove_tgt’:
    drivers/lightnvm/core.c:510: warning: ‘t’ is used uninitialized in this function

Indeed, if no NVM devices have been registered, t will be an
uninitialized pointer, and may be dereferenced later.  A call to
nvm_remove_tgt() can be triggered from userspace by issuing the
NVM_DEV_REMOVE ioctl on the lightnvm control device.

Fix this by preinitializing t to NULL.
