clk: meson: g12a: Add support for G12B CPUB clocks

Update the Meson G12A Clock driver to support the Amlogic G12B SoC.

G12B clock driver is very close, the main differences are :
- the clock tree is duplicated for the both clusters, and the
  SYS_PLL are swapped between the clusters
- G12B has additional clocks like for CSI an other components

Here only the cpu clock tree is handled.
