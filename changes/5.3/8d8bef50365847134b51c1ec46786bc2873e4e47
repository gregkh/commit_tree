spi: bcm2835: Fix 3-wire mode if DMA is enabled

Commit 6935224da248 ("spi: bcm2835: enable support of 3-wire mode")
added 3-wire support to the BCM2835 SPI driver by setting the REN bit
(Read Enable) in the CS register when receiving data.  The REN bit puts
the transmitter in high-impedance state.  The driver recognizes that
data is to be received by checking whether the rx_buf of a transfer is
non-NULL.

Commit 3ecd37edaa2a ("spi: bcm2835: enable dma modes for transfers
meeting certain conditions") subsequently broke 3-wire support because
it set the SPI_MASTER_MUST_RX flag which causes spi_map_msg() to replace
rx_buf with a dummy buffer if it is NULL.  As a result, rx_buf is
*always* non-NULL if DMA is enabled.

Reinstate 3-wire support by not only checking whether rx_buf is non-NULL,
but also checking that it is not the dummy buffer.
