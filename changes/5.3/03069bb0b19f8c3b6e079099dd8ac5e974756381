arm: remove ARCH_SELECT_MEMORY_MODEL

Patch series "remove ARCH_SELECT_MEMORY_MODEL where it has no effect".

For several architectures the ARCH_SELECT_MEMORY_MODEL has no real effect
because the dependencies for the memory model are always evaluated to a
single value.

Remove the ARCH_SELECT_MEMORY_MODEL from the Kconfigs for these
architectures.

This patch (of 3):

The ARCH_SELECT_MEMORY_MODEL in arch/arm/Kconfig is enabled only when
ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE=y.  But in this case, ARCH_SPARSEMEM_DEFAULT is also
enabled and this in turn enables SPARSEMEM_MANUAL.

Since there is no definition of ARCH_FLATMEM_ENABLE in arch/arm/Kconfig,
SPARSEMEM_MANUAL is the only enabled memory model, hence the final
selection will evaluate to SPARSEMEM=y.

Since ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE is set to 'y' only by several sub-arch
configurations, the default for must sub-arches would be the falback to
FLATMEM regardless of ARCH_SELECT_MEMORY_MODEL.
