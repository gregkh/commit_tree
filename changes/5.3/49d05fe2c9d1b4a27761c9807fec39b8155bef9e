ipv6: rt6_check should return NULL if 'from' is NULL

Paul reported that l2tp sessions were broken after the commit referenced
in the Fixes tag. Prior to this commit rt6_check returned NULL if the
rt6_info 'from' was NULL - ie., the dst_entry was disconnected from a FIB
entry. Restore that behavior.

Fixes: 93531c674315 ("net/ipv6: separate handling of FIB entries from dst based routes")
