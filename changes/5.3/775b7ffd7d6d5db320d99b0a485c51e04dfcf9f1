serial: sh-sci: Terminate TX DMA during buffer flushing

While the .flush_buffer() callback clears sci_port.tx_dma_len since
commit 1cf4a7efdc71cab8 ("serial: sh-sci: Fix race condition causing
garbage during shutdown"), it does not terminate a transmit DMA
operation that may be in progress.

Fix this by terminating any pending DMA operations, and resetting the
corresponding cookie.
