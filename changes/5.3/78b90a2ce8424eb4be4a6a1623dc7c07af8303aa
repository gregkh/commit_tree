block: genhd: Use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*new_ptbl) + target * sizeof(new_ptbl->part[0])

with:

struct_size(new_ptbl, part, target)

Also, notice that variable size is unnecessary, hence it is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
