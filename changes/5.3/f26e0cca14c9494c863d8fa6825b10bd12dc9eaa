net: dsa: qca8k: Add of_node_put() in qca8k_setup_mdio_bus()

Each iteration of for_each_available_child_of_node() puts the previous
node, but in the case of a return from the middle of the loop, there
is no put, thus causing a memory leak. Hence add an of_node_put() before
the return.
Additionally, the local variable ports in the function
qca8k_setup_mdio_bus() takes the return value of of_get_child_by_name(),
which gets a node but does not put it. If the function returns without
putting ports, it may cause a memory leak. Hence put ports before the
mid-loop return statement, and also outside the loop after its last usage
in this function.
Issues found with Coccinelle.
