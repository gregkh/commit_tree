batman-adv: mcast: collect softif listeners from IP lists instead

Instead of collecting multicast MAC addresses from the netdev hw mc
list collect a node's multicast listeners from the IP lists and convert
those to MAC addresses.

This allows to exclude addresses of specific scope later. On a
multicast MAC address the IP destination scope is not visible anymore.
