vfio-ccw: Fix the conversion of Format-0 CCWs to Format-1

When processing Format-0 CCWs, we use the "len" variable as the
number of CCWs to convert to Format-1.  But that variable
contains zero here, and is not a meaningful CCW count until
ccwchain_calc_length() returns.  Since that routine requires and
expects Format-1 CCWs to identify the chaining behavior, the
format conversion must be done first.

Convert the 2KB we copied even if it's more than we need.
