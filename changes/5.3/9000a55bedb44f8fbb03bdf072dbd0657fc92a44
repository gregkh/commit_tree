arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-mtp: Make USB1 peripheral

The MTP is a "mobile reference device", as such the default operation is
to use fastboot to boot/flash software onto it and the common case is
thereby that we boot with a USB cable connected downstream from a PC or
a hub.  And without support for the PMI8998 charger block VBUS will not
be driven by the device.

Switch to peripheral until we can enable OTG.
