platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: transform Pkg C-state residency from TSC ticks into microseconds

Refer to the Intel SDM Vol.4, the package C-state residency counters
of modern IA micro-architecture are all ticking in TSC frequency,
hence we can apply simple math to transform the ticks into microseconds.
i.e.,
residency (ms) = count / tsc_khz
residency (us) = count / tsc_khz * 1000

This also aligns to other sysfs debug entries of residency counter in
the same metric in microseconds, benefits reading and scripting.

v2: restore the accidentally deleted newline, no function change.
v3: apply kernel do_div() macro to calculate division
