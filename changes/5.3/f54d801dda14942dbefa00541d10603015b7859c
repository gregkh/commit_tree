bcache: destroy dc->writeback_write_wq if failed to create dc->writeback_thread

Commit 9baf30972b55 ("bcache: fix for gc and write-back race") added a
new work queue dc->writeback_write_wq, but forgot to destroy it in the
error condition when creating dc->writeback_thread failed.

This patch destroys dc->writeback_write_wq if kthread_create() returns
error pointer to dc->writeback_thread, then a memory leak is avoided.
