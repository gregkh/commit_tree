net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: introduce support for two chips using direct smi addressing

The 88e6250 (as well as 6220, 6071, 6070, 6020) do not support
multi-chip (indirect) addressing. However, one can still have two of
them on the same mdio bus, since the device only uses 16 of the 32
possible addresses, either addresses 0x00-0x0F or 0x10-0x1F depending
on the ADDR4 pin at reset [since ADDR4 is internally pulled high, the
latter is the default].

In order to prepare for supporting the 88e6250 and friends, introduce
mv88e6xxx_info::dual_chip to allow having a non-zero sw_addr while
still using direct addressing.
