kvm: x86: Fix -Wmissing-prototypes warnings

We get a warning when build kernel W=1:

arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/eventfd.c:48:1: warning: no previous prototype for ‘kvm_arch_irqfd_allowed’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
 kvm_arch_irqfd_allowed(struct kvm *kvm, struct kvm_irqfd *args)
 ^

The reason is kvm_arch_irqfd_allowed() is declared in arch/x86/kvm/irq.h,
which is not included by eventfd.c. Considering kvm_arch_irqfd_allowed()
is a weakly defined function in eventfd.c, remove the declaration to
kvm_host.h can fix this.
