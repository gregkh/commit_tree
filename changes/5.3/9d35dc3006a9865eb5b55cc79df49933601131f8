csky: Revert mmu ASID mechanism

Current C-SKY ASID mechanism is from mips and it doesn't work well
with multi-cores. ASID per core mechanism is not suitable for C-SKY
SMP tlb maintain operations, eg: tlbi.vas need share the same asid
in all processors and it'll invalid the tlb entry in all cores with
the same asid.

This patch is prepare for new ASID mechanism.
