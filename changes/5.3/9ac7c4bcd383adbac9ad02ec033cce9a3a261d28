RDMA/mlx5: Pass UMR segment flags instead of boolean

UMR ctrl segment flags can vary between UMR operations. for example,
using inline UMR or adding free/not-free checks for a memory key.
This is a preparation commit before adding new signature API that
will not need not-free checks for the internal memory key during the
UMR operation.
