mmc: sdhci_am654: Add Support for 8 bit IP on J721E

The 8 bit IP on the TI's J721E device departs from the AM654x IP in some
ways which require special handling. Create a driver_data structure
which holds the pltfm_data and a flags field which is used to indicate
these differences. These are the following:

1. The pins are not muxed with anything else inside the SoC and hence the
   IOMUX_ENABLE field does not exist. Add a flag which is used to
   indicate the presence of the field.

2. The register field used to select DLL frequency is 3 bit wide as
   compared to 2 bits in AM65x. Add another flag which differentiates
   between 3 bit and 2 bit fields.

3. The strobe select field is 8 bit wide as compared to 4 bits for
   AM65x. Add yet another flag to indicate this difference. Strobe select
   is used only for HS400 speed mode, support for which has not yet been
   added in AM65x.
