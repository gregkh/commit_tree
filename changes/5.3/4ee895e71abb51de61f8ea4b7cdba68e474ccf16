media: vivid: reorder CEC allocation and control set-up

CEC adapters and controllers (handlers) are now set up as follows:

1. Allocate CEC adapters: setup of control handlers in next step
   requires these adapters to be allocated.
2. Setup of control handlers: This must be done prior to registering
   and exposing the adapters to user space to avoid a race condition.
3. Register CEC adapters: make them available to user space.
