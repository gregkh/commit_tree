scsi: ufs: Add error-handling of Auto-Hibernate

Currently auto-hibernate is activated if host supports auto-hibern8
capability. However error-handling is not implemented, which makes the
feature somewhat risky.

If either "Hibernate Enter" or "Hibernate Exit" fail during auto-hibernate
flow, the corresponding interrupt "UIC_HIBERNATE_ENTER" or
"UIC_HIBERNATE_EXIT" shall be raised according to UFS specification.

This patch adds auto-hibernate error-handling:

 - Monitor "Hibernate Enter" and "Hibernate Exit" interrupts after
   auto-hibernate feature is activated.

 - If a failure happens, trigger error-handling just like
   "manual-hibernate" failure and apply the same recovery flow: schedule
   UFS error handler in ufshcd_check_errors(), and then do host reset and
   restore in UFS error handler.
