platform/x86: ISST: Add common API to register and handle ioctls

Encapsulate common functions which all Intel Speed Select Technology
interface drivers can use. This creates API to register misc device for
user kernel communication and handle all common IOCTLs. As part of the
registry it allows a callback which is to handle domain specific ioctl
processing.

There can be multiple drivers register for services, which can be built
as modules. So this driver handle contention during registry and as well
as during removal. Once user space opened the misc device, the registered
driver will be prevented from removal. Also once misc device is opened by
the user space new client driver can't register, till the misc device is
closed.

There are two types of client drivers, one to handle mail box interface
and the other is to allow direct read/write to some specific MMIO space.

This common driver implements IOCTL ISST_IF_GET_PLATFORM_INFO.
