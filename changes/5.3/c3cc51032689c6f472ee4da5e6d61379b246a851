media: marvell-ccic: don't generate EOF on parallel bus

The commit
05fed81625bf ("[media] marvell-ccic: add MIPI support for marvell-ccic driver")
that claimed to add CSI2 turned on C0_EOF_VSYNC for parallel bus
without a very good explanation.

That broke camera on OLPC XO-1.75 which precisely uses a sensor on a
parallel bus. Revert that chunk.

Tested on an OLPC XO-1.75.
