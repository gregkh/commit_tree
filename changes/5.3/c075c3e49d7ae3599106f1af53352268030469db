KVM: nVMX: Use adjusted pin controls for vmcs02

KVM provides a module parameter to allow disabling virtual NMI support
to simplify testing (hardware *without* virtual NMI support is hard to
come by but it does have users).  When preparing vmcs02, use the accessor
for pin controls to ensure that the module param is respected for nested
guests.

Opportunistically swap the order of applying L0's and L1's pin controls
to better align with other controls and to prepare for a future patche
that will ignore L1's, but not L0's, preemption timer flag.
