bus: ti-sysc: Handle swsup idle mode quirks

Some modules have idlemodes wired, but not completely functional. We have
quirks for SWSUP_SIDLE and SWSUP_SIDLE_ACT to manage interconnect target
modules without hardware support, but we've been only using them so far
in legacy mode. Let's add support for SWSUP quirks in non-legacy mode too.
