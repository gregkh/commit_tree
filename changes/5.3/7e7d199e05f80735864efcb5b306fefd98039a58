One way to fix these warnings is to add additional braces like Clang
suggests; however, there has been a bit of push back from some
maintainers[1][2], who just prefer memset as it is unambiguous, doesn't
depend on a particular compiler version[3], and properly initializes all
subobjects. Do that here so there are no more warnings.
