perf trace beauty clone: Handle CLONE_PIDFD

In addition to the older flags. This will allow something like this to
be implemented in 'perf trace"

  perf trace -e clone/PIDFD in flags/

I.e. ask for strace like tracing, system wide, looking for 'clone'
syscalls that have the CLONE_PIDFD bit set in the 'flags' arg.

For now we'll just see PIDFD if it is set in the 'flags' arg.
