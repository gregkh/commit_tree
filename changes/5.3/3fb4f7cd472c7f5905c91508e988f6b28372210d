tools/power/x86: A tool to validate Intel Speed Select commands

The Intel(R) Speed select technologies contains four features.

Performance profile:An non architectural mechanism that allows multiple
optimized performance profiles per system via static and/or dynamic
adjustment of core count, workload, Tjmax, and TDP, etc. aka ISS
in the documentation.

Base Frequency: Enables users to increase guaranteed base frequency on
certain cores (high priority cores) in exchange for lower base frequency
on remaining cores (low priority cores). aka PBF in the documenation.

Turbo frequency: Enables the ability to set different turbo ratio limits
to cores based on priority. aka FACT in the documentation.

Core power: An Interface that allows user to define per core/tile
priority.

There is a multi level help for commands and options. This can be used
to check required arguments for each feature and commands for the
feature.

To start navigating the features start with

$sudo intel-speed-select --help

For help on a specific feature for example
$sudo intel-speed-select perf-profile --help

To get help for a command for a feature for example
$sudo intel-speed-select perf-profile get-lock-status --help
