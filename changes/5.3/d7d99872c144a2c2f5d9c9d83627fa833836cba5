netns: add pre_exit method to struct pernet_operations

Current struct pernet_operations exit() handlers are highly
discouraged to call synchronize_rcu().

There are cases where we need them, and exit_batch() does
not help the common case where a single netns is dismantled.

This patch leverages the existing synchronize_rcu() call
in cleanup_net()

Calling optional ->pre_exit() method before ->exit() or
->exit_batch() allows to benefit from a single synchronize_rcu()
call.

Note that the synchronize_rcu() calls added in this patch
are only in error paths or slow paths.

Tested:

$ time for i in {1..1000}; do unshare -n /bin/false;done
