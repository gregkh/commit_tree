fscrypt: simplify bounce page handling

Currently, bounce page handling for writes to encrypted files is
unnecessarily complicated.  A fscrypt_ctx is allocated along with each
bounce page, page_private(bounce_page) points to this fscrypt_ctx, and
fscrypt_ctx::w::control_page points to the original pagecache page.

However, because writes don't use the fscrypt_ctx for anything else,
there's no reason why page_private(bounce_page) can't just point to the
original pagecache page directly.

Therefore, this patch makes this change.  In the process, it also cleans
up the API exposed to filesystems that allows testing whether a page is
a bounce page, getting the pagecache page from a bounce page, and
freeing a bounce page.
