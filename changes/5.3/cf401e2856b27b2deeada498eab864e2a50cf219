drm/amdkfd: fix null pointer dereference on dev

The pointer dev is set to null yet it is being dereferenced when
checking dev->dqm->sched_policy.  Fix this by performing the check
on dev->dqm->sched_policy after dev has been assigned and null
checked.  Also remove the redundant null assignment to dev.
