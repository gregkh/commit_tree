net: hns3: process H/W errors occurred before HNS dev initialization

Presently the HNS driver enables the HNS H/W error interrupts after
the dev initialization is completed. However some exceptions such as
NCSI errors can occur when the network port driver is not loaded
and those errors required reporting to the BMC.
Therefore the firmware enabled all the HNS ras error interrupts
before the driver is loaded. And in some cases, there will be some
H/W errors remained unclear before reboot. Thus the HNS driver needs
to process and recover those hw errors occurred before HNS driver is
initialized.

This patch adds processing of the HNS hw errors(RAS and MSI-X)
which occurred before the driver initialization. For RAS, because
they are enabled by firmware, so we can detect specific bits, then
log and clear them. But for MSI-X which can not be enabled before
open vector0 irq, we can't detect the specific error bits, so we
just write 1 to all interrupt source registers to clear.
