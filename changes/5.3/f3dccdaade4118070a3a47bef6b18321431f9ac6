usb: pci-quirks: Correct AMD PLL quirk detection

The AMD PLL USB quirk is incorrectly enabled on newer Ryzen
chipsets. The logic in usb_amd_find_chipset_info currently checks
for unaffected chipsets rather than affected ones. This broke
once a new chipset was added in e788787ef. It makes more sense
to reverse the logic so it won't need to be updated as new
chipsets are added. Note that the core of the workaround in
usb_amd_quirk_pll does correctly check the chipset.
