i3c: Drop support for I2C 10 bit addresing

This patch drops support for I2C devices with 10 bit addressing. When I2C
device with 10 bit address is defined in DT, I3C master registration fails.

Address space for I2C devices has been reduced and ->i2c_funcs() hook has been
removed.

Because this patch series dropped support for 10 bit I2C devices, support is
also dropped in Cadence I3C master driver and Synopsys DesignWare I3C master
driver.
