ice: Add support for virtchnl_vector_map.[rxq|txq]_map

Add support for virtchnl_vector_map.[rxq|txq]_map to use bitmap to
associate indicated queues with the specified vector. This support is
needed since the Windows AVF driver calls VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_IRQ_MAP for
each vector and used the bitmap to indicate the associated queues.

Updated ice_vc_dis_qs_msg to not subtract one from
virtchnl_irq_map_info.num_vectors, and changed the VSI vector index to
the vector id. This change supports the Windows AVF driver which maps
one vector at a time and sets num_vectors to one. Using vectors_id to
index the vector array .

Add check for vector_id zero, and return VIRTCHNL_STATUS_ERR_PARAM
if vector_id is zero and there are rings associated with that vector.
Vector_id zero is for the OICR.
