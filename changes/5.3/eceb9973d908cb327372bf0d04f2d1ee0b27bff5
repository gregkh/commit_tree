KVM: nVMX: shadow pin based execution controls

The VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER flag may be toggled frequently, though not
*very* frequently.  Since it does not affect KVM's dirty logic, e.g.
the preemption timer value is loaded from vmcs12 even if vmcs12 is
"clean", there is no need to mark vmcs12 dirty when L1 writes pin
controls, and shadowing the field achieves that.
