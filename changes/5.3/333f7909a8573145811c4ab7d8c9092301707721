coallocate socket_wq with socket itself

socket->wq is assign-once, set when we are initializing both
struct socket it's in and struct socket_wq it points to.  As the
matter of fact, the only reason for separate allocation was the
ability to RCU-delay freeing of socket_wq.  RCU-delaying the
freeing of socket itself gets rid of that need, so we can just
fold struct socket_wq into the end of struct socket and simplify
the life both for sock_alloc_inode() (one allocation instead of
two) and for tun/tap oddballs, where we used to embed struct socket
and struct socket_wq into the same structure (now - embedding just
the struct socket).

Note that reference to struct socket_wq in struct sock does remain
a reference - that's unchanged.
