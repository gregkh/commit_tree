docs: kbuild: fix build with pdf and fix some minor issues

The tag ".. include" should be replaced by ".. literalinclude" at
issues.rst, otherwise it causes TeX to crash due to excessive usage
of stack with Sphinx 2.0.

While here, solve a few minor issues at the kbuild book output by
adding extra blank lines.
