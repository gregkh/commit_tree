ARM: dts: sun8i-h3: Fix wifi in Beelink X2 DT

mmc1 node where wifi module is connected doesn't have properly defined
power supplies so wifi module is never powered up. Fix that by
specifying additional power supplies.

Additionally, this STB may have either Realtek or Broadcom based wifi
module. One based on Broadcom module also needs external clock to work
properly. Fix that by adding clock property to wifi_pwrseq node.
