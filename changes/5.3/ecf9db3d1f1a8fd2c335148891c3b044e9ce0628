x86/vdso: Give the [ph]vclock_page declarations real types

Clean up the vDSO code a bit by giving pvclock_page and hvclock_page
their actual types instead of u8[PAGE_SIZE].  This shouldn't
materially affect the generated code.

Heavily based on a patch from Linus.

[ tglx: Adapted to the unified VDSO code ]
