iavf: add call to iavf_[add|del]_cloud_filter

Add call to iavf_add_cloud_filter and iavf_del_cloud_filter from
iavf_process_aq_command to clear aq_required
IAVF_FLAG_AQ_ADD_CLOUD_FILTER and IAVF_FLAG_AQ_DEL_CLOUD_FILTER bits.

aq_required IAVF_FLAG_AQ_DEL_CLOUD_FILTER bit is being set in
iavf_down and iavf_delete_clsflower, and are never cleared.

aq_required IAVF_FLAG_AQ_ADD_CLOUD_FILTER bit is being set in
iavf_handle_reset and iavf_configure_clsflower, and are never
cleared.

Since the aq_required is not zero, iavf_watchdog_task is setting the
queue_delayed_work to 20 msec instead of the longer delay.
