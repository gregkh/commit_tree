ice: Check all VFs for MDD activity, don't disable

Don't use the mdd_detected variable as an exit condition for this loop;
the first VF to NOT have an MDD event will cause the loop to terminate.

Instead just look at all of the VFs, but don't disable them. This
prevents proper release of resources if the VFs are rebooted or the VF
driver reloaded. Instead, just log a message and call out repeat
offenders.

To make it clear what we are doing, use a differently-named variable in
the loop.
