libbpf: add btf__parse_elf API to load .BTF and .BTF.ext

Loading BTF and BTF.ext from ELF file is a common need. Instead of
requiring every user to re-implement it, let's provide this API from
libbpf itself. It's mostly copy/paste from `bpftool btf dump`
implementation, which will be switched to libbpf's version in next
patch. btf__parse_elf allows to load BTF and optionally BTF.ext.
This is also useful for tests that need to load/work with BTF, loaded
from test ELF files.
