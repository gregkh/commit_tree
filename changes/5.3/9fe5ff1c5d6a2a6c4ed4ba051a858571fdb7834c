smb3: do not send compression info by default

Since in theory a server could respond with compressed read
responses even if not requested on read request (assuming that
a compression negcontext is sent in negotiate protocol) - do
not send compression information during negotiate protocol
unless the user asks for compression explicitly (compression
is experimental), and add a mount warning that compression
is experimental.
