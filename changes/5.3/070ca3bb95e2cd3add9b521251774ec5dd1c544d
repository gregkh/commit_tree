net: dsa: sja1105: Move sja1105_change_tpid into sja1105_vlan_filtering

This is a cosmetic patch, pre-cursor to making another change to the
General Parameters Table (incl_srcpt) which does not logically pertain
to the sja1105_change_tpid function name, but not putting it there would
otherwise create a need of resetting the switch twice.

So simply move the existing code into the .port_vlan_filtering callback,
where the incl_srcpt change will be added as well.
