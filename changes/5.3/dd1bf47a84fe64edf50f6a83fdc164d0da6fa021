net: bcmgenet: use ethtool_op_get_ts_info()

This change enables the use of SW timestamping on the Raspberry Pi 4.

bcmgenet's transmit function bcmgenet_xmit() implements software
timestamping. However the SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE capability was
missing and only SOF_TIMESTAMPING_RX_SOFTWARE was announced. By using
ethtool_ops bcmgenet_ethtool_ops() as get_ts_info(), the
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE capability is announced.
