docs: hid: convert to ReST

Rename the HID documentation files to ReST, add an
index for them and adjust in order to produce a nice html
output via the Sphinx build system.

While here, fix the sysfs example from hid-sensor.txt, that
has a lot of "?" instead of the proper UTF-8 characters that
are produced by the tree command.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
