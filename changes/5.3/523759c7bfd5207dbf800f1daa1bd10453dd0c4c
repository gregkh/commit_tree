media: staging/imx: Remove capture_device_set_format

Don't propagate the source pad format to the connected capture device.
It's now the responsibility of userspace to call VIDIOC_S_FMT on the
capture device to ensure the capture format and compose rectangle
are compatible with the connected source. To check this, validate
the capture format with the source before streaming starts.
