drm/amdkfd: Simplify eviction state logic

Always mark evicted queues with q->properties.is_evicted = true, even
queues that are inactive for other reason. This simplifies maintaining
the eviction state as it doesn't require updating is_evicted when other
queue activation conditions change.

On the other hand, we now need to check those other queue activation
conditions whenever an evicted queues is restored. To minimize code
duplication, move the queue activation check into a macro so it can be
maintained in one central place.
