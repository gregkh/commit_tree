virtio-net: lower min ring num_free for efficiency

This change lowers ring buffer reclaim threshold from 1/2*queue to budget
for better performance. According to our test with qemu + dpdk, packet
dropping happens when the guest is not able to provide free buffer in
avail ring timely with default 1/2*queue. The value in the patch has been
tested and does show better performance.

Test setup: iperf3 to generate packets to guest (total 30mins, pps 400k, UDP)
avg packets drop before: 2842
avg packets drop after: 360(-87.3%)

Further, current code suffers from a starvation problem: the amount of
work done by try_fill_recv is not bounded by the budget parameter, thus
(with large queues) once in a while userspace gets blocked for a long
time while queue is being refilled. Trigger refills earlier to make sure
the amount of work to do is limited.
