drm: Tweak drm_encoder_helper_funcs.enable kerneldoc

I copied the kerneldoc for encoder_funcs.atomic_enable from encoder_funcs.enable
in a recent patch [1]. Sam rightly pointed out in the review that "for symmetry
with" text is awkward [2]. So here's a patch to fix up the source of the awkward
language.
