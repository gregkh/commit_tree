ntp: Limit TAI-UTC offset

Don't allow the TAI-UTC offset of the system clock to be set by adjtimex()
to a value larger than 100000 seconds.

This prevents an overflow in the conversion to int, prevents the CLOCK_TAI
clock from getting too far ahead of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock, and it is
still large enough to allow leap seconds to be inserted at the maximum rate
currently supported by the kernel (once per day) for the next ~270 years,
however unlikely it is that someone can survive a catastrophic event which
slowed down the rotation of the Earth so much.
