bpf: Allow bpf_map_lookup_elem() on an xskmap

Currently, the AF_XDP code uses a separate map in order to
determine if an xsk is bound to a queue.  Instead of doing this,
have bpf_map_lookup_elem() return a xdp_sock.

Rearrange some xdp_sock members to eliminate structure holes.

Remove selftest - will be added back in later patch.
