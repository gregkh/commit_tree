chardev: set variable ret to -EBUSY before checking minor range overlap

When allocating dynamic major, the minor range overlap check
in __register_chrdev_region() will not fail, so actually
there is no real case to passing non negative error code to
caller. However, set variable ret to -EBUSY before checking
minor range overlap will avoid false-positive warning from
code analyzing tool(like Smatch) and also make the code more
easy to understand.
