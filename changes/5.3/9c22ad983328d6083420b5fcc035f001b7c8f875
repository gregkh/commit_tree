fbdev/sh_mob: Remove fb notifier callback

This seems to be entirely defunct:

- The FB_EVEN_SUSPEND/RESUME events are only sent out by
  fb_set_suspend. Which is supposed to be called by drivers in their
  suspend/resume hooks, and not itself call into drivers. Luckily
  sh_mob doesn't call fb_set_suspend, so this seems to do nothing
  useful.

- The notify hook calls sh_mobile_fb_reconfig() which in turn can
  call into the fb notifier. Or attempt too, since that would
  deadlock.

So looks like leftover hacks from when this was originally introduced
in

    fbdev: sh-mobile: HDMI support for SH-Mobile SoCs

So let's just remove it.
