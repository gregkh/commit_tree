libbpf: add bpf_object__load_xattr() API function to pass log_level

libbpf was recently made aware of the log_level attribute for programs,
used to specify the level of information expected to be dumped by the
verifier. Function bpf_prog_load_xattr() got support for this log_level
parameter.

But some applications using libbpf rely on another function to load
programs, bpf_object__load(), which does accept any parameter for log
level. Create an API function based on bpf_object__load(), but accepting
an "attr" object as a parameter. Then add a log_level field to that
object, so that applications calling the new bpf_object__load_xattr()
can pick the desired log level.

v3:
- Rewrite commit log.

v2:
- We are in a new cycle, bump libbpf extraversion number.
