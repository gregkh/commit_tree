drm/amdgpu: Use heavy weight for tlb invalidation on xgmi configuration

There is a bug found in vml2 xgmi logic:
mtype is always sent as NC on the VMC to TC interface for a page walk,
regardless of whether the request is being sent to local or remote GPU.
NC means non-coherent and will cause the VMC return data to be cached
in the TCC (versus UC â€“ uncached will not cache the data). Since the
page table updates are being done by SDMA/HDP, then TCC will never be
updated and the GC VML2 will continue to hit on the TCC and never get
the updated page tables and result in a fault.
Heave weigh tlb invalidation does a WB/INVAL of the L1/L2 GL data
caches so TCC will not be hit on next request
