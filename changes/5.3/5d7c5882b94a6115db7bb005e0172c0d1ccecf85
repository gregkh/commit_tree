ARM: dts: imx7s: Update coresight DT bindings

CoreSight DT bindings have been updated, thus the old compatible strings
are obsolete and the drivers will report warning if DTS uses these
obsolete strings.

This patch switches to the new bindings for CoreSight dynamic funnel and
static replicator, so can dismiss warning during initialisation.
