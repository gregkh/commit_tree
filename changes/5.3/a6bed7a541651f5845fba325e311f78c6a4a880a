NTB: Introduce NTB MSI Test Client

Introduce a tool to test NTB MSI interrupts similar to the other
NTB test tools. This tool creates a debugfs directory for each
NTB device with the following files:

port
irqX_occurrences
peerX/port
peerX/count
peerX/trigger

The 'port' file tells the user the local port number and the
'occurrences' files tell the number of local interrupts that
have been received for each interrupt.

For each peer, the 'port' file and the 'count' file tell you the
peer's port number and number of interrupts respectively. Writing
the interrupt number to the 'trigger' file triggers the interrupt
handler for the peer which should increment their corresponding
'occurrences' file. The 'ready' file indicates if a peer is ready,
writing to this file blocks until it is ready.

The module parameter num_irqs can be used to set the number of
local interrupts. By default this is 4. This is only limited by
the number of unused MSI interrupts registered by the hardware
(this will require support of the hardware driver) and there must
be at least 2*num_irqs + 1 spads registers available.
