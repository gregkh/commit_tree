Bluetooth: btrtl: HCI reset on close for Realtek BT chip

Realtek RTL8822BE BT chip on ASUS X420FA cannot be turned on correctly
after on-off several times. Bluetooth daemon sets BT mode failed when
this issue happens. Scanning must be active while turning off for this
bug to be hit.

bluetoothd[1576]: Failed to set mode: Failed (0x03)

If BT is turned off, then turned on again, it works correctly again.

According to the vendor driver, the HCI_QUIRK_RESET_ON_CLOSE flag is set
during probing. So, this patch makes Realtek's BT reset on close to fix
this issue.
