power: supply: cros: allow to set input voltage and current limit

This patch allows reading and writing the input voltage and current
limit through the POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_INPUT_VOLTAGE_LIMIT and
POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_INPUT_CURRENT_LIMIT sysfs properties. This allows
userspace to see current values and to re-configure these values at
runtime based on system-level knowledge or user input.

By default there is no limit, this is reported as a -1 when reading from
userspace. Writing a value will set the current or voltage limit in uA
or uV, and writing any negative value will remove that limit.
