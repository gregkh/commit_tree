KVM: nVMX: do not use dangling shadow VMCS after guest reset

If a KVM guest is reset while running a nested guest, free_nested will
disable the shadow VMCS execution control in the vmcs01.  However,
on the next KVM_RUN vmx_vcpu_run would nevertheless try to sync
the VMCS12 to the shadow VMCS which has since been freed.

This causes a vmptrld of a NULL pointer on my machime, but Jan reports
the host to hang altogether.  Let's see how much this trivial patch fixes.
