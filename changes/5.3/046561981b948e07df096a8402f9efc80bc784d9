libbpf: add "prog_flags" to bpf_program/bpf_prog_load_attr/bpf_load_program_attr

libbpf doesn't allow passing "prog_flags" during bpf program load in a
couple of load related APIs, "bpf_load_program_xattr", "load_program" and
"bpf_prog_load_xattr".

It makes sense to allow passing "prog_flags" which is useful for
customizing program loading.
