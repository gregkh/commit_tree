crypto: arm64/aes-ce - add 5 way interleave routines

In preparation of tweaking the accelerated AES chaining mode routines
to be able to use a 5-way stride, implement the core routines to
support processing 5 blocks of input at a time. While at it, drop
the 2 way versions, which have been unused for a while now.
