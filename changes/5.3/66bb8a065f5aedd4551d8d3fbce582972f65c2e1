KVM: x86: PMU Event Filter

Some events can provide a guest with information about other guests or the
host (e.g. L3 cache stats); providing the capability to restrict access
to a "safe" set of events would limit the potential for the PMU to be used
in any side channel attacks. This change introduces a new VM ioctl that
sets an event filter. If the guest attempts to program a counter for
any blacklisted or non-whitelisted event, the kernel counter won't be
created, so any RDPMC/RDMSR will show 0 instances of that event.
