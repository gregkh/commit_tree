RDMA/efa: Use kvzalloc instead of kzalloc with fallback

Use kvzalloc which attempts to allocate a physically continuous buffer and
fallbacks to virtually continuous on failure instead of open coding it in
the driver.

The is_vmalloc_addr function is used to determine whether the buffer is
physically continuous or not (which determines direct vs indirect MR
registration mode).
