net: phy: dp83867: Add ability to disable output clock

Generally, the output clock pin is only used for testing and only serves
as a source of RF noise after this.  It could be used to daisy-chain
PHYs, but this is uncommon.  Since the PHY can disable the output, make
doing so an option.  I do this by adding another enumeration to the
allowed values of ti,clk-output-sel.

The code was not using the value DP83867_CLK_O_SEL_REF_CLK as one might
expect: to select the REF_CLK as the output.  Rather it meant "keep
clock output setting as is", which, depending on PHY strapping, might
not be outputting REF_CLK.

Change this so DP83867_CLK_O_SEL_REF_CLK means enable REF_CLK output.
Omitting the property will leave the setting as is (which was the
previous behavior in this case).

Out of range values were silently converted into
DP83867_CLK_O_SEL_REF_CLK.  Change this so they generate an error.
