pidfd: add polling support

This patch adds polling support to pidfd.

Android low memory killer (LMK) needs to know when a process dies once
it is sent the kill signal. It does so by checking for the existence of
/proc/pid which is both racy and slow. For example, if a PID is reused
between when LMK sends a kill signal and checks for existence of the
PID, since the wrong PID is now possibly checked for existence.
Using the polling support, LMK will be able to get notified when a process
exists in race-free and fast way, and allows the LMK to do other things
(such as by polling on other fds) while awaiting the process being killed
to die.

For notification to polling processes, we follow the same existing
mechanism in the kernel used when the parent of the task group is to be
notified of a child's death (do_notify_parent). This is precisely when the
tasks waiting on a poll of pidfd are also awakened in this patch.

We have decided to include the waitqueue in struct pid for the following
reasons:
1. The wait queue has to survive for the lifetime of the poll. Including
   it in task_struct would not be option in this case because the task can
   be reaped and destroyed before the poll returns.

2. By including the struct pid for the waitqueue means that during
   de_thread(), the new thread group leader automatically gets the new
   waitqueue/pid even though its task_struct is different.

Appropriate test cases are added in the second patch to provide coverage of
all the cases the patch is handling.
