libnvdimm/pfn: fix fsdax-mode namespace info-block zero-fields

At namespace creation time there is the potential for the "expected to
be zero" fields of a 'pfn' info-block to be filled with indeterminate
data.  While the kernel buffer is zeroed on allocation it is immediately
overwritten by nd_pfn_validate() filling it with the current contents of
the on-media info-block location.  For fields like, 'flags' and the
'padding' it potentially means that future implementations can not rely on
those fields being zero.

In preparation to stop using the 'start_pad' and 'end_trunc' fields for
section alignment, arrange for fields that are not explicitly
initialized to be guaranteed zero.  Bump the minor version to indicate
it is safe to assume the 'padding' and 'flags' are zero.  Otherwise,
this corruption is expected to benign since all other critical fields
are explicitly initialized.

Note The cc: stable is about spreading this new policy to as many
kernels as possible not fixing an issue in those kernels.  It is not
until the change titled "libnvdimm/pfn: Stop padding pmem namespaces to
section alignment" where this improper initialization becomes a problem.
So if someone decides to backport "libnvdimm/pfn: Stop padding pmem
namespaces to section alignment" (which is not tagged for stable), make
sure this pre-requisite is flagged.
