Revert "powerpc: slightly improve cache helpers"

This reverts commit 6c5875843b87c3adea2beade9d1b8b3d4523900a.

It triggers a probable compiler bug on clang which leads to crashes.

With GCC it allows the compiler to use a more efficient register
allocation but current GCC versions never do that at any of the current
call sites, so there's no benefit.
