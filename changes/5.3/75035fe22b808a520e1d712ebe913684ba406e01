habanalabs: fix F/W download in BE architecture

writeX macros might perform byte-swapping in BE architectures. As our F/W
is in LE format, we need to make sure no byte-swapping will occur.

There is a standard kernel function (called memcpy_toio) for copying data
to I/O area which is used in a lot of drivers to download F/W to PCIe
adapters. That function also makes sure the data is copied "as-is",
without byte-swapping.

This patch use that function to copy the F/W to the GOYA ASIC instead of
writeX macros.
