qtnfmac: Use struct_size() in kzalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct ieee80211_regdomain {
	...
        struct ieee80211_reg_rule reg_rules[];
};

instance = kzalloc(sizeof(*mac->rd) +
                          sizeof(struct ieee80211_reg_rule) *
                          count, GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = kzalloc(struct_size(instance, reg_rules, count), GFP_KERNEL);

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
