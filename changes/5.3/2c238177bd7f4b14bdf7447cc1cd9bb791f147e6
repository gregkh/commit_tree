bpf: allow narrow loads of some sk_reuseport_md fields with offset > 0

test_select_reuseport fails on s390 due to verifier rejecting
test_select_reuseport_kern.o with the following message:

	; data_check.eth_protocol = reuse_md->eth_protocol;
	18: (69) r1 = *(u16 *)(r6 +22)
	invalid bpf_context access off=22 size=2

This is because on big-endian machines casts from __u32 to __u16 are
generated by referencing the respective variable as __u16 with an offset
of 2 (as opposed to 0 on little-endian machines).

The verifier already has all the infrastructure in place to allow such
accesses, it's just that they are not explicitly enabled for
eth_protocol field. Enable them for eth_protocol field by using
bpf_ctx_range instead of offsetof.

Ditto for ip_protocol, bind_inany and len, since they already allow
narrowing, and the same problem can arise when working with them.
