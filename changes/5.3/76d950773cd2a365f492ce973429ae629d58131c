selftests/bpf: add verifier tests for wide stores

Make sure that wide stores are allowed at proper (aligned) addresses.
Note that user_ip6 is naturally aligned on 8-byte boundary, so
correct addresses are user_ip6[0] and user_ip6[2]. msg_src_ip6 is,
however, aligned on a 4-byte bondary, so only msg_src_ip6[1]
can be wide-stored.
