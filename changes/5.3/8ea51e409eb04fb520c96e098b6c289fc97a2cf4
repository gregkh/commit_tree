ath10k: htt: support MSDU ids with SDIO

Transmit completion for SDIO is similar to PCIe, modify the high
latency path to allow SDIO modules to use the msdu id.

kvalo: the original patch from Alagu enabled this only for SDIO but I'm not
sure should we also enable this with USB. I'll use bus params to enable this
for so that it's easy to enable also for USB later.

Tested with QCA6174 SDIO with firmware WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00007-QCARMSWP-1.
