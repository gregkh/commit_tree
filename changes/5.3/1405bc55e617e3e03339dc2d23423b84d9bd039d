media: coda: Replace the threaded interrupt with a hard interrupt

The current interrupt handler is doing very little, and not doing
any non-atomic operations. Pretty much all it does is accessing
a couple registers, taking a couple spinlocks and then signalling
a completion.

There is no reason this should be a threaded interrupt handler,
so move the handler to regular hard interrupt context.
