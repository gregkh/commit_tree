lockdep: Add assertion to check if in an interrupt

In rcu_rrupt_from_idle, we want to check if it is called from within an
interrupt, but want to do such checking only for debug builds. lockdep
already tracks when we enter an interrupt. Let us expose it as an
assertion macro so it can be used to assert this.
