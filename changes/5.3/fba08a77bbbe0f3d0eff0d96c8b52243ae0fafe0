drm/amdgpu/psp: perform tmr_init and asd_init after loading sysdrv/sos

Since from navi10, the tmr_size should be decided by psp sos according to
toc header. Driver should issue LOAD_TOC to psp sos to get the tmr_size needed.
The allocation of tmr_size then should be done only when sos/sysdrv loading
completed

Accordingly, asd_init also move to psp_hw_start after sos fw loading to make
calling sequence consistent.
