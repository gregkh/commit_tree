Revert "Bluetooth: btusb: driver to enable the usb-wakeup feature"

This reverts commit a0085f2510e8976614ad8f766b209448b385492f.

This commit has caused regressions in notebooks that support suspend
to idle such as the XPS 9360, XPS 9370 and XPS 9380.

These notebooks will wakeup from suspend to idle from an unsolicited
advertising packet from an unpaired BLE device.

In a bug report it was sugggested that this is caused by a generic
lack of LE privacy support.  Revert this commit until that behavior
can be avoided by the kernel.
