qed: Modify offload protocols to use the affined engine

To enable 100g support for offload protocols each PF gets
a dedicated engine to work on from the MFW.
This patch modifies the code to use the affined hwfn instead
of the leading one.
The offload protocols require the ll2 to be opened on both
engines, and not just the affined hwfn.
