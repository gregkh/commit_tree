media: videobuf2-core: Prevent size alignment wrapping buffer size to 0

PAGE_ALIGN() may wrap the buffer size around to 0. Prevent this by
checking that the aligned value is not smaller than the unaligned one.

Note on backporting to stable: the file used to be under
drivers/media/v4l2-core, it was moved to the current location after 4.14.
