iio: adc: gyroadc: fix uninitialized return code

gcc-9 complains about a blatant uninitialized variable use that
all earlier compiler versions missed:

drivers/iio/adc/rcar-gyroadc.c:510:5: warning: 'ret' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

Return -EINVAL instead here and a few lines above it where
we accidentally return 0 on failure.
