usb: renesas_usbhs: Use renesas_usbhs_platform_info on of_device_id.data

In device tree environment, the previous code allocates
renesas_usbhs_platform_info by using devm_kzalloc() and then copies
usbhs_of_data to the allocated memory. This reason is some values
(e.g. .platform_callback.get_vbus) are overwritten by the driver,
but the of_device_id.data is "const". Now the driver doesn't have
such a code, so this patch uses renesas_usbhs_platform_info on
of_device_id.data.

Note that the previous code set the pdev->dev.platform_data pointer
even if device tree environment, but the value is not used. So,
this patch also remove such a code.
