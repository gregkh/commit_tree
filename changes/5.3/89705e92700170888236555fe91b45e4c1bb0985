IB/mlx5: Report correctly tag matching rendezvous capability

Userspace expects the IB_TM_CAP_RC bit to indicate that the device
supports RC transport tag matching with rendezvous offload. However the
firmware splits this into two capabilities for eager and rendezvous tag
matching.

Only if the FW supports both modes should userspace be told the tag
matching capability is available.
