powerpc/cacheinfo: add cacheinfo_teardown, cacheinfo_rebuild

Allow external callers to force the cacheinfo code to release all its
references to cache nodes, e.g. before processing device tree updates
post-migration, and to rebuild the hierarchy afterward.

CPU online/offline must be blocked by callers; enforce this.
