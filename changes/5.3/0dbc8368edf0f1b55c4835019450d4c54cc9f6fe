drivers/staging/rtl8192u: style nonstyled comments

The coding-styles.rst states, that multiline comments should
allways contain a leading "*" in each line.
For multiline comments in general they

/*
 * should look
 * like this.
 */

For multiline comments in either net/ or drivers/net/ however,
they should

/* omit
 * the first
 * empty line.
 */

Since this file is part of a networking driver, the goal for it would
be to reside in drivers/net/ one day.

This patch changes comments, that were in neither form of the two listed
above, to have the style that is specified for drivers/net/.
