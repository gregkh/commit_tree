perf tools: Fix cache.h include directive

Change the include path so that progress.c can find cache.h since it was
previously searching in the wrong directory.

Committer notes:

  $ ls -la tools/perf/ui/../cache.h
  ls: cannot access 'tools/perf/ui/../cache.h': No such file or directory

So it really should include ../../util/cache.h, or plain cache.h, since
we have -Iutil in INC_FLAGS in tools/perf/Makefile.config
