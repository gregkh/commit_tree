drm/edid: Fix a missing-check bug in drm_load_edid_firmware()

In drm_load_edid_firmware(), fwstr is allocated by kstrdup(). And fwstr
is dereferenced in the following codes. However, memory allocation
functions such as kstrdup() may fail and returns NULL. Dereferencing
this null pointer may cause the kernel go wrong. Thus we should check
this kstrdup() operation.
Further, if kstrdup() returns NULL, we should return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM) to
the caller site.
