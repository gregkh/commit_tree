raid5-cache: Need to do start() part job after adding journal device

commit d5d885fd514f ("md: introduce new personality funciton start()")
splits the init job to two parts. The first part run() does the jobs that
do not require the md threads. The second part start() does the jobs that
require the md threads.

Now it just does run() in adding new journal device. It needs to do the
second part start() too.
