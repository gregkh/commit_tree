media: Revert "media: staging/imx: Allow driver to build if COMPILE_TEST is enabled"

Commit 020bc7354a6e ("media: staging/imx: Allow driver to build
if COMPILE_TEST is enabled") incorrectly assumed that the imx media
driver had no build time dependency with IMX_IPUV3_CORE.

Building on x86_64 without IMX_IPUV3_CORE causes lots of build errors
such as:

All these definitions come from the imx ipu3 core driver, so make
sure that imx media depends on IMX_IPUV3_CORE.

This reverts commit 020bc7354a6ebec980e0aedf5bedf57b42f93aca.
