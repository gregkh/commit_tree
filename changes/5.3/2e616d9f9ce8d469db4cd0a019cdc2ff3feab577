xfs: fix stack contents leakage in the v1 inumber ioctls

Explicitly initialize the onstack structures to zero so we don't leak
kernel memory into userspace when converting the in-core inumbers
structure to the v1 inogrp ioctl structure.  Add a comment about why we
have to use memset to ensure that the padding holes in the structures
are set to zero.
