x86/hpet: Rename variables to prepare for switching to channels

struct hpet_dev is gone with the next change as the clockevent storage
moves into struct hpet_channel. So the variable name hdev will not make
sense anymore. Ditto for timer vs. channel and similar details.

Doing the rename in the change makes the patch harder to review. Doing it
afterward is problematic vs. tracking down issues.  Doing it upfront is the
easiest solution as it does not change functionality.
