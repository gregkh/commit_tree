nvme-trace: print result and status in hex format

The "result" field is in 64bit to be printed out which means it could be
like:
  nvme_complete_rq: nvme0: qid=0, cmdid=0, res=18446612684158962624, etries=0, flags=0x0, status=0

Switch both the result and status field to be printed in hexadecimal
format to be easier to read.
