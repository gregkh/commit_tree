dmaengine: Revert "dmaengine: fsl-edma: support little endian for edma driver"

This reverts commit 002905eca5bedab08bafd9e325bbbb41670c7712.

Commit 002905eca5be ("dmaengine: fsl-edma: support little endian for edma
driver") incorrectly assumed that there was not little endian support
in the driver.

This causes hangs on Vybrid, so revert it so that Vybrid systems
could boot again.
