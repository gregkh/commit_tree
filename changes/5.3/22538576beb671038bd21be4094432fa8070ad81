arm64: dts: allwinner: h6: add PIO VCC bank supplies for Pine H64

The Allwinner H6 SoC features tweakable VCC for PC, PD, PG, PL and PM
banks.

This patch adds supplies for these banks except PL bank. PL bank is
where PMIC is attached, and currently if a PMIC regulator is added
for it a dependency loop will happen.
