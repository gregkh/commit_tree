fs/select.c: use struct_size() in kmalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array.  For example:

  struct foo {
       int stuff;
       struct boo entry[];
  };

  size = sizeof(struct foo) + count * sizeof(struct boo);
  instance = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can now
use the new struct_size() helper:

  instance = kmalloc(struct_size(instance, entry, count), GFP_KERNEL);

Also, notice that variable size is unnecessary, hence it is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
