x86/entry/32: Pass cr2 to do_async_page_fault()

Commit a0d14b8909de ("x86/mm, tracing: Fix CR2 corruption") added the
address parameter to do_async_page_fault(), but does not pass it from the
32-bit entry point.  To plumb it through, factor-out
common_exception_read_cr2 in the same fashion as common_exception, and uses
it from both page_fault and async_page_fault.

For a 32-bit KVM guest, this fixes:

  Run /sbin/init as init process
  Starting init: /sbin/init exists but couldn't execute it (error -14)
