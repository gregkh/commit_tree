cpufreq: Register notifiers with the PM QoS framework

Register notifiers for min/max frequency constraints with the PM QoS
framework. The constraints are also taken into consideration in
cpufreq_set_policy().

This also relocates cpufreq_policy_put_kobj() as it is required to be
called from cpufreq_policy_alloc() now.

refresh_frequency_limits() is updated to avoid calling
cpufreq_set_policy() for inactive policies and handle_update() is
updated to have proper locking in place.

No constraints are added until now though.
