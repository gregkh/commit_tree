ipv4: fix inet_select_addr() when enable route_localnet

Suppose we have two interfaces eth0 and eth1 in two hosts, follow
the same steps in the two hosts:
 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.eth1.route_localnet=1
 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.eth1.arp_announce=2
 # ip route del 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo table local
and then set ip to eth1 in host1 like:
 # ifconfig eth1 127.25.3.4/24
set ip to eth2 in host2 and ping host1:
 # ifconfig eth1 127.25.3.14/24
 # ping -I eth1 127.25.3.4
Well, host2 cannot connect to host1.

When set a ip address with head 127, the scope of the address defaults
to RT_SCOPE_HOST. In this situation, host2 will use arp_solicit() to
send a arp request for the mac address of host1 with ip
address 127.25.3.14. When arp_announce=2, inet_select_addr() cannot
select a correct saddr with condition ifa->ifa_scope > scope, because
ifa_scope is RT_SCOPE_HOST and scope is RT_SCOPE_LINK. Then,
inet_select_addr() will go to no_in_dev to lookup all interfaces to find
a primary ip and finally get the primary ip of eth0.

Here I add a localnet_scope defaults to RT_SCOPE_HOST, and when
route_localnet is enabled, this value changes to RT_SCOPE_LINK to make
inet_select_addr() find a correct primary ip as saddr of arp request.
