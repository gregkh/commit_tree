drm/i915: Move state dump to the end of atomic_check()

Currently we're dumping the crtc states before they have
been fully calculated. Move the dumping to the end of
.atomic_check() so we get a fully up to date dump.

Let's also do the dump for fully disabled pipes, but we'll
limit that to just saying that the pipe is disabled since
the rest of the state is going to be nonsense in that case.
