net/mlx5: Report devlink health on FW fatal issues

Report devlink health on FW fatal issues via fw_fatal_reporter. The
driver recover flow for FW fatal error is now being handled by the
devlink health.

Having the recovery controlled by devlink health, the user has the
ability to cancel the auto-recovery for debug session and run it
manually.

Call mlx5_enter_error_state() before calling devlink_health_report() to
ensure entering device error state even if auto-recovery is off.
