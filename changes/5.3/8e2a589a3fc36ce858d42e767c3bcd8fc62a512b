staging: comedi: dt3000: Fix rounding up of timer divisor

`dt3k_ns_to_timer()` determines the prescaler and divisor to use to
produce a desired timing period.  It is influenced by a rounding mode
and can round the divisor up, down, or to the nearest value.  However,
the code for rounding up currently does the same as rounding down!  Fix
ir by using the `DIV_ROUND_UP()` macro to calculate the divisor when
rounding up.

Also, change the types of the `divider`, `base` and `prescale` variables
from `int` to `unsigned int` to avoid mixing signed and unsigned types
in the calculations.

Also fix a typo in a nearby comment: "improvment" => "improvement".
