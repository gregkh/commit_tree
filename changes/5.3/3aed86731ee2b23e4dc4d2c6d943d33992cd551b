nvmet: Fix use-after-free bug when a port is removed

When a port is removed through configfs, any connected controllers
are still active and can still send commands. This causes a
use-after-free bug which is detected by KASAN for any admin command
that dereferences req->port (like in nvmet_execute_identify_ctrl).

To fix this, disconnect all active controllers when a subsystem is
removed from a port. This ensures there are no active controllers
when the port is eventually removed.
