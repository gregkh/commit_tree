sched/fair: Clean up definition of NOHZ blocked load functions

cfs_rq_has_blocked() and others_have_blocked() are only used within
update_blocked_averages(). The !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED version of the
latter calls them within a #define CONFIG_NO_HZ_COMMON block, whereas
the CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED one calls them unconditionnally.

As reported by Qian, the above leads to this warning in
!CONFIG_NO_HZ_COMMON configs:

  kernel/sched/fair.c: In function 'update_blocked_averages':
  kernel/sched/fair.c:7750:7: warning: variable 'done' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

It wouldn't be wrong to keep cfs_rq_has_blocked() and
others_have_blocked() as they are, but since their only current use is
to figure out when we can stop calling update_blocked_averages() on
fully decayed NOHZ idle CPUs, we can give them a new definition for
!CONFIG_NO_HZ_COMMON.

Change the definition of cfs_rq_has_blocked() and
others_have_blocked() for !CONFIG_NO_HZ_COMMON so that the
NOHZ-specific blocks of update_blocked_averages() become no-ops and
the 'done' variable gets optimised out.

While at it, remove the CONFIG_NO_HZ_COMMON block from the
!CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED definition of update_blocked_averages() by
using the newly-introduced update_blocked_load_status() helper.

No change in functionality intended.
