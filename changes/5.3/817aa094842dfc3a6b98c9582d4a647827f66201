ubifs: support offline signed images

HMACs can only be generated on the system the UBIFS image is running on.
To support offline signed images we add a PKCS#7 signature to the UBIFS
image which can be created by mkfs.ubifs.

Both the master node and the superblock need to be authenticated, during
normal runtime both are protected with HMACs. For offline signature
support however only a single signature is desired. We add a signature
covering the superblock node directly behind it. To protect the master
node a hash of the master node is added to the superblock which is used
when the master node doesn't contain a HMAC.

Transition to a read/write filesystem is also supported. During
transition first the master node is rewritten with a HMAC (implicitly,
it is written anyway as the FS is marked dirty). Afterwards the
superblock is rewritten with a HMAC. Once after the image has been
mounted read/write it is HMAC only, the signature is no longer required
or even present on the filesystem.

In an offline signed image the master node is authenticated by the
superblock. In a transition to r/w we have to make sure that the master
node is rewritten before the superblock node. In this case the master
node gets a HMAC and its authenticity no longer depends on the
superblock node. There are some cases in which the current code first
writes the superblock node though, so with this patch writing of the
superblock node is delayed until the master node is written.
