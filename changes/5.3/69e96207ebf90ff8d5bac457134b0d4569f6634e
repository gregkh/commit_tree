s390/qdio: restrict QAOB usage to IQD unicast queues

The IQD mcast queue doesn't support QAOB mode, so skip the
qdio_enable_async_operation() setup call for this queue. This avoids
the allocation of an unneeded QAOB pointer array, and sets up q->use_cq
properly so that drivers are prohibited from using QAOBs for mcast
traffic.

Take this opportunity to streamline the q->use_cq and aob != 0 checks.
The path to qdio_siga_output() is straight-forward, we don't need to
worry about being called with bad operands.
