scsi: bnx2fc: Redo setting source FCoE MAC

For bnx2fc, the source FCoE MAC is stored in the fcoe_port struct in the
data_src_mac field.  Currently this is set in fcoe_ctlr_recv_flogi which
ends up setting it by simply using fc_fcoe_set_mac() which only uses the
default FCF-MAC.  We still want to store the source FCoE MAC in
port->data_src_mac but we want to snoop the FLOGI response payload so as to
set it in the following method:

1. If a granted_mac is found, use that.

2. If not granted_mac is there but there is a FCF-MAP from the FCF then
   create the MAC from the FCF-MAP and the destination ID from the frame.

3. If there is no FCF-MAP the use the spec. default FCF-MAP and the
   destination ID from the frame.
