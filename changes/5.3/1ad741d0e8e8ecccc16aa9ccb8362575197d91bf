ASoC: topology: fix memory leaks on sm, se and sbe

Currently when a kstrdup fails the error exit paths don't free
the allocations for sm, se and sbe.  This can be fixed by assigning
kc[i].private_value to these before doing the ksrtdup so that the error
exit path will be able to free these objects.
