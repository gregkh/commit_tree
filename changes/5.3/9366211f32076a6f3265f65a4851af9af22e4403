selftests: ptp: Add Physical Hardware Clock test

Test the PTP Physical Hardware Clock functionality using the "phc_ctl" (a
part of "linuxptp").

The test contains three sub-tests:
  * "settime" test
  * "adjtime" test
  * "adjfreq" test

"settime" test:
  * set the PHC time to 0 seconds.
  * wait for 120.5 seconds.
  * check if PHC time equal to 120.XX seconds.

"adjtime" test:
  * set the PHC time to 0 seconds.
  * adjust the time by 10 seconds.
  * check if PHC time equal to 10.XX seconds.

"adjfreq" test:
  * adjust the PHC frequency to be 1% faster.
  * set the PHC time to 0 seconds.
  * wait for 100.5 seconds.
  * check if PHC time equal to 101.XX seconds.

Usage:
  $ ./phc.sh /dev/ptp<X>

  It is possible to run a subset of the tests, for example:
    * To run only the "settime" test:
      $ TESTS="settime" ./phc.sh /dev/ptp<X>
