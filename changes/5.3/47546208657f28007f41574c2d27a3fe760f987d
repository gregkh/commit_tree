keys: Reuse keyring_index_key::desc_len in lookup_user_key()

When lookup_user_key() checks whether the key is possessed, it should
use the key's existing index_key including the 'desc_len' field, rather
than recomputing the 'desc_len'.  This doesn't change the behavior; this
way is just simpler and faster.
