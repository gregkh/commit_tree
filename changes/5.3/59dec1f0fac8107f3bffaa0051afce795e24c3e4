regulator: max77650: Move max77651_SBB1_desc's declaration down

Clang warns:

drivers/regulator/max77650-regulator.c:32:39: warning: tentative
definition of variable with internal linkage has incomplete non-array
type 'struct max77650_regulator_desc'
[-Wtentative-definition-incomplete-type]
static struct max77650_regulator_desc max77651_SBB1_desc;
                                      ^
drivers/regulator/max77650-regulator.c:32:15: note: forward declaration

static struct max77650_regulator_desc max77651_SBB1_desc;
              ^
1 warning generated.

Move max77651_SBB1_desc's declaration below max77650_regulator_desc's
definition so this warning does not happen.
