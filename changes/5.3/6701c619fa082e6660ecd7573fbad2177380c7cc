KVM: arm64: Update kvm_arm_exception_class and esr_class_str for new EC

We've added two ESR exception classes for new ARM hardware extensions:
ESR_ELx_EC_PAC and ESR_ELx_EC_SVE, but failed to update the strings
used in tracing and other debug.

Let's update "kvm_arm_exception_class" for these two EC, which the
new EC will be visible to user-space via kvm_exit trace events
Also update to "esr_class_str" for ESR_ELx_EC_PAC, by which we can
get more readable debug info.
