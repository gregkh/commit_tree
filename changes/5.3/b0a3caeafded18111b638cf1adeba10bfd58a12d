MAINTAINERS: add myself as maintainer for xilinx axiethernet driver

I am maintaining xilinx axiethernet driver in xilinx tree and would like
to maintain it in the mainline kernel as well. Hence adding myself as a
maintainer. Also Anirudha and John has moved to new roles, so based on
request removing them from the maintainer list.
