get_maintainer: add ability to skip moderated mailing lists

Add a command line switch --no-moderated to skip L: mailing lists marked
with 'moderated'.

Some people prefer not emailing moderated mailing lists as the
moderation time can be indeterminate and some emails can be
intentionally dropped by a moderator.

This can cause fragmentation of email threads when some are subscribed
to a moderated list but others are not and emails are dropped.
