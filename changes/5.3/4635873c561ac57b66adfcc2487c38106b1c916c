scsi: lib/sg_pool.c: improve APIs for allocating sg pool

sg_alloc_table_chained() currently allows the caller to provide one
preallocated SGL and returns if the requested number isn't bigger than
size of that SGL. This is used to inline an SGL for an IO request.

However, scattergather code only allows that size of the 1st preallocated
SGL to be SG_CHUNK_SIZE(128). This means a substantial amount of memory
(4KB) is claimed for the SGL for each IO request. If the I/O is small, it
would be prudent to allocate a smaller SGL.

Introduce an extra parameter to sg_alloc_table_chained() and
sg_free_table_chained() for specifying size of the preallocated SGL.

Both __sg_free_table() and __sg_alloc_table() assume that each SGL has the
same size except for the last one.  Change the code to allow both functions
to accept a variable size for the 1st preallocated SGL.
