PCI/MSI: Support allocating virtual MSI interrupts

For NTB devices, we want to be able to trigger MSI interrupts
through a memory window. In these cases we may want to use
more interrupts than the NTB PCI device has available in its MSI-X
table.

We allow for this by creating a new 'virtual' interrupt. These
interrupts are allocated as usual but are not programmed into the
MSI-X table (as there may not be space for them).

The MSI address and data will then handled through an NTB MSI library
introduced later in this series.
