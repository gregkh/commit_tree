media: aspeed: refine interrupt handling logic

There are cases that interrupt bits are cleared by a 500ms delayed
work which causes unnecessary irq calls. Also, the current
interrupt handler returns IRQ_HANDLED always but it should return
IRQ_NONE if there is any unhandled interrupt. So this commit
refines the interrupt handling logic to fix these issues.
