net/mlx5e: Allow ICO SQ to be used by multiple RQs

Prepare to creation of the XSK RQ, which will require posting UMRs, too.
The same ICO SQ will be used for both RQs and also to trigger interrupts
by posting NOPs. UMR WQEs can't be reused any more. Optimization
introduced in commit ab966d7e4ff98 ("net/mlx5e: RX, Recycle buffer of
UMR WQEs") is reverted.
