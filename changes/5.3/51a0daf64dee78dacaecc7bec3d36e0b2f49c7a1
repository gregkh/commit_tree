ARM: mach-shmobile: Don't init CNTVOFF/counter if PSCI is available

If PSCI is available then most likely we are running on PSCI-enabled
U-Boot which, we assume, has already taken care of resetting CNTVOFF
and updating counter module before switching to non-secure mode
and we don't need to.

As the psci_smp_available() helper always returns false if CONFIG_SMP
is disabled, it can't be used safely as an indicator of PSCI usage.
For that reason, we check for the mandatory PSCI operation to be
available.

Please note, an extra check to prevent secure_cntvoff_init() from
being called for secondary CPUs in headsmp-apmu.S is not needed,
as SMP code for APMU based system is not executed if PSCI is in use.
