ipv6: tcp: send consistent flowlabel in TIME_WAIT state

After commit 1d13a96c74fc ("ipv6: tcp: fix flowlabel value in ACK
messages"), we stored in tw_flowlabel the flowlabel, in the
case ACK packets needed to be sent on behalf of a TIME_WAIT socket.

We can use the same field so that RST packets sent from
TIME_WAIT state also use a consistent flowlabel.
