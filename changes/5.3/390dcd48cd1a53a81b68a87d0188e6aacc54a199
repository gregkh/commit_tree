batman-adv: mcast: avoid redundant multicast TT entries with bridges

When a bridge is added on top of bat0 we set the WANT_ALL_UNSNOOPABLES
flag. Which means we sign up for all traffic for ff02::1/128 and
224.0.0.0/24.

When the node itself had IPv6 enabled or joined a group in 224.0.0.0/24
itself then so far this would result in a multicast TT entry which is
redundant to the WANT_ALL_UNSNOOPABLES.

With this patch such redundant TT entries are avoided.
