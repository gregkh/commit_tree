ARM: dts: rockchip: Add pin names for rk3288-veyron jaq, mickey, speedy

This is like commit 0ca87bd5baa6 ("ARM: dts: rockchip: Add pin names
for rk3288-veyron-jerry") and commit ca3516b32cd9 ("ARM: dts:
rockchip: Add pin names for rk3288-veyron-minnie") but for 3 more
veyron boards.

A few notes:
- While there is most certainly duplication between all the veyron
  boards, it still feels like it is sane to just have each board have
  a full list of its pin names.  The format of "gpio-line-names" does
  not lend itself to one-off overriding and besides it seems sane to
  more fully match schematic names.  Also note that the extra
  duplication here is only in source code and is unlikely to ever
  change (since these boards are shipped).  Duplication in the .dtb
  files is unavoidable.
- veyron-jaq and veyron-mighty are very closely related and so I have
  shared a single list for them both with comments on how they are
  different.  This is just a typo fix on one of the boards, a possible
  missing signal on one of the boards (or perhaps I was never given
  the most recent schematics?) and dealing with the fact that one of
  the two boards has full sized SD.
