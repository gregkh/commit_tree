ath10k: add peer id check in ath10k_peer_find_by_id

For some SDIO chip, the peer id is 65535 for MPDU with error status,
then test_bit will trigger buffer overflow for peer's memory, if kasan
enabled, it will report error.

Reason is when station is in disconnecting status, firmware do not delete
the peer info since it not disconnected completely, meanwhile some AP will
still send data packet to station, then hardware will receive the packet
and send to firmware, firmware's logic will report peer id of 65535 for
MPDU with error status.

Add check for overflow the size of peer's peer_ids will avoid the buffer
overflow access.
