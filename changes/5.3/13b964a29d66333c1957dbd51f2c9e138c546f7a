KVM: nVMX: Don't "put" vCPU or host state when switching VMCS

When switching between vmcs01 and vmcs02, KVM isn't actually switching
between guest and host.  If guest state is already loaded (the likely,
if not guaranteed, case), keep the guest state loaded and manually swap
the loaded_cpu_state pointer after propagating saved host state to the
new vmcs0{1,2}.

Avoiding the switch between guest and host reduces the latency of
switching between vmcs01 and vmcs02 by several hundred cycles, and
reduces the roundtrip time of a nested VM by upwards of 1000 cycles.
