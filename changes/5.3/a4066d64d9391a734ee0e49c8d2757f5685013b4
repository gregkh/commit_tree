perf trace: Fix exclusion of not available syscall names from selector list

We were just skipping the syscalls not available in a particular
architecture without reflecting this in the number of entries in the
ev_qualifier_ids.nr variable, fix it.

This was done with the most minimalistic way, reusing the index variable
'i', a followup patch will further clean this by making 'i' renamed to
'nr_used' and using 'nr_allocated' in a few more places.
