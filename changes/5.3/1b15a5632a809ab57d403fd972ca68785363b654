bus: hisi_lpc: Unregister logical PIO range to avoid potential use-after-free

If, after registering a logical PIO range, the driver probe later fails,
the logical PIO range memory will be released automatically.

This causes an issue, in that the logical PIO range is not unregistered
and the released range memory may be later referenced.

Fix by unregistering the logical PIO range.

And since we now unregister the logical PIO range for probe failure, avoid
the special ordering of setting logical PIO range ops, which was the
previous (poor) attempt at a safeguard against this.
