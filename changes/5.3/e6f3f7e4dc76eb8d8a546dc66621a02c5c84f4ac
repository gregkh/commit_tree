spi: Add spi_is_bpw_supported()

This let SPI clients check if the controller supports a particular word
width. drivers/gpu/drm/tinydrm/mipi-dbi.c will use this to determine if
the controller supports 16-bit for RGB565 pixels. If it doesn't it will
swap the bytes before transfer on little endian machines.
