libbpf: refactor map initialization

User and global data maps initialization has gotten pretty complicated
and unnecessarily convoluted. This patch splits out the logic for global
data map and user-defined map initialization. It also removes the
restriction of pre-calculating how many maps will be initialized,
instead allowing to keep adding new maps as they are discovered, which
will be used later for BTF-defined map definitions.
