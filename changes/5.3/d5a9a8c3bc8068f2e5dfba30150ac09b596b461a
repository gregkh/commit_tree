rcu: Set a maximum limit for back-to-back callback invocation

Currently, if a CPU has more than 10,000 callbacks pending, it will
increase rdp->blimit to LONG_MAX.  If you are lucky, LONG_MAX is only
about two billion, but this is still a bit too many callbacks to invoke
back-to-back while otherwise ignoring the world.

This commit therefore sets a maximum limit of DEFAULT_MAX_RCU_BLIMIT,
which is set to 10,000, for rdp->blimit.
