nl80211: fill all policy .type entries

For old commands, it's fine to have .type = NLA_UNSPEC and it
behaves the same as NLA_MIN_LEN. However, for new commands with
strict validation this is no longer true, and for policy export
to userspace these are also ignored.

Fix up the remaining ones that don't have a type.
