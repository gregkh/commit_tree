x86/paravirt: Detect over-sized patching bugs in paravirt_patch_call()

paravirt_patch_call() currently handles patching failures inconsistently:
we generate a warning in the retpoline case, but don't in other cases where
we might end up with a non-working kernel as well.

So just convert it all to a BUG_ON(), these patching calls are *not* supposed
to fail, and if they do we want to know it immediately.

This also makes the kernel smaller and removes an #ifdef ugly.

I tried it with a richly paravirt-enabled kernel and no patching bugs
were detected.
