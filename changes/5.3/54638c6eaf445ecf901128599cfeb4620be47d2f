net: phy: make exported variables non-static

The variables phy_basic_ports_array, phy_fibre_port_array and
phy_all_ports_features_array are declared static and marked
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), which is at best an odd combination.
Because the variables were decided to be a part of API, this commit
removes the static attributes and adds the declarations to the header.
