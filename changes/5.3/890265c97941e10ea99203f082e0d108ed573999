arm64: dts: amlogic: remove ethernet-phy-idAAAA.BBBB compatible strings

The Ethernet PHY documentation
(Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/phy.txt) states that:
  If the PHY reports an incorrect ID (or none at all) then the
  "compatible" list may contain an entry with the correct PHY ID in the
  form: "ethernet-phy-idAAAA.BBBB"

An older version of the documentation suggested that the compatible
string can be used when the PHY ID is known.

Remove the ethernet-phy-id compatible string and add a comment with the
PHY ID instead.
This is a no-op on boards which are shipped with the PHY that was
listed (= all known cases). However, if a board manufacturer decides to
ship a different PHY we will now load and use the correct driver because
we ask the PHY to identify itself.
