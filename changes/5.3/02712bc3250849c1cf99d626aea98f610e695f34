mm/hmm: move hmm_vma_range_done and hmm_vma_fault to nouveau

These two functions are marked as a legacy APIs to get rid of, but seem to
suit the current nouveau flow.  Move it to the only user in preparation
for fixing a locking bug involving caller and callee.  All comments
referring to the old API have been removed as this now is a driver private
helper.
