net/ethernet/qlogic/qed: force the string buffer NULL-terminated

strncpy() does not ensure NULL-termination when the input string
size equals to the destination buffer size 30.
The output string is passed to qed_int_deassertion_aeu_bit()
which calls DP_INFO() and relies NULL-termination.

Use strlcpy instead. The other conditional branch above strncpy()
needs no fix as snprintf() ensures NULL-termination.

This issue is identified by a Coccinelle script.
