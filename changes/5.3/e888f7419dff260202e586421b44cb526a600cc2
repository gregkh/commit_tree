s390: do not pass $(LINUXINCLUDE) to gen_opcode_table.c

I guess HOSTCFLAGS_gen_opcode_table.o was blindly copied from
HOSTCFLAGS_gen_facilities.o

The reason of adding $(LINUXINCLUDE) to HOSTCFLAGS_gen_facilities.o
is because gen_facilities.c references some CONFIG options. (Kbuild
does not cater to this for host tools automatically.)

On the other hand, gen_opcode_table.c does not reference CONFIG
options at all. So, there is no good reason to pass $(LINUXINCLUDE).
