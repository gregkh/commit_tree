spi: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct spi_replaced_transfers {
	...
        struct spi_transfer inserted_transfers[];
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

insert * sizeof(struct spi_transfer) + sizeof(struct spi_replaced_transfers)

with:

struct_size(rxfer, inserted_transfers, insert)
