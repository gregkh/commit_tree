powerpc/64s/exception: remove bad stack branch

The bad stack test in interrupt handlers has a few problems. For
performance it is taken in the common case, which is a fetch bubble
and a waste of i-cache.

For code development and maintainence, it requires yet another stack
frame setup routine, and that constrains all exception handlers to
follow the same register save pattern which inhibits future
optimisation.

Remove the test/branch and replace it with a trap. Teach the program
check handler to use the emergency stack for this case.

This does not result in quite so nice a message, however the SRR0 and
SRR1 of the crashed interrupt can be seen in r11 and r12, as is the
original r1 (adjusted by INT_FRAME_SIZE). These are the most important
parts to debugging the issue.

The original r9-12 and cr0 is lost, which is the main downside.
