bcache: remove unnecessary prefetch() in bset_search_tree()

In function bset_search_tree(), when p >= t->size, t->tree[0] will be
prefetched by the following code piece,
 974                 unsigned int p = n << 4;
 975
 976                 p &= ((int) (p - t->size)) >> 31;
 977
 978                 prefetch(&t->tree[p]);

The purpose of the above code is to avoid a branch instruction, but
when p >= t->size, prefetch(&t->tree[0]) has no positive performance
contribution at all. This patch avoids the unncessary prefetch by only
calling prefetch() when p < t->size.
