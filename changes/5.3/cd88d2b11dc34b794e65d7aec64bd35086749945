staging: kpc2000: added separate show functions for kpc_uio_class device attributes, defined them as read-only and declared them static.

Defined separate simple show functions for each attribute instead of
having a one big one containing a chain of conditionals.

Replaced scnprintf calls with sprintf since all the outputs are short
bounded strings or single integers.

All of the device attributes are read-only, so used DEVICE_ATTR_RO to
define them.

The definitions are only used to populate the kpc_uio_class_attrs
attribute array, so declared them as static.

Fixes the following sparse warnings:
