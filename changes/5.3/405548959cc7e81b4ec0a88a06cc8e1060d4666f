s390/qeth: add support for dynamically allocated cmds

qeth currently uses a fixed set of statically allocated cmd buffers for
the read and write IO channels. This (1) doesn't play well with the single
RCD cmd we need to issue on the data channel, (2) doesn't provide the
necessary flexibility for certain IDX improvements, and (3) is also rather
wasteful since the buffers are idle most of the time.

Add a new type of cmd buffer that is dynamically allocated, and keeps
its ccw chain in the DMA data area. Since this touches most callers of
qeth_setup_ccw(), also add a new CCW flags parameter for future usage.
