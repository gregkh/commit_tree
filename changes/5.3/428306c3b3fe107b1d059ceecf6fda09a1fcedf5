ASoC: soc-pcm: fixup try_module_get()/module_put() timing

soc_pcm_components_open/close() try to call
try_module_get()/module_put() based on
component->driver->module_get_upon_open.

Here, the purpose why we need to call these functions are to
checking module reference.
Thus, we need to call try_module_open() even though it doesn't
have .open callback.

The same reason, we need to call module_put() even though it
doesn't have .close

This patch calls try_module_get()/module_put() regardless of
.open/.close
