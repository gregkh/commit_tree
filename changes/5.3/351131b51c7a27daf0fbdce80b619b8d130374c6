libbpf: add btf_dump API for BTF-to-C conversion

BTF contains enough type information to allow generating valid
compilable C header w/ correct layout of structs/unions and all the
typedef/enum definitions. This patch adds a new "object" - btf_dump to
facilitate dumping BTF as valid C. btf_dump__dump_type() is the main API
which takes care of dumping out (through user-provided printf-like
callback function) C definitions for given type ID and it's required
dependencies. This allows for not just dumping out entirety of BTF types,
but also selective filtering based on user-provided criterias w/ minimal
set of dependent types.
