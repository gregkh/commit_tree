docs: zh_CN: get rid of basic_profiling.txt

Changeset 5700d1974818 ("docs: Get rid of the "basic profiling" guide")
removed an old basic-profiling.txt file that was not updated over
the last 11 years and won't reflect the post-perf era.

It makes no sense to keep its translation, so get rid of it too.
