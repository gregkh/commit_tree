modules: page-align module section allocations only for arches supporting strict module rwx

We should keep the case of "#define debug_align(X) (X)" for all arches
without CONFIG_HAS_STRICT_MODULE_RWX ability, which would save people, who
are sensitive to system size, a lot of memory when using modules,
especially for embedded systems. This is also the intention of the
original #ifdef... statement and still valid for now.

Note that this still keeps the effect of the fix of the following commit,
38f054d549a8 ("modules: always page-align module section allocations"),
since when CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_STRICT_MODULE_RWX is enabled, module pages are
aligned.
