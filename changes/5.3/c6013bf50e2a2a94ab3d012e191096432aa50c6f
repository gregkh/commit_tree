iio: adc: stm32-dfsdm: fix data type

Fix the data type as DFSDM raw output is complements 2,
24bits left aligned in a 32-bit register.
This change does not affect AUDIO path
- Set data as signed for IIO (as for AUDIO)
- Set 8 bit right shift for IIO.
The 8 LSBs bits of data contains channel info and are masked.
