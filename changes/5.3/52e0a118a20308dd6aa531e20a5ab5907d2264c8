RDMA/restrack: Track driver QP types in resource tracker

The check for QP type different than XRC has excluded driver QP
types from the resource tracker.
As a result, "rdma resource show" user command would not show opened
driver QPs which does not reflect the real state of the system.

Check QP type explicitly instead of assuming enum values/ordering.
