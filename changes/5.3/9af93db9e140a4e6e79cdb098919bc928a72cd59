platform/x86: asus: Rename "fan mode" to "fan boost mode"

The Asus WMI spec indicates that the function being controlled here
is called "Fan Boost Mode". The user-facing documentation also calls it
this.

The spec uses the term "fan mode" is used to refer to other things,
including functionality expected to appear on future products.
We missed this before as we are not dealing with the most readable of
specs, and didn't forsee any confusion around shortening the name.

Rename "fan mode" to "fan boost mode" to improve consistency with the
spec and to avoid a future naming conflict.

There is no interface breakage here since this has yet to be included
in an official kernel release. I also updated the kernel version listed
under ABI accordingly.
