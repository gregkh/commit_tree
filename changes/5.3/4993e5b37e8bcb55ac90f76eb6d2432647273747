net: stmmac: Re-work the queue selection for TSO packets

Ben Hutchings says:
	"This is the wrong place to change the queue mapping.
	stmmac_xmit() is called with a specific TX queue locked,
	and accessing a different TX queue results in a data race
	for all of that queue's state.

	I think this commit should be reverted upstream and in all
	stable branches.  Instead, the driver should implement the
	ndo_select_queue operation and override the queue mapping there."
