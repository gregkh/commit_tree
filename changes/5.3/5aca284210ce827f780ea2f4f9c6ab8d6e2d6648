vfs: create a generic checking and prep function for FS_IOC_SETFLAGS

Create a generic function to check incoming FS_IOC_SETFLAGS flag values
and later prepare the inode for updates so that we can standardize the
implementations that follow ext4's flag values.

Note that the efivarfs implementation no longer fails a no-op SETFLAGS
without CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE since that's the behavior in ext*.
