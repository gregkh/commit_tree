ASoC: SOF: disallow building without CONFIG_PCI again

Compile-testing without PCI just causes warnings:

sound/soc/sof/sof-pci-dev.c:330:13: error: 'sof_pci_remove' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
 static void sof_pci_remove(struct pci_dev *pci)
             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
sound/soc/sof/sof-pci-dev.c:230:12: error: 'sof_pci_probe' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
 static int sof_pci_probe(struct pci_dev *pci,
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~

I tried to fix this in a way that would still allow compile
tests, but it got too ugly, so this just reverts the patch
that allowed it in the first place.

Most architectures do allow enabling PCI, so the value of the
COMPILE_TEST alternative was not very high to start with.
