libbpf: use negative fd to specify missing BTF

0 is a valid FD, so it's better to initialize it to -1, as is done in
other places. Also, technically, BTF type ID 0 is valid (it's a VOID
type), so it's more reliable to check btf_fd, instead of
btf_key_type_id, to determine if there is any BTF associated with a map.
