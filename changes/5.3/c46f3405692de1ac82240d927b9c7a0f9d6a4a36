tpm: Reserve the TPM final events table

UEFI systems provide a boot services protocol for obtaining the TPM
event log, but this is unusable after ExitBootServices() is called.
Unfortunately ExitBootServices() itself triggers additional TPM events
that then can't be obtained using this protocol. The platform provides a
mechanism for the OS to obtain these events by recording them to a
separate UEFI configuration table which the OS can then map.

Unfortunately this table isn't self describing in terms of providing its
length, so we need to parse the events inside it to figure out how long
it is. Since the table isn't mapped at this point, we need to extend the
length calculation function to be able to map the event as it goes
along.
