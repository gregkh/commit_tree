eeprom: ee1004: Deal with nack on page selection

Some EE1004 implementations will not properly ack page selection
commands. They still set the page correctly, so there is no actual
error. Deal with this case gracefully by checking the currently
selected page after we receive a nack. If the page is set right then
we can continue.
