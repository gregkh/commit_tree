ALSA: pcm: Fix refcount_inc() on zero usage

The recent rewrite of PCM link lock management introduced the refcount
in snd_pcm_group object, managed by the kernel refcount_t API.  This
caused unexpected kernel warnings when the kernel is built with
CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL=y.  As the warning line indicates, the problem is
obviously that we start with refcount=0 and do refcount_inc() for
adding each PCM link, while refcount_t API doesn't like refcount_inc()
performed on zero.

For adapting the proper refcount_t usage, this patch changes the logic
slightly:
- The initial refcount is 1, assuming the single list entry
- The refcount is incremented / decremented at each PCM link addition
  and deletion
- ... which allows us concentrating only on the refcount as a release
  condition
