x86: Add support for Linux guests on an ACRN hypervisor

ACRN is an open-source hypervisor maintained by The Linux Foundation. It
is built for embedded IOT with small footprint and real-time features.
Add ACRN guest support so that it allows Linux to be booted under the
ACRN hypervisor. This adds only the barebones implementation.
