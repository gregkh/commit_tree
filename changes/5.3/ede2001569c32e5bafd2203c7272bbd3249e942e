i3c: master: Use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*defslvs) + ((ndevs - 1) * sizeof(struct i3c_ccc_dev_desc))

with:

struct_size(defslvs, slaves, ndevs - 1)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
