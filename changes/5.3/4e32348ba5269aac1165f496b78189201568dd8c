iommu: Introduce device fault data

Device faults detected by IOMMU can be reported outside the IOMMU
subsystem for further processing. This patch introduces
a generic device fault data structure.

The fault can be either an unrecoverable fault or a page request,
also referred to as a recoverable fault.

We only care about non internal faults that are likely to be reported
to an external subsystem.
