ice: Call out dev/func caps when printing

ice_parse_caps is used to parse both device and function capabilities.
Currently, capabilities are printed with a cryptic "HW caps" prefix,
which makes it difficult to distinguish whether the capabilities being
printed are device or function capabilities.

This patch makes a change to add a "func cap" prefix when printing
function capabilities, and a "dev cap" prefix when printing device
capabilities.

This patch also changes some of the capability print strings for
consistency.
