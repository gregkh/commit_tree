docs: usb: rename files to .rst and add them to drivers-api

While there are a mix of things here, most of the stuff
were written from Kernel developer's PoV. So, add them to
the driver-api book.

A follow up for this patch would be to move documents from
there that are specific to sysadmins, adding them to the
admin-guide.
