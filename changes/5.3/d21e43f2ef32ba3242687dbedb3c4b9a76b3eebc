kselftests: timers: freq-step: Update maximum acceptable precision and errors

PTI has a significant impact on precision of the MONOTONIC_RAW clock,
which prevents a lot of computers from running the freq-step test.
Increase the maximum acceptable precision for the test to not be skipped
to 500 nanoseconds.

After commit 78b98e3c5a66 ("timekeeping/ntp: Determine the multiplier
directly from NTP tick length") the frequency and time errors should be
much smaller. Reduce the maximum acceptable values for the test to pass
to 0.02 ppm and 50 nanoseconds respectively.
