netlink: use 48 byte ctx instead of 6 signed longs for callback

People are inclined to stuff random things into cb->args[n] because it
looks like an array of integers. Sometimes people even put u64s in there
with comments noting that a certain member takes up two slots. The
horror! Really this should mirror the usage of skb->cb, which are just
48 opaque bytes suitable for casting a struct. Then people can create
their usual casting macros for accessing strongly typed members of a
struct.

As a plus, this also gives us the same amount of space on 32bit and 64bit.
