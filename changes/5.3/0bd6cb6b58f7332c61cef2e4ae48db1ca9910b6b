drm/i915: Skip shrinking already freed pages

Previously, we wanted to shrink the pages of freed objects before they
were finally RCU collected. However, by removing the struct_mutex
serialisation around the active reference, we need to acquire an extra
reference around the wait. Unfortunately this means that we have to skip
objects that are waiting RCU collection.
