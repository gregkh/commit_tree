Btrfs: add missing inode version, ctime and mtime updates when punching hole

If the range for which we are punching a hole covers only part of a page,
we end up updating the inode item but we skip the update of the inode's
iversion, mtime and ctime. Fix that by ensuring we update those properties
of the inode.

A patch for fstests test case generic/059 that tests this as been sent
along with this fix.
