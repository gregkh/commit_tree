perf record: Add support to collect callchains from kernel or user space only

One can just record callchains in the kernel or user space with this new
options.

We can use it together with "--all-kernel" options.

This two options is used just like print_stack(sys) or print_ustack(usr)
for systemtap.

Shown below is the usage of this new option combined with "--all-kernel"
options:

1. Configure all used events to run in kernel space and just collect
   kernel callchains.

  $ perf record -a -g --all-kernel --kernel-callchains

2. Configure all used events to run in kernel space and just collect
   user callchains.

  $ perf record -a -g --all-kernel --user-callchains

Committer notes:

Improved documentation to state that asking for kernel callchains really
is asking for excluding user callchains, and vice versa.

Further mentioned that using both won't get both, but nothing, as both
will be excluded.
