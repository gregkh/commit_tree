scsi: lpfc: Fix PT2PT PLOGI collison stopping discovery

Under heavy load the target stops responding, the drivers aborts
timeout and we start recovery by logging out of the target, but
the target is never logged into again.

In a point-to-point scenario, there were battling PLOGI's. When we
received a PLOGI request after having sent one, the driver cancels
the processing of the original plogi. However, the completion path
of the remaining plogi was coded to skip the reg_rpi that should
be happening on the 2nd plogi.

Correct by adding a simple pt2pt check such that the 2nd plogi isn't
skipped and the reg_login occurs.
