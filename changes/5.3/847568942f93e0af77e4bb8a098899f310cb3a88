xprtrdma: Remove fr_state

Now that both the Send and Receive completions are handled in
process context, it is safe to DMA unmap and return MRs to the
free or recycle lists directly in the completion handlers.

Doing this means rpcrdma_frwr no longer needs to track the state of
each MR, meaning that a VALID or FLUSHED MR can no longer appear on
an xprt's MR free list. Thus there is no longer a need to track the
MR's registration state in rpcrdma_frwr.
