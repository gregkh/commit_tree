gpiolib: never report open-drain/source lines as 'input' to user-space

If the driver doesn't support open-drain/source config options, we
emulate this behavior when setting the direction by calling
gpiod_direction_input() if the default value is 0 (open-source) or
1 (open-drain), thus not actively driving the line in those cases.

This however clears the FLAG_IS_OUT bit for the GPIO line descriptor
and makes the LINEINFO ioctl() incorrectly report this line's mode as
'input' to user-space.

This commit modifies the ioctl() to always set the GPIOLINE_FLAG_IS_OUT
bit in the lineinfo structure's flags field. Since it's impossible to
use the input mode and open-drain/source options at the same time, we
can be sure the reported information will be correct.
