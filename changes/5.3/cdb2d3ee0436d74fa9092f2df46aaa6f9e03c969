arm64: KVM: hyp: debug-sr: Mark expected switch fall-through

When fall-through warnings was enabled by default the following warnings
was starting to show up:

../arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/debug-sr.c: In function ‘__debug_save_state’:
../arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/debug-sr.c:20:19: warning: this statement may fall
 through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  case 15: ptr[15] = read_debug(reg, 15);   \
../arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/debug-sr.c:113:2: note: in expansion of macro ‘save_debug’
  save_debug(dbg->dbg_bcr, dbgbcr, brps);

Rework to add a 'Fall through' comment where the compiler warned
about fall-through, hence silencing the warning.
