ACPI: PM: Avoid evaluating _PS3 on transitions from D3hot to D3cold

If the power state of a device with ACPI PM is changed from D3hot to
D3cold, it merely is a matter of dropping references to additional
power resources (specifically, those in the list returned by _PR3),
and the _PS3 method should not be invoked for the device then (as
it has already been evaluated during the previous transition to
D3hot).
