habanalabs: fix host memory polling in BE architecture

This patch fix a bug in the host memory polling macro. The bug is that the
memory being polled can be written by the device, which always writes it
in LE. However, if the host is running Linux in BE mode, we need to
convert the value that was written by the device before matching it to the
required value that the caller has given to the macro.
