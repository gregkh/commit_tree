RDMA/core: Validate integrity handover device cap

Protect the case that a ULP tries to allocate a QP with signature
enabled flag while the LLD doesn't support this feature.
While we're here, also move integrity_en attribute from mlx5_qp to
ib_qp as a preparation for adding new integrity API to the rw-API
(that is part of ib_core module).
