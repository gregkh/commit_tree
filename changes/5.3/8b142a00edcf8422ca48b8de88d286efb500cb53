net_sched: check cops->tcf_block in tc_bind_tclass()

At least sch_red and sch_tbf don't implement ->tcf_block()
while still have a non-zero tc "class".

Instead of adding nop implementations to each of such qdisc's,
we can just relax the check of cops->tcf_block() in
tc_bind_tclass(). They don't support TC filter anyway.
