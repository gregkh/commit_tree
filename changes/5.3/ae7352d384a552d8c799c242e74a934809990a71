inet: frags: call inet_frags_fini() after unregister_pernet_subsys()

Both IPv6 and 6lowpan are calling inet_frags_fini() too soon.

inet_frags_fini() is dismantling a kmem_cache, that might be needed
later when unregister_pernet_subsys() eventually has to remove
frags queues from hash tables and free them.

This fixes potential use-after-free, and is a prereq for the following patch.
