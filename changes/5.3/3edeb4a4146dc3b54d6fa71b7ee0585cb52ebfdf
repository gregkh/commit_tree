SMB3: Fix potential memory leak when processing compound chain

When a reconnect happens in the middle of processing a compound chain
the code leaks a buffer from the memory pool. Fix this by properly
checking for a return code and freeing buffers in case of error.

Also maintain a buf variable to be equal to either smallbuf or bigbuf
depending on a response buffer size while parsing a chain and when
returning to the caller.
