selftests/bpf: adjust verifier scale test

Adjust scale tests to check for new jmp sequence limit.

BPF_JGT had to be changed to BPF_JEQ because the verifier was
too smart. It tracked the known safe range of R0 values
and pruned the search earlier before hitting exact 8192 limit.
bpf_semi_rand_get() was too (un)?lucky.

k = 0; was missing in bpf_fill_scale2.
It was testing a bit shorter sequence of jumps than intended.
