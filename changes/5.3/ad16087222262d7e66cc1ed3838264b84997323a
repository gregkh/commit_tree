s390/qeth: simplify DOWN state handling

When the tear down sequence in qeth_l?_stop_card() has finished, the
card is guaranteed to be in DOWN state and we don't have to check for
it again.
With this insight we can also remove the redundant setting of
card->state in qeth_l?_set_online()'s error path.
