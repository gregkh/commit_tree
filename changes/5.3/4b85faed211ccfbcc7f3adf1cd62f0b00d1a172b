dma-mapping: add a dma_alloc_need_uncached helper

Check if we need to allocate uncached memory for a device given the
allocation flags.  Switch over the uncached segment check to this helper
to deal with architectures that do not support the dma_cache_sync
operation and thus should not returned cacheable memory for
DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT allocations.
