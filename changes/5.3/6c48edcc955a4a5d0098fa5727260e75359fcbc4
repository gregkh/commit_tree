ARM: configs: Remove useless UEVENT_HELPER_PATH

Remove the CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH because:
1. It is disabled since commit 1be01d4a5714 ("driver: base: Disable
   CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER by default") as its dependency (UEVENT_HELPER) was
   made default to 'n',
2. It is not recommended (help message: "This should not be used today
   [...] creates a high system load") and was kept only for ancient
   userland,
3. Certain userland specifically requests it to be disabled (systemd
   README: "Legacy hotplug slows down the system and confuses udev").
