NTB: ntb_perf: Clear stale values in doorbell and command SPAD register

when ntb_perf is unloaded, the command scratchpad register still
retains the last initialized value of PERF_CMD_INVAL. When ntb_perf
is re-loaded and reads peer command scratchpad register and it mis
interprets the peer state as initialized.

To avoid this, clearing the local side command scratchpad register
in perf_disable_service
