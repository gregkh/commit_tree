btrfs: fiemap: preallocate ulists for btrfs_check_shared

btrfs_check_shared looks up parents of a given extent and uses ulists
for that. These are allocated and freed repeatedly. Preallocation in the
caller will avoid the overhead and also allow us to use the GFP_KERNEL
as it is happens before the extent locks are taken.
