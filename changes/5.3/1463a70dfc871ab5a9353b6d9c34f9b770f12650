arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-main: Add Main NavSS Interrupt controller node

Add the Interrupt controller node for the Interrupt Router present within
the Main NavSS module. This Interrupt Router can route 192 interrupts to
the GIC_SPI in 3 sets of 64 interrupts each. Note that the last set is
reserved for the host ID A72_3 for hypervisor usecases, so the node is
added only with 2 sets for the Linux kernel context (host id A72_2). This
is specified through the ti,sci-rm-range-girq property.
