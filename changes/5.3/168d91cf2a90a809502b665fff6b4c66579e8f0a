iavf: use signed variable

The counter variable in iavf_clean_tx_irq starts out negative and climbs
to 0. So allocating it as u16 is actually a really bad idea that just
happens to work because the value underflows and overflows consistently
on most architectures.

Replace the u16 with an int so signed math works as expected.
