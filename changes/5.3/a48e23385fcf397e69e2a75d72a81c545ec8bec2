platform/x86: wmi: add context pointer field to struct wmi_device_id

When using wmi_install_notify_handler() to initialize a WMI handler a
data pointer can be supplied which will be passed on to the notification
handler. No similar feature exist when handling WMI events via struct
wmi_driver.

Add a context field pointer to struct wmi_device_id and add a function
find_guid_context() to retrieve that context pointer.
