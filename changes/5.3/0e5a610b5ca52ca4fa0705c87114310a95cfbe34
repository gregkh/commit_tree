ppp: mppe: switch to RC4 library interface

The MPPE code uses the sync skcipher to invoke the ecb(arc4) skcipher,
of which only a single generic C code implementation exists. This means
that going through all the trouble of using scatterlists etc buys us
very little, and we're better off just invoking the arc4 library directly.

Note that the SHA1 shash used by this driver has several accelerated
implementations for various architectures, so retaining that part does
make sense.
