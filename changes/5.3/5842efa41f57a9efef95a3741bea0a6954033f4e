soc: fsl: dpio: Add support for memory backed QBMan portals

NXP devices with QBMan version 5 and above can enable software
portals that are memory backed. This allows the portal to be
mapped as cacheable/sharable (same as all normal memory) so
that portals can freely migrate between cores and clusters
in the SoC. The driver will enable this mode by default when
appropriate HW support is detected.
