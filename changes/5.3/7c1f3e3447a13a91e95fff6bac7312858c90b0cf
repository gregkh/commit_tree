scsi: mac_scsi: Treat Last Byte Sent time-out as failure

A system bus error during a PDMA send operation can result in bytes being
lost. Theoretically that could cause the target to remain in DATA OUT phase
and the initiator (expecting a phase change) would time-out waiting for the
Last Byte Sent flag. Should that happen, fail the transfer so the core
driver will stop using PDMA with this target.
