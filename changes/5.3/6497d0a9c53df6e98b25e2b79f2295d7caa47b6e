IB/hfi1: Fix Spectre v1 vulnerability

sl is controlled by user-space, hence leading to a potential
exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

Fix this by sanitizing sl before using it to index ibp->sl_to_sc.

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
