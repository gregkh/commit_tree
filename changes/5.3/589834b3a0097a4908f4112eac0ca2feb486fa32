kbuild: Add -Werror=unknown-warning-option to CLANG_FLAGS

In commit ebcc5928c5d9 ("arm64: Silence gcc warnings about arch ABI
drift"), the arm64 Makefile added -Wno-psabi to KBUILD_CFLAGS, which is
a GCC only option so clang rightfully complains:

warning: unknown warning option '-Wno-psabi' [-Wunknown-warning-option]

https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html#wunknown-warning-option

However, by default, this is merely a warning so the build happily goes
on with a slew of these warnings in the process.

Commit c3f0d0bc5b01 ("kbuild, LLVMLinux: Add -Werror to cc-option to
support clang") worked around this behavior in cc-option by adding
-Werror so that unknown flags cause an error. However, this all happens
silently and when an unknown flag is added to the build unconditionally
like -Wno-psabi, cc-option will always fail because there is always an
unknown flag in the list of flags. This manifested as link time failures
in the arm64 libstub because -fno-stack-protector didn't get added to
KBUILD_CFLAGS.

To avoid these weird cryptic failures in the future, make clang behave
like gcc and immediately error when it encounters an unknown flag by
adding -Werror=unknown-warning-option to CLANG_FLAGS. This can be added
unconditionally for clang because it is supported by at least 3.0.0,
according to godbolt [1] and 4.0.0, according to its documentation [2],
which is far earlier than we typically support.
