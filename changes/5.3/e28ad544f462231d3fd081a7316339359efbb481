drm/edid: parse CEA blocks embedded in DisplayID

DisplayID blocks allow embedding of CEA blocks. The payloads are
identical to traditional top level CEA extension blocks, but the header
is slightly different.

This change allows the CEA parser to find a CEA block inside a DisplayID
block. Additionally, it adds support for parsing the embedded CTA
header. No further changes are necessary due to payload parity.

This change fixes audio support for the Valve Index HMD.
