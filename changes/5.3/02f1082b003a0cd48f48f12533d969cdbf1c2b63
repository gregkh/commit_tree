locking/rwsem: Clarify usage of owner's nonspinaable bit

Bit 1 of sem->owner (RWSEM_ANONYMOUSLY_OWNED) is used to designate an
anonymous owner - readers or an anonymous writer. The setting of this
anonymous bit is used as an indicator that optimistic spinning cannot
be done on this rwsem.

With the upcoming reader optimistic spinning patches, a reader-owned
rwsem can be spinned on for a limit period of time. We still need
this bit to indicate a rwsem is nonspinnable, but not setting this
bit loses its meaning that the owner is known. So rename the bit
to RWSEM_NONSPINNABLE to clarify its meaning.

This patch also fixes a DEBUG_RWSEMS_WARN_ON() bug in __up_write().
