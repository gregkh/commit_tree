netlink: Add field to skip in-kernel notifications

The struct includes a 'skip_notify' flag that indicates if netlink
notifications to user space should be suppressed. As explained in commit
3b1137fe7482 ("net: ipv6: Change notifications for multipath add to
RTA_MULTIPATH"), this is useful to suppress per-nexthop RTM_NEWROUTE
notifications when an IPv6 multipath route is added / deleted. Instead,
one notification is sent for the entire multipath route.

This concept is also useful for in-kernel notifications. Sending one
in-kernel notification for the addition / deletion of an IPv6 multipath
route - instead of one per-nexthop - provides a significant increase in
the insertion / deletion rate to underlying devices.

Add a 'skip_notify_kernel' flag to suppress in-kernel notifications.
