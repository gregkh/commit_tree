netfilter: nf_flow_table: conntrack picks up expired flows

Update conntrack entry to pick up expired flows, otherwise the conntrack
entry gets stuck with the internal offload timeout (one day). The TCP
state also needs to be adjusted to ESTABLISHED state and tracking is set
to liberal mode in order to give conntrack a chance to pick up the
expired flow.
