mfd: cros_ec: differentiate SCP from EC by feature bit

System Companion Processor (SCP) is Cortex M4 co-processor on some
MediaTek platform that can run EC-style firmware. Since a SCP and EC
would both exist on a system, and use the cros_ec_dev driver, we need to
differentiate between them for the userspace, or they would both be
registered at /dev/cros_ec, causing a conflict.
