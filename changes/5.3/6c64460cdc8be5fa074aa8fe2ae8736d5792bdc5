btrfs: shut up bogus -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning

gcc sometimes can't determine whether a variable has been initialized
when both the initialization and the use are conditional:

fs/btrfs/props.c: In function 'inherit_props':
fs/btrfs/props.c:389:4: error: 'num_bytes' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    btrfs_block_rsv_release(fs_info, trans->block_rsv,

This code is fine. Unfortunately, I cannot think of a good way to
rephrase it in a way that makes gcc understand this, so I add a bogus
initialization the way one should not.
