coresight: Use platform agnostic names

So far we have reused the name of the "platform" device for
the CoreSight device. But this is not very intuitive when
we move to ACPI. Also, the ACPI device names have ":" in them
(e.g, ARMHC97C:01), which the perf tool doesn't like very much.
This patch introduces a generic naming scheme, givin more intuitive
names for the devices that appear on the CoreSight bus.
The names follow the pattern "prefix" followed by "index" (e.g, etm5).
We maintain a list of allocated devices per "prefix" to make sure
we don't allocate a new name when it is reprobed (e.g, due to
unsatisifed device dependencies). So, we maintain the list
of "fwnodes" of the parent devices to allocate a consistent name.
All devices except the ETMs get an index allocated in the order
of probing. ETMs get an index based on the CPU they are attached to.

TMC devices are named using "tmc_etf", "tmc_etb", and "tmc_etr"
prefixes depending on the configuration of the device.

The replicators and funnels are not classified as dynamic/static
anymore. One could easily figure that out by checking the presence
of "mgmt" registers under sysfs.
