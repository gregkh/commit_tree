s390/qeth: remove OSN-specific IO code

OSN currently provides a custom code path to submit IPA cmds, without
waiting for the cmd response. Replace it with qeth_send_ipa_cmd(), which
uses the common qeth_send_control_data() IO infrastructure.

By setting a custom iob->callback, we can now provide feedback to the
caller about whether the cmd has been successfully submitted to HW.
Since the callback then immediately wakes up the reply-waiter object, we
maintain the old behaviour of returning early without waiting for the
response.
