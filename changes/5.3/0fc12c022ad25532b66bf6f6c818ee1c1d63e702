powerpc/irq: Don't WARN continuously in arch_local_irq_restore()

When CONFIG_PPC_IRQ_SOFT_MASK_DEBUG is enabled (uncommon), we have a
series of WARN_ON's in arch_local_irq_restore().

These are "should never happen" conditions, but if they do happen they
can flood the console and render the system unusable. So switch them
to WARN_ON_ONCE().

Fixes: 9b81c0211c24 ("powerpc/64s: make PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS track MSR[EE] closely")
