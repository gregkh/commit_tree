cifs: replace various strncpy with strscpy and similar

Using strscpy is cleaner, and avoids some problems with
handling maximum length strings.  Linus noticed the
original problem and Aurelien pointed out some additional
problems. Fortunately most of this is SMB1 code (and
in particular the ASCII string handling older, which
is less common).
