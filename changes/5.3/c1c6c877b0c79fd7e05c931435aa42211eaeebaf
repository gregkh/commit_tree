ALSA: hda - Don't override global PCM hw info flag

The commit bfcba288b97f ("ALSA - hda: Add support for link audio time
reporting") introduced the conditional PCM hw info setup, but it
overwrites the global azx_pcm_hw object.  This will cause a problem if
any other HD-audio controller, as it'll inherit the same bit flag
although another controller doesn't support that feature.

Fix the bug by setting the PCM hw info flag locally.
