drm/i915: Allow multiple user handles to the same VM

It was noted that we made the same mistake for VM_ID as for object
handles, whereby we ensured that we only allocated a single handle for
one ppgtt. This has the unfortunate consequence for userspace that they
need to reference count the handles to avoid destroying an active ID. If
we allow multiple handles to the same ppgtt, userspace can freely
unreference any handle they own without fear of destroying the same
handle in use elsewhere.
