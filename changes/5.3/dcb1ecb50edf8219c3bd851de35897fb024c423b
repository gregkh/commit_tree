ipv4: Prepare for fib6_nh from a nexthop object

Convert more IPv4 code to use fib_nh_common over fib_nh to enable routes
to use a fib6_nh based nexthop. In the end, only code not using a
nexthop object in a fib_info should directly access fib_nh in a fib_info
without checking the famiy and going through fib_nh_common. Those
functions will be marked when it is not directly evident.
