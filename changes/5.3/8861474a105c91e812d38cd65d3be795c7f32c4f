Revert "mmc: tmio: move runtime PM enablement to the driver implementations"

This reverts commit 7ff213193310ef8d0ee5f04f79d791210787ac2c.

It turns out that the above commit introduces other problems. For example,
calling pm_runtime_set_active() must not be done prior calling
pm_runtime_enable() as that makes it fail. This leads to additional
problems, such as clock enables being wrongly balanced.

Rather than fixing the problem on top, let's start over by doing a revert.
