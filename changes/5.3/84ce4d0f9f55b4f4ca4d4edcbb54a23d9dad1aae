net: stmmac: initialize the reset delay array

Commit ce4ab73ab0c27c ("net: stmmac: drop the reset delays from struct
stmmac_mdio_bus_data") moved the reset delay array from struct
stmmac_mdio_bus_data to a stack variable.
The values from the array inside struct stmmac_mdio_bus_data were
previously initialized to 0 because the struct was allocated using
devm_kzalloc(). The array on the stack has to be initialized
explicitly, else we might be reading garbage values.

Initialize all reset delays to 0 to ensure that the values are 0 if the
"snps,reset-delays-us" property is not defined.
This fixes booting at least two boards (MIPS pistachio marduk and ARM
sun8i H2+ Orange Pi Zero). These are hanging during boot when
initializing the stmmac Ethernet controller (as found by Kernel CI).
Both have in common that they don't define the "snps,reset-delays-us"
property.
