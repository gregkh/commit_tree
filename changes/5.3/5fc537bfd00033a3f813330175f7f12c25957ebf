drm/mcde: Add new driver for ST-Ericsson MCDE

This adds a new DRM driver for the ST-Ericsson Multi Channel
Display Engine, MCDE display controller.

This hardware has three independent DSI hosts and can composit
and display several memory buffers onto an LCD display. It
was developed for several years inside of ST-Ericsson and
shipped with a few million mobile phones from Sony and Samsung,
as well as with the Snowball community development board.

The driver is currently pretty rudimentary but supports a
simple framebuffer so we can get penguins and graphics when
using these SoCs.
