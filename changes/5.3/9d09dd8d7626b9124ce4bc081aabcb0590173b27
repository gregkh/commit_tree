nvmet: add transport discovery change op

Some transports, such as FC-NVME, support discovery controller change
events without the use of a persistent discovery controller. FC receives
events via RSCN from the FC Fabric Controller or subsystem FC port.

This patch adds a nvmet transport op that is called whenever a
discovery change event occurs in the nvmet layer.

To facilitate the callback without adding another layer to cross into
core.c to reference the transport ops, the port structure snapshots
the transport ops when the port is enabled and clears them when disabled.
