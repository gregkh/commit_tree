drm/msm/dpu: add icc voting in dpu_mdss_init

dpu_mdss_destroy() can get called not just from
msm_drm_uninit() but also from msm_drm_bind() in case
of any failures.

dpu_mdss_destroy() removes the icc voting by calling
icc_put. This could accidentally remove the voting
done by pm_runtime_enable.

To make the voting balanced add a minimum vote in
dpu_mdss_init() to avoid any unclocked access.

This change depends on the following patch which
introduces interconnect binding to MDSS driver:
