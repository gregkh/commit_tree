powerpc/xmon: Fix disabling tracing while in xmon

Commit ed49f7fd6438d ("powerpc/xmon: Disable tracing when entering
xmon") added code to disable recording trace entries while in xmon. The
commit introduced a variable 'tracing_enabled' to record if tracing was
enabled on xmon entry, and used this to conditionally enable tracing
during exit from xmon.

However, we are not checking the value of 'fromipi' variable in
xmon_core() when setting 'tracing_enabled'. Due to this, when secondary
cpus enter xmon, they will see tracing as being disabled already and
tracing won't be re-enabled on exit. Fix the same.
