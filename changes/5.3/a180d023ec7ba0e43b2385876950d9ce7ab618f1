auxdisplay: ht16k33: Make ht16k33_fb_fix and ht16k33_fb_var constant

The static structures ht16k33_fb_fix and ht16k33_fb_var, of types
fb_fix_screeninfo and fb_var_screeninfo respectively, are not used
except to be copied into other variables. Hence make both of them
constant to prevent unintended modification.
Issue found with
Coccinelle.
