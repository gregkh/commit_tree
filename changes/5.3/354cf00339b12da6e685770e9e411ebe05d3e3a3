media: cec: mark devnode as registered before actually registering it

The cec device node can be used right after it was created, but that
leaves a race condition where the device was created, but devnode->registered
was still false. So an ioctl() would result in an error.

So set it to true before calling cdev_device_add() and to false again if
cdev_device_add returned an error.
