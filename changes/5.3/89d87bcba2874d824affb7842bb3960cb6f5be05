powerpc/powernv: Show checkstop reason for NPU2 HMIs

If the kernel is notified of an HMI caused by the NPU2, it's currently
not being recognized and it logs the default message:

    Unknown Malfunction Alert of type 3

The NPU on Power 9 has 3 Fault Isolation Registers, so that's a lot of
possible causes, but we should at least log that it's an NPU problem
and report which FIR and which bit were raised if opal gave us the
information.
