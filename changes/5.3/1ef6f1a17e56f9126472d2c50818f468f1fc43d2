net/mlx5: Control CR-space access by different PFs

Since the FW can be shared between different PFs/VFs it is common
that more than one health poll will detected a failure, this can
lead to multiple resets which are unneeded.

The solution is to use a FW locking mechanism using semaphore space
to provide a way to allow only one device to collect the cr-dump and
to issue a sw-reset.
