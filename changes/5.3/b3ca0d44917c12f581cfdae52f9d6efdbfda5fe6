drm/i915: remove unused IO_TLB_SEGPAGES which should be defined by swiotlb

This patch removes IO_TLB_SEGPAGES which is no longer used since
commit 5584f1b1d73e ("drm/i915: fix i915 running as dom0 under Xen").

As the define of both IO_TLB_SEGSIZE and IO_TLB_SHIFT are from swiotlb,
IO_TLB_SEGPAGES should be defined on swiotlb side if it is required in the
future.
