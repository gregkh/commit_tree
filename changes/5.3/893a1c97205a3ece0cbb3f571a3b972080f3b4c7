blk-mq: allow REQ_NOWAIT to return an error inline

By default, if a caller sets REQ_NOWAIT and we need to block, we'll
return -EAGAIN through the bio->bi_end_io() callback. For some use
cases, this makes it hard to use.

Allow a caller to ask for inline return of errors related to
blocking by also setting REQ_NOWAIT_INLINE.
