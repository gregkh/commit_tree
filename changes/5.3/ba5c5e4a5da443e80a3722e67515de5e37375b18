arm64: move jump_label_init() before parse_early_param()

While jump_label_init() was moved earlier in the boot process in
efd9e03facd0 ("arm64: Use static keys for CPU features"), it wasn't early
enough for early params to use it.  The old state of things was as
described here...

init/main.c calls out to arch-specific things before general jump label
and early param handling:

  asmlinkage __visible void __init start_kernel(void)
  {
        ...
        setup_arch(&command_line);
        ...
        smp_prepare_boot_cpu();
        ...
        /* parameters may set static keys */
        jump_label_init();
        parse_early_param();
        ...
  }

x86 setup_arch() wants those earlier, so it handles jump label and
early param:

  void __init setup_arch(char **cmdline_p)
  {
        ...
        jump_label_init();
        ...
        parse_early_param();
        ...
  }

arm64 setup_arch() only had early param:

  void __init setup_arch(char **cmdline_p)
  {
        ...
        parse_early_param();
        ...
}

with jump label later in smp_prepare_boot_cpu():

  void __init smp_prepare_boot_cpu(void)
  {
        ...
        jump_label_init();
        ...
  }

This moves arm64 jump_label_init() from smp_prepare_boot_cpu() to
setup_arch(), as done already on x86, in preparation from early param
usage in the init_on_alloc/free() series:
