bcache: set largest seq to ja->seq[bucket_index] in journal_read_bucket()

In journal_read_bucket() when setting ja->seq[bucket_index], there might
be potential case that a later non-maximum overwrites a better sequence
number to ja->seq[bucket_index]. This patch adds a check to make sure
that ja->seq[bucket_index] will be only set a new value if it is bigger
then current value.
