mm/hmm: Hold a mmgrab from hmm to mm

So long as a struct hmm pointer exists, so should the struct mm it is
linked too. Hold the mmgrab() as soon as a hmm is created, and mmdrop() it
once the hmm refcount goes to zero.

Since mmdrop() (ie a 0 kref on struct mm) is now impossible with a !NULL
mm->hmm delete the hmm_hmm_destroy().
