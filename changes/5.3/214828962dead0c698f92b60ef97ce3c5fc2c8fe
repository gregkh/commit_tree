io_uring: initialize percpu refcounters using PERCU_REF_ALLOW_REINIT

Percpu reference counters should now be initialized with the
PERCPU_REF_ALLOW_REINIT in order to allow switching them to the
percpu mode from the atomic mode. This is exactly what
percpu_ref_reinit() called from __io_uring_register() is supposed to
do. So let's initialize percpu refcounters with the
PERCU_REF_ALLOW_REINIT flag.
