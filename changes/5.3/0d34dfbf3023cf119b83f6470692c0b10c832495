clk: tegra210: fix PLLU and PLLU_OUT1

Full-speed and low-speed USB devices do not work with Tegra210
platforms because of incorrect PLLU/PLLU_OUT1 clock settings.

When full-speed device is connected:
[   14.059886] usb 1-3: new full-speed USB device number 2 using tegra-xusb
[   14.196295] usb 1-3: device descriptor read/64, error -71
[   14.436311] usb 1-3: device descriptor read/64, error -71
[   14.675749] usb 1-3: new full-speed USB device number 3 using tegra-xusb
[   14.812335] usb 1-3: device descriptor read/64, error -71
[   15.052316] usb 1-3: device descriptor read/64, error -71
[   15.164799] usb usb1-port3: attempt power cycle

When low-speed device is connected:
[   37.610949] usb usb1-port3: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?
[   38.557376] usb usb1-port3: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?
[   38.564977] usb usb1-port3: attempt power cycle

This commit fixes the issue by:
 1. initializing PLLU_OUT1 before initializing XUSB_FS_SRC clock
    because PLLU_OUT1 is parent of XUSB_FS_SRC.
 2. changing PLLU post-divider to /2 (DIVP=1) according to Technical
    Reference Manual.
