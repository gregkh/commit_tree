KVM: nVMX: Preset *DT exiting in vmcs02 when emulating UMIP

KVM dynamically toggles SECONDARY_EXEC_DESC to intercept (a subset of)
instructions that are subject to User-Mode Instruction Prevention, i.e.
VMCS.SECONDARY_EXEC_DESC == CR4.UMIP when emulating UMIP.  Preset the
VMCS control when preparing vmcs02 to avoid unnecessarily VMWRITEs,
e.g. KVM will clear VMCS.SECONDARY_EXEC_DESC in prepare_vmcs02_early()
and then set it in vmx_set_cr4().
