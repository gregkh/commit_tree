bnx2x: Prevent load reordering in tx completion processing

This patch fixes an issue seen on Power systems with bnx2x which results
in the skb is NULL WARN_ON in bnx2x_free_tx_pkt firing due to the skb
pointer getting loaded in bnx2x_free_tx_pkt prior to the hw_cons
load in bnx2x_tx_int. Adding a read memory barrier resolves the issue.
