ALSA: hda - Add a conexant codec entry to let mute led work

This conexant codec isn't in the supported codec list yet, the hda
generic driver can drive this codec well, but on a Lenovo machine
with mute/mic-mute leds, we need to apply CXT_FIXUP_THINKPAD_ACPI
to make the leds work. After adding this codec to the list, the
driver patch_conexant.c will apply THINKPAD_ACPI to this machine.
