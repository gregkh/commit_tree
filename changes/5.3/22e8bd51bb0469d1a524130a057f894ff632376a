rbd: support for object-map and fast-diff

Speed up reads, discards and zeroouts through RBD_OBJ_FLAG_MAY_EXIST
and RBD_OBJ_FLAG_NOOP_FOR_NONEXISTENT based on object map.

Invalid object maps are not trusted, but still updated.  Note that we
never iterate, resize or invalidate object maps.  If object-map feature
is enabled but object map fails to load, we just fail the requester
(either "rbd map" or I/O, by way of post-acquire action).
