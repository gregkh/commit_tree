spi: No need to assign dummy value in spi_unregister_controller()

The device_for_each_child() doesn't require the returned value to be checked.
Thus, drop the dummy variable completely and have no warning anymore:

drivers/spi/spi.c: In function ‘spi_unregister_controller’:
drivers/spi/spi.c:2480:6: warning: variable ‘dummy’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  int dummy;
