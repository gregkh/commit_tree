Bluetooth: hci_qca: disable irqs when spinlock is acquired

Looks like Deadlock is observed in hci_qca while performing
stress and stability tests. Since same lock is getting
acquired from qca_wq_awake_rx and hci_ibs_tx_idle_timeout
seeing spinlock recursion, irqs should be disable while
acquiring the spinlock always.
