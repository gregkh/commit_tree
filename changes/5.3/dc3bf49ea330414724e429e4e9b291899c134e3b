treewide: remove SPDX "WITH Linux-syscall-note" from kernel-space headers again

The "WITH Linux-syscall-note" exception exists for headers exported to
user space. It is strange to add it to non-exported headers.

Commit 687a3e4d8e61 ("treewide: remove SPDX "WITH Linux-syscall-note"
from kernel-space headers") did cleanups some months ago, but it looks
like we need to do this periodically.

This patch was generated by the following script:

  git grep -l -e Linux-syscall-note \
    -- :*.h :^arch/*/include/uapi/asm/*.h :^include/uapi/ :^tools |
  while read file
  do
          sed -i -e 's/(\(GPL-[^[:space:]]*\) WITH Linux-syscall-note)/\1/g' \
          -e 's/ WITH Linux-syscall-note//g' $file
  done

I did not commit drivers/staging/android/uapi/ion.h . This header is
not currently exported, but somebody may plan to move it to include/uapi/
when the time comes. I am not sure. Anyway, it will be better to check
the license inconsistency in drivers/staging/android/uapi/.
