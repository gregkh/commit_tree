scsi: ufs: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ufshcd_config_vreg_hpm()

Fix the following BUG:

  [ 187.065689] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 000000000000001c
  [ 187.065790] RIP: 0010:ufshcd_vreg_set_hpm+0x3c/0x110 [ufshcd_core]

Voltage regulators are optional, so functions must check they exist
before dereferencing.

Note this issue is hidden if CONFIG_REGULATORS is not set, because the
offending code is optimised away.

Notes for stable:

The issue first appears in commit 57d104c153d3 ("ufs: add UFS power
management support") but is inadvertently fixed in commit 60f0187031c0
("scsi: ufs: disable vccq if it's not needed by UFS device") which in
turn was reverted by commit 730679817d83 ("Revert "scsi: ufs: disable vccq
if it's not needed by UFS device""). So fix applies v3.18 to v4.5 and
v5.1+
