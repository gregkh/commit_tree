tty: max310x: Simplify tx-work item code

Since cmwq introduction in the kernel, workqueues've been turned into
non-reentrant execution contexts [1]. It means any work item is
guaranteed to be executed by at most one worker system-wide at any
given time. Since tx-handler max310x_handle_tx() is called by a
single work item we don't need it to be self-protected by the mutex.
We also don't need to check the tx work item pending state before
scheduling it (which in the first place was racy btw), since cmwq will
make sure to reschedule the item if it wasn't pending at the moment of
schedule_work() call.
