of/fdt: Mark initial_boot_params as __ro_after_init

The FDT pointer, i.e. initial_boot_params, shouldn't be changed after
init. It's only set by boot code and then the only user of the FDT is
the raw sysfs reading API. Mark this pointer with __ro_after_init so
that the pointer can't be changed after init.
