net: phy: fix race in genphy_update_link

In phy_start_aneg() autoneg is started, and immediately after that
link and autoneg status are read. As reported in [0] it can happen that
at time of this read the PHY has reset the "aneg complete" bit but not
yet the "link up" bit, what can result in a false link-up detection.
To fix this don't report link as up if we're in aneg mode and PHY
doesn't signal "aneg complete".
