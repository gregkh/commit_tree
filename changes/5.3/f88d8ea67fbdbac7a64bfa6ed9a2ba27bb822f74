ipv6: Plumb support for nexthop object in a fib6_info

Add struct nexthop and nh_list list_head to fib6_info. nh_list is the
fib6_info side of the nexthop <-> fib_info relationship. Since a fib6_info
referencing a nexthop object can not have 'sibling' entries (the old way
of doing multipath routes), the nh_list is a union with fib6_siblings.

Add f6i_list list_head to 'struct nexthop' to track fib6_info entries
using a nexthop instance. Update __remove_nexthop_fib to walk f6_list
and delete fib entries using the nexthop.

Add a few nexthop helpers for use when a nexthop is added to fib6_info:
- nexthop_fib6_nh - return first fib6_nh in a nexthop object
- fib6_info_nh_dev moved to nexthop.h and updated to use nexthop_fib6_nh
  if the fib6_info references a nexthop object
- nexthop_path_fib6_result - similar to ipv4, select a path within a
  multipath nexthop object. If the nexthop is a blackhole, set
  fib6_result type to RTN_BLACKHOLE, and set the REJECT flag

Update the fib6_info references to check for nh and take a different path
as needed:
- rt6_qualify_for_ecmp - if a fib entry uses a nexthop object it can NOT
  be coalesced with other fib entries into a multipath route
- rt6_duplicate_nexthop - use nexthop_cmp if either fib6_info references
  a nexthop
- addrconf (host routes), RA's and info entries (anything configured via
  ndisc) does not use nexthop objects
- fib6_info_destroy_rcu - put reference to nexthop object
- fib6_purge_rt - drop fib6_info from f6i_list
- fib6_select_path - update to use the new nexthop_path_fib6_result when
  fib entry uses a nexthop object
- rt6_device_match - update to catch use of nexthop object as a blackhole
  and set fib6_type and flags.
- ip6_route_info_create - don't add space for fib6_nh if fib entry is
  going to reference a nexthop object, take a reference to nexthop object,
  disallow use of source routing
- rt6_nlmsg_size - add space for RTA_NH_ID
- add rt6_fill_node_nexthop to add nexthop data on a dump

As with ipv4, most of the changes push existing code into the else branch
of whether the fib entry uses a nexthop object.

Update the nexthop code to walk f6i_list on a nexthop deleted to remove
fib entries referencing it.
