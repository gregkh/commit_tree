pwm: Add support referencing PWMs from ACPI

In analogy to referencing a GPIO using the "gpios" property from ACPI,
support referencing a PWM using the "pwms" property.

ACPI entries must look like
 Package () {"pwms", Package ()
     { <PWM device reference>, <PWM index>, <PWM period> [, <PWM flags>]}}

In contrast to the DT implementation, only _one_ PWM entry in the "pwms"
property is supported. As a consequence "pwm-names"-property and
con_id lookup aren't supported.

Support for ACPI is added via the firmware-node framework which is an
abstraction layer on top of ACPI/DT. To keep this patch clean, DT and
ACPI paths are kept separate. The firmware-node framework could be used
to unify both paths in a future patch.

To support leds-pwm driver, an additional method devm_fwnode_pwm_get()
which supports both ACPI and DT configuration is exported.
