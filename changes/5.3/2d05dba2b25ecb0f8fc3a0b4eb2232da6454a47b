HID: cp2112: prevent sleeping function called from invalid context

When calling request_threaded_irq() with a CP2112, the function
cp2112_gpio_irq_startup() is called in a IRQ context.

Therefore we can not sleep, and we can not call
cp2112_gpio_direction_input() there.

Move the call to cp2112_gpio_direction_input() earlier to have a working
driver.
