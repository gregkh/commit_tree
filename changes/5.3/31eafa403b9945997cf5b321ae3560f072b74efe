ice: Implement LLDP persistence

Implement LLDP persistence across reboots, start and stop of LLDP agent.
Add additional parameter to ice_aq_start_lldp and ice_aq_stop_lldp.

Also change the ethtool private flag from "disable-fw-lldp" to
"enable-fw-lldp". This change will flip the boolean logic of the
functionality of the flag (on = enable, off = disable). The change
in name and functionality is to differentiate between the
pre-persistence and post-persistence states.
