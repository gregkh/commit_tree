bcache: make bset_search_tree() be more understandable

The purpose of following code in bset_search_tree() is to avoid a branch
instruction,
 994         if (likely(f->exponent != 127))
 995                 n = j * 2 + (((unsigned int)
 996                               (f->mantissa -
 997                                bfloat_mantissa(search, f))) >> 31);
 998         else
 999                 n = (bkey_cmp(tree_to_bkey(t, j), search) > 0)
1000                         ? j * 2
1001                         : j * 2 + 1;

This piece of code is not very clear to understand, even when I tried to
add code comment for it, I made mistake. This patch removes the implict
bit operation and uses explicit branch to calculate next location in
binary tree search.
