powerpc/powernv/npu: Fix reference leak

Since 902bdc57451c, get_pci_dev() calls pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(). This
has the effect of incrementing the reference count of the PCI device, as
explained in drivers/pci/search.c:

 * Given a PCI domain, bus, and slot/function number, the desired PCI
 * device is located in the list of PCI devices. If the device is
 * found, its reference count is increased and this function returns a
 * pointer to its data structure.  The caller must decrement the
 * reference count by calling pci_dev_put().  If no device is found,
 * %NULL is returned.

Nothing was done to call pci_dev_put() and the reference count of GPU and
NPU PCI devices rockets up.

A natural way to fix this would be to teach the callers about the change,
so that they call pci_dev_put() when done with the pointer. This turns
out to be quite intrusive, as it affects many paths in npu-dma.c,
pci-ioda.c and vfio_pci_nvlink2.c. Also, the issue appeared in 4.16 and
some affected code got moved around since then: it would be problematic
to backport the fix to stable releases.

All that code never cared for reference counting anyway. Call pci_dev_put()
from get_pci_dev() to revert to the previous behavior.
