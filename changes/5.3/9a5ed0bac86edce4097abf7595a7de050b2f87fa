regulator: wm831x: Convert to use GPIO descriptors

This converts the Wolfson Micro WM831x DCDC converter to use
a GPIO descriptor for the GPIO driving the DVS pin.

There is just one (non-DT) machine in the kernel using this, and
that is the Wolfson Micro (now Cirrus) Cragganmore 6410 so we
patch this board to pass a descriptor table and fix up the driver
accordingly.
