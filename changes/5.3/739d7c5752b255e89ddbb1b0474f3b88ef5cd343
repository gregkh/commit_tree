nfp: flower: prevent ingress block binds on internal ports

Internal port TC offload is implemented through user-space applications
(such as OvS) by adding filters at egress via TC clsact qdiscs. Indirect
block offload support in the NFP driver accepts both ingress qdisc binds
and egress binds if the device is an internal port. However, clsact sends
bind notification for both ingress and egress block binds which can lead
to the driver registering multiple callbacks and receiving multiple
notifications of new filters.

Fix this by rejecting ingress block bind callbacks when the port is
internal and only adding filter callbacks for egress binds.
