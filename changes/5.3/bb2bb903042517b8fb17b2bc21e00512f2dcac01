dma-buf: add DMA_BUF_SET_NAME ioctls

This patch adds complimentary DMA_BUF_SET_NAME  ioctls, which lets
userspace processes attach a free-form name to each buffer.

This information can be extremely helpful for tracking and accounting
shared buffers.  For example, on Android, we know what each buffer will
be used for at allocation time: GL, multimedia, camera, etc.  The
userspace allocator can use DMA_BUF_SET_NAME to associate that
information with the buffer, so we can later give developers a
breakdown of how much memory they're allocating for graphics, camera,
etc.
