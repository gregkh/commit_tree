smb3: optimize open to not send query file internal info

We can cut one third of the traffic on open by not querying the
inode number explicitly via SMB3 query_info since it is now
returned on open in the qfid context.

This is better in multiple ways, and
speeds up file open about 10% (more if network is slow).
