scsi: NCR5380: Always re-enable reselection interrupt

The reselection interrupt gets disabled during selection and must be
re-enabled when hostdata->connected becomes NULL. If it isn't re-enabled a
disconnected command may time-out or the target may wedge the bus while
trying to reselect the host. This can happen after a command is aborted.

Fix this by enabling the reselection interrupt in NCR5380_main() after
calls to NCR5380_select() and NCR5380_information_transfer() return.
