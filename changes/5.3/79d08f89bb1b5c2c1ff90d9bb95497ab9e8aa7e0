block: fix .bi_size overflow

'bio->bi_iter.bi_size' is 'unsigned int', which at most hold 4G - 1
bytes.

Before 07173c3ec276 ("block: enable multipage bvecs"), one bio can
include very limited pages, and usually at most 256, so the fs bio
size won't be bigger than 1M bytes most of times.

Since we support multi-page bvec, in theory one fs bio really can
be added > 1M pages, especially in case of hugepage, or big writeback
with too many dirty pages. Then there is chance in which .bi_size
is overflowed.

Fixes this issue by using bio_full() to check if the added segment may
overflow .bi_size.
