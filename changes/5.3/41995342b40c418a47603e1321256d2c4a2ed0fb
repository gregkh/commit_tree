s390/dasd: fix endless loop after read unit address configuration

After getting a storage server event that causes the DASD device driver
to update its unit address configuration during a device shutdown there is
the possibility of an endless loop in the device driver.

In the system log there will be ongoing DASD error messages with RC: -19.

The reason is that the loop starting the ruac request only terminates when
the retry counter is decreased to 0. But in the sleep_on function there are
early exit paths that do not decrease the retry counter.

Prevent an endless loop by handling those cases separately.

Remove the unnecessary do..while loop since the sleep_on function takes
care of retries by itself.
