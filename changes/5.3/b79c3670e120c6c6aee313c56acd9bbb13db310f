pwm: meson: Don't duplicate the polarity internally

Let meson_pwm_calc() use the polarity from struct pwm_state directly.
This removes a level of indirection where meson_pwm_apply() first had to
set a driver-internal inverter mask which was then only used by
meson_pwm_calc().

Instead of adding the polarity as parameter to meson_pwm_calc() switch
to struct pwm_state directly to make it easier to see where the
parameters are actually coming from.
