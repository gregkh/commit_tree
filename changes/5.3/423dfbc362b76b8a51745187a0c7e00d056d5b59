HID: logitech-dj: Add usb-id for the 27MHz MX3000 receiver

Testing has shown that, as expected, the MX3000 receiver is fully
compatible with the existing 27MHz receiver support in hid-logitech-dj.c.

After this the only, presumably also compatible, receiver id left in
hid-lg.c is the USB_DEVICE_ID_S510_RECEIVER / 0xc50c id. If we can get
someone to confirm that this receiver works with the dj 27Mhz support too,
then the handling of the LG_RDESC and LG_WIRELESS quirks can be removed
from hid-lg.c.
