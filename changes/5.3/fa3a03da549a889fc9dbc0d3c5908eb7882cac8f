batman-adv: Fix netlink dumping of all mcast_flags buckets

The bucket variable is only updated outside the loop over the mcast_flags
buckets. It will only be updated during a dumping run when the dumping has
to be interrupted and a new message has to be started.

This could result in repeated or missing entries when the multicast flags
are dumped to userspace.
