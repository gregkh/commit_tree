staging: kpc2000: inverted conditional in order to reduce indentation.

Changed:

  for (...) {
    ...
    if (expr) {
      ...
    }
  }

into:

  for (...) {
    ...
    if (!expr)
      continue;
    ...
  }

in order to reduce indentation of conditional block.  Fixed indentation
of cases blocks at the same time.
