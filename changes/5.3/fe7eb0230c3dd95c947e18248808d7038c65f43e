tpm: Append the final event log to the TPM event log

Any events that are logged after GetEventsLog() is called are logged to
the EFI Final Events table. These events are defined as being in the
crypto agile log format, so we can just append them directly to the
existing log if it's in the same format. In theory we can also construct
old-style SHA1 log entries for devices that only return logs in that
format, but EDK2 doesn't generate the final event log in that case so
it doesn't seem worth it at the moment.
