drivers/pps/pps.c: clear offset flags in PPS_SETPARAMS ioctl

The PPS assert/clear offset corrections are set by the PPS_SETPARAMS
ioctl in the pps_ktime structs, which also contain flags.  The flags are
not initialized by applications (using the timepps.h header) and they
are not used by the kernel for anything except returning them back in
the PPS_GETPARAMS ioctl.

Set the flags to zero to make it clear they are unused and avoid leaking
uninitialized data of the PPS_SETPARAMS caller to other applications
that have a read access to the PPS device.
