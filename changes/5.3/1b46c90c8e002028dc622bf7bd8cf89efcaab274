crypto: caam - convert top level drivers to libraries

Currently we allow top level code, i.e. that which sits between the
low level (HW-specific) drivers and crypto API, to be built as several
drivers: caamalg, caamhash, caam_pkc, caamrng, caamalg_qi.

There is no advantage in this, more it interferes with adding support
for deferred probing (there are no corresponding devices and thus
no bus).

Convert these drivers and call init() / exit() manually at the right
time.
Move algorithms initialization at JR probe / remove time:
-the first probed JR registers the crypto algs
-the last removed JR unregisters the crypto algs

Note: caam_qi_init() is called before JR platform devices creation
(of_populate_bus()), such that QI interface is initialized when
the caam/qi algorithms are registered in the JR driver (by calling
caam_qi_algapi_init().

While here, fix the Kconfig entries under CRYPTO_DEV_FSL_CAAM_JR
to be aligned.
