vfs: introduce file_modified() helper

The combination of file_remove_privs() and file_update_mtime() is
quite common in filesystem ->write_iter() methods.

Modelled after the helper file_accessed(), introduce file_modified()
and use it from generic_remap_file_range_prep().

Note that the order of calling file_remove_privs() before
file_update_mtime() in the helper was matched to the more common order by
filesystems and not the current order in generic_remap_file_range_prep().
