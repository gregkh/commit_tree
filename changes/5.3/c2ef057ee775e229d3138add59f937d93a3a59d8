net: aquantia: reapply vlan filters on up

In case of device reconfiguration the driver may reset the device invisible
for other modules, vlan module in particular. So vlans will not be
removed&created and vlan filters will not be configured in the device.
The patch reapplies the vlan filters at device start.
