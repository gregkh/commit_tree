perf tools: Introduce rlimit__bump_memlock() helper

Just like the BPF guys did when faced with failures with map creation,
etc, i.e. their solution is:

  tools/testing/selftests/bpf/bpf_rlimit.h

For perf use this function in 'perf test' and in 'perf trace'.

Make it bump to 4 times the current value, if it fails twice the current
value and if it still fails, warn that things like BPF map creation may
fail, to help in diagnosing the problem.
