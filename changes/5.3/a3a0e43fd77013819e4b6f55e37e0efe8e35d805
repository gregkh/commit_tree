io_uring: don't enter poll loop if we have CQEs pending

We need to check if we have CQEs pending before starting a poll loop,
as those could be the events we will be spinning for (and hence we'll
find none). This can happen if a CQE triggers an error, or if it is
found by eg an IRQ before we get a chance to find it through polling.
