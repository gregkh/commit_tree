nvme-pci: check for NULL return from pci_alloc_p2pmem()

Modify nvme_alloc_sq_cmds() to call pci_free_p2pmem() to free the memory
it allocated using pci_alloc_p2pmem() in case pci_p2pmem_virt_to_bus()
returns null.

Makes sure not to call pci_free_p2pmem() if pci_alloc_p2pmem() returned
NULL, which can happen if CONFIG_PCI_P2PDMA is not configured.

The current implementation is not expected to leak since
pci_p2pmem_virt_to_bus() is expected to fail only if pci_alloc_p2pmem()
returns null. However, checking the return value of pci_alloc_p2pmem()
is more explicit.
