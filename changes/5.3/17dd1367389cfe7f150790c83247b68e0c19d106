vsock/virtio: stop workers during the .remove()

Before to call vdev->config->reset(vdev) we need to be sure that
no one is accessing the device, for this reason, we add new variables
in the struct virtio_vsock to stop the workers during the .remove().

This patch also add few comments before vdev->config->reset(vdev)
and vdev->config->del_vqs(vdev).
