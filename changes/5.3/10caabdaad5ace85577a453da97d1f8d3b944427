net/mlx5e: Use termination table for VLAN push actions

HW does not support push VLAN action in the RX direction (packets
arriving from the wire). The FW works around this limitation by haripining
the packet. The hairpin workaround applies only when the push VLAN action
is specified in a termination table, assuring that there are no actions
following the haripin.

Instantiate termination table for push VLAN actions. Re-use identical
terminating tables for increased HW cache efficiency.
