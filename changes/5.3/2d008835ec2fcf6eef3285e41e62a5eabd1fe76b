f2fs: improve print log in f2fs_sanity_check_ckpt()

As Park Ju Hyung suggested:

"I'd like to suggest to write down an actual version of f2fs-tools
here as we've seen older versions of fsck doing even more damage
and the users might not have the latest f2fs-tools installed."

This patch give a more detailed info of how we fix such corruption
to user to avoid damageable repair with low version fsck.
