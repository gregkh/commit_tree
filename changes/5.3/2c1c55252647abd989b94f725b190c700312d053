drm/i915/dsi: Use a fuzzy check for burst mode clock check

Prior to this commit we fail to init the DSI panel on the GPD MicroPC:
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-micropc-6-inch-handheld-industry-laptop#/

The problem is intel_dsi_vbt_init() failing with the following error:
*ERROR* Burst mode freq is less than computed

The pclk in the VBT panel modeline is 70000, together with 24 bpp and
4 lines this results in a bitrate value of 70000 * 24 / 4 = 420000.
But the target_burst_mode_freq in the VBT is 418000.

This commit works around this problem by adding an intel_fuzzy_clock_check
when target_burst_mode_freq < bitrate and setting target_burst_mode_freq to
bitrate when that checks succeeds, fixing the panel not working.
