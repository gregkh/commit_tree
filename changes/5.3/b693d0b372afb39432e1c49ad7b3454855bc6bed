docs: arm64: convert docs to ReST and rename to .rst

The documentation is in a format that is very close to ReST format.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fixing tables markups;
  - adding some lists markups;
  - marking literal blocks;
  - adjust some title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
