libnvdimm/bus: Fix wait_nvdimm_bus_probe_idle() ABBA deadlock

A multithreaded namespace creation/destruction stress test currently
deadlocks with the following lockup signature:

In this sequence an 'nd_dax' device is being probed and trying to take
the lock on its backing namespace to validate that the 'nd_dax' device
indeed has exclusive access to the backing namespace. Meanwhile, another
thread is trying to update the uuid property of that same backing
namespace. So one thread is in the probe path trying to acquire the
lock, and the other thread has acquired the lock and tries to flush the
probe path.

Fix this deadlock by not holding the namespace device_lock over the
wait_nvdimm_bus_probe_idle() synchronization step. In turn this requires
the device_lock to be held on entry to wait_nvdimm_bus_probe_idle() and
subsequently dropped internally to wait_nvdimm_bus_probe_idle().
