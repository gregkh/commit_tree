coccinelle: api/atomic_as_refcounter: add SPDX License Identifier

Add the missing GPLv2 SPDX license identifier.

It appears this single file was missing from 7f904d7e1f3e ("treewide:
Replace GPLv2 boilerplate/reference with SPDX - rule 505"), which
addressed all other files in scripts/coccinelle. Hence I added
GPL-2.0-only consitently with the mentioned patch.
