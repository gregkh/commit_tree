mm/hmm: Remove confusing comment and logic from hmm_release

hmm_release() is called exactly once per hmm. ops->release() cannot
accidentally trigger any action that would recurse back onto
hmm->mirrors_sem.

This fixes a use after-free race of the form:

       CPU0                                   CPU1
                                           hmm_release()
                                             up_write(&hmm->mirrors_sem);
 hmm_mirror_unregister(mirror)
  down_write(&hmm->mirrors_sem);
  up_write(&hmm->mirrors_sem);
  kfree(mirror)
                                             mirror->ops->release(mirror)

The only user we have today for ops->release is an empty function, so this
is unambiguously safe.

As a consequence of plugging this race drivers are not allowed to
register/unregister mirrors from within a release op.
