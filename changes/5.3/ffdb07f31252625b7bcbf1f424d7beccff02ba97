x86/mm: Free sme_early_buffer after init

The contents of sme_early_buffer should be cleared after
__sme_early_enc_dec() because it is used to move encrypted and decrypted
data, but since __sme_early_enc_dec() is __init this buffer simply can be
freed after init.

This saves a page that is otherwise unreferenced after init.
