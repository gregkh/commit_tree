scsi: lpfc: Fix FDMI fc4type for nvme support

FDMI protocol support registration was not accurately showing nvme
support. The fcponly-path clears the parameter object.

Move the code out of the fcponly code path.  Fix the FDMI registration data
to properly check for nvme support.  Commonize the manner in which the fdmi
routines set protocol support.
