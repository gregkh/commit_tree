eeprom: make older eeprom drivers select NVMEM_SYSFS

misc/eeprom/{at24,at25,eeprom_93xx46} drivers all register their
corresponding devices in the nvmem framework in compat mode which requires
nvmem sysfs interface to be present. The latter, however, has been split
out from nvmem under a separate Kconfig in commit ae0c2d725512 ("nvmem:
core: add NVMEM_SYSFS Kconfig"). As a result, probing certain I2C-attached
EEPROMs now fails with

  at24: probe of 0-0050 failed with error -38

because of a stub implementation of nvmem_sysfs_setup_compat()
in drivers/nvmem/nvmem.h. Update the nvmem dependency for these drivers
so they could load again:

  at24 0-0050: 32768 byte 24c256 EEPROM, writable, 64 bytes/write
