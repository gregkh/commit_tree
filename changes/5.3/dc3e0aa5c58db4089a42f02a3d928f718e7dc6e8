misc: remove redundant 'default n' from Kconfig-s

'default n' is the default value for any bool or tristate Kconfig
setting so there is no need to write it explicitly.

Also since commit f467c5640c29 ("kconfig: only write '# CONFIG_FOO
is not set' for visible symbols") the Kconfig behavior is the same
regardless of 'default n' being present or not:

    ...
    One side effect of (and the main motivation for) this change is making
    the following two definitions behave exactly the same:

        config FOO
                bool

        config FOO
                bool
                default n

    With this change, neither of these will generate a
    '# CONFIG_FOO is not set' line (assuming FOO isn't selected/implied).
    That might make it clearer to people that a bare 'default n' is
    redundant.
