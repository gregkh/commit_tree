keys: Add a keyctl to move a key between keyrings

Add a keyctl to atomically move a link to a key from one keyring to
another.  The key must exist in "from" keyring and a flag can be given to
cause the operation to fail if there's a matching key already in the "to"
keyring.

This can be done with:

	keyctl(KEYCTL_MOVE,
	       key_serial_t key,
	       key_serial_t from_keyring,
	       key_serial_t to_keyring,
	       unsigned int flags);

The key being moved must grant Link permission and both keyrings must grant
Write permission.

flags should be 0 or KEYCTL_MOVE_EXCL, with the latter preventing
displacement of a matching key from the "to" keyring.
