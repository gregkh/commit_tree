ASoC: Intel: Add machine driver for CX2072X on BYT/CHT platforms

This is an implementation of a machine driver needed for Conexant
CX2072X codec on Intel Baytrail and Cherrytrail platforms.  The
current patch is based on the initial work by Pierre-Louis Bossart and
the other Intel machine drivers.

The jack detection support (driven via the standard GPIO) was added on
top of the original work.

Tested with ASUS E200HA laptop.
