ALSA: firewire-lib: calculate the length of packet payload in packet handler

In current packet handler, the length of payload is given as an argument
of callback function, however this value is just required to process
payload of transferred isoc packet, thus just for IR context.

This commit replaces the argument for payload of packet with the
argument of context header. As a result, the length of payload is
computed in packet handler for IR context.
