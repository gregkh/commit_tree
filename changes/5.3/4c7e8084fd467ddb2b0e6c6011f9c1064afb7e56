ipv4: Plumb support for nexthop object in a fib_info

Add 'struct nexthop' and nh_list list_head to fib_info. nh_list is the
fib_info side of the nexthop <-> fib_info relationship.

Add fi_list list_head to 'struct nexthop' to track fib_info entries
using a nexthop instance. Add __remove_nexthop_fib and add it to
__remove_nexthop to walk the new list_head and mark those fib entries
as dead when the nexthop is deleted.

Add a few nexthop helpers for use when a nexthop is added to fib_info:
- nexthop_cmp to determine if 2 nexthops are the same
- nexthop_path_fib_result to select a path for a multipath
  'struct nexthop'
- nexthop_fib_nhc to select a specific fib_nh_common within a
  multipath 'struct nexthop'

Update existing fib_info_nhc to use nexthop_fib_nhc if a fib_info uses
a 'struct nexthop', and mark fib_info_nh as only used for the non-nexthop
case.

Update the fib_info functions to check for fi->nh and take a different
path as needed:
- free_fib_info_rcu - put the nexthop object reference
- fib_release_info - remove the fib_info from the nexthop's fi_list
- nh_comp - use nexthop_cmp when either fib_info references a nexthop
  object
- fib_info_hashfn - use the nexthop id for the hashing vs the oif of
  each fib_nh in a fib_info
- fib_nlmsg_size - add space for the RTA_NH_ID attribute
- fib_create_info - verify nexthop reference can be taken, verify
  nexthop spec is valid for fib entry, and add fib_info to fi_list for
  a nexthop
- fib_select_multipath - use the new nexthop_path_fib_result to select a
  path when nexthop objects are used
- fib_table_lookup - if the 'struct nexthop' is a blackhole nexthop, treat
  it the same as a fib entry using 'blackhole'

The bulk of the changes are in fib_semantics.c and most of that is
moving the existing change_nexthops into an else branch.

Update the nexthop code to walk fi_list on a nexthop deleted to remove
fib entries referencing it.
