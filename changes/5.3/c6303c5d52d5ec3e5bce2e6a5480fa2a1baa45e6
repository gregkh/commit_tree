mmc: sdhci-sprd: Fix the incorrect soft reset operation when runtime resuming

The SD host controller specification defines 3 types software reset:
software reset for data line, software reset for command line and software
reset for all. Software reset for all means this reset affects the entire
Host controller except for the card detection circuit.

In sdhci_runtime_resume_host() we always do a software "reset for all",
which causes the Spreadtrum variant controller to work abnormally after
resuming. To fix the problem, let's do a software reset for the data and
the command part, rather than "for all".

However, as sdhci_runtime_resume() is a common sdhci function and we don't
want to change the behaviour for other variants, let's introduce a new
in-parameter for it. This enables the caller to decide if a "reset for all"
shall be done or not.
