power: avs: smartreflex: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

And even when not checking the return value, no need to cast away the
call to (void), as these functions were never a "must check" type of a
function, so remove that odd cast.
