mm: use down_read_killable for locking mmap_sem in access_remote_vm

This function is used by ptrace and proc files like /proc/pid/cmdline and
/proc/pid/environ.

Access_remote_vm never returns error codes, all errors are ignored and
only size of successfully read data is returned.  So, if current task was
killed we'll simply return 0 (bytes read).

Mmap_sem could be locked for a long time or forever if something goes
wrong.  Using a killable lock permits cleanup of stuck tasks and
simplifies investigation.
