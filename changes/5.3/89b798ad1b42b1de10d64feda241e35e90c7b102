btrfs: Use btrfs_get_io_geometry appropriately

Presently btrfs_map_block is used not only to do everything necessary to
map a bio to the underlying allocation profile but it's also used to
identify how much data could be written based on btrfs' stripe logic
without actually submitting anything. This is achieved by passing NULL
for 'bbio_ret' parameter.

This patch refactors all callers that require just the mapping length
by switching them to using btrfs_io_geometry instead of calling
btrfs_map_block with a special NULL value for 'bbio_ret'. No functional
change.
