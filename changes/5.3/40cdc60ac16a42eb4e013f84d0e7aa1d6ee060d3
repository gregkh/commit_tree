device-dax: Add a 'resource' attribute

device-dax based devices were missing a 'resource' attribute to indicate
the physical address range contributed by the device in question. This
information is desirable to userspace tooling that may want to use the
dax device as system-ram, and wants to selectively hotplug and online
the memory blocks associated with a given device.

Without this, the tooling would have to parse /proc/iomem for the memory
ranges contributed by dax devices, which can be a workaround, but it is
far easier to provide this information in the sysfs hierarchy.
