clk: Add clk_parent entry in debugfs

This allows to easily determine the parent in shell scripts without
parsing more complex files.

Add the clk_parent file for all clks which can have a parent, not just
muxes. This way it can be used to determine the clk tree structure
without parsing more complex files.
