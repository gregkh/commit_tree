xfs: always update params on small allocation

xfs_alloc_ag_vextent_small() doesn't update the output parameters in
the event of an AGFL allocation. Instead, it updates the
xfs_alloc_arg structure directly to complete the allocation.

Update both args and the output params to provide consistent
behavior for future callers.
