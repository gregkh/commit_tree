gfs2: gfs2_walk_metadata fix

It turns out that the current version of gfs2_metadata_walker suffers
from multiple problems that can cause gfs2_hole_size to report an
incorrect size.  This will confuse fiemap as well as lseek with the
SEEK_DATA flag.

Fix that by changing gfs2_hole_walker to compute the metapath to the
first data block after the hole (if any), and compute the hole size
based on that.

Fixes xfstest generic/490.
