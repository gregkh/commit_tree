mm/z3fold.c: fix race between migration and destruction

In z3fold_destroy_pool() we call destroy_workqueue(&pool->compact_wq).
However, we have no guarantee that migration isn't happening in the
background at that time.

Migration directly calls queue_work_on(pool->compact_wq), if destruction
wins that race we are using a destroyed workqueue.
