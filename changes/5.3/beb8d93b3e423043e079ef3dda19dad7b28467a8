KVM: VMX: Fix handling of #MC that occurs during VM-Entry

A previous fix to prevent KVM from consuming stale VMCS state after a
failed VM-Entry inadvertantly blocked KVM's handling of machine checks
that occur during VM-Entry.

Per Intel's SDM, a #MC during VM-Entry is handled in one of three ways,
depending on when the #MC is recognoized.  As it pertains to this bug
fix, the third case explicitly states EXIT_REASON_MCE_DURING_VMENTRY
is handled like any other VM-Exit during VM-Entry, i.e. sets bit 31 to
indicate the VM-Entry failed.

If a machine-check event occurs during a VM entry, one of the following occurs:
 - The machine-check event is handled as if it occurred before the VM entry:
        ...
 - The machine-check event is handled after VM entry completes:
        ...
 - A VM-entry failure occurs as described in Section 26.7. The basic
   exit reason is 41, for "VM-entry failure due to machine-check event".

Explicitly handle EXIT_REASON_MCE_DURING_VMENTRY as a one-off case in
vmx_vcpu_run() instead of binning it into vmx_complete_atomic_exit().
Doing so allows vmx_vcpu_run() to handle VMX_EXIT_REASONS_FAILED_VMENTRY
in a sane fashion and also simplifies vmx_complete_atomic_exit() since
VMCS.VM_EXIT_INTR_INFO is guaranteed to be fresh.
