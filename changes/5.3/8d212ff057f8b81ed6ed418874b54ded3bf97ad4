net/mlx5e: Specifying known origin of packets matching the flow

In vport metadata matching, source port number is replaced by metadata.
While FW has no idea about what it is in the metadata, a syndrome will
happen. Specify a known origin to avoid the syndrome.
However, there is no functional change because ANY_VPORT (0) is filled
in flow_source, the same default value as before, as a pre-step towards
metadata matching for fast path.
There are two other values can be filled in flow_source. When setting
0x1, packet matching this rule is from uplink, while 0x2 is for packet
from other local vports.
