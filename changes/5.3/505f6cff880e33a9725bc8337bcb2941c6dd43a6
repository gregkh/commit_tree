drm/komeda: Remove clock ratio property

Properties are uapi like anything else, with all the usual rules
regarding review, testcases, open source userspace ... Furthermore
driver-private kms properties are highly discouraged, over the past
few years we've realized we need to make a serious effort at better
standardizing this stuff.

From the discussion with Liviu the solution for these here needs
multiple pieces:

- For being able to reliably read the memory clock we need a DT
  property, plus maybe DT override snippets to fix it if it's wrong.

- For exposing plane limitations to userspace there's TEST_ONLY. There
  is a bit a gap in telling userspace better that scaling doesn't work
  due to limits (atm a good strategy is to retry again without scaling
  when adding a plane didn't work the first time around). But that
  needs a more generic solution, not exposing something extremely
  komeda specific.

- If this is needed by validation tools, you can still expose it in
  debugfs. We have an entire nice infrastructure for debug printing of
  kms objects already, see the various atomic_print_state callbacks
  and infrastructure around them.
