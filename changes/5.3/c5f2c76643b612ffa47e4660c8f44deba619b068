KVM: VMX: Shadow VMCS pin controls

Prepare to shadow all major control fields on a per-VMCS basis, which
allows KVM to avoid costly VMWRITEs when switching between vmcs01 and
vmcs02.

Shadowing pin controls also allows a future patch to remove the per-VMCS
'hv_timer_armed' flag, as the shadow copy is a superset of said flag.
