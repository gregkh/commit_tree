drivers/staging/rtl8192u: drop first comment line

As stated in coding-styles.rst multiline comments should be structured in a way,
that the actual comment starts on the second line of the commented portion. E.g:

/*
 * Multiline comments
 * should look like
 * this.
 */

However, there is an exception to files in drivers/net/ and net/, where
multiline comments are prefered to look like this:

/* Mutliline comments for
 * drivers/net/ should look
 * like this.
 */

The comments in this file initially looked like the first example.
But since this file is part of a networking driver and thus should
be moved to drivers/net/ one day, this patch adjusts the comments
such that they are fitting to the style imposed for drivers/net/.
