clk: sunxi-ng: gate: Add macros for referencing local clock parents

With the new clk parenting code, clk_init_data was expanded to include
.parent_hws, for clk drivers to directly reference parents by clk_hw,
and .parent_data, for clk drivers to specify parents using a combination
of device tree clock-names, pointers to struct clk_hw, device tree clocks,
and/or fallback global clock names.

Add four new macros:

  - SUNXI_CCU_GATE_HW, that can take a struct clk_hw pointer, instead
    of a string, as its parent.

  - SUNXI_CCU_GATE_FW that takes a string to match a clock-names entry
    in the device tree to specify the clock parent.

  - SUNXI_CCU_GATE_HWS that takes an array of struct clk_hw * as its
    parent. This allows the array to be shared with other clk
    declarations.

  - SUNXI_CCU_GATE_DATA that takes an array of struct clk_parent_data *
    as its parent. This allows the array to be shared with other clk
    declarations.
