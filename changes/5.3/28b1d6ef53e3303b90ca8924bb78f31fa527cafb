netfilter: nft_hash: fix symhash with modulus one

The rule below doesn't work as the kernel raises -ERANGE.

nft add rule netdev nftlb lb01 ip daddr set \
	symhash mod 1 map { 0 : 192.168.0.10 } fwd to "eth0"

This patch allows to use the symhash modulus with one
element, in the same way that the other types of hashes and
algorithms that uses the modulus parameter.
