drm/komeda: Adds internal bpp computing for arm afbc only format YU08 YU10

The drm_format_info doesn't have any cpp or block_size (both are zero)
information for arm only afbc format YU08/YU10. we need to compute it
by ourselves.

Changes since v1:
1. Removed redundant warning check in komeda_get_afbc_format_bpp();
2. Removed a redundant empty line;
3. Rebased the branch.
