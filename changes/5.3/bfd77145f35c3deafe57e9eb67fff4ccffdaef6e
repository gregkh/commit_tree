Makefile: Convert -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 to just -Wimplicit-fallthrough for clang

A compilation -Wimplicit-fallthrough warning was enabled by commit
a035d552a93b ("Makefile: Globally enable fall-through warning")

Even though clang 10.0.0 does not currently support this warning without
a patch, clang currently does not support a value for this option.

  Link: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39382

The gcc default for this warning is 3 so removing the =3 has no effect
for gcc and enables the warning for patched versions of clang.

Also remove the =3 from an existing use in a parisc Makefile:
arch/parisc/math-emu/Makefile
