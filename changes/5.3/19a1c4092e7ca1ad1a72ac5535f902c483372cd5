fix the struct mount leak in umount_tree()

	We need to drop everything we remove from the tree, whether
mnt_has_parent() is true or not.  Usually the bug manifests as a slow
memory leak (leaked struct mount for initramfs); it becomes much more
visible in mount_subtree() users, such as btrfs.  There we leak
a struct mount for btrfs superblock being mounted, which prevents
fs shutdown on subsequent umount.
