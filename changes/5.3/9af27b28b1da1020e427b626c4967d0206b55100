fs/proc/inode.c: use typeof_member() macro

Don't repeat function signatures twice.

This is a kind-of-precursor for "struct proc_ops".

Note:

	typeof(pde->proc_fops->...) ...;

can't be used because ->proc_fops is "const struct file_operations *".
"const" prevents assignment down the code and it can't be deleted in the
type system.
