mm, debug_pagealloc: use a page type instead of page_ext flag

When debug_pagealloc is enabled, we currently allocate the page_ext
array to mark guard pages with the PAGE_EXT_DEBUG_GUARD flag.  Now that
we have the page_type field in struct page, we can use that instead, as
guard pages are neither PageSlab nor mapped to userspace.  This reduces
memory overhead when debug_pagealloc is enabled and there are no other
features requiring the page_ext array.
