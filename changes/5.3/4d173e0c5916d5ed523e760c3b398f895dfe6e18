drm/i915: extract intel_bios.h functions from i915_drv.h

It used to be handy that we only had a couple of headers, but over time
i915_drv.h has become unwieldy. Extract declarations to a separate
header file corresponding to the implementation module, clarifying the
modularity of the driver.

Ensure the header remains self-contained, and do so with minimal further
includes, using forward declarations as needed.

No functional changes.
