drm/i915: Switch back to an array of logical per-engine HW contexts

We switched to a tree of per-engine HW context to accommodate the
introduction of virtual engines. However, we plan to also support
multiple instances of the same engine within the GEM context, defeating
our use of the engine as a key to looking up the HW context. Just
allocate a logical per-engine instance and always use an index into the
ctx->engines[]. Later on, this ctx->engines[] may be replaced by a user
specified map.

v2: Add for_each_gem_engine() helper to iterator within the engines lock
v3: intel_context_create_request() helper
v4: s/unsigned long/unsigned int/ 4 billion engines is quite enough.
v5: Push iterator locking to caller
