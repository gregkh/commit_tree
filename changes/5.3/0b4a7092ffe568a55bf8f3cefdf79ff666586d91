vhost: fix clang build warning

Clang warns:

  drivers/vhost/vhost.c:2085:5: warning: macro expansion producing
  'defined' has undefined behavior [-Wexpansion-to-defined]
  #if VHOST_ARCH_CAN_ACCEL_UACCESS
      ^
  drivers/vhost/vhost.h:98:38: note: expanded from macro
  'VHOST_ARCH_CAN_ACCEL_UACCESS'
  #define VHOST_ARCH_CAN_ACCEL_UACCESS defined(CONFIG_MMU_NOTIFIER) && \
                                       ^

It's being pedantic for the sake of portability, but the fix is easy
enough.

Rework the definition of VHOST_ARCH_CAN_ACCEL_UACCESS to expand to a constant.
