drm/amdgpu: fix modprobe failure for uvd_4/5/6

For uvd_4/5/6, amdgpu driver will only power on them when
there are jobs assigned to decode/enc rings.uvd_4/5/6 dpm was broken
since amdgpu_dpm_set_powergating_by_smu only covers gfx block.

The change would add more IP block support in amdgpu_dpm_set_powergating_by_smu
For GFX/UVD/VCN/VCE, if the new SMU driver is supported, invoke new
power gate helper function smu_dpm_set_power_gate, otherwise, fallback to
legacy powerplay helper function pp_set_powergating_by_smu. For other IP blocks
always invoke legacy powerplay helper function.
