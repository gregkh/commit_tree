ALSA: firewire-lib: use 8 byte packet header for IT context to separate CIP header from CIP payload

In Linux firewire subsystem, for IT context, some quadlets of isochronous
packet payload can be indicated as a part of packet header to queue to
the context.

This commit uses the packet header to split CIP headers from CIP
payload. As a result, regardless of CIP or non-CIP, context payload
includes data blocks only.
