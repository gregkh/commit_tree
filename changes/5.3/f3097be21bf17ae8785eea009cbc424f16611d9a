net: dsa: sja1105: Add a state machine for RX timestamping

Meta frame reception relies on the hardware keeping its promise that it
will send no other traffic towards the CPU port between a link-local
frame and a meta frame.  Otherwise there is no other way to associate
the meta frame with the link-local frame it's holding a timestamp of.
The receive function is made stateful, and buffers a timestampable frame
until its meta frame arrives, then merges the two, drops the meta and
releases the link-local frame up the stack.
