net: bridge: move default pvid init/deinit to NETDEV_REGISTER/UNREGISTER

Most of the bridge device's vlan init bugs come from the fact that its
default pvid is created at the wrong time, way too early in ndo_init()
before the device is even assigned an ifindex. It introduces a bug when the
bridge's dev_addr is added as fdb during the initial default pvid creation
the notification has ifindex/NDA_MASTER both equal to 0 (see example below)
which really makes no sense for user-space[0] and is wrong.
Usually user-space software would ignore such entries, but they are
actually valid and will eventually have all necessary attributes.
It makes much more sense to send a notification *after* the device has
registered and has a proper ifindex allocated rather than before when
there's a chance that the registration might still fail or to receive
it with ifindex/NDA_MASTER == 0. Note that we can remove the fdb flush
from br_vlan_flush() since that case can no longer happen. At
NETDEV_REGISTER br->default_pvid is always == 1 as it's initialized by
br_vlan_init() before that and at NETDEV_UNREGISTER it can be anything
depending why it was called (if called due to NETDEV_REGISTER error
it'll still be == 1, otherwise it could be any value changed during the
device life time).

For the demonstration below a small change to iproute2 for printing all fdb
notifications is added, because it contained a workaround not to show
entries with ifindex == 0.
Command executed while monitoring: $ ip l add br0 type bridge
Before (both ifindex and master == 0):
$ bridge monitor fdb
36:7e:8a:b3:56:ba dev * vlan 1 master * permanent

After (proper br0 ifindex):
$ bridge monitor fdb
e6:2a:ae:7a:b7:48 dev br0 vlan 1 master br0 permanent

v4: move only the default pvid init/deinit to NETDEV_REGISTER/UNREGISTER
v3: send the correct v2 patch with all changes (stub should return 0)
v2: on error in br_vlan_init set br->vlgrp to NULL and return 0 in
    the br_vlan_bridge_event stub when bridge vlans are disabled
