net: dsa: sja1105: Really fix panic on unregistering PTP clock

The IS_ERR_OR_NULL(priv->clock) check inside
sja1105_ptp_clock_unregister() is preventing cancel_delayed_work_sync
from actually being run.

Additionally, sja1105_ptp_clock_unregister() does not actually get run,
when placed in sja1105_remove(). The DSA switch gets torn down, but the
sja1105 module does not get unregistered. So sja1105_ptp_clock_unregister
needs to be moved to sja1105_teardown, to be symmetrical with
sja1105_ptp_clock_register which is called from the DSA sja1105_setup.

It is strange to fix a "fixes" patch, but the probe failure can only be
seen when the attached PHY does not respond to MDIO (issue which I can't
pinpoint the reason to) and it goes away after I power-cycle the board.
This time the patch was validated on a failing board, and the kernel
panic from the fixed commit's message can no longer be seen.
