drm/i915: Replace pcu_lock with sb_lock

We now have two locks for sideband access. The general one covering
sideband access across all generation, sb_lock, and a specific one
covering sideband access via the punit on vlv/chv. After lifting the
sb_lock around the punit into the callers, the pcu_lock is now redudant
and can be separated from its other use to regulate RPS (essentially
giving RPS a lock all of its own).

v2: Extract a couple of minor bug fixes.
