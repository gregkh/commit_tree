powerpc: fix off by one in max_zone_pfn initialization for ZONE_DMA

25078dc1f74be16b858e914f52cc8f4d03c2271a first introduced an off by
one error in the ZONE_DMA initialization of PPC_BOOK3E_64=y and since
9739ab7eda459f0669ec9807e0d9be5020bab88c the off by one applies to
PPC32=y too. This simply corrects the off by one and should resolve
crashes like below:

[   65.179101] page 0x7fff outside node 0 zone DMA [ 0x0 - 0x7fff ]

Unfortunately in various MM places "max" means a non inclusive end of
range. free_area_init_nodes max_zone_pfn parameter is one case and
MAX_ORDER is another one (unrelated) that comes by memory.
