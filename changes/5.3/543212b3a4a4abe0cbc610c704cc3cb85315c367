ceph: close race between d_name_cmp() and update_dentry_lease()

d_name_cmp() and update_dentry_lease() lock and unlock dentry->d_lock
respectively. Dentry may get renamed between them. The fix is moving
the dentry name compare into update_dentry_lease().

This patch introduce two version of update_dentry_lease(). One version
is for the case that parent inode is locked. It does not need to check
parent/target inode and dentry name. Another version is for the case
that parent inode is not locked. It checks parent/target inode and
dentry name after locking dentry->d_lock.
