coresight: etb10: Do not call smp_processor_id from preemptible

During a perf session we try to allocate buffers on the "node" associated
with the CPU the event is bound to. If it is not bound to a CPU, we
use the current CPU node, using smp_processor_id(). However this is unsafe
in a pre-emptible context and could generate the splats as below :

 BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: perf/2544

Use NUMA_NO_NODE hint instead of using the current node for events
not bound to CPUs.
