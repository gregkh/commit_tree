PCI: tegra: Put PEX CLK & BIAS pads in DPD mode

In Tegra210 AFI design has clamp value for the BIAS pad as 0, which keeps
the bias pad in non power down mode. This is leading to power consumption
of 2 mW in BIAS pad, even if the PCIe partition is powergated. To avoid
unnecessary power consumption, put PEX CLK & BIAS pads in deep power down
mode when PCIe partition is power gated.
