NTB: Introduce functions to calculate multi-port resource index

When using multi-ports each port uses resources (dbs, msgs, mws, etc)
on every other port. Creating a mapping for these resources such that
each port has a corresponding resource on every other port is a bit
tricky.

Introduce the ntb_peer_resource_idx() function for this purpose.
It returns the peer resource number that will correspond with the
local peer index on the remote peer.

Also, introduce ntb_peer_highest_mw_idx() which will use
ntb_peer_resource_idx() but return the MW index starting with the
highest index and working down.
