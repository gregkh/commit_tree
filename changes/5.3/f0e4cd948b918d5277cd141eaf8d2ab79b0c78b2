usb: typec: ucsi: ccg: add runtime pm workaround

Cypress USB Type-C CCGx controller firmware version 3.1.10
(which is being used in many NVIDIA GPU cards) has known issue of
not triggering interrupt when a USB device is hot plugged to runtime
resume the controller. If any GPU card gets latest kernel with runtime
pm support but does not get latest fixed firmware then also it should
continue to work and therefore a workaround is required to check for
any connector change event.

The workaround is that i2c bus driver will call pm_request_resume()
to runtime resume ucsi_ccg driver. CCG driver will call the ISR
for any connector change event for NVIDIA GPU card and only if it has
old CCG firmware with the known issue.
