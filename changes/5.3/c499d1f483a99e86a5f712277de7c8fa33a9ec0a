tools arch kvm: Sync kvm headers with the kernel sources

To pick up the changes from:

  41040cf7c5f0 ("arm64/sve: Fix missing SVE/FPSIMD endianness conversions")
  6ca00dfafda7 ("KVM: x86: Modify struct kvm_nested_state to have explicit fields for data")

None entail changes in tooling.

This silences these tools/perf build warnings:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
