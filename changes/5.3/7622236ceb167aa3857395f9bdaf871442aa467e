perf header: Fix divide by zero error if f_header.attr_size==0

So I have been having lots of trouble with hand-crafted perf.data files
causing segfaults and the like, so I have started fuzzing the perf tool.

First issue found:

If f_header.attr_size is 0 in the perf.data file, then perf will crash
with a divide-by-zero error.

Committer note:

Added a pr_err() to tell the user why the command failed.
