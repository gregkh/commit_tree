riscv: delay: use do_div() instead of __udivdi3()

In preparation for removing __udivdi3() from the RISC-V
architecture-specific files, convert its one user to use do_div().
This avoids breaking the RV32 build after __udivdi3() is removed.

This second version removes the assignment of the remainder to an
unused temporary variable.  Thanks to Nicolas Pitre <nico@fluxnic.net>
for the suggestion.
