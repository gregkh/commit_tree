bpf: fix the check that forwarding is enabled in bpf_ipv6_fib_lookup

The bpf_ipv6_fib_lookup function should return BPF_FIB_LKUP_RET_FWD_DISABLED
when forwarding is disabled for the input device.  However instead of checking
if forwarding is enabled on the input device, it checked the global
net->ipv6.devconf_all->forwarding flag.  Change it to behave as expected.
