iwlwifi: pcie: don't service an interrupt that was masked

Sometimes the register status can include interrupts that
were masked. We can, for example, get the RF-Kill bit set
in the interrupt status register although this interrupt
was masked. Then if we get the ALIVE interrupt (for example)
that was not masked, we need to *not* service the RF-Kill
interrupt.
Fix this in the MSI-X interrupt handler.
