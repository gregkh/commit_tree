ARM: ep93xx: Mark expected switch fall-through

Mark switch cases where we are expecting to fall through.

Fix the following warnings (Building: arm-ep93xx_defconfig arm):

arch/arm/mach-ep93xx/crunch.c: In function 'crunch_do':
arch/arm/mach-ep93xx/crunch.c:46:3: warning: this statement may
fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
      memset(crunch_state, 0, sizeof(*crunch_state));
      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   arch/arm/mach-ep93xx/crunch.c:53:2: note: here
     case THREAD_NOTIFY_EXIT:
     ^~~~

Notice that, in this particular case, the code comment is
modified in accordance with what GCC is expecting to find.
