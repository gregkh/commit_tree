ASoC: nau8825: fix fake interruption when booting

There is no pull-up resistor at IRQ line where it connects from
the codec to SoC. When booting, the signal of IRQ pin will keep low
which makes the SoC invoke the ISR repeatedly because the IRQ is
registered trigger low. It will not stop until the codec sets up
the interruption and pulls the signal high. In the patch,
nau8825 will internally pull the signal to high at booting in case
the fake interrupts happen.
