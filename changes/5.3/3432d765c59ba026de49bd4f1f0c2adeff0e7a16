rcutorture: Halt forward-progress checks at end of run

Once removed, an rcu_torture element can be deferred-freed by a chain
of call_rcu() invocations, with each callback invoking another round of
call_rcu() until either a fixed number of call_rcu() invocations have
been chained or until the test ends.  This means that if the test ends,
some of the rcu_torture elements will be "stranded" partway through the
deferred-free process, which results in false-positive warnings from
rcu_torture_writer() due to lack of forward progress should the test
end just at the end of a stutter interval.

This commit therefore suppresses rcu_torture_writer()'s forward-progress
checks when the test ends in order to avoid these false-positive reports..
