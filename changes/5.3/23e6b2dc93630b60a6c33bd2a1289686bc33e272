net: axienet: Fix casting of pointers to u32

This driver was casting skb pointers to u32 and storing them as such in
the DMA buffer descriptor, which is obviously broken on 64-bit. The area
of the buffer descriptor being used is not accessed by the hardware and
has sufficient room for a 32 or 64-bit pointer, so just store the skb
pointer as such.
