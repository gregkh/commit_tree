s390: enforce CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU

x86 and powerpc (partially) enforce already CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU. On
s390 it is enabled on all distributions by default since ages.
The only exception is our zfcpdump kernel.

However to simplify testing, enforce HOTPLUG_CPU. This was suggested
by Paul McKenney, since his rcutorture test environments for CONFIG_SMP=y
only support HOTPLUG_CPU=y.
