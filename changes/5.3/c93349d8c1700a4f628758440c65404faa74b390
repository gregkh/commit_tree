soc: fsl: add DPAA2 console support

This patch adds DPAA2 MC and AIOP console log support.

The platform driver probes on the "fsl,dpaa2-console" device tree node
which describes the base firmware address needed in order to infer the
start address of both firmware logs: MC and AIOP.
It then exports two misc char devices which can be used to dump
the needed logs.
