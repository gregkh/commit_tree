kprobes: Initialize kprobes at postcore_initcall

Initialize kprobes at postcore_initcall level instead of module_init
since kprobes is not a module, and it depends on only subsystems
initialized in core_initcall.
This will allow ftrace kprobe event to add new events when it is
initializing because ftrace kprobe event is initialized at
later initcall level.
