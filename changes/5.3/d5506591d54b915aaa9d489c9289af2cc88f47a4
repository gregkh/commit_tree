selftests/bpf: add auto-detach test

Add a kselftest to cover bpf auto-detachment functionality.
The test creates a cgroup, associates some resources with it,
attaches a couple of bpf programs and deletes the cgroup.

Then it checks that bpf programs are going away in 5 seconds.

Expected output:
  $ ./test_cgroup_attach
  #override:PASS
  #multi:PASS
  #autodetach:PASS
  test_cgroup_attach:PASS

On a kernel without auto-detaching:
  $ ./test_cgroup_attach
  #override:PASS
  #multi:PASS
  #autodetach:FAIL
  test_cgroup_attach:FAIL
