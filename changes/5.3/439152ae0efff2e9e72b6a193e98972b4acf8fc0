arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Enable audio on Teres-I

The TERES-I has internal speakers (left, right), internal microphone
and a headset combo jack (headphones + mic), "CTIA" (android) pinout.

The headphone and mic detect lines of the A64 are connected properly,
but AFAIK currently unsupported by the driver.
