drm/amd/display: Add back missing hw translate init for DCN1_01

[Why]
DCN_VERSION_1_01 is no longer handled in the dal_hw_translate_init
switch since it was inadvertently dropped in the patch that removed the
unnecessary DCN1_01 guards.

This caused numerous regressions on DCN1_01 when loading the driver.

[How]
Add it back.
