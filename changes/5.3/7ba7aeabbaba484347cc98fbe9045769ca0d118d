net: Don't disable interrupts in napi_alloc_frag()

netdev_alloc_frag() can be used from any context and is used by NAPI
and non-NAPI drivers. Non-NAPI drivers use it in interrupt context
and NAPI drivers use it during initial allocation (->ndo_open() or
->ndo_change_mtu()). Some NAPI drivers share the same function for the
initial allocation and the allocation in their NAPI callback.

The interrupts are disabled in order to ensure locked access from every
context to `netdev_alloc_cache'.

Let netdev_alloc_frag() check if interrupts are disabled. If they are,
use `netdev_alloc_cache' otherwise disable BH and invoke
__napi_alloc_frag() for the allocation. The IRQ check is cheaper
compared to disabling & enabling interrupts and memory allocation with
disabled interrupts does not work on -RT.
