LSM: SafeSetID: fix userns handling in securityfs

Looking at current_cred() in write handlers is bad form, stop doing that.

Also, let's just require that the write is coming from the initial user
namespace. Especially SAFESETID_WHITELIST_FLUSH requires privilege over all
namespaces, and SAFESETID_WHITELIST_ADD should probably require it as well.
