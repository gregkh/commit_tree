x86/mm: Identify the end of the kernel area to be reserved

The memory occupied by the kernel is reserved using memblock_reserve()
in setup_arch(). Currently, the area is from symbols _text to __bss_stop.
Everything after __bss_stop must be specifically reserved otherwise it
is discarded. This is not clearly documented.

Add a new symbol, __end_of_kernel_reserve, that more readily identifies
what is reserved, along with comments that indicate what is reserved,
what is discarded and what needs to be done to prevent a section from
being discarded.
