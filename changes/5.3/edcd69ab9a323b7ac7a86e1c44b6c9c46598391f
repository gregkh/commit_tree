iommu: Add virtio-iommu driver

The virtio IOMMU is a para-virtualized device, allowing to send IOMMU
requests such as map/unmap over virtio transport without emulating page
tables. This implementation handles ATTACH, DETACH, MAP and UNMAP
requests.

The bulk of the code transforms calls coming from the IOMMU API into
corresponding virtio requests. Mappings are kept in an interval tree
instead of page tables. A little more work is required for modular and x86
support, so for the moment the driver depends on CONFIG_VIRTIO=y and
CONFIG_ARM64.
