bpf: Fix ORC unwinding in non-JIT BPF code

Objtool previously ignored ___bpf_prog_run() because it didn't understand
the jump table.  This resulted in the ORC unwinder not being able to unwind
through non-JIT BPF code.

Now that objtool knows how to read jump tables, remove the whitelist and
annotate the jump table so objtool can recognize it.

Also add an additional "const" to the jump table definition to clarify that
the text pointers are constant.  Otherwise GCC sets the section writable
flag and the assembler spits out warnings.
