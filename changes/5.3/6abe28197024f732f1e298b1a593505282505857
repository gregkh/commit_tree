s390: enable detection of kernel version from bzImage

Extend "parmarea" to include an offset of the version string, which is
stored as 8-byte big endian value.

To retrieve version string from bzImage reliably, one should check the
presence of "S390EP" ascii string at 0x10008 (available since v3.2),
then read the version string offset from 0x10428 (which has been 0
since v3.2 up to now). The string is null terminated.

Could be retrieved with the following "file" command magic (requires
file v5.34):
8 string \x02\x00\x00\x18\x60\x00\x00\x50\x02\x00\x00\x68\x60\x00\x00\x50\x40\x40\x40\x40\x40\x40\x40\x40 Linux S390
>0x10008       string          S390EP
>>0x10428      bequad          >0
>>>(0x10428.Q) string          >\0             \b, version %s
