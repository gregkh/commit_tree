livepatch: Remove duplicate warning about missing reliable stacktrace support

WARN_ON_ONCE() could not be called safely under rq lock because
of console deadlock issues. Moreover WARN_ON_ONCE() is superfluous in
klp_check_stack(), because stack_trace_save_tsk_reliable() cannot return
-ENOSYS thanks to klp_have_reliable_stack() check in
klp_try_switch_task().
