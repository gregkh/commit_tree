pinctrl: sh-pfc: Add SH_PFC_PIN_CFG_PULL_UP_DOWN shorthand

It is very common for a pin to support both pull-up and pull-down
functionality.  Hence add a shorthand SH_PFC_PIN_CFG_PULL_UP_DOWN.
This not only reduces typing, but also avoids the need for several line
breaks, and makes many overly long lines shorter, improving
readability.
