coresight: Cleanup coresight_remove_conns

When a device is unregistered, we remove all connection
references to it, by searching the connection records of
all devices in the coresight bus, via coresight_remove_conns.
We could avoid searching if this device doesn't have an input
port (e.g, a source). Also document the purpose of the function.
