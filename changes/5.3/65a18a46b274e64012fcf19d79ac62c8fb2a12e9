ASoC: SOF: topology: pass volume min/max linear value to FW

The driver currently passes the volume ramp type and length
topology tokens to firmware, but the min and max volume are
not set. This patch provides a correction to convert the
information from the topology file and pass the linear volume
min/max value to the firmware to improve transitions.
