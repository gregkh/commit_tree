vmw_balloon: Add memory shrinker

Add a shrinker to the VMware balloon to prevent out-of-memory events.
We reuse the deflate logic for this matter. Deadlocks should not happen,
as no memory allocation is performed while the locks of the
communication (batch/page) and page-list are taken. In the unlikely
event in which the configuration semaphore is taken for write we bail
out and fail gracefully (causing processes to be killed).

Once the shrinker is called, inflation is postponed for few seconds.
The timeout is updated without any lock, but this should not cause any
races, as it is written and read atomically.

This feature is disabled by default, since it might cause performance
degradation.
