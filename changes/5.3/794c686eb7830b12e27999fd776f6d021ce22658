drm/scheduler: Fix job cleanup without timeout handler

After "5918045c4ed4 drm/scheduler: rework job destruction", jobs are
only deleted when the timeout handler is able to be cancelled
successfully.

In case no timeout handler is running (timeout == MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT),
job cleanup would be skipped which may result in memory leaks.

Add the handling for the (timeout == MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT) case in
drm_sched_cleanup_jobs.
