perf intel-pt: Decoder to output CBR changes immediately

The core-to-bus ratio (CBR) provides the CPU frequency. With branches
enabled, the decoder was outputting CBR changes only when there was a
branch. That loses the correct time of the change if the trace is not in
context (e.g. not tracing kernel space). Change to output the CBR change
immediately.
