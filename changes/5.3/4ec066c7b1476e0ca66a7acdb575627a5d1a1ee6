iommu/vt-d: Cleanup get_valid_domain_for_dev()

Previously, get_valid_domain_for_dev() is used to retrieve the
DMA domain which has been attached to the device or allocate one
if no domain has been attached yet. As we have delegated the DMA
domain management to upper layer, this function is used purely to
allocate a private DMA domain if the default domain doesn't work
for ths device. Cleanup the code for readability.
