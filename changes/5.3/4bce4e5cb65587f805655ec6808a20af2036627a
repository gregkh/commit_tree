xsk: Return the whole xdp_desc from xsk_umem_consume_tx

Some drivers want to access the data transmitted in order to implement
acceleration features of the NICs. It is also useful in AF_XDP TX flow.

Change the xsk_umem_consume_tx API to return the whole xdp_desc, that
contains the data pointer, length and DMA address, instead of only the
latter two. Adapt the implementation of i40e and ixgbe to this change.
