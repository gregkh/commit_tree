HID: logitech-hidpp: remove support for the G700 over USB

The G700 suffers from the same issue than the G502:
when plugging it in, the driver tries to contact it but it fails.

This timeout is problematic as it introduce a delay in the boot,
and having only the mouse event node means that the hardware
macros keys can not be relayed to the userspace.
