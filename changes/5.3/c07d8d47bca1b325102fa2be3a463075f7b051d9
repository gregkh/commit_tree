kbuild: show hint if subdir-y/m is used to visit module Makefile

Since commit ff9b45c55b26 ("kbuild: modpost: read modules.order instead
of $(MODVERDIR)/*.mod"), a module is no longer built in the following
pattern:

  [Makefile]
  subdir-y := some-module

  [some-module/Makefile]
  obj-m := some-module.o

You cannot write Makefile this way in upstream because modules.order is
not correctly generated. subdir-y is used to descend to a sub-directory
that builds tools, device trees, etc.

For external modules, the modules order does not matter. So, the
Makefile above was known to work.

I believe the Makefile should be re-written as follows:

  [Makefile]
  obj-m := some-module/

  [some-module/Makefile]
  obj-m := some-module.o

However, people will have no idea if their Makefile suddenly stops
working. In fact, I received questions from multiple people.

Show a warning for a while if obj-m is specified in a Makefile visited
by subdir-y or subdir-m.

I touched the %/ rule to avoid false-positive warnings for the single
target.
