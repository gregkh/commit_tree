can: peak_usb: fix potential double kfree_skb()

When closing the CAN device while tx skbs are inflight, echo skb could
be released twice. By calling close_candev() before unlinking all
pending tx urbs, then the internal echo_skb[] array is fully and
correctly cleared before the USB write callback and, therefore,
can_get_echo_skb() are called, for each aborted URB.
