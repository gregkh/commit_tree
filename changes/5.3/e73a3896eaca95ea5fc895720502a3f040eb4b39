mmc: sdhci-cadence: enable v4_mode to fix ADMA 64-bit addressing

The IP datasheet says this controller is compatible with SD Host
Specification Version v4.00.

As it turned out, the ADMA of this IP does not work with 64-bit mode
when it is in the Version 3.00 compatible mode; it understands the
old 64-bit descriptor table (as defined in SDHCI v2), but the ADMA
System Address Register (SDHCI_ADMA_ADDRESS) cannot point to the
64-bit address.

I noticed this issue only after commit bd2e75633c80 ("dma-contiguous:
use fallback alloc_pages for single pages"). Prior to that commit,
dma_set_mask_and_coherent() returned the dma address that fits in
32-bit range, at least for the default arm64 configuration
(arch/arm64/configs/defconfig). Now the host->adma_addr exceeds the
32-bit limit, causing the real problem for the Socionext SoCs.
(As a side-note, I was also able to reproduce the issue for older
kernels by turning off CONFIG_DMA_CMA.)

Call sdhci_enable_v4_mode() to fix this.
