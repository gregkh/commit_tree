ASoC: hdmi-codec: remove reference to the current substream

If the hdmi-codec is on a codec-to-codec link, the substream pointer
it receives is completely made up by snd_soc_dai_link_event().
The pointer will be different between startup() and shutdown().

The hdmi-codec complains when this happens even if it is not really a
problem. The current_substream pointer is not used for anything useful
apart from getting the exclusive ownership of the device.

Remove current_substream pointer and replace the exclusive locking
mechanism with a simple variable and some atomic operations.
