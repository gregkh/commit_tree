dmaengine: ste_dma40: fix unneeded variable warning

clang-9 points out that there are two variables that depending on the
configuration may only be used in an ARRAY_SIZE() expression but not
referenced:

drivers/dma/ste_dma40.c:145:12: error: variable 'd40_backup_regs' is not needed and will not be emitted [-Werror,-Wunneeded-internal-declaration]
static u32 d40_backup_regs[] = {
           ^
drivers/dma/ste_dma40.c:214:12: error: variable 'd40_backup_regs_chan' is not needed and will not be emitted [-Werror,-Wunneeded-internal-declaration]
static u32 d40_backup_regs_chan[] = {

Mark these __maybe_unused to shut up the warning.
