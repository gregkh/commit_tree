ARM: dts: rockchip: Configure BT_DEV_WAKE in on rk3288-veyron

This is the other half of the hacky solution from commit f497ab6b4bb8
("ARM: dts: rockchip: Configure BT_HOST_WAKE as wake-up signal on
veyron").  Specifically the LPM driver that the Broadcom Bluetooth
expects to have (but is missing in mainline) has two halves of the
equation: BT_HOST_WAKE and BT_DEV_WAKE.  The BT_HOST_WAKE (which was
handled in the previous commit) is the one that lets the Bluetooth
wake the system up.  The BT_DEV_WAKE (this patch) tells the Bluetooth
that it's OK to go into a low power mode.  That means we were burning
a bit of extra power in S3 without this patch.  Measurements are a bit
noisy, but it appears to be a few mA worth of difference.

NOTE: Though these pins don't do much on systems with Marvell
Bluetooth, downstream kernels set it on all veyron boards so we'll do
the same.
