Revert "ARM: dts: rockchip: set PWM delay backlight settings for Minnie"

This reverts commit 288ceb85b505c19abe1895df068dda5ed20cf482.

The commit assumes that the minnie panel is a AUO B101EAN01.1 (LVDS
interface), however it is a AUO B101EAN01.8 (eDP interface). The eDP
panel doesn't need the 200 ms delay.
