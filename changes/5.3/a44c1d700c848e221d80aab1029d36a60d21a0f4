ARM: riscpc: replace gettimeoffset() with clocksource

Replace the old gettimeoffset() interface (which became buggy in
several ways) with a clocksource that atomically reads the count
and status from the timer, and corrects the count as appropriate
ensuring proper resolution of time without time warping backwards.

We keep the original periodic timer non-clock event implementation
to provide the kernel with a regular source of interrupts, which
are required to keep the clocksource properly updated.
