media: st-mipid02: add support of V4L2_CID_LINK_FREQ

Ask device connected on sink pad for link frequency
in order to configure CLK_LANE_REG1 (ui_x4).
If not available, ask for pixel rate information to compute it.

This is needed to deal with compressed format such as JPEG
where number of bits per pixel is unknown: computation of
link frequency from pixel rate is not possible.
