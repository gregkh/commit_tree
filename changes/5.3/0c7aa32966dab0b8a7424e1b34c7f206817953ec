media: marvell-ccic: fix DMA s/g desc number calculation

The commit d790b7eda953 ("[media] vb2-dma-sg: move dma_(un)map_sg here")
left dma_desc_nent unset. It previously contained the number of DMA
descriptors as returned from dma_map_sg().

We can now (since the commit referred to above) obtain the same value from
the sg_table and drop dma_desc_nent altogether.

Tested on OLPC XO-1.75 machine. Doesn't affect the OLPC XO-1's Cafe
driver, since that one doesn't do DMA.
