ipv6: Stop sending in-kernel notifications for each nexthop

Both listeners - mlxsw and netdevsim - of IPv6 FIB notifications are now
ready to handle IPv6 multipath notifications.

Therefore, stop ignoring such notifications in both drivers and stop
sending notification for each added / deleted nexthop.

v2:
* Remove 'multipath_rt' from 'struct fib6_entry_notifier_info'
