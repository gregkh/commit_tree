drivers/usb/typec/tps6598x.c: fix 4CC cmd write

Writing 4CC commands with tps6598x_write_4cc() already has
a pointer arg, don't reference it when using as arg to
tps6598x_block_write(). Correcting this enforces the constness
of the pointer to propagate to tps6598x_block_write(), so add
the const qualifier there to avoid the warning.
