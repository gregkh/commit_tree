net: hns3: stop schedule reset service while unloading driver

When unloading driver, the reset task should not be scheduled
anymore. If disable IRQ before cancel ongoing reset task,
the IRQ may be re-enabled by the reset task.

This patch uses HCLGE_STATE_REMOVING/HCLGEVF_STATE_REMOVING
flag to indicate that the driver is unloading, and we should
stop new coming reset service to be scheduled, otherwise,
reset service will access some resource which has been freed
by unloading.
