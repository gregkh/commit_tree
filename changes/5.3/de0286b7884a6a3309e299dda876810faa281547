KVM: nVMX: Preserve last USE_MSR_BITMAPS when preparing vmcs02

KVM dynamically toggles the CPU_BASED_USE_MSR_BITMAPS execution control
for nested guests based on whether or not both L0 and L1 want to pass
through the same MSRs to L2.  Preserve the last used value from vmcs02
so as to avoid multiple VMWRITEs to (re)set/(re)clear the bit on nested
VM-Entry.
