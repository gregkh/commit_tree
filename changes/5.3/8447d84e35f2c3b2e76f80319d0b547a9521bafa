dt-bindings: virtio-mmio: Add IOMMU description

The nature of a virtio-mmio node is discovered by the virtio driver at
probe time. However the DMA relation between devices must be described
statically. When a virtio-mmio node is a virtio-iommu device, it needs an
"#iommu-cells" property as specified by bindings/iommu/iommu.txt.

Otherwise, the virtio-mmio device may perform DMA through an IOMMU, which
requires an "iommus" property. Describe these requirements in the
device-tree bindings documentation.
