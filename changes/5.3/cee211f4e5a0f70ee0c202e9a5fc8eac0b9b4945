iio: amplifiers: ad8366: Add support for the ADA4961 DGA

This change adds support for the ADA4961 BiCMOS RF Digital Gain Amplifier,
(DGA), which is optimized for driving heavy loads out 2.0 GHz and beyond.
The device typically achieves -90 dBc IMD3 performance at 500 MHz and
-85  dBc at 1.5 GHz.

This change re-uses the existing ad8366 driver, as most logic is similar.
Also, this chip has a reset pin which is initialized during probe.
