ARM: defconfig: samsung: Cleanup with savedefconfig

Run savedefconfig to cleanup and reorganize the configs.  Most entries
are only moved around and few options disappear because of defaults.

However this removes the already disabled OSS Emulation and OSS
Sequencer API (SND_MIXER_OSS, SND_PCM_OSS, SND_SEQUENCER_OSS).  These
were already disabled (hidden by missing SND_OSSEMUL and SND_SEQUENCER)
and are not strictly hardware related, therefore they are not necessary
for providing reference hardware config.
