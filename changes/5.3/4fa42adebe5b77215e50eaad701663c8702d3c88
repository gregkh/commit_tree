ath10k: enabling tx stats support over pktlog

For QCA988X target, pktlog gives details of the tx bitrate
which is used in the driver for station info.

Enabling pktlog by default will cause more interrupts
in target to host CE pipe, which can impact more CPU usage
for targets ex:WCN3990 and also not required for all other
platforms (eg: WCN3990), for getting tx bitrate.

Enable pktlog only for QCA988X based on hardware params.

Tested HW : WCN3990
Tested FW : WLAN.HL.3.1-00784-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1
