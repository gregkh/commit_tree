clk: tegra: Do not enable PLL_RE_VCO on Tegra210

It turns out that this PLL is not used on Tegra210, so there's no need
to enable it via the init table. Remove the init table entry for this
PLL to avoid it getting enabled at boot time. If the bootloader enabled
it and forgot to turn it off, the common clock framework will now know
to disable it because it is unused.
