KVM: x86: hyper-v: don't crash on KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID when kvm_intel.nested is disabled

If kvm_intel is loaded with nested=0 parameter an attempt to perform
KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID results in OOPS as nested_get_evmcs_version hook
in kvm_x86_ops is NULL (we assign it in nested_vmx_hardware_setup() and
this only happens in case nested is enabled).

Check that kvm_x86_ops->nested_get_evmcs_version is not NULL before
calling it. With this, we can remove the stub from svm as it is no
longer needed.
