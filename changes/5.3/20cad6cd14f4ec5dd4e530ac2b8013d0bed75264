drm/msm/dpu: Integrate interconnect API in MDSS

The interconnect framework is designed to provide a
standard kernel interface to control the settings of
the interconnects on a SoC.

The interconnect API uses a consumer/provider-based model,
where the providers are the interconnect buses and the
consumers could be various drivers.

MDSS is one of the interconnect consumers which uses the
interconnect APIs to get the path between endpoints and
set its bandwidth requirement for the given interconnected
path.

Changes in v2:
	- Remove error log and unnecessary check (Jordan Crouse)

Changes in v3:
	- Code clean involving variable name change, removal
	  of extra paranthesis and variables (Matthias Kaehlcke)

Changes in v4:
	- Add comments, spacings, tabs, proper port name
	  and icc macro (Georgi Djakov)

Changes in v5:
	- Commit text and parenthesis alignment (Georgi Djakov)

Changes in v6:
	- Change to new icc_set API's (Doug Anderson)

Changes in v7:
	- Fixed a typo

Changes in v8:
	- Handle the of_icc_get() returning NULL case.  In practice
	  icc_set_bw() will gracefully handle the case of a NULL path,
	  but it's probably best for clarity to keep num_paths=0 in
	  this case.
