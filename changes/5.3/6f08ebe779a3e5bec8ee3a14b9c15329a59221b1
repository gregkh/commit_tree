drm/i915: Remove the unneeded AUX power ref from intel_dp_hpd_pulse()

The power get/put was added in

to account for the HW access in ibx_digital_port_connected(). This
latter call was in turn removed in

commit 7d23e3c37bb3 ("drm/i915: Cleaning up intel_dp_hpd_pulse")

after which we didn't actually need the power reference.

One way we are accessing the HW during HPD pulse handling is via DP AUX
transfers, but the transfer function takes its own reference, so doesn't
need the reference in intel_dp_hpd_pulse().

The other spot is in

	intel_psr_short_pulse()->intel_psr_disable_locked()

but that can only happen when the panel is enabled with the
corresponding modeset already holding the required power reference.

v2:
- Remove the unneeded power get/put from intel_psr_disable_locked().

- Checkpatch commit quoting format fix in the commit log.
