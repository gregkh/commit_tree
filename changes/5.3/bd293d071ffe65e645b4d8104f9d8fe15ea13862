dm bufio: fix deadlock with loop device

When thin-volume is built on loop device, if available memory is low,
the following deadlock can be triggered:

One process P1 allocates memory with GFP_FS flag, direct alloc fails,
memory reclaim invokes memory shrinker in dm_bufio, dm_bufio_shrink_scan()
runs, mutex dm_bufio_client->lock is acquired, then P1 waits for dm_buffer
IO to complete in __try_evict_buffer().

But this IO may never complete if issued to an underlying loop device
that forwards it using direct-IO, which allocates memory using
GFP_KERNEL (see: do_blockdev_direct_IO()).  If allocation fails, memory
reclaim will invoke memory shrinker in dm_bufio, dm_bufio_shrink_scan()
will be invoked, and since the mutex is already held by P1 the loop
thread will hang, and IO will never complete.  Resulting in ABBA
deadlock.
