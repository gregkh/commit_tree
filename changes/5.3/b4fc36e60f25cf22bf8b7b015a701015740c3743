powerpc/dma: Fix invalid DMA mmap behavior

The refactor of powerpc DMA functions in commit 6666cc17d780
("powerpc/dma: remove dma_nommu_mmap_coherent") incorrectly
changes the way DMA mappings are handled on powerpc.
Since this change, all mapped pages are marked as cache-inhibited
through the default implementation of arch_dma_mmap_pgprot.
This differs from the previous behavior of only marking pages
in noncoherent mappings as cache-inhibited and has resulted in
sporadic system crashes in certain hardware configurations and
workloads (see Bugzilla).

This commit restores the previous correct behavior by providing
an implementation of arch_dma_mmap_pgprot that only marks
pages in noncoherent mappings as cache-inhibited. As this behavior
should be universal for all powerpc platforms a new file,
dma-generic.c, was created to store it.
