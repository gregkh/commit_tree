pkt_sched: Include const.h

Commit 9903c8dc7342 changed TC_ETF defines to use _BITUL instead of BIT
but did not add the dependecy on linux/const.h. As a consequence,
importing the uapi headers into iproute2 causes builds to fail. Add
the dependency.

Fixes: 9903c8dc7342 ("etf: Don't use BIT() in UAPI headers.")
