drivers/perf: imx_ddr: Add DDR performance counter support to perf

Add DDR performance monitor support for iMX8QXP. The PMU consists of 3
programmable event counters and a single dedicated cycle counter.

Example usage:

 $ perf stat -a -e \
   imx8_ddr0/read-cycles/,imx8_ddr0/write-cycles/,imx8_ddr0/precharge/ ls

- or -

 $ perf stat -a -e \
   imx8_ddr0/cycles/,imx8_ddr0/read-access/,imx8_ddr0/write-access/ ls

Other events are supported, and advertised via perf list.
