coresight: Make the coresight_device_fwnode_match declaration's fwnode parameter const

Fix Linus' merge error in the parent commit, causing:

  drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight.c:1051:11: error: incompatible pointer types passing 'int (struct device *, void *)' to parameter of type 'int (*)(struct device *, const void *)' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
                                        coresight_device_fwnode_match);
                                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  include/linux/device.h:173:17: note: passing argument to parameter 'match' here
                                 int (*match)(struct device *dev, const void *data));
                                       ^

due to missed header file fixup.

[ Greg even sent this patch with his pull request, but I stupidly
  thought it was the merge resolution fix I had already done as part of
  the merge. But no, this was the extra fix for the header file
  that goes with the definition I _had_ caught   - Linus ]
