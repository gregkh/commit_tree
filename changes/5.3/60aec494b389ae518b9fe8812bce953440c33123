ALSA: fireface: support allocate_resources operation in latter protocol

This commit is a part of preparation to perform allocation/release
of isochronous channels in pcm.hw_params/hw_free callbacks.

This commit implements allocate_resources callback for the protocol
specific to latter models. The encoded values of constant table is
split into several condition statements to separate the operation
to configure sampling transfer frequency from the operation to
configure the number of data channels in rx packet.
