scsi: mpt3sas: Affinity high iops queues IRQs to local node

High iops queues are mapped to non-managed irqs. Set affinity of
non-managed irqs to local numa node.  Low latency queues are mapped to
managed irqs.

Driver reserves some reply queues for max iops (through
pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity and .pre_vectors interface). The rest of
queues are for low latency.

Based on io workload in io submission path, driver will decide which group
of reply queues (either high iops queues or low latency queues) to be
used. High iops queues will be mapped to local numa node of controller and
low latency queues will be mapped to cpus across numa nodes. In general,
high iops and low latency queues should fit into 128 reply queues
which is the max number of reply queues supported by Aero/Sea.
