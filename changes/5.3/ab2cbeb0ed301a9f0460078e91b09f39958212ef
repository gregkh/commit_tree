iommu/dma: Handle SG length overflow better

Since scatterlist dimensions are all unsigned ints, in the relatively
rare cases where a device's max_segment_size is set to UINT_MAX, then
the "cur_len + s_length <= max_len" check in __finalise_sg() will always
return true. As a result, the corner case of such a device mapping an
excessively large scatterlist which is mergeable to or beyond a total
length of 4GB can lead to overflow and a bogus truncated dma_length in
the resulting segment.

As we already assume that any single segment must be no longer than
max_len to begin with, this can easily be addressed by reshuffling the
comparison.
