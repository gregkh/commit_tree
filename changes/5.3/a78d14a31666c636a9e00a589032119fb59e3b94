xen: avoid link error on ARM

Building the privcmd code as a loadable module on ARM, we get
a link error due to the private cache management functions:

ERROR: "__sync_icache_dcache" [drivers/xen/xen-privcmd.ko] undefined!

Move the code into a new that is always built in when Xen is enabled,
as suggested by Juergen Gross and Boris Ostrovsky.
