hinic: reduce rss_init stack usage

On 32-bit architectures, putting an array of 256 u32 values on the
stack uses more space than the warning limit:

drivers/net/ethernet/huawei/hinic/hinic_main.c: In function 'hinic_rss_init':
drivers/net/ethernet/huawei/hinic/hinic_main.c:286:1: error: the frame size of 1068 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

I considered changing the code to use u8 values here, since that's
all the hardware supports, but dynamically allocating the array is
a more isolated fix here.
