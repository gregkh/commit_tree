net: sched: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in dequeue_func()

In dequeue_func(), there is an if statement on line 74 to check whether
skb is NULL:
    if (skb)

When skb is NULL, it is used on line 77:
    prefetch(&skb->end);

Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.

To fix this bug, skb->end is used when skb is not NULL.

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.
