arm64/mm: fix variable 'pud' set but not used

GCC throws a warning,

arch/arm64/mm/mmu.c: In function 'pud_free_pmd_page':
arch/arm64/mm/mmu.c:1033:8: warning: variable 'pud' set but not used
[-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  pud_t pud;
        ^~~

because pud_table() is a macro and compiled away. Fix it by making it a
static inline function and for pud_sect() as well.
