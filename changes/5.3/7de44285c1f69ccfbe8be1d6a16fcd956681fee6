net: axienet: Fix race condition causing TX hang

It is possible that the interrupt handler fires and frees up space in
the TX ring in between checking for sufficient TX ring space and
stopping the TX queue in axienet_start_xmit. If this happens, the
queue wake from the interrupt handler will occur before the queue is
stopped, causing a lost wakeup and the adapter's transmit hanging.

To avoid this, after stopping the queue, check again whether there is
sufficient space in the TX ring. If so, wake up the queue again.
