drm/amd/display: fix DMCU hang when going into Modern Standby

[why]
When the system is going into suspend, set_backlight gets called
after the eDP got blanked. Since smooth brightness is enabled,
the driver will make a call into the DMCU to ramp the brightness.
The DMCU would try to enable ABM to do so. But since the display is
blanked, this ends up causing ABM1_ACE_DBUF_REG_UPDATE_PENDING to
get stuck at 1, which results in a dead lock in the DMCU firmware.

[how]
Disable brightness ramping when the eDP display is blanked.
