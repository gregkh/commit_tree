powerpc/pseries/dma: Allow SWIOTLB

The commit 8617a5c5bc00 ("powerpc/dma: handle iommu bypass in
dma_iommu_ops") merged direct DMA ops into the IOMMU DMA ops allowing
SWIOTLB as well but only for mapping; the unmapping and bouncing parts
were left unmodified.

This adds missing direct unmapping calls to .unmap_page() and
.unmap_sg().

This adds missing sync callbacks and directs them to the direct DMA
hooks.
