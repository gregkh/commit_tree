objtool: Track original function across branches

If 'insn->func' is NULL, objtool skips some important checks, including
sibling call validation.  So if some .fixup code does an invalid sibling
call, objtool ignores it.

Treat all code branches (including alts) as part of the original
function by keeping track of the original func value from
validate_functions().

This improves the usefulness of some clang function fallthrough
warnings, and exposes some additional kernel bugs in the process.
