drm/amd/display: Always allocate initial connector state state

[Why]
Unlike our regular connectors, MST connectors don't start off with
an initial connector state. This causes a NULL pointer dereference to
occur when attaching the bpc property since it tries to modify the
connector state.

We need an initial connector state on the connector to avoid the crash.

[How]
Use our reset helper to allocate an initial state and reset the values
to their defaults. We were already doing this before, just not for
MST connectors.
