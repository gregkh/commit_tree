nexthops: Add ipv6 helper to walk all fib6_nh in a nexthop struct

IPv6 has traditionally had a single fib6_nh per fib6_info. With
nexthops we can have multiple fib6_nh associated with a fib6_info.
Add a nexthop helper to invoke a callback for each fib6_nh in a
'struct nexthop'. If the callback returns non-0, the loop is
stopped and the return value passed to the caller.
