ASoC: qcom: common: Fix NULL pointer in of parser

A snd_soc_dai_link_component is allocated and associated with the first
link, so when the code tries to assign the of_node of the second link's
"cpu" member it dereferences a NULL pointer.

Fix this by moving the allocation and assignement of
snd_soc_dai_link_components into the loop, giving us one pair per link.
