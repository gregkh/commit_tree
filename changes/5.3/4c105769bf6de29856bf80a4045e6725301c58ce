pinctrl: aspeed: Strip moved macros and structs from private header

Further cleanup from the SPDX fixup fallout for the recent ASPEED
series. aspeed_g4_defconfig, aspeed_g5_defconfig and multi_v5_defconfig
now compile. Smoke tested the g4 and g5 kernels under QEMU's
palmetto-bmc and romulus-bmc machines respectively.
