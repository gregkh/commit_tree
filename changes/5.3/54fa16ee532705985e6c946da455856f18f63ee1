dm thin metadata: check if in fail_io mode when setting needs_check

Check if in fail_io mode at start of dm_pool_metadata_set_needs_check().
Otherwise dm_pool_metadata_set_needs_check()'s superblock_lock() can
crash in dm_bm_write_lock() while accessing the block manager object
that was previously destroyed as part of a failed
dm_pool_abort_metadata() that ultimately set fail_io to begin with.

Also, update DMERR() message to more accurately describe
superblock_lock() failure.
