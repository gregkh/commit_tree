netfilter: Update obsolete comments referring to ip_conntrack

In 9fb9cbb1082d ("[NETFILTER]: Add nf_conntrack subsystem.") the new
generic nf_conntrack was introduced, and it came to supersede the old
ip_conntrack.

This change updates (some) of the obsolete comments referring to old
file/function names of the ip_conntrack mechanism, as well as removes a
few self-referencing comments that we shouldn't maintain anymore.

I did not update any comments referring to historical actions (e.g,
comments like "this file was derived from ..." were left untouched, even
if the referenced file is no longer here).
