tracing/probe: Add ustring type for user-space string

Add "ustring" type for fetching user-space string from kprobe event.
User can specify ustring type at uprobe event, and it is same as
"string" for uprobe.

Note that probe-event provides this option but it doesn't choose the
correct type automatically since we have not way to decide the address
is in user-space or not on some arch (and on some other arch, you can
fetch the string by "string" type). So user must carefully check the
target code (e.g. if you see __user on the target variable) and
use this new type.
