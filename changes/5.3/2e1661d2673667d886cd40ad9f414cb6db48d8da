signal: Remove the task parameter from force_sig_fault

As synchronous exceptions really only make sense against the current
task (otherwise how are you synchronous) remove the task parameter
from from force_sig_fault to make it explicit that is what is going
on.

The two known exceptions that deliver a synchronous exception to a
stopped ptraced task have already been changed to
force_sig_fault_to_task.

The callers have been changed with the following emacs regular expression
(with obvious variations on the architectures that take more arguments)
to avoid typos:

force_sig_fault[(]\([^,]+\)[,]\([^,]+\)[,]\([^,]+\)[,]\W+current[)]
->
force_sig_fault(\1,\2,\3)
