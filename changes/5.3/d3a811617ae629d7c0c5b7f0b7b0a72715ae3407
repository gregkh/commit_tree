lib/test_meminit.c: fix -Wmaybe-uninitialized false positive

The conditional logic is too complicated for the compiler to fully
comprehend:

  lib/test_meminit.c: In function 'test_meminit_init':
  lib/test_meminit.c:236:5: error: 'buf_copy' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
       kfree(buf_copy);
       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  lib/test_meminit.c:201:14: note: 'buf_copy' was declared here

Simplify it by splitting out the non-rcu section.
