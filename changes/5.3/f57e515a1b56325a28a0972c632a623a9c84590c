kernel/pid.c: convert struct pid count to refcount_t

struct pid's count is an atomic_t field used as a refcount.  Use
refcount_t for it which is basically atomic_t but does additional
checking to prevent use-after-free bugs.

For memory ordering, the only change is with the following:

 -	if ((atomic_read(&pid->count) == 1) ||
 -	     atomic_dec_and_test(&pid->count)) {
 +	if (refcount_dec_and_test(&pid->count)) {
 		kmem_cache_free(ns->pid_cachep, pid);

Here the change is from: Fully ordered --> RELEASE + ACQUIRE (as per
refcount-vs-atomic.rst) This ACQUIRE should take care of making sure the
free happens after the refcount_dec_and_test().

The above hunk also removes atomic_read() since it is not needed for the
code to work and it is unclear how beneficial it is.  The removal lets
refcount_dec_and_test() check for cases where get_pid() happened before
the object was freed.
