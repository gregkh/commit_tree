mm: workingset: fix vmstat counters for shadow nodes

Memcg counters for shadow nodes are broken because the memcg pointer is
obtained in a wrong way. The following approach is used:
        virt_to_page(xa_node)->mem_cgroup

Since commit 4d96ba353075 ("mm: memcg/slab: stop setting
page->mem_cgroup pointer for slab pages") page->mem_cgroup pointer isn't
set for slab pages, so memcg_from_slab_page() should be used instead.

Also I doubt that it ever worked correctly: virt_to_head_page() should
be used instead of virt_to_page().  Otherwise objects residing on tail
pages are not accounted, because only the head page contains a valid
mem_cgroup pointer.  That was a case since the introduction of these
counters by the commit 68d48e6a2df5 ("mm: workingset: add vmstat counter
for shadow nodes").
