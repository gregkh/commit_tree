ALSA: hda - Let all conexant codec enter D3 when rebooting

We have 3 new lenovo laptops which have conexant codec 0x14f11f86,
these 3 laptops also have the noise issue when rebooting, after
letting the codec enter D3 before rebooting or poweroff, the noise
disappers.

Instead of adding a new ID again in the reboot_notify(), let us make
this function apply to all conexant codec. In theory make codec enter
D3 before rebooting or poweroff is harmless, and I tested this change
on a couple of other Lenovo laptops which have different conexant
codecs, there is no side effect so far.
