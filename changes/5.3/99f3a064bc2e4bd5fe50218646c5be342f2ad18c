bpf: net: Add SO_DETACH_REUSEPORT_BPF

There is SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_[CE]BPF but there is no DETACH.
This patch adds SO_DETACH_REUSEPORT_BPF sockopt.  The same
sockopt can be used to undo both SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_[CE]BPF.

reseport_detach_prog() is added and it is mostly a mirror
of the existing reuseport_attach_prog().  The differences are,
it does not call reuseport_alloc() and returns -ENOENT when
there is no old prog.
