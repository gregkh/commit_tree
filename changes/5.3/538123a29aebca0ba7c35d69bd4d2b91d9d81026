PCI: tegra: Add PCIe Gen2 link speed support

Tegra124, Tegra132, Tegra210 and Tegra186 support Gen2 link speed. After
PCIe link is up in Gen1, set target link speed as Gen2 and retrain link.
Link switches to Gen2 speed if Gen2 capable end point is connected,
otherwise the link stays in Gen1.

Per PCIe 4.0r0.9 sec 7.6.3.7 implementation note, driver needs to wait for
PCIe LTSSM to come back from recovery before retraining the link.
