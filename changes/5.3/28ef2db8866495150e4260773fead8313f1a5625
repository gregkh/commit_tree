timer: Document TIMER_PINNED

The flag hints the user that the pinned timers will always be run on a
static CPU (because that should be what "pinned" means...) but that's
not the truth, at least with the current implementation.

For example, currently if a pinned timer is set up but later mod_timer()
upon the pinned timer is invoked, mod_timer() will still try to queue the
timer on the current processor and migrate the timer if necessary.

Document it a bit with the definition of TIMER_PINNED so that all future
users will use it correctly.
