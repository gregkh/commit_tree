tools include UAPI: Sync x86's syscalls_64.tbl and generic unistd.h to pick up clone3 and pidfd_open

  05a70a8ec287 ("unistd: protect clone3 via __ARCH_WANT_SYS_CLONE3")
  8f3220a80654 ("arch: wire-up clone3() syscall")
  7615d9e1780e ("arch: wire-up pidfd_open()")

Silencing the following tools/perf build warnings

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h
  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl'
  diff -u tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl

Now 'perf trace -e pidfd*,clone*' will trace those syscalls as well as the
others with those prefixes.
