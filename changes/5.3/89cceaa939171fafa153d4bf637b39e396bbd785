selftests/bpf : clean up feature/ when make clean

An error "implicit declaration of function 'reallocarray'" can be thrown
with the following steps:

$ cd tools/testing/selftests/bpf
$ make clean && make CC=<Path to GCC 4.8.5>
$ make clean && make CC=<Path to GCC 7.x>

The cause is that the feature folder generated by GCC 4.8.5 is not
removed, leaving feature-reallocarray being 1, which causes reallocarray
not defined when re-compliing with GCC 7.x. This diff adds feature
folder to EXTRA_CLEAN to avoid this problem.

v2: Rephrase the commit message.
