USB: dwc2: Don't turn off the usbphy in suspend if wakeup is enabled

If the 'snps,need-phy-for-wake' is set in the device tree then:

- We know that we can wakeup, so call device_set_wakeup_capable().
  The USB core will use this knowledge to enable wakeup by default.
- We know that we should keep the PHY on during suspend if something
  on our root hub needs remote wakeup.  This requires the patch (USB:
  Export usb_wakeup_enabled_descendants()).  Note that we don't keep
  the PHY on at suspend time if it's not needed because it would be a
  power draw.

If we later find some users of dwc2 that can support wakeup without
keeping the PHY on we may want to add a way to call
device_set_wakeup_capable() without keeping the PHY on at suspend
time.
