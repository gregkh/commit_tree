i40e: Fix for missing "link modes" info in ethtool

Fix for missing "Supported link modes" and "Advertised link modes"
info in ethtool after changed speed on X722 devices with BASE-T PHY
with FW API version >= 1.7.
The same FW API version on X710 and X722 does not mean the same
feature set so the change was needed as mac type of the device
should also be checked instead of FW API version only.
