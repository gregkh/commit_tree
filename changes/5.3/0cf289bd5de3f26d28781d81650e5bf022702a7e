drm/i915: Move fence register tracking from i915->mm to ggtt

As the fence registers only apply to regions inside the GGTT is makes
more sense that we track these as part of the i915_ggtt and not the
general mm. In the next patch, we will then pull the register locking
underneath the i915_ggtt.mutex.
