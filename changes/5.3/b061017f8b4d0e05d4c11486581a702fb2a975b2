selftests/bpf: add realistic loop tests

Add a bunch of loop tests. Most of them are created by replacing
'#pragma unroll' with '#pragma clang loop unroll(disable)'

Several tests are artificially large:
  /* partial unroll. llvm will unroll loop ~150 times.
   * C loop count -> 600.
   * Asm loop count -> 4.
   * 16k insns in loop body.
   * Total of 5 such loops. Total program size ~82k insns.
   */
  "./pyperf600.o",

  /* no unroll at all.
   * C loop count -> 600.
   * ASM loop count -> 600.
   * ~110 insns in loop body.
   * Total of 5 such loops. Total program size ~1500 insns.
   */
  "./pyperf600_nounroll.o",

  /* partial unroll. 19k insn in a loop.
   * Total program size 20.8k insn.
   * ~350k processed_insns
   */
  "./strobemeta.o",
