Revert "net: ethernet: bgmac: Use devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname"

This reverts commit 3710e80952cf2dc48257ac9f145b117b5f74e0a5.

Since idm_base and nicpm_base are still optional resources not present
on all platforms, this breaks the driver for everything except Northstar
2 (which has both).

The same change was already reverted once with 755f5738ff98 ("net:
broadcom: fix a mistake about ioremap resource").

So let's do it again.
