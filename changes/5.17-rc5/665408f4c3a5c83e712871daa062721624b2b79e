brcmfmac: firmware: Fix crash in brcm_alt_fw_path

The call to brcm_alt_fw_path in brcmf_fw_get_firmwares is not protected
by a check to the validity of the fwctx->req->board_type pointer. This
results in a crash in strlcat when, for example, the WLAN chip is found
in a USB dongle.

Prevent the crash by adding the necessary check.
