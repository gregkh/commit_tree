HID: apple: Set the tilde quirk flag on the Wellspring 5 and later

Markus reports that his 2011 MacBook with a German ISO keyboard (USB
product code 05ac:0246, HID country code 13) has the tilde key quirk.
Seeing as all of the standalone Apple ISO keyboards since about 2008
have the quirk, it seems reasonable to assume that once the integrated
laptop keyboards started having the quirk, they likewise never stopped
having it.
