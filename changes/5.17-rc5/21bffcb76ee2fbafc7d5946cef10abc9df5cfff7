selftests/seccomp: Fix seccomp failure by adding missing headers

seccomp_bpf failed on tests 47 global.user_notification_filter_empty
and 48 global.user_notification_filter_empty_threaded when it's
tested on updated kernel but with old kernel headers. Because old
kernel headers don't have definition of macro __NR_clone3 which is
required for these two tests. Since under selftests/, we can install
headers once for all tests (the default INSTALL_HDR_PATH is
usr/include), fix it by adding usr/include to the list of directories
to be searched. Use "-isystem" to indicate it's a system directory as
the real kernel headers directories are.
