mmc: block: fix read single on recovery logic

On reads with MMC_READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK that fail,
the recovery handler will use MMC_READ_SINGLE_BLOCK for
each of the blocks, up to MMC_READ_SINGLE_RETRIES times each.
The logic for this is fixed to never report unsuccessful reads
as success to the block layer.

On command error with retries remaining, blk_update_request was
called with whatever value error was set last to.
In case it was last set to BLK_STS_OK (default), the read will be
reported as success, even though there was no data read from the device.
This could happen on a CRC mismatch for the response,
a card rejecting the command (e.g. again due to a CRC mismatch).
In case it was last set to BLK_STS_IOERR, the error is reported correctly,
but no retries will be attempted.
