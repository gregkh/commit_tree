parisc: Add ioread64_lo_hi() and iowrite64_lo_hi()

It's a followup to the previous commit f15309d7ad5d ("parisc: Add
ioread64_hi_lo() and iowrite64_hi_lo()") which does only half of
the job. Add the rest, so we won't get a new kernel test robot
reports.

Fixes: f15309d7ad5d ("parisc: Add ioread64_hi_lo() and iowrite64_hi_lo()")
