perf cs-etm: Fix corrupt inject files when only last branch option is enabled

'perf inject' with Coresight data generates files that cannot be opened
when only the last branch option is specified:

  perf inject -i perf.data --itrace=l -o inject.data
  perf script -i inject.data
  0x33faa8 [0x8]: failed to process type: 9 [Bad address]

This is because cs_etm__synth_instruction_sample() is called even when
the sample type for instructions hasn't been setup. Last branch records
are attached to instruction samples so it doesn't make sense to generate
them when --itrace=i isn't specified anyway.

This change disables all calls of cs_etm__synth_instruction_sample()
unless --itrace=i is specified, resulting in a file with no samples if
only --itrace=l is provided, rather than a bad file.
