Input: clear BTN_RIGHT/MIDDLE on buttonpads

Buttonpads are expected to map the INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD property bit
and the BTN_LEFT key bit.

As explained in the specification, where a device has a button type
value of 0 (click-pad) or 1 (pressure-pad) there should not be
discrete buttons:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/touchpad-windows-precision-touchpad-collection#device-capabilities-feature-report

However, some drivers map the BTN_RIGHT and/or BTN_MIDDLE key bits even
though the device is a buttonpad and therefore does not have those
buttons.

This behavior has forced userspace applications like libinput to
implement different workarounds and quirks to detect buttonpads and
offer to the user the right set of features and configuration options.
For more information:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/merge_requests/726

In order to avoid this issue clear the BTN_RIGHT and BTN_MIDDLE key
bits when the input device is register if the INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD
property bit is set.

Notice that this change will not affect udev because it does not check
for buttons. See systemd/src/udev/udev-builtin-input_id.c.
