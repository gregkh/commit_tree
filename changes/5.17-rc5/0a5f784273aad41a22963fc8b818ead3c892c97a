KVM: SVM: extract avic_ring_doorbell

The check on the current CPU adds an extra level of indentation to
svm_deliver_avic_intr and conflates documentation on what happens
if the vCPU exits (of interest to svm_deliver_avic_intr) and migrates
(only of interest to avic_ring_doorbell, which calls get/put_cpu()).
Extract the wrmsr to a separate function and rewrite the
comment in svm_deliver_avic_intr().
