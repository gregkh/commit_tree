mtd: rawnand: brcmnand: Fixed incorrect sub-page ECC status

The brcmnand driver contains a bug in which if a page (example 2k byte)
is read from the parallel/ONFI NAND and within that page a subpage (512
byte) has correctable errors which is followed by a subpage with
uncorrectable errors, the page read will return the wrong status of
correctable (as opposed to the actual status of uncorrectable.)

The bug is in function brcmnand_read_by_pio where there is a check for
uncorrectable bits which will be preempted if a previous status for
correctable bits is detected.

The fix is to stop checking for bad bits only if we already have a bad
bits status.
