cifs: fix confusing unneeded warning message on smb2.1 and earlier

When mounting with SMB2.1 or earlier, even with nomultichannel, we
log the confusing warning message:
  "CIFS: VFS: multichannel is not supported on this protocol version, use 3.0 or above"

Fix this so that we don't log this unless they really are trying
to mount with multichannel.
