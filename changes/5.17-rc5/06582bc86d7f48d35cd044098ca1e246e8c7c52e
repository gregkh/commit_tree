block: loop:use kstatfs.f_bsize of backing file to set discard granularity

If backing file's filesystem has implemented ->fallocate(), we think the
loop device can support discard, then pass sb->s_blocksize as
discard_granularity. However, some underlying FS, such as overlayfs,
doesn't set sb->s_blocksize, and causes discard_granularity to be set as
zero, then the warning in __blkdev_issue_discard() is triggered.

Christoph suggested to pass kstatfs.f_bsize as discard granularity, and
this way is fine because kstatfs.f_bsize means 'Optimal transfer block
size', which still matches with definition of discard granularity.

So fix the issue by setting discard_granularity as kstatfs.f_bsize if it
is available, otherwise claims discard isn't supported.
