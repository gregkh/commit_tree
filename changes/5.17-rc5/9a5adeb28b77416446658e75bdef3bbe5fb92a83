ALSA: usb-audio: Don't abort resume upon errors

The default mixer resume code treats the errors at restoring the
modified mixer items as a fatal error, and it returns back to the
caller.  This ends up in the resume failure, and the device will be
come unavailable, although basically those errors are intermittent and
can be safely ignored.

The problem itself has been present from the beginning, but it didn't
hit usually because the code tries to resume only the modified items.
But now with the recent commit to forcibly initialize each item at the
probe time, the problem surfaced more often, hence it appears as a
regression.

This patch fixes the regression simply by ignoring the errors at
resume.
