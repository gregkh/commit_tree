iwlwifi: mei: report RFKILL upon register when needed

When we register and we are in link protection passive, meaning
that the host can't touch the device, report RFKILL immediately
upon register() and don't wait for the CSME firmware to let us
know again about the link protection state.

What happens if we wait is that the host will not see RFKILL soon
enough and we'll have a window of time during which it can bring
up the device which will request ownership.
