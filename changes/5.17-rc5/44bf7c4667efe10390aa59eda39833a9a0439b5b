iwlwifi: mei: retry mapping the shared area

The shared area is a DMA memory allocated in the host and
mapped so that the host and the CSME firmware can
exchange data. It is mapped through a dedicated PCI device
that is driven by the mei bus driver.

The bus driver is in charge of allocating and mapping this
memory. It also needs to configure the CSME firmware with
a specific set of commands, so that the CSME firmware will
know that this memory is meant to be used by its internal
WLAN module.

For this, the CSME firmware first needs to completely
initialize its WLAN module and only then get the mapping
request.

The problem is that the mei bus enumeration completes
before the WLAN is completely ready. This means that
the WLAN module's initialization is racing with iwlmei's
allocation and mapping flow.

Testing showed a problem in resume flows where iwlmei
was too fast and the DMA mapping failed.

Add a retry mechanism to make sure that we will succeed
to map the memory.
