iwlwifi: fix use-after-free

If no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the
firmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling
device_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then in
iwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the 'drv' struct. However
the new code I added will still erroneously access it after it
was freed.

Set 'failure=false' in this case to avoid the access, all data
was already freed anyway.
