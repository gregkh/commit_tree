ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix deadlock by COEF mutex

The recently introduced coef_mutex for Realtek codec seems causing a
deadlock when the relevant code is invoked from the power-off state;
then the HD-audio core tries to power-up internally, and this kicks
off the codec runtime PM code that tries to take the same coef_mutex.

In order to avoid the deadlock, do the temporary power up/down around
the coef_mutex acquisition and release.  This assures that the
power-up sequence runs before the mutex, hence no re-entrance will
happen.
