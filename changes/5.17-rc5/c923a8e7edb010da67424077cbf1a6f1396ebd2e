ucounts: Move RLIMIT_NPROC handling after set_user

During set*id() which cred->ucounts to charge the the current process
to is not known until after set_cred_ucounts.  So move the
RLIMIT_NPROC checking into a new helper flag_nproc_exceeded and call
flag_nproc_exceeded after set_cred_ucounts.

This is very much an arbitrary subset of the places where we currently
change the RLIMIT_NPROC accounting, designed to preserve the existing
logic.

Fixing the existing logic will be the subject of another series of
changes.
