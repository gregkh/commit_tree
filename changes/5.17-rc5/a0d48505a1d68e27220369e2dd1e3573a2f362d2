i2c: qcom-cci: don't delete an unregistered adapter

If i2c_add_adapter() fails to add an I2C adapter found on QCOM CCI
controller, on error path i2c_del_adapter() is still called.

Fortunately there is a sanity check in the I2C core, so the only
visible implication is a printed debug level message:

    i2c-core: attempting to delete unregistered adapter [Qualcomm-CCI]

Nevertheless it would be reasonable to correct the probe error path.
