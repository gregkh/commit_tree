regulator: core: fix false positive in regulator_late_cleanup()

The check done by regulator_late_cleanup() to detect whether a regulator
is on was inconsistent with the check done by _regulator_is_enabled().
While _regulator_is_enabled() takes the enable GPIO into account,
regulator_late_cleanup() was not doing that.

This resulted in a false positive, e.g. when a GPIO-controlled fixed
regulator was used, which was not enabled at boot time, e.g.

reg_disp_1v2: reg_disp_1v2 {
	compatible = "regulator-fixed";
	regulator-name = "display_1v2";
	regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
	regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
	gpio = <&tlmm 148 0>;
	enable-active-high;
};

Such regulator doesn't have an is_enabled() operation. Nevertheless
it's state can be determined based on the enable GPIO. The check in
regulator_late_cleanup() wrongly assumed that the regulator is on and
tried to disable it.
