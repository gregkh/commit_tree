HID: amd_sfh: Add functionality to clear interrupts

Newer AMD platforms with SFH may generate interrupts on some events
which are unwarranted. Until this is cleared the actual MP2 data
processing maybe stalled in some cases.

Add a mechanism to clear the pending interrupts (if any) during the
driver initialization and sensor command operations.
