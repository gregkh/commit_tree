phy: rockchip-inno-usb2: remove redundant assignment to variable delay

Variable delay is being assigned to zero and the code falls through to
the next case in a switch statement that returns out of the function.
The variable is never read in this scenario and so the assignment is
redundant and can be removed.

Cleans up scan-build static analysis warning:
drivers/phy/rockchip/phy-rockchip-inno-usb2.c:753:3: warning: Value
stored to 'delay' is never read [deadcode.DeadStores]
