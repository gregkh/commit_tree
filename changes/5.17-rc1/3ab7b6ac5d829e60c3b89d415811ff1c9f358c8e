pwm: Introduce single-PWM of_xlate function

The existing pxa driver and the upcoming addition of PWM support in the
TI sn565dsi86 DSI/eDP bridge driver both has a single PWM channel and
thereby a need for a of_xlate function with the period as its single
argument.

Introduce a common helper function in the core that can be used as
of_xlate by such drivers and migrate the pxa driver to use this.
