docs/vm: clarify overcommit amount sysctl behavior

Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting.rst says that the overcommit
amount can be set via vm.overcommit_ratio and vm.overcommit_kbytes.

Add a clarification that those only take effect in overcommit handling
mode 2 ("Don't overcommit"), i.e. they do not act as an "additional"
limit that is always enforced.
