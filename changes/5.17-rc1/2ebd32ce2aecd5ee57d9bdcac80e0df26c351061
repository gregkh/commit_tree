watchdog: simatic-ipc-wdt: add new driver for Siemens Industrial PCs

This driver adds initial support for several devices from Siemens. It is
based on a platform driver introduced in an earlier commit.

One of the supported machines does access a GPIO pin to enable the
watchdog. Here we poke GPIO memory because pinctrl does not come up.
