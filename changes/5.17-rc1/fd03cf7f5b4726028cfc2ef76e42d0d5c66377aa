ASoC: sun8i-codec: Add AIF, ADC, and DAC volume controls

This allows changing the volume of each digital input/output
independently, and provides the only "master volume" for the DAC.
(The ADC also has a gain control on the analog side.)

While the hardware supports digital gain up to +72dB, the controls here
are limited to +24dB maximum, as any gain above that level makes volume
sliders difficult to use, and is extremely likely to cause clipping.
