drm/i915/pmu: Wait longer for busyness data to be available from GuC

live_engine_busy_stats waits for busyness to start ticking before
sampling busyness for the test sample duration. The wait accesses an
MMIO register and the uncore call to read it takes up to 3 ms in the
worst case. This can result in the wait timing out since the MMIO read
itself consumes up the timeout of 500us. Increase the timeout to a
larger value of 10ms to account for the MMIO read time.
