random: remove incomplete last_data logic

There were a few things added under the "if (fips_enabled)" banner,
which never really got completed, and the FIPS people anyway are
choosing a different direction. Rather than keep around this halfbaked
code, get rid of it so that we can focus on a single design of the RNG
rather than two designs.
