hwmon: (nct6775) Additional check for ChipID before ASUS WMI usage

WMI monitoring methods can be changed or removed in new ASUS boards
BIOS versions. Such versions return zero instead of a real one as
Chip ID.

Commit adds additional validation for the result of Chip ID call
before enabling access by ASUS WMI methods.
