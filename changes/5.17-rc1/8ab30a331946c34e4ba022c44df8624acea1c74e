blk-mq: Drop busy_iter_fn blk_mq_hw_ctx argument

The only user of blk_mq_hw_ctx blk_mq_hw_ctx argument is
blk_mq_rq_inflight().

Function blk_mq_rq_inflight() uses the hctx to find the associated request
queue to match against the request. However this same check is already
done in caller bt_iter(), so drop this check.

With that change there are no more users of busy_iter_fn blk_mq_hw_ctx
argument, so drop the argument.
