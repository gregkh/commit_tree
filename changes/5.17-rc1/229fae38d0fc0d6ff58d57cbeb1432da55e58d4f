libbpf: Add "bool skipped" to struct bpf_map

Fix error: "failed to pin map: Bad file descriptor, path:
/sys/fs/bpf/_rodata_str1_1."

In the old kernel, the global data map will not be created, see [0]. So
we should skip the pinning of the global data map to avoid
bpf_object__pin_maps returning error. Therefore, when the map is not
created, we mark â€œmap->skipped" as true and then check during relocation
and during pinning.
