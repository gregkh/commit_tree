arm64: tegra: Sort Tegra210 XUSB clocks correctly

Make the order of the clocks and clock-names properties match the order
in the device tree bindings. This isn't strictly necessary from a point
of view of the operating system because matching will be done based on
the clock-names, but it makes it easier to validate the device trees
against the DT schema.
