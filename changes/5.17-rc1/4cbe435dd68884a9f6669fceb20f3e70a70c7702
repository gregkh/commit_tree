drm/amd/display: retain/release stream pointer in link enc table

[why]
At every reference to stream pointer, we need to increment/decrement the
kref_count.  Not doing so will result in invalid stream pointer still
alive after hibernate cycle.

[how]
Call stream retain/release whenever the link encoder assignment is set
to true/false since it indicates if we want to reference the stream
pointer or not.
