ASoC: rt5640: Add support for boards with an external jack-detect GPIO

Some boards have the codec IRQ hooked-up as normally, so the driver can
still do things like headset vs headphones and button-press detection,
but instead of using one of the JD pins of the codec, an external GPIO
is used to report the jack-presence switch status of the jack.

Add support for this.
