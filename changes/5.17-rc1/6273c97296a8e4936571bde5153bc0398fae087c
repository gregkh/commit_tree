carl9170: Use the bitmap API when applicable

Use 'bitmap_zalloc()' to simplify code, improve the semantic and avoid some
open-coded arithmetic in allocator arguments.

Note, that this 'bitmap_zalloc()' divides by BITS_PER_LONG the amount of
memory allocated.
The 'roundup()' used to computed the number of needed long should have
been a DIV_ROUND_UP.


Also change the corresponding 'kfree()' into 'bitmap_free()' to keep
consistency.

Use 'bitmap_zero()' to avoid hand writing it.
