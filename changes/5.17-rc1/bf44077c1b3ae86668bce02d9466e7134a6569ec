af_packet: fix tracking issues in packet_do_bind()

It appears that my changes in packet_do_bind() were
slightly wrong.

syzbot found that calling bind() twice would trigger
a false positive.

Remove proto_curr/dev_curr variables and rewrite things
to be less confusing (like not having to use netdev_tracker_alloc(),
and instead use the standard dev_hold_track())
