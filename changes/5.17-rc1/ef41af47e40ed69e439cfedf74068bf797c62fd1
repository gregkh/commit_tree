drm/panel: ls037v7dw01: Make use of the helper function dev_err_probe()

When possible use dev_err_probe help to properly deal with the
PROBE_DEFER error, the benefit is that DEFER issue will be logged
in the devices_deferred debugfs file.
And using dev_err_probe() can reduce code size, the error value
gets printed.
