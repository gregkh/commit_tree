perf/arm-cmn: Add debugfs topology info

In general, detailed performance analysis will require knoweldge of the
the SoC beyond the CMN itself - e.g. which actual CPUs/peripherals/etc.
are connected to each node. However for certain development and bringup
tasks it can be useful to have a quick overview of the CMN internal
topology to hand too. Add a debugfs file to map this out.
