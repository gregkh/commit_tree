pwm: tegra: Add runtime PM and OPP support

The PWM on Tegra belongs to the core power domain and we're going to
enable GENPD support for the core domain. Now PWM must be resumed using
runtime PM API in order to initialize the PWM power state. The PWM clock
rate must be changed using OPP API that will reconfigure the power domain
performance state in accordance to the rate. Add runtime PM and OPP
support to the PWM driver.
