Revert "net: wwan: iosm: Keep device at D0 for s2idle case"

Depending on BIOS configuration IOSM driver exchanges
protocol required for putting device into D3L2 or D3L1.2.

ipc_pcie_suspend_s2idle() is implemented to put device to D3L1.2.

This patch forces PCI core know this device should stay at D0.
- pci_save_state()is expensive since it does a lot of slow PCI
config reads.

The reported issue is not observed on x86 platform. The supurios
wake on AMD platform needs to be futher debugged with orignal patch
submitter [1]. Also the impact of adding pci_save_state() needs to be
assessed by testing it on other platforms.

This reverts commit f4dd5174e273("net: wwan: iosm: Keep device
at D0 for s2idle case").
