rtc: pcf85063: add i2c_device_id name matching support

The pcf85063 driver regsitration currently supports the "compatible"
property type of matching (for DT).

This patch adds "matching by name" support to the driver by defining
an i2c_device_id table and setting the id_table parameter in the
i2c_driver struct.

This will, for example, make the driver easier to instantiate on
systems where CONFIG_OF is not enabled (x86 in my case).
