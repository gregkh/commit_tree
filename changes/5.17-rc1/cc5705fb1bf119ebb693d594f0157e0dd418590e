KVM: arm64: Drop vcpu->arch.has_run_once for vcpu->pid

With the transition to kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change() to handle
the "run once" activities, it becomes obvious that has_run_once
is now an exact shadow of vcpu->pid.

Replace vcpu->arch.has_run_once with a new vcpu_has_run_once()
helper that directly checks for vcpu->pid, and get rid of the
now unused field.
