net: hns3: refactor PF rss get APIs with new common rss get APIs

This patch firstly uses new rss parameter struct(hclge_comm_rss_cfg) as
child member of hclge_dev and deletes the original child rss parameter
members in vport. All the vport child rss parameter members used in PF rss
module is modified according to the new hclge_comm_rss_cfg.

Secondly PF rss get APIs are refactored to use new common rss get APIs. The
old rss get APIs in PF are deleted.
