clk: qcom: smd-rpm: Drop binary value handling for buffered clock

The buffered clock binary value handling added by commit 36354c32bd76
("clk: qcom: smd-rpm: Add .recalc_rate hook for clk_smd_rpm_branch_ops")
is redundant, because buffered clock is branch type, and the binary
value handling for branch clock has been handled by
clk_smd_rpm_prepare/unprepare functions.
