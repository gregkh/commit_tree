ACPI: CPPC: Check present CPUs for determining _CPC is valid

As this is a static check, it should be based upon what is currently
present on the system. This makes probeing more deterministic.

While local APIC flags field (lapic_flags) of cpu core in MADT table is
0, then the cpu core won't be enabled. In this case, _CPC won't be found
in this core, and return back to _CPC invalid with walking through
possible cpus (include disable cpus). This is not expected, so switch to
check present CPUs instead.
