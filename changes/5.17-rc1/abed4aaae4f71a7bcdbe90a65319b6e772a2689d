btrfs: track the csum, extent, and free space trees in a rb tree

In the future we are going to have multiple copies of these trees.  To
facilitate this we need a way to lookup the different roots we are
looking for.  Handle this by adding a global root rb tree that is
indexed on the root->root_key.  Then instead of loading the roots at
mount time with individually targeted keys, simply search the tree_root
for anything with the specific objectid we want.  This will make it
straightforward to support both old style and new style file systems.
