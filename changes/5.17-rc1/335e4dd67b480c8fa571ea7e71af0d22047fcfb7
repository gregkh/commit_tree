xen/x86: obtain upper 32 bits of video frame buffer address for Dom0

The hypervisor has been supplying this information for a couple of major
releases. Make use of it. The need to set a flag in the capabilities
field also points out that the prior setting of that field from the
hypervisor interface's gbl_caps one was wrong, so that code gets deleted
(there's also no equivalent of this in native boot code).
