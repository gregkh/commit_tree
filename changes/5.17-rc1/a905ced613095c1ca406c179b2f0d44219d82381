drm/i915: Query the vswing levels per-lane for tgl dkl phy

Prepare for per-lane drive settings by querying the desired vswing
level per-lane.

Note that the code only does two loops, with each one writing the
levels for two TX lanes. The register offsets also look a bit funny
because each time through the loop we write to the exact same
register offsets. The crucial bit is the HIP_INDEX_REG
write that steers the same mmio window into different places.
