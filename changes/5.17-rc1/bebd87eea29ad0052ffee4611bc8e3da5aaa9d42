wcn36xx: Implement beacon filtering

The prima driver facilitates the direct programming of beacon filter tables via
SMD commands.

The purpose of beacon filters is quote:

/* When beacon filtering is enabled, firmware will
 * analyze the selected beacons received during BMPS,
 * and monitor any changes in the IEs as listed below.
 * The format of the table is:
 *    - EID
 *    - Check for IE presence
 *    - Byte offset
 *    - Byte value
 *    - Bit Mask
 *    - Byte reference
 */

The default filter table looks something like this:

tBeaconFilterIe gaBcnFilterTable[12] =
{
  { WLAN_EID_DS_PARAMS, 0u, { 0u, 0u, 0u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_ERP_INFO, 0u, { 0u, 0u, 248u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_EDCA_PARAM_SET, 0u, { 0u, 0u, 240u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_QOS_CAPA, 0u, { 0u, 0u, 240u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_CHANNEL_SWITCH, 1u, { 0u, 0u, 0u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_QUIET, 1u, { 0u, 0u, 0u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_HT_OPERATION, 0u, { 0u, 0u, 0u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_HT_OPERATION, 0u, { 1u, 0u, 248u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_HT_OPERATION, 0u, { 2u, 0u, 235u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_HT_OPERATION, 0u, { 5u, 0u, 253u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_PWR_CONSTRAINT, 0u, { 0u, 0u, 0u, 0u } },
  { WLAN_EID_OPMODE_NOTIF, 0u, { 0u, 0u, 0u, 0u } }
};

Add in an equivalent filter set as present in the prima Linux driver.
For now omit the beacon filter "rem" command as the driver does not have an
explicit call to that SMD command. The filter mask should only count when
we are inside BMPS anyway.

Replicating the ability to program the filter table gives us scope to add and
remove elements in future. For now though this patch makes the rote-copy of the
downstream Linux beacon filter table, which we can tweak as desired from now
on.
