can: flexcan: add ethtool support to change rx-rtr setting during runtime

This patch adds a private flag to the flexcan driver to switch the
"rx-rtr" setting on and off.

"rx-rtr" on  - Receive RTR frames. (default)
               The CAN controller can and will receive RTR frames.

	       On some IP cores the controller cannot receive RTR
	       frames in the more performant "RX mailbox" mode and
	       will use "RX FIFO" mode instead.

"rx-rtr" off - Waive ability to receive RTR frames. (not supported on all IP cores)
               This mode activates the "RX mailbox mode" for better
	       performance, on some IP cores RTR frames cannot be
	       received anymore.

The "RX FIFO" mode uses a FIFO with a depth of 6 CAN frames.
The "RX mailbox" mode uses up to 62 mailboxes.
