s390/qdio: clean up access to queue in qdio_handle_activate_check()

qdio_handle_activate_check() re-uses a queue-specific handler to report
that the ACTIVATE ccw has been terminated. It uses either the first
input or output queue, so we can hard-code q->nr as 0. Also don't
access the q->irq_ptr parent pointer, we already have a pointer to
the qdio_irq.
