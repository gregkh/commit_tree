ASoC: cs35l41: Move power initializations to reg_sequence

ASoC and HDA systems for all revisions of CS35L41 will benefit
from having this initialization, so add it to reg_sequence of
each revision

By moving to reg_sequence all gains are set to zero. And boost,
monitoring parts, and class D amplifier are disabled.
