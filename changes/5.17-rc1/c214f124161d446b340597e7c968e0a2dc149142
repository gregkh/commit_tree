arch_topology: Introduce thermal pressure update function

The thermal pressure is a mechanism which is used for providing
information about reduced CPU performance to the scheduler. Usually code
has to convert the value from frequency units into capacity units,
which are understandable by the scheduler. Create a common conversion code
which can be just used via a handy API.

Internally, the topology_update_thermal_pressure() operates on frequency
in MHz and max CPU frequency is taken from 'freq_factor' (per-cpu).
