drm/i915: Fix up skl_program_plane() pxp stuff

There's lots of expensive stuff inserted between the PLANE_CTL
and  PLANE_SURF writes even though the comment before the PLANE_CTL
write says not to put stuff there. Move it all to a more apporiate
place.

There's also a weird PLANE_COLOR_CTL RMW in there. I guess because
force_black was computed way too late originally, but that is now
sorted.
