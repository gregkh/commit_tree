fscache: Provide a function to resize a cookie

Provide a function to change the size of the storage attached to a cookie,
to match the size of the file being cached when it's changed by truncate or
fallocate:

	void fscache_resize_cookie(struct fscache_cookie *cookie,
				   loff_t new_size);

This acts synchronously and is expected to run under the inode lock of the
caller.
