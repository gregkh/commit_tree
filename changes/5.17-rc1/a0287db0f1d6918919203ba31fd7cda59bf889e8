signal: Have prepare_signal detect coredumps using signal->core_state

In preparation for removing the flag SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP, change
prepare_signal to test signal->core_state instead of the flag
SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP.

Both fields are protected by siglock and both live in signal_struct so
there are no real tradeoffs here, just a change to which field is
being tested.
