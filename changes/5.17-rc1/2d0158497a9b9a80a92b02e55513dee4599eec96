drm/amd/display: Block z-states when stutter period exceeds criteria

[Why]
Stutter period won't be less than 5000.0, but if PSR is enabled then we
can potentially enter Z9 when MPO is enabled.

SMU will try to enter Z9 too early in these cases (before PSR is
enabled) and we'll see underflow.

[How]
Block z-states (z9, z10) until we can add a new interface to SMU to
signal when we can support z10 but not z9.

We can revert this once the interface change is in.
