RDMA/irdma: Use irq_update_affinity_hint()

The driver uses irq_set_affinity_hint() to update the affinity_hint mask
that is consumed by the userspace to distribute the interrupts. However,
under the hood irq_set_affinity_hint() also applies the provided cpumask
(if not NULL) as the affinity for the given interrupt which is an
undocumented side effect.

To remove this side effect irq_set_affinity_hint() has been marked
as deprecated and new interfaces have been introduced. Hence, replace the
irq_set_affinity_hint() with the new interface irq_update_affinity_hint()
that only updates the affinity_hint pointer.
