drm/bridge: tc358768: Disable non-continuous clock mode

Non-continuous clock mode doesn't work because driver doesn't support it
properly. The bridge driver programs wrong bitfields that are required by
the non-continuous mode (BTACNTRL1 register bitfields are swapped in the
code), but fixing them doesn't help.

Display panel of ASUS Transformer TF700T tablet supports non-continuous
mode and display doesn't work at all using that mode. There are no
device-trees that are actively using this DSI bridge in upstream yet,
so clearly the broken mode wasn't ever tested properly. It's a bit too
difficult to get LP mode working, hence let's disable the offending mode
for now and fall back to continuous mode.
