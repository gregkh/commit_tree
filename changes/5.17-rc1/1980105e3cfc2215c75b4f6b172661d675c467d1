iommu/amd: X2apic mode: mask/unmask interrupts on suspend/resume

Use IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND to make the core irq code to
mask the iommu interrupt on suspend and unmask it on the resume.

Since now the unmask function updates the INTX settings,
that will restore them on resume from s3/s4.

Since IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND is only effective for interrupts
which are not wakeup sources, remove IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE flag
and instead implement a dummy .irq_set_wake which doesn't allow
the interrupt to become a wakeup source.
