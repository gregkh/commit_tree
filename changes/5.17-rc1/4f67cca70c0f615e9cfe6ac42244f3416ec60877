tracing: Do not let synth_events block other dyn_event systems during create

synth_events is returning -EINVAL if the dyn_event create command does
not contain ' \t'. This prevents other systems from getting called back.
synth_events needs to return -ECANCELED in these cases when the command
is not targeting the synth_event system.
