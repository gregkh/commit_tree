usb: dwc3: gadget: Skip reading GEVNTSIZn

The driver knows what it needs to set for GEVNTSIZn, and the controller
doesn't modify this register unless there's a hard reset. To save a few
microseconds of register read in read-modify-write operation, simply do
register write with the expected values. This can improve performance
when there are many interrupts generated, which the driver needs to
check and handle.
