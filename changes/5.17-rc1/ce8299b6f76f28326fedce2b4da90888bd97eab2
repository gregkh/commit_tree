Revert "net: snmp: add statistics for tcp small queue check"

This reverts commit aeeecb889165617a841e939117f9a8095d0e7d80.

The new SNMP variable (TCPSmallQueueFailure) can be incremented
for good reasons, even on a 100Gbit single TCP_STREAM flow.

If we really wanted to ease driver debugging [1], this would
require something more sophisticated.

[1] Usually, if a driver is delaying TX completions too much,
this can lead to stalls in TCP output. Various work arounds
have been used in the past, like skb_orphan() in ndo_start_xmit().
