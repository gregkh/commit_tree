platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Register a privacy-screen device

Register a privacy-screen device on laptops with a privacy-screen,
this exports the PrivacyGuard features to user-space using a
standardized vendor-agnostic sysfs interface. Note the sysfs interface
is read-only.

Registering a privacy-screen device with the new privacy-screen class
code will also allow the GPU driver to get a handle to it and export
the privacy-screen setting as a property on the DRM connector object
for the LCD panel. This DRM connector property is a new standardized
interface which all user-space code should use to query and control
the privacy-screen.
