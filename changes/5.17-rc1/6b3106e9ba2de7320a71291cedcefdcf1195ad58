iommu/amd: Simplify pagetable freeing

For reasons unclear, pagetable freeing is an effectively recursive
method implemented via an elaborate system of templated functions that
turns out to account for 25% of the object file size. Implementing it
using regular straightforward recursion makes the code simpler, and
seems like a good thing to do before we work on it further. As part of
that, also fix the types to avoid all the needless casting back and
forth which just gets in the way.
