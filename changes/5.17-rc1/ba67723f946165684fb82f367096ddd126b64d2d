dt-bindings: usb: dwc2: document the port when usb-role-switch is used

Document the "port" property, which is used with "usb-role-switch"
to describe the bus connector.
Definition is inspired from mediatek,mtu3.yaml.

This fixes some errors seen when running "make dtbs_check":
... 'port' does not match any of the regexes: 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'
        From schema: ... Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/dwc2.yaml

Note: add dependencies so that 'usb-role-switch' without port is valid or
both must be present.
