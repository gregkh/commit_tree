nvme-fabrics: print out valid arguments when reading from /dev/nvme-fabrics

Currently applications have a hard time figuring out which
nvme-over-fabrics arguments are supported for any given kernel;
the ioctl will return an error code on failure, and the application
has to guess whether this was due to an invalid argument or due
to a connection or controller error.
With this patch applications can read a list of supported
arguments by simply reading from /dev/nvme-fabrics, allowing
them to validate the connection string.
