RISC-V: Use common riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask() for both SMP=y and SMP=n

Use what is currently the SMP=y version of riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask()
for both SMP=y and SMP=n to fix a build failure with KVM=m and SMP=n due
to boot_cpu_hartid not being exported.  This also fixes a second bug
where the SMP=n version assumes the sole CPU in the system is in the
incoming mask, which may not hold true in kvm_riscv_vcpu_sbi_ecall() if
the KVM guest VM has multiple vCPUs (on a SMP=n system).
