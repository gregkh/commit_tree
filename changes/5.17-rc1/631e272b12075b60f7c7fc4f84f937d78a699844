comedi: Move and rename "8255.h" to <linux/comedi/comedi_8255.h>

Some of the header files in "drivers/comedi/drivers/" are common enough
to be useful to out-of-tree comedi driver modules.  Using them for
out-of-tree module builds is hampered by the headers being outside the
"include/" directory so it is desirable to move them.

There are about a couple of dozen Comedi device drivers that use the
"comedi_8255" module to add digital I/O subdevices based on the
venerable 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface chip.  The macros and
declarations to use that module are in the "8255.h" header file in the
comedi "drivers" directory.  Move it into "include/linux/comedi/" and
rename it to "comedi_8255.h" for naming consistency reasons.
