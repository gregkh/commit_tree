selftest: kvm: Add amx selftest

This selftest covers two aspects of AMX.  The first is triggering #NM
exception and checking the MSR XFD_ERR value.  The second case is
loading tile config and tile data into guest registers and trapping to
the host side for a complete save/load of the guest state.  TMM0
is also checked against memory data after save/restore.
