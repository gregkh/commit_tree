compiler_attributes.h: Add __disable_sanitizer_instrumentation

The new attribute maps to
__attribute__((disable_sanitizer_instrumentation)), which will be
supported by Clang >= 14.0. Future support in GCC is also possible.

This attribute disables compiler instrumentation for kernel sanitizer
tools, making it easier to implement noinstr. It is different from the
existing __no_sanitize* attributes, which may still allow certain types
of instrumentation to prevent false positives.
