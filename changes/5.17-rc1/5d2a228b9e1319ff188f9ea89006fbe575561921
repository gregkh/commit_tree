dm: make the DAX support depend on CONFIG_FS_DAX

The device mapper DAX support is all hanging off a block device and thus
can't be used with device dax.  Make it depend on CONFIG_FS_DAX instead
of CONFIG_DAX_DRIVER.  This also means that bdev_dax_pgoff only needs to
be built under CONFIG_FS_DAX now.
