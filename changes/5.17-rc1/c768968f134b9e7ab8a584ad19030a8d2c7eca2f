remoteproc: ingenic: Request IRQ disabled

The ingenic remoteproc driver requests its IRQ and then immediately
disables it.

The disable is necessary since irq_request() normally enables the IRQ. But
there is a new flag IRQF_NO_AUTOEN that when specified keeps the IRQ
disabled. Use this new flag rather than calling disable_irq().

This slightly reduce the boilerplate code and also avoids a theoretical
race condition where the IRQ could fire between irq_request() and
disable_irq().
