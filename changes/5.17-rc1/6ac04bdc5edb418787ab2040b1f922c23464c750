ath11k: Use reserved host DDR addresses from DT for PCI devices

Host DDR memory (contiguous 45 MB in mode-0 or 15 MB in mode-2)
is reserved through DT entries for firmware usage. Send the base
address from DT entries.
If DT entry is available, PCI device will work with
fixed_mem_region else host allocates multiple segments.

IPQ8074 on HK10 board supports multiple PCI devices.
IPQ8074 + QCN9074 is tested with this patch.

Tested-on: QCN9074 hw1.0 PCI WLAN.HK.2.4.0.1-01838-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
