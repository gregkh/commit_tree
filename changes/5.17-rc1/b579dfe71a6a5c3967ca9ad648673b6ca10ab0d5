RISC-V: Use SBI SRST extension when available

The SBI SRST extension provides a standard way to poweroff and
reboot the system irrespective to whether Linux RISC-V S-mode
is running natively (HS-mode) or inside Guest/VM (VS-mode).

The SBI SRST extension is available in the SBI v0.3 specification.
(Refer, https://github.com/riscv/riscv-sbi-doc/releases/tag/v0.3.0-rc1)

This patch extends Linux RISC-V SBI implementation to detect
and use SBI SRST extension.
