ARM: dts: gemini: NAS4220-B: fis-index-block with 128 KiB sectors

Steven Maddox reported in the OpenWrt bugzilla, that his
RaidSonic IB-NAS4220-B was no longer booting with the new
OpenWrt 21.02 (uses linux 5.10's device-tree). However, it was
working with the previous OpenWrt 19.07 series (uses 4.14).

|[    5.548038] No RedBoot partition table detected in 30000000.flash

The provided bootlog shows that the RedBoot partition parser was
looking for the partition table "at offset 0x0". Which is strange
since the comment in the device-tree says it should be at 0xfe0000.

Further digging on the internet led to a review site that took
some useful PCB pictures of their review unit back in February 2009.
Their picture shows a Spansion S29GL128N11TFI01 flash chip.

>From Spansion's Datasheet:
"S29GL128N: One hundred twenty-eight 64 Kword (128 Kbyte) sectors"
Steven also provided a "cat /sys/class/mtd/mtd0/erasesize" from his
unit: "131072".

With the 128 KiB Sector/Erasesize in mind. This patch changes the
fis-index-block property to (0xfe0000 / 0x20000) = 0x7f.
