perf/arm-cmn: Drop compile-test restriction

Although CMN is currently (and overwhelmingly likely to remain) deployed
in arm64-only (modulo userspace) systems, the 64-bit "dependency" for
compile-testing was just laziness due to heavy reliance on readq/writeq
accessors. Since we only need one extra include for robustness in that
regard, let's pull that in, widen the compile-test coverage, and fix up
the smattering of type laziness that that brings to light.
