ath11k: add support for BSS color change

Whenever the MAC detects a color collision, or any of
its associated stations detects one, the firmware will
send out an event. Add the code to parse and handle
this event and pass the data up to mac80211.

The firmware does not provide an offload feature such
as the one used for CSA. The color change process is
hence triggered via the beacon offload tx completion
events sent out by firmware.

BSS color feature is enabled depending on service flag
advertised by firmware, based on which color change
functionality is invoked.
