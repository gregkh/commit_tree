Input: ti_am335x_tsc - set ADCREFM for X configuration

As reported by the STEPCONFIG[1-16] registered field descriptions of the
TI reference manual, for the ADC "in single ended, SEL_INM_SWC_3_0 must
be 1xxx".

Unlike the Y and Z coordinates, this bit has not been set for the step
configuration registers used to sample the X coordinate.
