fanotify: use helpers to parcel fanotify_info buffer

fanotify_info buffer is parceled into variable sized records, so the
records must be written in order: dir_fh, file_fh, name.

Use helpers to assert that order and make fanotify_alloc_name_event()
a bit more generic to allow empty dir_fh record and to allow expanding
to more records (i.e. name2) soon.
