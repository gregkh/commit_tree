driver: soc: xilinx: register for power events in zynqmp power driver

With Xilinx Event Management driver, all types of events like power and
error gets handled from single place as part of event management driver.

So power events(SUSPEND_POWER_REQUEST and SUSPEND_SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN)
also gets handled by event management driver instead of zynqmp_power
driver.

zynqmp-power driver use event management driver and provide callback
function for Suspend and shutdown handler, which will be called by event
management driver when respective event is arrived.

If event management driver is not available than use ipi-mailbox rx channel
or IPI interrupt IRQ handler for power events (suspend/shutdown) same as
current zynqmp-power driver.
