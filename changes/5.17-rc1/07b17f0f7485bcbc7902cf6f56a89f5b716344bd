page_pool: remove spinlock in page_pool_refill_alloc_cache()

As page_pool_refill_alloc_cache() is only called by
__page_pool_get_cached(), which assumes non-concurrent access
as suggested by the comment in __page_pool_get_cached(), and
ptr_ring allows concurrent access between consumer and producer,
so remove the spinlock in page_pool_refill_alloc_cache().
