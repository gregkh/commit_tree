x86/purgatory: Remove -nostdlib compiler flag

The -nostdlib option requests the compiler to not use the standard
system startup files or libraries when linking. It is effective only
when $(CC) is used as a linker driver.

$(LD) is directly used for linking purgatory.{ro,chk} here, hence
-nostdlib is unneeded.
