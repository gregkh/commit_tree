libbpf: Add OPTS-based bpf_btf_load() API

Similar to previous bpf_prog_load() and bpf_map_create() APIs, add
bpf_btf_load() API which is taking optional OPTS struct. Schedule
bpf_load_btf() for deprecation in v0.8 ([0]).

This makes naming consistent with BPF_BTF_LOAD command, sets up an API
for extensibility in the future, moves options parameters (log-related
fields) into optional options, and also allows to pass log_level
directly.

It also removes log buffer auto-allocation logic from low-level API
(consistent with bpf_prog_load() behavior), but preserves a special
treatment of log_level == 0 with non-NULL log_buf, which matches
low-level bpf_prog_load() and high-level libbpf APIs for BTF and program
loading behaviors.
