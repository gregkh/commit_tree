blktrace: switch trace spinlock to a raw spinlock

The running_trace_lock protects running_trace_list and is acquired
within the tracepoint which implies disabled preemption. The spinlock_t
typed lock can not be acquired with disabled preemption on PREEMPT_RT
because it becomes a sleeping lock.
The runtime of the tracepoint depends on the number of entries in
running_trace_list and has no limit. The blk-tracer is considered debug
code and higher latencies here are okay.

Make running_trace_lock a raw_spinlock_t.
