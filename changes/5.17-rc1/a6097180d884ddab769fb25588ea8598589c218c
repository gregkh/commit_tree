devtmpfs regression fix: reconfigure on each mount

Prior to Linux v5.4 devtmpfs used mount_single() which treats the given
mount options as "remount" options, so it updates the configuration of
the single super_block on each mount.

Since that was changed, the mount options used for devtmpfs are ignored.
This is a regression which affect systemd - which mounts devtmpfs with
"-o mode=755,size=4m,nr_inodes=1m".

This patch restores the "remount" effect by calling reconfigure_single()
