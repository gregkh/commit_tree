powerpc/64s: Always set PMU control registers to frozen/disabled when not in use

KVM PMU management code looks for particular frozen/disabled bits in
the PMU registers so it knows whether it must clear them when coming
out of a guest or not. Setting this up helps KVM make these optimisations
without getting confused. Longer term the better approach might be to
move guest/host PMU switching to the perf subsystem.
