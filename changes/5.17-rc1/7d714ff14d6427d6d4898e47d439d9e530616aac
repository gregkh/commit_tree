net: fixup build after bpf header changes

Recent bpf-next merge brought in header changes which uncovered
includes missing in net-next which were not present in bpf-next.
Build problems happen only on less-popular arches like hppa,
sparc, alpha etc.

I could repro the build problem with ice but not the mlx5 problem
Abdul was reporting. mlx5 does look like it should include filter.h,
anyway.
