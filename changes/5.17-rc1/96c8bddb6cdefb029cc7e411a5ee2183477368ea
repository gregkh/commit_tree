dt-bindings: soc: samsung: keep SoC driver bindings together

Recently added Samsung Exynos USI driver devicetree bindings were added
under ../bindings/soc/samsung/exynos-usi.yaml, so move there also two
other bindings for Exynos SoC drivers: the PMU and ChipID.

Update Samsung Exynos MAINTAINERS entry to include this new path.
