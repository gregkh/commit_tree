crypto: qat - add PFVF support to enable the reset of ring pairs

Extend support for resetting ring pairs on the device to VFs. Such
reset happens by sending a request to the PF over the PFVF protocol.

This patch defines two new PFVF messages and adds the PFVF logic for
handling the request on PF, triggering the reset, and VFs, accepting the
'success'/'error' response.

This feature is GEN4 specific.

This patch is based on earlier work done by Zelin Deng.
