KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: POWER10 enable HAIL when running radix guests

HV interrupts may be taken with the MMU enabled when radix guests are
running. Enable LPCR[HAIL] on ISA v3.1 processors for radix guests.
Make this depend on the host LPCR[HAIL] being enabled. Currently that is
always enabled, but having this test means any issue that might require
LPCR[HAIL] to be disabled in the host will not have to be duplicated in
KVM.

This optimisation takes 1380 cycles off a NULL hcall entry+exit micro
benchmark on a POWER10.
