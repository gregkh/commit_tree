watchdog: s3c2410: Extract disable and mask code into separate functions

The s3c2410wdt_mask_and_disable_reset() function content is bound to be
changed further. Prepare it for upcoming changes by splitting into
separate "mask reset" and "disable reset" functions. But keep
s3c2410wdt_mask_and_disable_reset() function present as a facade.

This commit doesn't bring any functional change to existing devices, but
merely provides an infrastructure for upcoming chips support.
