sections: global data can be in .bss

When checking an address is located in a global data section also check
for the .bss section as global variables initialized to 0 can be in
there (-fzero-initialized-in-bss).

This was found when looking at ensure_safe_net_sysctl which was failing
to detect non-init sysctl pointing to a global data section when the
data was in the .bss section.
