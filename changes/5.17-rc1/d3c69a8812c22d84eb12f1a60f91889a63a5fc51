net: hns3: refactor PF cmdq resource APIs with new common APIs

This patch uses common cmdq resource allocate/free/query APIs to replace
the old APIs in PF cmdq module and deletes the old cmdq resource APIs.
Still we kept hclge_cmd_setup_basic_desc name as a seam API to avoid too
many meaningless replacement.
