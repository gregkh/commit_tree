NFSD: simplify locking for network notifier.

nfsd currently maintains an open-coded read/write semaphore (refcount
and wait queue) for each network namespace to ensure the nfs service
isn't shut down while the notifier is running.

This is excessive.  As there is unlikely to be contention between
notifiers and they run without sleeping, a single spinlock is sufficient
to avoid problems.
