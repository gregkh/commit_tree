scsi: message: fusion: Use dma_alloc_coherent() in mptsas_exp_repmanufacture_info()

In [1], Christoph Hellwig has proposed to remove the wrappers in
include/linux/pci-dma-compat.h.

Some reasons why this API should be removed have been given by Julia Lawall
in [2].

The only caller of mptsas_exp_repmanufacture_info() is
mptsas_probe_one_phy(). This function already calls sas_end_device_alloc()
or sas_expander_alloc(). They both already use GFP_KERNEL.

As no spin_lock is held at this point, it is safe to also use GFP_KERNEL
here.
