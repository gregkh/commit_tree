arm64: atomics: format whitespace consistently

The code for the atomic ops is formatted inconsistently, and while this
is not a functional problem it is rather distracting when working on
them.

Some have ops have consistent indentation, e.g.

| #define ATOMIC_OP_ADD_RETURN(name, mb, cl...)                           \
| static inline int __lse_atomic_add_return##name(int i, atomic_t *v)     \
| {                                                                       \
|         u32 tmp;                                                        \
|                                                                         \
|         asm volatile(                                                   \
|         __LSE_PREAMBLE                                                  \
|         "       ldadd" #mb "    %w[i], %w[tmp], %[v]\n"                 \
|         "       add     %w[i], %w[i], %w[tmp]"                          \
|         : [i] "+r" (i), [v] "+Q" (v->counter), [tmp] "=&r" (tmp)        \
|         : "r" (v)                                                       \
|         : cl);                                                          \
|                                                                         \
|         return i;                                                       \
| }

While others have negative indentation for some lines, and/or have
misaligned trailing backslashes, e.g.

| static inline void __lse_atomic_##op(int i, atomic_t *v)                        \
| {                                                                       \
|         asm volatile(                                                   \
|         __LSE_PREAMBLE                                                  \
| "       " #asm_op "     %w[i], %[v]\n"                                  \
|         : [i] "+r" (i), [v] "+Q" (v->counter)                           \
|         : "r" (v));                                                     \
| }

This patch makes the indentation consistent and also aligns the trailing
backslashes. This makes the code easier to read for those (like myself)
who are easily distracted by these inconsistencies.

This is intended as a cleanup.
There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
