KVM: VMX: Move preemption timer <=> hrtimer dance to common x86

Handle the switch to/from the hypervisor/software timer when a vCPU is
blocking in common x86 instead of in VMX.  Even though VMX is the only
user of a hypervisor timer, the logic and all functions involved are
generic x86 (unless future CPUs do something completely different and
implement a hypervisor timer that runs regardless of mode).

Handling the switch in common x86 will allow for the elimination of the
pre/post_blocks hooks, and also lets KVM switch back to the hypervisor
timer if and only if it was in use (without additional params).  Add a
comment explaining why the switch cannot be deferred to kvm_sched_out()
or kvm_vcpu_block().
