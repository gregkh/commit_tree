drm/i915: Don't read query SSEU for non-existent slice 0 on old platforms

Pre-HSW platforms don't use the gt SSEU structures; this means that
calling intel_sseu_get_subslices() on slice 0 for these platforms will
trip a GEM_BUG_ON(slice >= sseu->max_slices) warning.

Let's move the DSS lookup for a DG2 workaround into a helper function
that will only get called after we've already decided that we're on a
DG2 platform.
