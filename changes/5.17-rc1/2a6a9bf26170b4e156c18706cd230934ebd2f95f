libbpf: Don't call libc APIs with NULL pointers

Sanitizer complains about qsort(), bsearch(), and memcpy() being called
with NULL pointer. This can only happen when the associated number of
elements is zero, so no harm should be done. But still prevent this from
happening to keep sanitizer runs clean from extra noise.
