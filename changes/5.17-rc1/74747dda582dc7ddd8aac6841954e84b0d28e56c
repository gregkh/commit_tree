media: lirc: always send timeout reports

Without timeout reports, it is impossible to decode many protocols since
it is not known when the transmission ends. timeout reports are sent by
default, but can be turned off. There is no reason to turn them off, and
I cannot find any software which does this, so we can safely remove it.

This makes the ioctl LIRC_SET_REC_TIMEOUT_REPORTS a no-op.
