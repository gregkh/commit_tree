serial: sh-sci: Drop support for "sci_ick" clock

Since commit 1b463bd51042927e ("ARM: dts: r8a7794: Rename the serial
port clock to fck") in v4.6, all upstream DTS files call the SCIF
functional clock "fck".

Hence the time is ripe to drop backward-compatibility with old DTBs that
use the old "sci_ick" name.
