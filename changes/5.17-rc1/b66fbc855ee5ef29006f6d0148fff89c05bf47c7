staging: r8188eu: move linked status check from hal to rtw_mlme_ext

Move rtl8188e_sreset_linked_status_check from the hal layer into
rtw_mlme_ext.c.

Like the xmit status check, this is a simple function that's only
called from one place.

With this function gone, hal/rtl8188e_sreset.c and
include/rtl8188e_sreset.h are now empty and can be removed.
