net: phy: micrel: Add config_init for LAN8814

Add config_init for LAN8814. This function is required for the following
reasons:
- we need to make sure that the PHY is reset,
- disable ANEG with QSGMII PCS Host side
- swap the MDI-X A,B transmit so that there will not be any link flip-flaps
  when the PHY gets a link.
