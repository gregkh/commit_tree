watchdog: s3c2410: Fail probe if can't find valid timeout

Driver can't work properly if there no valid timeout was found in
s3c2410wdt_set_heartbeat(). Ideally, that function should be reworked in
a way that it's always able to find some valid timeout. As a temporary
solution let's for now just fail the driver probe in case the valid
timeout can't be found in s3c2410wdt_set_heartbeat() function.
