iomap: add a IOMAP_DAX flag

Add a flag so that the file system can easily detect DAX operations
based just on the iomap operation requested instead of looking at
inode state using IS_DAX.  This will be needed to apply the to be
added partition offset only for operations that actually use DAX,
but not things like fiemap that are based on the block device.
In the long run it should also allow turning the bdev, dax_dev
and inline_data into a union.
