cifs: fix hang on cifs_get_next_mid()

Mount will hang if using SMB1 and DFS.

This is because every call to get_next_mid() will, unconditionally,
mark tcpStatus to CifsNeedReconnect before even establishing the
initial connect, because "reconnect" variable was not initialized.

Initializing "reconnect" to false fix this issue.
