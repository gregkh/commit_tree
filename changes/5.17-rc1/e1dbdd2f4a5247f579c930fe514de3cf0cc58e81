platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Add lid_logo_dot to the list of safe LEDs

There have been various bugs / forum threads about allowing control of
the LED in the ThinkPad logo on the lid of various models.

This seems to be something which users want to control and there really
is no reason to require setting CONFIG_THINKPAD_ACPI_UNSAFE_LEDS for this.

The lid-logo-dot is LED number 10, so change the name of the 10th led
from unknown_led2 to lid_logo_dot and add it to the TPACPI_SAFE_LEDS mask.
