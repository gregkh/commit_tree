arm64: remove __dma_*_area() aliases

The __dma_inv_area() and __dma_clean_area() aliases make cache.S harder
to navigate, but don't gain us anything in practice.

For clarity, let's remove them along with their redundant comments. The
only users are __dma_map_area() and __dma_unmap_area(), which need to be
position independent, and can call __pi_dcache_inval_poc() and
__pi_dcache_clean_poc() directly.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
