net/mlx5: CT: Set flow source hint from provided tuple device

Get originating device from tuple offload metadata match ingress_ifindex,
and set flow_source hint to either LOCAL for vf/sf reps, UPLINK for
uplink/wire/tunnel devices/bond, or ANY (as before this patch)
for all others.

This allows lower layer (software steering or firmware) to insert the tuple
rule only in one table (either rx or tx) instead of two (rx and tx).
