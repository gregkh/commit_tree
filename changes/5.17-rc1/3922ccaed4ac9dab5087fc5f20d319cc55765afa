arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Support Homestar rev4

Support Homestar rev4 board where Parade ps8640 is added as the
second source edp bridge.

Support different edp bridge chips in different board revisions,
now we move the #incldue line of the edp bridge dts fragment (e.g.
sc7180-trogdor-ti-sn65dsi86.dtsi) from "sc7180-trogdor-homestar.dtsi"
to per-board-rev dts files.

Since the edp bridge dts fragment overrides 'dsi0_out', which is
defined in "sc7180.dtsi", move the #incldue line of "sc7180.dtsi" from
"sc7180-trogdor-homestar.dtsi" to per-board-rev dts files too, before
the #include line of the edp bridge dts fragment.
