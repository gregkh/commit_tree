ASoC: SOF: utils: Add generic function to get the reply for a tx message

The code to get the reply for a tx is identical in all but one place:
imx8_get_reply(), imx8m_get_reply(), atom_get_reply(), bdw_get_reply().

hda_dsp_ipc_get_reply() have additional check in place for PROBES and
special handling of PM messages.

Add a generic implementation to the core which can be used as drop in
replacement.

The reply size check is changed to be able to handle cases when the reply
size is not know beforehand (this is the case for PROBES and
DEBUG_MEM_USAGE for example).
