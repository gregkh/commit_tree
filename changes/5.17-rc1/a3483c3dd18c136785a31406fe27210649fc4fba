powerpc/code-patching: Fix unmap_patch_area() error handling

pXd_offset() doesn't return NULL. When the base is NULL, it
still adds the offset.

Use pXd_none() to check validity instead. It also improves
performance by folding out none existing levels as pXd_none()
always returns 0 in that case.

Such an error is unexpected, use WARN_ON() so that the caller
doesn't have to worry about it, and drop the returned value.

And now that unmap_patch_area() doesn't return error, we can
take into account the error returned by __patch_instruction().

While at it, remove the 'inline' property which is useless.
