iwlwifi: mvm: optionally suppress assert log

Normally, when we hit an assert, we print out all the
assert data. However, in certain tests, when we trigger
it from debugfs intentionally, that can be useless and
confusing.

Allow writing the string "nolog\n" to the fw_nmi and
fw_restart files suppressing the assert dump as well
as - in the case of fw_restart - the

  iwlwifi 0000:00:00.0: FW error in SYNC CMD REPLY_ERROR

message.
