drm/dp: reuse the 8b/10b link training delay helpers

Reuse the 8b/10b link training delay helpers. Functionally this skips
the check for invalid values for DPCD 1.4 and later at clock recovery
delay (as it's a fixed delay and bypasses the rd_interval) but the same
value will be checked and invalid values reported at channel
equalization.
