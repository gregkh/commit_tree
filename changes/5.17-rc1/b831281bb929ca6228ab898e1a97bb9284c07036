reiserfs: don't use congestion_wait()

Block devices do not, in general, report congestion any more, so this
congestion_wait() is effectively just a sleep.

It isn't entirely clear what is being waited for, but as we only wait
when j_async_throttle is elevated, it seems reasonable to stop waiting
when j_async_throttle becomes zero - or after the same timeout.

So change to use wait_event_event_timeout() for waiting, and
wake_up_var() to signal an end to waiting.
