ath10k: drop beacon and probe response which leak from other channel

When scan request on channel 1, it also receive beacon from other
channels, and the beacon also indicate to mac80211 and wpa_supplicant,
and then the bss info appears in radio measurement report of radio
measurement sent from wpa_supplicant, thus lead RRM case fail.

This is to drop the beacon and probe response which is not the same
channel of scanning.
