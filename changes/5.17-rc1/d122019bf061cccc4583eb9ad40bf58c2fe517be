mm: Split slab into its own type

Make struct slab independent of struct page. It still uses the
underlying memory in struct page for storing slab-specific data, but
slab and slub can now be weaned off using struct page directly.  Some of
the wrapper functions (slab_address() and slab_order()) still need to
cast to struct folio, but this is a significant disentanglement.

[ vbabka@suse.cz: Rebase on folios, use folio instead of page where
  possible.

  Do not duplicate flags field in struct slab, instead make the related
  accessors go through slab_folio(). For testing pfmemalloc use the
  folio_*_active flag accessors directly so the PageSlabPfmemalloc
  wrappers can be removed later.

  Make folio_slab() expect only folio_test_slab() == true folios and
  virt_to_slab() return NULL when folio_test_slab() == false.

  Move struct slab to mm/slab.h.

  Don't represent with struct slab pages that are not true slab pages,
  but just a compound page obtained directly rom page allocator (with
  large kmalloc() for SLUB and SLOB). ]
