btrfs: move btrfs_truncate_inode_items to inode-item.c

This is an inode item related manipulation with a few vfs related
adjustments.  I'm going to remove the vfs related code from this helper
and simplify it a lot, but I want those changes to be easily seen via
git blame, so move this function now and then the simplification work
can be done.
