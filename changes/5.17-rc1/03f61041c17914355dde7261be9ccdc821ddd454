skbuff: Switch structure bounds to struct_group()

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally writing across neighboring fields.

Replace the existing empty member position markers "headers_start" and
"headers_end" with a struct_group(). This will allow memcpy() and sizeof()
to more easily reason about sizes, and improve readability.

"pahole" shows no size nor member offset changes to struct sk_buff.
"objdump -d" shows no object code changes (outside of WARNs affected by
source line number changes).
