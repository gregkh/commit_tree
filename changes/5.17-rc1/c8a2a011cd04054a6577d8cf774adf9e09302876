net: dsa: sja1105: fix broken connection with the sja1110 tagger

The driver was incorrectly converted assuming that "sja1105" is the only
tagger supported by this driver. This results in SJA1110 switches
failing to probe:

sja1105 spi1.0: Unable to connect to tag protocol "sja1110": -EPROTONOSUPPORT
sja1105: probe of spi1.2 failed with error -93

Add DSA_TAG_PROTO_SJA1110 to the list of supported taggers by the
sja1105 driver. The sja1105_tagger_data structure format is common for
the two tagging protocols.
