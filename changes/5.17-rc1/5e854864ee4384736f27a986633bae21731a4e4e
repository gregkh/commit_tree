KVM: x86: Handle 32-bit wrap of EIP for EMULTYPE_SKIP with flat code seg

Truncate the new EIP to a 32-bit value when handling EMULTYPE_SKIP as the
decode phase does not truncate _eip.  Wrapping the 32-bit boundary is
legal if and only if CS is a flat code segment, but that check is
implicitly handled in the form of limit checks in the decode phase.

Opportunstically prepare for a future fix by storing the result of any
truncation in "eip" instead of "_eip".
