net: netvsc: Add Isolation VM support for netvsc driver

In Isolation VM, all shared memory with host needs to mark visible
to host via hvcall. vmbus_establish_gpadl() has already done it for
netvsc rx/tx ring buffer. The page buffer used by vmbus_sendpacket_
pagebuffer() stills need to be handled. Use DMA API to map/umap
these memory during sending/receiving packet and Hyper-V swiotlb
bounce buffer dma address will be returned. The swiotlb bounce buffer
has been masked to be visible to host during boot up.

rx/tx ring buffer is allocated via vzalloc() and they need to be
mapped into unencrypted address space(above vTOM) before sharing
with host and accessing. Add hv_map/unmap_memory() to map/umap rx
/tx ring buffer.
