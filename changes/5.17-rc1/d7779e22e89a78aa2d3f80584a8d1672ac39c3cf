crypto: ux500 - Use platform_get_irq() to get the interrupt

platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_IRQ, ..) relies on static
allocation of IRQ resources in DT core code, this causes an issue
when using hierarchical interrupt domains using "interrupts" property
in the node as this bypasses the hierarchical setup and messes up the
irq chaining.

In preparation for removal of static setup of IRQ resource from DT core
code use platform_get_irq() so that interrupt mapping is created on demand.

While at it also store the IRQ number in struct cryp_device_data so that
we don't have to call platform_get_irq() frequently.
