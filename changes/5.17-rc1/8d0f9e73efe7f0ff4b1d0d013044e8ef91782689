perf/bpf_counter: Use bpf_map_create instead of bpf_create_map

bpf_create_map is deprecated. Replace it with bpf_map_create. Also add a
__weak bpf_map_create() so that when older version of libbpf is linked as
a shared library, it falls back to bpf_create_map().

Fixes: 992c4225419a ("libbpf: Unify low-level map creation APIs w/ new bpf_map_create()")
