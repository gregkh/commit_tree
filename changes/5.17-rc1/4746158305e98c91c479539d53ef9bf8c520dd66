selftests/bpf: Add a dedup selftest with equivalent structure types

Without previous libbpf patch, the following error will occur:

  $ ./test_progs -t btf
  ...
  do_test_dedup:FAIL:check btf_dedup failed errno:-22#13/205 btf/dedup: btf_type_tag #5, struct:FAIL

And the previous libbpf patch fixed the issue.
