media: uvcvideo: Avoid invalid memory access

If mappings points to an invalid memory, we will be invalid accessing
it. Solve it by initializing the value of the variable mapping and by
changing the order in the conditional statement (to avoid accessing
mapping->id if not needed).

Fix:
kasan: GPF could be caused by NULL-ptr deref or user memory access
general protection fault: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTI
