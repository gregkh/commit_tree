netfilter: nf_tables: add rule blob layout

This patch adds a blob layout per chain to represent the ruleset in the
packet datapath.

	size (unsigned long)
	struct nft_rule_dp
	  struct nft_expr
	  ...
        struct nft_rule_dp
          struct nft_expr
          ...
        struct nft_rule_dp (is_last=1)

The new structure nft_rule_dp represents the rule in a more compact way
(smaller memory footprint) compared to the control-plane nft_rule
structure.

The ruleset blob is a read-only data structure. The first field contains
the blob size, then the rules containing expressions. There is a trailing
rule which is used by the tracing infrastructure which is equivalent to
the NULL rule marker in the previous representation. The blob size field
does not include the size of this trailing rule marker.

The ruleset blob is generated from the commit path.

This patch reuses the infrastructure available since 0cbc06b3faba
("netfilter: nf_tables: remove synchronize_rcu in commit phase") to
build the array of rules per chain.
