s390/pci: use phys_to_virt() for AIBVs/DIBVs

The adapter and directed interrupt bit vectors need to be referenced in
the FIB with their physical not their virtual address. So use
virt_to_phys() as approrpiate.

Note: this currently doesn't fix a real bug, since virtual addresses
are indentical to physical ones.
