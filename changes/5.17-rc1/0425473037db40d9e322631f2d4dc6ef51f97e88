list: introduce list_is_head() helper and re-use it in list.h

Introduce list_is_head() in the similar (*) way as it's done for
list_entry_is_head().  Make use of it in the list.h.

*) it's done as inliner and not a macro to be aligned with other
   list_is_*() APIs; while at it, make all three to have the same
   style.
