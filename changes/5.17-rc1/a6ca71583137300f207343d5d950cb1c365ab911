libbpf: Add ability to get/set per-program load flags

Add bpf_program__flags() API to retrieve prog_flags that will be (or
were) supplied to BPF_PROG_LOAD command.

Also add bpf_program__set_extra_flags() API to allow to set *extra*
flags, in addition to those determined by program's SEC() definition.
Such flags are logically OR'ed with libbpf-derived flags.
