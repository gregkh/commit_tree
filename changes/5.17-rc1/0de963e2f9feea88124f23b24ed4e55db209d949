staging: r8188eu: remove MSG_88E call from odm_TXPowerTrackingThermalMeterInit

Remove unnecessary MSG_88E macro call from hal/odm.c, within the
function odm_TXPowerTrackingThermalMeterInit. All it does is print a
struct member, during initialization, that is then immediately set on
the following line. It is therefore surplus to requirements.
