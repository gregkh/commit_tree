nfs: Implement cache I/O by accessing the cache directly

Move NFS to using fscache DIO API instead of the old upstream I/O API as
that has been removed.  This is a stopgap solution as the intention is that
at sometime in the future, the cache will move to using larger blocks and
won't be able to store individual pages in order to deal with the potential
for data corruption due to the backing filesystem being able insert/remove
bridging blocks of zeros into its extent list[1].

NFS then reads and writes cache pages synchronously and one page at a time.

The preferred change would be to use the netfs lib, but the new I/O API can
be used directly.  It's just that as the cache now needs to track data for
itself, caching blocks may exceed page size...

This code is somewhat borrowed from my "fallback I/O" patchset[2].
