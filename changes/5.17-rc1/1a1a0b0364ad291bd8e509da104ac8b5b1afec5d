bpftool: Enable line buffering for stdout

The output of bpftool prog tracelog is currently buffered, which is
inconvenient when piping the output into other commands. A simple
tracelog | grep will typically not display anything. This patch fixes it
by enabling line buffering on stdout for the whole bpftool binary.
