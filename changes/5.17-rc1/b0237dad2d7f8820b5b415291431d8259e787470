x86/fpu: Make XFD initialization in __fpstate_reset() a function argument

vCPU threads are different from native tasks regarding to the initial XFD
value. While all native tasks follow a fixed value (init_fpstate::xfd)
established by the FPU core at boot, vCPU threads need to obey the reset
value (i.e. ZERO) defined by the specification, to meet the expectation of
the guest.

Let the caller supply an argument and adjust the host and guest related
invocations accordingly.
