drm: Move nomodeset kernel parameter to the DRM subsystem

The "nomodeset" kernel cmdline parameter is handled by the vgacon driver
but the exported vgacon_text_force() symbol is only used by DRM drivers.

It makes much more sense for the parameter logic to be in the subsystem
of the drivers that are making use of it.

Let's move the vgacon_text_force() function and related logic to the DRM
subsystem. While doing that, rename it to drm_firmware_drivers_only() and
make it return true if "nomodeset" was used and false otherwise. This is
a better description of the condition that the drivers are testing for.
