ARM: tegra: Avoid phandle indirection on Ouya

Move the default state pinmux definition into the pinmux node. There's
no need for the indirection via the phandle.

Note that the phandle indirection is kept for the EMC operating
performance point tables because they reference nodes that are defined
in an external file.
