drm/i915: Introduce new macros for i915 PTE

Certain functions within i915 uses macros that are defined for
specific architectures by the mmu, such as _PAGE_RW and _PAGE_PRESENT
(Some architectures don't even have these macros defined, like ARM64).

Instead of re-using bits defined for the CPU, we should use bits
defined for i915. This patch introduces two new 64 bit macros,
GEN8_PAGE_PRESENT and GEN8_PAGE_RW, to check for bits 0 and 1 and, to
replace all occurrences of _PAGE_RW and _PAGE_PRESENT within i915.

v2(Michael Cheng): Use GEN8_ instead of I915_
