mtd: spi-nor: core: Don't use mtd_info in the NOR's probe sequence of calls

Use NOR parameters in the probe's sequence of calls, thus
nor->params->size instead of nor->mtd.size and let the mtd_info
fields be used by the mtd calls (mtd->_erase, mtd->_read, mtd->_write).
mtd_info fields should not be used during probe because we haven't
registered mtd yet. It's safe to drop xilinx's setting of nor->mtd.size,
now that we use nor->params->size in spi_nor_set_addr_width().
