net: wwan: iosm: device trace collection using relayfs

This patch brings in support for device trace collection.
It implements relayfs interface for pushing device trace
from kernel space to user space.

Driver gets the debugfs base directory associated to WWAN
Device and creates trace_control and trace debugfs for
device tracing. Both trace_control & trace debugfs are
created under /sys/kernel/debug/wwan/wwan0/.

In order to collect device trace on trace0 interface, user
need to write 1 to trace_ctl interface.
