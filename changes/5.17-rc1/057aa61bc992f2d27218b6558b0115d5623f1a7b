KVM: VMX: Skip Posted Interrupt updates if APICv is hard disabled

Explicitly skip posted interrupt updates if APICv is disabled in all of
KVM, or if the guest doesn't have an in-kernel APIC.  The PI descriptor
is kept up-to-date if APICv is inhibited, e.g. so that re-enabling APICv
doesn't require a bunch of updates, but neither the module param nor the
APIC type can be changed on-the-fly.
