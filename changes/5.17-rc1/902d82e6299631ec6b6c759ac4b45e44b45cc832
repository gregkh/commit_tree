rcutorture: Sanitize RCUTORTURE_RDR_MASK

RCUTORTURE_RDR_MASK is currently not the bit indicated by
RCUTORTURE_RDR_SHIFT, but is instead all the bits less significant than
that one.  This is an accident waiting to happen, so this commit makes
RCUTORTURE_RDR_MASK be that one bit and adjusts uses accordingly.
