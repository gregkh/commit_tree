drm/shmem-helper: Pass GEM shmem object in public interfaces

Change all GEM SHMEM object functions that receive a GEM object
of type struct drm_gem_object to expect an object of type
struct drm_gem_shmem_object instead.

This change reduces the number of upcasts from struct drm_gem_object
by moving them into callers. The C compiler can now verify that the
GEM SHMEM functions are called with the correct type.

For consistency, the patch also renames drm_gem_shmem_free_object to
drm_gem_shmem_free. It further updates documentation for a number of
functions.

v3:
	* fix docs for drm_gem_shmem_object_free()
v2:
	* mention _object_ callbacks in docs (Daniel)
