fuse: mark inode DONT_CACHE when per inode DAX hint changes

When the per inode DAX hint changes while the file is still *opened*, it
is quite complicated and maybe fragile to dynamically change the DAX
state.

Hence mark the inode and corresponding dentries as DONE_CACHE once the
per inode DAX hint changes, so that the inode instance will be evicted
and freed as soon as possible once the file is closed and the last
reference to the inode is put. And then when the file gets reopened next
time, the new instantiated inode will reflect the new DAX state.

In summary, when the per inode DAX hint changes for an *opened* file, the
DAX state of the file won't be updated until this file is closed and
reopened later.
