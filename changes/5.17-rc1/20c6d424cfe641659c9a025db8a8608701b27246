genirq/msi: Consolidate MSI descriptor data

All non PCI/MSI usage variants have data structures in struct msi_desc with
only one member: xxx_index. PCI/MSI has a entry_nr member.

Add a common msi_index member to struct msi_desc so all implementations can
share it which allows further consolidation.
