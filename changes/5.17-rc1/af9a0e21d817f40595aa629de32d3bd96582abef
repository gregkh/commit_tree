KVM: arm64: Introduce flag shadowing TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE

We currently have to maintain a mapping the thread_info structure
at EL2 in order to be able to check the TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE flag.

In order to eventually get rid of this, start with a vcpu flag that
shadows the thread flag on each entry into the hypervisor.
