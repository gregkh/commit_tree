mmc: core: provide macro and table to match the device tree to apply quirks

This (initially empty) table allows to match quirks early based
on .compatible of the child node of some mmc/sdio interface.

This allows to add quirks based on device tree instead of having
card specific code in the host ops.

A new macro SDIO_FIXUP_COMPATIBLE makes the definition readable.

And we call mmc_fixup_device(sdio_card_init_methods) just after
where host->ops->init_card() can be optionally called.
