objtool: Add a missing comma to avoid string concatenation

Recently the kbuild robot reported two new errors:

>> lib/kunit/kunit-example-test.o: warning: objtool: .text.unlikely: unexpected end of section
>> arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.o: warning: objtool: oops_end() falls through to next function show_opcodes()

I don't know why they did not occur in my test setup but after digging
it I realized I had accidentally dropped a comma in
tools/objtool/check.c when I renamed rewind_stack_do_exit to
rewind_stack_and_make_dead.

Add that comma back to fix objtool errors.
