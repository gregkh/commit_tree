staging: r8188eu: switch the led off during deinit

When the driver is unloaded or when the system goes into standby mode,
DeInitLed871x is called to stop the led layer. In this case, we stop
the blinking worker but we do not switch the led off explicitly. On my
system, I can go into standby mode with the LED enabled.

Add a call to SwLedOff to fix this.
