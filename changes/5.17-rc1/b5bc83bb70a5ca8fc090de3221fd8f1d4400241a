clk: ingenic: Add MDMA and BDMA clocks

The Ingenic JZ4760 and JZ4770 both have an extra DMA core named BDMA
dedicated to the NAND and BCH controller, but which can also do
memory-to-memory transfers. The JZ4760 additionally has a DMA core named
MDMA dedicated to memory-to-memory transfers. The programming manual for
the JZ4770 does have a bit for a MDMA clock, but does not seem to have
the hardware wired in.

Add the BDMA and MDMA clocks to the JZ4760 CGU code, and the BDMA clock
to the JZ4770 code, so that the BDMA and MDMA controllers can be used.
