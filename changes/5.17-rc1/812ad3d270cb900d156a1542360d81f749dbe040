ethtool: stats: Use struct_group() to clear all stats at once

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memset(), avoid intentionally writing across
neighboring fields.

Add struct_group() to mark region of struct stats_reply_data that should
be initialized, which can now be done in a single memset() call.
