tty: add kernel-doc for tty_operations

tty_operations structure was already documented in a standalone comment
in the header beginning.

Move it right before the structure and reformat it so it complies to
kernel-doc. That way, we can include it in Documentation/ later in this
series.

Note that we named proc_show's parameters, so that we can reference
them in the text.
