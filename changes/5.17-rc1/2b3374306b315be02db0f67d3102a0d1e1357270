drm/bridge: sn65dsi86: ti_sn65dsi86_read_u16() __maybe_unused

When built without CONFIG_PWM there are no references to
ti_sn65dsi86_read_u16(), avoid the W=1 build warning by marking the
function as __maybe_unused.

__maybe_unused is used insted of a #ifdef guard as it looks slighly
cleaner and it avoids issues if in the future other permutations of the
config options would use the function.
