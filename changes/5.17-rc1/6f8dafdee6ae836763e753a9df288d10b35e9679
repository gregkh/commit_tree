scsi: ufs: Introduce ufshcd_release_scsi_cmd()

The only functional change in this patch is that scsi_done() is now called
after ufshcd_release() and ufshcd_clk_scaling_update_busy() instead of
before.

The next patch in this series will introduce a call to
ufshcd_release_scsi_cmd() in the abort handler.
