ALSA/ASoC: hda: move/rename snd_hdac_ext_stop_streams to hdac_stream.c

snd_hdac_ext_stop_streams() has really nothing to do with the
extension, it just loops over the bus streams.

Move it to the hdac_stream layer and rename to remove the 'ext'
prefix and add the precision that the chip will also be stopped.
