serial: amba-pl011: do not request memory region twice

With commit 3873e2d7f63a ("drivers: PL011: refactor pl011_probe()") the
function devm_ioremap() called from pl011_setup_port() was replaced with
devm_ioremap_resource(). Since this function not only remaps but also
requests the ports io memory region it now collides with the .config_port()
callback which requests the same region at uart port registration.

Since devm_ioremap_resource() already claims the memory successfully, the
request in .config_port() fails.

Later at uart port deregistration the attempt to release the unclaimed
memory also fails. The failure results in a â€œTrying to free nonexistent
resource" warning.

Fix these issues by removing the callbacks that implement the redundant
memory allocation/release. Also make sure that changing the drivers io
memory base address via TIOCSSERIAL is not allowed any more.
