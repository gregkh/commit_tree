usb: dwc3: meson-g12a: fix shared reset control use

reset_control_(de)assert() calls are called on a shared reset line when
reset_control_reset has been used. This is not allowed by the reset
framework.

Use reset_control_rearm() call in suspend() and remove() as a way to state
that the resource is no longer used, hence the shared reset line
may be triggered again by other devices. Use reset_control_rearm() also in
case probe fails after reset() has been called.

reset_control_rearm() keeps use of triggered_count sane in the reset
framework, use of reset_control_reset() on shared reset line should be
balanced with reset_control_rearm().
