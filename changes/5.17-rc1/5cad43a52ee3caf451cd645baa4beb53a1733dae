net: dsa: felix: add port fast age support

Add support for flushing the MAC table on a given port in the ocelot
switch library, and use this functionality in the felix DSA driver.

This operation is needed when a port leaves a bridge to become
standalone, and when the learning is disabled, and when the STP state
changes to a state where no FDB entry should be present.
