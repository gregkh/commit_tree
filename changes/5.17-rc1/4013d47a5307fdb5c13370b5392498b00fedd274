ext4: make sure to reset inode lockdep class when quota enabling fails

When we succeed in enabling some quota type but fail to enable another
one with quota feature, we correctly disable all enabled quota types.
However we forget to reset i_data_sem lockdep class. When the inode gets
freed and reused, it will inherit this lockdep class (i_data_sem is
initialized only when a slab is created) and thus eventually lockdep
barfs about possible deadlocks.
