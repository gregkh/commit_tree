kunit: tool: Default --jobs to number of CPUs

The --jobs parameter for kunit_tool currently defaults to 8 CPUs,
regardless of the number available. For systems with significantly more
(or less), this is not as efficient. Instead, default --jobs to the
number of CPUs available to the process: while there are as many
superstitions as to exactly what the ideal jobs:CPU ratio is, this seems
sufficiently sensible to me.

A new helper function to get the default number of jobs is added:
get_default_jobs() -- this is used in kunit_tool_test instead of a
hardcoded value, or an explicit call to len(os.sched_getaffinity()), so
should be more flexible if this needs to change in the future.
