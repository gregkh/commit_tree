scsi: lpfc: Fix NPIV port deletion crash

The driver is calling schedule_timeout after the DA_ID nameserver request
and LOGO commands are issued to the fabric by the initiator virtual
endport.  These fixed delay functions are causing long delays in the
driver's worker thread when processing discovery I/Os in a serialized
fashion, which is then triggering mailbox timeout errors artificially.

To fix this, don't wait on the DA_ID request to complete and call
wait_event_timeout to allow the vport delete thread to make progress on an
event driven basis rather than fixing the wait time.
