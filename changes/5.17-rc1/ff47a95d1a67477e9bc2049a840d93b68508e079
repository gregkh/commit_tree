powerpc/mm: Move tlbcam_sz() and make it static

Building with W=1 we see a warning:
  linux/arch/powerpc/mm/nohash/fsl_book3e.c:63:15: error: no previous prototype for ‘tlbcam_sz’

tlbcam_sz() is not used outside this file, so we can make it static.
However it's only used inside #ifdef CONFIG_PPC32, so move it within
that ifdef, otherwise we would get a defined but not used error.
