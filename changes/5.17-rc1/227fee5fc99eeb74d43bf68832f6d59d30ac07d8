bus: mhi: core: Add an API for auto queueing buffers for DL channel

Add a new API "mhi_prepare_for_transfer_autoqueue" for using with client
drivers like QRTR to request MHI core to autoqueue buffers for the DL
channel along with starting both UL and DL channels.

So far, the "auto_queue" flag specified by the controller drivers in
channel definition served this purpose but this will be removed at some
point in future.
