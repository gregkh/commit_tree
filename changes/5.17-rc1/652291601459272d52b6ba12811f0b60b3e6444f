iwlwifi: mei: don't rely on the size from the shared area

If CSME is compromised, it could report a bigger queue size
in the share area and make the host perform an out of bound
access.
Instead of reading the size of the queue from the shared area,
store it in the regular context which is not accessible by CSME.

While at it, fix a small typo in an error print.
