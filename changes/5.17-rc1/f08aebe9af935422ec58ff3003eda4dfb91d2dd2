platform/x86: x86-android-tablets: Add support for preloading modules

Since the x86-android-tablets code does all it work from module_init() it
cannot use -EPROBE_DEFER to wait for e.g. interrupt providing GPIO-chips
or PMIC-cells to show up.

To make sure things will still work when some necessary resource providers
are build as module allow the per board info to specify a list of modules
to pre-load before instantiating the I2C clients.
