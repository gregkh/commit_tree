lib/scatterlist: cleanup macros into static inline functions

Convert the sg_is_chain(), sg_is_last() and sg_chain_ptr() macros
into static inline functions. There's no reason for these to be macros
and static inline are generally preferred these days.

Also introduce the SG_PAGE_LINK_MASK define so the P2PDMA work, which is
adding another bit to this mask, can do so more easily.
