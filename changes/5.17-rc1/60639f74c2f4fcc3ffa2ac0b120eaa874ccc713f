asm-generic: Prepare for riscv use of pud_alloc_one and pud_free

In the following commits, riscv will almost use the generic versions of
pud_alloc_one and pud_free but an additional check is required since those
functions are only relevant when using at least a 4-level page table, which
will be determined at runtime on riscv.

So move the content of those functions into other functions that riscv
can use without duplicating code.
