arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Include gpio.h in edp bridge dts

The edp bridge dts fragment files use the macros defined in
'dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h'.

To help us more flexibly order the #include lines of dts files in a
board-revision-specific dts file, let's include the gpio header in the
bridge dts fragment files themselves.
