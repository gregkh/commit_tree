fs: dlm: fix build with CONFIG_IPV6 disabled

This patch will surround the AF_INET6 case in sk_error_report() of dlm
with a #if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6). The field sk->sk_v6_daddr is not
defined when CONFIG_IPV6 is disabled. If CONFIG_IPV6 is disabled, the
socket creation with AF_INET6 should already fail because a runtime
check if AF_INET6 is registered. However if there is the possibility
that AF_INET6 is set as sk_family the sk_error_report() callback will
print then an invalid family type error.
