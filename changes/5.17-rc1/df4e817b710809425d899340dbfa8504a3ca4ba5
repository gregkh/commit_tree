mm: page table check

Check user page table entries at the time they are added and removed.

Allows to synchronously catch memory corruption issues related to double
mapping.

When a pte for an anonymous page is added into page table, we verify
that this pte does not already point to a file backed page, and vice
versa if this is a file backed page that is being added we verify that
this page does not have an anonymous mapping

We also enforce that read-only sharing for anonymous pages is allowed
(i.e.  cow after fork).  All other sharing must be for file pages.

Page table check allows to protect and debug cases where "struct page"
metadata became corrupted for some reason.  For example, when refcnt or
mapcount become invalid.
