iio: ms5611: Simplify IO callback parameters

The ms5611 passes &indio_dev->dev as a parameter to all its IO callbacks
only to directly cast the struct device back to struct iio_dev. And the
struct iio_dev is then only used to get the drivers state struct.

Simplify this a bit by passing the state struct directly. This makes it a
bit easier to follow what the code is doing.
