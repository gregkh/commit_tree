KVM: Resolve memslot ID via a hash table instead of via a static array

Memslot ID to the corresponding memslot mappings are currently kept as
indices in static id_to_index array.
The size of this array depends on the maximum allowed memslot count
(regardless of the number of memslots actually in use).

This has become especially problematic recently, when memslot count cap was
removed, so the maximum count is now full 32k memslots - the maximum
allowed by the current KVM API.

Keeping these IDs in a hash table (instead of an array) avoids this
problem.

Resolving a memslot ID to the actual memslot (instead of its index) will
also enable transitioning away from an array-based implementation of the
whole memslots structure in a later commit.
