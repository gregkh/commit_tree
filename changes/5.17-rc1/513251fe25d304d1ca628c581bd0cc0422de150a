s390/qdio: clarify handler logic for qdio_handle_activate_check()

qdio_handle_activate_check() tries to re-use one of the queue-specific
handlers to report that the ACTIVATE ccw has been terminated. But the
logic to select that handler is overly complex - in practice both
qdio drivers have at least one Input Queue, so we never take the other
paths.

Make things more obvious by removing this unused code, and clearly
spelling out that we re-use the Input Handler for generic error
reporting. This also paves the way for a world without queue-specific
error handlers.
