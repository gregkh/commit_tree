net/mlx5: Fix access to sf_dev_table on allocation failure

Even when SF devices are supported, the SF device table allocation
can still fail.
In such case mlx5_sf_dev_supported still reports true, but SF device
table is invalid. This can result in NULL table access.

Hence, fix it by adding NULL table check.
