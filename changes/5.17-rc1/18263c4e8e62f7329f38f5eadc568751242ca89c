random: cleanup fractional entropy shift constants

The entropy estimator is calculated in terms of 1/8 bits, which means
there are various constants where things are shifted by 3. Move these
into our pool info enum with the other relevant constants. While we're
at it, move an English assertion about sizes into a proper BUILD_BUG_ON
so that the compiler can ensure this invariant.
