media: atomisp-ov2680: Fix ov2680_write_reg() always writing 0 to 16 bit registers

The shift << 16 of the value in the code path for 16 bit values is
bogus, put_unaligned_be16() takes the lower 16 bits which will not
always be 0.

This was causing __ov2680_set_exposure() to always set the
OV2680_AGC and OV2680_TIMING_VTS registers to 0.
