spi: don't include ptp_clock_kernel.h in spi.h

Commit b42faeee718c ("spi: Add a PTP system timestamp
to the transfer structure") added an include of ptp_clock_kernel.h
to spi.h for struct ptp_system_timestamp but a forward declaration
is enough. Let's use that to limit the number of objects we have
to rebuild every time we touch networking headers.
