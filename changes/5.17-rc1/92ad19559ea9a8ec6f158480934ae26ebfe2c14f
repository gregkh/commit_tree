integrity: Do not load MOK and MOKx when secure boot be disabled

The security of Machine Owner Key (MOK) relies on secure boot. When
secure boot is disabled, EFI firmware will not verify binary code. Then
arbitrary efi binary code can modify MOK when rebooting.

This patch prevents MOK/MOKx be loaded when secure boot be disabled.
