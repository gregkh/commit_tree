RDMA/core: Let ib_find_gid() continue search even after empty entry

Currently, ib_find_gid() will stop searching after encountering the first
empty GID table entry. This behavior is wrong since neither IB nor RoCE
spec enforce tightly packed GID tables.

For example, when a valid GID entry exists at index N, and if a GID entry
is empty at index N-1, ib_find_gid() will fail to find the valid entry.

Fix it by making ib_find_gid() continue searching even after encountering
missing entries.
