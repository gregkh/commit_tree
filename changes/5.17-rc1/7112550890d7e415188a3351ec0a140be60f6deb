ASoC: amd: acp: acp-mach: Change default RT1019 amp dev id

RT1019 components was initially registered with i2c1 and i2c2 but
now changed to i2c0 and i2c1 in most of our AMD platforms. Change
default rt1019 components to 10EC1019:00 and 10EC1019:01 which is
aligned with most of AMD machines.

Any exception to rt1019 device ids in near future board design can
be handled using dmi based quirk for that machine.
