net: bridge: fix net device refcount tracking issue in error path

I left one dev_put() in br_add_if() error path and sure enough
syzbot found its way.

As the tracker is allocated in new_nbp(), we must make sure
to properly free it.

We have to call dev_put_track(dev, &p->dev_tracker) before
@p object is freed, of course. This is not an issue because
br_add_if() owns a reference on @dev.
