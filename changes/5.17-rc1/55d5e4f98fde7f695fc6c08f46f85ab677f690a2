dma-buf: st: fix error handling in test_get_fences()

The new driver incorrectly unwinds after errors, as clang points out:

drivers/dma-buf/st-dma-resv.c:295:7: error: variable 'i' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
                if (r) {
                    ^
drivers/dma-buf/st-dma-resv.c:336:9: note: uninitialized use occurs here
        while (i--)
               ^
drivers/dma-buf/st-dma-resv.c:295:3: note: remove the 'if' if its condition is always false
                if (r) {
                ^~~~~~~~
drivers/dma-buf/st-dma-resv.c:288:6: error: variable 'i' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
        if (r) {
            ^
drivers/dma-buf/st-dma-resv.c:336:9: note: uninitialized use occurs here
        while (i--)
               ^
drivers/dma-buf/st-dma-resv.c:288:2: note: remove the 'if' if its condition is always false
        if (r) {
        ^~~~~~~~
drivers/dma-buf/st-dma-resv.c:280:10: note: initialize the variable 'i' to silence this warning
        int r, i;
                ^
                 = 0

Skip cleaning up the bits that have not been allocated at this point.
