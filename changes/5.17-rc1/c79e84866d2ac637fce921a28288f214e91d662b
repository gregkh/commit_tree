net: dsa: tag_sja1105: convert to tagger-owned data

Currently, struct sja1105_tagger_data is a part of struct
sja1105_private, and is used by the sja1105 driver to populate dp->priv.

With the movement towards tagger-owned storage, the sja1105 driver
should not be the owner of this memory.

This change implements the connection between the sja1105 switch driver
and its tagging protocol, which means that sja1105_tagger_data no longer
stays in dp->priv but in ds->tagger_data, and that the sja1105 driver
now only populates the sja1105_port_deferred_xmit callback pointer.
The kthread worker is now the responsibility of the tagger.

The sja1105 driver also alters the tagger's state some more, especially
with regard to the PTP RX timestamping state. This will be fixed up a
bit in further changes.
