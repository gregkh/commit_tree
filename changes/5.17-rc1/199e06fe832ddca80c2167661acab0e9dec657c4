perf: Pull in bpf_program__get_prog_info_linear

To prepare for impending deprecation of libbpf's
bpf_program__get_prog_info_linear, pull in the function and associated
helpers into the perf codebase and migrate existing uses to the perf
copy.

Since libbpf's deprecated definitions will still be visible to perf, it
is necessary to rename perf's definitions.
