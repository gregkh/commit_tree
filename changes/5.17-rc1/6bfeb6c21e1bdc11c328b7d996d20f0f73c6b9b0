Input: ti_am335x_tsc - fix STEPCONFIG setup for Z2

The Z2 step configuration doesn't erase the SEL_INP_SWC_3_0 bit-field
before setting the ADC channel. This way its value could be corrupted by
the ADC channel selected for the Z1 coordinate.

Fixes: 8c896308feae ("input: ti_am335x_adc: use only FIFO0 and clean up a little")
