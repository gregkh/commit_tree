drm/vmwgfx: Fail to initialize on broken configs

Some of our hosts have a bug where rescaning a pci bus results in stale
fifo memory being mapped on the host. This makes any fifo communication
impossible resulting in various kernel crashes.

Instead of unexpectedly crashing, predictably fail to load the driver
which will preserve the system.
