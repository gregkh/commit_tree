drm/i915: remove questionable fence optimization during copy

First of all as discussed multiple times now kernel copies *must* always
wait for all fences in a BO before actually doing the copy. This is
mandatory.

Additional to that drop the handling when there can't be a shared slot
allocated on the source BO and just properly return an error code.
Otherwise this code path would only be tested under out of memory
conditions.
