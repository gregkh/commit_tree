KVM: stats: Add stat to detect if vcpu is currently blocking

Add a "blocking" stat that userspace can use to detect the case where a
vCPU is not being run because of an vCPU/guest action, e.g. HLT or WFS on
x86, WFI on arm64, etc...  Current guest/host/halt stats don't show this
well, e.g. if a guest halts for a long period of time then the vCPU could
could appear pathologically blocked due to a host condition, when in
reality the vCPU has been put into a not-runnable state by the guest.
