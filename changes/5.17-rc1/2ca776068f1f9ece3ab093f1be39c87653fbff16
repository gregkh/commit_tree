drm/i915/gtt: flush the scratch page

The scratch page is directly visible in the users address space, and
while this is forced as CACHE_LLC, by the kernel, we still have to
contend with things like "Bypass-LLC" MOCS. So just flush no matter
what.

v2(Thomas):
  - Make sure we use drm_clflush_virt_range here, in case clflush support
    is missing.
