objtool: Add straight-line-speculation validation

Teach objtool to validate the straight-line-speculation constraints:

 - speculation trap after indirect calls
 - speculation trap after RET

Notable: when an instruction is annotated RETPOLINE_SAFE, indicating
  speculation isn't a problem, also don't care about sls for that
  instruction.
