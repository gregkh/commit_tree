arm64: Make some stacktrace functions private

Now that open-coded stack unwinds have been converted to
arch_stack_walk(), we no longer need to expose any of unwind_frame(),
walk_stackframe(), or start_backtrace() outside of stacktrace.c.

Make those functions private to stacktrace.c, removing their prototypes
from <asm/stacktrace.h> and marking them static.
