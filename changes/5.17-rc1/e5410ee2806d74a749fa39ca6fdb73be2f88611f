KVM: selftests: aarch64: Cmdline arg to set number of IRQs in vgic_irq test

Add the ability to specify the number of vIRQs exposed by KVM (arg
defaults to 64). Then extend the KVM_IRQ_LINE test by injecting all
available SPIs at once (specified by the nr-irqs arg). As a bonus,
inject all SGIs at once as well.
