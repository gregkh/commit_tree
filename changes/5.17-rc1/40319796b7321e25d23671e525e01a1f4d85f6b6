ice: Add flow director support for channel mode

Add support to enable flow-director filter when multiple TCs are
configured. Flow director filter can be configured using ethtool
(--config-ntuple option). When multiple TCs are configured, each
TC is mapped to an unique HW VSI. So VSI corresponding to queue
used in filter is identified and flow director context is updated
with correct VSI while configuring ntuple filter in HW.
