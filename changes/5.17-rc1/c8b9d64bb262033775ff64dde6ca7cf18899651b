arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: add QFPROM chipset specific compatible

Use correct compatible according to dt-binding.

Fixes + few other lines of `make qcom/sdm845-oneplus-fajita.dtb`:
arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sdm845-oneplus-fajita.dt.yaml: qfprom@784000: compatible: ['qcom,qfprom'] is too short
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/nvmem/qcom,qfprom.yaml
