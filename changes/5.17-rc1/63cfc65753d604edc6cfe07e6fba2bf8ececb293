net: dsa: don't enumerate dsa_switch and dsa_port bit fields using commas

This is a cosmetic incremental fixup to commits
7787ff776398 ("net: dsa: merge all bools of struct dsa_switch into a single u32")
bde82f389af1 ("net: dsa: merge all bools of struct dsa_port into a single u8")

The desire to make this change was enunciated after posting these
patches here:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/cover/20220105132141.2648876-1-vladimir.oltean@nxp.com/

but due to a slight timing overlap (message posted at 2:28 p.m. UTC,
merge commit is at 2:46 p.m. UTC), that comment was missed and the
changes were applied as-is.
