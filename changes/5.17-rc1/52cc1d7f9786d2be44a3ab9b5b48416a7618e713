PM: core: Remove static qualifier in DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS macro

Keep this macro in line with the other ones. This makes it possible to
use them in the cases where the underlying dev_pm_ops structure is
exported.

Restore the "static" qualifier in the two drivers where the
DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS macro was used.
