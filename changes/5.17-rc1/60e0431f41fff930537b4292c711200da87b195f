habanalabs: fix soft reset accounting

Reset upon device release is not a soft-reset from user/system point
of view. As such, we shouldn't count that reset in the statistics we
gather and expose to the monitoring applications.

We also shouldn't print soft-reset when doing the reset upon device
release.
