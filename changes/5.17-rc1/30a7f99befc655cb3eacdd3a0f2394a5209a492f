arm64: dts: qcom: Add support for SONY Xperia XZ2 / XZ2C / XZ3 (Tama platform)

Add support for SONY Xperia XZ2, XZ2 Compact and XZ3 smartphones, all based on
the Qualcomm SDM845 chipset. There also exists a fourth Tama device, the XZ2
Premium (Aurora) with a 4K display, but it's relatively rare.

The devices are affected by a scary UFS behaviour where sending a certain UFS
command (which is worked around on downstream) renders the device unbootable,
by effectively erasing the bootloader. Therefore UFS AND UFSPHY are strictly
disabled for now.

Downstream workaround:

This platform's bootloader is not very nice either. To boot mainline you need
to flash a bogus DTBO (fastboot erasing may cut it, but it takes an inhumane
amount of time) - one that's just 4 bytes (all zeroes) seems to work just fine.

Of course, one can also provide a "normal" DTBO (device-specific DT overlayed
on top of the SoC DT), but that's not yet supported by the mainline kernel
build system.
