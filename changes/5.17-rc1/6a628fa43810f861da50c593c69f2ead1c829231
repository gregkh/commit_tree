fs: dlm: fix potential buffer overflow

This patch fixes an potential overflow in sscanf and the maximum
declared string parsing length which seems to be excluding the null
termination symbol. This patch will just add one byte to be prepared on
a string with length of DLM_RESNAME_MAXLEN including the null
termination symbol.
