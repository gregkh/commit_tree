interconnect: icc-rpm: Add QNOC type QoS support

It adds QoS support for QNOC type device which can be found on QCM2290
platform.  The downstream driver[1] includes support for priority,
limiter, regulator and forwarding setup.  As QCM2290 support only
requires priority and forwarding configuration, limiter and regulator
support are omitted for this initial submission.
