RISC-V: Move spinwait booting method to its own config

The spinwait booting method should only be used for platforms with older
firmware without SBI HSM extension or M-mode firmware because spinwait
method can't support cpu hotplug, kexec or sparse hartid. It is better
to move the entire spinwait implementation to its own config which can
be disabled if required. It is enabled by default to maintain backward
compatibility and M-mode Linux.
