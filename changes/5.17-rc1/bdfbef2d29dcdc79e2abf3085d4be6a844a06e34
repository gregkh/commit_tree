pinctrl: cherryview: Don't use selection 0 to mark an interrupt line as unused

The selection 0 is a perfectly valid, so stop using it to have
the special meaning of interrupt line not used in the intr_lines.

Instead introduce a special CHV_INVALID_HWIRQ value, derived
from INVALID_HWIRQ. which is never a valid selection and use
that to indicate unused interrupt lines.
