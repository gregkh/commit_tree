can: softing: softing_startstop(): fix set but not used variable warning

In the function softing_startstop() the variable error_reporting is
assigned but not used. The code that uses this variable is commented
out. Its stated that the functionality is not finally verified.

To fix the warning:

| drivers/net/can/softing/softing_fw.c:424:9: error: variable 'error_reporting' set but not used [-Werror,-Wunused-but-set-variable]

remove the comment, activate the code, but add a "0 &&" to the if
expression and rely on the optimizer rather than the preprocessor to
remove the code.
