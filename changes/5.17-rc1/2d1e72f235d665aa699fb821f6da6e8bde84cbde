hinic: Use irq_set_affinity_and_hint()

The driver uses irq_set_affinity_hint() to:

 - Set the affinity_hint which is consumed by the userspace for
   distributing the interrupts

 - Enforce affinity

As per commit 352f58b0d9f2 ("net-next/hinic: Set Rxq irq to specific cpu
for NUMA"), the hinic driver enforces its own affinity to bind IRQs to the
local NUMA node. However, irq_set_affinity_hint() applying the provided
cpumask as an affinity for the interrupt is an undocumented side effect.

To remove this side effect irq_set_affinity_hint() has been marked as
deprecated and new interfaces have been introduced. Hence, replace the
irq_set_affinity_hint() with the new interface irq_set_affinity_and_hint()
where the provided mask needs to be applied as the affinity and
affinity_hint pointer needs to be set and replace with
irq_update_affinity_hint() where only affinity_hint needs to be updated.
