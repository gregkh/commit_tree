MAINTAINERS: bd70528: Drop ROHM BD70528 drivers

The only known BD70528 use-cases are such that the PMIC is controlled
from separate MCU which is not running Linux. I am not aware of
any Linux driver users. Furthermore, it seems there is no demand for
this IC.

Ease the maintenance burden and drop the driver.
