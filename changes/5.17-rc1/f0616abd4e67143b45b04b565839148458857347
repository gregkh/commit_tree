arm64: clear_page() shouldn't use DC ZVA when DCZID_EL0.DZP == 1

Currently, clear_page() uses DC ZVA instruction unconditionally.  But it
should make sure that DCZID_EL0.DZP, which indicates whether or not use
of DC ZVA instruction is prohibited, is zero when using the instruction.
Use STNP instead when DCZID_EL0.DZP == 1.
