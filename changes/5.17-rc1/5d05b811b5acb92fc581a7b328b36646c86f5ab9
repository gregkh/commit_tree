of: base: Improve argument length mismatch error

The cells_name field of of_phandle_iterator might be NULL. Use the
phandle name instead. With this change instead of:

  OF: /soc/pinctrl@1000000: (null) = 3 found 2

We get:

  OF: /soc/pinctrl@1000000: phandle pinctrl@1000000 needs 3, found 2

Which is a more helpful messages making DT debugging easier.

In this particular example the phandle name looks like duplicate of the
same node name. But note that the first node is the parent node
(it->parent), while the second is the phandle target (it->node). They
happen to be the same in the case that triggered this improvement. See
commit 72cb4c48a46a ("arm64: dts: qcom: ipq6018: Fix gpio-ranges
property").
