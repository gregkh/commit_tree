exit: Move oops specific logic from do_exit into make_task_dead

The beginning of do_exit has become cluttered and difficult to read as
it is filled with checks to handle things that can only happen when
the kernel is operating improperly.

Now that we have a dedicated function for cleaning up a task when the
kernel is operating improperly move the checks there.
