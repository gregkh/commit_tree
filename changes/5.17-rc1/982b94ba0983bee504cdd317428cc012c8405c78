driver core: Don't call device_remove_properties() from device_del()

All the drivers that relied on device_del() to call
device_remove_properties() have now been converted to either
use device_create_managed_software_node() instead of
device_add_properties(), or to register the software node
completely separately from the device.

This will make it finally possible to share and reuse the
software nodes that hold the additional device properties.
