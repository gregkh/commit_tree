test_hash.c: split test_hash_init

Split up test_hash_init so that it calls each test more explicitly
insofar it is possible without rewriting the entire file.  This aims at
improving readability.

Split tests performed on string_or as they don't interfere with those
performed in hash_or.  Also separate pr_info calls about skipped tests
as they're not part of the tests themselves, but only warn about
(un)defined arch-specific hash functions.
