hfsplus: use struct_group_attr() for memcpy() region

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memset(), avoid intentionally writing across
neighboring fields.

Add struct_group() to mark the "info" region (containing struct DInfo
and struct DXInfo structs) in struct hfsplus_cat_folder and struct
hfsplus_cat_file that are written into directly, so the compiler can
correctly reason about the expected size of the writes.

"pahole" shows no size nor member offset changes to struct
hfsplus_cat_folder nor struct hfsplus_cat_file.  "objdump -d" shows no
object code changes.
