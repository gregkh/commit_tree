drm/i915/hdmi: Introduce intel_hdmi_is_ycbr420()

Introduce a small helper which given the crtc state tells us
whether we're output YCbCr 4:2:0 or not. For native HDMI this
is rather simple as we just look at the output_format. But I
think the helper is beneficial since with DP HDMI DFPs we're
going to need a more complex variant, and I want to unify the
DP and HDMI sides of that as much as possible.
