KVM: Use "new" memslot's address space ID instead of dedicated param

Now that the address space ID is stored in every slot, including fake
slots used for deletion, use the slot's as_id instead of passing in the
redundant information as a param to kvm_set_memslot().  This will greatly
simplify future memslot work by avoiding passing a large number of
variables around purely to honor @as_id.

Drop a comment in the DELETE path about new->as_id being provided purely
for debug, as that's now a lie.

No functional change intended.
