can: etas_es58x: es58x_init_netdev: populate net_device::dev_port

The field dev_port of struct net_device indicates the port number of a
network device [1]. This patch populates this field.

This field can be helpful to distinguish between the two network
interfaces of a dual channel device (i.e. ES581.4 or ES582.1). Indeed,
at the moment, all the network interfaces of a same device share the
same static udev attributes c.f. output of:

| udevadm info --attribute-walk /sys/class/net/canX

The dev_port attribute can then be used to write some udev rules to,
for example, assign a permanent name to each network interface based
on the serial/dev_port pair (which is convenient when you have a test
bench with several CAN devices connected simultaneously and wish to
keep consistent interface names upon reboot).
