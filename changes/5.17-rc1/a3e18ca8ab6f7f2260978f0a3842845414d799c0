KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Demand fault EBB facility registers

Use HFSCR facility disabling to implement demand faulting for EBB, with
a hysteresis counter similar to the load_fp etc counters in context
switching that implement the equivalent demand faulting for userspace
facilities.

This speeds up guest entry/exit by avoiding the register save/restore
when a guest is not frequently using them. When a guest does use them
often, there will be some additional demand fault overhead, but these
are not commonly used facilities.
