powerpc/83xx: Add __init attribute to eligible functions

Some functions defined in 'arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx' are deserving of an
`__init` macro attribute. These functions are only called by other
initialization functions and therefore should inherit the attribute.
Also, change function declarations in header files to include `__init`.
