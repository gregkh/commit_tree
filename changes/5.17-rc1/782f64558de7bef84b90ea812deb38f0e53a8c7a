KVM: SVM: Skip AVIC and IRTE updates when loading blocking vCPU

Don't bother updating the Physical APIC table or IRTE when loading a vCPU
that is blocking, i.e. won't be marked IsRun{ning}=1, as the pCPU is
queried if and only if IsRunning is '1'.  If the vCPU was migrated, the
new pCPU will be picked up when avic_vcpu_load() is called by
svm_vcpu_unblocking().
