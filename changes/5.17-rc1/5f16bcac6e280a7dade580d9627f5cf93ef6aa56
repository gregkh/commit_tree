KVM: x86/mmu: Document and enforce MMU-writable and Host-writable invariants

SPTEs are tagged with software-only bits to indicate if it is
"MMU-writable" and "Host-writable". These bits are used to determine why
KVM has marked an SPTE as read-only.

Document these bits and their invariants, and enforce the invariants
with new WARNs in spte_can_locklessly_be_made_writable() to ensure they
are not accidentally violated in the future.

Opportunistically move DEFAULT_SPTE_{MMU,HOST}_WRITABLE next to
EPT_SPTE_{MMU,HOST}_WRITABLE since the new documentation applies to
both.

No functional change intended.
