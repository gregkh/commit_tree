exit: Rename module_put_and_exit to module_put_and_kthread_exit

Update module_put_and_exit to call kthread_exit instead of do_exit.

Change the name to reflect this change in functionality.  All of the
users of module_put_and_exit are causing the current kthread to exit
so this change makes it clear what is happening.  There is no
functional change.
