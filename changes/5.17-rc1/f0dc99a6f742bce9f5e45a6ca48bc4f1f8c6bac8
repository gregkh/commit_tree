drm/amdkfd: add kfd_device_info_init function

Initializes kfd->device_info given either asic_type (enum) if GFX
version is less than GFX9, or GC IP version if greater. Also takes in vf
and the target compiler gfx version. Uses SDMA version to determine
num_sdma_queues_per_engine.

Convert device_info to a non-pointer member of kfd, change references
accordingly.

Change unsupported asic condition to only probe f2g, move device_info
initialization post-switch.
