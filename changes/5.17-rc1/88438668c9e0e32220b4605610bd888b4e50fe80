drm/bridge: lvds-codec: Add support for pixel data sampling edge select

The OnSemi FIN3385 Parallel-to-LVDS encoder has a dedicated input line to
select input pixel data sampling edge. Add DT property "pclk-sample", not
the same as the one used by display timings but rather the same as used by
media, and configure bus flags based on this DT property.
