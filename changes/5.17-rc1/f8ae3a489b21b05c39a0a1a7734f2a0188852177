vdpa/mlx5: Fix is_index_valid() to refer to features

Make sure the decision whether an index received through a callback is
valid or not consults the negotiated features.

The motivation for this was due to a case encountered where I shut down
the VM. After the reset operation was called features were already
clear, I got get_vq_state() call which caused out array bounds
access since is_index_valid() reported the index value.

So this is more of not hit a bug since the call shouldn't have been made
first place.
