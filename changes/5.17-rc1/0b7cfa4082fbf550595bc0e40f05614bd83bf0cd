net/mlx5e: Fix page DMA map/unmap attributes

Driver initiates DMA sync, hence it may skip CPU sync. Add
DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC as input attribute both to dma_map_page and
dma_unmap_page to avoid redundant sync with the CPU.
When forcing the device to work with SWIOTLB, the extra sync might cause
data corruption. The driver unmaps the whole page while the hardware
used just a part of the bounce buffer. So syncing overrides the entire
page with bounce buffer that only partially contains real data.
