HID: Ignore battery for Elan touchscreen on HP Envy X360 15t-dr100

Battery status on Elan tablet driver is reported for the HP ENVY x360
15t-dr100. There is no separate battery for the Elan controller resulting in a
battery level report of 0% or 1% depending on whether a stylus has interacted
with the screen. These low battery level reports causes a variety of bad
behavior in desktop environments. This patch adds the appropriate quirk to
indicate that the batery status is unused for this target.
