hwmon: (tmp401) Simplify temperature register arrays

The difference between TMP431 and other chips of this series is that the
TMP431 has an additional sensor. The register addresses for other sensors
are the same for all chips. It is therefore unnecessary to maintain two
different arrays for TMP431 and the other chips. Just use the same array
for all chips and add the TMP431 register addresses as third column.
