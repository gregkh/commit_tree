drm/i915/dg2: Add Wa_16013000631

Invalidate IC cache through pipe control command as part of the ctx
restore flow through indirect ctx pointer.

v2:
 - Move pipe control from xcs indirect context to the rcs indirect
   context.  We'll eventually need this on the CCS engines too, but
   support for those hasn't landed yet.
