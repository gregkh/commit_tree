ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: correct pcmif BE dai control flow

Originally, the conditions for preventing reentry are not correct.
dai->component->active is not the state specifically for pcmif dai, so it
is not a correct condition to indicate the status of pcmif dai.
On the other hand, snd_soc_dai_stream_actvie() in prepare ops for both
playback and capture possibly return true at the first entry when these
two streams are opened at the same time.

In the patch, I refer to the implementation in mt8192-dai-pcm.c.
Clock and enabling bit for PCMIF are managed by DAPM, and the condition
for prepare ops is replaced by the status of dai widget.
