staging: greybus: fix stack size warning with UBSAN

clang warns about excessive stack usage in this driver when
UBSAN is enabled:

drivers/staging/greybus/audio_topology.c:977:12: error: stack frame size of 1836 bytes in function 'gbaudio_tplg_create_widget' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

Rework this code to no longer use compound literals for
initializing the structure in each case, but instead keep
the common bits in a preallocated constant array and copy
them as needed.
