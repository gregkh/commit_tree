bpf, x64: Replace some stack_size usage with offset variables

As suggested by Andrii, adding variables for registers and ip
address offsets, which makes the code more clear, rather than
abusing single stack_size variable for everything.

Also describing the stack layout in the comment.

There is no function change.
