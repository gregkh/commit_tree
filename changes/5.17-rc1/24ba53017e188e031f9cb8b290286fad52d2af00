rcu: Replace ________p1 and _________p1 with __UNIQUE_ID(rcu)

This commit replaces both ________p1 and _________p1 with __UNIQUE_ID(rcu),
and also adjusts the callers of the affected macros.

__UNIQUE_ID(rcu) will generate unique variable names during compilation,
which eliminates the need of ________p1 and _________p1 (both having 4
occurrences prior to the code change).  This also avoids the variable
name shadowing issue, or at least makes those wishing to cause shadowing
problems work much harder to do so.

The same idea is used for the min/max macros (commit 589a978 and commit
e9092d0).
