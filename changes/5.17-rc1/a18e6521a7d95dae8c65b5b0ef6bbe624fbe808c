net: phylink: handle NA interface mode in phylink_fwnode_phy_connect()

Commit 4904b6ea1f9db ("net: phy: phylink: Use PHY device interface if
N/A") introduced handling for the phy interface mode where this is not
known at phylink creation time. This was never added to the OF/fwnode
paths, but is necessary when the phy is present in DT, but the phy-mode
is not specified.

Add this handling.
