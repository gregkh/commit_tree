media: venus: core: Fix a resource leak in the error handling path of 'venus_probe()'

A successful 'of_platform_populate()' call should be balanced by a
corresponding 'of_platform_depopulate()' call in the error handling path
of the probe, as already done in the remove function.

A successful 'venus_firmware_init()' call should be balanced by a
corresponding 'venus_firmware_deinit()' call in the error handling path
of the probe, as already done in the remove function.

Update the error handling path accordingly.
