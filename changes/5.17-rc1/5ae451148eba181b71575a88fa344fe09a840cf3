dt-bindings: i2c: exynos5: Convert to dtschema

Convert Samsung Exynos High Speed I2C bindings doc to DT schema format.

Changes during bindings conversion:
1. Added missing required clock properties (driver fails when it's
   unable to get the clock)
2. Removed properties and descriptions that can be found in
   schemas/i2c/i2c-controller.yaml [1]
3. Fixed the example so it can be validated by dtschema
