watchdog: s3c2410: Support separate source clock

Right now all devices supported in the driver have the single clock: it
acts simultaneously as a bus clock (providing register interface
clocking) and source clock (driving watchdog counter). Some newer Exynos
chips, like Exynos850, have two separate clocks for that. In that case
two clocks will be passed to the driver from the resource provider, e.g.
Device Tree. Provide necessary infrastructure to support that case:
  - use source clock's rate for all timer related calculations
  - use bus clock to gate/ungate the register interface

All devices that use the single clock are kept intact: if only one clock
is passed from Device Tree, it will be used for both purposes as before.
