drm/i915/clflush: fixup handling of cache_dirty

In theory if clflush_work_create() somehow fails here, and we don't yet
have mm.pages populated then we end up resetting cache_dirty, which is
likely wrong, since that will potentially skip the flush-on-acquire, if
it was needed.

It looks like intel_user_framebuffer_dirty() can arrive here before the
pages are populated.

v2(Thomas):
  - Move setting cache_dirty out of the async portion, also add a
    comment for why that should still be safe.
v3:
  - Add Thomas' irc r-b
