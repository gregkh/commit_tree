media: ipu3-cio2: Add support for instantiating i2c-clients for VCMs

Some sensors come with a variable-focus lens where the lens focus is
controller by a VCM (Voice Coil Motor). If there is a VCM for the
lens-focus, and if so which one, is described on the vcm_type field
of the ACPI SSDB table.

These VCMs are a second I2C device listed as an extra I2cSerialBusV2
resource in the same ACPI device as the sensor. The i2c-core-acpi.c
code only instantiates an i2c-client for the first I2cSerialBusV2
resource.

Add support for instantiating an i2c-client for the VCM with
the type of the i2c-client set based on the SSDB vcm_type field.
