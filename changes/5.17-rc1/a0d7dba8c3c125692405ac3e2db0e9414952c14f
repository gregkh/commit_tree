ARM: tegra: Add common device-tree for LVDS display panels of Tegra30 ASUS tablets

All Tegra30 ASUS tablets have a similar design pattern in terms of
hardware integration of LVDS display panels, like exactly the same GPIOs
are used for power and reset, etc. Add a common device-tree for LVDS
display panels of Tegra30 ASUS tablets to avoid replicating the
boilerplate panel description.

[digetx@gmail.com: factored out common part into separate patch and wrote commit message]
