selftests/sgx: Fix a benign linker warning

The enclave binary (test_encl.elf) is built with only three sections (tcs,
text, and data) as controlled by its custom linker script.

If gcc is built with "--enable-linker-build-id" (this appears to be a
common configuration even if it is by default off) then gcc
will pass "--build-id" to the linker that will prompt it (the linker) to
write unique bits identifying the linked file to a ".note.gnu.build-id"
section.

The section ".note.gnu.build-id" does not exist in the test enclave
resulting in the following warning emitted by the linker:

/usr/bin/ld: warning: .note.gnu.build-id section discarded, --build-id
ignored

The test enclave does not use the build id within the binary so fix the
warning by passing a build id of "none" to the linker that will disable the
setting from any earlier "--build-id" options and thus disable the attempt
to write the build id to a ".note.gnu.build-id" section that does not
exist.
