refscale: Always log the error message

An OOM is a serious error that should be logged even in non-verbose runs.
This commit therefore adds an unconditional SCALEOUT_ERRSTRING() macro
and uses it instead of VERBOSE_SCALEOUT_ERRSTRING() when reporting an OOM.

[ paulmck: Drop do-while from SCALEOUT_ERRSTRING() due to only single statement. ]
