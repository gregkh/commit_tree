media: atomisp: pci: release_version is now irci_stable_candrpv_0415_20150521_0458

Now that we made atomisp work with firmware version
irci_stable_candrpv_0415_20150521_0458 also for ISP2401, the
release_version for ISP2401 is not irci_ecr-master_20150911_0724
anymore.

So, use the same release_version for both ISP2400 and ISP2401 (i.e.,
irci_stable_candrpv_0415_20150521_0458).

Referred to the following diff to make this patch:
