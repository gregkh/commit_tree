net: lan966x: Fix the vlan used by host ports

The blamed commit changed the vlan used by the host ports to be 4095
instead of 0.
Because of this change the following issues are seen:
- when the port is probed first it was adding an entry in the MAC table
  with the wrong vlan (port->pvid which is default 0) and not HOST_PVID
- when the port is removed from a bridge, it was using the wrong vlan to
  add entries in the MAC table. It was using the old PVID and not the
  HOST_PVID

This patch fixes this two issues by using the HOST_PVID instead of
port->pvid.
