clk: sunxi-ng: mp: Add macros using clk_parent_data and clk_hw

Referencing parents with clk_hw pointers is more efficient and removes
the dependency on global clock names. clk_parent_data is needed when
some parent clocks are provided from another driver. Add macros for
declaring dividers that take advantage of these.
