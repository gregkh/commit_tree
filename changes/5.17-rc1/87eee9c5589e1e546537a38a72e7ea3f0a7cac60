testptp: set pin function before other requests

When the -L option of the testptp utility is specified with other
options (e.g. -p to enable PPS output), the user probably wants to
apply it to the pin configured by the -L option.

Reorder the code to set the pin function before other function requests
to avoid confusing users.
