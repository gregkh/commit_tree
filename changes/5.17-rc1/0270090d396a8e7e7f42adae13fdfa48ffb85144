libbpf: Avoid double stores for success/failure case of ksym relocations

Instead, jump directly to success case stores in case ret >= 0, else do
the default 0 value store and jump over the success case. This is better
in terms of readability. Readjust the code for kfunc relocation as well
to follow a similar pattern, also leads to easier to follow code now.
