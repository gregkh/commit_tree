rcu: Mark sync_sched_exp_online_cleanup() ->cpu_no_qs.b.exp load

The sync_sched_exp_online_cleanup() is called from rcutree_online_cpu(),
which can be invoked with interrupts enabled.  This means that
the ->cpu_no_qs.b.exp field is subject to data races from the
rcu_exp_handler() IPI handler, so this commit marks the load from
that field.
