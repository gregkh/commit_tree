iommu/vt-d: Use correctly sized arguments for bit field

The find.h APIs are designed to be used only on unsigned long arguments.
This can technically result in a over-read, but it is harmless in this
case. Regardless, fix it to avoid the warning seen under -Warray-bounds,
which we'd like to enable globally:
