tools/memory-model: doc: Describe the requirement of the litmus-tests directory

It's better that we have some "standard" about which test should be put
in the litmus-tests directory because it helps future contributors
understand whether they should work on litmus-tests in kernel or Paul's
GitHub repo. Therefore explain a little bit on what a "representative"
litmus test is.
