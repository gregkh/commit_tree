blk-mq: Delete busy_iter_fn

Typedefs busy_iter_fn and busy_tag_iter_fn are now identical, so delete
busy_iter_fn to reduce duplication.

It would be nicer to delete busy_tag_iter_fn, as the name busy_iter_fn is
less specific.

However busy_tag_iter_fn is used in many different parts of the tree,
unlike busy_iter_fn which is just use in block/, so just take the
straightforward path now, so that we could rename later treewide.
