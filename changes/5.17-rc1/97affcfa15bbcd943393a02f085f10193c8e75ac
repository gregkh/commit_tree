wl1251: specify max. IE length

This fix is similar to commit 77c91295ea53 ("wil6210: specify max. IE
length").  Without the max IE length set, wpa_supplicant cannot operate
using the nl80211 interface.

This patch is a workaround - the number 512 is taken from the wlcore
driver, but note that per Paul Fertser:

    there's no correct number because the driver will ignore the data
    passed in extra IEs.
