cfg80211: move offchan_cac_event to a dedicated work

In order to make cfg80211_offchan_cac_abort() (renamed from
cfg80211_offchan_cac_event) callable in other contexts and
without so much locking restrictions, make it trigger a new
work instead of operating directly.

Do some other renames while at it to clarify.
