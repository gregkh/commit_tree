PCI: hv: Make the code arch neutral by adding arch specific interfaces

Encapsulate arch dependencies in Hyper-V vPCI through a set of
arch-dependent interfaces. Adding these arch specific interfaces will
allow for an implementation for other architectures, such as arm64.

There are no functional changes expected from this patch.
