mm/vmalloc: add support for __GFP_NOFAIL

Dave Chinner has mentioned that some of the xfs code would benefit from
kvmalloc support for __GFP_NOFAIL because they have allocations that
cannot fail and they do not fit into a single page.

The large part of the vmalloc implementation already complies with the
given gfp flags so there is no work for those to be done.  The area and
page table allocations are an exception to that.  Implement a retry loop
for those.

Add a short sleep before retrying.  1 jiffy is a completely random
timeout.  Ideally the retry would wait for an explicit event - e.g.  a
change to the vmalloc space change if the failure was caused by the
space fragmentation or depletion.  But there are multiple different
reasons to retry and this could become much more complex.  Keep the
retry simple for now and just sleep to prevent from hogging CPUs.
