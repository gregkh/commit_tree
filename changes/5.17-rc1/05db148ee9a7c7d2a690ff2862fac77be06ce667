libertas_tf: Add missing __packed annotations

The earlier __packed annotations added in commit d71038c05970 ("libertas:
Fix alignment issues in libertas core") were not duplicated when
libertas_af was added in commit 7670e62c7ed6 ("libertas_tf: header file"),
even though they share several structure definitions. Add the missing
annotations which commit 642a57475b30 ("libertas_tf: Use struct_group()
for memcpy() region") exposed. Quoting the prior libertas fix: "Data
structures that come over the wire from the WLAN firmware must be
packed."
