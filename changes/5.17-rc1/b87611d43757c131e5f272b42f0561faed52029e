hwmon: (asus_wmi_ec_sensors) Support B550 Asus WMI.

Linux HWMON sensors driver for ASUS motherboards to read
sensors from the embedded controller.

Many ASUS motherboards do not publish all the available
sensors via the Super I/O chip but the missing ones are
available through the embedded controller (EC) registers.

This driver implements reading those sensor data via the
WMI method BREC, which is known to be present in all ASUS
motherboards based on the AMD 500 series chipsets (and
probably is available in other models too). The driver
needs to know exact register addresses for the sensors and
thus support for each motherboard has to be added explicitly.

The EC registers do not provide critical values for the
sensors and as such they are not published to the HWMON.

Supported motherboards:
* PRIME X570-PRO
* Pro WS X570-ACE
* ROG CROSSHAIR VIII HERO
* ROG CROSSHAIR VIII DARK HERO
* ROG CROSSHAIR VIII FORMULA
* ROG STRIX X570-E GAMING
* ROG STRIX B550-I GAMING
* ROG STRIX B550-E GAMING
