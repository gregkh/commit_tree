btrfs: remove no longer needed logic for replaying directory deletes

Now that we log only dir index keys when logging a directory, we no longer
need to deal with dir item keys in the log replay code for replaying
directory deletes. This is also true for the case when we replay a log
tree created by a kernel that still logs dir items.

So remove the remaining code of the replay of directory deletes algorithm
that deals with dir item keys.
