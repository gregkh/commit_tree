KVM: Warn if mark_page_dirty() is called without an active vCPU

The various kvm_write_guest() and mark_page_dirty() functions must only
ever be called in the context of an active vCPU, because if dirty ring
tracking is enabled it may simply oops when kvm_get_running_vcpu()
returns NULL for the vcpu and then kvm_dirty_ring_get() dereferences it.

This oops was reported by "butt3rflyh4ck" <butterflyhuangxx@gmail.com> in
https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/CAFcO6XOmoS7EacN_n6v4Txk7xL7iqRa2gABg3F7E3Naf5uG94g@mail.gmail.com/

That actual bug will be fixed under separate cover but this warning
should help to prevent new ones from being added.
