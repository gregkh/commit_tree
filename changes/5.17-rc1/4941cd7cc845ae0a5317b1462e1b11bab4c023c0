ASoC: SOF: Kconfig: Make the SOF_DEVELOPER_SUPPORT depend on SND_SOC_SOF

SND_SOC_SOF_DEVELOPER_SUPPORT contains options affecting how the built
SOF driver stack will behave, enables debug options and other features.

These options have no meaning if the SND_SOC_SOF is not even enabled.

If we have SOF client options under developer_support and debug they can
be selected to be built even without the core, but they do need symbols
from the core (the sof-client API) which can result build failure.

In Kconfig we can have
SND_SOC_SOF_TOPLEVEL=y
SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG_IPC_FLOOD_TEST=y

for example, which will make the flood client to be built, but the SOF core
is not as SND_SOC_SOF is not selected.
