KVM: Don't make a full copy of the old memslot in __kvm_set_memory_region()

Stop making a full copy of the old memslot in __kvm_set_memory_region()
now that metadata updates are handled by kvm_set_memslot(), i.e. now that
the old memslot's dirty bitmap doesn't need to be referenced after the
memslot and its pointer is modified/invalidated by kvm_set_memslot().

No functional change intended.
