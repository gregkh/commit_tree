x86/boot/compressed: Move CLANG_FLAGS to beginning of KBUILD_CFLAGS

When cross compiling i386_defconfig on an arm64 host with clang, there
are a few instances of '-Waddress-of-packed-member' and
'-Wgnu-variable-sized-type-not-at-end' in arch/x86/boot/compressed/,
which should both be disabled with the cc-disable-warning calls in that
directory's Makefile, which indicates that cc-disable-warning is failing
at the point of testing these flags.

The cc-disable-warning calls fail because at the point that the flags
are tested, KBUILD_CFLAGS has '-march=i386' without $(CLANG_FLAGS),
which has the '--target=' flag to tell clang what architecture it is
targeting. Without the '--target=' flag, the host architecture (arm64)
is used and i386 is not a valid value for '-march=' in that case. This
error can be seen by adding some logging to try-run:

  clang-14: error: the clang compiler does not support '-march=i386'

Invoking the compiler has to succeed prior to calling cc-option or
cc-disable-warning in order to accurately test whether or not the flag
is supported; if it doesn't, the requested flag can never be added to
the compiler flags. Move $(CLANG_FLAGS) to the beginning of KBUILD_FLAGS
so that any new flags that might be added in the future can be
accurately tested.
