serdev: Do not instantiate serdevs on boards with known bogus DSDT entries

x86 ACPI devices which ship with only Android as their factory image use
older kernels which do not yet support ACPI serdev enumeration, as such
the serdev information in their ACPI tables is not reliable.

For example on the Asus ME176C tablet the serdev describing the Bluetooth
HCI points to the serdev_controller connected to the GPS and the other way
around.

Use the new acpi_quirk_skip_serdev_enumeration() helper to identify
known boards with this issue and then either abort adding the serdev
controller (creating a tty cdev instead) or only create the controller
leaving the instantation of the serdev itself up to platform code.

In the case where only the serdev controller is created the necessary
serdevs will instead be instantiated by the
drivers/platform/x86/x86-android-tablets.c kernel module.
