drm/privacy-screen: Add notifier support (v2)

Add support for privacy-screen consumers to register a notifier to
be notified of external (e.g. done by the hw itself on a hotkey press)
state changes.

Changes in v2:
- Drop WARN_ON(mutex_is_locked(&priv->lock)) check in
  drm_privacy_screen_call_notifier_chain() it may be locked by
  another thread, which would lead to a false-positive triggering
  of the check
