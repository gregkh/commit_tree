media: atomisp: remove polling_mode and subscr_index

This patch removes polling_mode and subscr_index from
`struct virtual_input_system_stream_s` as well as its usage [1]. Note
that for subscr_index, only the definition were removed because it was
not used anywhere.

[1] added on updating css version to irci_master_20150701_0213
