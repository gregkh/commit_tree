regulator: qcom-labibb: OCP interrupts are not a failure while disabled

Receiving the Over-Current Protection interrupt while the regulator is
disabled does not count as unhandled/failure (IRQ_NONE, or 0 as it were)
but a "fake event", usually due to inrush as the is regulator about to
be enabled.
