tty: reformat kernel-doc in tty_port.c

Kernel-doc is a bit strict about some formatting. So fix these:
1) When there is a tab in comments, it thinks the line is a continuation
   one. So the description of the functions end up as descriptions of
   the last parameter described. Remove the tabs.

2) Remove newlines before parameters description. This was not wrong per
   se, only inconsistent with the rest of the file.

3) Add periods to the end of sentences where appropriate.

4) Use recognized "Note" instead of "NB" (nota bene).

5) Add "()" to function names and "%" to constants, so that they are
   properly highlighted.

By the above, this patch also unifies these docs with the other
kernel-doc's in this file.
