bpf: Fix mount source show for bpffs

We noticed our tc ebpf tools can't start after we upgrade our in-house kernel
version from 4.19 to 5.10. That is because of the behaviour change in bpffs
caused by commit d2935de7e4fd ("vfs: Convert bpf to use the new mount API").

In our tc ebpf tools, we do strict environment check. If the environment is
not matched, we won't allow to start the ebpf progs. One of the check is whether
bpffs is properly mounted. The mount information of bpffs in kernel-4.19 and
kernel-5.10 are as follows:

- kernel 4.19
$ mount -t bpf bpffs /sys/fs/bpf
$ mount -t bpf
bpffs on /sys/fs/bpf type bpf (rw,relatime)

- kernel 5.10
$ mount -t bpf bpffs /sys/fs/bpf
$ mount -t bpf
none on /sys/fs/bpf type bpf (rw,relatime)

The device name in kernel-5.10 is displayed as none instead of bpffs, then our
environment check fails. Currently we modify the tools to adopt to the kernel
behaviour change, but I think we'd better change the kernel code to keep the
behavior consistent.

After this change, the mount information will be displayed the same with the
behavior in kernel-4.19, for example:

$ mount -t bpf bpffs /sys/fs/bpf
$ mount -t bpf
bpffs on /sys/fs/bpf type bpf (rw,relatime)
