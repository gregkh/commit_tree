tty: drop tty_schedule_flip()

Since commit a9c3f68f3cd8d (tty: Fix low_latency BUG) in 2014,
tty_flip_buffer_push() is only a wrapper to tty_schedule_flip(). All
users were converted in the previous patches, so remove
tty_schedule_flip() completely while inlining its body into
tty_flip_buffer_push().

One less exported function.
