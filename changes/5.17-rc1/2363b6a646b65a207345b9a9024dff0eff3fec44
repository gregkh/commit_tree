mt76: mt7921: drop offload_flags overwritten

offload_flags have to be dropped for mt7921 because mt76.omac_idx 0 would
always run as station mode that would cause Tx encapsulation setting
is not applied to mac80211.

Also, drop IEEE80211_OFFLOAD_ENCAP_4ADDR too because it is not really
being supported.
