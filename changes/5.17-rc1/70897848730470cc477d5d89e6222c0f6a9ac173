drm/amdgpu/display: Only set vblank_disable_immediate when PSR is not enabled

[Why]
PSR currently relies on the kernel's delayed vblank on/off mechanism
as an implicit bufferring mechanism to prevent excessive entry/exit.

Without this delay the user experience is impacted since it can take
a few frames to enter/exit.

[How]
Only allow vblank disable immediate for DC when psr is not supported.

Leave a TODO indicating that this support should be extended in the
future to delay independent of the vblank interrupt.
