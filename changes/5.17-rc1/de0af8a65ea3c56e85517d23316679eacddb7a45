drm/amdgpu: Only overwrite serial if field is empty

On Aldebaran, the serial may be obtained from the FRU. Only overwrite
the serial with the unique_id if the serial is empty. This will support
printing serial numbers for mGPU devices where there are 2 unique_ids
for the 2 GPUs, but only one serial number for the board
