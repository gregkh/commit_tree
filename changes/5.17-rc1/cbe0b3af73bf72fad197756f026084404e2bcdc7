media: ov8865: Disable only enabled regulators on error path

If powering on the sensor failed, the entire power-off sequence was run
independently of how far the power-on sequence proceeded before the error.
This lead to disabling regulators and/or clock that was not enabled.

Fix this by disabling only clocks and regulators that were enabled
previously.
