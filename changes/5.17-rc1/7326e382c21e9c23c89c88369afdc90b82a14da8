fanotify: report old and/or new parent+name in FAN_RENAME event

In the special case of FAN_RENAME event, we report old or new or both
old and new parent+name.

A single info record will be reported if either the old or new dir
is watched and two records will be reported if both old and new dir
(or their filesystem) are watched.

The old and new parent+name are reported using new info record types
FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_{OLD,NEW}_DFID_NAME, so if a single info record
is reported, it is clear to the application, to which dir entry the
fid+name info is referring to.
