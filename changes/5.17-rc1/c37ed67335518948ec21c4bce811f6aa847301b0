media: atomisp: pipe_binarydesc: drop logic incompatible with firmware

As we're using this firmware for ISP2401:
	https://github.com/intel-aero/meta-intel-aero-base/blob/master/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto/shisp_2401a0_v21.bin

Revert some changes that are not compatible with it, making
the code close to the Intel Aero one.
