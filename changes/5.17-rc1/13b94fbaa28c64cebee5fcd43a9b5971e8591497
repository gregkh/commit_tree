net: wwan: iosm: allow trace port be uninitialized

Collecting modem firmware traces is optional for the regular modem use.
There are not many reasons for aborting device initialization due to an
inability to initialize the trace port and (or) its debugfs interface.
So, demote the initialization failure erro message into a warning and do
not break the initialization sequence in this case. Rework packet
processing and deinitialization so that they do not crash in case of
uninitialized trace port.

This change is mainly a preparation for an upcoming configuration option
introduction that will help disable driver debugfs functionality.
