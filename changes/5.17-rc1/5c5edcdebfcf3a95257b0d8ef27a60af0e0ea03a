libbpf: Remove deprecation attribute from struct bpf_prog_prep_result

This deprecation annotation has no effect because for struct deprecation
attribute has to be declared after struct definition. But instead of
moving it to the end of struct definition, remove it. When deprecation
will go in effect at libbpf v0.7, this deprecation attribute will cause
libbpf's own source code compilation to trigger deprecation warnings,
which is unavoidable because libbpf still has to support that API.

So keep deprecation of APIs, but don't mark structs used in API as
deprecated.
