nfsd: Retry once in nfsd_open on an -EOPENSTALE return

If we get back -EOPENSTALE from an NFSv4 open, then we either got some
unhandled error or the inode we got back was not the same as the one
associated with the dentry.

We really have no recourse in that situation other than to retry the
open, and if it fails to just return nfserr_stale back to the client.
