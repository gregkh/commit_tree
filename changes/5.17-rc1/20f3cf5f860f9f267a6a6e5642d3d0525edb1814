HID: wacom: Avoid using stale array indicies to read contact count

If we ever see a touch report with contact count data we initialize
several variables used to read the contact count in the pre-report
phase. These variables are never reset if we process a report which
doesn't contain a contact count, however. This can cause the pre-
report function to trigger a read of arbitrary memory (e.g. NULL
if we're lucky) and potentially crash the driver.

This commit restores resetting of the variables back to default
"none" values that were used prior to the commit mentioned
below.
