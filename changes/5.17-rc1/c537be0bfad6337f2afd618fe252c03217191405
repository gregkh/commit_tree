i2c: acpi: Add i2c_acpi_new_device_by_fwnode() function

Change i2c_acpi_new_device() into i2c_acpi_new_device_by_fwnode() and
add a static inline wrapper providing the old i2c_acpi_new_device()
behavior.

This is necessary because in some cases we may only have access
to the fwnode / acpi_device and not to the matching physical-node
struct device *.
