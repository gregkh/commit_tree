drm/i915: Remove dma_resv_prune

The signaled bit is already used for quick testing if a fence is signaled.
On top of that, it's a terrible abuse of dma-fence api, and in the common
case where the object is already locked by the caller, the trylock will fail.

If it were useful, the core dma-api would have exposed the same functionality.

The fact that i915 has a dma_resv_utils.c file should be a warning that the
functionality either belongs in core, or is not very useful at all.
In this case the latter.
