drm/tegra: vic: Fix DMA API misuse

Upon failure, dma_alloc_coherent() returns NULL. If that does happen,
passing some uninitialised stack contents to dma_mapping_error() - which
belongs to a different API in the first place - has precious little
chance of detecting it.

Also include the correct header, because the fragile transitive
inclusion currently providing it is going to break soon.
