ARM: samsung: Remove HAVE_S3C2410_I2C and use direct dependencies

A separate Kconfig option HAVE_S3C2410_I2C for Samsung SoCs is not
really needed and the i2c-s3c24xx driver can depend on Samsung ARM
architectures instead. This also enables i2c-s3c2410 for arm64 Exynos
SoCs, which is required for example by Exynos850.

This is basically continuation of work made in following commits:
  - commit d96890fca9fd ("rtc: s3c: remove HAVE_S3C_RTC in favor of
    direct dependencies")
  - commit 7dd3cae90d85 ("ARM: samsung: remove HAVE_S3C2410_WATCHDOG and
    use direct dependencies")
