EDAC/amd64: Allow for DF Indirect Broadcast reads

The DF Indirect Access method allows for "Broadcast" accesses in which
case no specific instance is targeted. Add support using a reserved
instance ID of 0xFF to indicate a broadcast access. Set the FICAA
register appropriately.

Define helpers functions for instance and broadcast reads and use them
where appropriate.

Drop the "amd_" prefix since these functions are all static.
