misc: at25: Make driver OF independent again

The commit f60e7074902a ("misc: at25: Make use of device property API")
made a good job by enabling the driver for non-OF platforms, but the
recent commit 604288bc6196 ("nvmem: eeprom: at25: fix type compiler warnings")
brought that back.

Restore greatness of the driver once again.

Fixes: eab61fb1cc2e ("nvmem: eeprom: at25: fram discovery simplification")
Fixes: fd307a4ad332 ("nvmem: prepare basics for FRAM support")
