ASoC: tegra-audio-rt5677: Correct example

Remove non-existent properties from the example of the binding. These
properties were borrower from the old txt binding, but they were never
used in practice and aren't documented in the new binding. They aren't
reported by the binding checker because dtschema needs extra patch that
hasn't been upstreamed yet to make unevaluatedProperties work properly.
