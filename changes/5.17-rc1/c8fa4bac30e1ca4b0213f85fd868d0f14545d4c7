net: ag71xx: use phylink_generic_validate()

ag71xx apparently only supports MII port type, which makes it different
from other implementations. However, Oleksij says there is no special
reason for this.

Convert the driver to use phylink_generic_validate(), which will allow
all ethtool port linkmodes instead of only MII, giving the driver
consistent behaviour with other drivers.
