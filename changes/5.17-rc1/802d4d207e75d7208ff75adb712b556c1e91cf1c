bnx2x: Invalidate fastpath HSI version for VFs

Commit 0a6890b9b4df ("bnx2x: Utilize FW 7.13.15.0.")
added validation for fastpath HSI versions for different
client init which was not meant for SR-IOV VF clients, which
resulted in firmware asserts when running VF clients with
different fastpath HSI version.

This patch along with the new firmware support in patch #1
fixes this behavior in order to not validate fastpath HSI
version for the VFs.
