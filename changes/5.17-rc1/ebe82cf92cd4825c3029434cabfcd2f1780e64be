i2c: mpc: Correct I2C reset procedure

Current I2C reset procedure is broken in two ways:
1) It only generate 1 START instead of 9 STARTs and STOP.
2) It leaves the bus Busy so every I2C xfer after the first
   fixup calls the reset routine again, for every xfer there after.

This fixes both errors.
