rcu-tasks: Add a ->percpu_enqueue_lim to the rcu_tasks structure

This commit adds a ->percpu_enqueue_lim field to the rcu_tasks structure.
This field contains two to the power of the ->percpu_enqueue_shift
field, easing construction of iterators over the per-CPU queues that
might contain RCU Tasks callbacks.  Such iterators will be introduced
in later commits.
