mm: memcontrol: make cgroup_memory_nokmem static

Commit 494c1dfe855e ("mm: memcg/slab: create a new set of kmalloc-cg-<n>
caches") makes cgroup_memory_nokmem global, however, it is unnecessary
because there is already a function mem_cgroup_kmem_disabled() which
exports it.

Just make it static and replace it with mem_cgroup_kmem_disabled() in
mm/slab_common.c.
