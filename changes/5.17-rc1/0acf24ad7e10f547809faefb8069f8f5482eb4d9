ACPICA: Add support for PCC Opregion special context data

ACPICA commit 55526e8a6133cbf5a9cc0fb75a95dbbac6eb98e6

PCC Opregion added in ACPIC 6.3 requires special context data similar
to GPIO and Generic Serial Bus as it needs to know the internal PCC
buffer and its length as well as the PCC channel index when the opregion
handler is being executed by the OSPM.

Lets add support for the special context data needed by PCC Opregion.
