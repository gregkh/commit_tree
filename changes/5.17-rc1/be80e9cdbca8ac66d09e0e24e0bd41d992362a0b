libbpf: Rename DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS into LIBBPF_OPTS

It's confusing that libbpf-provided helper macro doesn't start with
LIBBPF. Also "declare" vs "define" is confusing terminology, I can never
remember and always have to look up previous examples.

Bypass both issues by renaming DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS into a short and
clean LIBBPF_OPTS. To avoid breaking existing code, provide:

  #define DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS LIBBPF_OPTS

in libbpf_legacy.h. We can decide later if we ever want to remove it or
we'll keep it forever because it doesn't add any maintainability burden.
