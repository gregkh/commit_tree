parisc: Fix pdc_toc_pim_11 and pdc_toc_pim_20 definitions

The definitions for pdc_toc_pim_11 and pdc_toc_pim_20 are wrong since they
include an entry for a hversion field which doesn't exist in the specification.

Fix this and clean up some whitespaces so that the whole file will be in
sync with it's copy in the SeaBIOS-hppa sources.
