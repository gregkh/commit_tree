hv_netvsc: Use bitmap_zalloc() when applicable

'send_section_map' is a bitmap. So use 'bitmap_zalloc()' to simplify code,
improve the semantic and avoid some open-coded arithmetic in allocator
arguments.

Also change the corresponding 'kfree()' into 'bitmap_free()' to keep
consistency.

While at it, change an '== NULL' test into a '!'.
