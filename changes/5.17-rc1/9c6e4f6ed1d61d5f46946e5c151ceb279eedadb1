drm/vc4: hdmi: Make sure the controller is powered up during bind

In the bind hook, we actually need the device to have the HSM clock
running during the final part of the display initialisation where we
reset the controller and initialise the CEC component.

Failing to do so will result in a complete, silent, hang of the CPU.
