ath11k: add string type to search board data in board-2.bin for WCN6855

Currently ath11k only support string type with bus, chip id and board id
such as "bus=ahb,qmi-chip-id=1,qmi-board-id=4" for ahb bus chip and
"bus=pci,qmi-chip-id=0,qmi-board-id=255" for PCIe bus chip in
board-2.bin. For WCN6855, it is not enough to distinguish all different
chips.

This is to add a new string type which include bus, chip id, board id,
vendor, device, subsystem-vendor and subsystem-device for WCN6855.

ath11k will first load board-2.bin and search in it for the board data
with the above parameters, if matched one board data, then download it
to firmware, if not matched any one, then ath11k will download the file
board.bin to firmware.
