qlcnic: Simplify DMA setting

As stated in [1], dma_set_mask() with a 64-bit mask will never fail if
dev->dma_mask is non-NULL.
So, if it fails, the 32 bits case will also fail for the same reason.

So qlcnic_set_dma_mask(), (in qlcnic_main.c) can be simplified a lot and
inlined directly in its only caller.

If dma_set_mask_and_coherent() succeeds, 'pci_using_dac' is known to be 1.
So it can be removed from all the calling chain.

qlcnic_setup_netdev() can finally be simplified as-well.
