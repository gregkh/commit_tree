watchdog: s3c2410: Cleanup PMU related code

Now that PMU enablement code was extended for new Exynos SoCs, it
doesn't look very cohesive and consistent anymore. Do a bit of renaming,
grouping and style changes, to make it look good again. While at it, add
quirks documentation as well.

No functional change, just a refactoring commit.
