drm/i915: Restore memory mapping for DPT FBs across system suspend/resume

At least during hibernation the DPT mappings are lost with all stolen
memory content, so suspend/resume these mappings similarly to GGTT
mappings.

This fixes a problem where the restoring modeset during system resume fails
with pipe faults if a tiled framebuffer was active before suspend.

v2: Clarify the way restore works in intel_dpt_resume()'s Docbook entry.
