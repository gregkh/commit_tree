power: supply: ab8500: Standardize temp res lookup

The lookup from battery temperature to internal resistance was
using its own format. Rewrite this to use the table inside
struct power_supply_battery_info:s resist_table.

The supplied resistance table has to be rewritten to express
the resistance in percent of the factory resistance as a
side effect.

We can then rely on the library function
power_supply_temp2resist_simple() to interpolate the internal
resistance percent from the temperature.
