drm/etnaviv: use a 32 bit mask as coherent DMA mask

The STLB and the first command buffer (which is used to set up the TLBs)
has a 32 bit size restriction in hardware. There seems to be no way to
specify addresses larger than 32 bit. Keep it simple and restict the
addresses to the lower 4 GiB range for all coherent DMA memory
allocations.

Please note, that platform_device_alloc() will initialize dev->dma_mask
to point to pdev->platform_dma_mask, thus dma_set_mask() will work as
expected.

While at it, move the dma_mask setup code to the of_dma_configure() to
keep all the DMA setup code next to each other.
