platform/x86: x86-android-tablets: New driver for x86 Android tablets

x86 tablets which ship with Android as (part of) the factory image
typically have various problems with their DSDTs. The factory kernels
shipped on these devices typically have device addresses and GPIOs
hardcoded in the kernel, rather then specified in their DSDT.

With the DSDT containing a random collection of devices which may or
may not actually be present as well as missing devices which are
actually present.

This driver, which loads only on affected models based on DMI matching,
adds DMI based instantiating of kernel devices for devices which are
missing from the DSDT, fixing e.g. battery monitoring, touchpads and/or
accelerometers not working.

Note the Kconfig help text also refers to "various fixes" ATM there are
no such fixes, but there are also known cases where entries are present
in the DSDT but they contain bugs, such as missing/wrong GPIOs. The plan
is to also add fixes for things like this here in the future.

This is the least ugly option to get these devices to fully work and to
do so without adding any extra code to the main kernel image (vmlinuz)
when built as a module.
