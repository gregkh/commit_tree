crypto: hisilicon/qm - modify the handling method after abnormal interruption

After processing an interrupt event and the interrupt function is
enabled by writing the QM_DOORBELL_CMD_AEQ register, the hardware
may generate new interrupt events due to processing other user's task
when the subsequent interrupt events have not been processed. The new
interrupt event will disrupt the current normal processing flow and
cause other problems.

Therefore, the operation of writing the QM_DOORBELL_CMD_AEQ doorbell
register needs to be placed after all interrupt events processing
are completed.
