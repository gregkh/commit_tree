ASoC: intel: sof_sdw: Use a fixed DAI link id for AMP

Currently, we assign SoundWire DAI link id according to the order in
the link address table, with the assumption that the headset codec is
listed first, then amplifiers and last capture devices. If the headset
codec is not present in a platform, the dai link for amplifiers will be
shifted, which can be handled in two ways
a) modify the topology to renumber the dailink changes
b) keep the dailink numbers constant in topology but also avoid the
   variations in the machine driver.

This patch adds support for option b), the dailink index for amplifiers
and capture devices becomes fixed.
