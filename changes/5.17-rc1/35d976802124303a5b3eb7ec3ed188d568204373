net: dsa: tag_ocelot: convert to tagger-owned data

The felix driver makes very light use of dp->priv, and the tagger is
effectively stateless. dp->priv is practically only needed to set up a
callback to perform deferred xmit of PTP and STP packets using the
ocelot-8021q tagging protocol (the main ocelot tagging protocol makes no
use of dp->priv, although this driver sets up dp->priv irrespective of
actual tagging protocol in use).

struct felix_port (what used to be pointed to by dp->priv) is removed
and replaced with a two-sided structure. The public side of this
structure, visible to the switch driver, is ocelot_8021q_tagger_data.
The private side is ocelot_8021q_tagger_private, and the latter
structure physically encapsulates the former. The public half of the
tagger data structure can be accessed through a helper of the same name
(ocelot_8021q_tagger_data) which also sanity-checks the protocol
currently in use by the switch. The public/private split was requested
by Andrew Lunn.
