mm/memremap: add ZONE_DEVICE support for compound pages

Add a new @vmemmap_shift property for struct dev_pagemap which specifies
that a devmap is composed of a set of compound pages of order
@vmemmap_shift, instead of base pages.  When a compound page devmap is
requested, all but the first page are initialised as tail pages instead
of order-0 pages.

For certain ZONE_DEVICE users like device-dax which have a fixed page
size, this creates an opportunity to optimize GUP and GUP-fast walkers,
treating it the same way as THP or hugetlb pages.

Additionally, commit 7118fc2906e2 ("hugetlb: address ref count racing in
prep_compound_gigantic_page") removed set_page_count() because the
setting of page ref count to zero was redundant.  devmap pages don't
come from page allocator though and only head page refcount is used for
compound pages, hence initialize tail page count to zero.
