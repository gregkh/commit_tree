selftests/arm64: remove ARRAY_SIZE define from vec-syscfg.c

ARRAY_SIZE is defined in several selftests. Remove definitions from
individual test files and include header file for the define instead.
ARRAY_SIZE define is added in a separate patch to prepare for this
change.

Remove ARRAY_SIZE from vec-syscfg.c and pickup the one defined in
kselftest.h.
