gpu: host1x: Add host1x_channel_stop()

Add host1x_channel_stop() which waits till channel becomes idle and then
stops the channel hardware. This is needed for supporting suspend/resume
by host1x drivers since the hardware state is lost after power-gating,
thus the channel needs to be stopped before client enters into suspend.
