cachefiles: Make some tracepoint adjustments

Make some adjustments to tracepoints to make the tracing a bit more
followable:

 (1) Standardise on displaying the backing inode number as "B=<hex>" with
     no leading zeros.

 (2) Make the cachefiles_lookup tracepoint log the directory inode number
     as well as the looked-up inode number.

 (3) Add a cachefiles_lookup tracepoint into cachefiles_get_directory() to
     log directory lookup.

 (4) Add a new cachefiles_mkdir tracepoint and use that to log a successful
     mkdir from cachefiles_get_directory().

 (5) Make the cachefiles_unlink and cachefiles_rename tracepoints log the
     inode number of the affected file/dir rather than dentry struct
     pointers.
