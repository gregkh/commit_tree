KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Avoid cpu_in_guest atomics on entry and exit

cpu_in_guest is set to determine if a CPU needs to be IPI'ed to exit
the guest and notice the need_tlb_flush bit.

This can be implemented as a global per-CPU pointer to the currently
running guest instead of per-guest cpumasks, saving 2 atomics per
entry/exit. P7/8 doesn't require cpu_in_guest, nor does a nested HV
(only the L0 does), so move it to the P9 HV path.
