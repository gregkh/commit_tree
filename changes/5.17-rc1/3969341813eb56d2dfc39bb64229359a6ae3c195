ASoC: imx-card: improve the sound quality for low rate

According to RM, on auto mode:
For codec AK4458 and AK4497, the lowest ratio of MLCK/FS is 256
if sample rate is 8kHz-48kHz,
For codec AK5558, the lowest ratio of MLCK/FS is 512 if sample
rate is 8kHz-48kHz.

With these setting the sound quality for 8kHz-48kHz can be improved.
