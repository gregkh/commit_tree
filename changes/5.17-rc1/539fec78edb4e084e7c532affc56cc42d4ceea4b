vdpa: add driver_override support

`driver_override` allows to control which of the vDPA bus drivers
binds to a vDPA device.

If `driver_override` is not set, the previous behaviour is followed:
devices use the first vDPA bus driver loaded (unless auto binding
is disabled).

Tested on Fedora 34 with driverctl(8):
  $ modprobe virtio-vdpa
  $ modprobe vhost-vdpa
  $ modprobe vdpa-sim-net

  $ vdpa dev add mgmtdev vdpasim_net name dev1

  # dev1 is attached to the first vDPA bus driver loaded
  $ driverctl -b vdpa list-devices
    dev1 virtio_vdpa

  $ driverctl -b vdpa set-override dev1 vhost_vdpa

  $ driverctl -b vdpa list-devices
    dev1 vhost_vdpa [*]

  Note: driverctl(8) integrates with udev so the binding is
  preserved.
