media: i2c: max9286: Depend on VIDEO_V4L2

The MAX9286 has not explicitly declared a dependency upon VIDEO_V4L2.
While this dependency has likely always been met by configurations
including it, the device does use V4L2 core, and should depend upon it.

Add VIDEO_V4L2 as a dependency to match other drivers and prevent
failures when compile testing.
