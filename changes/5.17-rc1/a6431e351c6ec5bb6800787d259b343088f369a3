aoe: remove redundant assignment on variable n

The variable n is being bit-wise or'd with a value and reassigned
before being returned. The update of n is redundant, replace
the |= operator with | instead. Cleans up clang scan warning:

drivers/block/aoe/aoecmd.c:125:9: warning: Although the value stored
to 'n' is used in the enclosing expression, the value is never
actually read from 'n' [deadcode.DeadStores]
