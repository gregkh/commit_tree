media: hantro: postproc: Fix motion vector space size

When the post-processor hardware block is enabled, the driver
allocates an internal queue of buffers for the decoder enginer,
and uses the vb2 queue for the post-processor engine.

For instance, on a G1 core, the decoder engine produces NV12 buffers
and the post-processor engine can produce YUY2 buffers. The decoder
engine expects motion vectors to be appended to the NV12 buffers,
but this is only required for CODECs that need motion vectors,
such as H.264.

Fix the post-processor logic accordingly.
