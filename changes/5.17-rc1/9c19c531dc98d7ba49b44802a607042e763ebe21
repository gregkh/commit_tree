phy: phy-rockchip-inno-usb2: support #address_cells = 2

New Rockchip devices have the usb phy nodes as standalone devices.
These nodes have register nodes with #address_cells = 2, but only use 32
bit addresses.

Adjust the driver to check if the returned address is "0", and adjust
the index in that case.
