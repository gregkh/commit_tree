zsmalloc: introduce some helper functions

Patch series "zsmalloc: remove bit_spin_lock", v2.

zsmalloc uses bit_spin_lock to minimize space overhead since it's zpage
granularity lock.  However, it causes zsmalloc non-working under
PREEMPT_RT as well as adding too much complication.

This patchset tries to replace the bit_spin_lock with per-pool rwlock.
It also removes unnecessary zspage isolation logic from class, which was
the other part too much complication added into zsmalloc.

Last patch changes the get_cpu_var to local_lock to make it work in
PREEMPT_RT.

This patch (of 9):

get_zspage_mapping returns fullness as well as class_idx.  However, the
fullness is usually not used since it could be stale in some contexts.
It causes misleading as well as unnecessary instructions so this patch
introduces zspage_class.

obj_to_location also produces page and index but we don't need always
the index, either so this patch introduces obj_to_page.
