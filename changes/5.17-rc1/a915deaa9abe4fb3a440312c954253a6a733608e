libcxgb: Don't accidentally set RTO_ONLINK in cxgb_find_route()

Mask the ECN bits before calling ip_route_output_ports(). The tos
variable might be passed directly from an IPv4 header, so it may have
the last ECN bit set. This interferes with the route lookup process as
ip_route_output_key_hash() interpretes this bit specially (to restrict
the route scope).

Found by code inspection, compile tested only.
