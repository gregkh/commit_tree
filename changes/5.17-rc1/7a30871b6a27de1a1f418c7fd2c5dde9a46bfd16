rcu-tasks: Introduce ->percpu_enqueue_shift for dynamic queue selection

This commit introduces a ->percpu_enqueue_shift field to the rcu_tasks
structure, and uses it to shift down the CPU number in order to
select a rcu_tasks_percpu structure.  This field is currently set to a
sufficiently large shift count to always select the CPU-0 instance of
the rcu_tasks_percpu structure, and later commits will adjust this.
