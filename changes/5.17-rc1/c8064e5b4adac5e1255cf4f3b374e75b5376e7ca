bpf: Let bpf_warn_invalid_xdp_action() report more info

In non trivial scenarios, the action id alone is not sufficient to
identify the program causing the warning. Before the previous patch,
the generated stack-trace pointed out at least the involved device
driver.

Let's additionally include the program name and id, and the relevant
device name.

If the user needs additional infos, he can fetch them via a kernel
probe, leveraging the arguments added here.
