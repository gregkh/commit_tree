drm/meson: remove useless recursive components matching

The initial design was recursive to cover all port/endpoints, but only the first layer
of endpoints should be covered by the components list.
This also breaks the MIPI-DSI init/bridge attach sequence, thus only parse the
first endpoints instead of recursing.
