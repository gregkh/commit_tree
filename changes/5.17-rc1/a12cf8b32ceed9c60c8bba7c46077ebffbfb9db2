fs/ioctl: remove unnecessary __user annotation

__user annotations are used by the checker (e.g sparse) to mark user
pointers.  However here __user is applied to a struct directly, without a
pointer being directly involved.

Although the presence of __user does not cause sparse to emit a warning,
__user should be removed for consistency with other uses of offsetof().

Note: No functional changes intended.
