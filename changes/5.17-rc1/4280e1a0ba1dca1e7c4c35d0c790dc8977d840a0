drm/kirin: dsi: Adjust probe order

Without proper care and an agreement between how DSI hosts and devices
drivers register their MIPI-DSI entities and potential components, we can
end up in a situation where the drivers can never probe.

Most drivers were taking evasive maneuvers to try to workaround this,
but not all of them were following the same conventions, resulting in
various incompatibilities between DSI hosts and devices.

Now that we have a sequence agreed upon and documented, let's convert
kirin to it.
