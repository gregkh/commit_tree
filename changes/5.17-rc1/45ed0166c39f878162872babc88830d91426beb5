ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Support retrieving the codec IRQ from the AMCR0F28 ACPI dev

Some X86 tablets, which ship with Android as factory installed OS,
specify codec IRQs/GPIOS in a special Android AMCR0F28 ACPI device.

Add support for retrieving the codec IRQ from this ACPI device instead
of from the 10EC5640 device describing the codec itself and enable this
on Asus MemoPad 7 ME176C tablets.

This fixes jack-detect not working on these tablets.
