null_blk: don't suppress partitioning information

This manually reverts commit 27290b469051 ("null_blk: suppress invalid
partition info").  The message in that commit log can't appearch as
the flag is never checked during probing, and there is no good reason
to treat null_blk special in /proc/partitions.
