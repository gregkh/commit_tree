KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Use Linux SPR save/restore to manage some host SPRs

Linux implements SPR save/restore including storage space for registers
in the task struct for process context switching. Make use of this
similarly to the way we make use of the context switching fp/vec save
restore.

This improves code reuse, allows some stack space to be saved, and helps
with avoiding VRSAVE updates if they are not required.
