iwlwifi: support 4-bits in MAC step value

We have a MAC component (which is inside the SoC) and it has several
different HW steps.  3 bits used to be enough but now we need 4-bits
to represent all the different steps.

Properly support 4-bits in the MAC step value by refactoring all the
current handling of the MAC step/dash.

Already from family 8000 and up the dash (bits 0-1) no longer exists
and the step (until 8000 bits 2-3) consists of the dash bits as well.

To do this remove the CSR_HW_REV_STEP and the CSR_HW_REV_DASH
macros, replace them with CSR_HW_REV_STEP_DASH and add hw_rev_step
into the trans struct.

In addition remove the CSR_HW_IF_CONFIG_REG_MSK_MAC_STEP and
CSR_HW_IF_CONFIG_REG_MSK_MAC_DASH macros and create a new macro
combining the 2 (this way we don't need shifting or anything else.)
