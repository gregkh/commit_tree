dma-direct: fail allocations that can't be made coherent

If the architecture can't remap or set an address uncached there is no way
to fullfill a request for a coherent allocation.  Return NULL in that case.
Note that this case currently does not happen, so this is a theoretical
fixup and/or a preparation for eventually supporting platforms that
can't support coherent allocations with the generic code.
