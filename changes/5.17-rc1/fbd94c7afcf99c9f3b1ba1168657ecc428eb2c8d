bpf: Pass a set of bpf_core_relo-s to prog_load command.

struct bpf_core_relo is generated by llvm and processed by libbpf.
It's a de-facto uapi.
With CO-RE in the kernel the struct bpf_core_relo becomes uapi de-jure.
Add an ability to pass a set of 'struct bpf_core_relo' to prog_load command
and let the kernel perform CO-RE relocations.

Note the struct bpf_line_info and struct bpf_func_info have the same
layout when passed from LLVM to libbpf and from libbpf to the kernel
except "insn_off" fields means "byte offset" when LLVM generates it.
Then libbpf converts it to "insn index" to pass to the kernel.
The struct bpf_core_relo's "insn_off" field is always "byte offset".
