selftests/bpf: Build testing_helpers.o out of tree

Add $(OUTPUT) prefix to testing_helpers.o, so it can be built out of
tree when necessary. At the moment, in addition to being built in-tree
even when out-of-tree is required, testing_helpers.o is not built with
the right recipe when cross-building.

For consistency the other helpers, cgroup_helpers and trace_helpers, can
also be passed as objects instead of source. Use *_HELPERS variable to
keep the Makefile readable.
