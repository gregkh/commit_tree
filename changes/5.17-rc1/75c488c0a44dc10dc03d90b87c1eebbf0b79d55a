staging: r8188eu: require a single bulk in endpoint

The current r8188eu driver code has no support for interrupt in
endpoints. Some parts of the code assume implicitly that we use
one single bulk in endpoint for the incoming network data.

Make this assumption clearer and reject devices that have more than
one bulk in endpoint. Ignore any interrupt in endpoints.

We can then change RtInPipe into a single value instead of an array.
There's no need any more to pass around the number of in endpoints.
We know that it's one or the device would have been rejected.
