mt76: mt7921: fix a possible race enabling/disabling runtime-pm

Fix a possible race enabling/disabling runtime-pm between
mt7921_pm_set() and mt7921_poll_rx() since mt7921_pm_wake_work()
always schedules rx-napi callback and it will trigger
mt7921_pm_power_save_work routine putting chip to in low-power state
during mt7921_pm_set processing.
