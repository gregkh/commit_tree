HID: logitech: add myself as a reviewer

Currently, I have to use a separate email address and maintain several
filters to monitor changes to Logitech drivers, so that I can have an
opportunity to review them. Since I am very interested in keeping up
with the changes, as I have a lot of the hardware and maintain the main
userspace stacks that depend on these drivers, I would like to mark
myself as a reviewer. I would also be open to be marked as a maintainer
if Benjamin thinks it makes sense.
