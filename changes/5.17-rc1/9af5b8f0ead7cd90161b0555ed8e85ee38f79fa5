fs: dlm: add debugfs rawmsg send functionality

This patch adds a dlm functionality to send a raw dlm message to a
specific cluster node. This raw message can be build by user space and
send out by writing the message to "rawmsg" dlm debugfs file.

There is a in progress scapy dlm module which provides a easy build of
DLM messages in user space. For example:

DLM(h_cmd=3, o_nextcmd=1, h_nodeid=1, h_lockspace=0xe4f48a18, ...)

The goal is to provide an easy reproducable state to crash DLM or to
fuzz the DLM kernel stack if there are possible ways to crash it.

Note: that if the sequence number is zero and dlm version is not set to
3.1 the kernel will automatic will set a right sequence number, otherwise
DLM stack testing is not possible.
