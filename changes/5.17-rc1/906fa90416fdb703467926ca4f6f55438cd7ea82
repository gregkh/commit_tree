KVM: x86: Add an emulation type to handle completion of user exits

The next patch would use kvm_emulate_instruction() with
EMULTYPE_SKIP in complete_userspace_io callback to fix a
problem in msr access emulation. However, EMULTYPE_SKIP
only updates RIP, more things like updating interruptibility
state and injecting single-step #DBs would be done in the
callback. Since the emulator also does those things after
x86_emulate_insn(), add a new emulation type to pair with
EMULTYPE_SKIP to do those things for completion of user exits
within the emulator.
