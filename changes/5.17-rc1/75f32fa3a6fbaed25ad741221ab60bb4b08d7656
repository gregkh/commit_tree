ACPI: DPTF: Update device ID in a comment

There is a comment in dptf_pch_fivr.c which seemingly was added under
the assumption that the PCH FIVR driver would be used on Tiger Lake
platforms, but support for Alder Lake has been udded to it by commit
38748bcb940e ("ACPI: DPTF: Support Alder Lake"), so update the
comment to cover a broader range of platforms by changing the device
ID mentioned by it to INTC10xx.
