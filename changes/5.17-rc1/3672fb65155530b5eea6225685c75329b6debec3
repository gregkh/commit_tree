tty: serial: uartlite: allow 64 bit address

The base address of uartlite registers could be 64 bit address which is from
device resource. When ulite_probe() calls ulite_assign(), this 64 bit
address is casted to 32-bit. The fix is to replace "u32" type with
"phys_addr_t" type for the base address in ulite_assign() argument list.
