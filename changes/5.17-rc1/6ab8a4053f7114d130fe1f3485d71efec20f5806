KVM: VMX: Avoid to rdmsrl(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_ESP)

The value of host MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_ESP is known to be constant for
each CPU: (cpu_entry_stack(cpu) + 1) when 32 bit syscall is enabled or
NULL is 32 bit syscall is not enabled.

So rdmsrl() can be avoided for the first case and both rdmsrl() and
vmcs_writel() can be avoided for the second case.
