ACPI: EC: Avoid queuing unnecessary work in acpi_ec_submit_event()

Notice that it is not necessary to queue up the event work again
if the while () loop in acpi_ec_event_handler() is still running
which is the case if nr_pending_queries is greater than 0 at the
beginning of acpi_ec_submit_event() and modify the code to avoid
doing that.

While at it, rename nr_pending_queries in struct acpi_ec to
events_to_process which actually matches the role of that field
and change its data type to unsigned int which is sufficient.

No expected functional impact.
