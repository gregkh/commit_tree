PCI: xgene: Fix IB window setup

Commit 6dce5aa59e0b ("PCI: xgene: Use inbound resources for setup")
broke PCI support on XGene. The cause is the IB resources are now sorted
in address order instead of being in DT dma-ranges order. The result is
which inbound registers are used for each region are swapped. I don't
know the details about this h/w, but it appears that IB region 0
registers can't handle a size greater than 4GB. In any case, limiting
the size for region 0 is enough to get back to the original assignment
of dma-ranges to regions.
