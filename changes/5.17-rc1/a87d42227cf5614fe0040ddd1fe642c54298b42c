ASoC: cs35l41: Convert tables to shared source code

To support CS35L41 in HDA systems the HDA driver
for CS35L41 would have to duplicate some functions
that already exist on ASoC driver
So instead of duplicate the code, use the new lib
source as a shared resource for both ASoC and HDA

Also, change the way CONFIG_SND_SOC_CS35L41 is
selected, as reported by Intel Kernel test robot,
it is possible to build SND_SOC_CS35L41_SPI/I2C
without the main driver, which would lead to build
failures.
