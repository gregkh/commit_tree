clk: Enable/Disable runtime PM for clk_summary

The registers for some clocks in the SOC area, which are under the power
domain are required to be enabled before accessing them. During the
clk_summary if the power-domains are not enabled they could result into
NoC errors.

Thus ensure the register access of the clock controller is done with
pm_untime_get/put functions.
