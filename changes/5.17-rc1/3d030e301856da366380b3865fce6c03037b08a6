powerpc/watchdog: Fix wd_smp_last_reset_tb reporting

wd_smp_last_reset_tb now gets reset by watchdog_smp_panic() as part of
marking CPUs stuck and removing them from the pending mask before it
begins any printing. This causes last reset times reported to be off.

Fix this by reading it into a local variable before it gets reset.
