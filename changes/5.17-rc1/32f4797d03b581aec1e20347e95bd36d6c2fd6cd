media: dvb-frontends/stv0367: remove redundant variable ADCClk_Hz

GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=Colin King
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=colin.king@canonical.com

Variable ADCClk_Hz is being initialised with a variable that is never read
and then re-assigned immediately afterwards. Clean up the code by removing
it and just returning the return value from the call to stv0367cab_get_mclk

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
