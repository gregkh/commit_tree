ASoC: tegra20: spdif: Filter out unsupported rates

SPDIF and other SoC components share audio PLL on Tegra, thus only one
component may set the desired base clock rate. This creates problem for
HDMI audio because it uses SPDIF and audio may not work if SPDIF's clock
doesn't exactly match standard audio rate since some receivers may reject
audio in that case. Filter out audio rates which SPDIF output can't
support, assuming that other components won't change rate at runtime.
