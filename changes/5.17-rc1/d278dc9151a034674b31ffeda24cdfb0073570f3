ALSA: hda/tegra: Fix Tegra194 HDA reset failure

HDA regression is recently reported on Tegra194 based platforms.
This happens because "hda2codec_2x" reset does not really exist
in Tegra194 and it causes probe failure. All the HDA based audio
tests fail at the moment. This underlying issue is exposed by
commit c045ceb5a145 ("reset: tegra-bpmp: Handle errors in BPMP
response") which now checks return code of BPMP command response.
Fix this issue by skipping unavailable reset on Tegra194.
