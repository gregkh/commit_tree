exit: Remove profile_task_exit & profile_munmap

When I say remove I mean remove.  All profile_task_exit and
profile_munmap do is call a blocking notifier chain.  The helpers
profile_task_register and profile_task_unregister are not called
anywhere in the tree.  Which means this is all dead code.

So remove the dead code and make it easier to read do_exit.
