mmc: dw_mmc: Add driver callbacks for data read timeout

Current dw_mci driver supports a TMOUT register which consists of a 24
bit field (TMOUT[31:8]) for the DATA_TIMEOUT. The maximum value of this
field is 0xFFFFFF, which with a 200MHz clock will give a full DRTO of:

0xFFFFFF / 200000000 => ~84 ms

However, the ARTPEC-8 SoC DWMMC IP version has a TMOUT register with an
extended DATA_TIMEOUT field, which supports longer timers for the DRTO.
In this version the DATA_TIMEOUT field is split into two, which with the
same 200MHz clock as above will allow a maximum timeout of:

((TMOUT[10:8] -1) * 0xFFFFFF + TMOUT[31:11] * 8) / 200000000 => ~587 ms

Add driver callbacks for implementation specific data timeout, and
implement callback functions for the ARTPEC-8 SoC.
