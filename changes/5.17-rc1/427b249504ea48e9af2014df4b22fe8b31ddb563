arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280-crd: Add device tree files for CRD

CRD (Compute Reference Design) is a sc7280 based board, largely
derived from the existing IDP board design with some key deltas
1. has EC and H1 over SPI similar to IDP2
2. touchscreen and trackpad support
3. eDP display

We just add the barebones dts file here, subsequent patches will
add support for EC/H1 and other components.
