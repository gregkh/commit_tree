can: do not copy the payload of RTR frames

The actual payload length of the CAN Remote Transmission Request (RTR)
frames is always 0, i.e. no payload is transmitted on the wire.
However, those RTR frames still use the DLC to indicate the length of
the requested frame.

For this reason, it is incorrect to copy the payload of RTR frames
(the payload buffer would only contain garbage data). This patch
encapsulates the payload copy in a check toward the RTR flag.
