netfilter: nf_tables: add register tracking infrastructure

This patch adds new infrastructure to skip redundant selector store
operations on the same register to achieve a performance boost from
the packet path.

This is particularly noticeable in pure linear rulesets but it also
helps in rulesets which are already heaving relying in maps to avoid
ruleset linear inspection.

The idea is to keep data of the most recurrent store operations on
register to reuse them with cmp and lookup expressions.

This infrastructure allows for dynamic ruleset updates since the ruleset
blob reduction happens from the kernel.

Userspace still needs to be updated to maximize register utilization to
cooperate to improve register data reuse / reduce number of store on
register operations.
