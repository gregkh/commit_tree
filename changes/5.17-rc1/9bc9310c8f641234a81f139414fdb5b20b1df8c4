PCI: Use PCI_SET_ERROR_RESPONSE() for disconnected devices

A config read from a PCI device that doesn't exist or doesn't respond
causes a PCI error. There's no real data to return to satisfy the CPU read,
so most hardware fabricates ~0 data.

Use PCI_SET_ERROR_RESPONSE() to set the error response when we think the
device has already been disconnected.

This helps unify PCI error response checking and make error checks
consistent and easier to find.
