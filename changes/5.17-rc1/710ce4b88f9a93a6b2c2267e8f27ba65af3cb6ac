crypto: jitter - quit sample collection loop upon RCT failure

The jitterentropy collection loop in jent_gen_entropy() can in principle
run indefinitely without making any progress if it only receives stuck
measurements as determined by jent_stuck(). After 31 consecutive stuck
samples, the Repetition Count Test (RCT) would fail anyway and the
jitterentropy RNG instances moved into ->health_failure == 1 state.
jent_gen_entropy()'s caller, jent_read_entropy() would then check for
this ->health_failure condition and return an error if found set. It
follows that there's absolutely no point in continuing the collection loop
in jent_gen_entropy() once the RCT has failed.

Make the jitterentropy collection loop more robust by terminating it upon
jent_health_failure() so that it won't continue to run indefinitely without
making any progress.
