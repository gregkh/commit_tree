mmc: sdhci-acpi: Remove special handling for GPD win/pocket devices

Remove the special sdhci_acpi_no_fixup_child_power() helper which was
added to avoid triggering an ACPI tables bug on the GPD win/pocket
devices.

The ACPI child-device triggering this bug has now been added to the
acpi_device_override_status() quirk table, so that its status
field is set to all 0 (instead of the wrong return value from the _STA
ACPI method). This removes the need for the special handling in
the sdhci-acpi code.
