ASoC: intel: sof_sdw: move DMIC link id overwrite to create_sdw_dailink

We can apply the fixed dai link id for DMICs in create_sdw_dailink().
No need to set it in each DMIC's callback.
The fixed dai link id is not only for rt715 and rt715-sdca, but for all
DMICs, therefore we remove the SOF_RT715_DAI_ID_FIX check as well.
