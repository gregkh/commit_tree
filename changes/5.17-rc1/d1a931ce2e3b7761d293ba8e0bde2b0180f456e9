cifs: track individual channel status using chans_need_reconnect

We needed a way to identify the channels under the smb session
which are in reconnect, so that the traffic to other channels
can continue. So I replaced the bool need_reconnect with
a bitmask identifying all the channels that need reconnection
(named chans_need_reconnect). When a channel needs reconnection,
the bit corresponding to the index of the server in ses->chans
is used to set this bitmask. Checking if no channels or all
the channels need reconnect then becomes very easy.

Also wrote some helper macros for checking and setting the bits.
