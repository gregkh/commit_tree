ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: remove support for RESUME trigger

The SOF driver removed the support for INFO_RESUME in the commit
"ASoC: SOF: pcm: do not add SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME to runtime hw info".
And resuming is handled by the ALSA core with the .prepare and
.trigger_start stages. So, remove handling of RESUME trigger in the
HDA DAI BE trigger op.
