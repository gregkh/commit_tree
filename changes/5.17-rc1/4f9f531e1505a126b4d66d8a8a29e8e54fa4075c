qed: Use dma_set_mask_and_coherent() and simplify code

Use dma_set_mask_and_coherent() instead of unrolling it with some
dma_set_mask()+dma_set_coherent_mask().

Moreover, as stated in [1], dma_set_mask() with a 64-bit mask will never
fail if dev->dma_mask is non-NULL.
So, if it fails, the 32 bits case will also fail for the same reason.

Simplify code and remove some dead code accordingly.

Now that qed_set_coherency_mask() is mostly a single call to
dma_set_mask_and_coherent(), fold it in its only caller.
