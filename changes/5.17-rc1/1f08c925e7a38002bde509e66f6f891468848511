cachefiles: Implement backing file wrangling

Implement the wrangling of backing files, including the following pieces:

 (1) Lookup and creation of a file on disk, using a tmpfile if the file
     isn't yet present.  The file is then opened, sized for DIO and the
     file handle is attached to the cachefiles_object struct.  The inode is
     marked to indicate that it's in use by a kernel service.

 (2) Invalidation of an object, creating a tmpfile and switching the file
     pointer in the cachefiles object.

 (3) Committing a file to disk, including setting the coherency xattr on it
     and, if necessary, creating a hard link to it.

     Note that this would be a good place to use Omar Sandoval's vfs_link()
     with AT_LINK_REPLACE[1] as I may have to unlink an old file before I
     can link a tmpfile into place.

 (4) Withdrawal of open objects when a cache is being withdrawn or a cookie
     is relinquished.  This involves committing or discarding the file.
