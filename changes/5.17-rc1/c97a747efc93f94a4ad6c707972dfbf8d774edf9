Bluetooth: btusb: Cancel sync commands for certain URB errors

Cancel sync commands when transmission of URBs fail. This is done for
both failures to send a command URB and also when the interrupt URB used
to retrieve a response fails.

This approach is sufficient to quickly deal with certain errors such as
a device being disconnected while synchronous commands are done during
initialization.
