drm/bridge: anx7625: Fix edid_read break case in sp_tx_edid_read()

edid_read() was assumed to return 0 on success. After commit
7f16d0f3b8e2("drm/bridge: anx7625: Propagate errors from sp_tx_rst_aux()"),
the function will return > 0 for successful case, representing the i2c
read bytes. Otherwise -EIO on failure cases. Update the g_edid_break
break condition accordingly.
