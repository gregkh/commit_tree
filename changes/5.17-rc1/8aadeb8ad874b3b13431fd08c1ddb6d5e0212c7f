drm/vmwgfx: Remove the dedicated memory accounting

vmwgfx shared very elaborate memory accounting with ttm. It was moved
from ttm to vmwgfx in change
f07069da6b4c ("drm/ttm: move memory accounting into vmwgfx v4")
but because of complexity it was hard to maintain. Some parts of the code
weren't freeing memory correctly and  some were missing accounting all
together. While those would be fairly easy to fix the fundamental reason
for memory accounting in the driver was the ability to invoke shrinker
which is part of TTM code as well (with support for unified memory
hopefully coming soon).

That meant that vmwgfx had a lot of code that was either unused or
duplicating code from TTM. Removing this code also prevents excessive
calls to global swapout which were common during memory pressure
because both vmwgfx and TTM would invoke the shrinker when memory
usage reached half of RAM.
