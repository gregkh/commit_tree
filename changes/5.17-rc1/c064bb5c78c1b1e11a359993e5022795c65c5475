mmc: sdhci-pci-gli: GL975[50]: Issue 8/16-bit MMIO reads as 32-bit reads.

For some reason, <32-bit reads do not work on Apple ARM64 platforms with
these chips (even though they do on other PCIe devices). Issue them as
32-bit reads instead. This is done unconditionally, as it shouldn't hurt
even if not necessary.
