habanalabs: add support for fetching historic errors

A new uAPI is added for debug purposes of the user-space to retrieve
errors related data from previous session (before device reset was
performed).

Inforamtion is filled when a razwi or CS timeout happens and can
contain one of the following:

1. Retrieve timestamp of last time the device was opened and razwi or
   CS timeout happened.
2. Retrieve information about last CS timeout.
3. Retrieve information about last razwi error.

This information doesn't contain user data, so no danger of data
leakage between users.
