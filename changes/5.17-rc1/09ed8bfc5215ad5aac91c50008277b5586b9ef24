wilc1000: Rename workqueue from "WILC_wq" to "NETDEV-wq"

This follows normal Linux convention and is more useful since the new
name will make it apparent which network device the work-queue is for
(e.g., the name will be "wlan0-wq" for network device "wlan0").

hif_workqueue allocation has to move from
cfg80211.c:wilc_cfg80211_init() to netdev.c:wilc_netdev_ifc_init()
because the network device name is not known until after the netdev is
registered.  The move also makes sense because netdev.c is already
responsible for destroying the work queue when it is no longer needed.
