fs: port higher-level mapping helpers

Enable the mapped_fs{g,u}id() helpers to support filesystems mounted
with an idmapping. Apart from core mapping helpers that use
mapped_fs{g,u}id() to initialize struct inode's i_{g,u}id fields xfs is
the only place that uses these low-level helpers directly.

The patch only extends the helpers to be able to take the filesystem
idmapping into account. Since we don't actually yet pass the
filesystem's idmapping in no functional changes happen. This will happen
in a final patch.
