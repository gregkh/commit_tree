fs: move dcache sysctls to its own file

kernel/sysctl.c is a kitchen sink where everyone leaves their dirty
dishes, this makes it very difficult to maintain.

To help with this maintenance let's start by moving sysctls to places
where they actually belong.  The proc sysctl maintainers do not want to
know what sysctl knobs you wish to add for your own piece of code, we
just care about the core logic.

So move the dcache sysctl clutter out of kernel/sysctl.c.  This is a
small one-off entry, perhaps later we can simplify this representation,
but for now we use the helpers we have.  We won't know how we can
simplify this further untl we're fully done with the cleanup.
