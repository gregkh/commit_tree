spi: Fix condition in the __spi_register_driver()

The recent commit 3f07657506df ("spi: deduplicate spi_match_id()
in __spi_register_driver()") inadvertently inverted a condition
that provokes a (harmless) warning:

  WARNING KERN SPI driver mtd_dataflash has no spi_device_id for atmel,at45

Restore logic to avoid such warning to be issued.
