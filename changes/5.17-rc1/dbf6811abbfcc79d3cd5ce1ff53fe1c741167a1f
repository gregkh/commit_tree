Bluetooth: Limit duration of Remote Name Resolve

When doing remote name request, we cannot scan. In the normal case it's
OK since we can expect it to finish within a short amount of time.
However, there is a possibility to scan lots of devices that
(1) requires Remote Name Resolve
(2) is unresponsive to Remote Name Resolve
When this happens, we are stuck to do Remote Name Resolve until all is
done before continue scanning.

This patch adds a time limit to stop us spending too long on remote
name request.
