ext4: fast commit may miss tracking unwritten range during ftruncate

If use FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE to alloc unwritten range at bottom, the
inode->i_size will not include the unwritten range. When call
ftruncate with fast commit enabled, it will miss to track the
unwritten range.

Change to trace the full range during ftruncate.
