dt-bindings: iio: add AD74413R

The AD74412R and AD74413R are quad-channel, software configurable,
input/output solutions for building and process control applications.

They contain functionality for analog output, analog input, digital input,
resistance temperature detector, and thermocouple measurements integrated
into a single chip solution with an SPI interface.

The devices feature a 16-bit ADC and four configurable 13-bit DACs to
provide four configurable input/output channels and a suite of diagnostic
functions.

The AD74413R differentiates itself from the AD74412R by being
HART-compatible.
