drm/amdgpu: Use correct VIEWPORT_DIMENSION for DCN2

For some reason this file isn't using the appropriate register
headers for DCN headers, which means that on DCN2 we're getting
the VIEWPORT_DIMENSION offset wrong.

This means that we're not correctly carving out the framebuffer
memory correctly for a framebuffer allocated by EFI and
therefore see corruption when loading amdgpu before the display
driver takes over control of the framebuffer scanout.

Fix this by checking the DCE_HWIP and picking the correct offset
accordingly.

Long-term we should expose this info from DC as GMC shouldn't
need to know about DCN registers.
