drm/exynos: drop the use of label from exynos_dsi_register_te_irq

Dropped the use of 'out' label from exynos_dsi_register_te_irq function
because the label isn't needed. This patch returns an error in each
error case directly not going to 'out' label.

With this patch build warning[1] is also fixed, which was reported by
