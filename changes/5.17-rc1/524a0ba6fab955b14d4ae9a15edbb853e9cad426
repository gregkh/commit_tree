drm/amd/display: Fix DPIA outbox timeout after GPU reset

[Why]
The HW interrupt gets disabled after GPU reset so we don't receive
notifications for HPD or AUX from DMUB - leading to timeout and
black screen with (or without) DPIA links connected.

[How]
Re-enable the interrupt after GPU reset like we do for the other
DC interrupts.
