can: mcp251xfd: mcp251xfd_open(): open_candev() first

This patch exchanges the order of open_candev() and
pm_runtime_get_sync(), so that open_candev() is called first.

A usual reason why open_candev() fails is missing CAN bit rate
configuration. It makes no sense to resume the device from PM sleep
first just to put it to sleep if the bit rate is not configured.
