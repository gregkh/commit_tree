drm/mipi-dbi: Remove dependency on GEM CMA helper library

The MIPI DBI helpers access struct drm_gem_cma_object.vaddr in a
few places. Replace all instances with the correct generic GEM
functions. Use drm_gem_fb_vmap() for mapping a framebuffer's GEM
objects and drm_gem_fb_vunmap() for unmapping them. This removes
the dependency on CMA helpers within MIPI DBI.
