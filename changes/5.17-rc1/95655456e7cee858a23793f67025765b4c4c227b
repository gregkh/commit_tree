Bluetooth: btintel: Fix broken LED quirk for legacy ROM devices

This patch fixes the broken LED quirk for Intel legacy ROM devices.
To fix the LED issue that doesn't turn off immediately, the host sends
the SW RFKILL command while shutting down the interface and it puts the
devices in SW RFKILL state.

Once the device is in SW RFKILL state, it can only accept HCI_Reset to
exit from the SW RFKILL state. This patch checks the quirk for broken
LED and sends the HCI_Reset before sending the HCI_Intel_Read_Version
command.

The affected legacy ROM devices are
 - 8087:07dc
 - 8087:0a2a
 - 8087:0aa7
