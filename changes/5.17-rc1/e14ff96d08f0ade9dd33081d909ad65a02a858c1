powerpc/pseries: Add __init attribute to eligible functions

Some functions defined in 'arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries' are
deserving of an `__init` macro attribute. These functions are only
called by other initialization functions and therefore should inherit
the attribute.
Also, change function declarations in header files to include `__init`.
