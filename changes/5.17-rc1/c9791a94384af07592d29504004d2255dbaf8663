iio: adc: ti-adc081c: Partial revert of removal of ACPI IDs

Unfortuanately a non standards compliant ACPI ID is known to be
in the wild on some AAEON boards.

Partly revert the removal of these IDs so that ADC081C will again
work + add a comment to that affect for future reference.

Whilst here use generic firmware properties rather than the ACPI
specific handling previously found in this driver.
