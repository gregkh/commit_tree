drm/i915/ttm: ensure we unmap when purging

Purging can happen during swapping out, or directly invoked with the
madvise ioctl. In such cases this doesn't involve a ttm move, which
skips umapping the object.

v2(Thomas):
- add ttm_truncate helper, and just call into i915_ttm_move_notify() to
  handle the unmapping step
