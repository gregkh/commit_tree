KVM: Update halt-polling stats if and only if halt-polling was attempted

Don't update halt-polling stats if halt-polling wasn't attempted.  This is
a nop as @poll_ns is guaranteed to be '0' (poll_end == start); in a future
patch (to move the histogram stats into the helper), it will avoid to
avoid a discrepancy in what is considered a "successful" halt-poll.

No functional change intended.
