parisc: pdc_stable: Fix memory leak in pdcs_register_pathentries

kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails.
According to the doc of kobject_init_and_add()ï¼š

   If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to
   properly clean up the memory associated with the object.

Fix memory leak by calling kobject_put().
