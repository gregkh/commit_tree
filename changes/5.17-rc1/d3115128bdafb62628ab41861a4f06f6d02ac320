MIPS: ath79: drop _machine_restart again

Commit 81424d0ad0d4 ("MIPS: ath79: Use the reset controller to restart
OF machines") removed setup of _machine_restart on OF machines to use
reset handler in reset controller driver.
While removing remnants of non-OF machines in commit 3a77e0d75eed
("MIPS: ath79: drop machfiles"), this was introduced again, making it
impossible to use additional restart handlers registered through device
tree. Drop setting _machine_restart altogether, and ath79_restart
function, which is no longer used after this.
