Documentation/auxiliary_bus: Move the text into the code

The code and documentation are more difficult to maintain when kept
separately.  This is further compounded when the standard structure
documentation infrastructure is not used.

Move the documentation into the code, use the standard documentation
infrastructure, add current documented functions, and reference the text
in the rst file.
