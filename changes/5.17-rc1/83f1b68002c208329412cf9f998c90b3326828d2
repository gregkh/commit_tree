btrfs: remove unnecessary @nr_written parameters

We use @nr_written to record how many pages have been started by
btrfs_run_delalloc_range().

Currently there are only two cases that would populate @nr_written:

- Inline extent creation
- Compressed write

But both cases will also set @page_started to one.

In fact, in writepage_delalloc() we have the following code, showing
that @nr_written is really only utilized for above two cases:

	/* did the fill delalloc function already unlock and start
	 * the IO?
	 */
	if (page_started) {
		/*
		 * we've unlocked the page, so we can't update
		 * the mapping's writeback index, just update
		 * nr_to_write.
		 */
		wbc->nr_to_write -= nr_written;
		return 1;
	}

But for such cases, writepage_delalloc() will return 1, and exit
__extent_writepage() without going through __extent_writepage_io().

Thus this means, inside __extent_writepage_io(), we always get
@nr_written as 0.

So this patch is going to remove the unnecessary parameter from the
following functions:

- writepage_delalloc()

  As @nr_written passed in is always the initial value 0.

  Although inside that function, we still need a local @nr_written
  to update wbc->nr_to_write.

- __extent_writepage_io()

  As explained above, @nr_written passed in can only be 0.

  This also means we can remove one update_nr_written() call.
