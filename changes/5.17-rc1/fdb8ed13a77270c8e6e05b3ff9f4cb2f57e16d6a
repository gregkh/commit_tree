scsi: mpt3sas: Use irq_set_affinity_and_hint()

The driver uses irq_set_affinity_hint() specifically for the high IOPS
queue interrupts for two purposes:

 - To set the affinity_hint which is consumed by the userspace for
   distributing the interrupts

 - To apply an affinity that it provides

The driver enforces its own affinity to bind the high IOPS queue interrupts
to the local NUMA node. However, irq_set_affinity_hint() applying the
provided cpumask as an affinity (if not NULL) for the interrupt is an
undocumented side effect.

To remove this side effect irq_set_affinity_hint() has been marked
as deprecated and new interfaces have been introduced. Hence, replace the
irq_set_affinity_hint() with the new interface irq_set_affinity_and_hint()
where the provided mask needs to be applied as the affinity and
affinity_hint pointer needs to be set and replace with
irq_update_affinity_hint() where only affinity_hint needs to be updated.
