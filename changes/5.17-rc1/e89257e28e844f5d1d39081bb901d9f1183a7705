powerpc/cell: Fix clang -Wimplicit-fallthrough warning

Clang warns:

arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/pervasive.c:81:2: error: unannotated fall-through between switch labels
        case SRR1_WAKEEE:
        ^
arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/pervasive.c:81:2: note: insert 'break;' to avoid fall-through
        case SRR1_WAKEEE:
        ^
        break;
1 error generated.

Clang is more pedantic than GCC, which does not warn when failing
through to a case that is just break or return. Clang's version is more
in line with the kernel's own stance in deprecated.rst. Add athe missing
break to silence the warning.
