bpf: Disallow BPF_LOG_KERNEL log level for bpf(BPF_BTF_LOAD)

BPF_LOG_KERNEL is only used internally, so disallow bpf_btf_load()
to set log level as BPF_LOG_KERNEL. The same checking has already
been done in bpf_check(), so factor out a helper to check the
validity of log attributes and use it in both places.
