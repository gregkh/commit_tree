leds: simatic-ipc-leds: add new driver for Siemens Industial PCs

This driver adds initial support for several devices from Siemens. It is
based on a platform driver introduced in an earlier commit.

One of the supported machines has GPIO connected LEDs, here we poke GPIO
memory directly because pinctrl does not come up.
