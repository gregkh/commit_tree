thunderbolt: Add CL0s support for USB4 routers

In this patch we add enabling of CL0s - a low power state of the link.
Low power states (called collectively CLx) are used to reduce
transmitter and receiver power when a high-speed lane is idle. For now,
we add support only for first low power state: CL0s.  We enable it, if
both sides of the link support it, and only for the first hop router.
(i.e. the first device that connected to the host router). This is
needed for better thermal management.
