KVM: selftests: arm64: Introduce a variable default IPA size

Contrary to popular belief, there is no such thing as a default
IPA size on arm64. Anything goes, and implementations are the
usual Wild West.

The selftest infrastructure default to 40bit IPA, which obviously
doesn't work for some systems out there.

Turn VM_MODE_DEFAULT from a constant into a variable, and let
guest_modes_append_default() populate it, depending on what
the HW can do. In order to preserve the current behaviour, we
still pick 40bits IPA as the default if it is available, and
the largest supported IPA space otherwise.
