rcutorture: Enable multiple concurrent callback-flood kthreads

This commit converts the rcutorture.fwd_progress module parameter from
bool to int, so that it specifies the number of callback-flood kthreads.
Values less than zero specify one kthread per CPU, however, the number of
kthreads executing concurrently is limited to the number of online CPUs.
This commit also reverse the order of the need-resched and callback-flood
operations to cause the callback flooding to happen more nearly at the
same time.
