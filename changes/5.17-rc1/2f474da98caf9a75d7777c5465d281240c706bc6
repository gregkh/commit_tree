arm64: dts: ti: k3-am642-evm/sk: Add support for main domain mcan nodes in EVM and disable them on SK

AM642 EVM has two CAN connecters brought out from the two MCAN instances in
the main domain through transceivers. Add device tree nodes for
transceivers and set the required properties in the mcan device tree nodes,
in EVM device tree file.

On AM642 SK there are no connectors brought out for CAN. Therefore, disable
the mcan device tree nodes in the SK device tree file.
