tracing: Account bottom half disabled sections.

Disabling only bottom halves via local_bh_disable() disables also
preemption but this remains invisible to tracing. On a CONFIG_PREEMPT
kernel one might wonder why there is no scheduling happening despite the
N flag in the trace. The reason might be the a rcu_read_lock_bh()
section.

Add a 'b' to the tracing output if in task context with disabled bottom
halves.
