crypto: stm32/cryp - fix lrw chaining mode

This fixes the lrw autotest if lrw uses the CRYP as the AES block cipher
provider (as ecb(aes)). At end of request, CRYP should not update the IV
in case of ECB chaining mode. Indeed the ECB chaining mode never uses
the IV, but the software LRW chaining mode uses the IV field as
a counter and due to the (unexpected) update done by CRYP while the AES
block process, the counter get a wrong value when the IV overflow.
