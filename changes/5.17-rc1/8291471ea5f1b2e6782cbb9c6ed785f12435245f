cgroup: get the wrong css for css_alloc() during cgroup_init_subsys()

css_alloc() needs the parent css, while cgroup_css() gets current
cgropu's css. So we are getting the wrong css during
cgroup_init_subsys().

Fortunately, cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp's css is not set yet, so the value we
pass to css_alloc() is NULL anyway.

Let's pass NULL directly during init, since we know there is no parent
yet.
