ceph: don't check for quotas on MDS stray dirs

玮文 胡 reported seeing the WARN_RATELIMIT pop when writing to an
inode that had been transplanted into the stray dir. The client was
trying to look up the quotarealm info from the parent and that tripped
the warning.

Change the ceph_vino_is_reserved helper to not throw a warning for
MDS stray directories (0x100 - 0x1ff), only for reserved dirs that
are not in that range.

Also, fix ceph_has_realms_with_quotas to return false when encountering
a reserved inode.
