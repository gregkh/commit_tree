btrfs: change root to fs_info for btrfs_reserve_metadata_bytes

We used to need the root for btrfs_reserve_metadata_bytes to check the
orphan cleanup state, but we no longer need that, we simply need the
fs_info.  Change btrfs_reserve_metadata_bytes() to use the fs_info, and
change both btrfs_block_rsv_refill() and btrfs_block_rsv_add() to do the
same as they simply call btrfs_reserve_metadata_bytes() and then
manipulate the block_rsv that is being used.
