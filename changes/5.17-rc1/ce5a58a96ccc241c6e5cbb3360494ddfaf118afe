scsi: lpfc: Use irq_set_affinity()

The driver uses irq_set_affinity_hint to set the affinity for the lpfc
interrupts to a mask corresponding to the local NUMA node to avoid
performance overhead on AMD architectures.

However, irq_set_affinity_hint() setting the affinity is an undocumented
side effect that this function also sets the affinity under the hood.
To remove this side effect irq_set_affinity_hint() has been marked as
deprecated and new interfaces have been introduced.

Also, as per the commit dcaa21367938 ("scsi: lpfc: Change default IRQ model
on AMD architectures"):
"On AMD architecture, revert the irq allocation to the normal style
(non-managed) and then use irq_set_affinity_hint() to set the cpu affinity
and disable user-space rebalancing."
we don't really need to set the affinity_hint as user-space rebalancing for
the lpfc interrupts is not desired.

Hence, replace the irq_set_affinity_hint() with irq_set_affinity() which
only applies the affinity for the interrupts.
