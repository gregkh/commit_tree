codel: remove unnecessary pkt_sched.h include

Commit d068ca2ae2e6 ("codel: split into multiple files") moved all
Qdisc-related code to codel_qdisc.h, move the include of pkt_sched.h
as well.

This is similar to the previous commit, although we don't care as
much about incremental builds after pkt_sched.h was touched itself
it is included by net/sch_generic.h which is modified ~20 times
a year.

This decreases the incremental build size after touching pkt_sched.h
from 1592 to 617 objects.

Fix unmasked missing includes in WiFi drivers.
