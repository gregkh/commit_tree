PCI: pciehp: Fix infinite loop in IRQ handler upon power fault

The Power Fault Detected bit in the Slot Status register differs from
all other hotplug events in that it is sticky:  It can only be cleared
after turning off slot power.  Per PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.7.1.8:

  If a power controller detects a main power fault on the hot-plug slot,
  it must automatically set its internal main power fault latch [...].
  The main power fault latch is cleared when software turns off power to
  the hot-plug slot.

The stickiness used to cause interrupt storms and infinite loops which
were fixed in 2009 by commits 5651c48cfafe ("PCI pciehp: fix power fault
interrupt storm problem") and 99f0169c17f3 ("PCI: pciehp: enable
software notification on empty slots").

Unfortunately in 2020 the infinite loop issue was inadvertently
reintroduced by commit 8edf5332c393 ("PCI: pciehp: Fix MSI interrupt
race"):  The hardirq handler pciehp_isr() clears the PFD bit until
pciehp's power_fault_detected flag is set.  That happens in the IRQ
thread pciehp_ist(), which never learns of the event because the hardirq
handler is stuck in an infinite loop.  Fix by setting the
power_fault_detected flag already in the hardirq handler.
