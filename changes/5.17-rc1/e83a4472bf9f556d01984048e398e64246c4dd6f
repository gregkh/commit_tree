panic: remove oops_id

The oops id has been added as part of the end of trace marker for the
kerneloops.org project.  The id is used to automatically identify
duplicate submissions of the same report.  Identical looking reports
with different a id can be considered as the same oops occurred again.

The early initialisation of the oops_id can create a warning if the
random core is not yet fully initialized.  On PREEMPT_RT it is
problematic if the id is initialized on demand from non preemptible
context.

The kernel oops project is not available since 2017.  Remove the oops_id
and use 0 in the output in case parser rely on it.
