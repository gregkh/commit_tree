Revert "drm/i915/bios: gracefully disable dual eDP for now"

This reverts commit 05734ca2a8f76c9eb3890b3c9dfc3467f03105c1.

It's not graceful, instead it leads to boot time warning splats in the
case it is supposed to handle gracefully. Apparently the BIOS/GOP
enabling the port we end up skipping leads to state readout
problems. Back to the drawing board.
