powerpc: handle kdump appropriately with crash_kexec_post_notifiers option

Kdump can be triggered after panic_notifers since commit f06e5153f4ae2
("kernel/panic.c: add "crash_kexec_post_notifiers" option for kdump
after panic_notifers") introduced crash_kexec_post_notifiers option.
But using this option would mean smp_send_stop(), that marks all other
CPUs as offline, gets called before kdump is triggered. As a result,
kdump routines fail to save other CPUs' registers. To fix this, kdump
friendly crash_smp_send_stop() function was introduced with kernel
commit 0ee59413c967 ("x86/panic: replace smp_send_stop() with kdump
friendly version in panic path"). Override this kdump friendly weak
function to handle crash_kexec_post_notifiers option appropriately
on powerpc.
