net: ipa: prevent concurrent replenish

We have seen cases where an endpoint RX completion interrupt arrives
while replenishing for the endpoint is underway.  This causes another
instance of replenishing to begin as part of completing the receive
transaction.  If this occurs it can lead to transaction corruption.

Use a new flag to ensure only one replenish instance for an endpoint
executes at a time.
