mips: fix Kconfig reference to PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT

Commit d4a451d5fc84 ("arch: remove the ARCH_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT config
symbol") removes config ARCH_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT with all instances of that
config refactored appropriately. Since then, it is recommended to use the
config PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT instead.

Commit 171543e75272 ("MIPS: Disallow CPU_SUPPORTS_HUGEPAGES for XPA,EVA")
introduces the expression "!(32BIT && (ARCH_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT || EVA))"
for config CPU_SUPPORTS_HUGEPAGES, which unintentionally refers to the
non-existing symbol ARCH_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT instead of the intended
PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT.

Fix this Kconfig reference to the intended PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT.

This issue was identified with the script ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py.
I then reported it on the mailing list and Paul confirmed the mistake in
the linked email thread.
