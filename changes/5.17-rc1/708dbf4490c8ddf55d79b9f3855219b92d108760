soc: qcom: stats: Add fixed sleep stats offset for older RPM firmwares

Not all RPM firmware versions have the dynamic sleep stats offset
available. Most older versions use a fixed offset of 0xdba0.
Add support for this using new SoC-specific compatibles for APQ8084,
MSM8226, MSM8916 and MSM8974.

Even older SoCs seem to use a different offset and stats format.
If needed those could be supported in the future by adding separate
compatibles for those with a different stats_config.
