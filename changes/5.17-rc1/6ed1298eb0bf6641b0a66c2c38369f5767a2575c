KVM: x86/pmu: Reuse pmc_perf_hw_id() and drop find_fixed_event()

Since we set the same semantic event value for the fixed counter in
pmc->eventsel, returning the perf_hw_id for the fixed counter via
find_fixed_event() can be painlessly replaced by pmc_perf_hw_id()
with the help of pmc_is_fixed() check.
