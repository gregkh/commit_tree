gre: Don't accidentally set RTO_ONLINK in gre_fill_metadata_dst()

Mask the ECN bits before initialising ->flowi4_tos. The tunnel key may
have the last ECN bit set, which will interfere with the route lookup
process as ip_route_output_key_hash() interpretes this bit specially
(to restrict the route scope).

Found by code inspection, compile tested only.
