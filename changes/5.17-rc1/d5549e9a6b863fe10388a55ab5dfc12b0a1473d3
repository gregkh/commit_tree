ath11k: Use memset_startat() for clearing queue descriptors

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memset(), avoid intentionally writing across
neighboring fields.

Use memset_startat() so memset() doesn't get confused about writing
beyond the destination member that is intended to be the starting point
of zeroing through the end of the struct. Additionally split up a later
field-spanning memset() so that memset() can reason about the size.
