drm/i915: Move intel_ddi_fdi_post_disable() to fdi code

Reanme intel_ddi_fdi_post_disable() to hsw_fdi_disable() and
relocate it next to all the other code dealing with FDI_RX.
intel_ddi.c has now been cleansed of FDI_RX.

In order to avoid exposing intel_disable_ddi_buf() outside
intel_ddi.c we can just open code the DDI_BUF_CTL write. The
enable side already has all that stuff open coded so
this actually is more symmetric. But we do need to remeber
to bring the intel_wait_ddi_buf_idle() call over from
inside intel_disable_ddi_buf().
