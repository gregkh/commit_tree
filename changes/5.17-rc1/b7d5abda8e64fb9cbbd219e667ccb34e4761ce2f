drm/i915/dp: use new link training delay helpers

Use the new link training delay helpers, fixing the delays for
128b/132b.

For existing 8b/10b functionality, this will cause additional 1-byte
DPCD reads for LTTPR delays instead of using the cached values. It's
just too complicated to combine generic helpers with local caching in a
sensible way.
