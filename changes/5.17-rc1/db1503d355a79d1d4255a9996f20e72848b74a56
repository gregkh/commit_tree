riscv: Get rid of MAXPHYSMEM configs

CONFIG_MAXPHYSMEM_* are actually never used, even the nommu defconfigs
selecting the MAXPHYSMEM_2GB had no effects on PAGE_OFFSET since it was
preempted by !MMU case right before.

In addition, the move of the kernel mapping at the end of the address
space broke the use of MAXPHYSMEM_2G with MMU since it defines PAGE_OFFSET
at the same address as the kernel mapping.
