platform/x86: wmi: Add no_notify_data flag to struct wmi_driver

Some WMI implementations do notifies on WMI objects without a _WED method
allow WMI drivers to indicate that _WED should not be called for notifies
on the WMI objects the driver is bound to.

Instead the driver's notify callback will simply be called with a NULL
data argument.
