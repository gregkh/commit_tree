crypto: qat - add support for compression for 4xxx

Add the logic required to enable the compression service for 4xxx devices.
This allows to load the compression firmware image and report
the appropriate compression capabilities.

The firmware image selection for a given device is based on the
'ServicesEnabled' key stored in the internal configuration, which is
added statically at the probe of the device according to the following
rule, by default:
- odd numbered devices assigned to compression services
- even numbered devices assigned to crypto services

In addition, restore the 'ServicesEnabled' key, if present, when SRIOV
is enabled on the device.
