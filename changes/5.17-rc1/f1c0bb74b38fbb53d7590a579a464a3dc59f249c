iwlwifi: Read the correct addresses when getting the crf id

The original implementation checked the HW family, and as a result
of that used different addresses for the prph registers.

The old HWs addresses start with 0xa****** and the newer
ones start with 0xd******.

For this there are iwl_read/write_umac_prph functions that just add the

diff in the address automatically (in this case 0x300000), so the code will
be common for all HWs

In the original implementation the address given already had the 0xd******
causing the address to become 0x10***** (after adding the offset)

Change the registers to start with 0xa*****.
