bpftool: Add SPDX tags to RST documentation files

Most files in the kernel repository have a SPDX tags. The files that
don't have such a tag (or another license boilerplate) tend to fall
under the GPL-2.0 license. In the past, bpftool's Makefile (for example)
has been marked as GPL-2.0 for that reason, when in fact all bpftool is
dual-licensed.

To prevent a similar confusion from happening with the RST documentation
files for bpftool, let's explicitly mark all files as dual-licensed.
