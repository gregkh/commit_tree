x86/alternative: Relax text_poke_bp() constraint

Currently, text_poke_bp() is very strict to only allow patching a
single instruction; however with straight-line-speculation it will be
required to patch: ret; int3, which is two instructions.

As such, relax the constraints a little to allow int3 padding for all
instructions that do not imply the execution of the next instruction,
ie: RET, JMP.d8 and JMP.d32.

While there, rename the text_poke_loc::rel32 field to ::disp.

Note: this fills up the text_poke_loc structure which is now a round
  16 bytes big.
