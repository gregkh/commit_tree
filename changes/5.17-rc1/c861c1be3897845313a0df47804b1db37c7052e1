clk: bm1880: remove kfrees on static allocations

bm1880_clk_unregister_pll & bm1880_clk_unregister_div both try to
free statically allocated variables, so remove those kfrees.

For example, if we take L703 kfree(div_hw):
- div_hw is a bm1880_div_hw_clock pointer
- in bm1880_clk_register_plls this is pointed to an element of arg1:
  struct bm1880_div_hw_clock *clks
- in the probe, where bm1880_clk_register_plls is called arg1 is
  bm1880_div_clks, defined on L371:
  static struct bm1880_div_hw_clock bm1880_div_clks[]
