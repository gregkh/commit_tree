btrfs: only call inode_sub_bytes in truncate paths that care

We currently have a bunch of awkward checks to make sure we only update
the inode i_bytes if we're truncating the real inode.  Instead keep
track of the number of bytes we need to sub in the
btrfs_truncate_control, and then do the appropriate adjustment in the
truncate paths that care.
