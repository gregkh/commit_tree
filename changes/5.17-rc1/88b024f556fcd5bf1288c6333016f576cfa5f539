cifs: protect all accesses to chan_* with chan_lock

A spin lock called chan_lock was introduced recently.
But not all accesses were protected. Doing that with
this change.

To make sure that a channel is not freed when in use,
we need to introduce a ref count. But today, we don't
ever free channels.
