docs: allow selecting a Sphinx theme

Instead of having RTD as an almost mandatory theme, allow the
user to select other themes via DOCS_THEME environment var.

There's a catch, though: as the current theme override logic is
dependent of the RTD theme, we need to move the code which
adds the CSS overrides to be inside the RTD theme logic.
