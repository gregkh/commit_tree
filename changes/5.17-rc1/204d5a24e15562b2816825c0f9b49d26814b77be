fs: move fs stat sysctls to file_table.c

kernel/sysctl.c is a kitchen sink where everyone leaves their dirty
dishes, this makes it very difficult to maintain.

To help with this maintenance let's start by moving sysctls to places
where they actually belong.  The proc sysctl maintainers do not want to
know what sysctl knobs you wish to add for your own piece of code, we
just care about the core logic.

We can create the sysctl dynamically on early init for fs stat to help
with this clutter.  This dusts off the fs stat syctls knobs and puts
them into where they are declared.
