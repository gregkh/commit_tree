ACPI: processor idle: Use swap() instead of open coding it

Address the following coccicheck warning:

./drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en/tc_ct.c:914:40-41:
WARNING opportunity for swap().

by using swap() for the swapping of variable values and drop
the tmp variable that is not needed any more.
