MIPS: Makefile: Remove "ifdef need-compiler" for Kbuild.platforms

After commit 13ceb48bc19c ("MIPS: Loongson2ef: Remove unnecessary
{as,cc}-option calls"), no need to use "ifdef need-compiler" for
Kbuild.platforms, because the cause of the build issue mentioned
in commit 0706f74f719e ("MIPS: fix *-pkg builds for loongson2ef
platform") has been disappeared, so just remove it.
