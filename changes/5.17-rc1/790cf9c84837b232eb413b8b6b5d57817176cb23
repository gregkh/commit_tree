block: Provide blk_mq_sched_get_icq()

Currently we lookup ICQ only after the request is allocated. However BFQ
will want to decide how many scheduler tags it allows a given bfq queue
(effectively a process) to consume based on cgroup weight. So provide a
function blk_mq_sched_get_icq() so that BFQ can lookup ICQ earlier.
