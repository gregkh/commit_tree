crypto: drbg - make drbg_prepare_hrng() handle jent instantiation errors

Now that drbg_prepare_hrng() doesn't do anything but to instantiate a
jitterentropy crypto_rng instance, it looks a little odd to have the
related error handling at its only caller, drbg_instantiate().

Move the handling of jitterentropy allocation failures from
drbg_instantiate() close to the allocation itself in drbg_prepare_hrng().

There is no change in behaviour.
