arm64: tegra: Add OPP tables on Tegra132

Add peripheral OPP tables on Tegra132 and wire them up to ACTMON and the
EMC. While at it, add the missing "#interconnect-cells" properties to
the memory controller and external memory controller nodes. Also set the
"#reset-cells" property for the memory controller because it exports the
hotflush reset controls.
