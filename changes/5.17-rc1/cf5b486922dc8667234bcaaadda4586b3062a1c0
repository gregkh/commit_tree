KVM: s390: Use "new" memslot instead of userspace memory region

Get the gfn, size, and hva from the new memslot instead of the userspace
memory region when preparing/committing memory region changes.  This will
allow a future commit to drop the @mem param.

Note, this has a subtle functional change as KVM would previously reject
DELETE if userspace provided a garbage userspace_addr or guest_phys_addr,
whereas KVM zeros those fields in the "new" memslot when deleting an
existing memslot.  Arguably the old behavior is more correct, but there's
zero benefit into requiring userspace to provide sane values for hva and
gfn.
