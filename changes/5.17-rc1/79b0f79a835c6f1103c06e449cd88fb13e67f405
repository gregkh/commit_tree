mmc: don't set GENHD_FL_SUPPRESS_PARTITION_INFO

This manually reverts 07b652cdbec3 ("mmc: card: Don't show eMMC RPMB and
BOOT areas in /proc/partitions").  Based on the commit description that
change was purely cosmetic.  mmc is the last driver that sets this
flag and thus prevents it from being removed.
