selftests/powerpc/spectre_v2: Return skip code when miss_percent is high

A mis-match between reported and actual mitigation is not restricted to the
Vulnerable case. The guest might also report the mitigation as "Software
count cache flush" and the host will still mitigate with branch cache
disabled.

So, instead of skipping depending on the detected mitigation, simply skip
whenever the detected miss_percent is the expected one for a fully
mitigated system, that is, above 95%.
