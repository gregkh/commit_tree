SUNRPC: discard svo_setup and rename svc_set_num_threads_sync()

The ->svo_setup callback serves no purpose.  It is always called from
within the same module that chooses which callback is needed.  So
discard it and call the relevant function directly.

Now that svc_set_num_threads() is no longer used remove it and rename
svc_set_num_threads_sync() to remove the "_sync" suffix.
