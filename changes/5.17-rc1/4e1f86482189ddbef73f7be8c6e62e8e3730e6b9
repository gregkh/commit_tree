ASoC: SOF: Introduce new firmware state: SOF_FW_CRASHED

The SOF_FW_CRASHED state is meant to indicate the unfortunate case when the
firmware has crashed after a successful boot.

IPC tx timeout is not treated as indication of a firmware crash as it tends
to happen regularly while the firmware is operational.
