ath11k: add support for hardware rfkill for QCA6390

When hardware rfkill is enabled in the firmware it will report the
capability via using WMI_SYS_CAP_INFO_RFKILL bit in the WMI_SERVICE_READY
event to the host. ath11k will check the capability, and if it is enabled then
ath11k will set the GPIO information to firmware using WMI_PDEV_SET_PARAM. When
the firmware detects hardware rfkill is enabled by the user, it will report it
via WMI_RFKILL_STATE_CHANGE_EVENTID. Once ath11k receives the event it will
send wmi command WMI_PDEV_SET_PARAM to the firmware and also notifies cfg80211.

This only enable rfkill feature for QCA6390, rfkill_pin is all initialized to 0
for other chips in ath11k_hw_params.

Tested-on: QCA6390 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HST.1.0.1-01740-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1
