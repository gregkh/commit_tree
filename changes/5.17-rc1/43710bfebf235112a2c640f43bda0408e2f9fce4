net: hns3: create new common cmd code for PF and VF modules

Currently PF and VF use two sets of command code for modules to interact
with firmware. These codes values are same espect the macro names. It is
redundent to keep two sets of command code for same functions between PF
and VF.

So this patch firstly creates a unified command code for PF and VF module.
We keep the macro name same with the PF command code name to avoid too many
meaningless modifications. Secondly the new common command codes are used
to replace the old ones in VF and deletes the old ones.
