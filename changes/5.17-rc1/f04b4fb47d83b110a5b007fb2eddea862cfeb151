ASoC: sh: rz-ssi: Check return value of pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

The return value of pm_runtime_resume_and_get() needs to be checked to
avoid a usage count imbalance in the error case. This fix is basically
the same as 92c959bae2e5 ("reset: renesas: Fix Runtime PM usage"),
and the last step before pm_runtime_resume_and_get() can be annotated
as __must_check.
