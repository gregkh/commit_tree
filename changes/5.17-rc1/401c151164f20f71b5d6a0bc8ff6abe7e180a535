dt-bindings: renesas,rcar-dmac: Add r8a779f0 support

Document the compatible value for the Direct Memory Access Controller
blocks in the Renesas R-Car S4-8 (R8A779F0) SoC.

The most visible difference with DMAC blocks on other R-Car SoCs
(except R8A779A0) is the move of the per-channel registers to
a separate register block.
