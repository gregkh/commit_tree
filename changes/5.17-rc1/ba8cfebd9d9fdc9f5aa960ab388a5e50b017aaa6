platform/x86: system76_acpi: Guard System76 EC specific functionality

Certain functionality or its implementation in System76 EC firmware may
be different to the proprietary ODM EC firmware. Introduce a new bool,
`has_open_ec`, to guard our specific logic. Detect the use of this by
looking for a custom ACPI method name used in System76 firmware.
