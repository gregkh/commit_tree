scsi: core: Simplify control flow in scmd_eh_abort_handler()

Simplify the nested conditionals in the function by using a label for the
error path.  Introduce local "shost" to avoid repeated "sdev->shost" usage.
Also remove scsi_eh_complete_abort() since there is now only one place it
would be called.
