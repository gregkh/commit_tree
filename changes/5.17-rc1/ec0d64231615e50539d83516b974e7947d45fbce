dmaengine: idxd: embed irq_entry in idxd_wq struct

With irq_entry already being associated with the wq in a 1:1 relationship,
embed the irq_entry in the idxd_wq struct and remove back pointers for
idxe_wq and idxd_device. In the process of this work, clean up the interrupt
handle assignment so that there's no decision to be made during submit
call on where interrupt handle value comes from. Set the interrupt handle
during irq request initialization time.

irq_entry 0 is designated as special and is tied to the device itself.
