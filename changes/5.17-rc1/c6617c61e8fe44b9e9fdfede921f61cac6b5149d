KVM: x86: Partially allow KVM_SET_CPUID{,2} after KVM_RUN

Commit feb627e8d6f6 ("KVM: x86: Forbid KVM_SET_CPUID{,2} after KVM_RUN")
forbade changing CPUID altogether but unfortunately this is not fully
compatible with existing VMMs. In particular, QEMU reuses vCPU fds for
CPU hotplug after unplug and it calls KVM_SET_CPUID2. Instead of full ban,
check whether the supplied CPUID data is equal to what was previously set.
