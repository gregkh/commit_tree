media: atomisp: drop luma_only, input_yuv and input_raw from ISP2401

This patch removes luma_only, input_yuv and input_raw from
`struct ia_css_binary_info` as well as its usage [1]. Note that for
input_yuv and input_raw, only the definitions were removed because these
were not used anywhere.

[1] added on updating css version to irci_master_20150701_0213
