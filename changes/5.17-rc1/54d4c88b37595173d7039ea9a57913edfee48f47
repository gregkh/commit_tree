mfd: Kconfig: Change INTEL_SOC_PMIC_CHTDC_TI to bool

The INTEL_SOC_PMIC_CHTDC_TI should be initialized early, before
loading the fbcon driver, as otherwise the i915 driver will
fail to configure pwm:

[   13.674287] fb0: switching to inteldrmfb from EFI VGA

[   24.630540] intel_pmic_install_opregion_handler: OpRegion registered

(some extra debug printk's were added to the above)

As suggested by Hans, this patch also addresses an issue with
the dependencies, as, for this driver to be a bool, it also
need the I2C core and the I2C_DESIGNWARE driver to be builtin.
