rcutorture: Combine n_max_cbs from all kthreads in a callback flood

With the addition of multiple callback-flood kthreads, the maximum number
of callbacks from any one of those kthreads is reported in the rcutorture
run summary.  This commit changes this to report the sum of each kthread's
maximum number of callbacks in a given callback-flooding episode.
