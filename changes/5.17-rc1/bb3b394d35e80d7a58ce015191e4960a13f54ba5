KVM: X86: Rename gpte_is_8_bytes to has_4_byte_gpte and invert the direction

This bit is very close to mean "role.quadrant is not in use", except that
it is false also when the MMU is mapping guest physical addresses
directly.  In that case, role.quadrant is indeed not in use, but there
are no guest PTEs at all.

Changing the name and direction of the bit removes the special case,
since a guest with paging disabled, or not considering guest paging
structures as is the case for two-dimensional paging, does not have
to deal with 4-byte guest PTEs.
