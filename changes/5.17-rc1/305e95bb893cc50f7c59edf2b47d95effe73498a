net-ipv6: changes to ->tclass (via IPV6_TCLASS) should sk_dst_reset()

This is to match ipv4 behaviour, see __ip_sock_set_tos()
implementation.

Technically for ipv6 this might not be required because normally we
do not allow tclass to influence routing, yet the cli tooling does
support it:

lpk11:~# ip -6 rule add pref 5 tos 45 lookup 5
lpk11:~# ip -6 rule
5:      from all tos 0x45 lookup 5

and in general dscp/tclass based routing does make sense.

We already have cases where dscp can affect vlan priority and/or
transmit queue (especially on wifi).

So let's just make things match.  Easier to reason about and no harm.
