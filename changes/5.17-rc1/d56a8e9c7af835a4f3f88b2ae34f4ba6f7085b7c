dt-bindings: soc: samsung: Fix I2C clocks order in USI binding example

Now that HSI2C binding [1] is converted to dt-schema format, it reveals
incorrect HSI2C clocks order in USI binding example:

    .../exynos-usi.example.dt.yaml:
    i2c@13820000: clock-names:0: 'hsi2c' was expected
    From schema: .../i2c-exynos5.yaml

    .../exynos-usi.example.dt.yaml:
    i2c@13820000: clock-names:1: 'hsi2c_pclk' was expected
    From schema: .../i2c-exynos5.yaml

Change HSI2C clock order in USI binding example to satisfy HSI2C binding
requirements and fix above warnings.
