dt-bindings: arm: sunxi: Expand MBUS binding

The MBUS provides more than address translation and bandwidth control.
It also provides a PMU to measure bandwidth usage by certain masters,
and it provides notification via IRQ when they are active or idle.

The MBUS is also tightly integrated with the DRAM controller to provide
a Memory Dynamic Frequency Scaling (MDFS) feature. In view of this, the
MBUS binding needs to represent the hardware resources needed for MDFS,
which include the clocks and MMIO range of the adjacent DRAM controller.

Add the additional resources for the H3 and A64 compatibles, and a new
example showing how they are used.
