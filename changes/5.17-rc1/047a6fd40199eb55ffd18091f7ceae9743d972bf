powerpc/config: Add CONFIG_BOOKE_OR_40x

We have many functionnalities common to 40x and BOOKE, it leads to
many places with #if defined(CONFIG_BOOKE) || defined(CONFIG_40x).

We are going to add a few more with KUAP for booke/40x, so create
a new symbol which is defined when either BOOKE or 40x is defined.
