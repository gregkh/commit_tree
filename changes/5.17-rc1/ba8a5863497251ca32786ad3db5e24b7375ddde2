net: alteon: Simplify DMA setting

As stated in [1], dma_set_mask() with a 64-bit mask will never fail if
dev->dma_mask is non-NULL.
So, if it fails, the 32 bits case will also fail for the same reason.

If dma_set_mask_and_coherent() succeeds, 'ap->pci_using_dac' is known to be
1. So 'pci_using_dac' can be removed from the 'struct ace_private'.

Simplify code and remove some dead code accordingly.
