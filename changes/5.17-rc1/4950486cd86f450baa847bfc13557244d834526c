regulator: da9121: Emit only one error message in .remove()

When an i2c remove callback fails, the i2c core emits a generic error
message and still removes the device. Apart from the message there the
return value isn't further used.

So don't return an error code after having already emitted a driver
specific warning about the problem to prevent two messages about the
same issue.
