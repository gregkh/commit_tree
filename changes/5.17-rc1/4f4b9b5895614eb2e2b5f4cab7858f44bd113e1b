tty: serial: atmel: Call dma_async_issue_pending()

The driver wrongly assummed that tx_submit() will start the transfer,
which is not the case, now that the at_xdmac driver is fixed. tx_submit
is supposed to push the current transaction descriptor to a pending queue,
waiting for issue_pending to be called. issue_pending must start the
transfer, not tx_submit.
