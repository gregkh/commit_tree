Revert "drm/i915: Implement Wa_1508744258"

This workarounds are causing hangs, because I missed the fact that it
needs to be enabled for all cases and disabled when doing a resolve
pass.

So KMD only needs to whitelist it and UMD will be the one setting it
on per case.

This reverts commit 28ec02c9cbebf3feeaf21a59df9dfbc02bda3362.
