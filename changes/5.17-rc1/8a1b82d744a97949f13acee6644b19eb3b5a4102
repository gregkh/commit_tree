phy: cadence: Sierra: Add PCIe + QSGMII PHY multilink configuration

Add register sequences for PCIe + QSGMII PHY multilink configuration.
PHY configuration for multi-link operation is done in two steps.
e.g. Consider a case for a 4 lane PHY with PCIe using 2 lanes and QSGMII
other 2 lanes. Sierra PHY has 2 PLLs, viz. PLLLC and PLLLC1. So in this
case, PLLLC is used for PCIe and PLLLC1 is used for QSGMII.

PHY is configured in two steps as described below.

[1] For first step, the register values are selected as
    [TYPE_PCIE][TYPE_QSGMII][ssc].
    This will configure PHY registers associated for PCIe involving PLLLC
    registers and registers for first 2 lanes of PHY.
[2] In second step, the register values are selected as
    [TYPE_QSGMII][TYPE_PCIE][ssc].
    This will configure PHY registers associated for QSGMII involving
    PLLLC1 registers and registers for other 2 lanes of PHY.

This completes the PHY configuration for multilink operation.
