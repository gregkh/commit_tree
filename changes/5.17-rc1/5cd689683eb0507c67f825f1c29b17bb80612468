platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: tpacpi_attr_group contains driver attributes not device attrs

Commit 79f960e29cfc ("platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Convert platform driver
to use dev_groups") put the debug_level, interface_version, version and the
THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUGFACILITIES attributes in a new tpacpi_attr_group and
added those to the tpacpi_groups groups-array which is used to initialize
the driver.dev_groups member.

But before this commit these attributes were registered with
driver_create_file(), so they should be part of the groups-array which is
used to initialize the driver.groups member instead.

And also make the same change for the fan_watchdog hwmon driver attribute.
