mtd: spi-nor: Rework the flash_info flags

Clarify for what the flash_info flags are used for. Split them in
four categories and a bool:
1/ FLAGS: flags that indicate support that is not defined by the JESD216
   standard in its SFDP tables.
2/ NO_SFDP_FLAGS: these flags are used when the flash does not define the
   SFDP tables. These flags indicate support that can be discovered via
   SFDP. Used together with SPI_NOR_SKIP_SFDP flag.
3/ FIXUP_FLAGS: flags that indicate support that can be discovered
   via SFDP ideally, but can not be discovered for this particular flash
   because the SFDP table that indicates this support is not defined by
   the flash. In case the table for this support is defined but has wrong
   values, one should instead use a post_sfdp() hook to set the SNOR_F
   equivalent flag.
4/ MFR_FLAGS: manufacturer private flags. Used in the manufacturer
   fixup hooks to differentiate support between flashes of the same
   manufacturer.
5/ PARSE_SFDP: sets info->parse_sfdp to true. All flash_info entries
   that support SFDP should be converted to set info->parse_sfdp to true.

SPI NOR flashes that statically declare one of the
SPI_NOR_{DUAL, QUAD, OCTAL, OCTAL_DTR}_READ flags and do not support
the RDSFDP command are gratuiously receiving the RDSFDP command
in the attempt of parsing the SFDP tables. It is not desirable to issue
commands that are not supported, so introduce PARSE_SFDP to help on this
situation.

New flash additions/updates should be declared/updated to use either
PARSE_SFDP or SPI_NOR_SKIP_SFDP.  Once all the flash_info entries are
converted to use SPI_NOR_SKIP_SFDP or PARSE_SFDP, we can get rid of the
SPI_NOR_SKIP_SFDP flag and use just the bool nor->info->parse_sfdp to
determine whether to parse SFDP or not. SPI_NOR_SKIP_SFDP flag is kept
just as a way to differentiate whether a flash is converted to the new
flags logic or not.
Support that can be discovered when parsing SFDP should not be duplicated
by explicit flags at flash declaration. All the flash parameters will be
discovered when parsing SFDP. Sometimes manufacturers wrongly define some
fields in the SFDP tables. If that's the case, SFDP data can be amended
with the fixups() hooks. It is not common, but if the SFDP tables are
entirely wrong, and it does not worth the hassle to tweak the SFDP
parameters by using the fixups hooks, or if the flash does not define the
SFDP tables at all, then statically init the flash with the
SPI_NOR_SKIP_SFDP flag and specify the rest of flash capabilities with
the flash info flags.

With time, we want to convert all flashes to use PARSE_SFDP and
stop triggering the SFDP parsing with the
SPI_NOR_{DUAL, QUAD, OCTAL*}_READ flags. Getting rid of the
SPI_NOR_{OCTAL, OCTAL_DTR}_READ trigger is easily achievable,
the rest are a long term goal.

Manufacturer specific flags like USE_CLSR, USE_FSR, SPI_NOR_XSR_RDY,
will be removed in a future series.

No functional changes intended in this patch.
