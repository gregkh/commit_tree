afs: Copy local writes to the cache when writing to the server

When writing to the server from afs_writepage() or afs_writepages(), copy
the data to the cache object too.

To make this possible, the cookie must have its active users count
incremented when the page is dirtied and kept incremented until we manage
to clean up all the pages.  This allows the writeback to take place after
the last file struct is released.
