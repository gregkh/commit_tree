drivers: acpi: acpi_apd: Remove unused device property "is-rv"

Initially "is-rv" device property is added for 48MHz fixed clock
support on Raven or RV architecture. It's unused now as we moved
to pci device_id based selection to extend such support on other
architectures. This change removed unused code from acpi driver.
