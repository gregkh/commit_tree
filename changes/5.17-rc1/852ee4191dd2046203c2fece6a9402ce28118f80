mlxsw: spectrum_acl_bloom_filter: Add support for Spectrum-4 calculation

Spectrum-4 will calculate hash function for bloom filter differently
from the existing ASICs.

First, two hash functions will be used to calculate 16 bits result.
The final result will be combination of the two results - 6 bits which
are result of CRC-6 will be used as MSB and 10 bits which are result of
CRC-10 will be used as LSB.

Second, while in Spectrum{2,3}, there is a padding in each chunk, so the
chunks use a sequence of whole bytes, in Spectrum-4 there is no padding,
so each chunk use 20 bytes minus 2 bits, so it is necessary to align the
chunks to be without holes.

Add dedicated 'mlxsw_sp_acl_bf_ops' for Spectrum-4 and add the required
tables for CRC calculations.

All the details are documented as part of the code for future use.
