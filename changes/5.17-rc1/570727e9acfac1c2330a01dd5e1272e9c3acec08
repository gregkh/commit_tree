clk: imx8mn: Fix imx8mn_clko1_sels

When attempting to use sys_pll1_80m as the parent for clko1, the
system hangs.  This is due to the fact that the source select
for sys_pll1_80m was incorrectly pointing to m7_alt_pll_clk, which
doesn't yet exist.

According to Rev 3 of the TRM, The imx8mn_clko1_sels also incorrectly
references an osc_27m which does not exist, nor does an entry for
source select bits 010b.  Fix both by inserting a dummy clock into
the missing space in the table and renaming the incorrectly name clock
with dummy.
