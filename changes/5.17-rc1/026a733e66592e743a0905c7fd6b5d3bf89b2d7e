crypto: kdf - add SP800-108 counter key derivation function

SP800-108 defines three KDFs - this patch provides the counter KDF
implementation.

The KDF is implemented as a service function where the caller has to
maintain the hash / HMAC state. Apart from this hash/HMAC state, no
additional state is required to be maintained by either the caller or
the KDF implementation.

The key for the KDF is set with the crypto_kdf108_setkey function which
is intended to be invoked before the caller requests a key derivation
operation via crypto_kdf108_ctr_generate.

SP800-108 allows the use of either a HMAC or a hash as crypto primitive
for the KDF. When a HMAC primtive is intended to be used,
crypto_kdf108_setkey must be used to set the HMAC key. Otherwise, for a
hash crypto primitve crypto_kdf108_ctr_generate can be used immediately
after allocating the hash handle.
