clk: stm32: Fix ltdc's clock turn off by clk_disable_unused() after system enter shell

stm32's clk driver register two ltdc gate clk to clk core by
clk_hw_register_gate() and clk_hw_register_composite()

first: 'stm32f429_gates[]', clk name is 'ltdc', which no user to use.
second: 'stm32f429_aux_clk[]', clk name is 'lcd-tft', used by ltdc driver

both of them point to the same offset of stm32's RCC register. after
kernel enter console, clk core turn off ltdc's clk as 'stm32f429_gates[]'
is no one to use. but, actually 'stm32f429_aux_clk[]' is in use.

stm32f469/746/769 have the same issue, fix it.
