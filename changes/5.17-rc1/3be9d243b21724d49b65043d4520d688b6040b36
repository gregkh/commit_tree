PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Set PCI_STATUS_CAP_LIST for PCIe device

Since all PCI Express device Functions are required to implement the PCI
Express Capability structure, Capabilities List bit in PCI Status Register
must be hardwired to 1b. Capabilities Pointer register (which is already
set by pci-bride-emul.c driver) is valid only when Capabilities List is set
to 1b.
