btrfs: get next entry in tree_search_offset before doing checks

This is a small optimisation since the currently 'entry' is already
checked in the if () {} else if {} construct above the loop. In essence
the first iteration of the final while loop is redundant. To eliminate
this extra check simply get the next entry at the beginning of the loop.
