Revert "iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Decrease the queue size of evtq and priq"

The commit f115f3c0d5d8 ("iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Decrease the queue size of
evtq and priq") decreases evtq and priq, which may lead evtq/priq to be
full with fault events, e.g HiSilicon ZIP/SEC/HPRE have maximum 1024 queues
in one device, every queue could be binded with one process and trigger a
fault event. So let's revert f115f3c0d5d8.

In fact, if an implementation of SMMU really does not need so long evtq
and priq, value of IDR1_EVTQS and IDR1_PRIQS can be set to proper ones.
