RDMA/rtrs-srv: Rename rtrs_srv_sess to rtrs_srv_path

rtrs_srv_sess is used for paths and not sessions on the server side. This
creates confusion so let's rename it to rtrs_srv_path. Also, rename
related variables and functions.

Coccinelle is used to do the transformations for most of the occurrences
and remaining ones were handled manually.
