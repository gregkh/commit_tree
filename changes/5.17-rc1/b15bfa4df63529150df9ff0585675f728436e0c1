Bluetooth: mgmt: Fix Experimental Feature Changed event

This patch fixes the controller index in the Experimental Features
Changed event for the offload_codec and the quality_report features to
use the actual hdev index instead of non-controller index(0xffff) so the
client can receive the event and know which controller the event is for.

Fixes: ae7d925b5c043 ("Bluetooth: Support the quality report events")
