ext4: change s_last_trim_minblks type to unsigned long

There is no good reason for the s_last_trim_minblks to be atomic. There is
no data integrity needed and there is no real danger in setting and
reading it in a racy manner. Change it to be unsigned long, the same type
as s_clusters_per_group which is the maximum that's allowed.
