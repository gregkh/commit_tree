ACPI / x86: Allow specifying acpi_device_override_status() quirks by path

Not all ACPI-devices have a HID + UID, allow specifying quirks for
acpi_device_override_status() by path too.

Note this moves the path/HID+UID check to after the CPU + DMI checks
since the path lookup is somewhat costly.

This way this lookup is only done on devices where the other checks
match.
