qed*: esl priv flag support through ethtool

ESL(Enhanced System Lockdown) was designed to lock PCI adapter firmware
images and prevent changes to critical non-volatile configuration data
so that uncontrolled, malicious or unintentional modification to the
adapters are avoided, ensuring it's operational state. Once this feature is
enabled, the device is locked, rejecting any modification to non-volatile
images. Once unlocked, the protection is off such that firmware and
non-volatile configurations may be altered.

Driver just reflects the capability and status of this through
the ethtool private flag.
