ACPI / x86: Add not-present quirk for the PCI0.SDHB.BRC1 device on the GPD win

The GPD win and its sibling the GPD pocket (99% the same electronics in a
different case) use a PCI wifi card. But the ACPI tables on both variants
contain a bug where the SDIO MMC controller for SDIO wifi cards is enabled
despite this. This SDIO MMC controller has a PCI0.SDHB.BRC1 child-device
which _PS3 method sets a GPIO causing the PCI wifi card to turn off.

At the moment there is a pretty ugly kludge in the sdhci-acpi.c code,
just to work around the bug in the DSDT of this single design. This can
be solved cleaner/simply with a quirk overriding the _STA return of the
broken PCI0.SDHB.BRC1 PCI0.SDHB.BRC1 child with a status value of 0,
so that its power_manageable flag gets cleared, avoiding this problem.

Note that even though it is not used, the _STA method for the MMC
controller is deliberately not overridden. If the status of the MMC
controller were forced to 0 it would never get suspended, which would
cause these mini-laptops to not reach S0i3 level when suspended.
