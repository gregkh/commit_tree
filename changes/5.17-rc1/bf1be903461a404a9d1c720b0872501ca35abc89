tools/resolve_btfids: Support cross-building the kernel with clang

The CROSS_COMPILE variable may be present during resolve_btfids build if
the kernel is being cross-built. Since resolve_btfids is always executed
on the host, we set CC to HOSTCC in order to use the host toolchain when
cross-building with GCC. But instead of a toolchain prefix, cross-build
with clang uses a "-target" parameter, which Makefile.include deduces
from the CROSS_COMPILE variable. In order to avoid cross-building
libbpf, clear CROSS_COMPILE before building resolve_btfids.
