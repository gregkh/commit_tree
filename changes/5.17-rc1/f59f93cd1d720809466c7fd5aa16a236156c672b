usb: hub: avoid warm port reset during USB3 disconnect

During disconnect USB-3 ports often go via SS.Inactive link error state
before the missing terminations are noticed, and link finally goes to
RxDetect state

Avoid immediately warm-resetting ports in SS.Inactive state.
Let ports settle for a while and re-read the link status a few times 20ms
apart to see if the ports transitions out of SS.Inactive.

According to USB 3.x spec 7.5.2, a port in SS.Inactive should
automatically check for missing far-end receiver termination every
12 ms (SSInactiveQuietTimeout)

The futile multiple warm reset retries of a disconnected device takes
a lot of time, also the resetting of a removed devices has caused cases
where the reset bit got stuck for a long time on xHCI roothub.
This lead to issues in detecting new devices connected to the same port
shortly after.
