drm/omap: Add ovl checking funcs to dispc_ops

In order to be able to dynamically assign overlays to planes we need to
be able to asses the overlay capabilities.

Add a helper function to be able to retrieve the supported capabilities
of an overlay.

And export the function to check if a fourcc is supported on a given
overlay.
