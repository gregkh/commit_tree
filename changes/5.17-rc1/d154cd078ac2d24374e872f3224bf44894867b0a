mctp: serial: enforce fixed MTU

The current serial driver requires a maximum MTU of 68, and it doesn't
make sense to set a MTU below the MCTP-required baseline (of 68) either.

This change sets the min_mtu & max_mtu of the mctp netdev, essentially
disallowing changes. By using these instead of a ndo_change_mtu op, we
get the netlink extacks reported too.
