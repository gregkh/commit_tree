btrfs: selftests: dump extent io tree if extent-io-tree test failed

When code modifying extent-io-tree get modified and got that selftest
failed, it can take some time to pin down the cause.

To make it easier to expose the problem, dump the extent io tree if the
selftest failed.

This can save developers debug time, especially since the selftest we
can not use the trace events, thus have to manually add debug trace
points.
