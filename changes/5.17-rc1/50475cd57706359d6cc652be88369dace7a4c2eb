btrfs: add extent allocator hook to decide to allocate chunk or not

Introduce a new hook for an extent allocator policy. With the new
hook, a policy can decide to allocate a new block group or not. If
not, it will return -ENOSPC, so btrfs_reserve_extent() will cut the
allocation size in half and retry the allocation if min_alloc_size is
large enough.

The hook has a place holder and will be replaced with the real
implementation in the next patch.
