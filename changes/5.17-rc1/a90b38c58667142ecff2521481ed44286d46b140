platform/x86: wmi: Replace read_takes_no_args with a flags field

Replace the wmi_block.read_takes_no_args bool field with
an unsigned long flags field, used together with test_bit()
and friends.

This is a preparation patch for fixing a driver->notify() vs ->probe()
race, which requires atomic flag handling.
