usb: gadget: configfs: simplify os_desc_item_to_gadget_info() helper

since os_desc_group is already a member of struct gadget_info,
we can simply just use container_of() to retrieve the latter,
without needing to dereference the cg_item's parent pointer.

use os_desc_item_to_gadget_info() helper in os_desc (un)link function.
