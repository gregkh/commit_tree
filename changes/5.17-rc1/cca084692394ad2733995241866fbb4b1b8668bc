drm/i915: Use per device iommu check

With both integrated and discrete Intel GPUs in a system, the current
global check of intel_iommu_gfx_mapped, as done from intel_vtd_active()
may not be completely accurate.

In this patch we add i915 parameter to intel_vtd_active() in order to
prepare it for multiple GPUs and we also change the check away from Intel
specific intel_iommu_gfx_mapped (global exported by the Intel IOMMU
driver) to probing the presence of IOMMU on a specific device using
device_iommu_mapped().

This will return true both for IOMMU pass-through and address translation
modes which matches the current behaviour. If in the future we wanted to
distinguish between these two modes we could either use
iommu_get_domain_for_dev() and check for __IOMMU_DOMAIN_PAGING bit
indicating address translation, or ask for a new API to be exported from
the IOMMU core code.

v2:
  * Check for dmar translation specifically, not just iommu domain. (Baolu)

v3:
 * Go back to plain "any domain" check for now, rewrite commit message.

v4:
 * Use device_iommu_mapped. (Robin, Baolu)
