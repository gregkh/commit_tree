random: selectively clang-format where it makes sense

This is an old driver that has seen a lot of different eras of kernel
coding style. In an effort to make it easier to code for, unify the
coding style around the current norm, by accepting some of -- but
certainly not all of -- the suggestions from clang-format. This should
remove ambiguity in coding style, especially with regards to spacing,
when code is being changed or amended. Consequently it also makes code
review easier on the eyes, following one uniform style rather than
several.
