filemap: Add filemap_remove_folio and __filemap_remove_folio

Reimplement __delete_from_page_cache() as a wrapper around
__filemap_remove_folio() and delete_from_page_cache() as a wrapper
around filemap_remove_folio().  Remove the EXPORT_SYMBOL as
delete_from_page_cache() was not used by any in-tree modules.
Convert page_cache_free_page() into filemap_free_folio().
