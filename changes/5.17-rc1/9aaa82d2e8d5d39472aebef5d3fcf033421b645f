bna: Simplify DMA setting

As stated in [1], dma_set_mask() with a 64-bit mask will never fail if
dev->dma_mask is non-NULL.
So, if it fails, the 32 bits case will also fail for the same reason.

So, if dma_set_mask_and_coherent() succeeds, 'using_dac' is known to be
'true'. This variable can be removed.

Simplify code and remove some dead code accordingly.
