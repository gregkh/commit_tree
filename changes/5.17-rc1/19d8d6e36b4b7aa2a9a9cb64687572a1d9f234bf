platform/x86: int3472: Pass tps68470_regulator_platform_data to the tps68470-regulator MFD-cell

Pass tps68470_regulator_platform_data to the tps68470-regulator
MFD-cell, specifying the voltages of the various regulators and
tying the regulators to the sensor supplies so that sensors which use
the TPS68470 can find their regulators.

Since the voltages and supply connections are board-specific, this
introduces a DMI matches int3472_tps68470_board_data struct which
contains the necessary per-board info.

This per-board info also includes GPIO lookup information for the
sensor IO lines which may be connected to the tps68470 GPIOs.
