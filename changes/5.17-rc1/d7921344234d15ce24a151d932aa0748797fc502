security: DH - remove dead code for zero padding

Remove the specific code that adds a zero padding that was intended
to be invoked when the DH operation result was smaller than the
modulus. However, this cannot occur any more these days because the
function mpi_write_to_sgl is used in the code path that calculates the
shared secret in dh_compute_value. This MPI service function guarantees
that leading zeros are introduced as needed to ensure the resulting data
is exactly as long as the modulus. This implies that the specific code
to add zero padding is dead code which can be safely removed.
