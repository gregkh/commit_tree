ntb_hw_switchtec: Fix bug with more than 32 partitions

Switchtec could support as mush as 48 partitions, but ffs & fls are
for 32 bit argument, in case of partition index larger than 31, the
current code could not parse the peer partition index correctly.
Change to the 64 bit version __ffs64 & fls64 accordingly to fix this
bug.
