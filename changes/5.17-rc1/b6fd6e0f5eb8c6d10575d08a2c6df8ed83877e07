drm/amdgpu: Check the memory can be accesssed by ttm_device_clear_dma_mappings.

If the event guard is enabled and VF doesn't receive an ack from PF for full access,
the guest driver load crashes.
This is caused due to the call to ttm_device_clear_dma_mappings with non-initialized
mman during driver tear down.

This patch adds the necessary condition to check if the mman initialization passed or not
and takes the path based on the condition output.
