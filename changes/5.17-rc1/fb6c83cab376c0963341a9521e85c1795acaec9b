ASoC: AMD: fix depend/select mistake on SND_AMD_ACP_CONFIG

on i386 or x86_64:

when # CONFIG_ACPI is not set,
so SND_SOC_ACPI is not set:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SND_AMD_ACP_CONFIG
  Depends on [n]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] &&
  SND_SOC_ACPI [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - SND_SOC_AMD_ACP_COMMON [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] &&
  SND_SOC [=y] && X86 [=y] && PCI [=y]

This problem is due to the unconditional selection of
SND_AMD_ACP_CONFIG in other options. Using 'depends on' solved an
initial problem but exposed another, let's use select instead.
