gpio: pch: Use .driver_data instead of checking Device IDs again

Previously, pch_gpio_probe() tested the Device ID to determine the type of
IOH.  But the driver core has already matched the Device ID with one of the
IDs in the pch_gpio_pcidev_id[] table, and we can supply the IOH type there
as .driver_data.

Use the pci_device_id.driver_data to learn the IOH type instead of testing
the Device ID again.

No functional change intended.
