ipv4/raw: support binding to nonlocal addresses

Add support to inet v4 raw sockets for binding to nonlocal addresses
through the IP_FREEBIND and IP_TRANSPARENT socket options, as well as
the ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind kernel parameter.

Add helper function to inet_sock.h to check for bind address validity on
the base of the address type and whether nonlocal address are enabled
for the socket via any of the sockopts/sysctl, deduplicating checks in
ipv4/ping.c, ipv4/af_inet.c, ipv6/af_inet6.c (for mapped v4->v6
addresses), and ipv4/raw.c.

Add test cases with IP[V6]_FREEBIND verifying that both v4 and v6 raw
sockets support binding to nonlocal addresses after the change. Add
necessary support for the test cases to nettest.
