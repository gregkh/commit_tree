media: i2c: hi846: use pm_runtime_force_suspend/resume for system suspend

In cases like this when controlling regulators and clocks the suspend()
and resume() functions are meant to be called balanced toggling the behaviour.

It's wrong to use the same suspend function for runtime and system suspend
in this case and leads to errors like

[   77.718890] Failed to disable vddd: -EIO

Use pm_runtime_force_* helpers in order to support system suspend properly
when runtime pm is already implemented and fix this.
