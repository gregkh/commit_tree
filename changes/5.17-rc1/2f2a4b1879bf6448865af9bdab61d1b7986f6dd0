drm/amd/display: Skip vendor specific LTTPR w/a outside link training

[Why]
Vendor specific link rate toggle workaround should not be
applied outside of link training scenario, such as when
outputting PHY test pattern.

[How]
Add flag to indicate when link training is occuring.
Make workaround a no-op when flag is not set.
