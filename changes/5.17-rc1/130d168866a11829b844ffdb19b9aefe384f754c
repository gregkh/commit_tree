hwmon: prefix kernel-doc comments for structs with struct

The command ./scripts/kernel-doc -none include/linux/hwmon.h warns:

  include/linux/hwmon.h:406: warning: This comment starts with '/**', but
    isn't a kernel-doc comment. Refer Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-doc.rst
   * Channel information
  include/linux/hwmon.h:425: warning: This comment starts with '/**', but
    isn't a kernel-doc comment. Refer Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-doc.rst
   * Chip configuration

Address those kernel-doc warnings by prefixing kernel-doc descriptions for
structs with the keyword 'struct'.
