mmc: omap_hsmmc: Revert special init for wl1251

Due to recent changes to the mmc core, card quirks can be applied based
upon a compatible string in child OF node. The quirk needed for wl1251
(SDIO card) is managed in the core, therefore there is no longer any reason
to deal with this in omap_hsmmc too, so let's remove it.
