cfg80211: Use the HE operation IE to determine a 6GHz BSS channel

A non-collocated AP whose primary channel is not a PSC channel
may transmit a duplicated beacon on the corresponding PSC channel
in which it would indicate its true primary channel.
Use this inforamtion contained in the HE operation IE to determine
the primary channel of the AP.
In case of invalid infomration ignore it and use the channel
the frame was received on.
