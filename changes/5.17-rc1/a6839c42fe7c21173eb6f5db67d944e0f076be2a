ARM: dts: qcom: Build apq8016-sbc/DragonBoard 410c DTB on ARM32

The DragonBoard 410c is a convenient device for testing and debugging.
Since there is support for using ARM32 kernels on MSM8916 now, also
build the DB410c DTB on ARM32 so it can be used for testing. ARM64
is still the main supported architecture for DB410c but it actually
works great on ARM32 as well.

The "apq8016-sbc.dts" is simply included as-is from ARM64 similar
to the approach used for Raspberry Pi (e.g. bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts).
