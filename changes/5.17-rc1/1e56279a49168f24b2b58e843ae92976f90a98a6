x86/mce/inject: Set the valid bit in MCA_STATUS before error injection

MCA handlers check the valid bit in each status register
(MCA_STATUS[Val]) and continue processing the error only if the valid
bit is set.

Set the valid bit unconditionally in the corresponding MCA_STATUS
register and correct any Val=0 injections made by the user as such
errors will get ignored and such injections will be largely pointless.
