PM: runtime: Add DEFINE_RUNTIME_DEV_PM_OPS() macro

A lot of drivers create a dev_pm_ops struct with the system sleep
suspend/resume callbacks set to pm_runtime_force_suspend() and
pm_runtime_force_resume().

These drivers can now use the DEFINE_RUNTIME_DEV_PM_OPS() macro, which
will use pm_runtime_force_{suspend,resume}() as the system sleep
callbacks, while having the same dead code removal characteristic that
is already provided by DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS().
