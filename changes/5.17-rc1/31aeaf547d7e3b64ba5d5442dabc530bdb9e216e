ath11k: fix DMA memory free in CE pipe cleanup

In CE pipe cleanup, DMA memory gets freed by the aligned address
(base_addr_owner_space) which is wrong. It needs to be freed
by the address (base_addr_owner_space_unaligned) returned by
dma_alloc. So free the dma memory by the proper address.
This was found in code review.
