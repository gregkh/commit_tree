iwlwifi: recognize missing PNVM data and then log filename

We can detect that a FW SYSASSERT is due to missing PNVM data by
checking the assertion code.  When this happens, it's is useful for
the user if we print the filename where the driver is looking for the
data.

Add the PNVM missing assertion code to the dump list and print out the
name of the file we're looking for when this happens.
