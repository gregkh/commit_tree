KVM: Rename kvm_vcpu_block() => kvm_vcpu_halt()

Rename kvm_vcpu_block() to kvm_vcpu_halt() in preparation for splitting
the actual "block" sequences into a separate helper (to be named
kvm_vcpu_block()).  x86 will use the standalone block-only path to handle
non-halt cases where the vCPU is not runnable.

Rename block_ns to halt_ns to match the new function name.

No functional change intended.
