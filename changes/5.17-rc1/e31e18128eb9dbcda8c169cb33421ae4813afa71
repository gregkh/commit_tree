scsi: libsas: Insert PORTE_BROADCAST_RCVD event for resuming host

If a new disk is inserted through an expander when the host was suspended,
it will not necessarily be detected as the topology is not re-scanned
during resume.  To detect possible changes in topology during suspension,
insert a PORTE_BROADCAST_RCVD event per port when resuming to trigger a
revalidation.
