PCI: Let pcibios_root_bridge_prepare() access bridge->windows

When pci_register_host_bridge() is called, bridge->windows are already
available. However these windows are being moved temporarily from there.

To let pcibios_root_bridge_prepare() have access to these windows, move the
windows movement after calling this function. This is useful for the MIPS
ralink mt7621 platform so it can set up I/O coherence units and avoid
custom MIPS code in the mt7621 PCIe controller driver.
