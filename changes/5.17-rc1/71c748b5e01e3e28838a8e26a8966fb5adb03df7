ath11k: Fix unexpected return buffer manager error for QCA6390

We are seeing below error on QCA6390:
...
[70211.671189] ath11k_pci 0000:72:00.0: failed to parse rx error in wbm_rel ring desc -22
[70212.696154] ath11k_pci 0000:72:00.0: failed to parse rx error in wbm_rel ring desc -22
[70213.092941] ath11k_pci 0000:72:00.0: failed to parse rx error in wbm_rel ring desc -22
...

The reason is that, with commit 734223d78428 ("ath11k: change return
buffer manager for QCA6390"), ath11k expects the return buffer manager
(RBM) field of descriptor configured as HAL_RX_BUF_RBM_SW1_BM when
parsing error frames from WBM2SW3_RELEASE ring. This is a wrong change
cause the RBM field is set as HAL_RX_BUF_RBM_SW3_BM.

The same issue also applies to REO2TCL ring though we have not got any
error reported.

Fix it by changing RBM from HAL_RX_BUF_RBM_SW1_BM to HAL_RX_BUF_RBM_SW3_BM
for these two rings.
