rtc: da9063: add as wakeup source

As da9063 RTC is not a real I2C client, but relies on da9063 MFD
driver, we need to explicitly mark da9063 RTC as a wakeup source
to be able to access class/rtc/rtcN/wakealarm sysfs entry
to set alarms, so we can wakeup from SHUTDOWN/RTC/DELIVERY mode.

As da9063 driver refuses to load without irq, we simply add it
as a wakeup source before registering rtc device.
