net: remove .ndo_change_proto_down

.ndo_change_proto_down was added seemingly to enable out-of-tree
implementations. Over 2.5yrs later we still have no real users
upstream. Hardwire the generic implementation for now, we can
revert once real users materialize. (rocker is a test vehicle,
not a user.)

We need to drop the optimization on the sysfs side, because
unlike ndos priv_flags will be changed at runtime, so we'd
need READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE everywhere..
