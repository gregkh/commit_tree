mm: compaction: fix the migration stats in trace_mm_compaction_migratepages()

Now the migrate_pages() has changed to return the number of {normal
page, THP, hugetlb} instead, thus we should not use the return value to
calculate the number of pages migrated successfully.  Instead we can
just use the 'nr_succeeded' which indicates the number of normal pages
migrated successfully to calculate the non-migrated pages in
trace_mm_compaction_migratepages().
