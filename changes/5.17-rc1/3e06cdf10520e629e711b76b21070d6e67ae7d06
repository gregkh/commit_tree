KVM: selftests: Add initial support for RISC-V 64-bit

We add initial support for RISC-V 64-bit in KVM selftests using
which we can cross-compile and run arch independent tests such as:
demand_paging_test
dirty_log_test
kvm_create_max_vcpus,
kvm_page_table_test
set_memory_region_test
kvm_binary_stats_test

All VM guest modes defined in kvm_util.h require at least 48-bit
guest virtual address so to use KVM RISC-V selftests hardware
need to support at least Sv48 MMU for guest (i.e. VS-mode).
