libbpf: Deprecate bpf_prog_load_xattr() API

bpf_prog_load_xattr() is high-level API that's named as a low-level
BPF_PROG_LOAD wrapper APIs, but it actually operates on struct
bpf_object. It's badly and confusingly misnamed as it will load all the
progs insige bpf_object, returning prog_fd of the very first BPF
program. It also has a bunch of ad-hoc things like log_level override,
map_ifindex auto-setting, etc. All this can be expressed more explicitly
and cleanly through existing libbpf APIs. This patch marks
bpf_prog_load_xattr() for deprecation in libbpf v0.8 ([0]).
