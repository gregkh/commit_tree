thermal/drivers/imx8mm: Enable ADC when enabling monitor

The i.MX 8MP has a ADC_PD bit in the TMU_TER register that controls the
operating mode of the ADC:
* 0 means normal operating mode
* 1 means power down mode

When enabling/disabling the TMU, the ADC operating mode must be set
accordingly.

i.MX 8M Mini & Nano are lacking this bit.
