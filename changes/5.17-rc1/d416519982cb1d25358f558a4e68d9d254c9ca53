ASoC: SOF: hda: don't use the core op for power up/power down

The core_power_up/down() ops will be deprecated. Use the
HDA platform-specific functions for powering up/down
the cores during probe/suspend/remove. The enabled_cores_mask
and the core ref_count's are manually updated in each of
these functions.
