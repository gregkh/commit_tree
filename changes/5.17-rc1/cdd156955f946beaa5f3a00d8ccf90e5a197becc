drm/etnaviv: consider completed fence seqno in hang check

Some GPU heavy test programs manage to trigger the hangcheck quite often.
If there are no other GPU users in the system and the test program
exhibits a very regular structure in the commandstreams that are being
submitted, we can end up with two distinct submits managing to trigger
the hangcheck with the FE in a very similar address range. This leads
the hangcheck to believe that the GPU is stuck, while in reality the GPU
is already busy working on a different job. To avoid those spurious
GPU resets, also remember and consider the last completed fence seqno
in the hang check.
