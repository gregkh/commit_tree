cxgb3: Use struct_group() for memcpy() region

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally writing across neighboring fields.

Use struct_group() in struct rss_hdr around members imm_data and intr_gen,
so they can be referenced together. This will allow memcpy() and sizeof()
to more easily reason about sizes, improve readability, and avoid future
warnings about writing beyond the end of imm_data.

"pahole" shows no size nor member offset changes to struct rss_hdr.
"objdump -d" shows no object code changes.
