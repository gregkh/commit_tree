mtd: rawnand: gpmi: Add ERR007117 protection for nfc_apply_timings

gpmi_io clock needs to be gated off when changing the parent/dividers of
enfc_clk_root (i.MX6Q/i.MX6UL) respectively qspi2_clk_root (i.MX6SX).
Otherwise this rate change can lead to an unresponsive GPMI core which
results in DMA timeouts and failed driver probe:

[    4.072318] gpmi-nand 112000.gpmi-nand: DMA timeout, last DMA
...
[    4.370355] gpmi-nand 112000.gpmi-nand: Chip: 0, Error -110
...
[    4.375988] gpmi-nand 112000.gpmi-nand: Chip: 0, Error -22
[    4.381524] gpmi-nand 112000.gpmi-nand: Error in ECC-based read: -22
[    4.387988] gpmi-nand 112000.gpmi-nand: Chip: 0, Error -22
[    4.393535] gpmi-nand 112000.gpmi-nand: Chip: 0, Error -22
...

Other than stated in i.MX 6 erratum ERR007117, it should be sufficient
to gate only gpmi_io because all other bch/nand clocks are derived from
different clock roots.

The i.MX6 reference manuals state that changing clock muxers can cause
glitches but are silent about changing dividers. But tests showed that
these glitches can definitely happen on i.MX6ULL. For i.MX7D/8MM in turn,
the manual guarantees that no glitches can happen when changing
dividers.
