net: hns3: refactor VF rss get APIs with new common rss get APIs

This patch firstly uses new rss parameter struct(hclge_comm_rss_cfg) as
child member of hclgevf_dev and deletes the original child rss parameter
member(hclgevf_rss_cfg). All the rss parameter members used in VF rss
module is modified according to the new hclge_comm_rss_cfg.

Secondly VF rss get APIs are refactored to use new common rss get APIs. The
old rss get APIs in VF are deleted.
