drm/vmwgfx: Add a debug callback to mobid resource manager

Mob/GMR id resource manager was lacking the debug print callback
which meant that during memory errors we weren't getting the details
which are needed to fix those errors.

Kernel logs need to contain the information about used/max pages
by the Mob/GMR id resource manager as well as the maximum number
of id's they're allowed to allocate.
