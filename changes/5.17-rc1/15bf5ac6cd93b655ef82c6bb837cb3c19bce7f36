iwlwifi: pcie: retake ownership after reset

In most cases, unless shutting down the NIC, we really need
to retake ownership after doing a software reset of the NIC.
Encode that into the API so we "automatically" do it, even
in case of workarounds, and don't keep forgetting it like a
few of the places we have did.
