mm, oom: OOM sysrq should always kill a process

The OOM kill sysrq (alt+sysrq+F) should allow the user to kill the
process with the highest OOM badness with a single execution.

However, at the moment, the OOM kill can bail out if an OOM notifier
(e.g.  the i915 one) says that it reclaimed a tiny amount of memory from
somewhere.  That's probably not what the user wants, so skip the bailout
if the OOM was triggered via sysrq.
