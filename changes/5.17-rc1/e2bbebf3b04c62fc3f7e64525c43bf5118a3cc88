arm64: dts: qcom: apq8096-db820c: specify adsp firmware name

Specify firmware name to be used for the ADSP. Quoting Bjorn from the
respective apq8016-sbc commit:

The firmware for the modem and WiFi subsystems platform specific and is
signed with a OEM specific key (or a test key). In order to support more
than a single device it is therefor not possible to rely on the default
path and stash these files directly in the firmware directory.
