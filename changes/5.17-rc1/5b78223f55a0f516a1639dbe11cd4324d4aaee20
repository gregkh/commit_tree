mfd: intel_soc_pmic: Use CPU-id check instead of _HRV check to differentiate variants

The Intel Crystal Cove PMIC has 2 different variants, one for use with
Bay Trail (BYT) SoCs and one for use with Cherry Trail (CHT) SoCs.

So far we have been using an ACPI _HRV check to differentiate between
the 2, but at least on the Microsoft Surface 3, which is a CHT device,
the wrong _HRV value is reported by ACPI.

So instead switch to a CPU-ID check which prevents us from relying on
the possibly wrong ACPI _HRV value.
