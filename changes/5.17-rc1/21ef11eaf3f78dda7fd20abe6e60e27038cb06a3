myri10ge: Simplify DMA setting

As stated in [1], dma_set_mask() with a 64-bit mask will never fail if
dev->dma_mask is non-NULL.
So, if it fails, the 32 bits case will also fail for the same reason.

If dma_set_mask_and_coherent() succeeds, 'dac_enabled' is known to be 1.

Simplify code and remove some dead code accordingly.
