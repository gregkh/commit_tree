firmware: qemu_fw_cfg: fix kobject leak in probe error path

An initialised kobject must be freed using kobject_put() to avoid
leaking associated resources (e.g. the object name).

Commit fe3c60684377 ("firmware: Fix a reference count leak.") "fixed"
the leak in the first error path of the file registration helper but
left the second one unchanged. This "fix" would however result in a NULL
pointer dereference due to the release function also removing the never
added entry from the fw_cfg_entry_cache list. This has now been
addressed.

Fix the remaining kobject leak by restoring the common error path and
adding the missing kobject_put().
