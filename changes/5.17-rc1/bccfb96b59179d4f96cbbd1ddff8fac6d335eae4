dmaengine: at_xdmac: Don't start transactions at tx_submit level

tx_submit is supposed to push the current transaction descriptor to a
pending queue, waiting for issue_pending() to be called. issue_pending()
must start the transfer, not tx_submit(), thus remove
at_xdmac_start_xfer() from at_xdmac_tx_submit(). Clients of at_xdmac that
assume that tx_submit() starts the transfer must be updated and call
dma_async_issue_pending() if they miss to call it (one example is
atmel_serial).

As the at_xdmac_start_xfer() is now called only from
at_xdmac_advance_work() when !at_xdmac_chan_is_enabled(), the
at_xdmac_chan_is_enabled() check is no longer needed in
at_xdmac_start_xfer(), thus remove it.
