x86/mce: Remove noinstr annotation from mce_setup()

Instead, sandwitch around the call which is done in noinstr context and
mark the caller - mce_gather_info() - as noinstr.

Also, document what the whole instrumentation strategy with #MC is going
to be in the future and where it all is supposed to be going to.
