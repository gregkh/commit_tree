RISC-V: Do not use cpumask data structure for hartid bitmap

Currently, SBI APIs accept a hartmask that is generated from struct
cpumask. Cpumask data structure can hold upto NR_CPUs value. Thus, it
is not the correct data structure for hartids as it can be higher
than NR_CPUs for platforms with sparse or discontguous hartids.

Remove all association between hartid mask and struct cpumask.
