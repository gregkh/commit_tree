soc/tegra: Enable runtime PM during OPP state-syncing

GENPD core now can set up domain's performance state properly while device
is RPM-suspended. Runtime PM of a device must be enabled during setup
because GENPD checks whether device is suspended and check doesn't work
while RPM is disabled. Instead of replicating the boilerplate RPM-enable
code around OPP helper for each driver, let's make OPP helper to take care
of enabling it.
