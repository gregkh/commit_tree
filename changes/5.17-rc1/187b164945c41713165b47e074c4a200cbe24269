mmc: core: transplant ti,wl1251 quirks from to be retired omap_hsmmc

The TiWi WL1251 WiFi chip needs special setup of the sdio
interface before it can be probed.

So far, this is done in omap_hsmmc_init_card() in omap_hsmmc.c
which makes it useable only if connected to omap devices
which use the omap_hsmmc. The OpenPandora is the most promient
example.

There are plans to switch to a newer sdhci-omap driver and
retire omap_hsmmc. Hence this quirk must be reworked or moved
somewhere else. Ideally to some location that is not dependent
on the specific SoC mmc host driver.

This is achieved by the new mmc_fixup_device() option introduced
by ("mmc: allow to match the device tree to apply quirks") to match
through device tree compatible string.

This quirk will be called early right after where host->ops->init_card()
and thus omap_hsmmc_init_card() was previously called.

Note that we do not need to transplant

	card->ocr = 0x80;

because we rely on ("mmc: core: Fixup storing of OCR for MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO").
