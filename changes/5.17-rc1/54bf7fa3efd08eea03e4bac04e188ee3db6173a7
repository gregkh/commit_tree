ima: Fix undefined arch_ima_get_secureboot() and co

Currently arch_ima_get_secureboot() and arch_get_ima_policy() are
defined only when CONFIG_IMA is set, and this makes any code calling
those functions without CONFIG_IMA fail.

Move the declaration and the dummy definition of those functions
outside ifdef-CONFIG_IMA block for fixing the undefined symbols.
