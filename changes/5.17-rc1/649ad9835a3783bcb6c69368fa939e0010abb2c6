iommu/iova: Squash flush_cb abstraction

Once again, with iommu-dma now being the only flush queue user, we no
longer need the extra level of indirection through flush_cb. Squash that
and let the flush queue code call the domain method directly. This does
mean temporarily having to carry an additional copy of the IOMMU domain
pointer around instead, but only until a later patch untangles it again.
