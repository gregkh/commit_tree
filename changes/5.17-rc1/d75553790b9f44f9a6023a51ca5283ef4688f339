hwmon: (adm1031) Remove redundant assignment to variable range

Variable range is being initialized with a value that is never read, it
is being re-assigned in the next statement. The assignment is redundant,
remove it and initialize range using the second assigned value. Clean up
the formatting too by adding missing spaces.
