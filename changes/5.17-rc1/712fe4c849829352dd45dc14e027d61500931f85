serial: sh-sci: Remove BREAK/FRAME/PARITY/OVERRUN printouts

Update the SCIF serial driver to remove printouts for break, frame, parity
and overrun errors. This reduces the amount of console printouts generated
by the defconfig kernel on R-Car Gen3 for certain use cases. To retrieve
more information about such errors the user may inspect counters. Also these
errors are fed into the TTY layer for further application specific handling.
