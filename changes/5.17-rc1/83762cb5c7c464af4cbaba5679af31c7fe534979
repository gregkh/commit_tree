dax: Kill DEV_DAX_PMEM_COMPAT

The /sys/class/dax compatibility option has shipped in the kernel for 4
years now which should be sufficient time for tools to abandon the old
ABI in favor of the /sys/bus/dax device-model. Delete it now and see if
anyone screams.

Since this compatibility option shipped there has been more reports of
users being surprised by the compat ABI than surprised by the "new", so
the compat infrastructure has outlived its usefulness. Recall that
/sys/bus/dax device-model is required for the dax kmem driver which
allows PMEM to be used as "System RAM".

The following projects were known to have a dependency on /sys/class/dax
and have dropped their dependency as of the listed version:

- ndctl (including libndctl, daxctl, and libdaxctl): v64+
- fio: v3.13+
- pmdk: v1.5.2+

As further evidence this option is no longer needed some distributions
have already stopped enabling CONFIG_DEV_DAX_PMEM_COMPAT.
