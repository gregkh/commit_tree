KVM: selftests: Add a test to force emulation with a pending exception

Add a VMX specific test to verify that KVM doesn't explode if userspace
attempts KVM_RUN when emulation is required with a pending exception.
KVM VMX's emulation support for !unrestricted_guest punts exceptions to
userspace instead of attempting to synthesize the exception with all the
correct state (and stack switching, etc...).

Punting is acceptable as there's never been a request to support
injecting exceptions when emulating due to invalid state, but KVM has
historically assumed that userspace will do the right thing and either
clear the exception or kill the guest.  Deliberately do the opposite and
attempt to re-enter the guest with a pending exception and emulation
required to verify KVM continues to punt the combination to userspace,
e.g. doesn't explode, WARN, etc...
