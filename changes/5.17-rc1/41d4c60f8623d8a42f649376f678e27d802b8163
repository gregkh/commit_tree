ata: libata-scsi: rework ata_dump_status to avoid using pr_cont()

pr_cont() has the problem that individual calls will be disrupted
under high load, causing each call to end up on a single line and
thereby mangling the output.
So rework ata_dump_status() to have just one call to ata_port_warn()
and avoid this problem.
