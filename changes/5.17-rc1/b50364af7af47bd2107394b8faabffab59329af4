drm/i915/fbc: Extract snb_fbc_program_fence()

We have two identical copies of the snb+ system agent
CPU fence programming code. Extract into a helper.

Also there's no real point in insisting that we
program 0 into DPFC_CPU_FENCE_OFFSET when the fence is
disabled. So just always stick the computed Y offset there
whether or not the fence is actually used or not.
