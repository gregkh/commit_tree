media: aspeed: Update signal status immediately to ensure sane hw state

If res-chg, VE_INTERRUPT_MODE_DETECT_WD irq will be raised. But
v4l2_input_status won't be updated to no-signal immediately until
aspeed_video_get_resolution() in aspeed_video_resolution_work().

During the period of time, aspeed_video_start_frame() could be called
because it doesn't know signal becomes unstable now. If it goes with
aspeed_video_init_regs() of aspeed_video_irq_res_change()
simultaneously, it will mess up hw state.

To fix this problem, v4l2_input_status is updated to no-signal
immediately for VE_INTERRUPT_MODE_DETECT_WD irq.
