xfrm: fix dflt policy check when there is no policy configured

When there is no policy configured on the system, the default policy is
checked in xfrm_route_forward. However, it was done with the wrong
direction (XFRM_POLICY_FWD instead of XFRM_POLICY_OUT).
The default policy for XFRM_POLICY_FWD was checked just before, with a call
to xfrm[46]_policy_check().
