dt-bindings: xen: Clarify "reg" purpose

Xen on Arm has gained new support recently to calculate and report
extended regions (unused address space) safe to use for external
mappings. These regions are reported via "reg" property under
"hypervisor" node in the guest device-tree. As region 0 is reserved
for grant table space (always present), the indexes for extended
regions are 1...N.

No device-tree bindings update is needed (except clarifying the text)
as guest infers the presence of extended regions from the number
of regions in "reg" property.

While at it, remove the following sentence:
"This property is unnecessary when booting Dom0 using ACPI."
for "reg" and "interrupts" properties as the initialization is not
done via device-tree "hypervisor" node in that case anyway.
