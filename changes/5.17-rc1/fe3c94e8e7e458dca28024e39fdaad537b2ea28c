ARM: tegra: Remove unsupported properties on Apalis

The +V1.2_VDD_CORE regulator on Apalis and Colibri boards uses the
unsupported ti,vsel{0,1}-state-low properties. It turns out that these
are in fact the default and can be overridden by ti,vsel{0,1}-state-high
properties if needed. Drop them since they are not needed.
