drm/panel: innolux-p079zca: Delete panel on attach() failure

If we fail to attach (e.g., because 1 of 2 dual-DSI controllers aren't
ready), we leave a dangling drm_panel reference to freed memory. Clean
that up on failure.

This problem exists since the driver's introduction, but is especially
relevant after refactored for dual-DSI variants.
