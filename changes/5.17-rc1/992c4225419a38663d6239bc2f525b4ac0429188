libbpf: Unify low-level map creation APIs w/ new bpf_map_create()

Mark the entire zoo of low-level map creation APIs for deprecation in
libbpf 0.7 ([0]) and introduce a new bpf_map_create() API that is
OPTS-based (and thus future-proof) and matches the BPF_MAP_CREATE
command name.

While at it, ensure that gen_loader sends map_extra field. Also remove
now unneeded btf_key_type_id/btf_value_type_id logic that libbpf is
doing anyways.
