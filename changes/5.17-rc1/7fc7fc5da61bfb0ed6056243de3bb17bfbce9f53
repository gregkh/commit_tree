cxgb4: Remove useless DMA-32 fallback configuration

As stated in [1], dma_set_mask() with a 64-bit mask never fails if
dev->dma_mask is non-NULL.
So, if it fails, the 32 bits case will also fail for the same reason.

So, if dma_set_mask_and_coherent() succeeds, 'highdma' is known to be true.

Simplify code and remove some dead code accordingly.
