can: rcar_canfd: rcar_canfd_channel_probe(): make sure we free CAN network device

Make sure we free CAN network device in the error path. There are
several jumps to fail label after allocating the CAN network device
successfully. This patch places the free_candev() under fail label so
that in failure path a jump to fail label frees the CAN network
device.
