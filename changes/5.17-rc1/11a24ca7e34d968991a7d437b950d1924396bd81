hwmon: (ntc_thermistor) Merge platform data into driver

Platform data is supposed to be used with "board files",
device descriptions in C. Since the introduction of the
NTC driver in 2011, no such platforms have been submitted
to the Linux kernel, and their use is strongly discouraged
in favor of Device Tree, ACPI or as last resort software
firmware nodes.

Drop the external header and copy the platform data into
the driver file.
