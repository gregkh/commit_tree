net: hns3: Align type of some variables with their print type

The c language has a set of implicit type conversions, when
two variables perform bitwise or arithmetic operations.

For example, variable A (type u16/u8) -1, its output is int type variable.
u16/u8 will convert to int type implicitly before it does arithmetic
operations. So, change 1 to unsigned type.
