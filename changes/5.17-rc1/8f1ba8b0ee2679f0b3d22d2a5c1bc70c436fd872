wcn36xx: ensure pairing of init_scan/finish_scan and start_scan/end_scan

An SMD capture from the downstream prima driver on WCN3680B shows the
following command sequence for connected scans:

- init_scan_req
    - start_scan_req, channel 1
    - end_scan_req, channel 1
    - start_scan_req, channel 2
    - ...
    - end_scan_req, channel 3
- finish_scan_req
- init_scan_req
    - start_scan_req, channel 4
    - ...
    - end_scan_req, channel 6
- finish_scan_req
- ...
    - end_scan_req, channel 165
- finish_scan_req

Upstream currently never calls wcn36xx_smd_end_scan, and in some cases[1]
still sends finish_scan_req twice in a row or before init_scan_req. A
typical connected scan looks like this:

- init_scan_req
    - start_scan_req, channel 1
- finish_scan_req
- init_scan_req
    - start_scan_req, channel 2
- ...
    - start_scan_req, channel 165
- finish_scan_req
- finish_scan_req

This patch cleans up scanning so that init/finish and start/end are always
paired together and correctly nested.

- init_scan_req
    - start_scan_req, channel 1
    - end_scan_req, channel 1
- finish_scan_req
- init_scan_req
    - start_scan_req, channel 2
    - end_scan_req, channel 2
- ...
    - start_scan_req, channel 165
    - end_scan_req, channel 165
- finish_scan_req

Note that upstream will not do batching of 3 active-probe scans before
returning to the operating channel, and this patch does not change that.
To match downstream in this aspect, adjust IEEE80211_PROBE_DELAY and/or
the 125ms max off-channel time in ieee80211_scan_state_decision.

[1]: commit d195d7aac09b ("wcn36xx: Ensure finish scan is not requested
before start scan") addressed one case of finish_scan_req being sent
without a preceding init_scan_req (the case of the operating channel
coinciding with the first scan channel); two other cases are:
1) if SW scan is started and aborted immediately, without scanning any
   channels, we send a finish_scan_req without ever sending init_scan_req,
   and
2) as SW scan logic always returns us to the operating channel before
   calling wcn36xx_sw_scan_complete, finish_scan_req is always sent twice
   at the end of a SW scan
