net: axienet: increase default TX ring size to 128

With previous changes to make the driver handle the TX ring size more
correctly, the default TX ring size of 64 appears to significantly
bottleneck TX performance to around 600 Mbps on a 1 Gbps link on ZynqMP.
Increasing this to 128 seems to bring performance up to near line rate and
shouldn't cause excess bufferbloat (this driver doesn't yet support modern
byte-based queue management).
