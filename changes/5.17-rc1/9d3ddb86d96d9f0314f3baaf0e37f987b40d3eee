KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Demand fault PMU SPRs when marked not inuse

The pmcregs_in_use field in the guest VPA can not be trusted to reflect
what the guest is doing with PMU SPRs, so the PMU must always be managed
(stopped) when exiting the guest, and SPR values set when entering the
guest to ensure it can't cause a covert channel or otherwise cause other
guests or the host to misbehave.

So prevent guest access to the PMU with HFSCR[PM] if pmcregs_in_use is
clear, and avoid the PMU SPR access on every partition switch. Guests
that set pmcregs_in_use incorrectly or when first setting it and using
the PMU will take a hypervisor facility unavailable interrupt that will
bring in the PMU SPRs.
