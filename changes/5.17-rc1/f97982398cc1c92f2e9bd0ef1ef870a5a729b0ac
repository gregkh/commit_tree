libbpf: Avoid reading past ELF data section end when copying license

Fix possible read beyond ELF "license" data section if the license
string is not properly zero-terminated. Use the fact that libbpf_strlcpy
never accesses the (N-1)st byte of the source string because it's
replaced with '\0' anyways.

If this happens, it's a violation of contract between libbpf and a user,
but not handling this more robustly upsets CIFuzz, so given the fix is
trivial, let's fix the potential issue.
