mm/slob: Remove unnecessary page_mapcount_reset() function call

After commit 401fb12c68c2 ("mm/sl*b: Differentiate struct slab fields by
sl*b implementations"), we can reorder fields of struct slab depending
on slab allocator.

For now, page_mapcount_reset() is called because page->_mapcount and
slab->units have same offset. But this is not necessary for struct slab.
Use unused field for units instead.
