media: mtk-vcodec: fix debugging defines

The mtk-vcodec uses some internal defined debug formats for
printing. This patch fixes some things in those defines:

1. use the 'pr_fmt' define to print function name and line.

2. remove 'if(DEBUG)' condition for the defines. This condition
prevents the debugs from being shown in case of dynamic debugs.
Instead replace 'pr_info' with 'pr_debug'

3. remove module parameters that enable/disable debug.
There is no reason for the driver to have those params. Having
those params require the user to explicitly set them when user
wants to see debug prints instead of using the global debugs
setting as expected by drivers to conform.

In addition to that, fix some warnings about debug formatting
