firmware: qemu_fw_cfg: fix NULL-pointer deref on duplicate entries

Commit fe3c60684377 ("firmware: Fix a reference count leak.") "fixed"
a kobject leak in the file registration helper by properly calling
kobject_put() for the entry in case registration of the object fails
(e.g. due to a name collision).

This would however result in a NULL pointer dereference when the
release function tries to remove the never added entry from the
fw_cfg_entry_cache list.

Fix this by moving the list-removal out of the release function.

Note that the offending commit was one of the benign looking umn.edu
fixes which was reviewed but not reverted. [1][2]
