platform/x86: amd-pmc: Add support for AMD Smart Trace Buffer

STB (Smart Trace Buffer), is a debug trace buffer that isolates the
failures by analyzing the last running feature of a system. This
non-intrusive way always runs in the background and stores the trace
into the SoC.

This patch enables the STB feature by passing module param
"enable_stb=1" while loading the driver and provides mechanism to
access the STB buffer using the read and write routines.
