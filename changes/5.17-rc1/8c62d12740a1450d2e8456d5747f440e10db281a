SUNRPC/NFSD: clean up get/put functions.

svc_destroy() is poorly named - it doesn't necessarily destroy the svc,
it might just reduce the ref count.
nfsd_destroy() is poorly named for the same reason.

This patch:
 - removes the refcount functionality from svc_destroy(), moving it to
   a new svc_put().  Almost all previous callers of svc_destroy() now
   call svc_put().
 - renames nfsd_destroy() to nfsd_put() and improves the code, using
   the new svc_destroy() rather than svc_put()
 - removes a few comments that explain the important for balanced
   get/put calls.  This should be obvious.

The only non-trivial part of this is that svc_destroy() would call
svc_sock_update() on a non-final decrement.  It can no longer do that,
and svc_put() isn't really a good place of it.  This call is now made
from svc_exit_thread() which seems like a good place.  This makes the
call *before* sv_nrthreads is decremented rather than after.  This
is not particularly important as the call just sets a flag which
causes sv_nrthreads set be checked later.  A subsequent patch will
improve the ordering.
