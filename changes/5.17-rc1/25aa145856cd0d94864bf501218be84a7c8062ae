powerpc/time: add API for KVM to re-arm the host timer/decrementer

Rather than have KVM look up the host timer and fiddle with the
irq-work internal details, have the powerpc/time.c code provide a
function for KVM to re-arm the Linux timer code when exiting a
guest.

This is implementation has an improvement over existing code of
marking a decrementer interrupt as soft-pending if a timer has
expired, rather than setting DEC to a -ve value, which tended to
cause host timers to take two interrupts (first hdec to exit the
guest, then the immediate dec).
