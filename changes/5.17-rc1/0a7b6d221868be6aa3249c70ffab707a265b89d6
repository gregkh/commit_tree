net: hns3: create new cmdq hardware description structure hclge_comm_hw

Currently PF and VF cmdq APIs use struct hclge(vf)_hw to describe cmdq
hardware information needed by hclge(vf)_cmd_send. There are a little
differences between its child struct hclge_cmq_ring and hclgevf_cmq_ring.
It is redundent to use two sets of structures to support same functions.

So this patch creates new set of common cmdq hardware description
structures(hclge_comm_hw) to unify PF and VF cmdq functions. The struct
hclge_desc is still kept to avoid too many meaningless replacement.

These new structures will be used to unify hclge(vf)_hw structures in PF
and VF cmdq APIs in next patches.
