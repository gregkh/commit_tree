scsi: mpi3mr: Add support for PCIe Managed Switch SES device

The SAS4 Controller firmware exposes the SES devices in Managed PCIe Switch
as a PCIe Device Type SCSI Device
(MPI3_DEVICE0_PCIE_DEVICE_INFO_TYPE_SCSI_DEVICE).

Driver is enhanced to handle this device type by:

 - Exposing the device to the upper layers and

 - Not updating any hardware sectors & virtual boundary settings as these
   settings are needed only for NVMe devices.
