ASoC: SOF: sof-audio: setup sched widgets during pipeline complete step

Older firmware prior to ABI 3.19 has a dependency where the scheduler
widgets need to be setup last. Moving the call to sof_widget_setup()
before the pipeline_complete() call also helps remove the need for the
'reverse' direction when walking through the widget list - this was
only working because of the topology macros but the topology does not
require any order.
