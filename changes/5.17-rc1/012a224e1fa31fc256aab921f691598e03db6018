s390/uaccess: introduce bit field for OAC specifier

Previously, we've used  magic values to specify the OAC
(operand-access control) for mvcos.

Instead we introduce a bit field for it.

When using a bit field, we cannot use an immediate value with K
constraint anymore, since GCC older than 10 doesn't recognize
the bit field union as a compile time constant.
To make things work with older compilers,
load the OAC value through a register.

Bloat-o-meter reports a slight increase in kernel size with this change:
Total: Before=15692135, After=15693015, chg +0.01%
