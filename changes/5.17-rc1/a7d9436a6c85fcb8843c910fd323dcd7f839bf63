interconnect: qcom: rpm: Prevent integer overflow in rate

Using icc-rpm on ARM32 currently results in clk_set_rate() errors during
boot, e.g. "bus clk_set_rate error: -22". This is very similar to commit
7381e27b1e56 ("interconnect: qcom: msm8974: Prevent integer overflow in rate")
where the u64 is converted to a signed long during clock rate rounding,
resulting in an overflow on 32-bit platforms.

Let's fix it similarly by making sure that the rate does not exceed
LONG_MAX. Such high clock rates will surely result in the maximum
frequency of the bus anyway.
