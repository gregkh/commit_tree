cifs: cifs_ses_mark_for_reconnect should also update reconnect bits

Recent restructuring of cifs_reconnect introduced a helper func
named cifs_ses_mark_for_reconnect, which updates the state of tcp
session for all the channels of a session for reconnect.

However, this does not update the session state and chans_need_reconnect
bitmask. This change fixes that.

Also, cifs_mark_tcp_sess_for_reconnect should mark set the bitmask
for all channels when the whole session is marked for reconnect.
Fixed that here too.
