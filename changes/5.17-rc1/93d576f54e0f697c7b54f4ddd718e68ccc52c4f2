mt76: remove variable set but not used

The code that uses variable queued has been removed,
and "mt76_is_usb(dev) ? q->ndesc - q->queued : q->queued"
didn't do anything, so all they should be removed as well.

Eliminate the following clang warnings:
drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/debugfs.c:77:9: warning: variable
‘queued’ set but not used.
