dt-bindings: mmc: exynos-dw-mshc: Add support for ARTPEC-8

The ARTPEC-8 SoC has a DWMMC controller that is compatible with the
Exynos 7 version v2.70a. The main differences from Exynos 7 is that it
does not support HS400 and has extended data read timeout.

Add compatibility string "axis,artpec8-dw-mshc" for ARTPEC-8.
