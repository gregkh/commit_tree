tracing: Add ustring operation to filtering string pointers

Since referencing user space pointers is special, if the user wants to
filter on a field that is a pointer to user space, then they need to
specify it.

Add a ".ustring" attribute to the field name for filters to state that the
field is pointing to user space such that the kernel can take the
appropriate action to read that pointer.
