perf: Add wrappers for invoking guest callbacks

Add helpers for the guest callbacks to prepare for burying the callbacks
behind a Kconfig (it's a lot easier to provide a few stubs than to #ifdef
piles of code), and also to prepare for converting the callbacks to
static_call().  perf_instruction_pointer() in particular will have subtle
semantics with static_call(), as the "no callbacks" case will return 0 if
the callbacks are unregistered between querying guest state and getting
the IP.  Implement the change now to avoid a functional change when adding
static_call() support, and because the new helper needs to return
_something_ in this case.
