net: macb: use .mac_select_pcs() interface

Convert the PCS selection to use mac_select_pcs, which allows the PCS
to perform any validation it needs.

We must use separate phylink_pcs instances for the USX and SGMII PCS,
rather than just changing the "ops" pointer before re-setting it to
phylink as this interface queries the PCS, rather than requesting it
to be changed.
