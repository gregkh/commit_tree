usb: Add Xen pvUSB protocol description

Add the definition of pvUSB protocol used between the pvUSB frontend in
a Xen domU and the pvUSB backend in a Xen driver domain (usually Dom0).

This header was originally provided by Fujitsu for Xen based on Linux
2.6.18.

Changes are:
- adapt to Linux kernel style guide
- use Xen namespace
- add lots of comments
- don't use kernel internal defines
