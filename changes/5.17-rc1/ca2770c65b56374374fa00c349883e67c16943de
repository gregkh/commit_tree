IB/iser: Align coding style across driver

The following changes were made:
1. Align function signatures to 80 characters per line.
2. Remove tabs for variable assignment and use 1 space instead.
3. Don't compare to NULL in "if" clause.
4. Remove strange indentations.

This will ease on the maintenance of the driver for the future.
