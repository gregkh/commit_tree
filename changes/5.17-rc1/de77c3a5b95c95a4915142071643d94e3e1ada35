exit: Move force_uaccess back into do_exit

With kernel threads on architectures that still have set_fs/get_fs
running as KERNEL_DS moving force_uaccess_begin does not appear safe.
Calling force_uaccess_begin is a noop on anything people care about.

Update the comment to explain why this code while looking like an
obvious candidate for moving to make_task_dead probably needs to
remain in do_exit until set_fs/get_fs are entirely removed from the
kernel.
