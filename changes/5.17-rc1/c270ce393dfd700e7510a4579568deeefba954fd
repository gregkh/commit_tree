x86/fpu: Add guest support to xfd_enable_feature()

Guest support for dynamically enabled FPU features requires a few
modifications to the enablement function which is currently invoked from
the #NM handler:

  1) Use guest permissions and sizes for the update

  2) Update fpu_guest state accordingly

  3) Take into account that the enabling can be triggered either from a
     running guest via XSETBV and MSR_IA32_XFD write emulation or from
     a guest restore. In the latter case the guests fpstate is not the
     current tasks active fpstate.

Split the function and implement the guest mechanics throughout the
callchain.
