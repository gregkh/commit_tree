x86/mm: Flush global TLB when switching to trampoline page-table

Move the switching code into a function so that it can be re-used and
add a global TLB flush. This makes sure that usage of memory which is
not mapped in the trampoline page-table is reliably caught.

Also move the clearing of CR4.PCIDE before the CR3 switch because the
cr4_clear_bits() function will access data not mapped into the
trampoline page-table.
