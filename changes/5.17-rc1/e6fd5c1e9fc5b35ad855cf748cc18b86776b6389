ARM: tegra: Add usb-role-switch property to USB OTG ports

If an USB port is an OTG port, then we should add the usb-role-switch
property. Otherwise XUSB setup fails and therefore padctl is unable to
set up the ports. This leads to broken USB and PCIe ports. Add the
usb-role-switch properties to Tegra124 device-trees to fix the problem.

The error message shown without this patch is e.g:
usb2-0: usb-role-switch not found for otg mode
