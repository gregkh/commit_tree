net: axienet: reset core on initialization prior to MDIO access

In some cases where the Xilinx Ethernet core was used in 1000Base-X or
SGMII modes, which use the internal PCS/PMA PHY, and the MGT
transceiver clock source for the PCS was not running at the time the
FPGA logic was loaded, the core would come up in a state where the
PCS could not be found on the MDIO bus. To fix this, the Ethernet core
(including the PCS) should be reset after enabling the clocks, prior to
attempting to access the PCS using of_mdio_find_device.
