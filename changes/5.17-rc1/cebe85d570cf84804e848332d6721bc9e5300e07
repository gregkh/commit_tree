ext4: switch to the new mount api

Add the necessary functions for the fs_context_operations. Convert and
rename ext4_remount() and ext4_fill_super() to ext4_get_tree() and
ext4_reconfigure() respectively and switch the ext4 to use the new api.

One user facing change is the fact that we no longer have access to the
entire string of mount options provided by mount(2) since the mount api
does not store it anywhere. As a result we can't print the options to
the log as we did in the past after the successful mount.
