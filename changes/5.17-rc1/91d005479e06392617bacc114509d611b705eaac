mm/hwpoison: mf_mutex for soft offline and unpoison

Patch series "mm/hwpoison: fix unpoison_memory()", v4.

The main purpose of this series is to sync unpoison code to recent
changes around how hwpoison code takes page refcount.  Unpoison should
work or simply fail (without crash) if impossible.

The recent works of keeping hwpoison pages in shmem pagecache introduce
a new state of hwpoisoned pages, but unpoison for such pages is not
supported yet with this series.

It seems that soft-offline and unpoison can be used as general purpose
page offline/online mechanism (not in the context of memory error).  I
think that we need some additional works to realize it because currently
soft-offline and unpoison are assumed not to happen so frequently (print
out too many messages for aggressive usecases).  But anyway this could
be another interesting next topic.

This patch (of 3):

Originally mf_mutex is introduced to serialize multiple MCE events, but
it is not that useful to allow unpoison to run in parallel with
memory_failure() and soft offline.  So apply mf_mutex to soft offline
and unpoison.  The memory failure handler and soft offline handler get
simpler with this.
