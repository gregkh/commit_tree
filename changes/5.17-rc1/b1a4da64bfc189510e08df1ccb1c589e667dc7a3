RDMA/qedr: Fix reporting max_{send/recv}_wr attrs

Fix the wrongly reported max_send_wr and max_recv_wr attributes for user
QP by making sure to save their valuse on QP creation, so when query QP is
called the attributes will be reported correctly.

Fixes: cecbcddf6461 ("qedr: Add support for QP verbs")
