KVM: x86/mmu: Improve TLB flush comment in kvm_mmu_slot_remove_write_access()

Rewrite the comment in kvm_mmu_slot_remove_write_access() that explains
why it is safe to flush TLBs outside of the MMU lock after
write-protecting SPTEs for dirty logging. The current comment is a long
run-on sentence that was difficult to understand. In addition it was
specific to the shadow MMU (mentioning mmu_spte_update()) when the TDP
MMU has to handle this as well.

The new comment explains:
 - Why the TLB flush is necessary at all.
 - Why it is desirable to do the TLB flush outside of the MMU lock.
 - Why it is safe to do the TLB flush outside of the MMU lock.

No functional change intended.
