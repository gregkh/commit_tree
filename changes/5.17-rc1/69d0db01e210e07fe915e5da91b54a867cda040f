ubsan: remove CONFIG_UBSAN_OBJECT_SIZE

The object-size sanitizer is redundant to -Warray-bounds, and
inappropriately performs its checks at run-time when all information
needed for the evaluation is available at compile-time, making it quite
difficult to use:

With -Warray-bounds almost enabled globally, it doesn't make sense to
keep this around.
