RISC-V: KVM: Add VM capability to allow userspace get GPA bits

The number of GPA bits supported for a RISC-V Guest/VM is based on the
MMU mode used by the G-stage translation. The KVM RISC-V will detect and
use the best possible MMU mode for the G-stage in kvm_arch_init().

We add a generic VM capability KVM_CAP_VM_GPA_BITS which can be used by
the KVM userspace to get the number of GPA (guest physical address) bits
supported for a Guest/VM.
