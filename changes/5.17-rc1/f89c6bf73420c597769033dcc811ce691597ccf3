drm/amdkfd: correct sdma queue number in kfd device init (v3)

This patch keeps the setting of sdma queue number to the same
after recent KFD code refactor. Additionally, improve code to
use switch case to list IP version to complete kfd device_info
structure filling for IH version assignment. This makes consistency
with the IP parse code in amdgpu_discovery.c.

v2: use dev_warn for the default switch case;
    set default sdma queue per engine(8) and IH handler to v9. (Jonathan)

v3: Fix missed IP version check of Raven.
