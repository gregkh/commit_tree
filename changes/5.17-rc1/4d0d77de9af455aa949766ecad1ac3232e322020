drm/i915: Split pre-skl primary plane update into noarm+arm pair

Chop i9xx_plane_update() into two halves. Fist half becomes
the _noarm() variant, second part the _arm() variant.

Fortunately I have already previously grouped the register
writes into roughtly the correct order, so the split looks
surprisingly clean.

One slightly surprising fact was that the CHV pipe B PRIMPOS/SIZE
registers are self arming unlike their pre-ctg DSPPOS/SIZE
counterparts. In fact all the new CHV pipe B registers are
self arming.

Also we must remind ourselves that i830/i845 are a bit borked
in that all of their plane registers are self-arming.

I didn't do any i915_update_info measurements for this one
alone. I'll get total numbers with the corrsponding sprite
plane changes.

v2: Don't break my precious i830/i845
