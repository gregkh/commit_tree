platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Restore missing hotkey_tablet_mode and hotkey_radio_sw sysfs-attr

Commit c99ca78d67a6 ("platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Switch to common use
of attributes") removed the conditional adding of the
hotkey_tablet_mode and hotkey_radio_sw sysfs-attributes, replacing this
with a hotkey_attr_is_visible() callback which hides them when the
feature is not present.

But this commit forgot to add these 2 attributes to the default
hotkey_attributes[] set, so they would now never get added at all.

Add the 2 attributes to the default hotkey_attributes[] set so that
they are available on systems with these features once more.
