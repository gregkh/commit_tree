mtd: spi-nor: spansion: write 2 bytes when disabling Octal DTR mode

The Octal DTR configuration is stored in the CFR5V register. This
register is 1 byte wide. But 1 byte long transactions are not allowed in
8D-8D-8D mode. Since the next byte address does not contain any
register, it is safe to write any value to it. Write a 0 to it.
