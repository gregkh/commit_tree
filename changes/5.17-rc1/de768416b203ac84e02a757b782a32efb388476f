x86/mce/inject: Avoid out-of-bounds write when setting flags

A contrived zero-length write, for example, by using write(2):

  ...
  ret = write(fd, str, 0);
  ...

to the "flags" file causes:

  BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in flags_write
  Write of size 1 at addr ffff888019be7ddf by task writefile/3787

  CPU: 4 PID: 3787 Comm: writefile Not tainted 5.16.0-rc7+ #12
  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-2 04/01/2014

due to accessing buf one char before its start.

Prevent such out-of-bounds access.
