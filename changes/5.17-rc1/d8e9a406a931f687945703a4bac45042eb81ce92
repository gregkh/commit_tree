serdev: BREAK/FRAME/PARITY/OVERRUN notification prototype V2

Allow serdev device drivers get notified by hardware errors such as BREAK,
FRAME, PARITY and OVERRUN.

With this patch, in the event of an error detected in the UART device driver
the serdev_device_driver will get the newly introduced ->error() callback
invoked if serdev_device_set_error_mask() has previously been used to enable
the type of error. The errors are taken straight from the TTY layer and fed
into the serdev_device_driver after filtering out only enabled errors.

Without this patch the hardware errors never reach the serdev_device_driver.
