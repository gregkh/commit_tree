bpftool: Update the lists of names for maps and prog-attach types

To support the different BPF map or attach types, bpftool must remain
up-to-date with the types supported by the kernel. Let's update the
lists, by adding the missing Bloom filter map type and the perf_event
attach type.

Both missing items were found with test_bpftool_synctypes.py.
