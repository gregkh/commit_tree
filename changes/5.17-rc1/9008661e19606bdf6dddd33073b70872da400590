scsi: ufs: Modify Tactive time setting conditions

The Tactive time determines the waiting time before burst at hibern8 exit
and is determined by hardware at linkup time. However, in the case of
Samsung devices, increase host's Tactive time +100us for stability. If the
HCI's Tactive time is equal or greater than the device, +100us should be
set.
