filemap: Use folio_put_refs() in filemap_free_folio()

This shrinks filemap_free_folio() by 55 bytes in my .config; 24 bytes
from removing the VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO() and 31 bytes from unifying the
small/large folio paths.

We could just use folio_ref_sub() here since the caller should hold a
reference (as the VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO() was asserting), but that's fragile.
