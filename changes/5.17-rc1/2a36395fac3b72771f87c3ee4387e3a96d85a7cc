SUNRPC: use sv_lock to protect updates to sv_nrthreads.

Using sv_lock means we don't need to hold the service mutex over these
updates.

In particular,  svc_exit_thread() no longer requires synchronisation, so
threads can exit asynchronously.

Note that we could use an atomic_t, but as there are many more read
sites than writes, that would add unnecessary noise to the code.
Some reads are already racy, and there is no need for them to not be.
