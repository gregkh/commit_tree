signal: Make coredump handling explicit in complete_signal

Ever since commit 6cd8f0acae34 ("coredump: ensure that SIGKILL always
kills the dumping thread") it has been possible for a SIGKILL received
during a coredump to set SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT and trigger a process
shutdown (for a second time).

Update the logic to explicitly allow coredumps so that coredumps can
set SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT and shutdown like an ordinary process.
