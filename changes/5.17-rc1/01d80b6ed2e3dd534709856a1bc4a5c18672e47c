staging: rtl8723bs: core: avoid unnecessary if condition

In function rtw_lps_change_dtim_hdl remove the if condition check
to compare the pwrpriv->dtim to dtim . If both are not equal dtim
is getting assign to pwrpriv->dtim. But if both are equal assigning
dtim to pwrpriv->dtim will not make any difference on value. So remove
the unnecessary if condition check.
