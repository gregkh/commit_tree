serial: 8250_dw: Add StarFive JH7100 quirk

On the StarFive JH7100 RISC-V SoC the UART core clocks can't be set to
exactly 16 * 115200Hz and many other common bitrates. Trying this will
only result in a higher input clock, but low enough that the UART's
internal divisor can't come close enough to the baud rate target.
So rather than try to set the input clock it's better to skip the
clk_set_rate call and rely solely on the UART's internal divisor.
