bpf ppc64: Access only if addr is kernel address

On PPC64 with KUAP enabled, any kernel code which wants to
access userspace needs to be surrounded by disable-enable KUAP.
But that is not happening for BPF_PROBE_MEM load instruction.
So, when BPF program tries to access invalid userspace address,
page-fault handler considers it as bad KUAP fault:

  Kernel attempted to read user page (d0000000) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)

Considering the fact that PTR_TO_BTF_ID (which uses BPF_PROBE_MEM
mode) could either be a valid kernel pointer or NULL but should
never be a pointer to userspace address, execute BPF_PROBE_MEM load
only if addr is kernel address, otherwise set dst_reg=0 and move on.

This will catch NULL, valid or invalid userspace pointers. Only bad
kernel pointer will be handled by BPF exception table.
