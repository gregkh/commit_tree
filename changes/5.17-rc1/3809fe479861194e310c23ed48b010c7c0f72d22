HID: address kernel-doc warnings

The command ./scripts/kernel-doc -none include/linux/hid.h reports:

  include/linux/hid.h:818: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct hid_ll_driver '
  include/linux/hid.h:1135: warning: expecting prototype for hid_may_wakeup(). Prototype was for hid_hw_may_wakeup() instead

Address those kernel-doc warnings.
