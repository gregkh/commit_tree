scsi: lpfc: Use struct_group() to initialize struct lpfc_cgn_info

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memset(), avoid intentionally writing across
neighboring fields.

Add struct_group() to mark "stat" region of struct lpfc_cgn_info that
should be initialized to zero, and refactor the "data" region memset()
to wipe everything up to the cgn_stats region.
