KVM: arm64: Expose unshare hypercall to the host

Introduce an unshare hypercall which can be used to unmap memory from
the hypervisor stage-1 in nVHE protected mode. This will be useful to
update the EL2 ownership state of pages during guest teardown, and
avoids keeping dangling mappings to unreferenced portions of memory.
