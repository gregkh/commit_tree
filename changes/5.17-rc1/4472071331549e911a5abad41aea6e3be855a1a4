fs: use low-level mapping helpers

In a few places the vfs needs to interact with bare k{g,u}ids directly
instead of struct inode. These are just a few. In previous patches we
introduced low-level mapping helpers that are able to support
filesystems mounted an idmapping. This patch simply converts the places
to use these new helpers.
