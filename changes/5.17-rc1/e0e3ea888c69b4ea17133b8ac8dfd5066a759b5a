libbpf: Allow passing user log setting through bpf_object_open_opts

Allow users to provide their own custom log_buf, log_size, and log_level
at bpf_object level through bpf_object_open_opts. This log_buf will be
used during BTF loading. Subsequent patch will use same log_buf during
BPF program loading, unless overriden at per-bpf_program level.

When such custom log_buf is provided, libbpf won't be attempting
retrying loading of BTF to try to provide its own log buffer to capture
kernel's error log output. User is responsible to provide big enough
buffer, otherwise they run a risk of getting -ENOSPC error from the
bpf() syscall.

See also comments in bpf_object_open_opts regarding log_level and
log_buf interactions.
