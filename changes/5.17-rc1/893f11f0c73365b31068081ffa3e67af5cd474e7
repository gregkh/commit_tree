drm/i915: drop unneeded make_unshrinkable in free_object

The comment here is no longer accurate, since the current shrinker code
requires a full ref before touching any objects. Also unset_pages()
should already do the required make_unshrinkable() for us, if needed,
which is also nicely balanced with set_pages().
