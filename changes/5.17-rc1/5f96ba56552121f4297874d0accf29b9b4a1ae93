ACPI: PMIC: xpower: Fix _TMP ACPI errors

On some devices with a X-Powers AXP288 PMIC the LPAT tables in the ACPI
node for the AXP288 PMIC for some reason only describe a small temperature
range, e.g. 27° - 37° Celcius (assuming the entries are in millidegrees).

When the tablet is idle in a room at 21° degrees this is causing values
outside the LPAT table to be read, causing e.g. the following 2 errors
to get spammed to the logs every 4 seconds! :

[ 7512.791316] ACPI Error: AE_ERROR, Returned by Handler for [UserDefinedRegion] (20210930/evregion-281)
[ 7512.791611] ACPI Error: Aborting method \_SB.SXP1._TMP due to previous error (AE_ERROR) (20210930/psparse-529)

Fix this by clamping the raw value to the LPAT table range before
passing it to acpi_lpat_raw_to_temp().

Note clamping has been chosen rather then extrapolating because it is
unknown how other parts of the ACPI tables will respond to temperature
values outside of the LPAT range.
