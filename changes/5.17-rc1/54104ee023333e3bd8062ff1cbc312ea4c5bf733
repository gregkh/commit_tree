clk: lan966x: Add lan966x SoC clock driver

This adds Generic Clock Controller driver for lan966x SoC.

Lan966x clock controller contains 3 PLLs - cpu_clk, ddr_clk
and sys_clk. It generates and supplies clock to various
peripherals within SoC.
Register settings required to provide GCK clocking to a
peripheral is as below:
GCK_SRC_SEL     = Select clock source.
GCK_PRESCALER   = Set divider value.
GCK_ENA         = 1 - Enable GCK clock.
