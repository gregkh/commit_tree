scripts/tags: add space regexs to all regex_c

When "make tags", it prompts a warning:

    ctags: Warning: drivers/pci/controller/pcie-apple.c:150:
    null expansion of name pattern "\1"

The reason is that there is an indentation beside arguments of
DECLARE_BITMAP, but it can parsed normally by gtags. It's also
allowed in C.

Regex [:space:] can match any white space character, so it's a
better approach to add it to each item in regex_c.
