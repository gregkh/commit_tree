mfd: intel-lpss: Fix too early PM enablement in the ACPI ->probe()

The runtime PM callback may be called as soon as the runtime PM facility
is enabled and activated. It means that ->suspend() may be called before
we finish probing the device in the ACPI case. Hence, NULL pointer
dereference:

  intel-lpss INT34BA:00: IRQ index 0 not found
  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000030
  ...
  Workqueue: pm pm_runtime_work
  RIP: 0010:intel_lpss_suspend+0xb/0x40 [intel_lpss]

To fix this, first try to register the device and only after that enable
runtime PM facility.
