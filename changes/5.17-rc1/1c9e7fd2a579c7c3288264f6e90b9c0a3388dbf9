net: dsa: hellcreek: convert to phylink_generic_validate()

Populate the supported interfaces and MAC capabilities for the
hellcreek DSA switch and remove the old validate implementation to
allow DSA to use phylink_generic_validate() for this switch driver.

The switch actually only supports MII and RGMII, but as phylib defaults
to GMII, we need to include this interface mode to keep existing DT
working.
