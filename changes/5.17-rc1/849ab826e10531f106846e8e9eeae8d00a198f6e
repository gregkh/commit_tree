docs: sysfs-block: fill in missing documentation from queue-sysfs.rst

sysfs documentation is supposed to go in Documentation/ABI/.
However, /sys/block/<disk>/queue/* are documented in
Documentation/block/queue-sysfs.rst, and sometimes redundantly in
Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-block too.

Let's consolidate this documentation into Documentation/ABI/.

Therefore, copy the relevant docs from queue-sysfs.rst into sysfs-block.

This primarily means adding the 25 missing files that were documented in
queue-sysfs.rst only, as well as mentioning the RO/RW status of files.

Documentation/ABI/ requires "Date" and "Contact" fields.  For the Date
fields, I used the date of the commit which added support for each file.
For the "Contact" fields, I used linux-block.
