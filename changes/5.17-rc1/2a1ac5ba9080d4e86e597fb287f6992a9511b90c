drm/msm: Increase gpu boost interval

Currently, we boost gpu freq after 25ms of inactivity. This regresses
some of the 30 fps usecases where the workload on gpu (at 33ms internval)
is very small which it can finish at the lowest OPP before the deadline.
Lets increase this inactivity threshold to 50ms (same as the current
devfreq interval) to fix this.
