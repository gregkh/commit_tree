hwmon: (dell-smm) Unify i8k_ioctl() and i8k_ioctl_unlocked()

The only purpose of i8k_ioctl() is to call i8k_ioctl_unlocked()
with i8k_mutex held. Judging from the hwmon code, this mutex
only needs to be held when setting the fan speed/mode, so
the operation of I8K_SET_FAN is guaranteed to be atomic.
Unify both functions and reduce the locking of i8k_mutex
to I8K_SET_FAN.

Tested on a Dell Inspiron 3505.
