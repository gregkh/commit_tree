ext4: implement support for get/set fs label

Implement support for FS_IOC_GETFSLABEL and FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL ioctls for
online reading and setting of file system label.

ext4_ioctl_getlabel() is simple, just get the label from the primary
superblock. This might not be the first sb on the file system if
'sb=' mount option is used.

In ext4_ioctl_setlabel() we update what ext4 currently views as a
primary superblock and then proceed to update backup superblocks. There
are two caveats:
 - the primary superblock might not be the first superblock and so it
   might not be the one used by userspace tools if read directly
   off the disk.
 - because the primary superblock might not be the first superblock we
   potentialy have to update it as part of backup superblock update.
   However the first sb location is a bit more complicated than the rest
   so we have to account for that.

The superblock modification is created generic enough so the
infrastructure can be used for other potential superblock modification
operations, such as chaning UUID.

Tested with generic/492 with various configurations. I also checked the
behavior with 'sb=' mount options, including very large file systems
with and without sparse_super/sparse_super2.
