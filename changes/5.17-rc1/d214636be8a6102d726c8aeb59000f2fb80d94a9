habanalabs: pass reset flags to reset thread

The reset flags used by the reset thread are currently a mix of
hard-coded values and a specific flag which is passed from the context
that initiates the reset.
To make it easier to pass more flags in future from this context to the
reset thread, modify it to pass all the original reset flags to the
thread.
