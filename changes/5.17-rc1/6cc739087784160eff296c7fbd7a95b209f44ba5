scsi: Revert "scsi: hisi_sas: Filter out new PHY up events during suspend"

This reverts commit b14a37e011d829404c29a5ae17849d7efb034893.

In that commit, we had to filter out phy-up events during suspend, as it
work cause a deadlock between processing the phyup event and the resume HA
function try to drain the HA event workqueue to complete the resume
process.

Now that we no longer try to drain the HA event queue during the HA resume
processor, the deadlock would not occur, so remove the special handling for
it.
