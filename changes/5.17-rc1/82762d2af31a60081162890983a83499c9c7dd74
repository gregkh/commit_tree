sched/fair: Replace CFS internal cpu_util() with cpu_util_cfs()

cpu_util_cfs() was created by commit d4edd662ac16 ("sched/cpufreq: Use
the DEADLINE utilization signal") to enable the access to CPU
utilization from the Schedutil CPUfreq governor.

Commit a07630b8b2c1 ("sched/cpufreq/schedutil: Use util_est for OPP
selection") added util_est support later.

The only thing cpu_util() is doing on top of what cpu_util_cfs() already
does is to clamp the return value to the [0..capacity_orig] capacity
range of the CPU. Integrating this into cpu_util_cfs() is not harming
the existing users (Schedutil and CPUfreq cooling (latter via
sched_cpu_util() wrapper)).

For straightforwardness, prefer to keep using `int cpu` as the function
parameter over using `struct rq *rq` which might avoid some calls to
cpu_rq(cpu) -> per_cpu(runqueues, cpu) -> RELOC_HIDE().
Update cfs_util()'s documentation and reuse it for cpu_util_cfs().
Remove cpu_util().
