arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Support Lazor/Limozeen rev9

Support Lazor/Limozeen rev9 board where Parade ps8640 is added as the
second source edp bridge.

To support different edp bridge chips in different board revisions,
now we move the #incldue line of the edp bridge dts fragment (e.g.
sc7180-trogdor-ti-sn65dsi86.dtsi) from "sc7180-trogdor-lazor.dtsi" to
per-board-rev dts files.

Since the edp bridge dts fragment overrides 'dsi0_out', which is
defined in "sc7180.dtsi", move the #incldue line of "sc7180.dtsi" from
"sc7180-trogdor-lazor.dtsi" to per-board-rev dts files too, before
the #include line of the edp bridge dts fragment.
