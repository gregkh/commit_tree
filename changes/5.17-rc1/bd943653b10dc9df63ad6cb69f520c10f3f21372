arm64: dts: qcom: Add device tree for Samsung J5 2015 (samsung-j5)

Samsung J5 2015 is a MSM8916 based Smartphone. It is similar to some of the
other MSM8916 devices, especially the Samsung ones.

With this patch initial support for the following is added:
  - eMMC/SD card
  - Buttons
  - USB (although no suiting MUIC driver currently)
  - UART (untested for lack of equipment)
  - WiFi/Bluetooth (WCNSS)

It is worth noting that Samsung J5 with MSM8916 exists in different
generations (e.g Samsung J5 2015 and Samsung J5 2016) which each have
different models (e.g. samsung-j5nlte, samsung-j5xnlte, etc). This patch
is only regarding the 2015 generation, but should work with all of it's
models, as far as we could test.
