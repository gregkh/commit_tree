net: dsa: bcm_sf2: refactor LED regs access

1. Define more regs. Some switches (e.g. BCM4908) have up to 6 regs.
2. Add helper for handling non-lineral port <-> reg mappings.
3. Add support for 12 B LED reg blocks on BCM4908 (different layout)

Complete support for LEDs setup will be implemented once Linux receives
a proper design & implementation for "hardware" LEDs.
