x86/cpu: Don't write CSTAR MSR on Intel CPUs

Intel CPUs do not support SYSCALL in 32-bit mode, but the kernel
initializes MSR_CSTAR unconditionally. That MSR write is normally
ignored by the CPU, but in a TDX guest it raises a #VE trap.

Exclude Intel CPUs from the MSR_CSTAR initialization.

[ tglx: Fixed the subject line and removed the redundant comment. ]
