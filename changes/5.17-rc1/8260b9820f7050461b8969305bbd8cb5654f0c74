x86/sev: Use CC_ATTR attribute to generalize string I/O unroll

INS/OUTS are not supported in TDX guests and cause #UD. Kernel has to
avoid them when running in TDX guest. To support existing usage, string
I/O operations are unrolled using IN/OUT instructions.

AMD SEV platform implements this support by adding unroll
logic in ins#bwl()/outs#bwl() macros with SEV-specific checks.
Since TDX VM guests will also need similar support, use
CC_ATTR_GUEST_UNROLL_STRING_IO and generic cc_platform_has() API to
implement it.

String I/O helpers were the last users of sev_key_active() interface and
sev_enable_key static key. Remove them.

 [ bp: Move comment too and do not delete it. ]
