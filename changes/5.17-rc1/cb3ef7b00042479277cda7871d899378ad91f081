net: sched: sch_netem: Refactor code in 4-state loss generator

Fixed comments to match description with variable names and
refactored code to match the convention as per [1].

To match the convention mapping is done as follows:
State 3 - LOST_IN_BURST_PERIOD
State 4 - LOST_IN_GAP_PERIOD

[1] S. Salsano, F. Ludovici, A. Ordine, "Definition of a general
and intuitive loss model for packet networks and its implementation
in the Netem module in the Linux kernel"
