media: atomisp: fix ifdefs in sh_css.c

 ## `if (pipe->stream->config.mode == IA_CSS_INPUT_MODE_TPG) {` case

The intel-aero atomisp has `#if defined(IS_ISP_2400_SYSTEM)` [1]. It is
to be defined in the following two places [2]:

  - css/hive_isp_css_common/system_global.h
  - css/css_2401_csi2p_system/system_global.h

and the former file is to be included on ISP2400 devices, too. So, it
is to be defined for both ISP2400 and ISP2401 devices.

Because the upstreamed atomisp driver now supports only ISP2400 and
ISP2401, just remove the ISP version test again. This matches the other
upstream commits like 3c0538fbad9f ("media: atomisp: get rid of most
checks for ISP2401 version").

While here, moved the comment for define GP_ISEL_TPG_MODE to the
appropriate place.

  ## `isys_stream_descr->polling_mode` case

This does not exist on the intel-aero atomisp. This is because it is
based on css version irci_stable_candrpv_0415_20150521_0458.

On the other hand, the upstreamed atomisp is based on the following css
version depending on the ISP version using ifdefs:

  - ISP2400: irci_stable_candrpv_0415_20150521_0458
  - ISP2401: irci_master_20150911_0724

The `isys_stream_descr->polling_mode` usage was added on updating css
version to irci_master_20150701_0213 [3].

So, it is not a ISP version specific thing, but css version specific
thing. Because the upstreamed atomisp driver uses irci_master_20150911_0724
for ISP2401, re-add the ISP version check for now.

I say "for now" because ISP2401 should eventually use the same css
version with ISP2400 (i.e., irci_stable_candrpv_0415_20150521_0458)

 ## `coord = &me->config.internal_frame_origin_bqs_on_sctbl;` case

it was added on commit 4f744a573db3 ("media: atomisp: make
sh_css_sp_init_pipeline() ISP version independent") for ISP2401. Because
the upstreamed atomisp for the ISP2401 part is based on
irci_master_20150911_0724, hence the difference.

Because the upstreamed atomisp driver uses irci_master_20150911_0724
for ISP2401, revert the test back to `if (IS_ISP2401)`.
