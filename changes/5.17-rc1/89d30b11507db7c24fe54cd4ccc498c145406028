arm64: Drop outdated links in comments

As started by commit 05a5f51ca566 ("Documentation: Replace lkml.org links
with lore"), an effort was made to replace lkml.org links with lore to
better use a single source that's more likely to stay available long-term.
However, it seems these links don't offer much value here, so just
remove them entirely.
