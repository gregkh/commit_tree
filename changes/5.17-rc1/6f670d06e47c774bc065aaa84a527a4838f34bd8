samples: bpf: Fix 'unknown warning group' build warning on Clang

Clang doesn't have 'stringop-truncation' group like GCC does, and
complains about it when building samples which use xdp_sample_user
infra:

 samples/bpf/xdp_sample_user.h:48:32: warning: unknown warning group '-Wstringop-truncation', ignored [-Wunknown-warning-option]
 #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wstringop-truncation"
                                ^
[ repeat ]

Those are harmless, but avoidable when guarding it with ifdef.
I could guard push/pop as well, but this would require one more
ifdef cruft around a single line which I don't think is reasonable.
