net: add networking namespace refcount tracker

We have 100+ syzbot reports about netns being dismantled too soon,
still unresolved as of today.

We think a missing get_net() or an extra put_net() is the root cause.

In order to find the bug(s), and be able to spot future ones,
this patch adds CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER and new helpers
to precisely pair all put_net() with corresponding get_net().

To use these helpers, each data structure owning a refcount
should also use a "netns_tracker" to pair the get and put.
