rcu: Remove the RCU_FAST_NO_HZ Kconfig option

All of the uses of CONFIG_RCU_FAST_NO_HZ=y that I have seen involve
systems with RCU callbacks offloaded.  In this situation, all that this
Kconfig option does is slow down idle entry/exit with an additional
allways-taken early exit.  If this is the only use case, then this
Kconfig option nothing but an attractive nuisance that needs to go away.

This commit therefore removes the RCU_FAST_NO_HZ Kconfig option.
