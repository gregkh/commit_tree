arm64: dts: imx8mp-evk: configure multiple queues on eqos

Eqos ethernet support five queues on hardware, enable these queues and
configure the priority of each queue. Uses Strict Priority as scheduling
algorithms to ensure that the TSN function works.

The priority of each queue is a bitmask value that maps VLAN tag
priority to the queue. Since the hardware only supports five queues,
this patch maps priority 0-4 to queues one by one, and priority 5-7 to
queue 4.

The total fifo size of 5 queues is 8192 bytes, if enable 5 queues with
store-and-forward mode, it's not enough for large packets, which would
trigger fifo overflow frequently. This patch set DMA to thresh mode to
enable all 5 queues.
