arm64: dts: renesas: Fix thermal bindings

The binding node names for the thermal zones are not successfully
validated by the dt-schemas.

Fix the validation by changing from sensor-thermalN or thermal-sensor-N
to sensorN-thermal.  Provide node labels of the form sensorN_thermal to
ensure consistency with the other platform implementations.
