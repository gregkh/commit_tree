exfat: fix i_blocks for files truncated over 4 GiB

In exfat_truncate(), the computation of inode->i_blocks is wrong if
the file is larger than 4 GiB because a 32-bit variable is used as a
mask. This is fixed and simplified by using round_up().

Also fix the same buggy computation in exfat_read_root() and another
(correct) one in exfat_fill_inode(). The latter was fixed another way
last month but can be simplified by using round_up() as well. See:

  commit 0c336d6e33f4 ("exfat: fix incorrect loading of i_blocks for
                        large files")
