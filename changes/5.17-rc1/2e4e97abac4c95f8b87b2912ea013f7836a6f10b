btrfs: pass fs_info to trace_btrfs_transaction_commit

The root on the trans->root can be anything, and generally we're
committing from the transaction kthread so it's usually the tree_root.
Change this to just take an fs_info, and to maintain compatibility
simply put the ROOT_TREE_OBJECTID as the root objectid for the
tracepoint.  This will allow use to remove trans->root.
