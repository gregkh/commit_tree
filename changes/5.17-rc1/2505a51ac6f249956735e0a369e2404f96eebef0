locking/barriers, kcsan: Support generic instrumentation

Thus far only smp_*() barriers had been defined by asm-generic/barrier.h
based on __smp_*() barriers, because the !SMP case is usually generic.

With the introduction of instrumentation, it also makes sense to have
asm-generic/barrier.h assist in the definition of instrumented versions
of mb(), rmb(), wmb(), dma_rmb(), and dma_wmb().

Because there is no requirement to distinguish the !SMP case, the
definition can be simpler: we can avoid also providing fallbacks for the
__ prefixed cases, and only check if `defined(__<barrier>)`, to finally
define the KCSAN-instrumented versions.

This also allows for the compiler to complain if an architecture
accidentally defines both the normal and __ prefixed variant.
