ARM: 9158/1: leave it to core code to manage thread_info::cpu

Since commit bcf9033e5449 ("sched: move CPU field back into thread_info
if THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK=y"), the CPU field in thread_info went back to
being managed by the core code, so we no longer have to keep it in sync
in arch code.

While at it, mark THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK as done for ARM in the
documentation.
