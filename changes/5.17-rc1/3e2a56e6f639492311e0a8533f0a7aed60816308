tracing: Have syscall trace events use trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve()

Currently, the syscall trace events call trace_buffer_lock_reserve()
directly, which means that it misses out on some of the filtering
optimizations provided by the helper function
trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve(). Have the syscall trace events call that
instead, as it was missed when adding the update to use the temp buffer
when filtering.
