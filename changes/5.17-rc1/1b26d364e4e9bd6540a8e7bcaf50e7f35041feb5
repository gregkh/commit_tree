net: dsa: warn about dsa_port and dsa_switch bit fields being non atomic

As discussed during review here:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20220105132141.2648876-3-vladimir.oltean@nxp.com/

we should inform developers about pitfalls of concurrent access to the
boolean properties of dsa_switch and dsa_port, now that they've been
converted to bit fields. No other measure than a comment needs to be
taken, since the code paths that update these bit fields are not
concurrent with each other.
