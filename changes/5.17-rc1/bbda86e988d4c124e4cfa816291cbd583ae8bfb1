exit: Implement kthread_exit

The way the per task_struct exit_code is used by kernel threads is not
quite compatible how it is used by userspace applications.  The low
byte of the userspace exit_code value encodes the exit signal.  While
kthreads just use the value as an int holding ordinary kernel function
exit status like -EPERM.

Add kthread_exit to clearly separate the two kinds of uses.
