drm/omap: introduce omap_hw_overlay

Split out the hardware overlay specifics from omap_plane.
To start, the hw overlays are statically assigned to planes.

The goal is to eventually assign hw overlays dynamically to planes
during plane->atomic_check() based on requested caps (scaling, YUV,
etc). And then perform hw overlay re-assignment if required.
