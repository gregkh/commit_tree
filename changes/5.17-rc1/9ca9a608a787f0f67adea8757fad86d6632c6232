ARM: tegra: Add back gpio-ranges properties

The properties have been commented out to prevent a regression a while
ago. The first regression should be resolved by commit 44af7927316e
("spi: Map SPI OF client IRQ at probe time").

The second regression is probably addressed by commit 494fd7b7ad10
("PM / core: fix deferred probe breaking suspend resume order") and/or
maybe others. Readd the gpio-ranges properties to see whether
regressions still get reported.

This reverts commit 4f1d841475e1 ("ARM: tegra: Comment out gpio-ranges
properties").
