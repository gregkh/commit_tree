KVM: x86/cpuid: Clear XFD for component i if the base feature is missing

According to Intel extended feature disable (XFD) spec, the sub-function i
(i > 1) of CPUID function 0DH enumerates "details for state component i.
ECX[2] enumerates support for XFD support for this state component."

If KVM does not report F(XFD) feature (e.g. due to CONFIG_X86_64),
then the corresponding XFD support for any state component i
should also be removed. Translate this dependency into KVM terms.
