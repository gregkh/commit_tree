x86/sgx: Add check for SGX pages to ghes_do_memory_failure()

SGX EPC pages do not have a "struct page" associated with them so the
pfn_valid() sanity check fails and results in a warning message to
the console.

Add an additional check to skip the warning if the address of the error
is in an SGX EPC page.
