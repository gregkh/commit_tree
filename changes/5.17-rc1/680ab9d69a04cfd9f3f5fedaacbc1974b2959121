vdpa: Protect vdpa reset with cf_mutex

Call reset using the wrapper function vdpa_reset() to make sure the
operation is serialized with cf_mutex.

This comes to protect from the following possible scenario:

vhost_vdpa_set_status() could call the reset op. Since the call is not
protected by cf_mutex, a netlink thread calling vdpa_dev_config_fill
could get passed the VIRTIO_CONFIG_S_FEATURES_OK check in
vdpa_dev_config_fill() and end up reporting wrong features.
