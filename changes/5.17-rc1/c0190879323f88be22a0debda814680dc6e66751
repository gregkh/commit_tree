net: hns3: make symbol 'hclge_mac_speed_map_to_fw' static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hns3/hns3pf/hclge_main.c:2656:28: warning:
 symbol 'hclge_mac_speed_map_to_fw' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of hclge_main.c, so marks it static.
