device-dax: ensure dev_dax->pgmap is valid for dynamic devices

Right now, only static dax regions have a valid @pgmap pointer in its
struct dev_dax.  Dynamic dax case however, do not.

In preparation for device-dax compound devmap support, make sure that
dev_dax pgmap field is set after it has been allocated and initialized.

dynamic dax device have the @pgmap is allocated at probe() and it's
managed by devm (contrast to static dax region which a pgmap is provided
and dax core kfrees it).  So in addition to ensure a valid @pgmap, clear
the pgmap when the dynamic dax device is released to avoid the same
pgmap ranges to be re-requested across multiple region device reconfigs.

Add a static_dev_dax() and use that helper in dev_dax_probe() to ensure
the initialization differences between dynamic and static regions are
more explicit.  While at it, consolidate the ranges initialization when
we allocate the @pgmap for the dynamic dax region case.  Also take the
opportunity to document the differences between static and dynamic da
regions.
