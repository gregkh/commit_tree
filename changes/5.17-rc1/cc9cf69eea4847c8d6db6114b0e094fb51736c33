net: lan966x: Fix builds for lan966x driver

The lan966x is using the function 'packing' to create/extract the
information for the IFH, that is used to be added in front of the frames
when they are injected/extracted.
Therefore update the Kconfig to select config option 'PACKING' whenever
lan966x driver is enabled.
