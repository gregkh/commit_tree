crypto: qat - fix definition of ring reset results

The ring reset result values are defined starting from 0x1 instead of 0.
This causes out-of-tree drivers that support this message to understand
that a ring reset failed even if the operation was successful.

Fix by starting the definition of ring reset result values from 0.
