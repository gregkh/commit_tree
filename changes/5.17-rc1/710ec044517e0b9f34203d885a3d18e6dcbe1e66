staging: vc04_services: rename structures bm2835_mmal_dev and bm2835_mmal_v4l2_ctrl

In the kernel, all names related to the chip BCM2835 are always named
bcm2835_*. To avoid confusion, and to make things more consistent,
rename the structures bm2835_mmal_dev and bm2835_mmal_v4l2_ctrl
accordingly.

While at it, one realignment was made to improve readability.
