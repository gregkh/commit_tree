include: move find.h from asm_generic to linux

find_bit API and bitmap API are closely related, but inclusion paths
are different - include/asm-generic and include/linux, correspondingly.
In the past it made a lot of troubles due to circular dependencies
and/or undefined symbols. Fix this by moving find.h under include/linux.
