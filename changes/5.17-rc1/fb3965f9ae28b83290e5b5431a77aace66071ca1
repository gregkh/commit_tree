drm/i915/guc: Flag an error if an engine reset fails

If GuC encounters an error during engine reset, the i915 driver
promotes to full GT reset. This includes an info message about why the
reset is happening. However, that is not treated as a failure by any
of the CI systems because resets are an expected occurrance during
testing. This kind of failure is a major problem and should never
happen. So, complain more loudly and make sure CI notices.
