mac80211: use coarse boottime for airtime fairness code

The time values used by the airtime fairness code only need to be accurate
enough to cover station activity detection.
Using ktime_get_coarse_boottime_ns instead of ktime_get_boottime_ns will
drop the accuracy down to jiffies intervals, but at the same time saves
a lot of CPU cycles in a hot path
