libertas_tf: Use struct_group() for memcpy() region

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field array bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(),
avoid intentionally writing across neighboring fields.

Use struct_group() in struct txpd around members tx_dest_addr_high
and tx_dest_addr_low so they can be referenced together. This will
allow memcpy() and sizeof() to more easily reason about sizes, improve
readability, and avoid future warnings about writing beyond the end
of tx_dest_addr_high.

"pahole" shows no size nor member offset changes to struct txpd.
"objdump -d" shows no object code changes.
