xfs: kill the XFS_IOC_{ALLOC,FREE}SP* ioctls

According to the glibc compat header for Irix 4, these ioctls originated
in April 1991 as a (somewhat clunky) way to preallocate space at the end
of a file on an EFS filesystem.  XFS, which was released in Irix 5.3 in
December 1993, picked up these ioctls to maintain compatibility and they
were ported to Linux in the early 2000s.

Recently it was pointed out to me they still lurk in the kernel, even
though the Linux fallocate syscall supplanted the functionality a long
time ago.  fstests doesn't seem to include any real functional or stress
tests for these ioctls, which means that the code quality is ... very
questionable.  Most notably, it was a stale disk block exposure vector
for 21 years and nobody noticed or complained.  As mature programmers
say, "If you're not testing it, it's broken."

Given all that, let's withdraw these ioctls from the XFS userspace API.
Normally we'd set a long deprecation process, but I estimate that there
aren't any real users, so let's trigger a warning in dmesg and return
-ENOTTY.
