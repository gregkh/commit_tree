bpftool: Normalize compile rules to specify output file last

When dealing with verbose Makefile output, it's extremely confusing when
compiler invocation commands don't specify -o <output.o> as the last
argument. Normalize bpftool's Makefile to do just that, as most other
BPF-related Makefiles are already doing that.
