media: atomisp: binary.c: drop logic incompatible with firmware

As we're using this firmware for ISP2401:
	https://github.com/intel-aero/meta-intel-aero-base/blob/master/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto/shisp_2401a0_v21.bin

It makes no sense to try to select a non-existing binary
inside the firmware. So, revert it to reflect the Intel Aero
device driver.
