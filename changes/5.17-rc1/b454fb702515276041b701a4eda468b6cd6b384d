crypto: jitter - don't limit ->health_failure check to FIPS mode

The jitterentropy's Repetition Count Test (RCT) as well as the Adaptive
Proportion Test (APT) are run unconditionally on any collected samples.
However, their result, i.e. ->health_failure, will only get checked if
fips_enabled is set, c.f. the jent_health_failure() wrapper.

I would argue that a RCT or APT failure indicates that something's
seriously off and that this should always be reported as an error,
independently of whether FIPS mode is enabled or not: it should be up to
callers whether or not and how to handle jitterentropy failures.

Make jent_health_failure() to unconditionally return ->health_failure,
independent of whether fips_enabled is set.

Note that fips_enabled isn't accessed from the jitterentropy code anymore
now. Remove the linux/fips.h include as well as the jent_fips_enabled()
wrapper.
