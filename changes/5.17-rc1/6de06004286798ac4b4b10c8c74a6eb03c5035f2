net: hns3: create new set of common rss set APIs for PF and VF module

Currently, hns3 PF and VF rss module have two sets of rss set APIs to
configure rss. There is no need to keep two sets of these same APIs.

So this patch creates new set of common rss set APIs for PF and VF reuse.
These new APIs will be used to unify old APIs in next patches.
