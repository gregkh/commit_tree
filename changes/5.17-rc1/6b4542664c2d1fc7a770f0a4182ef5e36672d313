pinctrl: baytrail: Set IRQCHIP_SET_TYPE_MASKED flag on the irqchip

The byt_irq_type function ends with the IRQ masked, this means that calls
to irq_set_irq_type() while the IRQ is enabled end up masking it, which
is wrong. Add the IRQCHIP_SET_TYPE_MASKED flag to fix this.

This will make the IRQ core call mask() + unmask() on the IRQ around
a set_type() call when the IRQ is enabled at the type of the call.

Note in practice irq_set_irq_type() getting called while the IRQ is enabled
almost never happens. I hit this with a buggy DSDT where a wrongly active
(_STA returns 0xf) I2C ACPI devices point to an IRQ already in use by an
_AEI handler, leading to the irq_set_irq_type() call in
acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by() getting called while the IRQ is enabled.
