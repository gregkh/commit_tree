net: mscc: ocelot: don't dereference NULL pointers with shared tc filters

The following command sequence:

tc qdisc del dev swp0 clsact
tc qdisc add dev swp0 ingress_block 1 clsact
tc qdisc add dev swp1 ingress_block 1 clsact
tc filter add block 1 flower action drop
tc qdisc del dev swp0 clsact

produces the following NPD:

The reason is that the driver isn't prepared to receive two tc filters
with the same cookie. It unconditionally creates a new struct
ocelot_vcap_filter for each tc filter, and it adds all filters with the
same identifier (cookie) to the ocelot_vcap_block.

The problem is here, in ocelot_vcap_filter_del():

	/* Gets index of the filter */
	index = ocelot_vcap_block_get_filter_index(block, filter);
	if (index < 0)
		return index;

	/* Delete filter */
	ocelot_vcap_block_remove_filter(ocelot, block, filter);

	/* Move up all the blocks over the deleted filter */
	for (i = index; i < block->count; i++) {
		struct ocelot_vcap_filter *tmp;

		tmp = ocelot_vcap_block_find_filter_by_index(block, i);
		vcap_entry_set(ocelot, i, tmp);
	}

what will happen is ocelot_vcap_block_get_filter_index() will return the
index (@index) of the first filter found with that cookie. This is _not_
the index of _this_ filter, but the other one with the same cookie,
because ocelot_vcap_filter_equal() gets fooled.

Then later, ocelot_vcap_block_remove_filter() is coded to remove all
filters that are ocelot_vcap_filter_equal() with the passed @filter.
So unexpectedly, both filters get deleted from the list.

Then ocelot_vcap_filter_del() will attempt to move all the other filters
up, again finding them by index (@i). The block count is 2, @index was 0,
so it will attempt to move up filter @i=0 and @i=1. It assigns tmp =
ocelot_vcap_block_find_filter_by_index(block, i), which is now a NULL
pointer because ocelot_vcap_block_remove_filter() has removed more than
one filter.

As far as I can see, this problem has been there since the introduction
of tc offload support, however I cannot test beyond the blamed commit
due to hardware availability. In any case, any fix cannot be backported
that far, due to lots of changes to the code base.

Therefore, let's go for the correct solution, which is to not call
ocelot_vcap_filter_add() and ocelot_vcap_filter_del(), unless the filter
is actually unique and not shared. For the shared filters, we should
just modify the ingress port mask and call ocelot_vcap_filter_replace(),
a function introduced by commit 95706be13b9f ("net: mscc: ocelot: create
a function that replaces an existing VCAP filter"). This way,
block->rules will only contain filters with unique cookies, by design.
