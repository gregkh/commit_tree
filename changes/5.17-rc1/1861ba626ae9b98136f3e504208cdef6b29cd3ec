virtio_ring: mark ring unused on error

A recently added error path does not mark ring unused when exiting on
OOM, which will lead to BUG on the next entry in debug builds.

TODO: refactor code so we have START_USE and END_USE in the same function.

Fixes: fc6d70f40b3d ("virtio_ring: check desc == NULL when using indirect with packed")
