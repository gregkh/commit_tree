io_uring: fix UAF due to missing POLLFREE handling

Fixes a problem described in 50252e4b5e989
("aio: fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling")
and copies the approach used there.

In short, we have to forcibly eject a poll entry when we meet POLLFREE.
We can't rely on io_poll_get_ownership() as can't wait for potentially
running tw handlers, so we use the fact that wqs are RCU freed. See
Eric's patch and comments for more details.
