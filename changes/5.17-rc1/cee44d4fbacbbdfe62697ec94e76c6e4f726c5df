media: rcar-csi2: Correct the selection of hsfreqrange

hsfreqrange should be chosen based on the calculated mbps which
is closer to the default bit rate  and within the range as per
table[1]. But current calculation always selects first value which
is greater than or equal to the calculated mbps which may lead
to chosing a wrong range in some cases.

For example for 360 mbps for H3/M3N
Existing logic selects
Calculated value 360Mbps : Default 400Mbps Range [368.125 -433.125 mbps]

This hsfreqrange is out of range.

The logic is changed to get the default value which is closest to the
calculated value [1]

Calculated value 360Mbps : Default 350Mbps  Range [320.625 -380.625 mpbs]

[1] specs r19uh0105ej0200-r-car-3rd-generation.pdf [Table 25.9]

Please note that According to Renesas in Table 25.9 the range for
220 default value is corrected as below

 |Range (Mbps)     |  Default  Bit rate (Mbps) |
 -----------------------------------------------
 | 197.125-244.125 |     220                   |
 -----------------------------------------------
