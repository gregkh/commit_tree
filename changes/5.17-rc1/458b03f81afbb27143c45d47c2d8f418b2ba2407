cpufreq: intel_pstate: Drop redundant intel_pstate_get_hwp_cap() call

It is not necessary to call intel_pstate_get_hwp_cap() from
intel_pstate_update_perf_limits(), because it gets called from
intel_pstate_verify_cpu_policy() which is either invoked directly
right before intel_pstate_update_perf_limits(), in
intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() in the passive mode, or called
from driver callbacks in a sequence that causes it to be followed
by an immediate intel_pstate_update_perf_limits().

Namely, in the active mode intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() is called
by intel_pstate_verify_policy() which is the ->verify() callback
routine of intel_pstate and gets called by the cpufreq core right
before intel_pstate_set_policy(), which is the driver's ->setoplicy()
callback routine, where intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() is called.
