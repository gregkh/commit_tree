powerpc/code-patching: Remove pr_debug()/pr_devel() messages and fix check()

code-patching has been working for years now, time has come to
remove debugging messages.

Change useful message to KERN_INFO and remove other ones.

Also add KERN_ERR to check() macro and change it into a do/while
to make checkpatch happy.
