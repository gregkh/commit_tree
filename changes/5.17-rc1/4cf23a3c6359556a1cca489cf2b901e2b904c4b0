libbpf: Fix bpf_prog_load() log_buf logic for log_level 0

To unify libbpf APIs behavior w.r.t. log_buf and log_level, fix
bpf_prog_load() to follow the same logic as bpf_btf_load() and
high-level bpf_object__load() API will follow in the subsequent patches:
  - if log_level is 0 and non-NULL log_buf is provided by a user, attempt
    load operation initially with no log_buf and log_level set;
  - if successful, we are done, return new FD;
  - on error, retry the load operation with log_level bumped to 1 and
    log_buf set; this way verbose logging will be requested only when we
    are sure that there is a failure, but will be fast in the
    common/expected success case.

Of course, user can still specify log_level > 0 from the very beginning
to force log collection.
