selftests/sgx: Dump segments and /proc/self/maps only on failure

Logging is always a compromise between clarity and detail. The main use
case for dumping VMA's is when FIXTURE_SETUP() fails, and is less important
for enclaves that do initialize correctly. Therefore, print the segments
and /proc/self/maps only in the error case.

Finally, if a single test ever creates multiple enclaves, the amount of
log lines would become enormous.
