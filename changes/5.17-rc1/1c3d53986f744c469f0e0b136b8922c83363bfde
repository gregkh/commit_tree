rcutorture: More thoroughly test nested readers

Currently, nested readers occur only when a timer handler interrupts a
reader.  This is rare, and is thus insufficient testing of the transition
between nesting levels.  This commit therefore causes rcutorture nested
readers to be the rule rather than the exception.
