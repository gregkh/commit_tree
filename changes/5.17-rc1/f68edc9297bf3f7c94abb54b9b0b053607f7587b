lib: add find_first_and_bit()

Currently find_first_and_bit() is an alias to find_next_and_bit(). However,
it is widely used in cpumask, so it worth to optimize it. This patch adds
its own implementation for find_first_and_bit().

On x86_64 find_bit_benchmark says:

Before (#define find_first_and_bit(...) find_next_and_bit(..., 0):
Start testing find_bit() with random-filled bitmap
[  140.291468] find_first_and_bit:           46890919 ns,  32671 iterations
Start testing find_bit() with sparse bitmap
[  140.295028] find_first_and_bit:               7103 ns,      1 iterations

After:
Start testing find_bit() with random-filled bitmap
[  162.574907] find_first_and_bit:           25045813 ns,  32846 iterations
Start testing find_bit() with sparse bitmap
[  162.578458] find_first_and_bit:               4900 ns,      1 iterations

(Thanks to Alexey Klimov for thorough testing.)
