of: net: support NVMEM cells with MAC in text format

Some NVMEM devices have text based cells. In such cases MAC is stored in
a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX format. Use mac_pton() to parse such data and
support those NVMEM cells. This is required to support e.g. a very
popular U-Boot and its environment variables.
