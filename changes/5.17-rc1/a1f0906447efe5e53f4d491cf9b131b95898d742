staging: r8188eu: include variable declarations from Hal8188EPwrSeq.h

Variable declarations of rtl8188E_power_on_flow, rtl8188E_card_disable_flow
and rtl8188E_enter_lps_flow are present in Hal8188EPwrSeq.h.

A previous commit changed Hal8188EPwrSeq.c to include HalPwrSeqCmd.h
directly instead of Hal8188EPwrSeq.h, causing these sparse warnings:
- symbol 'rtl8188E_power_on_flow' was not declared. Should it be static?
- symbol 'rtl8188E_card_disable_flow' was not declared.Should it be static?
- symbol 'rtl8188E_enter_lps_flow' was not declared. Should it be static?

This patch reverts the include line to include the declarations.
