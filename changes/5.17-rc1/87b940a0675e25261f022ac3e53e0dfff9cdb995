perf/core: Use static_call to optimize perf_guest_info_callbacks

Use static_call to optimize perf's guest callbacks on arm64 and x86,
which are now the only architectures that define the callbacks.  Use
DEFINE_STATIC_CALL_RET0 as the default/NULL for all guest callbacks, as
the callback semantics are that a return value '0' means "not in guest".

static_call obviously avoids the overhead of CONFIG_RETPOLINE=y, but is
also advantageous versus other solutions, e.g. per-cpu callbacks, in that
a per-cpu memory load is not needed to detect the !guest case.

Based on code from Peter and Like.
