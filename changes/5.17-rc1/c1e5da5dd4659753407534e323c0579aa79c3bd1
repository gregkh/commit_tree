ice: improve switchdev's slow-path

In current switchdev implementation, every VF PR is assigned to
individual ring on switchdev ctrl VSI. For slow-path traffic, there
is a mapping VF->ring done in software based on src_vsi value (by
calling ice_eswitch_get_target_netdev function).

With this change, HW solution is introduced which is more
efficient. For each VF, src MAC (VF's MAC) filter will be created,
which forwards packets to the corresponding switchdev ctrl VSI queue
based on src MAC address.

This filter has to be removed and then replayed in case of
resetting one VF. Keep information about this rule in repr->mac_rule,
thanks to that we know which rule has to be removed and replayed
for a given VF.

In case of CORE/GLOBAL all rules are removed
automatically. We have to take care of readding them. This is done
by ice_replay_vsi_adv_rule.

When driver leaves switchdev mode, remove all advanced rules
from switchdev ctrl VSI. This is done by ice_rem_adv_rule_for_vsi.

Flag repr->rule_added is needed because in some cases reset
might be triggered before VF sends request to add MAC.
