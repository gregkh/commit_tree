iomap: Use folio offsets instead of page offsets

Pass a folio around instead of the page, and make sure the offset
is relative to the start of the folio instead of the start of a page.
Also use size_t for offset & length to make it clear that these are byte
counts, and to support >2GB folios in the future.
