selftests/bpf: Additional test for CO-RE in the kernel.

Add a test where randmap() function is appended to three different bpf
programs. That action checks struct bpf_core_relo replication logic
and offset adjustment in gen loader part of libbpf.

Fourth bpf program has 360 CO-RE relocations from vmlinux, bpf_testmod,
and non-existing type. It tests candidate cache logic.
