arm64: dts: marvell: cn9130: add GPIO and SPI aliases

CN9130 has one CP115 built in, which like the CP110 has 2 GPIO and 2 SPI
controllers built-in.

However, unlike the Armada 7k and 8k the SoC DTSI doesn't add the required
aliases as both the Orion SPI driver and MVEBU GPIO drivers require the
aliases to be present.

So add the required aliases for GPIO and SPI controllers.
