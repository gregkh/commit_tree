drm/i915: Move LPT PCH readout code

Nuke the hsw_get_ddi_port_state() eyesore by putting the
readout code into intel_pch_display.c, and calling it directly
from hsw_crt_get_config().

Note that the nuked TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL readout from
hsw_get_ddi_port_state() is now etirely redundant since we
get called from the encoder->get_config() so we already know
we're dealing with the correct DDI port. Previously the
code was called from a place where that wasn't known so
it had to checked manually.

v2: Clarify the TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL change (Dave)
    Nuke the now unused *TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL_VAL_TO_PORT() (Dave)
