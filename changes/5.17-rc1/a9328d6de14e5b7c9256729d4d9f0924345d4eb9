dt-bindings: remoteproc: k3-r5f: Update bindings for J721S2 SoCs

The TI K3 J721S2 SoCs have three dual-core Arm R5F clusters/subsystems,
with 2 R5F cores each, one in MCU voltage domain and the other two in
MAIN voltage domain.

These clusters are similar to J7200 R5F clusters. Compatible info is
updated for intuitively matching to the new J721S2 SoCs.
