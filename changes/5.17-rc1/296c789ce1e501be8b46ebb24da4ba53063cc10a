ASoC: intel: sof_sdw: add link adr order check

We assume the adr order described in a snd_soc_acpi_link_adr array is
jack -> amp -> mic. We follow the same order to implement the topology.
We will need a special topology if we configure a snd_soc_acpi_link_adr
array with different order. Adding a check and a warning message can
remind people to keep the order when adding a new snd_soc_acpi_link_adr
array.
