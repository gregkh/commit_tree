net: stmmac: Calculate CDC error only once

The clock domain crossing error (CDC) is calculated at every fetch of Tx or Rx
timestamps. It includes a division. Especially on arm32 based systems it is
expensive. It also requires two conditionals in the hotpath.

Add a compensation value cache to struct plat_stmmacenet_data and subtract it
unconditionally in the RX/TX functions which spares the conditionals.

The value is initialized to 0 and if supported calculated in the PTP
initialization code.
