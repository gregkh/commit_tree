can: mcp251xfd: mcp251xfd_open(): make use of pm_runtime_resume_and_get()

With patch

| dd8088d5a896 PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter

the usual pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put_noidle()
in-case-of-error dance is no longer needed. Convert the mcp251xfd
driver to use this function.
