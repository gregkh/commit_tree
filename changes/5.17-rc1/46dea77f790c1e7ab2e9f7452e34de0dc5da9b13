KVM: PPC: Book3S HV Nested: Avoid extra mftb() in nested entry

mftb() is expensive and one can be avoided on nested guest dispatch.

If the time checking code distinguishes between the L0 timer and the
nested HV timer, then both can be tested in the same place with the
same mftb() value.

This also nicely illustrates the relationship between the L0 and nested
HV timers.
