cpufreq: amd-pstate: Introduce the support for the processors with shared memory solution

In some of Zen2 and Zen3 based processors, they are using the shared
memory that exposed from ACPI SBIOS. In this kind of the processors,
there is no MSR support, so we add acpi cppc function as the backend for
them.

It is using a module param (shared_mem) to enable related processors
manually. We will enable this by default once we address performance
issue on this solution.
