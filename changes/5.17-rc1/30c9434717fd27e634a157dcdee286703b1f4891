KVM: Reconcile discrepancies in halt-polling stats

Move the halt-polling "success" and histogram stats update into the
dedicated helper to fix a discrepancy where the success/fail "time" stats
consider polling successful so long as the wait is avoided, but the main
"success" and histogram stats consider polling successful if and only if
a wake event was detected by the halt-polling loop.

Move halt_attempted_poll to the helper as well so that all the stats are
updated in a single location.  While it's a bit odd to update the stat
well after the fact, practically speaking there's no meaningful advantage
to updating before polling.

Note, there is a functional change in addition to the success vs. fail
change.  The histogram updates previously called ktime_get() instead of
using "cur".  But that change is desirable as it means all the stats are
now updated with the same polling time, and avoids the extra ktime_get(),
which isn't expensive but isn't free either.
