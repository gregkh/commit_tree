dt-bindings: PCI: Add bindings for Brcmstb EP voltage regulators

Add bindings for Brcmstb EP voltage regulators.  A new mechanism is to be
added to the Linux PCI subsystem that will allocate and turn on/off
regulators.  These are standard regulators -- vpcie12v, vpcie3v3, and
vpcie3v3aux -- placed in the DT in the bridge node under the host bridge
device.

The use of a regulator property in the PCIe EP subnode such as
"vpcie12v-supply" depends on a pending pullreq to the pci-bus.yaml
file at
