can: xilinx_can: xcan_probe(): check for error irq

For the possible failure of the platform_get_irq(), the returned irq
could be error number and will finally cause the failure of the
request_irq().

Consider that platform_get_irq() can now in certain cases return
-EPROBE_DEFER, and the consequences of letting request_irq()
effectively convert that into -EINVAL, even at probe time rather than
later on. So it might be better to check just now.
