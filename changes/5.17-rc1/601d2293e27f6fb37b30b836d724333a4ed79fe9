intersil: Use struct_group() for memcpy() region

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally writing across neighboring fields.

Use struct_group() in struct hfa384x_tx_frame around members
frame_control, duration_id, addr1, addr2, addr3, and seq_ctrl, so they
can be referenced together. This will allow memcpy() and sizeof() to
more easily reason about sizes, improve readability, and avoid future
warnings about writing beyond the end of frame_control.

"pahole" shows no size nor member offset changes to struct
hfa384x_tx_frame. "objdump -d" shows no object code changes.
