nvme: increment request genctr on completion

The nvme request generation counter is intended to catch duplicate
completions. Incrementing the counter on submission means duplicates can
only be caught if the request tag is reallocated and dispatched prior to
the driver observing the corrupted CQE. Incrementing on completion
removes this window, making it possible to detect duplicate completions
in consecutive entries.
