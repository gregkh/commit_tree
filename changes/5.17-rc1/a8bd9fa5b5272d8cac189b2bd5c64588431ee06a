net: ocelot: remove "bridge" argument from ocelot_get_bridge_fwd_mask

The only called takes ocelot_port->bridge and passes it as the "bridge"
argument to this function, which then compares it with
ocelot_port->bridge. This is not useful.

Instead, we would like this function to return 0 if ocelot_port->bridge
is not present, which is what this patch does.
