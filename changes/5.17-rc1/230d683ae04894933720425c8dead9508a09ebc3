media: hantro: Hook up RK3399 JPEG encoder output

The JPEG encoder found in the Hantro H1 encoder block only produces a
raw entropy-encoded scan. The driver is responsible for building a JPEG
compliant bitstream and placing the entropy-encoded scan in it. Right
now the driver uses a bounce buffer for the hardware to output the raw
scan to.

In commit e765dba11ec2 ("hantro: Move hantro_enc_buf_finish to JPEG
codec_ops.done"), the code that copies the raw scan from the bounce
buffer to the capture buffer was moved, but was only hooked up for the
Hantro H1 (then RK3288) variant. The RK3399 variant was broken,
producing a JPEG bitstream without the scan, and the capture buffer's
.bytesused field unset.

Fix this by duplicating the code that is executed when the JPEG encoder
finishes encoding a frame. As the encoded length is read back from
hardware, and the variants having different register layouts, the
code is duplicated rather than shared.
