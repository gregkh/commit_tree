staging: r8188eu: remove rf_type from struct hal_data_8188e

The field rf_type of struct hal_data_8188e is set to RF_1T1R and
never changed. Also it is used only in a call to netdev_dbg() which
is not very useful since RTL8188EU chips are always 1T1R. Remove
the netdev_dbg() and remove rf_type from the hal_data_8188e
structure.
