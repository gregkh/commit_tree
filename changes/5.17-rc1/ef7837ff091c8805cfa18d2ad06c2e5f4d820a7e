drm/msm/dp: Add DP controllers for sc7280

The eDP controller on SC7280 is similar to the eDP/DP controllers
supported by the current driver implementation.

SC7280 supports one EDP and one DP controller which can operate
concurrently.

This change adds the support for eDP and DP controller on sc7280.
