net: dsa: support use of phylink_generic_validate()

Support the use of phylink_generic_validate() when there is no
phylink_validate method given in the DSA switch operations and
mac_capabilities have been set in the phylink_config structure by the
DSA switch driver.

This gives DSA switch drivers the option to use this if they provide
the supported_interfaces and mac_capabilities, while still giving them
an option to override the default implementation if necessary.
