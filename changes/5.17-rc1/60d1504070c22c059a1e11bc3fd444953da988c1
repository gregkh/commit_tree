perf/arm-cmn: Support new IP features

The second generation of CMN IPs add new node types and significantly
expand the configuration space with options for extra device ports on
edge XPs, either plumbed into the regular DTM or with extra dedicated
DTMs to monitor them, plus larger (and smaller) mesh sizes. Add basic
support for pulling this new information out of the hardware, piping
it around as necessary, and handling (most of) the new choices.
