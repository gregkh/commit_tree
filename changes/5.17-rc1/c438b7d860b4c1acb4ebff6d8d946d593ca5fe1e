tools/memory-model: litmus: Add two tests for unlock(A)+lock(B) ordering

The memory model has been updated to provide a stronger ordering
guarantee for unlock(A)+lock(B) on the same CPU/thread. Therefore add
two litmus tests describing this new guarantee, these tests are simple
yet can clearly show the usage of the new guarantee, also they can serve
as the self tests for the modification in the model.
