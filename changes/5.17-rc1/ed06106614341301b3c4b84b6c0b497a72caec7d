rtc: rs5c372: fix incorrect oscillation value on r2221tl

The XSL bit only exists in RS5C372A/B. On other Ricoh RTC chips
supported in rs5c372, this bit has different meaning. For example, on
R2221x and R2223x, this bit of oscillation adjustment register
determines the operation frequency of oscillation adjustment circuit and
the oscillation is always 32768HZ. But rs5c372_get_trim gives 32000HZ to
osc when DEV is 1.
