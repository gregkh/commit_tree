doc: Remove obsolete kernel-per-CPU-kthreads RCU_FAST_NO_HZ advice

This document advises building with both CONFIG_NO_HZ=y and
CONFIG_RCU_FAST_NO_HZ=y.  However, CONFIG_NO_HZ=y offloads callbacks from
all nohz_full CPUs, and CPUs with offloaded callbacks do not benefit from
CONFIG_RCU_FAST_NO_HZ=y.  Quite the opposite: CONFIG_RCU_FAST_NO_HZ=y
simply adds a bit of idle entry/exit overhead.

This commit therefore changes that advice to only CONFIG_NO_HZ=y.
