skbuff: Move conditional preprocessor directives out of struct sk_buff

In preparation for using the struct_group() macro in struct sk_buff,
move the conditional preprocessor directives out of the region of struct
sk_buff that will be enclosed by struct_group(). While GCC and Clang are
happy with conditional preprocessor directives here, sparse is not, even
under -Wno-directive-within-macro[1], as would be seen under a C=1 build:

net/core/filter.c: note: in included file (through include/linux/netlink.h, include/linux/sock_diag.h):
./include/linux/skbuff.h:820:1: warning: directive in macro's argument list
./include/linux/skbuff.h:822:1: warning: directive in macro's argument list
./include/linux/skbuff.h:846:1: warning: directive in macro's argument list
./include/linux/skbuff.h:848:1: warning: directive in macro's argument list

Additionally remove empty macro argument definitions and usage.

"objdump -d" shows no object code differences.
