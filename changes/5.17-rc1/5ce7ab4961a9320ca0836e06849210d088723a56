af_unix: Remove UNIX_ABSTRACT() macro and test sun_path[0] instead.

In BSD and abstract address cases, we store sockets in the hash table with
keys between 0 and UNIX_HASH_SIZE - 1.  However, the hash saved in a socket
varies depending on its address type; sockets with BSD addresses always
have UNIX_HASH_SIZE in their unix_sk(sk)->addr->hash.

This is just for the UNIX_ABSTRACT() macro used to check the address type.
The difference of the saved hashes comes from the first byte of the address
in the first place.  So, we can test it directly.

Then we can keep a real hash in each socket and replace unix_table_lock
with per-hash locks in the later patch.
