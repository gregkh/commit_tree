iw_cxgb4: Use memset_startat() for cpl_t5_pass_accept_rpl

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memset(), avoid intentionally writing across
neighboring fields.

Use memset_startat() so memset() doesn't get confused about writing beyond
the destination member that is intended to be the starting point of
zeroing through the end of the struct. Additionally, since everything
appears to perform a roundup (including allocation), just change the size
of the struct itself and add a build-time check to validate the expected
size.
