btrfs: remove useless condition check before splitting leaf

When inserting a key, we check if the write_lock_level is less than 1,
and if so we set it to 1, release the path and retry the tree traversal.

However that is unnecessary, because when ins_len is greater than 0, we
know that write_lock_level can never be less than 1.

The logic to retry is also buggy, because in case ins_len was decremented,
due to an exact key match and the search is not meant for item extension
(path->search_for_extension is 0), we retry without incrementing ins_len,
which would make the next retry decrement it again by the same amount.

So remove the check for write_lock_level being less than 1 and add an
assertion to assert it's always >= 1.
