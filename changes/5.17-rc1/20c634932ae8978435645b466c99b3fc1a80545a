scsi: hisi_sas: Prevent parallel controller reset and control phy command

A user may issue a control phy command from sysfs at any time, even if the
controller is resetting.

If a phy is disabled by hardreset/linkreset command before calling
get_phys_state() in the reset path, the saved phy state may be incorrect.

To avoid incorrectly recording the phy state, use hisi_hba.sem to ensure
that the controller reset may not run at the same time as when the phy
control function is running.
