lockd: move lockd_start_svc() call into lockd_create_svc()

lockd_start_svc() only needs to be called once, just after the svc is
created.  If the start fails, the svc is discarded too.

It thus makes sense to call lockd_start_svc() from lockd_create_svc().
This allows us to remove the test against nlmsvc_rqst at the start of
lockd_start_svc() - it must always be NULL.

lockd_up() only held an extra reference on the svc until a thread was
created - then it dropped it.  The thread - and thus the extra reference
- will remain until kthread_stop() is called.
Now that the thread is created in lockd_create_svc(), the extra
reference can be dropped there.  So the 'serv' variable is no longer
needed in lockd_up().
