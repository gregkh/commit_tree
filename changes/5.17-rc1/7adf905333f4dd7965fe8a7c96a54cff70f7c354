net: bna: Update supported link modes

The BR-series installation guide from https://driverdownloads.qlogic.com/
mentions the cards support 10Gbase-SR/LR as well as direct attach cables.

The cards only have SFP+ ports, so 10000baseT is not the right mode.
Switch to using more specific link modes added in commit 5711a98221443
("net: ethtool: add support for 1000BaseX and missing 10G link modes").

Only compile tested.
