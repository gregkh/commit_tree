habanalabs: keep control device alive during hard reset

Need to allow user retrieve data during reset and afterwards without
the need to reopen the device.
Did it by seperating the user peocesses list into two lists:
1. fpriv_list which contains list of user processes that opened
   the device (currently only one).
2. fpriv_ctrl_list which contains list of user processes that opened
   the control device. This processes in this list shall not be
   killed during reset, only when the device is suddenly removed from
   PCI chain.
