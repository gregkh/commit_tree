bpf: Fix out of bounds access for ringbuf helpers

Both bpf_ringbuf_submit() and bpf_ringbuf_discard() have ARG_PTR_TO_ALLOC_MEM
in their bpf_func_proto definition as their first argument. They both expect
the result from a prior bpf_ringbuf_reserve() call which has a return type of
RET_PTR_TO_ALLOC_MEM_OR_NULL.

Meaning, after a NULL check in the code, the verifier will promote the register
type in the non-NULL branch to a PTR_TO_MEM and in the NULL branch to a known
zero scalar. Generally, pointer arithmetic on PTR_TO_MEM is allowed, so the
latter could have an offset.

The ARG_PTR_TO_ALLOC_MEM expects a PTR_TO_MEM register type. However, the non-
zero result from bpf_ringbuf_reserve() must be fed into either bpf_ringbuf_submit()
or bpf_ringbuf_discard() but with the original offset given it will then read
out the struct bpf_ringbuf_hdr mapping.

The verifier missed to enforce a zero offset, so that out of bounds access
can be triggered which could be used to escalate privileges if unprivileged
BPF was enabled (disabled by default in kernel).
