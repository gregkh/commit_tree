arm64: dts: qcom: apq8096-db820c: correct lvs1 and lvs2 supply property

The qcom_rpm_smd_regulator driver uses vdd_lvs1_2-supply property to
specify the supply regulator for LVS1 and LVS2 (following the pin name
in the PMIC datasheet). Correct the board's device tree property, so
that the regulator supply is setup properly.
