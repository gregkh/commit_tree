pinctrl: samsung: Make symbol 'exynos7885_pin_ctrl' static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/pinctrl/samsung/pinctrl-exynos-arm64.c:490:31: warning:
 symbol 'exynos7885_pin_ctrl' was not declared. Should it be static?

This symbol is not used outside of pinctrl-exynos-arm64.c, so marks
it static.
