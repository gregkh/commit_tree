RDMA/rtrs-clt: Rename rtrs_clt_sess to rtrs_clt_path

rtrs_clt_sess is used for paths and not sessions on the client side. This
creates confusion so let's rename it to rtrs_clt_path. Also, rename
related variables and functions.

Coccinelle is used to do the transformations for most of the occurrences
and remaining ones were handled manually.
