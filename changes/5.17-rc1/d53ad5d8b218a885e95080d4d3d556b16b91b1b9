xdp: Move conversion to xdp_frame out of map functions

All map redirect functions except XSK maps convert xdp_buff to xdp_frame
before enqueueing it. So move this conversion of out the map functions
and into xdp_do_redirect(). This removes a bit of duplicated code, but more
importantly it makes it possible to support caller-allocated xdp_frame
structures, which will be added in a subsequent commit.
