memcg: better bounds on the memcg stats updates

Commit 11192d9c124d ("memcg: flush stats only if updated") added
tracking of memcg stats updates which is used by the readers to flush
only if the updates are over a certain threshold.  However each
individual update can correspond to a large value change for a given
stat.  For example adding or removing a hugepage to an LRU changes the
stat by thp_nr_pages (512 on x86_64).

Treating the update related to THP as one can keep the stat off, in
theory, by (thp_nr_pages * nr_cpus * CHARGE_BATCH) before flush.

To handle such scenarios, this patch adds consideration of the stat
update value as well instead of just the update event.  In addition let
the asyn flusher unconditionally flush the stats to put time limit on
the stats skew and hopefully a lot less readers would need to flush.
