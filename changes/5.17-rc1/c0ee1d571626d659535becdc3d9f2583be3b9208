HID: hid-input: Add suffix also for HID_DG_PEN

This and HID_DG_STYLUS are pretty much the same thing so add suffix for
HID_DG_PEN too. This makes the input device name look better.

While doing this, remove the suffix override from hid-multitouch, as it
is now handled by hid-input. Also, the suffix override done by
hid-multitouch was wrong, as it mapped HID_DG_PEN => "Stylus" and
HID_DG_STYLUS => "Pen".
