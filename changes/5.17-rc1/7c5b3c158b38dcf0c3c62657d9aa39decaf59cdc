i2c: designware: Enable async suspend / resume of designware devices

Mark the designware devices for asynchronous suspend. With this, the
resume for designware devices does not get stuck behind other unrelated
devices (e.g. intel_backlight that takes hundreds of ms to resume,
waiting for its parent devices).
