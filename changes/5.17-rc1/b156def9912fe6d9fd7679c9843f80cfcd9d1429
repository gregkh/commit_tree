drm/i915/fbc: Disable FBC fully on FIFO underrun

Currently a FIFO underrun just causes FBC to be deactivated,
and later checks then prevent it from being reactivated. We
can simpify our lives a bit by logically disabling FBC on
FIFO underruns. This avoids the funny intermediate state where
FBC is logically enabled but can't actually be activated.

v2: intel_wait_for_vblank() is no more
