selftests/powerpc: Add a test of sigreturning to the kernel

We have a general signal fuzzer, sigfuz, which can modify the MSR & NIP
before sigreturn. But the chance of it hitting a kernel address and also
clearing MSR_PR is fairly slim.

So add a specific test of sigreturn to a kernel address, both with and
without attempting to clear MSR_PR (which the kernel must block).
