block: remove GENHD_FL_EXT_DEVT

All modern drivers can support extra partitions using the extended
dev_t.  In fact except for the ioctl method drivers never even see
partitions in normal operation.

So remove the GENHD_FL_EXT_DEVT and allow extra partitions for all
block devices that do support partitions, and require those that
do not support partitions to explicit disallow them using
GENHD_FL_NO_PART.
