KVM: Integrate gfn_to_memslot_approx() into search_memslots()

s390 arch has gfn_to_memslot_approx() which is almost identical to
search_memslots(), differing only in that in case the gfn falls in a hole
one of the memslots bordering the hole is returned.

Add this lookup mode as an option to search_memslots() so we don't have two
almost identical functions for looking up a memslot by its gfn.
