crypto: qat - store the PFVF protocol version of the endpoints

This patch adds an entry for storing the PFVF protocol version for both
PF and VFs. While not currently used, knowing and storing the remote
protocol version enables more complex compatibility checks and/or newer
features for compatible PFVF endpoints in the future.
