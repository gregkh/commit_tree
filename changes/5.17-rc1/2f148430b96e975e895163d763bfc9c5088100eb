ASoC: SOF: Add a 'message' parameter to snd_sof_dsp_dbg_dump()

When snd_sof_dsp_dbg_dump() is called we have an explanatory message to
give some hint on the reason why we have the dump on the caller level.

Pass this message to snd_sof_dsp_dbg_dump() and handle the print according
to the dump rules.

This way we can finally print information on the HDA boot iteration if all
dumps are enabled.
