xdp: Allow registering memory model without rxq reference

The functions that register an XDP memory model take a struct xdp_rxq as
parameter, but the RXQ is not actually used for anything other than pulling
out the struct xdp_mem_info that it embeds. So refactor the register
functions and export variants that just take a pointer to the xdp_mem_info.

This is in preparation for enabling XDP_REDIRECT in bpf_prog_run(), using a
page_pool instance that is not connected to any network device.
