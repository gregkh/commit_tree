pcmcia: rsrc_nonstatic: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in nonstatic_find_mem_region()

In nonstatic_find_mem_region(), pcmcia_make_resource() is assigned to
res and used in pci_bus_alloc_resource(). There a dereference of res
in pci_bus_alloc_resource(), which could lead to a NULL pointer
dereference on failure of pcmcia_make_resource().

Fix this bug by adding a check of res.

This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
the callers, so they constitute bugs.

Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
the bug.

Builds with CONFIG_PCCARD_NONSTATIC=y show no new warnings,
and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.
