cachefiles: Add security derivation

Implement code to derive a new set of creds for the cachefiles to use when
making VFS or I/O calls and to change the auditing info since the
application interacting with the network filesystem is not accessing the
cache directly.  Cachefiles uses override_creds() to change the effective
creds temporarily.

set_security_override_from_ctx() is called to derive the LSM 'label' that
the cachefiles driver will act with.  set_create_files_as() is called to
determine the LSM 'label' that will be applied to files and directories
created in the cache.  These functions alter the new creds.

Also implement a couple of functions to wrap the calls to begin/end cred
overriding.
