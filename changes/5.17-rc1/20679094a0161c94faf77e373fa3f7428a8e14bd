RDMA/cma: Let cma_resolve_ib_dev() continue search even after empty entry

Currently, when cma_resolve_ib_dev() searches for a matching GID it will
stop searching after encountering the first empty GID table entry. This
behavior is wrong since neither IB nor RoCE spec enforce tightly packed
GID tables.

For example, when the matching valid GID entry exists at index N, and if a
GID entry is empty at index N-1, cma_resolve_ib_dev() will fail to find
the matching valid entry.

Fix it by making cma_resolve_ib_dev() continue searching even after
encountering missing entries.
