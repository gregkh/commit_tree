habanalabs: replace some -ENOTTY with -EINVAL

-ENOTTY is returned in case of error in the ioctl arguments themselves,
such as function that doesn't exists.

In all other cases, where the error is in the arguments of the custom
data structures that we define that are passed in the various ioctls,
we need to return -EINVAL.
