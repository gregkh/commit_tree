USB: ehci_brcm_hub_control: Improve port index sanitizing

Due to (wIndex & 0xff) - 1 can get an integer greater than 15, this
can cause array index to be out of bounds since the size of array
port_status is 15. This change prevents a possible out-of-bounds
pointer computation by forcing the use of a valid port number.
