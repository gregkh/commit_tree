kvm: x86: Exclude unpermitted xfeatures at KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID

KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID should not include any dynamic xstates in
CPUID[0xD] if they have not been requested with prctl. Otherwise
a process which directly passes KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID to
KVM_SET_CPUID2 would now fail even if it doesn't intend to use a
dynamically enabled feature. Userspace must know that prctl is
required and allocate >4K xstate buffer before setting any dynamic
bit.
