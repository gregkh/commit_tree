SUNRPC: always treat sv_nrpools==1 as "not pooled"

Currently 'pooled' services hold a reference on the pool_map, and
'unpooled' services do not.
svc_destroy() uses the presence of ->svo_function (via
svc_serv_is_pooled()) to determine if the reference should be dropped.
There is no direct correlation between being pooled and the use of
svo_function, though in practice, lockd is the only non-pooled service,
and the only one not to use svo_function.

This is untidy and would cause problems if we changed lockd to use
svc_set_num_threads(), which requires the use of ->svo_function.

So change the test for "is the service pooled" to "is sv_nrpools > 1".

This means that when svc_pool_map_get() returns 1, it must NOT take a
reference to the pool.

We discard svc_serv_is_pooled(), and test sv_nrpools directly.
