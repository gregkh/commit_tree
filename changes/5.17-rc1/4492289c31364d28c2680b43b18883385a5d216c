media: atomisp-ov2680: Fix ov2680_set_fmt() clobbering the exposure

Now that we restore the default or last user set exposure setting on
power_up() there is no need for the registers written by ov2680_set_fmt()
to write to the exposure register.

Not doing so fixes the exposure always being reset to the value from
the res->regs array after a set_fmt().
