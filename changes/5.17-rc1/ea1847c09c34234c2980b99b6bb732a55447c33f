arm64: dts: rockchip: Add spi1 pins on Quartz64 A

The Quartz64 Model A has the SPI pins broken out on its pin
header. The actual pins being used though are not the m0
variant, but the m1 variant, which also lacks the cs1 pin.

This commit overrides pinctrl-0 accordingly for this board.

spi1 is intentionally left disabled, as anyone wishing to add
SPI devices needs to edit the dts anyway, and the pins are more
useful as GPIOs for the rest of the users.
