KVM: s390: Ensure kvm_arch_no_poll() is read once when blocking vCPU

Wrap s390's halt_poll_max_steal with READ_ONCE and snapshot the result of
kvm_arch_no_poll() in kvm_vcpu_block() to avoid a mostly-theoretical,
largely benign bug on s390 where the result of kvm_arch_no_poll() could
change due to userspace modifying halt_poll_max_steal while the vCPU is
blocking.  The bug is largely benign as it will either cause KVM to skip
updating halt-polling times (no_poll toggles false=>true) or to update
halt-polling times with a slightly flawed block_ns.

Note, READ_ONCE is unnecessary in the current code, add it in case the
arch hook is ever inlined, and to provide a hint that userspace can
change the param at will.
