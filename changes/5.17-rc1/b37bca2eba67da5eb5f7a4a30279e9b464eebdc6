media: atomisp: make fw ver irci_stable_candrpv_0415_20150521_0458 work

This patch removes the unnamed struct `shading` from
`struct sh_css_sp_pipeline` as well as its usage [1].

[1] added on updating css version to irci_master_20150701_0213
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/ProductionKernelQuilts/cht-m1stable-2016_ww31/uefi/cht-m1stable/patches/cam-0439-atomisp2-css2401-and-2401_legacy-irci_master_2015070.patch
    ("atomisp2: css2401 and 2401_legacy-irci_master_20150701_0213")

This patch, together with the 4 patches applied before it revert incompatible
changes in the current css version for ISP2401 (irci_ecr-master_20150911_0724)
back to irci_stable_candrpv_0415_20150521_0458.

Some `struct`s are `sizeof()`ed in sh_css_firmware.c file. So, I guess
issues will happen if these sizes are changed. Therefore, keep them the
same as css version irci_stable_candrpv_0415_20150521_0458 to make atomisp
work for firmware made for such css version since we don't have firmware
made for the current css version.
