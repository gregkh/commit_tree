PCI/DPC: Use PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR() to check config reads

When config pci_ops.read() can detect failed PCI transactions, the data
returned to the CPU is PCI_ERROR_RESPONSE (~0 or 0xffffffff).

Obviously a successful PCI config read may *also* return that data if a
config register happens to contain ~0, so it doesn't definitively indicate
an error unless we know the register cannot contain ~0.

Use PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR() to check the response we get when we read data
from hardware.  This unifies PCI error response checking and makes error
checks consistent and easier to find.

Compile tested only.
