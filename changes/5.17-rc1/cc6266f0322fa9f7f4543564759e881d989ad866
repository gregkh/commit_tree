mm/dmapool.c: revert "make dma pool to use kmalloc_node"

This reverts commit 2618c60b8b5836 ("dma: make dma pool to use
kmalloc_node").

While working myself into the dmapool code I've found this little odd
kmalloc_node().

What basically happens here is that we allocate the housekeeping
structure on the numa node where the device is attached to.  Since the
device is never doing DMA to or from that memory this doesn't seem to
make sense at all.

So while this doesn't seem to cause much harm it's probably cleaner to
revert the change for consistency.
