mlxsw: spectrum_acl_bloom_filter: Rename Spectrum-2 specific objects for future use

Spectrum-4 will calculate hash function for bloom filter differently from
the existing ASICs.

There are two changes:
1. Instead of using one hash function to calculate 16 bits output (CRC-16),
   two functions will be used.
2. The chunks will be built differently, without padding.

As preparation for support of Spectrum-4 bloom filter, rename CRC table
to include "sp2" prefix and "crc16", as next patch will add two additional
tables. In addition, rename all the dedicated functions and defines for
Spectrum-{2,3} to include "sp2" prefix.
