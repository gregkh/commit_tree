IB/mthca: Use non-atomic bitmap functions when possible in 'mthca_mr.c'

In 'mthca_buddy_init()', the 'buddy->bits[n]' bitmap has just been
allocated, so no concurrent accesses can occur.

The other accesses to the 'buddy->bits[n]' bitmap are protected by the
'buddy->lock' spinlock, so no concurrent accesses can occur.

So prefer the non-atomic '__[set|clear]_bit()' functions to save a few
cycles.
