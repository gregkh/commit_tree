ASoC: SOF: sof-pci-dev: use community key on all Up boards

There are already 3 versions of the Up boards with support for the SOF
community key (ApolloLake, WhiskyLake, TigerLake). Rather than
continue to add quirks for each version, let's add a wildcard.

For WHL and TGL, the authentication supports both the SOF community
key and the firmware signed with the Intel production key. Given two
choices, the community key is the preferred option to allow developers
to sign their own firmware. The firmware signed with production key
can still be selected if needed with a kernel module
option (snd-sof-pci.fw_path="intel/sof")
