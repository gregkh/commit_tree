selftests: kvm/x86: Fix the warning in lib/x86_64/processor.c

The following warning appears when executing
make -C tools/testing/selftests/kvm

include/x86_64/processor.h:290:2: warning: 'ecx' may be used uninitialized in this
function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  asm volatile("cpuid"
  ^~~
lib/x86_64/processor.c:1523:21: note: 'ecx' was declared here
  uint32_t eax, ebx, ecx, edx, max_ext_leaf;

Just initialize ecx to remove this warning.
