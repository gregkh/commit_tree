dmaengine: xilinx_dpdma: stop using slave_id field

The display driver wants to pass a custom flag to the DMA engine driver,
which it started doing by using the slave_id field that was traditionally
used for a different purpose.

As there is no longer a correct use for the slave_id field, it should
really be removed, and the remaining users changed over to something
different.

The new mechanism for passing nonstandard settings is using the
.peripheral_config field, so use that to pass a newly defined structure
here, making it clear that this will not work in portable drivers.
