x86/ce4100: Replace "ti,pcf8575" by "nxp,pcf8575"

The TI part is equivalent to the NXP part, and its compatible value is
not documented in the DT bindings.

Note that while the Linux driver DT match table does not contain the
compatible value of the TI part, it could still match to this part, as
i2c_device_id-based matching ignores the vendor part of the compatible
value.
