interconnect: qcom: icc-rpmh: Add BCMs to commit list in pre_aggregate

We're only adding BCMs to the commit list in aggregate(), but there are
cases where pre_aggregate() is called without subsequently calling
aggregate(). In particular, in icc_sync_state() when a node with initial
BW has zero requests. Since BCMs aren't added to the commit list in
these cases, we don't actually send the zero BW request to HW. So the
resources remain on unnecessarily.

Add BCMs to the commit list in pre_aggregate() instead, which is always
called even when there are no requests.
