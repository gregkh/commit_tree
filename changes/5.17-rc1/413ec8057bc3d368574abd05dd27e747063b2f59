loop: remove redundant initialization of pointer node

The pointer node is being initialized with a value that is never
read, it is being re-assigned the same value a little futher on.
Remove the redundant initialization. Cleans up clang scan warning:

drivers/block/loop.c:823:19: warning: Value stored to 'node' during
its initialization is never read [deadcode.DeadStores]
