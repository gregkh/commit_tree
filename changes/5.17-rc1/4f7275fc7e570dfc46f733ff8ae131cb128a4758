i2c: i801: Don't clear status flags twice in interrupt mode

In interrupt mode we clear the status flags twice, in the interrupt
handler and in i801_check_post(). Remove clearing the status flags
from i801_check_post() and handle polling mode by using the
SMBus unlocking write to also clear the status flags if still set.
To be precise: One could still argue that the status flags are
cleared twice in interrupt mode, but it comes for free.
