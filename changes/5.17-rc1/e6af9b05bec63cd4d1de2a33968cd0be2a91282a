dmaengine: at_xdmac: Start transfer for cyclic channels in issue_pending

Cyclic channels must too call issue_pending in order to start a transfer.
Start the transfer in issue_pending regardless of the type of channel.
This wrongly worked before, because in the past the transfer was started
at tx_submit level when only a desc in the transfer list.
