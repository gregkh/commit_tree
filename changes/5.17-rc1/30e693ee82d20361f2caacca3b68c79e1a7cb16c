ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: correct default value

mt8195_cg_patch is used to reset the default value of audio cg, so the
register value could be consistent with CCF reference count.
Nevertheless, AUDIO_TOP_CON1[1:0] is used to control an internal mux,
and it's expected to keep the default value 0.

This patch corrects the default value in case an unexpected behavior
happens in the future.
