PCI: Convert pci_dev_present() stub to static inline

Change the pci_dev_present() stub which is used when CONFIG_PCI is not set
from a #define to a static inline stub.

Thix should fix clang -Werror builds failing due to errors like this:

  drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:4475:35:
   error: unused variable 'fwbug_cards_ids' [-Werror,-Wunused-const-variable]

Where fwbug_cards_ids is an array of pci_device_id passed to
pci_dev_present() during a quirk check.
