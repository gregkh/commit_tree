platform/x86: int3472: Add get_sensor_adev_and_name() helper

The discrete.c code is not the only code which needs to lookup the
acpi_device and device-name for the sensor for which the INT3472
ACPI-device is a GPIO/clk/regulator provider.

The tps68470.c code also needs this functionality, so factor this
out into a new get_sensor_adev_and_name() helper.
