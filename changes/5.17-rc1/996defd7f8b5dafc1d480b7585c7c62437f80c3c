net: axienet: Fix TX ring slot available check

The check for whether a TX ring slot was available was incorrect,
since a slot which had been loaded with transmit data but the device had
not started transmitting would be treated as available, potentially
causing non-transmitted slots to be overwritten. The control field in
the descriptor should be checked, rather than the status field (which may
only be updated when the device completes the entry).
