scsi: hisi_sas: Use autosuspend for the host controller

The controller may frequently enter and exit suspend for each I/O which we
need to deal with. This is inefficient and may cause too much suspend and
resume activity for the controller.  To avoid this, use a default 5s
autosuspend for the controller to stop frequently suspending and
resuming. This value may still be modified via sysfs interfaces.
