KMV: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Use set_dec to set decrementer to host

The host Linux timer code arms the decrementer with the value
'decrementers_next_tb - current_tb' using set_dec(), which stores
val - 1 on Book3S-64, which is not quite the same as what KVM does
to re-arm the host decrementer when exiting the guest.

This shouldn't be a significant change, but it makes the logic match
and avoids this small extra change being brought into the next patch.
