ASoC: Intel: add sof-nau8825 machine driver

The machine driver is a generic machine driver for SOF with nau8825
codec w or w/o speaker additionally. Depending on the SOC
HDMI, DMIC, Bluetooth offload support are added dynamically.

Only add information related to SOF since the machine driver was
only tested with SOF.

There are currently 4 i2s machine variants of ADL.
This supports the headphone NUA8825(SSP0) alone or with smart or dumb
speakers.
Board 2,3,4 use SSP2 for Bluetooth offload support except board 1.

Board 1 : NAU8825 + RT1019P(SSP2)
Board 2 : NAU8825 + MAX98373(SSP1)
Board 3 : NAU8825 + MAX98360A(SSP1)
