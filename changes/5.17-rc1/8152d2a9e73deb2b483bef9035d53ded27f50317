thermal/drivers/intel_powerclamp: Constify static thermal_cooling_device_ops

The only usage of powerclamp_cooling_ops is to pass its address to
thermal_cooling_device_register(), which takes a pointer to const struct
thermal_cooling_device_ops. Make it const to allow the compiler to put
it in read-only memory.
