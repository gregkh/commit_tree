ALSA: hda: ALC287: Add Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 9i 14ITL5 speaker quirk

The speaker fixup that is used for the Yoga 7 14ITL5 also applies to
the IdeaPad Slim 9i 14ITL5. The attached patch applies the quirk to
initialise the amplifier on the IdeaPad Slim 9i as well.

This is validated to work on my laptop.
