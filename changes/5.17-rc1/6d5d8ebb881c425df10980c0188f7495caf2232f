mlxsw: Rename virtual router flex key element

In Spectrum-4, the size of the virtual router ACL key element increased
from 11 bits to 12 bits.

In order to reuse the existing virtual router ACL key element
enumerators for Spectrum-4, rename 'VIRT_ROUTER_8_10' and
'VIRT_ROUTER_0_7' to 'VIRT_ROUTER_MSB' and 'VIRT_ROUTER_LSB',
respectively.

No functional changes intended.
