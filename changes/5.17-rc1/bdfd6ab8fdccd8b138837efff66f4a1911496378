gpiolib: acpi: Do not set the IRQ type if the IRQ is already in use

If the IRQ is already in use, then acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by() really
should not change the type underneath the current owner.

I specifically hit an issue with this an a Chuwi Hi8 Super (CWI509) Bay
Trail tablet, when the Boot OS selection in the BIOS is set to Android.
In this case _STA for a MAX17047 ACPI I2C device wrongly returns 0xf and
the _CRS resources for this device include a GpioInt pointing to a GPIO
already in use by an _AEI handler, with a different type then specified
in the _CRS for the MAX17047 device. Leading to the acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get()
call done by the i2c-core-acpi.c code changing the type breaking the
_AEI handler.

Now this clearly is a bug in the DSDT of this tablet (in Android mode),
but in general calling irq_set_irq_type() on an IRQ which already is
in use seems like a bad idea.
