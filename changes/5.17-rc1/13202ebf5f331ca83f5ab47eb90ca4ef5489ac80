scsi: sd_zbc: Simplify zone full condition check

According to the ZBC (and ZAC) specification, a zone that has Zone Type set
to Conventional, must also have its Zone Condition set to "Not Write
Pointer".

Therefore, a conventional zone will never have Zone Condition set to
"Full", which means that we can omit the non-conventional prerequisite from
the zone full condition check.
