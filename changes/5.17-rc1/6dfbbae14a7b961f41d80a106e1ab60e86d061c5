fs: proc: store PDE()->data into inode->i_private

PDE_DATA(inode) is introduced to get user private data and hide the
layout of struct proc_dir_entry.  The inode->i_private is used to do the
same thing as well.  Save a copy of user private data to inode->
i_private when proc inode is allocated.  This means the user also can
get their private data by inode->i_private.

Introduce pde_data() to wrap inode->i_private so that we can remove
PDE_DATA() from fs/proc/generic.c and make PTE_DATE() as a wrapper of
pde_data().  It will be easier if we decide to remove PDE_DATE() in the
future.
