ACPI: battery: Add the ThinkPad "Not Charging" quirk

The EC/ACPI firmware on Lenovo ThinkPads used to report a status
of "Unknown" when the battery is between the charge start and
charge stop thresholds. On Windows, it reports "Not Charging"
so the quirk has been added to also report correctly.

Now the "status" attribute returns "Not Charging" when the
battery on ThinkPads is not physicaly charging.
