spi: dw: Perform IRQ setup in a dedicated function

In order to make the transfer_one() callback method more readable and
for unification with the DMA-based transfer, let's detach the IRQ setup
procedure into a dedicated function. While at it rename the IRQ-based
transfer handler function to be dw_spi-prefixe and looking more like the
DMA-related one.
