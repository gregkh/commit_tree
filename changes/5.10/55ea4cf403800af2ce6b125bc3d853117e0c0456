ring-buffer: Update write stamp with the correct ts

The write stamp, used to calculate deltas between events, was updated with
the stale "ts" value in the "info" structure, and not with the updated "ts"
variable. This caused the deltas between events to be inaccurate, and when
crossing into a new sub buffer, had time go backwards.
