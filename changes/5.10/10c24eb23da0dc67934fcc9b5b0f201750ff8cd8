devlink: add parser error drop packet traps

Add parser error drop packet traps, so that capable device driver could
register them with devlink. The new packet trap group holds any drops of
packets which were marked by the device as erroneous during header
parsing. Add documentation for every added packet trap and packet trap
group.
