mm/debug_vm_pgtable/set_pte/pmd/pud: don't use set_*_at to update an existing pte entry

set_pte_at() should not be used to set a pte entry at locations that
already holds a valid pte entry.  Architectures like ppc64 don't do TLB
invalidate in set_pte_at() and hence expect it to be used to set locations
that are not a valid PTE.
