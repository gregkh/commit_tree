drm/i915: Unlock the shared hwsp_gtt object after pinning

The hwsp_gtt object is used for sub-allocation and could therefore
be shared by many contexts causing unnecessary contention during
concurrent context pinning.
However since we're currently locking it only for pinning, it remains
resident until we unpin it, and therefore it's safe to drop the
lock early, allowing for concurrent thread access.
