net: stmmac: Add option for VLAN filter fail queue enable

Add option in plat_stmmacenet_data struct to enable VLAN Filter Fail
Queuing. This option allows packets that fail VLAN filter to be routed
to a specific Rx queue when Receive All is also set.

When this option is enabled:
- Enable VFFQ only when entering promiscuous mode, because Receive All
  will pass up all rx packets that failed address filtering (similar to
  promiscuous mode).
- VLAN-promiscuous mode is never entered to allow rx packet to fail VLAN
  filters and get routed to selected VFFQ Rx queue.
