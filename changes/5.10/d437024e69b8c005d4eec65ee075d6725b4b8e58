mm/page_counter: correct the obsolete func name in the comment of page_counter_try_charge()

Since commit bbec2e15170a ("mm: rename page_counter's count/limit into
usage/max"), page_counter_limit() is renamed to page_counter_set_max().
So replace page_counter_limit with page_counter_set_max in comment.
