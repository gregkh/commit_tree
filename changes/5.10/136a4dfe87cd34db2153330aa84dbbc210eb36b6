ACPI: button: Drop no longer necessary Acer SW5-012 lid_init_state quirk

Commit 78a5b53e9fb4 ("Input: soc_button_array - work around DSDTs which
modify the irqflags") adds a workaround for DSDTs with a _LID method
which play tricks with the irqflags, assuming that the OS is using
an irq-type of IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW.

Now that this workaround is in place, we no longer need to disable the
lid functionality on the Acer SW5-012.
