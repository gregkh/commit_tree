virtio: let arch advertise guest's memory access restrictions

An architecture may restrict host access to guest memory,
e.g. IBM s390 Secure Execution or AMD SEV.

Provide a new Kconfig entry the architecture can select,
CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_RESTRICTED_VIRTIO_MEMORY_ACCESS, when it provides
the arch_has_restricted_virtio_memory_access callback to advertise
to VIRTIO common code when the architecture restricts memory access
from the host.

The common code can then fail the probe for any device where
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is required, but not set.
