mm/debug_vm_pgtable/savedwrite: enable savedwrite test with CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING

Saved write support was added to track the write bit of a pte after
marking the pte protnone.  This was done so that AUTONUMA can convert a
write pte to protnone and still track the old write bit.  When converting
it back we set the pte write bit correctly thereby avoiding a write fault
again.  Hence enable the test only when CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING is enabled
and use protnone protflags.
