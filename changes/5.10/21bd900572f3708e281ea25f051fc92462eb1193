mm: split swap_type_of

swap_type_of is used for two entirely different purposes:

 (1) check what swap type a given device/offset corresponds to
 (2) find the first available swap device that can be written to

Mixing both in a single function creates an unreadable mess.  Create two
separate functions instead, and switch both to pass a dev_t instead of
a struct block_device to further simplify the code.
