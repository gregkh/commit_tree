dmaengine: dmatest: Print error codes as signed value

When we got an error from DMA mapping API we convert a negative value
to unsigned long type and hence make user confused:

  result #1: 'src mapping error' with src_off=0x19a72 dst_off=0xea len=0xccf4 (18446744073709551604)

Change this to print error codes as signed values.
