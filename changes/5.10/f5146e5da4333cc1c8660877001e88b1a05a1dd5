ARM: dts: NSP: Fix SP805 clock-names

The SP805 binding sets the name for the actual watchdog clock to
"wdog_clk" (with an underscore).

Change the name in the DTs for the Broadcom NSP platform to match that.
The Linux and U-Boot driver use the *first* clock for this purpose
anyway, so it does not break anything.
