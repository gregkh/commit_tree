bpf: disallow attaching modify_return tracing functions to other BPF programs

From the checks and commit messages for modify_return, it seems it was
never the intention that it should be possible to attach a tracing program
with expected_attach_type == BPF_MODIFY_RETURN to another BPF program.
However, check_attach_modify_return() will only look at the function name,
so if the target function starts with "security_", the attach will be
allowed even for bpf2bpf attachment.

Fix this oversight by also blocking the modification if a target program is
supplied.
