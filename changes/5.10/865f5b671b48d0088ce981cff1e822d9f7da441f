can: m_can: m_can_open(): remove IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING from request_threaded_irq()'s flags

The threaded IRQ handler is used for the tcan4x5x driver only. The IRQ pin of
the tcan4x5x controller is active low, so better not use IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING
when requesting the IRQ. As this can result in missing interrupts.

Further, if the device tree specified the interrupt as "IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW",
unloading and reloading of the driver results in the following error during
ifup:

| irq: type mismatch, failed to map hwirq-31 for gpio@20a8000!
| tcan4x5x spi1.1: m_can device registered (irq=0, version=32)
| tcan4x5x spi1.1 can2: TCAN4X5X successfully initialized.
| tcan4x5x spi1.1 can2: failed to request interrupt

This patch fixes the problem by removing the IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING from the
request_threaded_irq().
