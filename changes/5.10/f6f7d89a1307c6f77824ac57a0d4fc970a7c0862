media: docs: v4l2-subdev: move calling ops to a subsection

Documentation on how to call the subdev ops is currently in the middle of
synchronous and asynchronous registration. Move it to a dedicated
subsection after the registration methods.

Also move the final paragraph "The advantage of using v4l2_subdev..." to
the beginning of the new section as it has an introductory content.
