tests: remove O_NONBLOCK before waiting for WSTOPPED

Naresh reported that selftests: pidfd: pidfd_wait hangs on linux next kernel on
x86_64, i386 and arm64 Juno-r2
These devices are using NFS mounted rootfs.
I have tested pidfd testcases independently and all test PASS.

The Hang or exit from test run noticed when run by run_kselftest.sh

pidfd_wait.c:208:wait_nonblock:Expected sys_waitid(P_PIDFD, pidfd,
&info, WSTOPPED, NULL) (-1) == 0 (0)
wait_nonblock: Test terminated by assertion

The reason for this is a simple race in the selftests, that I overlooked and
which is more likely to hit when there's a lot of processes running on the
system. Basically the child process hasn't SIGSTOPed itself yet but the parent
is already calling waitid() on a O_NONBLOCK pidfd. Since it doesn't find a
WSTOPPED process it returns -EAGAIN correctly.

The fix for this is to move the line where we're removing the O_NONBLOCK
property from the fd before the waitid() WSTOPPED call so we hang until the
child becomes stopped.
