RDMA/hns: Solve the overflow of the calc_pg_sz()

calc_pg_sz() may gets a data calculation overflow if the PAGE_SIZE is 64 KB
and hop_num is 2. It is because that all variables involved in calculation
are defined in type of int. So change the type of bt_chunk_size,
buf_chunk_size and obj_per_chunk_default to u64.
