wcn36xx: Define INIT_HAL_MSG_V1()

In order to pass 802.11ac VHT parameters from the SoC to wcn36xx we need to
use the V1 data structures associated with BSS and STA parameters.

The means of identifying a V1 data-structure is via the SMD version field.
This patch defines a INIT_HAL_MSG_V1() which operates the same way as
INIT_HAL_MSG() with the exception that it defines VERSION1 as opposed to
VERSION0.
