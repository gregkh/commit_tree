tracing: Save normal string variables

String variables created as field variables and save variables are
already handled properly by having their values copied when set.  The
same isn't done for normal variables, but needs to be - simply saving
a pointer to a string contained in an old event isn't sufficient,
since that event's data may quickly become overwritten and therefore a
string pointer to it could yield garbage.

This change uses the same mechanism as field variables and simply
appends the new strings to the existing per-element field_var_str[]
array allocated for that purpose.
