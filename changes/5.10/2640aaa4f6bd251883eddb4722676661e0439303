can: spi: Kconfig: remove unneeded dependencies form Kconfig symbols

Since commits

    653ee35ce6d5 ("can: hi311x: remove custom DMA mapped buffer")
    Fixes: df58525df395 ("can: mcp251x: remove custom DMA mapped buffer")

both the hi3111x and the mcp251x driver don't make use of the DMA API
any more. So we can safely remove the HAS_DMA dependency.

While we're here, remove the unneeded CAN_DEV and SPI dependencies from
the CAN_HI311X symbol, as the parent menus already have these
dependencies.
