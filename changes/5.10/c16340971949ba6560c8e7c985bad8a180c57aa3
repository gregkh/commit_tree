tracing/boot: Add ftrace.instance.*.alloc_snapshot option

Add ftrace.instance.*.alloc_snapshot option.

This option has been described in Documentation/trace/boottime-trace.rst
but not implemented yet.

ftrace.[instance.INSTANCE.]alloc_snapshot
   Allocate snapshot buffer.

The difference from kernel.alloc_snapshot is that the kernel.alloc_snapshot
will allocate the buffer only for the main instance, but this can allocate
buffer for any new instances.
