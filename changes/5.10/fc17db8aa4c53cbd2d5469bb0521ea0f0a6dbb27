perf/x86/intel: Check PEBS status correctly

The kernel cannot disambiguate when 2+ PEBS counters overflow at the
same time. This is what the comment for this code suggests.  However,
I see the comparison is done with the unfiltered p->status which is a
copy of IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS at the time of the sample. This
register contains more than the PEBS counter overflow bits. It also
includes many other bits which could also be set.
