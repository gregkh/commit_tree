x86/events/amd/iommu: Fix sizeof mismatch

An incorrect sizeof is being used, struct attribute ** is not correct,
it should be struct attribute *. Note that since ** is the same size as
* this is not causing any issues.  Improve this fix by using sizeof(*attrs)
as this allows us to not even reference the type of the pointer.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Sizeof not portable (SIZEOF_MISMATCH)")
