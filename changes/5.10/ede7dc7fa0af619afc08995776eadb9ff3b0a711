jbd2: rename j_maxlen to j_total_len and add jbd2_journal_max_txn_bufs

The on-disk superblock field sb->s_maxlen represents the total size of
the journal including the fast commit area and is no more the max
number of blocks available for a transaction. The maximum number of
blocks available to a transaction is reduced by the number of fast
commit blocks. So, this patch renames j_maxlen to j_total_len to
better represent its intent. Also, it adds a function to calculate max
number of bufs available for a transaction.
