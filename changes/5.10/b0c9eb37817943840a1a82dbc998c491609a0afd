bpf: Make bpf_link_info.iter similar to bpf_iter_link_info

bpf_link_info.iter is used by link_query to return bpf_iter_link_info
to user space. Fields may be different, e.g., map_fd vs. map_id, so
we cannot reuse the exact structure. But make them similar, e.g.,

  struct bpf_link_info {
     /* common fields */
     union {
	struct { ... } raw_tracepoint;
	struct { ... } tracing;
	...
	struct {
	    /* common fields for iter */
	    union {
		struct {
		    __u32 map_id;
		} map;
		/* other structs for other targets */
	    };
	};
    };
 };

so the structure is extensible the same way as bpf_iter_link_info.
