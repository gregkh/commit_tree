iio:chemical:sgp30: Drop of_match_ptr and use generic fw accessors

This change allow the driver to be used with ACPI PRP0001 and removes
an antipattern that I want to avoid being copied into new IIO drivers.

The handling of match_data uses a different approach as
device_get_match_data doesn't distinguish between no match, and
a match but with NULL data.
