USB: serial: cyberjack: fix write-URB completion race

The write-URB busy flag was being cleared before the completion handler
was done with the URB, something which could lead to corrupt transfers
due to a racing write request if the URB is resubmitted.

Fixes: 507ca9bc0476 ("[PATCH] USB: add ability for usb-serial drivers to determine if their write urb is currently being used.")
