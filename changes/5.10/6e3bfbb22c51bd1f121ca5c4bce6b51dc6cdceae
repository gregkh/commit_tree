KVM: arm64: nVHE: Use separate vector for the host

The host is treated differently from the guests when an exception is
taken so introduce a separate vector that is specialized for the host.
This also allows the nVHE specific code to move out of hyp-entry.S and
into nvhe/host.S.

The host is only expected to make HVC calls and anything else is
considered invalid and results in a panic.

Hyp initialization is now passed the vector that is used for the host
and it is swapped for the guest vector during the context switch.
