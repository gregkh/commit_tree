btrfs: simplify metadata pages reading

Metadata pages currently use __do_readpage to read metadata pages,
unfortunately this function is also used to deal with ordinary data
pages. This makes the metadata pages reading code to go through multiple
hoops in order to adhere to __do_readpage invariants. Most of these are
necessary for data pages which could be compressed. For metadata it's
enough to simply build a bio and submit it.

To this effect simply call submit_extent_page directly from
read_extent_buffer_pages which is the only callpath used to populate
extent_buffers with data. This in turn enables further cleanups.
