gpiolib: cdev: switch from kstrdup() to kstrndup()

Use kstrndup() to copy line labels from the userspace provided char
array, rather than ensuring the char array contains a null terminator
and using kstrdup().

Note that the length provided to kstrndup() still assumes that the char
array does contain a null terminator, so the maximum string length is one
less than the array.  This is consistent with the previous behaviour.
