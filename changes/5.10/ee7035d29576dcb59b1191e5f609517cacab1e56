scftorture: Prevent compiler from reducing race probabilities

Detecting smp_call_function() memory misordering requires close timing,
so it is necessary to have the checks immediately before and after
the call to the smp_call_function*() function under test.  This commit
therefore inserts barrier() calls to prevent the compiler from optimizing
memory-misordering detection down into the zone of extreme improbability.
