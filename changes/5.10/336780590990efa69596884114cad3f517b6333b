irqchip/gic-v3: Support pseudo-NMIs when SCR_EL3.FIQ == 0

The GIC's internal view of the priority mask register and the assigned
interrupt priorities are based on whether GIC security is enabled and
whether firmware routes Group 0 interrupts to EL3. At the moment, we
support priority masking when ICC_PMR_EL1 and interrupt priorities are
either both modified by the GIC, or both left unchanged.

Trusted Firmware-A's default interrupt routing model allows Group 0
interrupts to be delivered to the non-secure world (SCR_EL3.FIQ == 0).
Unfortunately, this is precisely the case that the GIC driver doesn't
support: ICC_PMR_EL1 remains unchanged, but the GIC's view of interrupt
priorities is different from the software programmed values.

Support pseudo-NMIs when SCR_EL3.FIQ == 0 by using a different value to
mask regular interrupts. All the other values remain the same.
