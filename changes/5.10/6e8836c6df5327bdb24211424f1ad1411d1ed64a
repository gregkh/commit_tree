coresight: cti: remove pm_runtime_get_sync() from CPU hotplug

Below BUG is triggered by call pm_runtime_get_sync() in
cti_cpuhp_enable_hw(). It's in CPU hotplug callback with interrupt
disabled. Pm_runtime_get_sync() calls clock driver to enable clock
which could sleep. Remove pm_runtime_get_sync() in cti_cpuhp_enable_hw()
since pm_runtime_get_sync() is called in cti_enabld and pm_runtime_put()
is called in cti_disabled. No need to increase pm count when CPU gets
online since it's not decreased when CPU is offline.
