net: hns3: add a check for device specifications queried from firmware

The device specifications querying is unsupported by the old
firmware, in this case, these specifications are 0. However,
some specifications should not be 0 or will cause problem.

So after querying from firmware, some device specifications
are needed to check their value and set to default value if
their values are 0.
