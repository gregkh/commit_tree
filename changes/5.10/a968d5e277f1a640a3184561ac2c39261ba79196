bpf: Move the PTR_TO_BTF_ID check to check_reg_type()

check_reg_type() checks whether a reg can be used as an arg of a
func_proto.  For PTR_TO_BTF_ID, the check is actually not
completely done until the reg->btf_id is pointing to a
kernel struct that is acceptable by the func_proto.

Thus, this patch moves the btf_id check into check_reg_type().
"arg_type" and "arg_btf_id" are passed to check_reg_type() instead of
"compatible".  The compatible_reg_types[] usage is localized in
check_reg_type() now.

The "if (!btf_id) verbose(...); " is also removed since it won't happen.
