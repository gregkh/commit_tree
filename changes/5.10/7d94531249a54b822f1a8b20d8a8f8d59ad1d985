kvm: x86/mmu: Remove disallowed_hugepage_adjust shadow_walk_iterator arg

In order to avoid creating executable hugepages in the TDP MMU PF
handler, remove the dependency between disallowed_hugepage_adjust and
the shadow_walk_iterator. This will open the function up to being used
by the TDP MMU PF handler in a future patch.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.
