drm/rockchip: Avoid uninitialized use of endpoint id in LVDS

In the Rockchip DRM LVDS component driver, the endpoint id provided to
drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge is grabbed from the endpoint's reg property.

However, the property may be missing in the case of a single endpoint.
Initialize the endpoint_id variable to 0 to avoid using an
uninitialized variable in that case.
