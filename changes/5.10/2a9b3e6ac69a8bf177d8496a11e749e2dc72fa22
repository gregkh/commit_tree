arm64: entry: fix EL1 debug transitions

In debug_exception_enter() and debug_exception_exit() we trace hardirqs
on/off while RCU isn't guaranteed to be watching, and we don't save and
restore the hardirq state, and so may return with this having changed.

Handle this appropriately with new entry/exit helpers which do the bare
minimum to ensure this is appropriately maintained, without marking
debug exceptions as NMIs. These are placed in entry-common.c with the
other entry/exit helpers.

In future we'll want to reconsider whether some debug exceptions should
be NMIs, but this will require a significant refactoring, and for now
this should prevent issues with lockdep and RCU.
