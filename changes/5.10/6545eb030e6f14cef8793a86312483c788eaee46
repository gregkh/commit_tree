objtool: Move object file loading out of check()

Structure objtool_file can be used by different subcommands. In fact
it already is, by check and orc.

Provide a function that allows to initialize objtool_file, that builtin
can call, without relying on check to do the correct setup for them and
explicitly hand the objtool_file to them.
