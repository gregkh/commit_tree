arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Fix MDP/DSI interrupts

The mdss node sets #interrupt-cells = <1>, so its interrupts
should be referenced using a single cell (in this case: only the
interrupt number).

However, right now the mdp/dsi node both have two interrupt cells
set, e.g. interrupts = <4 0>. The 0 is probably meant to say
IRQ_TYPE_NONE (= 0), but with #interrupt-cells = <1> this is
actually interpreted as a second interrupt line.

Remove the IRQ flags from both interrupts to fix this.
