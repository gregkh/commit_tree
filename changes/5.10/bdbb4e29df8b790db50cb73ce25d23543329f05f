netlink: add mask validation

We don't have good validation policy for existing unsigned int attrs
which serve as flags (for new ones we could use NLA_BITFIELD32).
With increased use of policy dumping having the validation be
expressed as part of the policy is important. Add validation
policy in form of a mask of supported/valid bits.

Support u64 in the uAPI to be future-proof, but really for now
the embedded mask member can only hold 32 bits, so anything with
bit 32+ set will always fail validation.
