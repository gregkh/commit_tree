gfs2: don't initialize statfs_change inodes in spectator mode

Before commit 97fd734ba17e, the local statfs_changeX inode was never
initialized for spectator mounts. However, it still checks for
spectator mounts when unmounting everything. There's no good reason to
lookup the statfs_changeX files because spectators cannot perform recovery.
It still, however, needs the master statfs file for statfs calls.
This patch adds the check for spectator mounts to init_statfs.

Fixes: 97fd734ba17e ("gfs2: lookup local statfs inodes prior to journal recovery")
