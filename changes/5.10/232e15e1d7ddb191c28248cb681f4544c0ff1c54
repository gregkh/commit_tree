net: xgene: Move shared header file into include/linux

This header file is currently included into the ethernet driver via a
relative path into the PHY subsystem. This is bad practice, and causes
issues for the upcoming move of the MDIO driver. Move the header file
into include/linux to clean this up.

v2:
Move header to include/linux/mdio
