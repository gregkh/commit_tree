perf record: Synthesize cgroup events only if needed

It didn't check the tool->cgroup_events bit which is set when the
--all-cgroups option is given.  Without it, samples will not have cgroup
info so no reason to synthesize.

We can check the PERF_RECORD_CGROUP records after running perf record
*WITHOUT* the --all-cgroups option:

Before:

  $ perf report -D | grep CGROUP
  0 0 0x8430 [0x38]: PERF_RECORD_CGROUP cgroup: 1 /
          CGROUP events:          1
          CGROUP events:          0
          CGROUP events:          0

After:

  $ perf report -D | grep CGROUP
          CGROUP events:          0
          CGROUP events:          0
          CGROUP events:          0

Committer testing:

Before:

  # perf record -a sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 2.208 MB perf.data (10003 samples) ]
  # perf report -D | grep "CGROUP events"
            CGROUP events:        146
            CGROUP events:          0
            CGROUP events:          0
  #

After:

  # perf record -a sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 2.208 MB perf.data (10448 samples) ]
  # perf report -D | grep "CGROUP events"
            CGROUP events:          0
            CGROUP events:          0
            CGROUP events:          0
  #

With all-cgroups:

  # perf record --all-cgroups -a sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 2.374 MB perf.data (11526 samples) ]
  # perf report -D | grep "CGROUP events"
            CGROUP events:        146
            CGROUP events:          0
            CGROUP events:          0
