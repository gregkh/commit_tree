x86/boot: Add .text.* to setup.ld

GCC puts the main function into .text.startup when compiled with -Os (or
-O2). This results in arch/x86/boot/main.c having a .text.startup
section which is currently not included explicitly in the linker script
setup.ld in the same directory.

The BFD linker places this orphan section immediately after .text, so
this still works. However, LLD git, since [1], is choosing to place it
immediately after the .bstext section instead (this is the first code
section). This plays havoc with the section layout that setup.elf
requires to create the setup header, for eg on 64-bit:

    LD      arch/x86/boot/setup.elf

Add .text.* to the .text output section to fix this, and also prevent
any future surprises if the compiler decides to create other such
sections.
