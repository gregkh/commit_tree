cpufreq: Introduce governor flags

A new cpufreq governor flag will be added subsequently, so replace
the bool dynamic_switching fleid in struct cpufreq_governor with a
flags field and introduce CPUFREQ_GOV_DYNAMIC_SWITCHING to set for
the "dynamic switching" governors instead of it.

No intentional functional impact.
