io_uring: use blk_queue_nowait() to check if NOWAIT supported

commit 021a24460dc2 ("block: add QUEUE_FLAG_NOWAIT") adds a new helper
function blk_queue_nowait() to check if the bdev supports handling of
REQ_NOWAIT or not. Since then bio-based dm device can also support
REQ_NOWAIT, and currently only dm-linear supports that since
commit 6abc49468eea ("dm: add support for REQ_NOWAIT and enable it for
linear target").
