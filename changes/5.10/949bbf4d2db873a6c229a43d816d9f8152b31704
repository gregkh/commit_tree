s390/qeth: allow configuration of TX queues for OSA devices

For OSA devices that are _not_ configured in prio-queue mode, give users
the option of selecting the number of active TX queues.
This requires setting up the HW queues with a reasonable default QoS
value in the QIB's PQUE parm area.

As with the other device types, we bring up the device with a minimal
number of TX queues for compatibility reasons.
