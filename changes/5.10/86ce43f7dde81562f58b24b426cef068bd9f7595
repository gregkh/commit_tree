x86/boot/compressed/64: Check SEV encryption in 64-bit boot-path

Check whether the hypervisor reported the correct C-bit when running as
an SEV guest. Using a wrong C-bit position could be used to leak
sensitive data from the guest to the hypervisor.

The check function is in a separate file:

  arch/x86/kernel/sev_verify_cbit.S

so that it can be re-used in the running kernel image.
