docs: sound: writing-an-alsa-driver.rst: get rid of :c:type

the :c:type shouldn't be used with structs with Sphinx 3,
as the C domain there uses .. c:struct for structs.

As we have the automarkup extension, let's just get rid of
all :c:type as a whole, as those will be automagically
marked as such.

This solves a bunch of warnings with Sphinx 3, like those:

	.../Documentation/sound/kernel-api/writing-an-alsa-driver.rst:490: WARNING: Unparseable C cross-reference: 'calling snd_card_free'
