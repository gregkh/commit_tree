KVM: selftests: Simplify demand_paging_test with timespec_diff_now

Add a helper function to get the current time and return the time since
a given start time. Use that function to simplify the timekeeping in the
demand paging test.

This series was tested by running the following invocations on an Intel
Skylake machine:
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20m -i 100 -v 64
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20g -i 5 -v 4
dirty_log_perf_test -b 4g -i 5 -v 32
demand_paging_test -b 20m -v 64
demand_paging_test -b 20g -v 4
demand_paging_test -b 4g -v 32
All behaved as expected.
