Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix calling sk_filter on non-socket based channel

Only sockets will have the chan->data set to an actual sk, channels
like A2MP would have its own data which would likely cause a crash when
calling sk_filter, in order to fix this a new callback has been
introduced so channels can implement their own filtering if necessary.
