gfs2: rename gfs2_write_full_page to gfs2_write_jdata_page, remove parm

Since the function is only used for writing jdata pages, this patch
simply renames function gfs2_write_full_page to a more appropriate
name: gfs2_write_jdata_page. This makes the code easier to understand.

The function was only called in one place, which passed in a pointer to
function gfs2_get_block_noalloc. The function doesn't need to be
passed in. Therefore, this also eliminates the unnecessary parameter
to increase efficiency.

I also took the liberty of cleaning up the function comments.
