octeontx2-af: cleanup KPU config data

Refactor KPU related NPC code gathering all configuration data in a
structured format and putting it in one place (npc_profile.h).
This increases readability and makes it easier to extend the profile
configuration (as opposed to jumping between multiple header and source
files).

To do this:
* Gather all KPU profile related data into a single adapter struct.
* Convert the built-in MKEX definition to a structured one to streamline
  the MKEX loading.
* Convert LT default register configuration into a structure, keeping
  default protocol settings in same file where identifiers for those
  protocols are defined.
* Add a single point for KPU profile loading, so that its source may
  change in the future once proper interfaces for loading such config
  are in place.
