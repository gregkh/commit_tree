net/af_iucv: set correct sk_protocol for child sockets

Child sockets erroneously inherit their parent's sk_type (ie. SOCK_*),
instead of the PF_IUCV protocol that the parent was created with in
iucv_sock_create().

We're currently not using sk->sk_protocol ourselves, so this shouldn't
have much impact (except eg. getting the output in skb_dump() right).
