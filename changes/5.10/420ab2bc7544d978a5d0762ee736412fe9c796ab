powerpc/tau: Remove duplicated set_thresholds() call

The commentary at the call site seems to disagree with the code. The
conditional prevents calling set_thresholds() via the exception handler,
which appears to crash. Perhaps that's because it immediately triggers
another TAU exception. Anyway, calling set_thresholds() from TAUupdate()
is redundant because tau_timeout() does so.
