samples: bpf: Driver interrupt statistics in xdpsock

Add an option to count the number of interrupts generated per second and
total number of interrupts during the lifetime of the application for a
given interface. This information is extracted from /proc/interrupts. Since
there is no naming convention across drivers, the user must provide the
string which is specific to their interface in the /proc/interrupts file on
the command line.

Usage:

./xdpsock ... -I <irq_str>

eg. for queue 0 of i40e device eth0:

./xdpsock ... -I i40e-eth0-TxRx-0
