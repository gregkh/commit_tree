net: udp: fix UDP header access on Fast/frag0 UDP GRO

UDP GRO uses udp_hdr(skb) in its .gro_receive() callback. While it's
probably OK for non-frag0 paths (when all headers or even the entire
frame are already in skb head), this inline points to junk when
using Fast GRO (napi_gro_frags() or napi_gro_receive() with only
Ethernet header in skb head and all the rest in the frags) and breaks
GRO packet compilation and the packet flow itself.
To support both modes, skb_gro_header_fast() + skb_gro_header_slow()
are typically used. UDP even has an inline helper that makes use of
them, udp_gro_udphdr(). Use that instead of troublemaking udp_hdr()
to get rid of the out-of-order delivers.

Present since the introduction of plain UDP GRO in 5.0-rc1.
