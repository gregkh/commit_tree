PCI: dwc: Restore ATU memory resource setup to use last entry

Prior to commit 0f71c60ffd26 ("PCI: dwc: Remove storing of PCI resources"),
the DWC driver was setting up the last memory resource rather than the
first memory resource. This doesn't matter for most platforms which only
have 1 memory resource, but it broke Tegra194 which has a 2nd
(prefetchable) memory region that requires an ATU entry. The first region
on Tegra194 relies on the default 1:1 pass-thru of outbound transactions
and doesn't need an ATU entry.
