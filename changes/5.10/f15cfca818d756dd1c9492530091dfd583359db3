ALSA: usb-audio: Add implicit feedback quirk for Zoom UAC-2

The Zoom UAC-2 USB audio interface provides an async playback endpoint
("1 OUT (ASYNC)") and capture endpoint ("2 IN (ASYNC)"), both with
2-channel S32_LE in 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, or 192
kilosamples/s. The device provides explicit feedback to adjust the
host's playback rate, but the feedback appears unstable and biased
relative to the device's capture rate.

"alsaloop -t 1000" experiences playback underruns and tries to
resample the captured audio to match the varying playback
rate. Forcing the kernel to use implicit feedback appears to
produce more stable results. This causes the host to transmit one
playback sample for each capture sample received. (Zoom North America
has been notified of this change.)
