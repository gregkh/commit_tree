usb: typec: Add QCOM PMIC typec detection driver

The QCOM SPMI typec driver handles the role and orientation detection, and
notifies client drivers using the USB role switch framework.   It registers
as a typec port, so orientation can be communicated using the typec switch
APIs.  The driver also attains a handle to the VBUS output regulator, so it
can enable/disable the VBUS source when acting as a host/device.
