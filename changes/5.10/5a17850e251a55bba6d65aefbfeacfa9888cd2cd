arm/build: Warn on orphan section placement

We don't want to depend on the linker's orphan section placement
heuristics as these can vary between linkers, and may change between
versions. All sections need to be explicitly handled in the linker
script.

Specifically, this would have made a recently fixed bug very obvious:

ld: warning: orphan section `.fixup' from `arch/arm/lib/copy_from_user.o' being placed in section `.fixup'

With all sections handled, enable orphan section warning.
