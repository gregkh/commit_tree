clk: renesas: r9a06g032: Drop __packed for portability

The R9A06G032 clock driver uses an array of packed structures to reduce
kernel size.  However, this array contains pointers, which are no longer
aligned naturally, and cannot be relocated on PPC64.  Hence when
compile-testing this driver on PPC64 with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y (e.g.
PowerPC allyesconfig), the following warnings are produced:

    WARNING: 136 bad relocations
    c000000000616be3 R_PPC64_UADDR64   .rodata+0x00000000000cf338
    c000000000616bfe R_PPC64_UADDR64   .rodata+0x00000000000cf370
    ...

Fix this by dropping the __packed attribute from the r9a06g032_clkdesc
definition, trading a small size increase for portability.

This increases the 156-entry clock table by 1 byte per entry, but due to
the compiler generating more efficient code for unpacked accesses, the
net size increase is only 76 bytes (gcc 9.3.0 on arm32).
