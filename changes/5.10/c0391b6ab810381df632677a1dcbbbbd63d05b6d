netfilter: nf_tables: missing validation from the abort path

If userspace does not include the trailing end of batch message, then
nfnetlink aborts the transaction. This allows to check that ruleset
updates trigger no errors.

After this patch, invoking this command from the prerouting chain:

 # nft -c add rule x y fib saddr . oif type local

fails since oif is not supported there.

This patch fixes the lack of rule validation from the abort/check path
to catch configuration errors such as the one above.
