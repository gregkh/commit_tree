nvme: opencode revalidate_disk in nvme_validate_ns

Keep control in the NVMe driver instead of going through an indirect
call back into ->revalidate_disk.  Also reorder the function a bit to be
easier to follow with the additional code.

And now that we have removed all callers of revalidate_disk() in the nvme
code, ->revalidate_disk is only called from the open code when first
opening the device.  Which is of course totally pointless as we have
a valid size since the initial scan, and will get an updated view
through the asynchronous notifiation everytime the size changes.
