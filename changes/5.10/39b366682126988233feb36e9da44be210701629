staging: wfx: add workaround for 'timeout while wake up chip'

The host and the device can be connected with a called Wake-Up GPIO.
When the host fall down this GPIO, it allows the device to enter in deep
sleep and no communication with the device is no more possible (the
device wakes up automatically on DTIM and fetch data if necessary).

So, before to communicate with the device, the driver have to raise the
Wake-up GPIO and then wait for an IRQ from the device.

Unfortunately, old firmwares have a race in sleep/wake-up process and
the device may never wake up. In this case, the IRQ is not sent and
driver complains with "timeout while wake up chip". Then, the driver
tries anyway to access the bus and an other error is raised by the bus.

Fortunately, when the bug occurs, it is possible to fall down the IRQ
and the device will eventually finish the sleep process. Then the driver
can wake it up normally.

The patch implements that workaround and add a retry limit in case
something goes very wrong.
