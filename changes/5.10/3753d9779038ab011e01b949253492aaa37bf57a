net: fix build without CONFIG_SYSCTL definition

Earlier commit 316cdaa1158a ("net: add option to not create fall-back
tunnels in root-ns as well") removed the CONFIG_SYSCTL to enable the
kernel-commandline to work. However, this variable gets defined only
when CONFIG_SYSCTL option is selected.

With this change the behavior would default to creating fall-back
tunnels in all namespaces when CONFIG_SYSCTL is not selected and
the kernel commandline option will be ignored.
