afs: Fix tracing deref-before-check

The patch dca54a7bbb8c: "afs: Add tracing for cell refcount and active user
count" from Oct 13, 2020, leads to the following Smatch complaint:

    fs/afs/cell.c:596 afs_unuse_cell()
    warn: variable dereferenced before check 'cell' (see line 592)

Fix this by moving the retrieval of the cell debug ID to after the check of
the validity of the cell pointer.
