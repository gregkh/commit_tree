KVM: x86: Rename "shared_msrs" to "user_return_msrs"

Rename the "shared_msrs" mechanism, which is used to defer restoring
MSRs that are only consumed when running in userspace, to a more banal
but less likely to be confusing "user_return_msrs".

The "shared" nomenclature is confusing as it's not obvious who is
sharing what, e.g. reasonable interpretations are that the guest value
is shared by vCPUs in a VM, or that the MSR value is shared/common to
guest and host, both of which are wrong.

"shared" is also misleading as the MSR value (in hardware) is not
guaranteed to be shared/reused between VMs (if that's indeed the correct
interpretation of the name), as the ability to share values between VMs
is simply a side effect (albiet a very nice side effect) of deferring
restoration of the host value until returning from userspace.

"user_return" avoids the above confusion by describing the mechanism
itself instead of its effects.
