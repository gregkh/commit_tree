i2c: designware: call i2c_dw_read_clear_intrbits_slave() once

If some bits were cleared by i2c_dw_read_clear_intrbits_slave() in
i2c_dw_isr_slave() and not handled immediately, those cleared bits would
not be shown again by later i2c_dw_read_clear_intrbits_slave(). They
therefore were forgotten to be handled.

i2c_dw_read_clear_intrbits_slave() should be called once in an ISR and take
its returned state for all later handlings.
