power: supply: goldfish: skip 'struct acpi_device_id' when !CONFIG_ACPI

Since ACPI_PTR() is used to NULLify the value when !CONFIG_ACPI, the
struct acpi_device_id becomes unused:

  drivers/power/supply/goldfish_battery.c:269:36: warning:
    'goldfish_battery_acpi_match' defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
