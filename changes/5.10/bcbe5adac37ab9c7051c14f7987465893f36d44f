media: Revert "media: mtk-vcodec: Remove extra area allocation in an input buffer on encoding"

This reverts commit 81735ecb62f882853a37a8c157407ec4aed44fd0.

The hardware needs data to follow the previous alignment, so this extra
space was not superfluous after all. Besides, this also made
v4l2-compliance's G_FMT and S_FMT tests regress.
