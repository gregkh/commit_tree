KVM: x86: Move call to update_exception_bitmap() into VMX code

Now that vcpu_after_set_cpuid() and update_exception_bitmap() are called
back-to-back, subsume the exception bitmap update into the common CPUID
update.  Drop the SVM invocation entirely as SVM's exception bitmap
doesn't vary with respect to guest CPUID.
