net: mscc: ocelot: generalize existing code for VCAP

In the Ocelot switches there are 3 TCAMs: VCAP ES0, IS1 and IS2, which
have the same configuration interface, but different sets of keys and
actions. The driver currently only supports VCAP IS2.

In preparation of VCAP IS1 and ES0 support, the existing code must be
generalized to work with any VCAP.

In that direction, we should move the structures that depend upon VCAP
instantiation, like vcap_is2_keys and vcap_is2_actions, out of struct
ocelot and into struct vcap_props .keys and .actions, a structure that
is replicated 3 times, once per VCAP. We'll pass that structure as an
argument to each function that does the key and action packing - only
the control logic needs to distinguish between ocelot->vcap[VCAP_IS2]
or IS1 or ES0.

Another change is to make use of the newly introduced ocelot_target_read
and ocelot_target_write API, since the 3 VCAPs have the same registers
but put at different addresses.
