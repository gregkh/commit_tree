scsi: ufs: Handle LINERESET indication in err handler

PA Layer issues a LINERESET to the PHY at the recovery step in the Power
Mode change operation. If it happens during auto or manual hibern8 enter,
even if hibern8 enter succeeds, UFS power mode shall be set to PWM-G1 mode
and kept in that mode after exit from hibern8, leading to bad performance.
Handle the LINERESET in the eh_work by restoring power mode to HS mode
after all pending reqs and tasks are cleared from doorbell.
