drm/i915/gvt: Set SNOOP for PAT3 on BXT/APL to workaround GPU BB hang

If guest fills non-priv bb on ApolloLake/Broxton as Mesa i965 does in:
717e7539124d (i965: Use a WC map and memcpy for the batch instead of pw-)
Due to the missing flush of bb filled by VM vCPU, host GPU hangs on
executing these MI_BATCH_BUFFER.

Temporarily workaround this by setting SNOOP bit for PAT3 used by PPGTT
PML4 PTE: PAT(0) PCD(1) PWT(1).

The performance is still expected to be low, will need further improvement.
