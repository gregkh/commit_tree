ARM: 9003/1: uncompress: Delete unused debug macros

The debug macros debug_reloc_start and debug_reloc_end were
rendered unused in commit 6d7d0ae51574943bf571d269da3243257a2d15db
"ARM: 6750/1: improvements to compressed/head.S".

Later on a different debug macro named dbgkc was introduced
in commit f3c899927e19d1be39818145efc39ea27b8efc69
"ARM: 8786/1: Debug kernel copy by printing".

Delete the dead debug code.
