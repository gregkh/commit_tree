brcmfmac: check return value of driver_for_each_device()

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/usb.c:1576:6: warning:
 variable 'ret' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  1576 |  int ret;
       |      ^~~

driver_for_each_device() has been declared with __must_check, so the
return value should be checked.
