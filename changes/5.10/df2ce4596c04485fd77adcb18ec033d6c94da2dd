drm/amdgpu: Convert to using devm_drm_dev_alloc() (v2)

Convert to using devm_drm_dev_alloc(),
as drm_dev_init() is going away.

v2: Remove drm_dev_put() since
    a) devres doesn't do refcounting, see
    Documentation/driver-api/driver-model/devres.rst,
    Section 4, paragraph 1; and since
    b) devres acts as garbage collector when
    the DRM device's parent's devres "action" callback
    is called to free the container device (amdgpu_device),
    which embeds the DRM dev.
