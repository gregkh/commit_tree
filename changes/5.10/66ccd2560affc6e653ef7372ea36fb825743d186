selinux: simplify away security_policydb_len()

Remove the security_policydb_len() calls from sel_open_policy() and
instead update the inode size from the size returned from
security_read_policy().

Since after this change security_policydb_len() is only called from
security_load_policy(), remove it entirely and just open-code it there.

Also, since security_load_policy() is always called with policy_mutex
held, make it dereference the policy pointer directly and drop the
unnecessary RCU locking.
