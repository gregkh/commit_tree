rtlwifi: Start changing RT_TRACE into rtl_dbg

The macro name RT_TRACE makes it seem that it is used for tracing, when
is actually used for debugging. Change the name to RT_DEBUG.

This step creates the new macro while keeping the old RT_TRACE to allow
building. It will be removed at the end of the patch series.
