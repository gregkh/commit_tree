bcache: explicitly make cache_set only have single cache

Currently although the bcache code has a framework for multiple caches
in a cache set, but indeed the multiple caches never completed and users
use md raid1 for multiple copies of the cached data.

This patch does the following change in struct cache_set, to explicitly
make a cache_set only have single cache,
- Change pointer array "*cache[MAX_CACHES_PER_SET]" to a single pointer
  "*cache".
- Remove pointer array "*cache_by_alloc[MAX_CACHES_PER_SET]".
- Remove "caches_loaded".

Now the code looks as exactly what it does in practic: only one cache is
used in the cache set.
