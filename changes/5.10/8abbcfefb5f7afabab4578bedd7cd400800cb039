perf/x86/intel/uncore: Split the Ice Lake and Tiger Lake MSR uncore support

Previously, the MSR uncore for the Ice Lake and Tiger Lake are
identical. The code path is shared. However, with recent update, the
global MSR_UNC_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL register and ARB uncore unit are changed
for the Ice Lake. Split the Ice Lake and Tiger Lake MSR uncore support.

The changes only impact the MSR ops() and the ARB uncore unit. Other
codes can still be shared between the Ice Lake and the Tiger Lake.
