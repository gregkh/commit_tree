libbpf: Implement generalized .BTF.ext func/line info adjustment

Complete multi-prog sections and multi sub-prog support in libbpf by properly
adjusting .BTF.ext's line and function information. Mark exposed
btf_ext__reloc_func_info() and btf_ext__reloc_func_info() APIs as deprecated.
These APIs have simplistic assumption that all sub-programs are going to be
appended to all main BPF programs, which doesn't hold in real life. It's
unlikely there are any users of this API, as it's very libbpf
internals-specific.
