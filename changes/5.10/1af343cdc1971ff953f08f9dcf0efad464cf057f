drm/i915: Remove locking from i915_gem_object_prepare_read/write

Execbuffer submission will perform its own WW locking, and we
cannot rely on the implicit lock there.

This also makes it clear that the GVT code will get a lockdep splat when
multiple batchbuffer shadows need to be performed in the same instance,
fix that up.
