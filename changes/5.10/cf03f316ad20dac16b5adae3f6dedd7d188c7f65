fs: 9p: add generic splice_read file operations

The v9fs file operations were missing the splice_read operations, which
breaks sendfile() of files on such a filesystem. I discovered this while
trying to load an eBPF program using iproute2 inside a 'virtme' environment
which uses 9pfs for the virtual file system. iproute2 relies on sendfile()
with an AF_ALG socket to hash files, which was erroring out in the virtual
environment.

Since generic_file_splice_read() seems to just implement splice_read in
terms of the read_iter operation, I simply added the generic implementation
to the file operations, which fixed the error I was seeing. A quick grep
indicates that this is what most other file systems do as well.
