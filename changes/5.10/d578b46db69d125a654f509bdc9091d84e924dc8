erofs: avoid duplicated permission check for "trusted." xattrs

Don't recheck it since xattr_permission() already
checks CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

Just follow 5d3ce4f70172 ("f2fs: avoid duplicated permission check for "trusted." xattrs")

[ Gao Xiang: since it could cause some complex Android overlay
  permission issue as well on android-5.4+, it'd be better to
  backport to 5.4+ rather than pure cleanup on mainline. ]
