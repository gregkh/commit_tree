ext4: optimize file overwrites

In case if the file already has underlying blocks/extents allocated
then we don't need to start a journal txn and can directly return
the underlying mapping. Currently ext4_iomap_begin() is used by
both DAX & DIO path. We can check if the write request is an
overwrite & then directly return the mapping information.

This could give a significant perf boost for multi-threaded writes
specially random overwrites.
On PPC64 VM with simulated pmem(DAX) device, ~10x perf improvement
could be seen in random writes (overwrite). Also bcoz this optimizes
away the spinlock contention during jbd2 slab cache allocation
(jbd2_journal_handle). On x86 VM, ~2x perf improvement was observed.
