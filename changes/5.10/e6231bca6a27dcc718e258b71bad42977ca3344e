net: bridge: mcast: support for IGMPV3/MLDv2 MODE_IS_INCLUDE/EXCLUDE report

In order to process IGMPV3/MLDv2_MODE_IS_INCLUDE/EXCLUDE report types we
need some new helpers which allow us to set/clear flags for all current
entries and later delete marked entries after the report sources have been
processed.

v3: add IPv6/MLDv2 support
v2: drop flag helpers and directly do flag bit operations
