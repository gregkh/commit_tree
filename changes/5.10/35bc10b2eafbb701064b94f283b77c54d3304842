null_blk: synchronization fix for zoned device

Parallel write,read,zone-mgmt operations accessing/altering zone state
and write-pointer may get into race. Avoid the situation by using a new
spinlock for zoned device.
Concurrent zone-appends (on a zone) returning same write-pointer issue
is also avoided using this lock.
