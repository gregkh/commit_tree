ASoC: q6asm: make commands specific to streams

Each ASM session can have multiple streams attached to it,
current design was to allow only one static stream id 1 per each session.
However for use-case like gapless, we would need 2 streams to open per session.

This patch converts all the q6asm apis to take stream id as argument
to allow multiple streams to open on a single session, This is useful
for gapless playback cases.

Now the dai driver can specify which stream id for each command.
