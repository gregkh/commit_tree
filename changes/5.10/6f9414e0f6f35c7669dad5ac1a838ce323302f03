bcache: check and set sync status on cache's in-memory super block

Currently the cache's sync status is checked and set on cache set's in-
memory partial super block. After removing the embedded struct cache_sb
from cache set and reference cache's in-memory super block from struct
cache_set, the sync status can set and check directly on cache's super
block.

This patch checks and sets the cache sync status directly on cache's
in-memory super block. This is a preparation for later removing embedded
struct cache_sb from struct cache_set.
