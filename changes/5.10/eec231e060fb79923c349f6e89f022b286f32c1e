HID: logitech-dj: Fix an error in mse_bluetooth_descriptor

Fix an error in the mouse / INPUT(2) descriptor used for quad/bt2.0 combo
receivers. Replace INPUT with INPUT (Data,Var,Abs) for the field for the
4 extra buttons which share their report-byte with the low-res hwheel.

This is likely a copy and paste error. I've verified that the new
0x81, 0x02 value matches both the mouse descriptor for the currently
supported MX5000 / MX5500 receivers, as well as the INPUT(2) mouse
descriptors for the Dinovo receivers for which support is being
worked on.
