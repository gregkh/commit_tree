samples/bpf: Optimize l2fwd performance in xdpsock

Optimize the throughput performance of the l2fwd sub-app in the
xdpsock sample application by removing a duplicate syscall and
increasing the size of the fill ring.

The latter needs some further explanation. We recommend that you set
the fill ring size >= HW RX ring size + AF_XDP RX ring size. Make sure
you fill up the fill ring with buffers at regular intervals, and you
will with this setting avoid allocation failures in the driver. These
are usually quite expensive since drivers have not been written to
assume that allocation failures are common. For regular sockets,
kernel allocated memory is used that only runs out in OOM situations
that should be rare.

These two performance optimizations together lead to a 6% percent
improvement for the l2fwd app on my machine.
