tcp: return EPOLLOUT from tcp_poll only when notsent_bytes is half the limit

If there was any event available on the TCP socket, tcp_poll()
will be called to retrieve all the events.  In tcp_poll(), we call
sk_stream_is_writeable() which returns true as long as we are at least
one byte below notsent_lowat.  This will result in quite a few
spurious EPLLOUT and frequent tiny sendmsg() calls as a result.

Similar to sk_stream_write_space(), use __sk_stream_is_writeable
with a wake value of 1, so that we set EPOLLOUT only if half the
space is available for write.
