KVM: selftests: Use a single binary for dirty/clear log test

Remove the clear_dirty_log test, instead merge it into the existing
dirty_log_test.  It should be cleaner to use this single binary to do
both tests, also it's a preparation for the upcoming dirty ring test.

The default behavior will run all the modes in sequence.
