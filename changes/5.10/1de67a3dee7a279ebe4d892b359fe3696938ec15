i2c: imx: Check for I2SR_IAL after every byte

Arbitration Lost (IAL) can happen after every single byte transfer. If
arbitration is lost, the I2C hardware will autonomously switch from
master mode to slave. If a transfer is not aborted in this state,
consecutive transfers will not be executed by the hardware and will
timeout.
