coredump: fix core_pattern parse error

'format_corename()' will splite 'core_pattern' on spaces when it is in
pipe mode, and take helper_argv[0] as the path to usermode executable.
It works fine in most cases.

However, if there is a space between '|' and '/file/path', such as
'| /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-coredump %P %u %g', then helper_argv[0] will
be parsed as '', and users will get a 'Core dump to | disabled'.

It is not friendly to users, as the pattern above was valid previously.
Fix this by ignoring the spaces between '|' and '/file/path'.
