igc: Fix returning wrong statistics

'igc_update_stats()' was not updating 'netdev->stats', so the returned
statistics, for example, requested by:

$ ip -s link show dev enp3s0

were not being updated and were always zero.

Fix by returning a set of statistics that are actually being
updated (adapter->stats64).
