mm/memcg: clean up obsolete enum charge_type

Patch series "mm/memcg: Miscellaneous cleanups and streamlining", v2.

This patch (of 3):

Since commit 0a31bc97c80c ("mm: memcontrol: rewrite uncharge API") and
commit 00501b531c47 ("mm: memcontrol: rewrite charge API") in v3.17, the
enum charge_type was no longer used anywhere.  However, the enum itself
was not removed at that time.  Remove the obsolete enum charge_type now.
