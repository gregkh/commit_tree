xen/blkback: use lateeoi irq binding

In order to reduce the chance for the system becoming unresponsive due
to event storms triggered by a misbehaving blkfront use the lateeoi
irq binding for blkback and unmask the event channel only after
processing all pending requests.

As the thread processing requests is used to do purging work in regular
intervals an EOI may be sent only after having received an event. If
there was no pending I/O request flag the EOI as spurious.

This is part of XSA-332.
