x86/apic/msi: Unbreak DMAR and HPET MSI

Switching the DMAR and HPET MSI code to use the generic MSI domain ops
missed to add the flag which tells the core code to update the domain
operations with the defaults. As a consequence the core code crashes
when an interrupt in one of those domains is allocated.

Add the missing flags.
