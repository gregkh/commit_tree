drivers/net/ethernet: clean up mis-targeted comments

As part of the W=1 cleanups for ethernet, a million [*] driver
comments had to be cleaned up to get the W=1 compilation to
succeed. This change finally makes the drivers/net/ethernet tree
compile with W=1 set on the command line. NOTE: The kernel uses
kdoc style (see Documentation/process/kernel-doc.rst) when
documenting code, not doxygen or other styles.

After this patch the x86_64 build has no warnings from W=1, however
scripts/kernel-doc says there are 1545 more warnings in source files, that
I need to develop a script to fix in a followup patch.

The errors fixed here are all kdoc of a few classes, with a few outliers:

Normal kdoc fixes:
warning: Function parameter or member 'x' not described in 'y'
warning: Excess function parameter 'x' description in 'y'
warning: Cannot understand <string> on line <NNN> - I thought it was a doc line

[*] - ok it wasn't quite a million, but it felt like it.
