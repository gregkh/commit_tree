net: dsa: Register devlink ports before calling DSA driver setup()

DSA drivers want to create regions on devlink ports as well as the
devlink device instance, in order to export registers and other tables
per port. To keep all this code together in the drivers, have the
devlink ports registered early, so the setup() method can setup both
device and port devlink regions.

v3:
Remove dp->setup
Move common code out of switch statement.
Fix wrong goto
