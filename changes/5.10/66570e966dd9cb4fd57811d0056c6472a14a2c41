kvm: x86: only provide PV features if enabled in guest's CPUID

KVM unconditionally provides PV features to the guest, regardless of the
configured CPUID. An unwitting guest that doesn't check
KVM_CPUID_FEATURES before use could access paravirt features that
userspace did not intend to provide. Fix this by checking the guest's
CPUID before performing any paravirtual operations.

Introduce a capability, KVM_CAP_ENFORCE_PV_FEATURE_CPUID, to gate the
aforementioned enforcement. Migrating a VM from a host w/o this patch to
a host with this patch could silently change the ABI exposed to the
guest, warranting that we default to the old behavior and opt-in for
the new one.
