locking: More accurate annotations for read_lock()

On the archs using QUEUED_RWLOCKS, read_lock() is not always a recursive
read lock, actually it's only recursive if in_interrupt() is true. So
change the annotation accordingly to catch more deadlocks.

Note we used to treat read_lock() as pure recursive read locks in
lib/locking-seftest.c, and this is useful, especially for the lockdep
development selftest, so we keep this via a variable to force switching
lock annotation for read_lock().
