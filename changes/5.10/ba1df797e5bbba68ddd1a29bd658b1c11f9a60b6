NFSACL: Replace PROC() macro with open code

Clean up: Follow-up on ten-year-old commit b9081d90f5b9 ("NFS: kill
off complicated macro 'PROC'") by performing the same conversion in
the NFSACL code. To reduce the chance of error, I copied the original
C preprocessor output and then made some minor edits.
