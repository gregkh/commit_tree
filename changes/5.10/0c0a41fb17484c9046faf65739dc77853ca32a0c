pinctrl: armada-37xx: Add comment for pcie1_reset pin group

Group name 'pcie1' is misleading as it controls only PCIe reset pin. Like
other PCIe groups it should have been called 'pcie1_reset'. But due to
backward compatibility it is not possible to change existing group name.
So just add comment describing this PCIe reset functionality.
