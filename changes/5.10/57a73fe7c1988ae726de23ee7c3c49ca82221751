bpf, selftests: Make redirect_neigh test more extensible

Rename into test_tc_redirect.sh and move setup and test code into separate
functions so they can be reused for newly added tests in here. Also remove
the crude hack to override ifindex inside the object file via xxd and sed
and just use a simple map instead. Map given iproute2 does not support BTF
fully and therefore neither global data at this point.
