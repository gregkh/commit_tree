net/smc: fix invalid return code in smcd_new_buf_create()

smc_ism_register_dmb() returns error codes set by the ISM driver which
are not guaranteed to be negative or in the errno range. Such values
would not be handled by ERR_PTR() and finally the return code will be
used as a memory address.
Fix that by using a valid negative errno value with ERR_PTR().
