ibmvnic: enhance resetting status check during module exit

Based on the discussion with Sukadev Bhattiprolu and Dany Madden,
we believe that checking adapter->resetting bit is preferred
since RESETTING state flag is not as strict as resetting bit.
RESETTING state flag is removed since it is verbose now.
