mm: remove activate_page() from unuse_pte()

We don't initially add anon pages to active lruvec after commit
b518154e59aa ("mm/vmscan: protect the workingset on anonymous LRU").
Remove activate_page() from unuse_pte(), which seems to be missed by the
commit.  And make the function static while we are at it.

Before the commit, we called lru_cache_add_active_or_unevictable() to add
new ksm pages to active lruvec.  Therefore, activate_page() wasn't
necessary for them in the first place.
