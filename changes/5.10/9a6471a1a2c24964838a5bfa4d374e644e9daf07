spi: dw-dma: Check DMA Tx-desc submission status

We suggest to add the dmaengine_submit() return value test for errors.  It
has been unnecessary while the driver was expected to be utilized in pair
with DW DMAC. But since now the driver can be used with any DMA engine, it
might be useful to track the errors on DMA submissions so not miss them
and get into an unpredictable driver behaviour.
