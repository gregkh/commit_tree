vhost scsi: fix lun reset completion handling

vhost scsi owns the scsi se_cmd but lio frees the se_cmd->se_tmr
before calling release_cmd, so while with normal cmd completion we
can access the se_cmd from the vhost work, we can't do the same with
se_cmd->se_tmr. This has us copy the tmf response in
vhost_scsi_queue_tm_rsp to our internal vhost-scsi tmf struct for
when it gets sent to the guest from our worker thread.
