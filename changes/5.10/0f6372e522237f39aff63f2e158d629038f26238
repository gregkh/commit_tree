treewide: remove DISABLE_LTO

This change removes all instances of DISABLE_LTO from
Makefiles, as they are currently unused, and the preferred
method of disabling LTO is to filter out the flags instead.

Note added by Masahiro Yamada:
DISABLE_LTO was added as preparation for GCC LTO, but GCC LTO was
not pulled into the mainline. (https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/8/272)
