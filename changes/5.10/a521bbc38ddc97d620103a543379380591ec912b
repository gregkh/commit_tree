scsi: qedf: Check for port type and role before processing an event

The rport lock gets initialized during offload. If a non-FCP or non-target
rport got logout then this rport will be uninitialized. KASAN was
complaining because of it.

=========
[   14.384434] the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
[   14.384482] turning off the locking correctness validator.
