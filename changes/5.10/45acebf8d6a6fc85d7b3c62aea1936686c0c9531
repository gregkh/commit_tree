iwlwifi: fix sar geo table initialization

When adding support for version 3 of the GEO_TX_POWER_LIMIT command,
the table argument of iwl_sar_geo_init was changed from a pointer a 1d
array of now-removed iwl_per_chain_offset_group_v1 to a pointer to a 2d
array of iwl_per_chain_offset (iwl_per_chain_offset_group_v1 was a
struct containing 2 copies of iwl_per_chain_offset).

So even for version 2 where the second dimension is of length 2, which
means that the underlying memory layout of the array didn't change, this
requires a small change in the way we loop over it, and this was missed.

Additionally, for the case of version 3 where the second dimension is now
3, in order to fill the first two elements of each row correctly (lb and
hb), iwl_sar_geo_init must get the true number of bands supported.
But because we don't yet store any values for the 3rd (uhb) band, skip
that band.
