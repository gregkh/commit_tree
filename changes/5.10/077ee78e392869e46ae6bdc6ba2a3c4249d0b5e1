PCI/MSI: Make arch_.*_msi_irq[s] fallbacks selectable

The arch_.*_msi_irq[s] fallbacks are compiled in whether an architecture
requires them or not. Architectures which are fully utilizing hierarchical
irq domains should never call into that code.

It's not only architectures which depend on that by implementing one or
more of the weak functions, there is also a bunch of drivers which relies
on the weak functions which invoke msi_controller::setup_irq[s] and
msi_controller::teardown_irq.

Make the architectures and drivers which rely on them select them in Kconfig
and if not selected replace them by stub functions which emit a warning and
fail the PCI/MSI interrupt allocation.
