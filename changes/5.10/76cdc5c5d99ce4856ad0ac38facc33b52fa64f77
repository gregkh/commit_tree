ibmvnic: track pending login

If after ibmvnic sends a LOGIN it gets a FAILOVER, it is possible that
the worker thread will start reset process and free the login response
buffer before it gets a (now stale) LOGIN_RSP. The ibmvnic tasklet will
then try to access the login response buffer and crash.

Have ibmvnic track pending logins and discard any stale login responses.
