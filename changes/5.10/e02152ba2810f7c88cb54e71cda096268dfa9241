powerpc: Drop -me200 addition to build flags

Currently a build with CONFIG_E200=y will fail with:

  Error: invalid switch -me200
  Error: unrecognized option -me200

Upstream binutils has never supported an -me200 option. Presumably it
was supported at some point by either a fork or Freescale internal
binutils.

We can't support code that we can't even build test, so drop the
addition of -me200 to the build flags, so we can at least build with
CONFIG_E200=y.
