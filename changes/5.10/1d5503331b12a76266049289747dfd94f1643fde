drm/amd/display: fix potential integer overflow when shifting 32 bit variable bl_pwm

The 32 bit unsigned integer bl_pwm is being shifted using 32 bit arithmetic
and then being assigned to a 64 bit unsigned integer.  There is a potential
for a 32 bit overflow so cast bl_pwm to enforce a 64 bit shift operation
to avoid this.

Addresses-Coverity: ("unintentional integer overflow")
