PCI: qcom: Make sure PCIe is reset before init for rev 2.1.0

Qsdk U-Boot can incorrectly leave the PCIe interface in an undefined
state if bootm command is used instead of bootipq. This is caused by the
not deinit of PCIe when bootm is called. Reset the PCIe before init
anyway to fix this U-Boot bug.
