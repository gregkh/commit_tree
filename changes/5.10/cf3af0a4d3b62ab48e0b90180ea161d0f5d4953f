MIPS: DEC: Restore bootmem reservation for firmware working memory area

Fix a crash on DEC platforms starting with:

VFS: Mounted root (nfs filesystem) on device 0:11.

Disabling lock debugging due to kernel taint

caused by an attempt to free bootmem space that as from
commit b93ddc4f9156 ("mips: Reserve memory for the kernel image resources")
has not been anymore reserved due to the removal of generic MIPS arch code
that used to reserve all the memory from the beginning of RAM up to the
kernel load address.

This memory does need to be reserved on DEC platforms however as it is
used by REX firmware as working area, as per the TURBOchannel firmware
specification[1]:

Table 2-2  REX Memory Regions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Starting        Ending
Region  Address         Address         Use
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
0       0xa0000000      0xa000ffff      Restart block, exception vectors,
                                        REX stack and bss
1       0xa0010000      0xa0017fff      Keyboard or tty drivers

2       0xa0018000      0xa001f3ff 1)   CRT driver

3       0xa0020000      0xa002ffff      boot, cnfg, init and t objects

4       0xa0020000      0xa002ffff      64KB scratch space
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Note that the last 3 Kbytes of region 2 are reserved for backward
compatibility with previous system software.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

(this table uses KSEG2 unmapped virtual addresses, which in the MIPS
architecture are offset from physical addresses by a fixed value of
0xa0000000 and therefore the regions referred do correspond to the
beginning of the physical address space) and we call into the firmware
on several occasions throughout the bootstrap process.  It is believed
that pre-REX firmware used with non-TURBOchannel DEC platforms has the
same requirements, as hinted by note #1 cited.

Recreate the discarded reservation then, in DEC platform code, removing
the crash.
