bpf: Disallow BPF_PRELOAD in allmodconfig builds

The CC_CAN_LINK checks that the host compiler can link, but bpf_preload
relies on libbpf which in turn needs libelf to be present during linking.
allmodconfig runs in odd setups with cross compilers and missing host
libraries like libelf. Instead of extending kconfig with every possible
library that bpf_preload might need disallow building BPF_PRELOAD in
such build-only configurations.
