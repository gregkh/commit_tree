mmc: via-sdmmc: Fix data race bug

via_save_pcictrlreg() should be called with host->lock held
as it writes to pm_pcictrl_reg, otherwise there can be a race
condition between via_sd_suspend() and via_sdc_card_detect().
The same pattern is used in the function via_reset_pcictrl()
as well, where via_save_pcictrlreg() is called with host->lock
held.
