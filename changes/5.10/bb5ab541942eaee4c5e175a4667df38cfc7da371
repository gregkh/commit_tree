s390/qeth: keep track of wanted TX queues

When re-initializing a device, we can hit a situation where
qeth_osa_set_output_queues() detects that it supports more or less
HW TX queues than before. Right now we adjust dev->real_num_tx_queues
from right there, but
1. it's getting more & more complicated to cover all cases, and
2. we can't re-enable the actually expected number of TX queues later
because we lost the needed information.

So keep track of the wanted TX queues (on initial setup, and whenever
its changed via .set_channels), and later use that information when
re-enabling the netdevice.
