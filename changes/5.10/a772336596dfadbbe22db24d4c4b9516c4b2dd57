platform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: Re-order connector configuration steps

As per USB Type-C Spec R2.0 section 4.5.1.2 (Connecting Sources and Sinks)
and section 4.5.2.2 (Connection State Machine Requirements), the typical
flow for configuring a device connected to a typeC port is as below:

1. Source/sink detection
2. Orientation
3. Data role
4. VCONN
5. VBUS (USB Type-C currents)
6. The connector is now configured. We can start the PD communication
   that should lead into configuration of the mux if we enter a mode.

But in existing code data role was set after the connector and mux are
already configured. So fix this by following the spec to set the data
role before the connector and mux are configured.
