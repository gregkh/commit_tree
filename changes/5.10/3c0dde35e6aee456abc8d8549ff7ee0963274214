media: [next] media: vidtv: fix a read from an object after it has been freed

Currently the call to vidtv_psi_pat_table_destroy frees the object
m->si.pat however m->si.pat->num_pmt is being accessed after the
free.  Fix this by destroying m->si.pat after the m->si.pmt_secs[]
objects have been freed.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Read from pointer after free")
