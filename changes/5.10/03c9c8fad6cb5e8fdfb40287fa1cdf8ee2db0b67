arm64: kprobe: clarify the comment of steppable hint instructions

The existing comment about steppable hint instruction is not complete
and only describes NOP instructions as steppable. As the function
aarch64_insn_is_steppable_hint allows all white-listed instruction
to be probed so the comment is updated to reflect this.
