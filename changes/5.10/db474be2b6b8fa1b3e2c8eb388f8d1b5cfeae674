interconnect: qcom: Only wait for completion in AMC/WAKE by default

Change the default TCS wait behavior to only wait for completion in AMC
and WAKE. Waiting isn't necessary in the SLEEP TCS, since votes are only
being removed in this case. Resources can be safely disabled
asynchronously in parallel with the rest of the power collapse sequence.
This reduces the sleep entry latency.
