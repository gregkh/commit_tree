mm/hugetlb: not necessary to coalesce regions recursively

Patch series "mm/hugetlb: code refine and simplification", v4.

Following are some cleanups for hugetlb.  Simple testing with
tools/testing/selftests/vm/map_hugetlb passes.

This patch (of 7):

Per my understanding, we keep the regions ordered and would always
coalesce regions properly.  So the task to keep this property is just to
coalesce its neighbour.

Let's simplify this.
