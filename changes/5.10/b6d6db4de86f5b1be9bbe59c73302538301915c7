KVM: arm64: Remove leftover kern_hyp_va() in nVHE TLB invalidation

The new calling convention says that pointers coming from the SMCCC
interface are turned into their HYP version in the host HVC handler.
However, there is still a stray kern_hyp_va() in the TLB invalidation
code, which could result in a corrupted pointer.

Drop the spurious conversion.
