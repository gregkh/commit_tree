powerpc/smp: Move ppc_md.cpu_die() to smp_ops.cpu_offline_self()

We have smp_ops->cpu_die() and ppc_md.cpu_die(). One of them offlines
the current CPU and one offlines another CPU, can you guess which is
which? Also one is in smp_ops and one is in ppc_md?

So rename ppc_md.cpu_die(), to cpu_offline_self(), because that's what
it does. And move it into smp_ops where it belongs.
