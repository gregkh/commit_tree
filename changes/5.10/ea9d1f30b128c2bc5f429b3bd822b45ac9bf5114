net: mscc: ocelot: offload multiple tc-flower actions in same rule

At this stage, the tc-flower offload of mscc_ocelot can only delegate
rules to the VCAP IS2 security enforcement block. These rules have, in
hardware, separate bits for policing and for overriding the destination
port mask and/or copying to the CPU. So it makes sense that we attempt
to expose some more of that low-level complexity instead of simply
choosing between a single type of action.

Something similar happens with the VCAP IS1 block, where the same action
can contain enable bits for VLAN classification and for QoS
classification at the same time.

So model the action structure after the hardware description, and let
the high-level ocelot_flower.c construct an action vector from multiple
tc actions.
