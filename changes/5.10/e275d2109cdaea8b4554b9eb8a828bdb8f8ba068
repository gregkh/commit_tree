bus: ti-sysc: Fix reset status check for modules with quirks

Commit d46f9fbec719 ("bus: ti-sysc: Use optional clocks on for enable and
wait for softreset bit") started showing a "OCP softreset timed out"
warning on enable if the interconnect target module is not out of reset.
This caused the warning to be often triggered for i2c and hdq while the
devices are working properly.

Turns out that some interconnect target modules seem to have an unusable
reset status bits unless the module specific reset quirks are activated.

Let's just skip the reset status check for those modules as we only want
to activate the reset quirks when doing a reset, and not on enable. This
way we don't see the bogus "OCP softreset timed out" warnings during boot.
