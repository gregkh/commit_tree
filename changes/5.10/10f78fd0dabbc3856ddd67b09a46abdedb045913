powerpc/numa: Fix a regression on memoryless node 0

Commit e75130f20b1f ("powerpc/numa: Offline memoryless cpuless node 0")
offlines node 0 and expects nodes to be subsequently onlined when CPUs
or nodes are detected.

Commit 6398eaa26816 ("powerpc/numa: Prefer node id queried from vphn")
skips onlining node 0 when CPUs are associated with node 0.

On systems with node 0 having CPUs but no memory, this causes node 0 be
marked offline. This causes issues at boot time when trying to set
memory node for online CPUs while building the zonelist.

Fix this by setting node to be online while onlining CPUs that belong to
node 0.
