node: Add access1 class to represent CPU to memory characteristics

New access1 class is nearly the same as access0, but always provides
characteristics for CPUs to memory.   The existing access0 class
provides characteristics to nearest or direct connnect initiator
which may be a Generic Initiator such as a GPU or network adapter.

This new class allows thread placement on CPUs to be performed
so as to give optimal access characteristics to memory, even if that
memory is for example attached to a GPU or similar and only accessible
to the CPU via an appropriate bus.
