vfio/fsl-mc: Fixed vfio-fsl-mc driver compilation on 32 bit

The FSL_MC_BUS on which the VFIO-FSL-MC driver is dependent on
can be compiled on other architectures as well (not only ARM64)
including 32 bit architectures.
Include linux/io-64-nonatomic-hi-lo.h to make writeq/readq used
in the driver available on 32bit platforms.
