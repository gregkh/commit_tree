vfs: move generic_remap_checks out of mm

I would like to move all the generic helpers for the vfs remap range
functionality (aka clonerange and dedupe) into a separate file so that
they won't be scattered across the vfs and the mm subsystems.  The
eventual goal is to be able to deselect remap_range.c if none of the
filesystems need that code, but the tricky part here is picking a
stable(ish) part of the merge window to rearrange code.
