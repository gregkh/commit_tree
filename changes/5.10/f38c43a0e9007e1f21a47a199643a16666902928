scsi: mpt3sas: Detect tampered Aero and Sea adapters

The driver will throw an error message when a tampered type controller
is detected. The intent is to avoid interacting with any firmware
which is not secured/signed by Broadcom. Any tampering on firmware
component will be detected by hardware and it will be communicated to
the driver to avoid any further interaction with that component.
