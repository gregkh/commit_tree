net: ipa: kill unused status exceptions

Only the deaggregation status exception type is ever actually used.
If any other status exception type is reported we basically ignore
it, and consume the packet.  Remove the unused definitions of status
exception type symbols; they can be added back when we actually
handle them.

Separately, two consecutive if statements test the same condition
near the top of ipa_endpoint_suspend_one().  Instead, use a single
test with a block that combines the previously-separate lines of
code.
