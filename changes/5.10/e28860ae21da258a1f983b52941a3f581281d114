drm/i915: Make the stale cached active node available for any timeline

Rather than require the next timeline after idling to match the MRU
before idling, reset the index on the node and allow it to match the
first request. However, this requires cmpxchg(u64) and so is not trivial
on 32b, so for compatibility we just fallback to keeping the cached node
pointing to the MRU timeline.
