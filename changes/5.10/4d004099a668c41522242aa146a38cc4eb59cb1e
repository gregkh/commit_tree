lockdep: Fix lockdep recursion

Steve reported that lockdep_assert*irq*(), when nested inside lockdep
itself, will trigger a false-positive.

One example is the stack-trace code, as called from inside lockdep,
triggering tracing, which in turn calls RCU, which then uses
lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled().
