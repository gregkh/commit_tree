ice: add support for flash update overwrite mask

Support the recently added DEVLINK_ATTR_FLASH_UPDATE_OVERWRITE_MASK
parameter in the ice flash update handler. Convert the overwrite mask
bitfield into the appropriate preservation level used by the firmware
when updating.

Because there is no equivalent preservation level for overwriting only
identifiers, this combination is rejected by the driver as not supported
with an appropriate extended ACK message.
