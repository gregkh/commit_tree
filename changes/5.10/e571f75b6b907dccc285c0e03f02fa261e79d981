media: exynos4-is: Handle duplicate calls to vidioc_streamoff

vidioc_streamoff can be called multiple times from userspace, but we
should only call media_pipeline_stop when we're actually setup.

This became more noticeable after commit 2a2599c66368 ("[media] media:
entity: Catch unbalanced media_pipeline_stop calls") was merged as it
added a WARN for unbalanced calls to media_pipeline_stop.
