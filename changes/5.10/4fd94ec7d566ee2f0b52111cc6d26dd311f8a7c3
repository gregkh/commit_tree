KVM: selftests: Introduce the dirty log perf test

The dirty log perf test will time verious dirty logging operations
(enabling dirty logging, dirtying memory, getting the dirty log,
clearing the dirty log, and disabling dirty logging) in order to
quantify dirty logging performance. This test can be used to inform
future performance improvements to KVM's dirty logging infrastructure.

This series was tested by running the following invocations on an Intel
Skylake machine:
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20m -i 100 -v 64
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20g -i 5 -v 4
dirty_log_perf_test -b 4g -i 5 -v 32
demand_paging_test -b 20m -v 64
demand_paging_test -b 20g -v 4
demand_paging_test -b 4g -v 32
All behaved as expected.
