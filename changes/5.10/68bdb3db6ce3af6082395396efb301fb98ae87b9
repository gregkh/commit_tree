scsi: ufs-qcom: Remove unused MSM bus scaling APIs

MSM bus scaling has moved on to use interconnect framework and downstream
bus scaling APIs like msm_bus_scale*() do not exist anymore in the
kernel. Currently they are guarded by a config which also does not exist
and hence there are no build failures reported. Remove these unused
interfaces as they are currently no-ops and the scaling support that may be
added in future will use interconnect API.
