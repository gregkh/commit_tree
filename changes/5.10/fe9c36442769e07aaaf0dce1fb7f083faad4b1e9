pinctrl: nomadik: Fix pull direction debug info

The nomadik pinctrl hardware doesn't have any way to
determine if the active pull is up or down. Reading
the bit currently used to report if the pull is up/down
indicates if the gpio input is reading high or low, it
doesn't reflect the pull state.

For this reason change the output from "pull up"/"pull down" to
"pull enabled". This avoids confusing developers who were using
the output to determine what the pull state is.
