tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Unconditionally call dev_pm_opp_of_remove_table()

dev_pm_opp_of_remove_table() doesn't report any errors when it fails to
find the OPP table with error -ENODEV (i.e. OPP table not present for
the device). And we can call dev_pm_opp_of_remove_table()
unconditionally here.

While at it, create a new label to put clkname on errors.
