net: mscc: ocelot: rename variable 'cnt' in vcap_data_offset_get()

The 'cnt' variable is actually used for 2 purposes, to hold the number
of sub-words per VCAP entry, and the number of sub-words per VCAP
action.

In fact, I'm pretty sure these 2 numbers can never be different from one
another. By hardware definition, the entry (key) TCAM rows are divided
into the same number of sub-words as its associated action RAM rows.
But nonetheless, let's at least rename the variables such that
observations like this one are easier to make in the future.
