rcutorture: Output number of elapsed grace periods

This commit adds code to print the grace-period number at the start
of the test along with both the grace-period number and the number of
elapsed grace periods at the end of the test.  Note that variants of
RCU)without the notion of a grace-period number (for example, Tiny RCU)
just print zeroes.
