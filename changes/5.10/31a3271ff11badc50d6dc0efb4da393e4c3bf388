scsi: qla2xxx: Handle incorrect entry_type entries

It was observed on an ISP8324 16Gb HBA with fw=8.08.203 (d0d5) in a
PowerPC64 machine that pkt->entry_type was MBX_IOCB_TYPE/0x39 with an
sp->type SRB_SCSI_CMD which is invalid and should not be possible.

Reading the entry_type from the crash dump shows the expected value of
STATUS_TYPE/0x03 but the call trace shows that qla24xx_mbx_iocb_entry() is
used.

Add a check to verify for consistency and reset the HBA if an invalid state
is reached. Obviously, this is only a workaround until the real problem is
solved.
