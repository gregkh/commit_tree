firmware: psci: Extend psci_set_osi_mode() to allow reset to PC mode

The current user (cpuidle-psci) of psci_set_osi_mode() only needs to enable
the PSCI OSI mode. Although, as subsequent changes shows, there is a need
to be able to reset back into the PSCI PC mode.

Therefore, let's extend psci_set_osi_mode() to take a bool as in-parameter,
to let the user indicate whether to enable OSI or to switch back to PC
mode.
