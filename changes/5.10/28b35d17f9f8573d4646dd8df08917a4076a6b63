scsi: qedi: Fix list_del corruption while removing active I/O

While aborting the I/O, the firmware cleanup task timed out and driver
deleted the I/O from active command list. Some time later the firmware
sent the cleanup task response and driver again deleted the I/O from
active command list causing firmware to send completion for non-existent
I/O and list_del corruption of active command list.

Add fix to check if I/O is present before deleting it from the active
command list to ensure firmware sends valid I/O completion and protect
against list_del corruption.
