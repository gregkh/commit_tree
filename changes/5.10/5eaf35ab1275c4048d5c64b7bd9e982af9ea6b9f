mm/rmap: fix assumptions of THP size

Ask the page what size it is instead of assuming it's PMD size.  Do this
for anon pages as well as file pages for when someone decides to support
that.  Leave the assumption alone for pages which are PMD mapped; we don't
currently grow THPs beyond PMD size, so we don't need to change this code
yet.
