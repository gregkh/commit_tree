kvm: x86/mmu: Introduce tdp_iter

The TDP iterator implements a pre-order traversal of a TDP paging
structure. This iterator will be used in future patches to create
an efficient implementation of the KVM MMU for the TDP case.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.
