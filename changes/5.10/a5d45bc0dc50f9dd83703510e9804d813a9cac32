netfilter: nftables_offload: build mask based from the matching bytes

Userspace might match on prefix bytes of header fields if they are on
the byte boundary, this requires that the mask is adjusted accordingly.
Use NFT_OFFLOAD_MATCH_EXACT() for meta since prefix byte matching is not
allowed for this type of selector.

The bitwise expression might be optimized out by userspace, hence the
kernel needs to infer the prefix from the number of payload bytes to
match on. This patch adds nft_payload_offload_mask() to calculate the
bitmask to match on the prefix.
