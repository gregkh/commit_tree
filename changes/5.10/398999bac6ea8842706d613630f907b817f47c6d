net/af_iucv: right-size the uid variable in iucv_sock_bind()

smatch complains about
net/iucv/af_iucv.c:624 iucv_sock_bind() error: memcpy() 'sa->siucv_user_id' too small (8 vs 9)

Which is absolutely correct - the memcpy() takes 9 bytes (sizeof(uid))
from an 8-byte field (sa->siucv_user_id).
Luckily the sockaddr_iucv struct contains more data after the
.siucv_user_id field, and we checked the size of the passed data earlier
on. So the memcpy() won't accidentally read from an invalid location.

Fix the warning by reducing the size of the uid variable to what's
actually needed, and thus reducing the amount of copied data.
