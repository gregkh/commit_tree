cx82310_eth: re-enable ethernet mode after router reboot

When the router is rebooted without a power cycle, the USB device
remains connected but its configuration is reset. This results in
a non-working ethernet connection with messages like this in syslog:
	usb 2-2: RX packet too long: 65535 B

Re-enable ethernet mode when receiving a packet with invalid size of
0xffff.
