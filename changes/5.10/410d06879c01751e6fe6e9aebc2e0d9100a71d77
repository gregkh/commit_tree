ice: add the DDP Track ID to devlink info

Add "fw.app.bundle_id" to display the DDP Track ID of the active DDP
package. This id is similar to "fw.bundle_id" and is a unique identifier
for the DDP package that is loaded in the device. Each new DDP has
a unique Track ID generated for it, and the ID can be used to identify
and track the DDP package.

Add documentation for the new devlink info version.
