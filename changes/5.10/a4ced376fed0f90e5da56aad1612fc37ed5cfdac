tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Fix the UART wakeup issue

As a part of system suspend uart_port_suspend is called from the
Serial driver, which calls set_mctrl passing mctrl as 0. This
makes RFR high(NOT_READY) during suspend.

Due to this BT SoC is not able to send wakeup bytes to UART during
suspend. Include if check for non-suspend case to keep RFR low
during suspend.
