iommu/amd: Increase interrupt remapping table limit to 512 entries

Certain device drivers allocate IO queues on a per-cpu basis.
On AMD EPYC platform, which can support up-to 256 cpu threads,
this can exceed the current MAX_IRQ_PER_TABLE limit of 256,
and result in the error message:

    AMD-Vi: Failed to allocate IRTE

This has been observed with certain NVME devices.

AMD IOMMU hardware can actually support upto 512 interrupt
remapping table entries. Therefore, update the driver to
match the hardware limit.

Please note that this also increases the size of interrupt remapping
table to 8KB per device when using the 128-bit IRTE format.
