chelsio/chtls: fix memory leaks caused by a race

race between user context and softirq causing memleak,
consider the call sequence scenario

chtls_setkey()         //user context
chtls_peer_close()
chtls_abort_req_rss()
chtls_setkey()         //user context

work request skb queued in chtls_setkey() won't be freed
because resources are already cleaned for this connection,
fix it by not queuing work request while socket is closing.

v1->v2:
- fix W=1 warning.

v2->v3:
- separate it out from another memleak fix.
