libbpf: Fix compilation warnings for 64-bit printf args

Fix compilation warnings due to __u64 defined differently as `unsigned long`
or `unsigned long long` on different architectures (e.g., ppc64le differs from
x86-64). Also cast one argument to size_t to fix printf warning of similar
nature.

Fixes: 50e09460d9f8 ("libbpf: Skip well-known ELF sections when iterating ELF")
