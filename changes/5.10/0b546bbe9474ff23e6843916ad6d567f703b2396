spi: fsi: Fix clock running too fast

Use a clock divider tuned to a 200MHz FSI bus frequency (the maximum). Use
of the previous divider at 200MHz results in corrupt data from endpoint
devices. Ideally the clock divider would be calculated from the FSI clock,
but that would require some significant work on the FSI driver. With FSI
frequencies slower than 200MHz, the SPI clock will simply run slower, but
safely.
