selftests/powerpc: Make alignment handler test P9N DD2.1 vector CI load workaround

alignment_handler currently only tests the unaligned cases but it can
also be useful for testing the workaround for the P9N DD2.1 vector CI
load issue fixed by p9_hmi_special_emu(). This workaround was
introduced in 5080332c2c89 ("powerpc/64s: Add workaround for P9 vector
CI load issue").

This changes the loop to start from offset 0 rather than 1 so that we
test the kernel emulation in p9_hmi_special_emu().
