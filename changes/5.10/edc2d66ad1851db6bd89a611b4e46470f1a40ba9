bpf: selftest: Use bpf_skc_to_tcp_sock() in the sock_fields test

This test uses bpf_skc_to_tcp_sock() to get a kernel tcp_sock ptr "ktp".
Access the ktp->lsndtime and also pass ktp to bpf_sk_storage_get().

It also exercises the bpf_sk_cgroup_id() and bpf_sk_ancestor_cgroup_id()
with the "ktp".  To do that, a parent cgroup and a child cgroup are
created.  The bpf prog is attached to the child cgroup.
