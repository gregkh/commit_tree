powerpc/32s: Rename head_32.S to head_book3s_32.S

Unlike PPC64 which had a single head_64.S, PPC32 are multiple ones.
There is the head_32.S, selected by default based on the value of BITS
and overridden based on some CONFIG_ values. This leads to thinking
that it may be selected by different types of PPC32 platform but
indeed it ends up being selected by book3s/32 only.

Make that explicit by:
- Not doing any default selection based on BITS.
- Renaming head_32.S to head_book3s_32.S.
- Get head_book3s_32.S selected only by CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S_32.
