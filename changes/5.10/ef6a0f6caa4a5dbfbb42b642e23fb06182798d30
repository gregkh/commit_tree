habanalabs: Add an option to map CB to device MMU

There are cases in which the device should access the host memory of a
CB through the device MMU, and thus this memory should be mapped.
The patch adds a flag to the CB IOCTL, in which a user can ask the
driver to perform the mapping when creating a CB.
The mapping is allowed only if a dedicated VA range was allocated for
the specific ASIC.
