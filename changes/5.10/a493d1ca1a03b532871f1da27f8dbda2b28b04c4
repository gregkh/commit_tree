x86/membarrier: Get rid of a dubious optimization

sync_core_before_usermode() had an incorrect optimization.  If the kernel
returns from an interrupt, it can get to usermode without IRET. It just has
to schedule to a different task in the same mm and do SYSRET.  Fortunately,
there were no callers of sync_core_before_usermode() that could have had
in_irq() or in_nmi() equal to true, because it's only ever called from the
scheduler.

While at it, clarify a related comment.
