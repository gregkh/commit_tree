rcu/trace: Use gp_seq_req in acceleration's rcu_grace_period tracepoint

During acceleration of CB, the rsp's gp_seq is rcu_seq_snap'd. This is
the value used for acceleration - it is the value of gp_seq at which it
is safe the execute all callbacks in the callback list.

The rdp's gp_seq is not very useful for this scenario. Make
rcu_grace_period report the gp_seq_req instead as it allows one to
reason about how the acceleration works.
