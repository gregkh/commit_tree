tracing: Add support for dynamic strings to synthetic events

Currently, sythetic events only support static string fields such as:

  # echo 'test_latency u64 lat; char somename[32]' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events

Which is fine, but wastes a lot of space in the event.

It also prevents the most commonly-defined strings in the existing
trace events e.g. those defined using __string(), from being passed to
synthetic events via the trace() action.

With this change, synthetic events with dynamic fields can be defined:

  # echo 'test_latency u64 lat; char somename[]' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events

And the trace() action can be used to generate events using either
dynamic or static strings:

  # echo 'hist:keys=name:lat=common_timestamp.usecs-$ts0:onmatch(sys.event).test_latency($lat,name)' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events

The synthetic event dynamic strings are implemented in the same way as
the existing __data_loc strings and appear as such in the format file.

[ <rostedt@goodmis.org>: added __set_synth_event_print_fmt() changes:

  I added the following to make it work with trace-cmd. Dynamic strings
  must have __get_str() for events in the print_fmt otherwise it can't be
  parsed correctly. ]
