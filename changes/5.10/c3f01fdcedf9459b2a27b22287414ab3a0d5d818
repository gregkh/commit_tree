xsk: Introduce padding between ring pointers

Introduce one cache line worth of padding between the producer and
consumer pointers in all the lockless rings. This so that the HW
adjacency prefetcher will not prefetch the consumer pointer when the
producer pointer is used and vice versa. This improves throughput
performance for the l2fwd sample app with 2% on my machine with HW
prefetching turned on.
