drm/i915: Initialise outparam for error return from wait_for_register

Just in case the caller passes in 0 for both slow&fast timeouts, make
sure we initialise the stack value returned. Add an assert so that we
don't make the mistake of passing 0 timeouts for the wait.

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_uncore.c:2011 __intel_wait_for_register_fw() error: uninitialized symbol 'reg_value'.
