drm/amd/display: Avoid using unvalidated tiling_flags and tmz_surface in prepare_planes

[Why]
We're racing with userspace as the flags could potentially change
from when we acquired and validated them in commit_check.

[How]
We unfortunately can't drop this function in its entirety from
prepare_planes since we don't know the afb->address at commit_check
time yet.

So instead of querying new tiling_flags and tmz_surface use the ones
from the plane_state directly.

While we're at it, also update the force_disable_dcc option based
on the state from atomic check.
