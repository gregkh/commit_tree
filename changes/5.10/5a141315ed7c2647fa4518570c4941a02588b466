The pm80xx driver currently sets the controller queue depth to
256. Hoewver, the controller supports outstanding I/Os up 1024.

Increase the number of outstanding I/Os from 256 to 1024.  CCBs and tags
are allocated according to outstanding I/Os. Also update the can_queue
value (max_out_io - PM8001_RESERVE_SLOT) used by the SCSI midlayer.
