ARM: s3c24xx: move s3cmci pinctrl handling into board files

Rather than call the internal s3c_gpio_cfgall_range() function
through a platform header, move the code into the set_power
callback that is already exported by the board, and add
a default implementation.

In DT mode, the code already does not set the pin config,
so nothing changes there.
