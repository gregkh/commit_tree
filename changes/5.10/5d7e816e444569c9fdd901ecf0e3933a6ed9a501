dmaengine: Save few bytes and increase readability of dma_request_chan()

Split IS_ERR_OR_NULL() check followed by additional conditional
to two simple conditionals. This increases readability and saves memory:

Function                                     old     new   delta
dma_request_chan                             700     697      -3
Total: Before=10224, After=10221, chg -0.03%
