io_uring: kill ref get/drop in personality init

Don't take an identity on personality/creds init only to drop it a few
lines after. Extract a function which prepares req->work but leaves it
without identity.

Note: it's safe to not check REQ_F_WORK_INITIALIZED there because it's
nobody had a chance to init it before io_init_req().
