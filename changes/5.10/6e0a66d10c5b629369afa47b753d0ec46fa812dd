arm64/build: Remove .eh_frame* sections due to unwind tables

Avoid .eh_frame* section generation by making sure both CFLAGS and AFLAGS
contain -fno-asychronous-unwind-tables and -fno-unwind-tables.

With all sources of .eh_frame now removed from the build, drop this
DISCARD so we can be alerted in the future if it returns unexpectedly
once orphan section warnings have been enabled.
