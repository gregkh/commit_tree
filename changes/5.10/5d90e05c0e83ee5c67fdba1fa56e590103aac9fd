test_firmware: Test partial read support

Add additional hooks to test_firmware to pass in support
for partial file read using request_firmware_into_buf():

	buf_size: size of buffer to request firmware into
	partial: indicates that a partial file request is being made
	file_offset: to indicate offset into file to request

Also update firmware selftests to use the new partial read test API.
