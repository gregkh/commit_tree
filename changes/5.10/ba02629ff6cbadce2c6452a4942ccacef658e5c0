bnxt_en: log firmware status on firmware init failure

Firmware now supports device independent discovery of the status
register location. This status register can provide more detailed
information about firmware errors, especially if problems occur
before the HWRM interface is functioning. Attempt to map this
register if it is present and report the firmware status on firmware
init failures.
