xsk: Rearrange internal structs for better performance

Rearrange the xdp_sock, xdp_umem and xsk_buff_pool structures so
that they get smaller and align better to the cache lines. In the
previous commits of this patch set, these structs have been
reordered with the focus on functionality and simplicity, not
performance. This patch improves throughput performance by around
3%.
