net: mdiobus: Remove WARN_ON_ONCE(in_interrupt())

in_interrupt() is ill defined and does not provide what the name
suggests. The usage especially in driver code is deprecated and a tree wide
effort to clean up and consolidate the (ab)usage of in_interrupt() and
related checks is happening.

In this case the check covers only parts of the contexts in which these
functions cannot be called. It fails to detect preemption or interrupt
disabled invocations.

As the functions which contain these warnings invoke mutex_lock() which
contains a broad variety of checks (always enabled or debug option
dependent) and therefore covers all invalid conditions already, there is no
point in having inconsistent warnings in those drivers. The conditional
return is not really valuable in practice either.

Just remove them.
