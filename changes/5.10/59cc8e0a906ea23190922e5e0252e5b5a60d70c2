module: Properly propagate MODULE_STATE_COMING failure

Now that notifiers got unbroken; use the proper interface to handle
notifier errors and propagate them.

There were already MODULE_STATE_COMING notifiers that failed; notably:

 - jump_label_module_notifier()
 - tracepoint_module_notify()
 - bpf_event_notify()

By propagating this error, we fix those users.
