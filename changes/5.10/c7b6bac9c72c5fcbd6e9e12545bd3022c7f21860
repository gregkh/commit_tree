drm, iommu: Change type of pasid to u32

PASID is defined as a few different types in iommu including "int",
"u32", and "unsigned int". To be consistent and to match with uapi
definitions, define PASID and its variations (e.g. max PASID) as "u32".
"u32" is also shorter and a little more explicit than "unsigned int".

No PASID type change in uapi although it defines PASID as __u64 in
some places.
