drm/amd/display: Detect plane change when detect pipe change.

[Why]
If plane has changed, dcn20_detect_pipe_changes doesn't update dc_plane_state->update_flags, and the following dcn20_program_pipe can't reprogram hubp correctly.

[How]
Add a new flags bit "plane_changed" in pipe_ctx->update_flags.If old plane isn’t identical to new plane, this bit will be set and guide “dcn20_program_pipe” to programing HUBP correctly.
