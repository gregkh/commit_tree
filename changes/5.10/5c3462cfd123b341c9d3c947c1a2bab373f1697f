io_uring: store io_identity in io_uring_task

This is, by definition, a per-task structure. So store it in the
task context, instead of doing carrying it in each io_kiocb. We're being
a bit inefficient if members have changed, as that requires an alloc and
copy of a new io_identity struct. The next patch will fix that up.
