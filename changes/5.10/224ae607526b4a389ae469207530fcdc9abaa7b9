mei: bus: unconditionally enable clients with vtag support

The list of clients is only visible via mei client bus.
Enabling vtag clients on the mei client bus allows user-space to
enumerate clients with vtag support by traversing the mei bus on sysfs.
This feature is required for ACRN device model service.
