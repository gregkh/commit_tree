x86/boot/compressed: Get rid of GOT fixup code

In a previous patch, we have eliminated GOT entries from the decompressor
binary and added an assertion that the .got section is empty. This means
that the GOT fixup routines that exist in both the 32-bit and 64-bit
startup routines have become dead code, and can be removed.

While at it, drop the KEEP() from the linker script, as it has no effect
on the contents of output sections that are created by the linker itself.
