x86/mce: Provide method to find out the type of an exception handler

Avoid a proliferation of ex_has_*_handler() functions by having just
one function that returns the type of the handler (if any).

Drop the __visible attribute for this function. It is not called
from assembler so the attribute is not necessary.
