ARM: dts: s5pv210: add RTC 32 KHz clock in Aries family

The S3C RTC requires 32768 Hz clock as input which is provided by PMIC.
However there is no such clock provider but rather a regulator driver
which registers the clock as a regulator.  This is an old driver which
will not be updated so add a workaround - a fixed-clock to fill missing
clock phandle reference in S3C RTC.

This fixes dtbs_check warnings:

  rtc@e2800000: clocks: [[2, 145]] is too short
  rtc@e2800000: clock-names: ['rtc'] is too short
