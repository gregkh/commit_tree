scripts: get_abi.pl: auto-generate cross references

There are several cross-references that can be automatically
generated:

	- References to .rst files inside Documentation/
	- References to other ABI files;
	- References to ABI symbols at /sys/*.

Add a logic to automatically parse them and convert into
cross references.
