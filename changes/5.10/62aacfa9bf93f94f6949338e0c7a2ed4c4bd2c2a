media: v4l2: extend the CSC API to subdevice.

This patch extends the CSC API in video devices to be supported
also on sub-devices. The flag V4L2_MBUS_FRAMEFMT_SET_CSC set by
the application when calling VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT ioctl.
The flags:

V4L2_SUBDEV_MBUS_CODE_CSC_COLORSPACE,
V4L2_SUBDEV_MBUS_CODE_CSC_XFER_FUNC,
V4L2_SUBDEV_MBUS_CODE_CSC_YCBCR_ENC/V4L2_SUBDEV_MBUS_CODE_CSC_HSV_ENC
V4L2_SUBDEV_MBUS_CODE_CSC_QUANTIZATION

are set by the driver in the VIDIOC_SUBDEV_ENUM_MBUS_CODE ioctl.

New 'flags' fields were added to the structs
v4l2_subdev_mbus_code_enum, v4l2_mbus_framefmt which are borrowed
from the 'reserved' field

The patch also replaces the 'ycbcr_enc' field in
'struct v4l2_mbus_framefmt' with a union that includes 'hsv_enc'
