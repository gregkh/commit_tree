vhost: add helper to check if a vq has been setup

This adds a helper check if a vq has been setup. The next patches
will use this when we move the vhost scsi cmd preallocation from per
session to per vq. In the per vq case, we only want to allocate cmds
for vqs that have actually been setup and not for all the possible
vqs.
