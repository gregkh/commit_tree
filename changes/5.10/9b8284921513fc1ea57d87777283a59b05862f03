io_uring: reference ->nsproxy for file table commands

If we don't get and assign the namespace for the async work, then certain
paths just don't work properly (like /dev/stdin, /proc/mounts, etc).
Anything that references the current namespace of the given task should
be assigned for async work on behalf of that task.
