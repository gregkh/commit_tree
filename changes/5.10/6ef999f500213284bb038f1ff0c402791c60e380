RDMA/bnxt_re: Use rdma_umem_for_each_dma_block()

This driver is taking the SGL out of the umem and passing it through a
struct bnxt_qplib_sg_info. Instead of passing the SGL pass the umem and
then use rdma_umem_for_each_dma_block() directly.

Move the calls of ib_umem_num_dma_blocks() closer to their actual point of
use, npages is only set for non-umem pbl flows.
