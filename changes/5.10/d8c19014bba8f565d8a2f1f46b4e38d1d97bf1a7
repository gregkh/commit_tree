page_frag: Recover from memory pressure

The ethernet driver may allocate skb (and skb->data) via napi_alloc_skb().
This ends up to page_frag_alloc() to allocate skb->data from
page_frag_cache->va.

During the memory pressure, page_frag_cache->va may be allocated as
pfmemalloc page. As a result, the skb->pfmemalloc is always true as
skb->data is from page_frag_cache->va. The skb will be dropped if the
sock (receiver) does not have SOCK_MEMALLOC. This is expected behaviour
under memory pressure.

However, once kernel is not under memory pressure any longer (suppose large
amount of memory pages are just reclaimed), the page_frag_alloc() may still
re-use the prior pfmemalloc page_frag_cache->va to allocate skb->data. As a
result, the skb->pfmemalloc is always true unless page_frag_cache->va is
re-allocated, even if the kernel is not under memory pressure any longer.

Here is how kernel runs into issue.

1. The kernel is under memory pressure and allocation of
PAGE_FRAG_CACHE_MAX_ORDER in __page_frag_cache_refill() will fail. Instead,
the pfmemalloc page is allocated for page_frag_cache->va.

2: All skb->data from page_frag_cache->va (pfmemalloc) will have
skb->pfmemalloc=true. The skb will always be dropped by sock without
SOCK_MEMALLOC. This is an expected behaviour.

3. Suppose a large amount of pages are reclaimed and kernel is not under
memory pressure any longer. We expect skb->pfmemalloc drop will not happen.

4. Unfortunately, page_frag_alloc() does not proactively re-allocate
page_frag_alloc->va and will always re-use the prior pfmemalloc page. The
skb->pfmemalloc is always true even kernel is not under memory pressure any
longer.

Fix this by freeing and re-allocating the page instead of recycling it.
