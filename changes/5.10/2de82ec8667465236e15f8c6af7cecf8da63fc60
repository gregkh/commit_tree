dt-bindings: pci: rcar-pci-ep: Document r8a774a1 and r8a774b1

Document the support for R-Car PCIe EP on R8A774A1 and R8A774B1 SoC
devices.

Also constify "renesas,rcar-gen3-pcie-ep" so that it can be used as
fallback compatible string for R-Car Gen3 and RZ/G2 devices as the
PCIe module is identical.
