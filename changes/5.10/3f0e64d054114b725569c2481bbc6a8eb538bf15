io_uring: move SQPOLL post-wakeup ring need wakeup flag into wake handler

We need to decouple the clearing on wakeup from the the inline schedule,
as that is going to be required for handling multiple rings in one
thread.

Wrap our wakeup handler so we can clear it when we get the wakeup, by
definition that is when we no longer need the flag set.
