drm/vc4: gem: Add a managed action to cleanup the job queue

The job queue needs to be cleaned up using vc4_gem_destroy, but it's
not used consistently (vc4_drv's bind calls it in its error path, but
doesn't in unbind), and we can make that automatic through a managed
action. Let's remove the requirement to call vc4_gem_destroy.
