dmaengine: dma-jz4780: Fix race in jz4780_dma_tx_status

The jz4780_dma_tx_status() function would check if a channel's cookie
state was set to 'completed', and if not, it would enter the critical
section. However, in that time frame, the jz4780_dma_chan_irq() function
was able to set the cookie to 'completed', and clear the jzchan->vchan
pointer, which was deferenced in the critical section of the first
function.

Fix this race by checking the channel's cookie state after entering the
critical function and not before.
