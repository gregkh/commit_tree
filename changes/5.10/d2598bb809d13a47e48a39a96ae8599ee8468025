RDMA/qib: Remove superfluous fallthrough statements

Commit 36a8f01cd24b ("IB/qib: Add congestion control agent
implementation") erroneously marked a couple of switch cases as /*
FALLTHROUGH */, which were later converted to fallthrough statements by
commit df561f6688fe ("treewide: Use fallthrough pseudo-keyword"). This
triggered a Coverity warning about unreachable code.

Remove the fallthrough statements.
