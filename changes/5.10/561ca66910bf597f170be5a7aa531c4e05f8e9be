tracing: Make -ENOMEM the default error for parse_synth_field()

parse_synth_field() returns a pointer and requires that errors get
surrounded by ERR_PTR(). The ret variable is initialized to zero, but should
never be used as zero, and if it is, it could cause a false return code and
produce a NULL pointer dereference. It makes no sense to set ret to zero.

Set ret to -ENOMEM (the most common error case), and have any other errors
set it to something else. This removes the need to initialize ret on *every*
error branch.
