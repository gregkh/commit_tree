drm/vc4: hdmi: Remove register dumps in enable

The current code has some logic, disabled by default, to dump the register
setup in the HDMI controller.

However, since we're going to split those functions in multiple, shorter,
functions that only make sense where they are called in sequence, keeping
the register dump makes little sense.
