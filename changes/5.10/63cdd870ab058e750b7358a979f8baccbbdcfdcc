crypto: inside-secure - Reuse code in safexcel_hmac_alg_setkey

The code in the current implementation of safexcel_hmac_alg_setkey
can be reused by safexcel_cipher.  This patch does just that by
renaming the previous safexcel_hmac_setkey to __safexcel_hmac_setkey.
The now-shared safexcel_hmac_alg_setkey becomes safexcel_hmac_setkey
and a new safexcel_hmac_alg_setkey has been added for use by ahash
transforms.

As a result safexcel_aead_setkey's stack frame has been reduced by
about half in size, or about 512 bytes.
