r8169: disable hw csum for short packets on all chip versions

RTL8125B has same or similar short packet hw padding bug as RTL8168evl.
The main workaround has been extended accordingly, however we have to
disable also hw checksumming for short packets on affected new chip
versions. Instead of checking for an affected chip version let's
simply disable hw checksumming for short packets in general.

v2:
- remove the version checks and disable short packet hw csum in general
- reflect this in commit title and message
