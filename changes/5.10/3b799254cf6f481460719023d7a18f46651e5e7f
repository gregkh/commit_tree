Bluetooth: hci_uart: Cancel init work before unregistering

If hci_uart_tty_close() or hci_uart_unregister_device() is called while
hu->init_ready is scheduled, hci_register_dev() could be called after
the hci_uart is torn down. Avoid this by ensuring the work is complete
or canceled before checking the HCI_UART_REGISTERED flag.
