net: libertas: Use netif_rx_any_context()

The usage of in_interrupt() in non-core code is phased out. Ideally the
information of the calling context should be passed by the callers or the
functions be split as appropriate.

libertas uses in_interupt() to select the netif_rx*() variant which matches
the calling context. The attempt to consolidate the code by passing an
arguemnt or by distangling it failed due lack of knowledge about this
driver and because the call chains are hard to follow.

As a stop gap use netif_rx_any_context() which invokes the correct code
path depending on context and confines the in_interrupt() usage to core
code.
