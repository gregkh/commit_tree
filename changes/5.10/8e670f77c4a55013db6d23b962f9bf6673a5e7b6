Handle STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT gracefully

Currently STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT is not treated as retriable error.
It is currently mapped to ETIMEDOUT and returned to userspace
for most system calls. STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT is returned by server
in case of unavailability or throttling errors.

This patch will map the STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT to EAGAIN, so that it
can be retried. Also, added a check to drop the connection to
not overload the server in case of ongoing unavailability.
