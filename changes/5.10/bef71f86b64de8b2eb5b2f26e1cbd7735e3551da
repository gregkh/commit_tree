selftests/seccomp: Allow syscall nr and ret value to be set separately

In preparation for setting syscall nr and ret values separately, refactor
the helpers to take a pointer to a value, so that a NULL can indicate
"do not change this respective value". This is done to keep the regset
read/write happening once and in one code path.
