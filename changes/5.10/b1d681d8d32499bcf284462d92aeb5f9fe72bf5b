interconnect: Add sync state support

The bootloaders often do some initial configuration of the interconnects
in the system and we want to keep this configuration until all consumers
have probed and expressed their bandwidth needs. This is because we don't
want to change the configuration by starting to disable unused paths until
every user had a chance to request the amount of bandwidth it needs.

To accomplish this we will implement an interconnect specific sync_state
callback which will synchronize (aggregate and set) the current bandwidth
settings when all consumers have been probed.
