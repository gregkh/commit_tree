usb: dwc3: gadget: Allow restarting a transfer

It's possible that there's no new TRBs prepared when kicking a transfer.
This happens when we need to stop and restart a transfer such as in the
case of reinitiating a stream or retrying isoc transfer. For streams,
sometime host may reject a stream and the device may need to reinitiate
that stream by stopping and restarting a transfer. In this case, all the
TRBs may have already been prepared. Allow the function
__dwc3_gadget_kick_transfer() to go through even though there's no new
TRB.
