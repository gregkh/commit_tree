net: dsa: microchip: Implement recommended reset timing

The datasheet for the ksz9893 and ksz9477 switches recommend waiting at
least 100us after the de-assertion of reset before trying to program the
device through any interface.

Also switch the existing msleep() call to usleep_range() as recommended
in Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst. The 2ms range used here is
somewhat arbitrary, as long as the reset is asserted for at least 10ms
we should be ok.
