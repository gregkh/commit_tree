coresight: etm4x: Fix save and restore of TRCVMIDCCTLR1 register

In commit f188b5e76aae ("coresight: etm4x: Save/restore state
across CPU low power states"), mistakenly TRCVMIDCCTLR1 register
value was saved in trcvmidcctlr0 state variable which is used to
store TRCVMIDCCTLR0 register value in etm4x_cpu_save() and then
same value is written back to both TRCVMIDCCTLR0 and TRCVMIDCCTLR1
in etm4x_cpu_restore(). There is already a trcvmidcctlr1 state
variable available for TRCVMIDCCTLR1, so use it.
