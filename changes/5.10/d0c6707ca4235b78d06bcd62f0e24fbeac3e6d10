arm64: dts: allwinner: H5: NanoPi Neo Plus2: phy-mode rgmii-id

Since commit bbc4d71d6354 ("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e rx/tx
delay config") network is broken on the NanoPi Neo Plus2.

This patch changes the phy-mode to use internal delays both for RX and TX
as has been done for other boards affected by the same commit.
