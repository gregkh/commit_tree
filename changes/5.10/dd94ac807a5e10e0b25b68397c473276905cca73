perf test: Update branch sample pattern for cs-etm

Since the commit 943b69ac1884 ("perf parse-events: Set exclude_guest=1
for user-space counting"), 'exclude_guest=1' is set for user-space
counting; and the branch sample's modifier has been altered, the sample
event name has been changed from "branches:u:" to "branches:uH:", which
gives out info for "user-space and host counting".

But the cs-etm testing's regular expression cannot match the updated
branch sample event and leads to test failure.

This patch updates the branch sample pattern by using a more flexible
expression '.*' to match branch sample's modifiers, so that allows the
testing to work as expected.
