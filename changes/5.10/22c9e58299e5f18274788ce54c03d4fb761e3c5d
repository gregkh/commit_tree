ARM: 8997/2: hw_breakpoint: Handle inexact watchpoint addresses

This is commit fdfeff0f9e3d ("arm64: hw_breakpoint: Handle inexact
watchpoint addresses") but ported to arm32, which has the same
problem.

This problem was found by Android CTS tests, notably the
"watchpoint_imprecise" test [1].  I tested locally against a copycat
(simplified) version of the test though.
