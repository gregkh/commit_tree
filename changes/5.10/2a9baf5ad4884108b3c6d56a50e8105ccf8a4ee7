x86/debug: Fix BTF handling

The SDM states that #DB clears DEBUGCTLMSR_BTF, this means that when the
bit is set for userspace (TIF_BLOCKSTEP) and a kernel #DB happens first,
the BTF bit meant for userspace execution is lost.

Have the kernel #DB handler restore the BTF bit when it was requested
for userspace.
