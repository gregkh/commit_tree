xen/events: use a common cpu hotplug hook for event channels

Today only fifo event channels have a cpu hotplug callback. In order
to prepare for more percpu (de)init work move that callback into
events_base.c and add percpu_init() and percpu_deinit() hooks to
struct evtchn_ops.

This is part of XSA-332.
