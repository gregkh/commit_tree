KVM: selftests: Remove address rounding in guest code

Rounding the address the guest writes to a host page boundary
will only have an effect if the host page size is larger than the guest
page size, but in that case the guest write would still go to the same
host page. There's no reason to round the address down, so remove the
rounding to simplify the demand paging test.

This series was tested by running the following invocations on an Intel
Skylake machine:
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20m -i 100 -v 64
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20g -i 5 -v 4
dirty_log_perf_test -b 4g -i 5 -v 32
demand_paging_test -b 20m -v 64
demand_paging_test -b 20g -v 4
demand_paging_test -b 4g -v 32
All behaved as expected.
