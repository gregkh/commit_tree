ASoC: sun50i-codec-analog: Gate the amplifier clock during suspend

The clock must be running for the zero-crossing mute functionality.
However, it must be gated for VDD-SYS to be turned off during system
suspend. Disable it in the suspend callback, after everything has
already been muted, to avoid pops when muting/unmuting outputs.
