blk-mq: docs: add kernel-doc description for a new struct member

As reported by kernel-doc:
	./include/linux/blk-mq.h:267: warning: Function parameter or member 'active_queues_shared_sbitmap' not described in 'blk_mq_tag_set'

There is now a new member for struct blk_mq_tag_set. Add a
description for it, based on the commit that introduced it.

Fixes: f1b49fdc1c64 ("blk-mq: Record active_queues_shared_sbitmap per tag_set for when using shared sbitmap")
