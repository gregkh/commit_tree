x86/irq: Cleanup the arch_*_msi_irqs() leftovers

Get rid of all the gunk and remove the 'select PCI_MSI_ARCH_FALLBACK' from
the x86 Kconfig so the weak functions in the PCI core are replaced by stubs
which emit a warning, which ensures that any fail to set the irq domain
pointer results in a warning when the device is used.
