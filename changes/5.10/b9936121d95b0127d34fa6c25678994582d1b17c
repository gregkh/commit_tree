drm/i915/dp: Extract drm_dp_read_dpcd_caps()

Since DP 1.3, it's been possible for DP receivers to specify an
additional set of DPCD capabilities, which can take precedence over the
capabilities reported at DP_DPCD_REV.

Basically any device supporting DP is going to need to read these in an
identical manner, in particular nouveau, so let's go ahead and just move
this code out of i915 into a shared DRM DP helper that we can use in
other drivers.

v2:
* Remove redundant dpcd[DP_DPCD_REV] == 0 check
* Fix drm_dp_dpcd_read() ret checks
