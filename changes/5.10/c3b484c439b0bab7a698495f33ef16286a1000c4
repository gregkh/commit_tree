x86/syscalls: Document the fact that syscalls 512-547 are a legacy mistake

Since this commit:

  6365b842aae4 ("x86/syscalls: Split the x32 syscalls into their own table")

there is no need for special x32-specific syscall numbers.  I forgot to
update the comments in syscall_64.tbl.  Add comments to make it clear to
future contributors that this range is a legacy wart.
