io_uring: show sqthread pid and cpu in fdinfo

In most cases we'll specify IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL and run multiple
io_uring instances in a host. Since all sqthreads are named
"io_uring-sq", it's hard to distinguish the relations between
application process and its io_uring sqthread.
With this patch, application can get its corresponding sqthread pid
and cpu through show_fdinfo.
Steps:
1. Get io_uring fd first.
$ ls -l /proc/<pid>/fd | grep -w io_uring
2. Then get io_uring instance related info, including corresponding
sqthread pid and cpu.
$ cat /proc/<pid>/fdinfo/<io_uring_fd>
