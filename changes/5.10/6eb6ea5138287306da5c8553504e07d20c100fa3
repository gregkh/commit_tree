ath11k: add board file support for PCI devices

PCI devices like QCA6390 load the board file differently, add support for that
and the method is chosen using bus_params variables.

Add support to create board name for different targets.  This board name is
used to parse the board data from board-2.bin for ahb/pci based targets.

As struct target_mem_chunk::vaddr was changed from 'u32' to 'u32 *' in
ath11k_qmi_assign_target_mem_chunk() vaddr assignments were changed to NULL to
avoid a compilation warning. IPQ8074 does not use the vaddr field for anything
so that change does not affect functionality.

At the moment this only supports board files with BIN type. Support for ELF
type, which seems to be more popular on QCA6390 devices, needs to be added later.

Tested-on: QCA6390 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HST.1.0.1-01740-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1
Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.1.0.1-01238-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-2
