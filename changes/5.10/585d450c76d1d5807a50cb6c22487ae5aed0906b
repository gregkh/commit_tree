drm/amd/display: Refactor to prevent crtc state access in DM IRQ handler

[Why&How]
Currently commit_tail holds global locks and wait for dependencies which is
against the DRM API contracts. Inorder to fix this, IRQ handler should be able
to run without having to access crtc state. Required parameters are copied over
so that they can be directly accessed from the interrupt handler
