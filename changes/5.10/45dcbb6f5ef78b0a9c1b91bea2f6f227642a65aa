kunit: test: add test plan to KUnit TAP format

TAP 14 allows an optional test plan to be emitted before the start of
the start of testing[1]; this is valuable because it makes it possible
for a test harness to detect whether the number of tests run matches the
number of tests expected to be run, ensuring that no tests silently
failed.
