thunderbolt: Do not change default USB4 router notification timeout

Some early stage USB4 devices do not like that any of the enumerating
router config space fields (ROUTER_CS_1 - ROUTER_CS_4) are written after
the initial enumeration for example when entering sleep states. The
default timeout by the USB4 spec is 10 ms which should be fine for the
driver to handle.

For this reason do not change the notification timeout from the default
10 ms for USB4 routers.
