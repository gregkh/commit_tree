USB: quirks: Add USB_QUIRK_DISCONNECT_SUSPEND quirk for Lenovo A630Z TIO built-in usb-audio card

Add a USB_QUIRK_DISCONNECT_SUSPEND quirk for the Lenovo TIO built-in
usb-audio. when A630Z going into S3,the system immediately wakeup 7-8
seconds later by usb-audio disconnect interrupt to avoids the issue.
eg dmesg:
....
[  626.974091 ] usb 7-1.1: USB disconnect, device number 3
....
....
[ 1774.486691] usb 7-1.1: new full-speed USB device number 5 using xhci_hcd
[ 1774.947742] usb 7-1.1: New USB device found, idVendor=17ef, idProduct=a012, bcdDevice= 0.55
[ 1774.956588] usb 7-1.1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[ 1774.964339] usb 7-1.1: Product: Thinkcentre TIO24Gen3 for USB-audio
[ 1774.970999] usb 7-1.1: Manufacturer: Lenovo
[ 1774.975447] usb 7-1.1: SerialNumber: 000000000000
[ 1775.048590] usb 7-1.1: 2:1: cannot get freq at ep 0x1
.......
Seeking a better fix, we've tried a lot of things, including:
 - Check that the device's power/wakeup is disabled
 - Check that remote wakeup is off at the USB level
 - All the quirks in drivers/usb/core/quirks.c
   e.g. USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME,
        USB_QUIRK_RESET,
        USB_QUIRK_IGNORE_REMOTE_WAKEUP,
        USB_QUIRK_NO_LPM.

but none of that makes any difference.

There are no errors in the logs showing any suspend/resume-related issues.
When the system wakes up due to the modem, log-wise it appears to be a
normal resume.

Introduce a quirk to disable the port during suspend when the modem is
detected.
