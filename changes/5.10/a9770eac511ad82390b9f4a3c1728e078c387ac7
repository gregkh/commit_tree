net: mdio: Move MDIO drivers into a new subdirectory

Move all the MDIO drivers and multiplexers into drivers/net/mdio.  The
mdio core is however left in the phy directory, due to mutual
dependencies between the MDIO core and the PHY core.

Take this opportunity to sort the Kconfig based on the menuconfig
strings, and move the multiplexers to the end with a separating
comment.
