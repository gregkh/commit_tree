staging: vchiq: Fix list_for_each exit tests

After a list_for_each_entry() loop, the list iterator is always non-NULL
so these conditions don't work.  If the "waiter" is not found then this
results in an out of bounds access.

I have fixed it by introducing a new "found" variable.  In one case, I
used an else statement for readability.
