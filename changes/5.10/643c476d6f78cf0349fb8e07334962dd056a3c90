nvme: use queuedata for nvme_req_qid

The request's rq_disk isn't set for passthrough IO commands, so tracing
uses qid 0 for these which incorrectly decodes as an admin command. Use
the request_queue's queuedata instead since that value is always set for
the IO queues, and never set for the admin queue.
