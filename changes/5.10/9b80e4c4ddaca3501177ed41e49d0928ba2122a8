overflow: Add __must_check attribute to check_*() helpers

Since the destination variable of the check_*_overflow() helpers will
contain a wrapped value on failure, it would be best to make sure callers
really did check the return result of the helper. Adjust the macros to use
a bool-wrapping static inline that is marked with __must_check. This means
the macros can continue to have their type-agnostic behavior while gaining
the function attribute (that cannot be applied directly to macros).
