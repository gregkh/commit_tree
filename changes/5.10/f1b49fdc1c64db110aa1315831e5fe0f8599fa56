blk-mq: Record active_queues_shared_sbitmap per tag_set for when using shared sbitmap

For when using a shared sbitmap, no longer should the number of active
request queues per hctx be relied on for when judging how to share the tag
bitmap.

Instead maintain the number of active request queues per tag_set, and make
the judgement based on that.
