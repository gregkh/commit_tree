gfs2: Upgrade shared glocks for atime updates

Commit 20f829999c38 ("gfs2: Rework read and page fault locking") lifted
the glock lock taking from the low-level ->readpage and ->readahead
address space operations to the higher-level ->read_iter file and
->fault vm operations.  The glocks are still taken in LM_ST_SHARED mode
only.  On filesystems mounted without the noatime option, ->read_iter
sometimes needs to update the atime as well, though.  Right now, this
leads to a failed locking mode assertion in gfs2_dirty_inode.

Fix that by introducing a new update_time inode operation.  There, if
the glock is held non-exclusively, upgrade it to an exclusive lock.
