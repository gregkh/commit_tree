perf c2c: Display the total numbers continuously

To view the statistics with "breakdown" mode, it's good to show the
summary numbers for the total records, all stores and all loads, then
the sequential conlumns can be used to break into more detailed items.

To achieve this purpose, this patch displays the summary numbers for
records/stores/loads continuously and places them before breakdown
items, this can allow uses to easily read the summarized statistics.
