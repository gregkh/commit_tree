fuse: Allow fuse_fill_super_common() for submounts

Submounts have their own superblock, which needs to be initialized.
However, they do not have a fuse_fs_context associated with them, and
the root node's attributes should be taken from the mountpoint's node.

Extend fuse_fill_super_common() to work for submounts by making the @ctx
parameter optional, and by adding a @submount_finode parameter.

(There is a plain "unsigned" in an existing code block that is being
indented by this commit.  Extend it to "unsigned int" so checkpatch does
not complain.)
