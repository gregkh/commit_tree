tools kvm headers: Update KVM headers from the kernel sources

Some should cause changes in tooling, like the one adding LAST_EXCP, but
the way it is structured end up not making that happen.

The new SVM_EXIT_INVPCID should get used by arch/x86/util/kvm-stat.c,
in the svm_exit_reasons table.

The tools/perf/trace/beauty part has scripts to catch changes and
automagically create tables, like tools/perf/trace/beauty/kvm_ioctl.sh,
but changes are needed to make tools/perf/arch/x86/util/kvm-stat.c catch
those automatically.

These were handled by the existing scripts:

  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/kvm_ioctl.sh > before
  $ cp include/uapi/linux/kvm.h tools/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h
  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/kvm_ioctl.sh > after
