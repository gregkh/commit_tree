x86/boot/compressed: Remove, discard, or assert for unwanted sections

In preparation for warning on orphan sections, stop the linker from
generating the .eh_frame* sections, discard unwanted non-zero-sized
generated sections, and enforce other expected-to-be-zero-sized sections
(since discarding them might hide problems with them suddenly gaining
unexpected entries).
