libbpf: Remove any use of reallocarray() in libbpf

Re-implement glibc's reallocarray() for libbpf internal-only use.
reallocarray(), unfortunately, is not available in all versions of glibc, so
requires extra feature detection and using reallocarray() stub from
<tools/libc_compat.h> and COMPAT_NEED_REALLOCARRAY. All this complicates build
of libbpf unnecessarily and is just a maintenance burden. Instead, it's
trivial to implement libbpf-specific internal version and use it throughout
libbpf.

Which is what this patch does, along with converting some realloc() uses that
should really have been reallocarray() in the first place.
