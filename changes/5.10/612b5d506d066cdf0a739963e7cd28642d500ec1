cper,edac,efi: Memory Error Record: bank group/address and chip id

Updates to the UEFI 2.8 Memory Error Record allow splitting the bank field
into bank address and bank group, and using the last 3 bits of the extended
field as a chip identifier.

When needed, print correct version of bank field, bank group, and chip
identification.

Based on UEFI 2.8 Table 299. Memory Error Record.
