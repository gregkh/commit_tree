btrfs: introduce BTRFS_NESTING_NEW_ROOT for adding new roots

The way we add new roots is confusing from a locking perspective for
lockdep.  We generally have the rule that we lock things in order from
highest level to lowest, but in the case of adding a new level to the
tree we actually allocate a new block for the root, which makes the
locking go in reverse.  A similar issue exists for snapshotting, we cow
the original root for the root of a new tree, however they're at the
same level.  Address this by using BTRFS_NESTING_NEW_ROOT for these
operations.
