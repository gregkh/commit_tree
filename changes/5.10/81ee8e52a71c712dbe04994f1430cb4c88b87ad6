iomap: Change calling convention for zeroing

Pass the full length to iomap_zero() and dax_iomap_zero(), and have
them return how many bytes they actually handled.  This is preparatory
work for handling THP, although it looks like DAX could actually take
advantage of it if there's a larger contiguous area.
