jbd2: don't use state lock during commit path

Variables journal->j_fc_off, journal->j_fc_wbuf are accessed during
commit path. Since today we allow only one process to perform a fast
commit, there is no need take state lock before accessing these
variables. This patch removes these locks and adds comments to
describe this.
