vfio/fsl-mc: Added lock support in preparation for interrupt handling

Only the DPRC object allocates interrupts from the MSI
interrupt domain. The interrupts are managed by the DPRC in
a pool of interrupts. The access to this pool of interrupts
has to be protected with a lock.
This patch extends the current lock implementation to have a
lock per DPRC.
