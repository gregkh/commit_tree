instrumented.h: Introduce read-write instrumentation hooks

Introduce read-write instrumentation hooks, to more precisely denote an
operation's behaviour.

KCSAN is able to distinguish compound instrumentation, and with the new
instrumentation we then benefit from improved reporting. More
importantly, read-write compound operations should not implicitly be
treated as atomic, if they aren't actually atomic.
