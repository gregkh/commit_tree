ext4: fix bogus warning in ext4_update_dx_flag()

The idea of the warning in ext4_update_dx_flag() is that we should warn
when we are clearing EXT4_INODE_INDEX on a filesystem with metadata
checksums enabled since after clearing the flag, checksums for internal
htree nodes will become invalid. So there's no need to warn (or actually
do anything) when EXT4_INODE_INDEX is not set.
