btrfs: call submit_bio_hook directly in submit_one_bio

BTRFS has 2 inode types (for the purposes of the code in submit_one_bio)
- ordinary data inodes (including the freespace inode) and the btree
inode. Both of these implement submit_bio_hook so btrfsic_submit_bio can
never be called from submit_one_bio so just remove it.
