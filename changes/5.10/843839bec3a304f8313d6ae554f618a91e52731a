habanalabs: expose sync manager resources allocation in INFO IOCTL

Although the driver defines the first user-available sync manager object
and monitor in habanalabs.h, we would like to also expose this information
via the INFO IOCTL so the runtime can get this information dynamically.
This is because in future ASICs we won't need to define it statically.
