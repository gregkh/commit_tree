vt_ioctl: fix GIO_UNIMAP regression

In commit 5ba127878722, we shuffled with the check of 'perm'. But my
brain somehow inverted the condition in 'do_unimap_ioctl' (I thought
it is ||, not &&), so GIO_UNIMAP stopped working completely.

Move the 'perm' checks back to do_unimap_ioctl and do them right again.
In fact, this reverts this part of code to the pre-5ba127878722 state.
Except 'perm' is now a bool.

Fixes: 5ba127878722 ("vt_ioctl: move perm checks level up")
