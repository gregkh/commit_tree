drm/tegra: output: Do not put OF node twice

The original patch for commit 3d2e7aec7013 ("drm/tegra: output: Don't
leak OF node on error") contained this hunk, but it was accidentally
dropped during conflict resolution. This causes use-after-free errors
on devices that use an I2C controller for HDMI DDC/CI on Tegra210 and
later.
