static_call: Add inline static call infrastructure

Add infrastructure for an arch-specific CONFIG_HAVE_STATIC_CALL_INLINE
option, which is a faster version of CONFIG_HAVE_STATIC_CALL.  At
runtime, the static call sites are patched directly, rather than using
the out-of-line trampolines.

Compared to out-of-line static calls, the performance benefits are more
modest, but still measurable.  Steven Rostedt did some tracepoint
measurements:

This code is heavily inspired by the jump label code (aka "static
jumps"), as some of the concepts are very similar.

For more details, see the comments in include/linux/static_call.h.
