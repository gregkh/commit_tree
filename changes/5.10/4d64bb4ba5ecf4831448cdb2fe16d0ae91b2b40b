hwmon: (applesmc) Re-work SMC comms

Commit fff2d0f701e6 ("hwmon: (applesmc) avoid overlong udelay()")
introduced an issue whereby communication with the SMC became
unreliable with write errors like :

[  120.378614] applesmc: send_byte(0x00, 0x0300) fail: 0x40
[  120.378621] applesmc: LKSB: write data fail
[  120.512782] applesmc: send_byte(0x00, 0x0300) fail: 0x40
[  120.512787] applesmc: LKSB: write data fail

The original code appeared to be timing sensitive and was not reliable
with the timing changes in the aforementioned commit.

This patch re-factors the SMC communication to remove the timing
dependencies and restore function with the changes previously
committed.
