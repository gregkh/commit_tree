i2c: rcar: refactor and shorten timeout when resetting

LOOP_TIMEOUT was only used back then because we didn't want to introduce
another constant. The timeout value can easily be a magnitude shorter
because the typical range is 3us - 8us. Refactor the code to use the
poll_timeout helper, use a specific timeout value and get rid of the
ugly LOOP_TIMEOUT constant.
