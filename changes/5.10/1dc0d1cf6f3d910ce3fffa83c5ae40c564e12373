s390/ism: fix incorrect system EID

The system EID that is defined by the ISM driver is not correct. Using
an incorrect system EID allows to communicate with remote Linux systems
that use the same incorrect system EID, but when it comes to
interoperability with other operating systems then the system EIDs do
never match which prevents SMC-Dv2 communication.
Using the correct system EID fixes this problem.
