kernel-doc: add support for ____cacheline_aligned attribute

Subroutine dump_struct uses type attributes to check if the struct
syntax is valid. Then, it removes all attributes before using it for
output. `____cacheline_aligned` is an attribute that is
not included in both steps. Add it, since it is used by kernel structs.

Based on previous patch to add ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp.
Motivated by patches to reorder this attribute to before the
variable name.   Whilst we could do that in all cases, that would
be a massive change and it is more common in the kernel to place
this particular attribute after the variable name. A quick grep
suggests approximately 400 instances of which 341 have this
attribute just before a semicolon and hence after the variable name.
