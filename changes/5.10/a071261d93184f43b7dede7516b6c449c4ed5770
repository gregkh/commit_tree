KVM: arm64: nVHE: Fix pointers during SMCCC convertion

The host need not concern itself with the pointer differences for the
hyp interfaces that are shared between VHE and nVHE so leave it to the
hyp to handle.

As the SMCCC function IDs are converted into function calls, it is a
suitable place to also convert any pointer arguments into hyp pointers.
This, additionally, eases the reuse of the handlers in different
contexts.
