ALSA: hda - handle multiple i915 device instances

Currently i915_component_master_match() will return the first matching
i915 instance. This does not work in case system has multiple i915
and HDA audio controller instances.

Add a new connectivity check that handles following cases:
 - i915 and HDA controller on same PCI bus
 - discrete GPU with embedded HDA audio controller connected
   via PCI bridge
