net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: fix cpts irq after suspend

Depending on the SoC/platform the CPSW can completely lose context after a
suspend/resume cycle, including CPSW wrapper (WR) which will cause reset of
WR_C0_MISC_EN register, so CPTS IRQ will became disabled.

Fix it by moving CPTS IRQ enabling in cpsw_ndo_open() where CPTS is
actually started.
