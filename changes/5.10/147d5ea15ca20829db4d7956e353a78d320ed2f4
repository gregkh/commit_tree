media: i2c: adv748x: Adjust TXA data lanes number

When outputting SD-Core output through the TXA MIPI CSI-2 interface,
the number of enabled data lanes should be reduced in order to guarantee
that the two video formats produced by the SD-Core (480i and 576i)
generate a MIPI CSI-2 link clock frequency compatible with the MIPI D-PHY
specifications.

Limit the number of enabled data lanes to 2, which is guaranteed to
support 480i and 576i formats.

Cache the number of enabled data lanes to be able to report it through
the new get_mbus_config operation.
