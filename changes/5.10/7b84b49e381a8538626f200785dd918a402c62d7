blk-iocost: make iocg_kick_waitq() call iocg_kick_delay() after paying debt

iocg_kick_waitq() is the function which pays debt and iocg_kick_delay()
updates the actual delay status accordingly. If iocg_kick_delay() is not
called after iocg_kick_delay() updated debt, unnecessarily large delays can
be applied temporarily.

Let's make sure such conditions don't occur by making iocg_kick_waitq()
always call iocg_kick_delay() after paying debt.
