fuse: fix page dereference after free

After unlock_request() pages from the ap->pages[] array may be put (e.g. by
aborting the connection) and the pages can be freed.

Prevent use after free by grabbing a reference to the page before calling
unlock_request().

The original patch was created by Pradeep P V K.
