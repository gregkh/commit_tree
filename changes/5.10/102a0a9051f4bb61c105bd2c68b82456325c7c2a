Revert "drm/i915/gem: Async GPU relocations only"

This reverts commit 9e0f9464e2ab ("drm/i915/gem: Async GPU relocations only"),
and related commit 7ac2d2536dfa7 ("drm/i915/gem: Delete unused code").

Async GPU relocations are not the path forward, we want to remove
GPU accelerated relocation support eventually when userspace is fixed
to use VM_BIND, and this is the first step towards that. We will keep
async gpu relocations around for now, until userspace is fixed.

Relocation support will be disabled completely on platforms where there
was never any userspace that depends on it, as the hardware doesn't
require it from at least gen9+ onward. For older platforms, the plan
is to use cpu relocations only.

The igt side is fixed in igt commit 39e9aa1032a4e ("tests/i915: Remove
subtests that rely on async relocation behavior").
