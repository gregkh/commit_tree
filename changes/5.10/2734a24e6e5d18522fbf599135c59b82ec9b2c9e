r8169: fix issue with forced threading in combination with shared interrupts

As reported by Serge flag IRQF_NO_THREAD causes an error if the
interrupt is actually shared and the other driver(s) don't have this
flag set. This situation can occur if a PCI(e) legacy interrupt is
used in combination with forced threading.
There's no good way to deal with this properly, therefore we have to
remove flag IRQF_NO_THREAD. For fixing the original forced threading
issue switch to napi_schedule().
