hwmon: (sparx5) Fix initial reading of temperature

If the temperature is read before the internal calibration is
completed, the driver returns -EIO. Instead it should return -EAGAIN
to encourage repeating the operation.

Note (groeck): Returning -EAGAIN to userspace may result in hard loops;
some userspace code interprets -EAGAIN as request to retry immediately.
I would prefer -ENODATA, but it turns out that the thermal subsystem only
handles -EAGAIN silently, so we'll have to stick with that.
