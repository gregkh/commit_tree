scsi: qla2xxx: remove incorrect sparse #ifdef

The code to try to shut up sparse warnings about questionable locking
didn't shut up sparse: it made the result not parse as valid C at all,
since the end result now has a label with no statement.

The proper fix is to just always lock the hardware, the same way Bart
did in commit 8ae178760b23 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Simplify the functions for
dumping firmware").  That avoids the whole problem with having locking
that is not statically obvious.

But in the meantime, just remove the incorrect attempt at trying to
avoid a sparse warning that just made things worse.

This was exposed by commit 3e6efab865ac ("scsi: qla2xxx: Fix reset of
MPI firmware"), very similarly to how commit cbb01c2f2f63 ("scsi:
qla2xxx: Fix MPI failure AEN (8200) handling") exposed the same problem
in another place, and caused that commit 8ae178760b23.

Please don't add code to just shut up sparse without actually fixing
what sparse complains about.
