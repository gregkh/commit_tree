drm/i915: Filter wake_flags passed to default_wake_function

(NOTE: This is the minimal backportable fix, a full fix is being
developed at https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/388048/)

The flags passed to the wait_entry.func are passed onwards to
try_to_wake_up(), which has a very particular interpretation for its
wake_flags. In particular, beyond the published WF_SYNC, it has a few
internal flags as well. Since we passed the fence->error down the chain
via the flags argument, these ended up in the default_wake_function
confusing the kernel/sched.
