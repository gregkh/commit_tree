drm/vc4: crtc: Keep the previously assigned HVS FIFO

The HVS FIFOs are currently assigned each time we have an atomic_check
for all the enabled CRTCs.

However, if we are running multiple outputs in parallel and we happen to
disable the first (by index) CRTC, we end up changing the assigned FIFO
of the second CRTC without disabling and reenabling the pixelvalve which
ends up in a stall and eventually a VBLANK timeout.

In order to fix this, we can create a special value for our assigned
channel to mark it as disabled, and if our CRTC already had an assigned
channel in its previous state, we keep on using it.
