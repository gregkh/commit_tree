ASoC: qcom: lpass-cpu: Fix clock disable failure

Disable MI2S bit clock from PAUSE/STOP/SUSPEND usecase instead of
shutdown time. Acheive this by invoking clk_disable API from
cpu daiops trigger instead of cpu daiops shutdown.
Change non-atomic API "clk_prepare_enable" to atomic API
"clk_enable" in trigger, as trigger is being called from atomic context.
