arm64: dts: ti: Add support for J7200 SoC

The J7200 SoC is a part of the K3 Multicore SoC architecture platform.
It is targeted for automotive gateway, vehicle compute systems,
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications.
The SoC aims to meet the complex processing needs of modern embedded
products.

Some highlights of this SoC are:
* Dual Cortex-A72s in a single cluster, two clusters of lockstep
  capable dual Cortex-R5F MCUs and a Centralized Device Management and
  Security Controller (DMSC).
* Configurable L3 Cache and IO-coherent architecture with high data
  throughput capable distributed DMA architecture under NAVSS.
* Integrated Ethernet switch supporting up to a total of 4 external ports
  in addition to legacy Ethernet switch of up to 2 ports.
* Upto 1 PCIe-GEN3 controller, 1 USB3.0 Dual-role device subsystems,
  20 MCANs, 3 McASP, eMMC and SD, OSPI/HyperBus memory controller, I3C
  and I2C, eCAP/eQEP, eHRPWM among other peripherals.
* One hardware accelerator block containing AES/DES/SHA/MD5 called SA2UL
  management.
