spi: dw: Refactor data IO procedure

The Tx and Rx data write/read procedure can be significantly simplified by
using Tx/Rx transfer lengths instead of the end pointers. By having the
Tx/Rx data leftover lengths (in the number of transfer words) we can get
rid of all subtraction and division operations utilized here and there in
the tx_max(), rx_max(), dw_writer() and dw_reader() methods. Such
modification will not only give us the more optimized IO procedures, but
will make the data IO methods much more readable than before.
