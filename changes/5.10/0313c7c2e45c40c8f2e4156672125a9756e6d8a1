mlx4: make sure to always set the port type

Even tho mlx4_core registers the devlink ports, it's mlx4_en
and mlx4_ib which set their type. In situations where one of
the two is not built yet the machine has ports of given type
we see the devlink warning from devlink_port_type_warn() trigger.

Having ports of a type not supported by the kernel may seem
surprising, but it does occur in practice - when the unsupported
port is not plugged in to a switch anyway users are more than happy
not to see it (and potentially allocate any resources to it).

Set the type in mlx4_core if type-specific driver is not built.
