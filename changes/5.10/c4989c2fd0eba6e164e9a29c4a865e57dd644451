btrfs: simplify setting/clearing fs_info to btrfs_fs_devices

It makes no sense to have sysfs-related routines be responsible for
properly initialising the fs_info pointer of struct btrfs_fs_device.
Instead this can be streamlined by making it the responsibility of
btrfs_init_devices_late to initialize it. That function already
initializes fs_info of every individual device in btrfs_fs_devices.

As far as clearing it is concerned it makes sense to move it to
close_fs_devices. That function is only called when struct
btrfs_fs_devices is no longer in use - either for holding seeds or
main devices for a mounted filesystem.
