carl9170: Convert 'ar9170_qmap' to inline function

'ar9170_qmap' is used in some source files which include carl9170.h,
but not all of them.  A 'defined but not used' warning is thrown when
compiling the ones which do not use it.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s)

 from drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/carl9170.h:57,
 In file included from drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/carl9170.h:57,
 drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/carl9170.h:71:17: warning: ‘ar9170_qmap’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]

 NB: Snipped - lots of these repeat
