net: hns3: add support for 200G device

The 200G device has a new device id 0xA228, so adds this device id to
pci table, then the driver can probe it.

As speed_ability queried from firmware has only 8 bits and already be
used up, so firmware adds extra speed_ability_ext to indicate more
speed abilities to support 200G and driver needs to parse it.
