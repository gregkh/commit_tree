usb: atm: don't use snprintf() for sysfs attrs

kernel/cpu.c: don't use snprintf() for sysfs attrs

As per the documentation (Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.rst),
snprintf() should not be used for formatting values returned by sysfs.

In all of these cases, sprintf() suffices as we know that the formatted
strings will be less than PAGE_SIZE in length.
