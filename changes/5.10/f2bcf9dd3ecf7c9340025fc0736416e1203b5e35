s390/qeth: consolidate teardown code

Clarify which discipline-specific steps are needed to roll back after
error in qeth_l?_set_online(), and which are common to roll back
from qeth_hardsetup_card().

Some steps (cancelling the RX modeset, draining the TX queues) are only
necessary if the netdev was potentially UP before, so move them to the
common qeth_set_offline().
