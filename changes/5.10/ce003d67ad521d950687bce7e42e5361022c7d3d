printk: ringbuffer: fix setting state in desc_read()

It is expected that desc_read() will always set at least the
@state_var field. However, if the descriptor is in an inconsistent
state, no fields are set.

Also, the second load of @state_var is not stored in @desc_out and
so might not match the state value that is returned.

Always set the last loaded @state_var into @desc_out, regardless of
the descriptor consistency.
