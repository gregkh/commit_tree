mmc: mediatek: Drop pointer to mmc_host from msdc_host

The MediaTek MMC driver uses  pointer to get from private
msdc_host structure to the generic mmc_host structure.
However mmc_host always precedes msdc_host in memory so compute
its address with a subtraction (which is cheaper than a dereference)
using mmc_from_priv() and drop the extra pointer.
