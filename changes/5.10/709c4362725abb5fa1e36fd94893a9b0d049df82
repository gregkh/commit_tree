cacheinfo: Move resctrl's get_cache_id() to the cacheinfo header file

resctrl/core.c defines get_cache_id() for use in its cpu-hotplug
callbacks. This gets the id attribute of the cache at the corresponding
level of a CPU.

Later rework means this private function needs to be shared. Move
it to the header file.

The name conflicts with a different definition in intel_cacheinfo.c,
name it get_cpu_cacheinfo_id() to show its relation with
get_cpu_cacheinfo().

Now this is visible on other architectures, check the id attribute
has actually been set.
