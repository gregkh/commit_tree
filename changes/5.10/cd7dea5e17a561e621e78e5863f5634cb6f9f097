ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Fix use of uninitialised pointer

Commit 9c34d023dc35 ("ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Re-arrange files for core McBSP
and Sidetone function split"), in rearranging various files, also replaced
calls to platform_get_resource_by_name() + devm_ioremap_resource() with a
single call to devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname(). However, the
struct resource is needed as we access its members so at present a null
pointer is dereferenced. Fix by doing things the old way.
