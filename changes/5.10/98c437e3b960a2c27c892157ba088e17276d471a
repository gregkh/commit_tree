media: staging: rkisp1: params: avoid using buffer if params is not streaming

Currently, the first buffer queued in the params node is returned
immediately to userspace and a copy of it is saved in the field
'cur_params'. The copy is later used for the first configuration
when the stream is initiated by one of selfpath/mainpath capture nodes.

There are 3 problems with this implementation:
- The first params buffer is applied and returned to userspace even if
userspace never calls to streamon on the params node.
- If the first params buffer is queued after the stream started on the
params node then it will return to userspace but will never be used.
- The frame_sequence of the first buffer is set to -1 if the main/selfpath
did not start streaming.

A correct implementation is to apply the first params buffer when stream
is started from mainpath/selfpath and only if params is also streaming.

The patch adds a new function 'rkisp1_params_apply_params_cfg' which takes
a buffer from the buffers queue, apply it and returns it to userspace.
The function is called from the irq handler and when main/selfpath stream
starts - in the function 'rkisp1_params_config_parameter'

Also remove the fields 'cur_params', 'is_first_params' which are no
more needed.
