nl80211: support setting S1G channels

S1G channels have a single width defined per frequency, so
derive it from the channel flags with
ieee80211_s1g_channel_width().

Also support setting an S1G channel where control frequency may
differ from operating, and add some basic validation to
ensure the control channel is with the operating.
