PM: AVS: smartreflex Move driver to soc specific drivers

The avs drivers are all SoC specific drivers that doesn't share any code.
Instead they are located in a directory, mostly to keep similar
functionality together. From a maintenance point of view, it makes better
sense to collect SoC specific drivers like these, into the SoC specific
directories.

Therefore, let's move the smartreflex driver for OMAP to the ti directory.
