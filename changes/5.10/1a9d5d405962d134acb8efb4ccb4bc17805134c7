dax: Modify bdev_dax_pgoff() to handle NULL bdev

virtiofs does not have a block device but it has dax device.
Modify bdev_dax_pgoff() to be able to handle that.

If there is no bdev, that means dax offset is 0. (It can't be a partition
block device starting at an offset in dax device).

This is little hackish. There have been discussions about getting rid
of dax not supporting partitions.

IMHO, this path can easily break exisitng users. For example
ioctl(BLKPG_ADD_PARTITION) will start breaking on block devices
supporting DAX. Also, I personally find it very useful to be able to
partition dax devices and still be able to use DAX.

Alternatively, I tried to store offset into dax device information in iomap
interface, but that got NACKed.

I can't think of a good path to solve this issue properly. So to make
progress, it seems this patch is least bad option for now and I hope
we can take it.
