iwlwifi: pcie: invert values of NO_160 device config entries

The NO_160 flag specifies if the device doesn't have 160 MHz support,
but we errorneously assumed the opposite.  If the flag was set, we
were considering that 160 MHz was supported, but it's actually the
opposite.  Fix it by inverting the bits, i.e. NO_160 is 0x1 and 160
is 0x0.
