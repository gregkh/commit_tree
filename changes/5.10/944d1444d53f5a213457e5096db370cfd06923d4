io_uring: handle -EOPNOTSUPP on path resolution

Any attempt to do path resolution on /proc/self from an async worker will
yield -EOPNOTSUPP. We can safely do that resolution from the task itself,
and without blocking, so retry it from there.

Ideally io_uring would know this upfront and not have to go through the
worker thread to find out, but that doesn't currently seem feasible.
