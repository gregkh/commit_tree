x86/debug: Fix DR_STEP vs ptrace_get_debugreg(6)

Commit d53d9bc0cf78 ("x86/debug: Change thread.debugreg6 to
thread.virtual_dr6") changed the semantics of the variable from random
collection of bits, to exactly only those bits that ptrace() needs.

Unfortunately this lost DR_STEP for PTRACE_{BLOCK,SINGLE}STEP.

Furthermore, it turns out that userspace expects DR_STEP to be
unconditionally available, even for manual TF usage outside of
PTRACE_{BLOCK,SINGLE}_STEP.
