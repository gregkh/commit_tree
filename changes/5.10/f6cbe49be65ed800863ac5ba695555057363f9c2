drm/i915/display/dp: Compute the correct slice count for VDSC on DP

This patch fixes the slice count computation algorithm
for calculating the slice count based on Peak pixel rate
and the max slice width allowed on the DSC engines.
We need to ensure slice count > min slice count req
as per DP spec based on peak pixel rate and that it is
greater than min slice count based on the max slice width
advertised by DPCD. So use max of these two.
In the prev patch we were using min of these 2 causing it
to violate the max slice width limitation causing a blank
screen on 8K@60.
