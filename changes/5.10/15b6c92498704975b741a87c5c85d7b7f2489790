drm/i915: Move i915_vma_lock in the selftests to avoid lock inversion, v3.

Make sure vma_lock is not used as inner lock when kernel context is used,
and add ww handling where appropriate.

Ensure that execbuf selftests keep passing by using ww handling.

Changes since v2:
- Fix i915_gem_context finally.
