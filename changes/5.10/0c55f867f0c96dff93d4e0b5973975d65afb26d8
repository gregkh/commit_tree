selftests: kvm/set_memory_region_test: Fix race in move region test

The current memory region move test correctly handles the situation that
the second (realigning) memslot move operation would temporarily trigger
MMIO until it completes, however it does not handle the case in which the
first (misaligning) move operation does this, too.
This results in false test assertions in case it does so.

Fix this by handling temporary MMIO from the first memslot move operation
in the test guest code, too.
