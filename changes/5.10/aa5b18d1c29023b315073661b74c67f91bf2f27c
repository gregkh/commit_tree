ASoC: da7219: Move soft reset handling to codec level probe

As part of the reorganisation of the device level and codec
level probe functionlity, the soft reset handling should really
reside at the codec level and after the instantiation of supplies.
This commit makes the relevant changes to support this change of
scope including the remove of devm_* functions being called for
regulator instantiation at the codec level.
