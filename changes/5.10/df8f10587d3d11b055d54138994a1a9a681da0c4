PCI/ASPM: Remove struct pcie_link_state.l1ss

Previously we computed L1.2 parameters in the enumeration path, saved them
in struct pcie_link_state.l1ss, and programmed them into the devices
whenever we enabled or disabled L1.2 on the link.  But these parameters are
constant and don't need to be updated when enabling/disabling L1.2.

Compute and program the L1.2 parameters once during enumeration and remove
the struct pcie_link_state.l1ss member.  No functional change intended.
