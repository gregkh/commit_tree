ASoC: ak4458: Add DSD support for ak4458 and ak4497

Ak4458 can't support DSD512 format, but ak4497 can, so add
a new enum variable (enum ak4458_type) in ak4458_drvdata to
distinguish these two platforms.

Ak4497 has two kinds of DSD input pin, it can be selected by
the dsd-path property from DT.

In hw_params(), bit clock is calculated according to different
DSD format (DSD64, DSD128, DSD256, DSD512), then registers
are configured.
