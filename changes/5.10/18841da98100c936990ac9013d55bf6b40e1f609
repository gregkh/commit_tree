tools: bpftool: Automate generation for "SEE ALSO" sections in man pages

The "SEE ALSO" sections of bpftool's manual pages refer to bpf(2),
bpf-helpers(7), then all existing bpftool man pages (save the current
one).

This leads to nearly-identical lists being duplicated in all manual
pages. Ideally, when a new page is created, all lists should be updated
accordingly, but this has led to omissions and inconsistencies multiple
times in the past.

Let's take it out of the RST files and generate the "SEE ALSO" sections
automatically in the Makefile when generating the man pages. The lists
are not really useful in the RST anyway because all other pages are
available in the same directory.

v3:
- Fix conflict with a previous patchset that introduced RST2MAN_OPTS
  variable passed to rst2man.

v2:
- Use "echo -n" instead of "printf" in Makefile, to avoid any risk of
  passing a format string directly to the command.
