ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: modify core_power_up/down op

Modify the core_power_up/down ops for HDA platforms to restrict
the core_mask to the ones allowed by chip->cores_mask. This is needed
because on some HDA platforms not all cores can be powered up/down
by the host and this must be handled internally in the FW.
