habanalabs: replace armcp with the generic cpucp

ArmCP mandates that the device CPU is always an ARM processor, which might
be wrong in the future.

Most of this change is an internal renaming of variables, functions and
defines but there are two entries in sysfs which have armcp in their
names. Add identical cpucp entries but don't remove yet the armcp entries.
Those will be deprecated next year. Add the documentation about it in sysfs
documentation.
