ASoC: rt5682: Use clk_hw based APIs for registration

The (new?) style of clk registration uses clk_hw based APIs so that we
can more easily see the difference between clk providers and clk
consumers. Use the clk_hw based APIs to do this and migrate to devm for
the clkdev creation so that we can reduce the amount of code.
