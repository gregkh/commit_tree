ASoC: fsl_sai: Set SAI Channel Mode to Output Mode

Transmit data pins will output zero when slots are masked or channels
are disabled. In CHMOD TDM mode, transmit data pins are tri-stated when
slots are masked or channels are disabled. When data pins are tri-stated,
there is noise on some channels when FS clock value is high and data is
read while fsclk is transitioning from high to low.
