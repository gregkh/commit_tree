libbpf: Add btf__str_by_offset() as a more generic variant of name_by_offset

BTF strings are used not just for names, they can be arbitrary strings used
for CO-RE relocations, line/func infos, etc. Thus "name_by_offset" terminology
is too specific and might be misleading. Instead, introduce
btf__str_by_offset() API which uses generic string terminology.
