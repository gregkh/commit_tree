rcu: Add READ_ONCE() to rcu_do_batch() access to rcu_divisor

Given that sysfs can change the value of rcu_divisor at any time, this
commit adds a READ_ONCE to the sole access to that variable.  While in
the area, this commit also adds bounds checking, clamping the value to
a shift that makes sense for a signed long.
