checkpatch: warn if trace_printk and friends are called

trace_printk is meant as a debugging tool, and should not be compiled into
production code without specific debug Kconfig options enabled, or source
code changes, as indicated by the warning that shows up on boot if any
trace_printk is called:

 **   NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE   **
 **                                                      **
 ** trace_printk() being used. Allocating extra memory.  **
 **                                                      **
 ** This means that this is a DEBUG kernel and it is     **
 ** unsafe for production use.                           **

Let's warn developers when they try to submit such a change.
