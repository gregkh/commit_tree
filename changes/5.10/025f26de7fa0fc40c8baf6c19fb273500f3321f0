platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Fix the slp_s0 counter displayed value

slp_s0 counter value displayed via debugfs interface is calculated by
multiplying the granularity for crystal oscillator tick as 100us with
the value read from using slp_s0 offset. But the granularity of the tick
varies from platform to platform and it needs to be fixed.

Hence, specify granularity of the tick for each platform, so that the
value of the slp_s0 counter is accurate.
