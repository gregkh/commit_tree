iomap: Allow filesystem to call iomap_dio_complete without i_rwsem

This is to avoid the deadlock caused in btrfs because of O_DIRECT |
O_DSYNC.

Filesystems such as btrfs require i_rwsem while performing sync on a
file. iomap_dio_rw() is called under i_rw_sem. This leads to a
deadlock because of:

iomap_dio_complete()
  generic_write_sync()
    btrfs_sync_file()

Separate out iomap_dio_complete() from iomap_dio_rw(), so filesystems
can call iomap_dio_complete() after unlocking i_rwsem.
