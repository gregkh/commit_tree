x86/uaccess: Use XORL %0,%0 in __get_user_asm()

XORL %0,%0 is equivalent to XORQ %0,%0 as both will zero the entire
register. Use XORL %0,%0 for all operand sizes to avoid REX prefix byte
when legacy registers are used and to avoid size prefix byte when 16bit
registers are used.

Zeroing the full register is OK in this use case.

As a result, the size of the .fixup section decreases by 20 bytes.
