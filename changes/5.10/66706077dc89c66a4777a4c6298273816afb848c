usb: dwc3: ep0: Fix ZLP for OUT ep0 requests

The current ZLP handling for ep0 requests is only for control IN
requests. For OUT direction, DWC3 needs to check and setup for MPS
alignment.

Usually, control OUT requests can indicate its transfer size via the
wLength field of the control message. So usb_request->zero is usually
not needed for OUT direction. To handle ZLP OUT for control endpoint,
make sure the TRB is MPS size.
