clk: renesas: r8a7742: Add clk entry for VSPR

Add clock entry 130 for VSPR (VSP for Resizing) module, so that this module
can be used on R8A7742 (RZ/G1H) SoC.

Alongside rename clock entry "vsp1-sy" to "vsps" (VSP Standard), so that
VSP1 clock names are in sync.

Note: The entry for VSPR clock was accidentally dropped from RZ/G manual
when all the information related to RT were removed.
