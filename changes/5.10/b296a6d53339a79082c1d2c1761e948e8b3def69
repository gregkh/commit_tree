kernel.h: split out min()/max() et al. helpers

kernel.h is being used as a dump for all kinds of stuff for a long time.
Here is the attempt to start cleaning it up by splitting out min()/max()
et al.  helpers.

At the same time convert users in header and lib folder to use new header.
Though for time being include new header back to kernel.h to avoid
twisted indirected includes for other existing users.
