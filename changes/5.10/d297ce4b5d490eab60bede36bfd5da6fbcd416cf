drm/nouveau/kms: Only use hpd_work for reprobing in HPD paths

Currently we perform both short IRQ handling for DP, and connector
reprobing in the HPD IRQ handler. However since we need to grab
connection_mutex in order to reprobe a connector, in theory we could
accidentally block ourselves from handling any short IRQs until after a
modeset completes if a connector hotplug happens to occur in parallel
with a modeset.

I haven't seen this actually happen yet, but since we're cleaning up
nouveau's hotplug handling code anyway and we already have a hpd worker,
we can simply fix this by only relying on the HPD worker to actually
reprobe connectors when we receive a HPD IRQ. We also add a mask to
nouveau_drm to keep track of which connectors are waiting to be reprobed
in response to an HPD IRQ.
