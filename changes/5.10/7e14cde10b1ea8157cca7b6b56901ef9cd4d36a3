xen/events: make struct irq_info private to events_base.c

The struct irq_info of Xen's event handling is used only for two
evtchn_ops functions outside of events_base.c. Those two functions
can easily be switched to avoid that usage.

This allows to make struct irq_info and its related access functions
private to events_base.c.
