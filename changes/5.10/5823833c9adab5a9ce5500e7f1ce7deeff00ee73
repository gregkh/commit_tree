media: v4l2-ctrl: Add VP9 codec levels

Add menu control for VP9 codec levels. A total of 14 levels are
defined for Profile 0 (8bit) and Profile 2 (10bit). Each level
is a set of constrained bitstreams coded with targeted resolutions,
frame rates, and bitrates.

The definitions have been taken from webm project [1].
