ARM: at91: pm: add support for ULP0 fast wakeup

ULP0 fast improves suspend/resume time with few milliseconds the drawback
being the power consumption. The mean values measured for suspend/resume
time are as follows (measured on SAMA5D2 Xplained board), ULP0 compared
with fast ULP0:
- ulp0 fast: suspend time: 169 ms, resume time: 216 ms
- ulp0     : suspend time: 197 ms, resume time: 258 ms

Current consumption while suspended (measured on SAMA5D2 Xplained board):
- ulp0 fast: 730uA
- ulp0     : 270uA
