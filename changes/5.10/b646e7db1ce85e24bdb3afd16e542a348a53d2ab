platform/chrome: cros_ec_sysfs: Report range of error codes from EC

Since commit c5cd2b47b203 ("platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: Report command
not supported") we can no longer assume that cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status()
reports -EPROTO for all errors returned by the EC itself. A follow-up
patch will change cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status() to report additional errors
reported by the EC as distinguished Linux error codes.

Prepare for this change by always reporting both the Linux error code
and the EC error code in sysfs attributes.
