powerpc/tools: Remove 90 line limit in checkpatch script

As of commit bdc48fa11e46, scripts/checkpatch.pl now has a default line
length warning of 100 characters.  The powerpc wrapper script was using
a length of 90 instead of 80 in order to make checkpatch less
restrictive, but now it's making it more restrictive instead.

I think it makes sense to just use the default value now.
