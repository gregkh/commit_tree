regulator: qcom_spmi: Add support for new regulator types

This commit adds the support for some regulator types that are
missing in this driver, such as the ht nmos-ldo, ht-lv nmos-ldo
and new gen n/pmos-ldo, all belonging to the FTSMPS426 register
layout.
This is done in preparation for adding support for the PM660 and
PM660L PMICs.
