ASoC: sun8i-codec: Hook up component probe function

Due to a mistake made while reordering patches, commit 90cac932976e
("ASoC: sun8i-codec: Fix DAPM to match the hardware topology") added
the sun8i_codec_component_probe function without referencing it from
the component definition. Add the reference so the probe function gets
called as expected.
