scsi: qla2xxx: Fix I/O failures during remote port toggle testing

Driver was using a lower value for dev_loss_tmo making it more prone to I/O
failures during remote port toggle testing. Set dev_loss_tmo to zero during
remote port registration to allow nvme-fc default dev_loss_tmo to be used,
which is higher than what driver was using.
