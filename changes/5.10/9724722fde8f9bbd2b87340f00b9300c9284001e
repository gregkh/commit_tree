firmware: arm_scmi: Add missing Rx size re-initialisation

Few commands provide the list of description partially and require
to be called consecutively until all the descriptors are fetched
completely. In such cases, we don't release the buffers and reuse
them for consecutive transmits.

However, currently we don't reset the Rx size which will be set as
per the response for the last transmit. This may result in incorrect
response size being interpretted as the firmware may repond with size
greater than the one set but we read only upto the size set by previous
response.

Let us reset the receive buffer size to max possible in such cases as
we don't know the exact size of the response.
