sched: Replace zero-length array with flexible-array

In the following commit:

  04f5c362ec6d: ("sched/fair: Replace zero-length array with flexible-array")

a zero-length array cpumask[0] has been replaced with cpumask[].
But there is still a cpumask[0] in 'struct sched_group_capacity'
which was missed.

The point of using [] instead of [0] is that with [] the compiler will
generate a build warning if it isn't the last member of a struct.
