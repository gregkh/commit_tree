xfs: avoid shared rmap operations for attr fork extents

During code review, I noticed that the rmap code uses the (slower)
shared mappings rmap functions for any extent of a reflinked file, even
if those extents are for the attr fork, which doesn't support sharing.
We can speed up rmap a tiny bit by optimizing out this case.
