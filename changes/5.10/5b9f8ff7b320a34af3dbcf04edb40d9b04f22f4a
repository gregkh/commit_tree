sched/debug: Output SD flag names rather than their values

Decoding the output of /proc/sys/kernel/sched_domain/cpu*/domain*/flags has
always been somewhat annoying, as one needs to go fetch the bit -> name
mapping from the source code itself. This encoding can be saved in a script
somewhere, but that isn't safe from flags being added, removed or even
shuffled around.

What matters for debugging purposes is to get *which* flags are set in a
given domain, their associated value is pretty much meaningless.

Make the sd flags debug file output flag names.
