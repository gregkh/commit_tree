PCI: vmd: Update VMD PM to correctly use generic PCI PM

The pci_save_state() call in vmd_suspend() can be performed by
pci_pm_suspend_irq(). This also allows VMD to benefit from the call into
pci_prepare_to_sleep().

The pci_restore_state() call in vmd_resume() was restoring state after
pci_pm_resume()::pci_restore_standard_config() had already restored state.
It's also been suspected that the config state should have been restored
before re-requesting IRQs instead of afterwards.

Remove the pci_save_state()/pci_restore_state() calls in
vmd_suspend()/vmd_resume() to allow proper flow through generic PCI core
Power Management code.
