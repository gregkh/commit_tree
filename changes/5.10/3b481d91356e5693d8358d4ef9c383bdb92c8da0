block: add zone specific block statuses

A zoned device with limited resources to open or activate zones may
return an error when the host exceeds those limits. The same command may
be successful if retried later, but the host needs to wait for specific
zone states before it should expect a retry to succeed. Have the block
layer provide an appropriate status for these conditions so applications
can distinuguish this error for special handling.
