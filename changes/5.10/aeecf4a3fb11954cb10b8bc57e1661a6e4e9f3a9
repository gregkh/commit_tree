selinux: Create function for selinuxfs directory cleanup

Separating the cleanup from the creation will simplify two things in
future patches in this series.  First, the creation can be made generic,
to create directories not tied to the selinux_fs_info structure.  Second,
we will ultimately want to reorder creation and deletion so that the
deletions aren't performed until the new directory structures have already
been moved into place.
