arm64: dts: allwinner: A64 Sopine: phy-mode rgmii-id

Since commit bbc4d71d6354 ("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e rx/tx
delay config") iSCSI booting fails on the Pine A64 LTS.

This patch changes the phy-mode to use internal delays both for RX and TX
as has been done for other boards affected by the same commit.
