powerpc/smp: Stop updating cpu_core_mask

Anton Blanchard reported that his 4096 vcpu KVM guest took around 30
minutes to boot. He also analyzed it to the time taken to iterate while
setting the cpu_core_mask.

Further analysis shows that cpu_core_mask and cpu_cpu_mask for any CPU
would be equal on Power. However updating cpu_core_mask took forever to
update as its a per cpu cpumask variable. Instead cpu_cpu_mask was a per
NODE /per DIE cpumask that was shared by all the respective CPUs.

Also cpu_cpu_mask is needed from a scheduler perspective. However
cpu_core_map is an exported symbol. Hence stop updating cpu_core_map
and make it point to cpu_cpu_mask.
