lan743x: fix "BUG: invalid wait context" when setting rx mode

In the net core, the struct net_device_ops -> ndo_set_rx_mode()
callback is called with the dev->addr_list_lock spinlock held.

However, this driver's ndo_set_rx_mode callback eventually calls
lan743x_dp_write(), which acquires a mutex. Mutex acquisition
may sleep, and this is not allowed when holding a spinlock.

Fix by removing the dp_lock mutex entirely. Its purpose is to
prevent concurrent accesses to the data port. No concurrent
accesses are possible, because the dev->addr_list_lock
spinlock in the core only lets through one thread at a time.
