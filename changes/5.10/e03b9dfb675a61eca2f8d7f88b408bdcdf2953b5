MAINTAINERS: make linux-usb list remarks consistent

Commit f24f27b85ead ("MAINTAINERS: add entry for mediatek usb3 DRD IP
driver") claims linux-usb@vger.kernel.org is moderated for
non-subscribers, but all other 46 entries for linux-usb@vger.kernel.org
do not mention that.

Adjust this entry to be consistent with all others.
