serial: fsl_lpuart: add sysrq support when using dma

Add handling of magic sysrq keys when using dma/edma.

Tested by sending BREAK followed by a sysrq command inside
a 5 secs time window, by:

echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq

BREAK + h, t, e, b, c

Tested also sending a command after 5 secs after BREAK, that's
properly ignored.
