selftests: net: tcp_mmap: use madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)

When TCP_ZEROCOPY_RECEIVE operation has been added,
I made the mistake of automatically un-mapping prior
content before mapping new pages.

This has the unfortunate effect of adding potentially long
MMU operations (like TLB flushes) while socket lock is held.

Using madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) right after pages has been used
has two benefits :

1) This releases pages sooner, allowing pages to be recycled
if they were part of a page pool in a NIC driver.

2) No more long unmap operations while preventing immediate
processing of incoming packets.

The cost of the added system call is small enough.

Arjun will submit a kernel patch allowing to opt out from
the unmap attempt in tcp_zerocopy_receive()
