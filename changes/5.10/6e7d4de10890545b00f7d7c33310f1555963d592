mmc: renesas_sdhi: move wrong 'hw_reset' to 'reset'

This driver got the usage of 'hw_reset' wrong and missed that it is used
to reset the remote HW (card) only, not the local one (controller). Move
everything to the proper 'reset' callback. Also, add the generic reset
code from TMIO, so we will ensure the same behaviour (it will get
refactored away in a later patch). This also means we need to drop
MMC_CAP_HW_RESET because this is currently not supported by our
hardware.
