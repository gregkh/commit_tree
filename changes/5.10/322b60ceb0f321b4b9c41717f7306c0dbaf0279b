ath11k: do not depend on ARCH_QCOM for ath11k

With only IPQ8074 supported ath11k was only usable on Qualcomm architectures.
But now that we are adding QCA6390 PCI support to ath11k that's not the case
anymore and it can be used on any architecture supporting PCI. So remove the
dependency on ARCH_QCOM. After that there is also no need to depend on
COMPILE_TEST.

Tested-on: QCA6390 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HST.1.0.1-01740-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1
Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.1.0.1-01238-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-2
