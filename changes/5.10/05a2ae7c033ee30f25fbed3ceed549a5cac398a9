x86/insn: Make inat-tables.c suitable for pre-decompression code

The inat-tables.c file has some arrays in it that contain pointers to
other arrays. These pointers need to be relocated when the kernel
image is moved to a different location.

The pre-decompression boot-code has no support for applying ELF
relocations, so initialize these arrays at runtime in the
pre-decompression code to make sure all pointers are correctly
initialized.
