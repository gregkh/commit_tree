x86/sev-es: Adjust #VC IST Stack on entering NMI handler

When an NMI hits in the #VC handler entry code before it has switched to
another stack, any subsequent #VC exception in the NMI code-path will
overwrite the interrupted #VC handler's stack.

Make sure this doesn't happen by explicitly adjusting the #VC IST entry
in the NMI handler for the time it can cause #VC exceptions.
