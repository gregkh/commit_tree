fsi: aspeed: Add module param for bus divisor

For testing and hardware debugging a user may wish to override the
divisor at runtime. By setting fsi_master_aspeed.bus_div=N, the divisor
will be set to N, if 0 < N <= 0x3ff.

This is a module parameter and not a device tree option as it will only
need to be set when testing or debugging.
