io_uring: Fix XArray usage in io_uring_add_task_file

The xas_store() wasn't paired with an xas_nomem() loop, so if it couldn't
allocate memory using GFP_NOWAIT, it would leak the reference to the file
descriptor.  Also the node pointed to by the xas could be freed between
the call to xas_load() under the rcu_read_lock() and the acquisition of
the xa_lock.

It's easier to just use the normal xa_load/xa_store interface here.
