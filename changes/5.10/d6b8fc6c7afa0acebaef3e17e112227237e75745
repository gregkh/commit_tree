xfs: do the assert for all the log done items in xfs_trans_cancel

We should do the assert for all the log intent-done items if they appear
here. This patch detect intent-done items by the fact that their item ops
don't have iop_unpin and iop_push methods and also move the helper
xlog_item_is_intent to xfs_trans.h.
