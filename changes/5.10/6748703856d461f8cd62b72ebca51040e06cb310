hwmon: use simple i2c probe function

Many hwmon drivers don't use the id information provided by the old
i2c probe function, and the remainder can easily be adapted to the new
form ("probe_new") by calling i2c_match_id explicitly.

This avoids scanning the identifier tables during probes.

Drivers which didn't use the id are converted as-is; drivers which did
are modified as follows:

* if the information in i2c_client is sufficient, that's used instead
  (client->name);
* anything else is handled by calling i2c_match_id() with the same
  level of error-handling (if any) as before.

A few drivers aren't included in this patch because they have a
different set of maintainers. They will be covered by other patches.
