btrfs: sysfs: fix unused-but-set-variable warnings

The compilation with W=1 generates the following warnings:
 fs/btrfs/sysfs.c:1630:6: warning: variable 'ret' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  1630 |  int ret;
       |      ^~~
 fs/btrfs/sysfs.c:1629:6: warning: variable 'features' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  1629 |  u64 features;
       |      ^~~~~~~~

[ The unused variables are leftover from e410e34fad91 ("Revert "btrfs:
  synchronize incompat feature bits with sysfs files""), which needs
  to be properly fixed by moving feature bit manipulation from the sysfs
  context.  Silence the warning to save pepople time, we got several
  reports. ]
