mac80211: fix kernel-doc markups

Some identifiers have different names between their prototypes
and the kernel-doc markup.

Others need to be fixed, as kernel-doc markups should use this format:
        identifier - description

In the specific case of __sta_info_flush(), add a documentation
for sta_info_flush(), as this one is the one used outside
sta_info.c.
