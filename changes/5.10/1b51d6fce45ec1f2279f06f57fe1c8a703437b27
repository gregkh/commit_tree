btrfs: send: remove indirect callback parameter for changed_cb

There's a custom callback passed to btrfs_compare_trees which happens to
be named exactly same as the existing function implementing it. This is
confusing and the indirection is not necessary for our needs. Compiler
is clever enough to call it directly so there's effectively no change.
