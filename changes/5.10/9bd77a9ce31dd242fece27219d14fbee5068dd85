spi: fsl-dspi: fix wrong pointer in suspend/resume

Since commit 530b5affc675 ("spi: fsl-dspi: fix use-after-free in
remove path"), this driver causes a "NULL pointer dereference"
in dspi_suspend/resume.
This is because since this commit, the drivers private data point to
"dspi" instead of "ctlr", the codes in suspend and resume func were
not modified correspondly.
