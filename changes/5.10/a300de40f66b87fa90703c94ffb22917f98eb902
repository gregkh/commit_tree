drm/amdgpu: introduce a new parameter to configure how many KCQ we want(v5)

what:
the MQD's save and restore of KCQ (kernel compute queue)
cost lots of clocks during world switch which impacts a lot
to multi-VF performance

how:
introduce a paramter to control the number of KCQ to avoid
performance drop if there is no kernel compute queue needed

notes:
this paramter only affects gfx 8/9/10

v2:
refine namings

v3:
choose queues for each ring to that try best to cross pipes evenly.

v4:
fix indentation
some cleanupsin the gfx_compute_queue_acquire()

v5:
further fix on indentations
more cleanupsin gfx_compute_queue_acquire()

TODO:
in the future we will let hypervisor driver to set this paramter
automatically thus no need for user to configure it through
modprobe in virtual machine
