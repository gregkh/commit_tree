selftests/bpf: Test for map update access from within EXT programs

This adds further tests to ensure access permissions and restrictions
are applied properly for some map types such as sock-map.
It also adds another negative tests to assert static functions cannot be
replaced. In the 'unreliable' mode it still fails with error 'tracing progs
cannot use bpf_spin_lock yet' with the change in the verifier
