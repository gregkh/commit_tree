ath11k: allocate smaller chunks of memory for firmware

On x86 it's sometimes difficult to allocate a large contigous DMA
memory, so instead allocate blocks of small chunk memory.

In ath11k_qmi_msg_mem_request_cb() the error handling was cleaned up to avoid
an unused variable warning. Also changed the test from (ret < 0) to just (ret)
as the functions don't return any positive values.
