RDMA/hns: Add interception for resizing SRQs

HIP08 doesn't support modifying the maximum number of outstanding WR in an
SRQ. However, the driver does not return a failure message, and users may
mistakenly think that the resizing is executed successfully. So the driver
needs to intercept this operation.
