tools, bpf/build: Cleanup feature files on make clean

The system for "Auto-detecting system features" located under
tools/build/ are (currently) used by perf, libbpf and bpftool. It can
contain stalled feature detection files, which are not cleaned up by
libbpf and bpftool on make clean (side-note: perf tool is correct).

Fix this by making the users invoke the make clean target.

Some details about the changes. The libbpf Makefile already had a
clean-config target (which seems to be copy-pasted from perf), but this
target was not "connected" (a make dependency) to clean target. Choose
not to rename target as someone might be using it. Did change the output
from "CLEAN config" to "CLEAN feature-detect", to make it more clear
what happens.
