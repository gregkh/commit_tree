Revert "io_uring: mark io_uring_fops/io_op_defs as __read_mostly"

This reverts commit 738277adc81929b3e7c9b63fec6693868cc5f931.

This change didn't make a lot of sense, and as Linus reports, it actually
fails on clang:

   /tmp/io_uring-dd40c4.s:26476: Warning: ignoring changed section
   attributes for .data..read_mostly

The arrays are already marked const so, by definition, they are not
just read-mostly, they are read-only.
