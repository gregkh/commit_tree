extcon: ptn5150: Use generic "interrupts" property

Interrupts do not have to be always GPIO based so instead of expecting
"int-gpios" property and converting the GPIO to an interrupt, just
accept any interrupt via generic "interrupts" property.

Keep support for old "int-gpios" for backward compatibility.
