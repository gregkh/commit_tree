btrfs: return error if we're unable to read device stats

I noticed when fixing device stats for seed devices that we simply threw
away the return value from btrfs_search_slot().  This is because we may
not have stat items, but we could very well get an error, and thus miss
reporting the error up the chain.

Fix this by returning ret if it's an actual error, and then stop trying
to init the rest of the devices stats and return the error up the chain.
