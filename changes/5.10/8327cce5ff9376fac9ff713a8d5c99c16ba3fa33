block: better deal with the delayed not supported case in blk_cloned_rq_check_limits

If WRITE_ZERO/WRITE_SAME operation is not supported by the storage,
blk_cloned_rq_check_limits() will return IO error which will cause
device-mapper to fail the paths.

Instead, if the queue limit is set to 0, return BLK_STS_NOTSUPP.
BLK_STS_NOTSUPP will be ignored by device-mapper and will not fail the
paths.
