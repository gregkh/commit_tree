selftests: mptcp: depends on built-in IPv6

Recently, CONFIG_MPTCP_IPV6 no longer selects CONFIG_IPV6. As a
consequence, if CONFIG_MPTCP_IPV6=y is added to the kconfig, it will no
longer ensure CONFIG_IPV6=y. If it is not enabled, CONFIG_MPTCP_IPV6
will stay disabled and selftests will fail.

We also need CONFIG_IPV6 to be built-in. For more details, please see
commit 0ed37ac586c0 ("mptcp: depends on IPV6 but not as a module").

Note that 'make kselftest-merge' will take all 'config' files found in
'tools/testsing/selftests'. Because some of them already set
CONFIG_IPV6=y, MPTCP selftests were still passing. But they will fail if
MPTCP selftests are launched manually after having executed this command
to prepare the kernel config:

  ./scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh -m .config \
      ./tools/testing/selftests/net/mptcp/config
