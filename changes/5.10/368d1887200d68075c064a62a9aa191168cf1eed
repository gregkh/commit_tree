x86/MCE/AMD, EDAC/mce_amd: Remove struct smca_hwid.xec_bitmap

The Extended Error Code Bitmap (xec_bitmap) for a Scalable MCA bank type
was intended to be used by the kernel to filter out invalid error codes
on a system. However, this is unnecessary after a few product releases
because the hardware will only report valid error codes. Thus, there's
no need for it with future systems.

Remove the xec_bitmap field and all references to it.
