can: peak_usb: fix potential integer overflow on shift of a int

The left shift of int 32 bit integer constant 1 is evaluated using 32 bit
arithmetic and then assigned to a signed 64 bit variable. In the case where
time_ref->adapter->ts_used_bits is 32 or more this can lead to an oveflow.
Avoid this by shifting using the BIT_ULL macro instead.
