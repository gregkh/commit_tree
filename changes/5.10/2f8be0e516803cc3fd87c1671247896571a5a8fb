drm/amd/display: Avoid set zero in the requested clk

[Why]
Sometimes CRTCs can be disabled due to display unplugging or temporarily
transition in the userspace; in these circumstances, DCE tries to set
the minimum clock threshold. When we have this situation, the function
bw_calcs is invoked with number_of_displays set to zero, making DCE set
dispclk_khz and sclk_khz to zero. For these reasons, we have seen some
ATOM bios errors that look like:

[drm:atom_op_jump [amdgpu]] *ERROR* atombios stuck in loop for more than
5secs aborting
[drm:amdgpu_atom_execute_table_locked [amdgpu]] *ERROR* atombios stuck
executing EA8A (len 761, WS 0, PS 0) @ 0xEABA

[How]
This error happens due to an attempt to optimize the bandwidth using the
sclk, and the dispclk clock set to zero. Technically we handle this in
the function dce112_set_clock, but we are not considering the case that
this value is set to zero. This commit fixes this issue by ensuring that
we never set a minimum value below the minimum clock threshold.
