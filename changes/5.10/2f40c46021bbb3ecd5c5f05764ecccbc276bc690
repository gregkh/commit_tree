KVM: arm64: Use fallback mapping sizes for contiguous huge page sizes

Although huge pages can be created out of multiple contiguous PMDs
or PTEs, the corresponding sizes are not supported at Stage-2 yet.

Instead of failing the mapping, fall back to the nearer supported
mapping size (CONT_PMD to PMD and CONT_PTE to PTE respectively).
