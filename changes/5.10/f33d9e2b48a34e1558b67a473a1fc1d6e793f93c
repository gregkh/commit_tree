usbnet: ipheth: fix connectivity with iOS 14

Starting with iOS 14 released in September 2020, connectivity using the
personal hotspot USB tethering function of iOS devices is broken.

Communication between the host and the device (for example ICMP traffic
or DNS resolution using the DNS service running in the device itself)
works fine, but communication to endpoints further away doesn't work.

Investigation on the matter shows that no UDP and ICMP traffic from the
tethered host is reaching the Internet at all. For TCP traffic there are
exchanges between tethered host and server but packets are modified in
transit leading to impossible communication.

After some trials Matti Vuorela discovered that reducing the URB buffer
size by two bytes restored the previous behavior. While a better
solution might exist to fix the issue, since the protocol is not
publicly documented and considering the small size of the fix, let's do
that.
