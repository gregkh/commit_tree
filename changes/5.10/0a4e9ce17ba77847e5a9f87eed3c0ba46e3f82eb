macb: support the two tx descriptors on at91rm9200

The at91rm9200 variant used by a few chips including the MSC313 supports
two Tx descriptors (one frame being serialized and another one queued).
However the driver only implemented a single one, which adds a dead time
after each transfer to receive and process the interrupt and wake the
queue up, preventing from reaching line rate.

This patch implements a very basic 2-deep queue to address this limitation.
The tests run on a Breadbee board equipped with an MSC313E show that at
1 GHz, HTTP traffic on medium-sized objects (45kB) was limited to exactly
50 Mbps before this patch, and jumped to 76 Mbps with this patch. And tests
on a single TCP stream with an MTU of 576 jump from 10kpps to 15kpps. With
1500 byte packets it's now possible to reach line rate versus 75 Mbps
before.
