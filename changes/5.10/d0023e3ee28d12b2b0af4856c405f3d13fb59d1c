docs: IOMMU user API

IOMMU UAPI is newly introduced to support communications between guest
virtual IOMMU and host IOMMU. There has been lots of discussions on how
it should work with VFIO UAPI and userspace in general.

This document is intended to clarify the UAPI design and usage. The
mechanics of how future extensions should be achieved are also covered
in this documentation.
