tools/memory-model: Improve litmus-test documentation

The current LKMM documentation says very little about litmus tests, and
worse yet directs people to the herd7 documentation for more information.
Now, the herd7 documentation is quite voluminous and educational,
but it is intended for people creating and modifying memory models,
not those attempting to use them.

This commit therefore updates README and creates a litmus-tests.txt
file that gives an overview of litmus-test format and describes ways of
modeling various special cases, illustrated with numerous examples.
