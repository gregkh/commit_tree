Revert "scsi: megaraid_sas: Added support for shared host tagset for cpuhotplug"

This reverts commit 103fbf8e4020845e4fcf63819288cedb092a3c91.

It turns out that it causes long boot-time latencies (to the point of
timeouts and failed boots).

The cause is the increase in request queues, and a fix for that is
queued up for 5.11, but we're reverting this commit that triggered the
problem for now.
