fork: introduce kernel_clone()

The old _do_fork() helper doesn't follow naming conventions of in-kernel
helpers for syscalls. The process creation cleanup in [1] didn't change the
name to something more reasonable mainly because _do_fork() was used in quite a
few places. So sending this as a separate series seemed the better strategy.

This commit does two things:
1. renames _do_fork() to kernel_clone() but keeps _do_fork() as a simple static
   inline wrapper around kernel_clone().
2. Changes the return type from long to pid_t. This aligns kernel_thread() and
   kernel_clone(). Also, the return value from kernel_clone that is surfaced in
   fork(), vfork(), clone(), and clone3() is taken from pid_vrn() which returns
   a pid_t too.

Follow-up patches will switch each caller of _do_fork() and each place where it
is referenced over to kernel_clone(). After all these changes are done, we can
remove _do_fork() completely and will only be left with kernel_clone().
