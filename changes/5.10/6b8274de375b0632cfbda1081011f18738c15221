leds: mt6323: use struct led_init_data when registering

By using struct led_init_data when registering we do not need to parse
`label` DT property. Moreover `label` is deprecated and if it is not
present but `color` and `function` are, LED core will compose a name
from these properties instead.

Since init_data is passed with fwnode handle, we do not need to set
the of_node member of the newly created LED classdev.
