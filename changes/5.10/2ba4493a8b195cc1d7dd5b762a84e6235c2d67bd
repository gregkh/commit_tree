KVM: nVMX: Explicitly check for valid guest state for !unrestricted guest

Call guest_state_valid() directly instead of querying emulation_required
when checking if L1 is attempting VM-Enter with invalid guest state.
If emulate_invalid_guest_state is false, KVM will fixup segment regs to
avoid emulation and will never set emulation_required, i.e. KVM will
incorrectly miss the associated consistency checks because the nested
path stuffs segments directly into vmcs02.

Opportunsitically add Consistency Check tracing to make future debug
suck a little less.

Fixes: 3184a995f782c ("KVM: nVMX: fix vmentry failure code when L2 state would require emulation")
