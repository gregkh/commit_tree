ibmvnic: improve ibmvnic_init and ibmvnic_reset_init

When H_SEND_CRQ command returns with H_CLOSED, it means the
server's CRQ is not ready yet. Instead of resetting immediately,
we wait for the server to launch passive init.
ibmvnic_init() and ibmvnic_reset_init() should also return the
error code from ibmvnic_send_crq_init() call.
