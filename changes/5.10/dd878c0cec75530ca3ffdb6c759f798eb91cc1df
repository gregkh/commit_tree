drm/i915: Dirty hack to fix selftests locking inversion

Some i915 selftests still use i915_vma_lock() as inner lock, and
intel_context_create_request() intel_timeline->mutex as outer lock.
Fortunately for selftests this is not an issue, they should be fixed
but we can move ahead and cleanify lockdep now.
