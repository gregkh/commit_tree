selftests: mptcp: interpret \n as a new line

In case of errors, this message was printed:

  (...)
  balanced bwidth with unbalanced delay       5233 max 5005  [ fail ]
  client exit code 0, server 0
  \nnetns ns3-0-EwnkPH socket stat for 10003:
  (...)

Obviously, the idea was to add a new line before the socket stat and not
print "\nnetns".

The commit 8b974778f998 ("selftests: mptcp: interpret \n as a new line")
is very similar to this one. But the modification in simult_flows.sh was
missed because this commit above was done in parallel to one here below.
