arm64: dts: qcom: pm8916: Remove invalid reg size from wcd_codec

Tha parent node of "wcd_codec" specifies #address-cells = <1>
and #size-cells = <0>, which means that each resource should be
described by one cell for the address and size omitted.

However, wcd_codec currently lists 0x200 as second cell (probably
the size of the resource). When parsing this would be treated like
another memory resource - which is entirely wrong.

To quote the device tree specification [1]:
  "If the parent node specifies a value of 0 for #size-cells,
   the length field in the value of reg shall be omitted."
