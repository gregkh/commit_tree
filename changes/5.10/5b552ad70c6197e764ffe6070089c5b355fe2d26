ext4: drop redundant calls ext4_fc_track_range

ext4_fc_track_range() should only be called when blocks are added or
removed from an inode. So, the only places from where we need to call
this function are ext4_map_blocks(), punch hole, collapse / zero
range, truncate. Remove all the other redundant calls to ths function.
