drm/i915: Keep the most recently used active-fence upon discard

Whenever an i915_active idles, we prune its tree of old fence slots to
prevent a gradual leak should it be used to track many, many timelines.
The downside is that we then have to frequently reallocate the rbtree.
A compromise is that we keep the most recently used fence slot, and
reuse that for the next active reference as that is the most likely
timeline to be reused.
