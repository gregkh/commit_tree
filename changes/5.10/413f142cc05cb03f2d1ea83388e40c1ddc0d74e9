ibmveth: Identify ingress large send packets.

Ingress large send packets are identified by either:
The IBMVETH_RXQ_LRG_PKT flag in the receive buffer
or with a -1 placed in the ip header checksum.
The method used depends on firmware version. Frame
geometry and sufficient header validation is performed by the
hypervisor eliminating the need for further header checks here.
