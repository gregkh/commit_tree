coresight: etm: perf: Fix warning caused by etm_setup_aux failure

When coresight_build_path() fails on all the cpus, etm_setup_aux
calls etm_free_aux() to free allocated event_data.
WARN_ON(cpumask_empty(mask) will be triggered since cpu mask is empty.
Check event_data->snk_config is not NULL first to avoid this
warning.
