KVM: VMX: Rename vmx_*_supported() helpers to cpu_has_vmx_*()

Rename helpers for a few controls to conform to the more prevelant style
of cpu_has_vmx_<feature>().  Consistent names will allow adding macros
to consolidate the boilerplate code for adjusting secondary execution
controls.

No functional change intended.
