memory: tegra: Remove GPU from DRM IOMMU group

Commit 63a613fdb16c ("memory: tegra: Add gr2d and gr3d to DRM IOMMU
group") added the GPU to the DRM IOMMU group, which doesn't make any
sense. This causes problems when Nouveau tries to attach to the SMMU
and causes it to fall back to using the DMA API.

Remove the GPU from the DRM groups to restore the old behaviour. The
GPU should always have its own IOMMU domain to make sure it can map
buffers into contiguous chunks (for big page support) without getting
in the way of mappings from the DRM group.
