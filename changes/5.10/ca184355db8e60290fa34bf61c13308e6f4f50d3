ALSA: hda/realtek: Enable audio jacks of ASUS D700SA with ALC887

The ASUS D700SA desktop's audio (1043:2390) with ALC887 cannot detect
the headset microphone and another headphone jack until
ALC887_FIXUP_ASUS_HMIC and ALC887_FIXUP_ASUS_AUDIO quirks are applied.
The NID 0x15 maps as the headset microphone and NID 0x19 maps as another
headphone jack. Also need the function like alc887_fixup_asus_jack to
enable the audio jacks.
