i2c: core: Restore acpi_walk_dep_device_list() getting called after registering the ACPI i2c devs

Commit 21653a4181ff ("i2c: core: Call i2c_acpi_install_space_handler()
before i2c_acpi_register_devices()")'s intention was to only move the
acpi_install_address_space_handler() call to the point before where
the ACPI declared i2c-children of the adapter where instantiated by
i2c_acpi_register_devices().

But i2c_acpi_install_space_handler() had a call to
acpi_walk_dep_device_list() hidden (that is I missed it) at the end
of it, so as an unwanted side-effect now acpi_walk_dep_device_list()
was also being called before i2c_acpi_register_devices().

Move the acpi_walk_dep_device_list() call to the end of
i2c_acpi_register_devices(), so that it is once again called *after*
the i2c_client-s hanging of the adapter have been created.

This fixes the Microsoft Surface Go 2 hanging at boot.
