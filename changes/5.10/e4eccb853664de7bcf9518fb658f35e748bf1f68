vfio/pci: Bypass IGD init in case of -ENODEV

Bypass the IGD initialization when -ENODEV returns,
that should be the case if opregion is not available for IGD
or within discrete graphics device's option ROM,
or host/lpc bridge is not found.

Then use of -ENODEV here means no special device resources found
which needs special care for VFIO, but we still allow other normal
device resource access.
