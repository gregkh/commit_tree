interconnect: Introduce xlate_extended() callback

Currently there is the xlate() callback, which is used by providers for
mapping the nodes from phandle arguments. That's fine for simple mappings,
but the phandle arguments could contain an additional data, such as tag
information. Let's create another callback xlate_extended() for the cases
where providers want also populate the path tag data.
