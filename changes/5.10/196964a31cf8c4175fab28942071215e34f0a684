fsi: core: Set slave local bus ownership during init

The driver ought to claim local bus ownership of the slave it's
communicating with.

This is for multi-master setups. The slave (in theory) will deny access
to masters who try to access the CFAM address space but who don't "own"
the bus.

As driver doesn't seem to perform any other teardown there is no need to
"un-claim" ownership at teardown. Also I'm not aware of any multi-master
setup using this driver so it shouldn't actually matter. Also, the
hardware doesn't seem to enforce this despite being required in the
specification...
