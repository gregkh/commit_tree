mei: protect mei_cl_mtu from null dereference

A receive callback is queued while the client is still connected
but can still be called after the client was disconnected. Upon
disconnect cl->me_cl is set to NULL, hence we need to check
that ME client is not-NULL in mei_cl_mtu to avoid
null dereference.
