ice: add additional debug logging for firmware update

While debugging a recent failure to update the flash of an ice device,
I found it helpful to add additional logging which helped determine the
root cause of the problem being a timeout issue.

Add some extra dev_dbg() logging messages which can be enabled using the
dynamic debug facility, including one for ice_aq_wait_for_event that
will use jiffies to capture a rough estimate of how long we waited for
the completion of a firmware command.
