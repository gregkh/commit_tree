bcache: remove can_attach_cache()

After removing the embedded struct cache_sb from struct cache_set, cache
set will directly reference the in-memory super block of struct cache.
It is unnecessary to compare block_size, bucket_size and nr_in_set from
the identical in-memory super block in can_attach_cache().

This is a preparation patch for latter removing cache_set->sb from
struct cache_set.
