bpf: verifier: refactor check_attach_btf_id()

The check_attach_btf_id() function really does three things:

1. It performs a bunch of checks on the program to ensure that the
   attachment is valid.

2. It stores a bunch of state about the attachment being requested in
   the verifier environment and struct bpf_prog objects.

3. It allocates a trampoline for the attachment.

This patch splits out (1.) and (3.) into separate functions which will
perform the checks, but return the computed values instead of directly
modifying the environment. This is done in preparation for reusing the
checks when the actual attachment is happening, which will allow tracing
programs to have multiple (compatible) attachments.

This also fixes a bug where a bunch of checks were skipped if a trampoline
already existed for the tracing target.
