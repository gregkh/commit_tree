EDAC/i5100: Fix error handling order in i5100_init_one()

When pci_get_device_func() fails, the driver doesn't need to execute
pci_dev_put(). mci should still be freed, though, to prevent a memory
leak. When pci_enable_device() fails, the error injection PCI device
"einj" doesn't need to be disabled either.

 [ bp: Massage commit message, rename label to "bail_mc_free". ]
