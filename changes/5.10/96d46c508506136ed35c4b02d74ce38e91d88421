bpf: selftest: Ensure the child sk inherited all bpf_sock_ops_cb_flags

This patch adds a test to ensure the child sk inherited everything
from the bpf_sock_ops_cb_flags of the listen sk:
1. Sets one more cb_flags (BPF_SOCK_OPS_STATE_CB_FLAG) to the listen sk
   in test_tcp_hdr_options.c
2. Saves the skops->bpf_sock_ops_cb_flags when handling the newly
   established passive connection
3. CHECK() it is the same as the listen sk

This also covers the fastopen case as the existing test_tcp_hdr_options.c
does.
