ASoC: sun8i-codec: Sort DAPM controls, widgets, and routes

Sort the remaining pieces of the DAPM driver so that they are all in the
same order among controls/widgets/routes, and so they roughly match the
register word and bit order of the hardware. This nicely separates the
AIF-related widgets from the ADC/DAC widgets, which allows the AIF
widgets to stay in a logical order as more AIFs are added to the driver.

No widgets are renamed, to ease verification that this commit makes no
functional change.
