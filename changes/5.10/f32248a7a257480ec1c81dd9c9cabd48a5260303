wcn36xx: Use existing pointers in wcn36xx_smd_config_bss_v1

Two pointers are already defined in this function "bss" and "sta" which
point to fields within msg_body->bss_params.

We can substantially reduce the amount of extraneous text in this function
by making use of those pointers. This change makes the code easier to read
and modify.
