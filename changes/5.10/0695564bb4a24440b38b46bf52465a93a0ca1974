nexthop: Only emit a notification when nexthop is actually deleted

Currently, the in-kernel delete notification is emitted from the error
path of nexthop_add() and replace_nexthop(), which can be confusing to
in-kernel listeners as they are not familiar with the nexthop.

Instead, only emit the notification when the nexthop is actually
deleted. The following sub-cases are covered:

1. User space deletes the nexthop
2. The nexthop is deleted by the kernel due to a netdev event (e.g.,
   nexthop device going down)
3. A group is deleted because its last nexthop is being deleted
4. The network namespace of the nexthop device is deleted
