xfs: force the log after remapping a synchronous-writes file

Commit 5833112df7e9 tried to make it so that a remap operation would
force the log out to disk if the filesystem is mounted with mandatory
synchronous writes.  Unfortunately, that commit failed to handle the
case where the inode or the file descriptor require mandatory
synchronous writes.

Refactor the check into into a helper that will look for all three
conditions, and now we can treat reflink just like any other synchronous
write.
