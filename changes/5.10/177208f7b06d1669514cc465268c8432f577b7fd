arm64: tegra: Add DT binding for AHUB components

Bindings for following modules are added.
 * AHUB added as a child node under ACONNECT
 * AHUB includes many HW accelerators and below components are added
   as its children.
   * ADMAIF
   * I2S
   * DMIC
   * DSPK (added for Tegra186 and Tegra194 only, since Tegra210 does
     not have this module)
