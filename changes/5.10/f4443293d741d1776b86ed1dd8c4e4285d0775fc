brcmsmac: fix memory leak in wlc_phy_attach_lcnphy

When wlc_phy_txpwr_srom_read_lcnphy fails in wlc_phy_attach_lcnphy,
the allocated pi->u.pi_lcnphy is leaked, since struct brcms_phy will be
freed in the caller function.

Fix this by calling wlc_phy_detach_lcnphy in the error handler of
wlc_phy_txpwr_srom_read_lcnphy before returning.
