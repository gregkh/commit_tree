soundwire: intel: don't manage link power individually

Each link has separate power controls, but experimental results show
we need to use an all-or-none approach to the link power management.

This change has marginal power impacts, the DSP needs to be powered
anyways before SoundWire links can be powered, and even when powered a
link can be in clock-stopped mode.
