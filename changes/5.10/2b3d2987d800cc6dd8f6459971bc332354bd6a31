ALSA: firewire: Replace tasklet with work

The tasklet is an old API that should be deprecated, usually can be
converted to another decent API.  In FireWire driver, a tasklet is
still used for offloading the AMDTP PCM stream handling.  It can be
achieved gracefully with a work queued, too.

This patch replaces the tasklet usage in firewire-lib driver with a
simple work.  The conversion is fairly straightforward but for the
in_interrupt() checks that are replaced with the check using the
current_work().

Note that in_interrupt() in amdtp_packet tracepoint is still kept as
is.  This is the place that is probed by both softirq of 1394 OHCI and
a user task of a PCM application, and the work handling is already
filtered in amdtp_domain_stream_pcm_pointer().
