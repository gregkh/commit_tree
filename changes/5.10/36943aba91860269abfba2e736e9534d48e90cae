arm64: mte: Enable swap of tagged pages

When swapping pages out to disk it is necessary to save any tags that
have been set, and restore when swapping back in. Make use of the new
page flag (PG_ARCH_2, locally named PG_mte_tagged) to identify pages
with tags. When swapping out these pages the tags are stored in memory
and later restored when the pages are brought back in. Because shmem can
swap pages back in without restoring the userspace PTE it is also
necessary to add a hook for shmem.
