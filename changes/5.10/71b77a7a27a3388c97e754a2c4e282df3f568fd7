enetc: Migrate to PHYLINK and PCS_LYNX

This is a methodical transition of the driver from phylib
to phylink, following the guidelines from sfp-phylink.rst.
The MAC register configurations based on interface mode
were moved from the probing path to the mac_config() hook.
MAC enable and disable commands (enabling Rx and Tx paths
at MAC level) were also extracted and assigned to their
corresponding phylink hooks.
As part of the migration to phylink, the serdes configuration
from the driver was offloaded to the PCS_LYNX module,
introduced in commit 0da4c3d393e4 ("net: phy: add Lynx PCS module"),
the PCS_LYNX module being a mandatory component required to
make the enetc driver work with phylink.
