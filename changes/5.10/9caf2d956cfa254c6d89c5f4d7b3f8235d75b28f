interconnect: qcom: msm8974: Don't boost the NoC rate during boot

It has been reported that on Fairphone 2 (msm8974-based), increasing
the clock rate for some of the NoCs during boot may lead to hangs.
Let's restore the original behavior and not touch the clock rate of
any of the NoCs to fix the regression.
