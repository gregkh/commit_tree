platform/x86: hp-wmi: add support for thermal policy

HP Spectre notebooks (and probably other model as well)
support up to 4 thermal policy:
 - HP Recommended
 - Performance
 - Cool
 - Quiet

at least on HP Spectre x360 Convertible 15-df0xxx the firmware sets the
thermal policy to default but hardcode the odvp0 variable to 1, this causes
thermald to choose the wrong DPTF profile witch result in low performance
when notebook is on AC, calling thermal policy write command allow firmware
to correctly set the odvp0 variable.
