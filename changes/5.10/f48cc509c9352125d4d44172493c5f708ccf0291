Revert "PCI: brcmstb: Wait for Raspberry Pi's firmware when present"

This reverts commit 44331189f9082c7e659697bbac1747db3def73e7.

Now that the VL805 init routine is run through a reset controller driver
the device dependencies are being taken care of by the device core. No
need to do it manually here.
