drm: bridge: dw-hdmi: Avoid resetting force in the detect function

It has been observed that resetting force in the detect function can
result in the PHY being powered down in response to hot-plug detect
being asserted, even when the HDMI connector is forced on.

Enabling debug messages and adding a call to dump_stack() in
dw_hdmi_phy_power_off() shows the following in dmesg:
[  160.637413] dwhdmi-rockchip ff940000.hdmi: EVENT=plugin
[  160.637433] dwhdmi-rockchip ff940000.hdmi: PHY powered down in 0 iterations

Call trace:
dw_hdmi_phy_power_off
dw_hdmi_phy_disable
dw_hdmi_update_power
dw_hdmi_detect
dw_hdmi_connector_detect
drm_helper_probe_detect_ctx
drm_helper_hpd_irq_event
