drm/managed: Cleanup of unused functions and polishing docs

Following functions are only used internally, not by drivers:
- devm_drm_dev_init

Also, now that we have a very slick and polished way to allocate a
drm_device with devm_drm_dev_alloc, update all the docs to reflect the
new reality. Mostly this consists of deleting old and misleading
hints. Two main ones:

- it is no longer required that the drm_device base class is first in
  the structure. devm_drm_dev_alloc can cope with it being anywhere

- obviously embedded now strongly recommends using devm_drm_dev_alloc

v2: Fix typos (Noralf)

v3: Split out the removal of drm_dev_init, that's blocked on some
discussions on how to convert vgem/vkms/i915-selftests. Adjust commit
message to reflect that.
