drm/vc4: kms: Don't disable the muxing of an active CRTC

The current HVS muxing code will consider the CRTCs in a given state to
setup their muxing in the HVS, and disable the other CRTCs muxes.

However, it's valid to only update a single CRTC with a state, and in this
situation we would mux out a CRTC that was enabled but left untouched by
the new state.

Fix this by setting a flag on the CRTC state when the muxing has been
changed, and only change the muxing configuration when that flag is there.
