IB/srpt: docs: add a description for cq_size member

Changeset c804af2c1d31 ("IB/srpt: use new shared CQ mechanism")
added a new member for struct srpt_rdma_ch, but didn't add the
corresponding kernel-doc markup, as repoted when doing
"make htmldocs":

	./drivers/infiniband/ulp/srpt/ib_srpt.h:331: warning: Function parameter or member 'cq_size' not described in 'srpt_rdma_ch'

Add a description for it.
