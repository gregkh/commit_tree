pinctrl: intel: Set default bias in case no particular value given

When GPIO library asks pin control to set the bias, it doesn't pass
any value of it and argument is considered boolean (and this is true
for ACPI GpioIo() / GpioInt() resources, by the way). Thus, individual
drivers must behave well, when they got the resistance value of 1 Ohm,
i.e. transforming it to sane default.

In case of Intel pin control hardware the 5 kOhm sounds plausible
because on one hand it's a minimum of resistors present in all
hardware generations and at the same time it's high enough to minimize
leakage current (will be only 200 uA with the above choice).
