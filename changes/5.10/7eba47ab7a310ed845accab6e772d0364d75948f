media: staging: rkisp1: cap: protect access to buf with the spin lock

The function 'rkisp1_stream_start' calls 'rkisp1_set_next_buf'
which access the buffers, so the call should be protected by
taking the cap->buf.lock.
After this patch, all locks are reviewed and commented so remove
the TODO item "review and comment every lock"
