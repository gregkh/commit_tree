RDMA/core: Constify struct attribute_group

The only usage of the pma_table field in the ib_port struct is to pass its
address to sysfs_create_group() and sysfs_remove_group(). Make it const to
make it possible to constify a couple of static struct
attribute_group. This allows the compiler to put them in read-only memory.
