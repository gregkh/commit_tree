net/mlx5e: Tc nic flows to use mlx5_chains flow tables

Change nic tc flows offload path to use the chains and prios
infrastructure for the flow table creation as a preparation to
support tc multi chains and priorities for nic flows.

Adding an instance of the table chaining database to the nic tc struct
and perform the root table creation and desctuction via the chains api
while keeping the limit of a single chain (0) in nic tc mode.
This will be extendable to supporting multiple chains in the following
patches.

The flow table sizes and default miss table parameters that are provided
to the chains creation api are kept the same.
