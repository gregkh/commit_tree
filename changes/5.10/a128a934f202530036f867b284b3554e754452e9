KVM: VMX: Rename "vmx_find_msr_index" to "vmx_find_loadstore_msr_slot"

Add "loadstore" to vmx_find_msr_index() to differentiate it from the so
called shared MSRs helpers (which will soon be renamed), and replace
"index" with "slot" to better convey that the helper returns slot in the
array, not the MSR index (the value that gets stuffed into ECX).

No functional change intended.
