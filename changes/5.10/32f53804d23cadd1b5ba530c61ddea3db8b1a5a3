staging: regulator: hi6421v600-regulator: cleanup struct hisi_regulator

There are several fields on this struct that can be removed,
as they already exists at struct regulator_desc.

Remove them, cleaning up the code in the process.

While here, rename it to hi6421v600_regulator_info, in order
to better match the driver's name.
