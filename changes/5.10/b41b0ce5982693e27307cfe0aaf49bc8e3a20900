interconnect: Add bulk API helpers

There are drivers which just need to get multiple interconnect paths,
request some predefined amounts of bandwidth and then just toggle the
paths between enabled/disabled state.

The aim of this patch is simplify the above and to allow drivers to put
all the path names and bandwidth data into a single static icc_bulk_data
table and call the icc_bulk_* functions on that table in order to scale
all the interconnect paths in parallel.
