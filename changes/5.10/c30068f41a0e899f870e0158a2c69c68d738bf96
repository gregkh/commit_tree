rcu/trace: Print negative GP numbers correctly

GP numbers start from -300 and gp_seq numbers start of -1200 (for a
shift of 2). These negative numbers are printed as unsigned long which
not only takes up more text space, but is rather confusing to the reader
as they have to constantly expend energy to truncate the number. Just
print the negative numbering directly.
