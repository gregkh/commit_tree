USB: cdc-acm: clean up no-union-descriptor handling

For interfaces that lack a union descriptor, probe for a
"combined-interface" before falling back to the call-management
descriptor instead of the other way round.

This allows for the removal of the NO_DATA_INTERFACE quirk and makes the
probe algorithm somewhat easier to follow.
