regulator: qcom_smd: Add PM660/PM660L regulator support

The PM660 and PM660L are a very very common PMIC combo, found on
boards using the SDM630, SDM636, SDM660 (and SDA variants) SoC.

PM660 provides 6 SMPS and 19 LDOs (of which one is unaccesible),
while PM660L provides 5 SMPS (of which S3 and S4 are combined),
10 LDOs and a Buck-or-Boost (BoB) regulator.

The PM660L IC also provides other regulators that are very
specialized (for example, for the display) and will be managed
in the other appropriate drivers (for example, labibb).
