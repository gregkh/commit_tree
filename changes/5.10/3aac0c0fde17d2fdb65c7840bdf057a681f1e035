scsi: qla2xxx: Honor status qualifier in FCP_RSP per spec

FCP-4 (referred FCP-4 rev-2b) identifies the earlier known "retry delay
timer" field as "status qualifier", which is described in SAM-5 and later
specs. This fix makes appropriate driver side modifications to honor the
new definition. The SAM document referred was SAM-6 rev-5.
