serial: 8250_fsl: Add ACPI support

This adds support for ACPI enumerated FSL 16550 UARTs.
For supporting ACPI, I added a wrapper so that this driver
can be used if firmware has exposed the HID "NXP0018" in
DSDT table.

This will be built as object file if config "SERIAL_8250_FSL"
is enabled which depends on config "SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE".
