tcp: consistently check retransmit hint

tcp_simple_retransmit() used for path MTU discovery may not adjust
the retransmit hint properly by deducting retrans_out before checking
it to adjust the hint. This patch fixes this by a correct routine
tcp_mark_skb_lost() already used by the RACK loss detection.
