gfs2: add validation checks for size of superblock

In gfs2_check_sb(), no validation checks are performed with regards to
the size of the superblock.
syzkaller detected a slab-out-of-bounds bug that was primarily caused
because the block size for a superblock was set to zero.
A valid size for a superblock is a power of 2 between 512 and PAGE_SIZE.
Performing validation checks and ensuring that the size of the superblock
is valid fixes this bug.
