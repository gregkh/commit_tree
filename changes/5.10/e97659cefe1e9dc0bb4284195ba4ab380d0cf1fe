btrfs: use unaligned helpers for stack and header set/get helpers

In the definitions generated by BTRFS_SETGET_HEADER_FUNCS there's direct
pointer assignment but we should use the helpers for unaligned access
for clarity. It hasn't been a problem so far because of the natural
alignment.

Similarly for BTRFS_SETGET_STACK_FUNCS, that usually get a structure
from stack that has an aligned start but some members may not be aligned
due to packing. This as well hasn't caused problems so far.

Move the put/get_unaligned_le8 stubs to ctree.h so we can use them.
