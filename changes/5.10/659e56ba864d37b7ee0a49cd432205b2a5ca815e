block: add a new revalidate_disk_size helper

revalidate_disk is a relative awkward helper for driver use, as it first
calls an optional driver method and then updates the block device size,
while most callers either don't need the method call at all, or want to
keep state between the caller and the called method.

Add a revalidate_disk_size helper that just performs the update of the
block device size from the gendisk one, and switch all drivers that do
not implement ->revalidate_disk to use the new helper instead of
revalidate_disk()
