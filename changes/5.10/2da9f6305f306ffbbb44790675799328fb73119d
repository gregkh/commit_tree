mm/vmscan: fix NR_ISOLATED_FILE corruption on 64-bit

Previously the negated unsigned long would be cast back to signed long
which would have the correct negative value.  After commit 730ec8c01a2b
("mm/vmscan.c: change prototype for shrink_page_list"), the large
unsigned int converts to a large positive signed long.

Symptoms include CMA allocations hanging forever holding the cma_mutex
due to alloc_contig_range->...->isolate_migratepages_block waiting
forever in "while (unlikely(too_many_isolated(pgdat)))".

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: fix -stat.nr_lazyfree_fail as well, per Michal]
