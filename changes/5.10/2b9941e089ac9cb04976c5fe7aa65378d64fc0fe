PCI / thunderbolt: Switch to use device links instead of PCI quirk

On older Apple systems there is currently a PCI quirk in place to block
resume of tunneled PCIe ports until NHI (Thunderbolt controller) is
resumed. This makes sure the PCIe tunnels are re-established before PCI
core notices it.

With device links the same thing can be done without quirks. The driver
core will make sure the supplier (NHI) is resumed before consumers (PCIe
downstream ports).

For this reason switch the Thunderbolt driver to use device links and
remove the PCI quirk.
