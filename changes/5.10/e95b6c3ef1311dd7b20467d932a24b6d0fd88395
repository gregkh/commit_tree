xfs: fix the minrecs logic when dealing with inode root child blocks

The comment and logic in xchk_btree_check_minrecs for dealing with
inode-rooted btrees isn't quite correct.  While the direct children of
the inode root are allowed to have fewer records than what would
normally be allowed for a regular ondisk btree block, this is only true
if there is only one child block and the number of records don't fit in
the inode root.
