r8169: remove member irq_enabled from struct rtl8169_private

After making use of the gro_flush_timeout attribute I once got a
tx timeout due to an interrupt that wasn't handled. Seems using
irq_enabled can be racy, and it's not needed any longer anyway,
so remove it. I've never seen a report about such a race before,
therefore treat the change as an improvement.

There's just one small drawback: If a legacy PCI interrupt is used,
and if this interrupt is shared with a device with high interrupt
rate, then we may handle interrupts even if NAPI disabled them,
and we may see a certain performance decrease under high network load.
