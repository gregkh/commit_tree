dt-bindings: ili9881c: add compatible string for Feixin K101-IM2BYL02

Feixin K101-IM2BYL02 is a drop-in replacement of K101-IM2BA02 panel
(which is already supported by panel-feixin-k101-im2ba02 driver) with
the same pinout. It utilizes an Ilitek ILI9881C controller chip, so its
compatible string should be added to ilitek,ili9881c file.

Add the compatible string for it.
