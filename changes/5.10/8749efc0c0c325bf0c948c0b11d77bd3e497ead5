Revert "printk: lock/unlock console only for new logbuf entries"

This reverts commit 3ac37a93fa9217e576bebfd4ba3e80edaaeb2289.

This optimization will not apply once the transition to a lockless
printk is complete. Rather than porting this optimization through
the transition only to remove it anyway, just revert it now to
simplify the transition.
