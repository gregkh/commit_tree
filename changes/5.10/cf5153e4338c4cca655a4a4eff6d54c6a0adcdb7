media: gpu: host1x: mipi: Keep MIPI clock enabled and mutex locked till calibration done

With the split of MIPI calibration into tegra_mipi_calibrate() and
tegra_mipi_wait(), MIPI clock is not kept enabled and mutex is not locked
till the calibration is done.

So, this patch keeps MIPI clock enabled and mutex locked after triggering
start of calibration till its done.

To let calibration process go through its finite sequence codes before
calibration logic waiting for pads idle state added wait time of 75usec
to make sure it sees idle state to apply the results.

This patch renames tegra_mipi_calibrate() as tegra_mipi_start_calibration()
and tegra_mipi_wait() as tegra_mipi_finish_calibration() to be inline
with their usage.
