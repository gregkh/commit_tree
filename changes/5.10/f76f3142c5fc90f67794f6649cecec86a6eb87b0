spi: dw: Update SPI bus speed in a config function

The SPI bus speed update functionality will be useful in another parts of
the driver too (like to implement the SPI memory operations and from the
DW SPI glue layers). Let's move it to the update_cr0() method then and
since the later is now updating not only the CTRLR0 register alter its
prototype to have a generic function name not related to CR0.

Leave the too long line with the chip->clk_div setting as is for now,
since it's going to be changed later anyway.
