mmc: moxart: remove unneeded check for drvdata

The 'struct mmc_host *mmc' comes from drvdata set at the end of probe,
so it cannot be NULL.  The code already dereferences it few lines before
the check with mmc_priv().  This also fixes smatch warning:

  drivers/mmc/host/moxart-mmc.c:692 moxart_remove() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'mmc' (see line 688)
