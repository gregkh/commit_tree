ACPICA: Add predefined names found in the SMBus sepcification

Affects run-time (kernel) ACPICA, iASL, and acpi_help. The "SMBus
Control Method Interface Specification, Version 1.0, December 10,
1999" containes predefined names: _SBA _SBI _SBR _SBT _SBW. This was
done outside of the ACPI specification. This commit adds support for
ACPICA to recognize these named objects as predefined named objects.
