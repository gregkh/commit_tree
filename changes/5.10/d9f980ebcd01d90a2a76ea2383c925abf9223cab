drm/tegra: output: rgb: Wrap directly-connected panel into DRM bridge

Currently Tegra DRM driver manually manages display panel, but this
management could be moved out into DRM core if we'll wrap panel into
DRM bridge. This patch wraps RGB panel into a DRM bridge and removes
manual handling of the panel from the RGB output code.
