mm: update the documentation for vfree

Patch series "remove alloc_vm_area", v4.

This series removes alloc_vm_area, which was left over from the big
vmalloc interface rework.  It is a rather arkane interface, basicaly the
equivalent of get_vm_area + actually faulting in all PTEs in the allocated
area.  It was originally addeds for Xen (which isn't modular to start
with), and then grew users in zsmalloc and i915 which seems to mostly
qualify as abuses of the interface, especially for i915 as a random driver
should not set up PTE bits directly.

This patch (of 11):

 * Document that you can call vfree() on an address returned from vmap()
 * Remove the note about the minimum size -- the minimum size of a vmalloc
   allocation is one page
 * Add a Context: section
 * Fix capitalisation
 * Reword the prohibition on calling from NMI context to avoid a double
   negative
