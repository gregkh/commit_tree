KVM: arm64: Fix handling of merging tables into a block entry

When dirty logging is enabled, we collapse block entries into tables
as necessary. If dirty logging gets canceled, we can end-up merging
tables back into block entries.

When this happens, we must not only free the non-huge page-table
pages but also invalidate all the TLB entries that can potentially
cover the block. Otherwise, we end-up with multiple possible translations
for the same physical page, which can legitimately result in a TLB
conflict.

To address this, replease the bogus invalidation by IPA with a full
VM invalidation. Although this is pretty heavy handed, it happens
very infrequently and saves a bunch of invalidations by IPA.
