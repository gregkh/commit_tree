rcutorture: Properly synchronize with OOM notifier

The current rcutorture forward-progress code assumes that it is the
only cause of out-of-memory (OOM) events.  For script-based rcutorture
testing, this assumption is in fact correct.  However, testing based
on modprobe/rmmod might well encounter external OOM events, which could
happen at any time.

This commit therefore properly synchronizes the interaction between
rcutorture's forward-progress testing and its OOM notifier by adding a
global mutex.
