soundwire: intel_init: handle power rail dependencies for clock stop mode

When none of the clock stop quirks is specified, the Master IP will
assume the context is preserved and will not reset the Bus and restart
enumeration. Due to power rail dependencies, the HDaudio controller
needs to remain powered and prevented from executing its pm_runtime
suspend routine.

This choice of course has a power impact, and this mode should only be
selected when latency requirements are critical or the parent device
can enter D0ix modes.
