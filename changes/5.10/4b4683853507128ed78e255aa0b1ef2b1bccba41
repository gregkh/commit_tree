drivers/net/wan/x25_asy: Remove an unnecessary x25_type_trans call

x25_type_trans only needs to be called before we call netif_rx to pass
the skb to upper layers.

It does not need to be called before lapb_data_received. The LAPB module
does not need the fields that are set by calling it.

In the other two X.25 drivers - lapbether and hdlc_x25. x25_type_trans
is only called before netif_rx and not before lapb_data_received.
