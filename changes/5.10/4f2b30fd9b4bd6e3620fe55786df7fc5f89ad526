fs: dlm: fix race in nodeid2con

This patch fixes a race in nodeid2con in cases that we parallel running
a lookup and both will create a connection structure for the same nodeid.
It's a rare case to create a new connection structure to keep reader
lockless we just do a lookup inside the protection area again and drop
previous work if this race happens.
