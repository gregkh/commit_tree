net: dsa: tag_brcm: use generic flow dissector procedure

There are 2 Broadcom tags in use, one places the DSA tag before the
Ethernet destination MAC address, and the other before the EtherType.
Nonetheless, both displace the rest of the headers, so this tagger can
use the generic flow dissector procedure which accounts for that.

The ASCII art drawing is a good reference though, so keep it but move it
somewhere else.
