iwlwifi: acpi: rename geo structs to contain versioning

Add the version number to the iwl_geo_tx_power_profile_cmd structs and
move the union into a common place.  Additionally, reuse the code that
sets elements that are at the same place in the struct across
different versions.

While at it remove an unused variable, add a comment and move the v2
specific element setting to inside the if statement.  Additionally,
invert the if for slightly more readability.
