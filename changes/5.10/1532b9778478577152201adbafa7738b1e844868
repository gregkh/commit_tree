net: Have netpoll bring-up DSA management interface

DSA network devices rely on having their DSA management interface up and
running otherwise their ndo_open() will return -ENETDOWN. Without doing
this it would not be possible to use DSA devices as netconsole when
configured on the command line. These devices also do not utilize the
upper/lower linking so the check about the netpoll device having upper
is not going to be a problem.

The solution adopted here is identical to the one done for
net/ipv4/ipconfig.c with 728c02089a0e ("net: ipv4: handle DSA enabled
master network devices"), with the network namespace scope being
restricted to that of the process configuring netpoll.
