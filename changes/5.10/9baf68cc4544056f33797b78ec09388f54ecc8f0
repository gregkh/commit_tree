edac,ghes,cper: Add Row Extension to Memory Error Record

Memory errors could be printed with incorrect row values since the DIMM
size has outgrown the 16 bit row field in the CPER structure. UEFI
Specification Version 2.8 has increased the size of row by allowing it to
use the first 2 bits from a previously reserved space within the structure.

When needed, add the extension bits to the row value printed.

Based on UEFI 2.8 Table 299. Memory Error Record
