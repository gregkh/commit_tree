KVM: x86: SVM: Prevent MSR passthrough when MSR access is denied

We will introduce the concept of MSRs that may not be handled in kernel
space soon. Some MSRs are directly passed through to the guest, effectively
making them handled by KVM from user space's point of view.

This patch introduces all logic required to ensure that MSRs that
user space wants trapped are not marked as direct access for guests.
