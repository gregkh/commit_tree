selftests: bpf: Test sockmap update from BPF

Add a test which copies a socket from a sockmap into another sockmap
or sockhash. This excercises bpf_map_update_elem support from BPF
context. Compare the socket cookies from source and destination to
ensure that the copy succeeded.

Also check that the verifier rejects map_update from unsafe contexts.
