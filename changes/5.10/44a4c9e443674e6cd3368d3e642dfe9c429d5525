parisc: Add wrapper syscalls to fix O_NONBLOCK flag usage

The commit 75ae04206a4d ("parisc: Define O_NONBLOCK to become
000200000") changed the O_NONBLOCK constant to have only one bit set
(like all other architectures). This change broke some existing
userspace code (e.g.  udevadm, systemd-udevd, elogind) which called
specific syscalls which do strict value checking on their flag
parameter.

This patch adds wrapper functions for the relevant syscalls. The
wrappers masks out any old invalid O_NONBLOCK flags, reports in the
syslog if the old O_NONBLOCK value was used and then calls the target
syscall with the new O_NONBLOCK value.
