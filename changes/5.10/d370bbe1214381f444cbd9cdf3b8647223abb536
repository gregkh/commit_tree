bpf/libbpf: BTF support for typed ksyms

If a ksym is defined with a type, libbpf will try to find the ksym's btf
information from kernel btf. If a valid btf entry for the ksym is found,
libbpf can pass in the found btf id to the verifier, which validates the
ksym's type and value.

Typeless ksyms (i.e. those defined as 'void') will not have such btf_id,
but it has the symbol's address (read from kallsyms) and its value is
treated as a raw pointer.
