eeprom: at24: Add support for the Sony VAIO EEPROMs

Special handling of the Sony VAIO EEPROMs is the last feature of the
legacy eeprom driver that the at24 driver does not support. Adding
this would let us deprecate and eventually remove the legacy eeprom
driver.

So add the option to specify a post-processing callback function that
is called after reading data from the EEPROM, before it is returned
to the user. The 24c02-vaio type is the first use case of that option:
the callback function will mask the sensitive data for non-root users
exactly as the legacy eeprom driver was doing.
