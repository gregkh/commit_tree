ARM: s3c: remove cpufreq header dependencies

The cpufreq drivers are split between the machine directory
and the drivers/cpufreq directory. In order to share header
files after we convert s3c to multiplatform, those headers
have to live in a different global location.

Move them to linux/soc/samsung/ in lack of a better place.
