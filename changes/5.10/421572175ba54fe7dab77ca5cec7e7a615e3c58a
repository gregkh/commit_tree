octeontx2-af: Support to enable/disable HW timestamping

Four new mbox messages ids and handler are added in order to
enable or disable timestamping procedure on tx and rx side.
Additionally when PTP is enabled, the packet parser must skip
over 8 bytes and start analyzing packet data there. To make NPC
profiles work seemlesly PTR_ADVANCE of IKPU is set so that
parsing can be done as before when all data pointers
are shifted by 8 bytes automatically.
