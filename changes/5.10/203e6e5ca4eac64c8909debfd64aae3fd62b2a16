mm/memory_hotplug: remove a wrapper for alloc_migration_target()

To calculate the correct node to migrate the page for hotplug, we need to
check node id of the page.  Wrapper for alloc_migration_target() exists
for this purpose.

However, Vlastimil informs that all migration source pages come from a
single node.  In this case, we don't need to check the node id for each
page and we don't need to re-set the target nodemask for each page by
using the wrapper.  Set up the migration_target_control once and use it
for all pages.
