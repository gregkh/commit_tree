ip_tunnels: Set tunnel option flag when tunnel metadata is present

Currently, we may set the tunnel option flag when the size of metadata
is zero.  For example, we set TUNNEL_GENEVE_OPT in the receive function
no matter the geneve option is present or not.  As this may result in
issues on the tunnel flags consumers, this patch fixes the issue.
