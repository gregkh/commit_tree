dma-mapping: add a new dma_alloc_pages API

This API is the equivalent of alloc_pages, except that the returned memory
is guaranteed to be DMA addressable by the passed in device.  The
implementation will also be used to provide a more sensible replacement
for DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT flag.

Additionally dma_alloc_noncoherent is switched over to use dma_alloc_pages
as its backend.
