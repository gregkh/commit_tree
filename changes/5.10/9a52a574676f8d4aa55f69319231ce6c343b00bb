scftorture: Make symbol 'scf_torture_rand' static

The sparse tool complains as follows

kernel/scftorture.c:124:1: warning:
 symbol '__pcpu_scope_scf_torture_rand' was not declared. Should it be static?

And this per-CPU variable is not used outside of scftorture.c,
so this commit marks it static.
