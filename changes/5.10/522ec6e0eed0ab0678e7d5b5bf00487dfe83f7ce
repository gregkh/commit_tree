drm/amdkfd: Replace bitmask with event idx in SMI event msg

Event bitmask is a 64-bit mask with only 1 bit set. Sending this
event bitmask in KFD SMI event message is both wasteful of memory
and potentially limiting to only 64 events. Instead send event
index in SMI event message.
Please note this change does not break the ABI for the two event
types defined so far. The new index is identical to the mask used
before.
