dmaengine: axi-dmac: wrap channel parameter adjust into function

The channel parameters (which are read from the device-tree) are adjusted
for the DMAEngine framework in the axi_dmac_parse_chan_dt() function, after
they are read from the device-tree.

When we want to read these from registers, we will need to use the same
logic, so this change splits the logic into a separate function.
