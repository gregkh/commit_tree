RDMA/core: Added missing WR and WC opcodes

Add work completion opcodes to a new ib_uverbs_wc_opcode enum in
ib_user_verbs.h. This plays the same role as ib_uverbs_wr_opcode
documenting the opcodes in the user space API.

Assigned the IB_WC_XXX opcodes in ib_verbs.h to the IB_UVERBS_WC_XXX
where they are defined. This follows the same pattern as the IB_WR_XXX
opcodes. This fixes an incorrect value for LSO that had crept in but
is not currently being used.

Added a missing IB_WR_BIND_MW opcode in ib_verbs.h.
