irqdomain/msi: Allow to override msi_domain_alloc/free_irqs()

To support MSI irq domains which do not fit at all into the regular MSI
irqdomain scheme, like the XEN MSI interrupt management for PV/HVM/DOM0,
it's necessary to allow to override the alloc/free implementation.

This is a preperatory step to switch X86 away from arch_*_msi_irqs() and
store the irq domain pointer right in struct device.

No functional change for existing MSI irq domain users.

Aside of the evil XEN wrapper this is also useful for special MSI domains
which need to do extra alloc/free work before/after calling the generic
core function. Work like allocating/freeing MSI descriptors, MSI storage
space etc.
