RISC-V: Use non-PGD mappings for early DTB access

Currently, we use PGD mappings for early DTB mapping in early_pgd
but this breaks Linux kernel on SiFive Unleashed because on SiFive
Unleashed PMP checks don't work correctly for PGD mappings.

To fix early DTB mappings on SiFive Unleashed, we use non-PGD
mappings (i.e. PMD) for early DTB access.
