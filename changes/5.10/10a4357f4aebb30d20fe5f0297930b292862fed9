power: supply: charger-manager: fix incorrect check on charging_duration_ms

Currently the duration check on the discharging duration setting is
checking the charging duration rather than the discharging duration
due to a cut-n-paste coding error. Fix this by checking the value
desc->charging_max_duration_ms.
