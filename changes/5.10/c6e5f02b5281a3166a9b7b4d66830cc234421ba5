PCI/ASPM: Remove struct aspm_register_info.support

Previously we stored the "ASPM Support" field from the Link Capabilities
register in the struct aspm_register_info.

Read the Link Capabilities directly when needed and remove it from the
struct aspm_register_info.  No functional change intended.

[bhelgaas: remove pci_dev cached copy since LNKCAP isn't truly read-only,
add PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_ASPM_L0S & PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_ASPM_L1, check them directly
instead of adding aspm_support()]
