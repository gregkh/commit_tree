mm/hugetlb: count file_region to be added when regions_needed != NULL

There are only two cases of function add_reservation_in_range()

    * count file_region and return the number in regions_needed
    * do the real list operation without counting

This means it is not necessary to have two parameters to classify these
two cases.

Just use regions_needed to separate them.
