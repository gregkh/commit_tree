scsi: ufs-mediatek: Support performance mode for inline encryption engine

Some MediaTek UFS platforms support high-performance mode that inline
encryption engine can be boosted while UFS is not clock-gated.

The high-performance mode will be enabled if all below conditions are
well-declaired in device tree,

 - Proper platform-specific compatible string which enables the host
   capability "UFS_MTK_CAP_BOOST_CRYPT_ENGINE".

 - "dvfsrc-vcore" node is available in this platform.

 - Required minimum vcore voltage for high-performance mode.

 - Clock mux and clock parents of inline encryption engine for both
   "low-power mode" and "high-performance mode".
