kvm: x86/mmu: Allocate and free TDP MMU roots

The TDP MMU must be able to allocate paging structure root pages and track
the usage of those pages. Implement a similar, but separate system for root
page allocation to that of the x86 shadow paging implementation. When
future patches add synchronization model changes to allow for parallel
page faults, these pages will need to be handled differently from the
x86 shadow paging based MMU's root pages.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.
