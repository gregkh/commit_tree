dmaengine: Mark dma_request_slave_channel() deprecated

New drivers should use dma_request_chan() instead
dma_request_slave_channel()

dma_request_slave_channel() is a simple wrapper for dma_request_chan()
eating up the error code for channel request failure and makes deferred
probing impossible.

Move the dma_request_slave_channel() into the header as inline function,
mark it as deprecated.
