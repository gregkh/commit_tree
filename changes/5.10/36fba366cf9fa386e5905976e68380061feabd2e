drm/imx: tve remove extraneous type qualifier

clang warns about functions returning a 'const int' result:

drivers/gpu/drm/imx/imx-tve.c:487:8: warning: type qualifiers ignored on function return type [-Wignored-qualifiers]

Remove the extraneous 'const' qualifier here. I would guess that the
function was intended to be marked __attribute__((const)) instead,
but that would also be wrong since it call other functions without
that attribute.
