x86/fpu: Allow multiple bits in clearcpuid= parameter

Commit

  0c2a3913d6f5 ("x86/fpu: Parse clearcpuid= as early XSAVE argument")

changed clearcpuid parsing from __setup() to cmdline_find_option().
While the __setup() function would have been called for each clearcpuid=
parameter on the command line, cmdline_find_option() will only return
the last one, so the change effectively made it impossible to disable
more than one bit.

Allow a comma-separated list of bit numbers as the argument for
clearcpuid to allow multiple bits to be disabled again. Log the bits
being disabled for informational purposes.

Also fix the check on the return value of cmdline_find_option(). It
returns -1 when the option is not found, so testing as a boolean is
incorrect.
