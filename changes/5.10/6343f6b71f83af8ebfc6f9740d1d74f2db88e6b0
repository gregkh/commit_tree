get_maintainer: exclude MAINTAINERS file(s) from --git-fallback

MAINTAINERS files generally have no specific maintainer but are updated by
individuals for subsystems all over the source tree.

Exclude MAINTAINERS file(s) from --git-fallback searches so the unlucky
individuals that update the files the most are not shown by default.
