ASoC: sun8i-codec: Remove extraneous widgets

This driver is for the digital part of the codec only. The analog part,
including the microphone inputs, is managed by a separate driver. These
widgets look like they were copied from sun4i-codec. Since they do not
perform any function in this driver, remove them.
