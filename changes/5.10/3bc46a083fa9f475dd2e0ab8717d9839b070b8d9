drm/sun4i: lvds: Invert the LVDS polarity

The LVDS controller can invert the polarity / lanes of the LVDS output.
The default polarity causes some issues on some panels.

However, U-Boot has always used the opposite polarity without any reported
issue, and the only currently supported LVDS panel in-tree (the TBS A711)
seems to be able to work with both settings.

Let's just use the same polarity than U-Boot to be more consistent and
hopefully support all the panels.
