btrfs: remove struct extent_io_ops

It's no longer used just remove the function and any related code which
was initialising it for inodes. No functional changes.

Removing 8 bytes from extent_io_tree in turn reduces size of other
structures where it is embedded, notably btrfs_inode where it reduces
size by 24 bytes.
