soundwire: sysfs: add slave status and device number before probe

The MIPI DisCo device properties that are read by the driver from
platform firmware, or hard-coded in the driver, should only be
provided as sysfs entries when a driver probes successfully.

However the device status and device number is updated even when there
is no driver present, and hence can be updated when a Slave device is
detected on the bus without being described in platform firmware and
without any driver registered/probed.

As suggested by GregKH, the attribute group for Slave status and
device number is is added by default upon device registration.

Credits to Vinod Koul for the status_show() function, shared in a
separate patch and used as is here. The status table was modified to
remove an unnecessary enum and status_show() is handled in a different
group attribute than what was suggested by Vinod.
