PCI/MSI: Provide pci_dev_has_special_msi_domain() helper

Provide a helper function to check whether a PCI device is handled by a
non-standard PCI/MSI domain. This will be used to exclude such devices
which hang of a special bus, e.g. VMD, to be excluded from the irq domain
override in irq remapping.
