docs: networking: update XPS to account for netif_set_xps_queue

With the introduction of netif_set_xps_queue, XPS can be enabled
by the driver at initialization.

Update the documentation to reflect this, as otherwise users
may incorrectly believe that the feature is off by default.

Fixes: 537c00de1c9b ("net: Add functions netif_reset_xps_queue and netif_set_xps_queue")
