iio: cros_ec: unify hw fifo attributes into the core file

The intent here is to minimize the use of iio_buffer_set_attrs(). Since we
are planning to add support for multiple IIO buffers per IIO device, the
issue has to do with:
1. Accessing 'indio_dev->buffer' directly (as is done with
   'iio_buffer_set_attrs(indio_dev->buffer, <attrs>)').
2. The way that the buffer attributes would get handled or expanded when
   there are more buffers per IIO device. Current a sysfs kobj_type expands
   into a 'device' object that expands into an 'iio_dev' object.
   We will need to change this, so that the sysfs attributes for IIO
   buffers expand into IIO buffers at some point.

Right now, the current IIO framework works fine for the
'1 IIO device == 1 IIO buffer' case (that is now).
