ACPI: OSL: Make ACPICA use logical addresses of GPE blocks

Define ACPI_GPE_USE_LOGICAL_ADDRESSES in aclinux.h and modify
acpi_os_initialize() to store the logical addresses of the FADT GPE
blocks 0 and 1 in acpi_gbl_xgpe0_block_logical_address and
acpi_gbl_xgpe1_block_logical_address, respectively, so as to allow
ACPICA to use them for accessing GPE registers in system memory,
instead of using their physical addresses and looking up the
corresponding logical addresses on every access attempt, which is
inefficient.
