kvm: x86/mmu: Support MMIO in the TDP MMU

In order to support MMIO, KVM must be able to walk the TDP paging
structures to find mappings for a given GFN. Support this walk for
the TDP MMU.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.

v2: Thanks to Dan Carpenter and kernel test robot for finding that root
was used uninitialized in get_mmio_spte.
