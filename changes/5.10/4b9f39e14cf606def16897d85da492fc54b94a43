ASoC: sun50i-codec-analog: Enable DAPM for headphone switch

By including the headphone mute switch to the DAPM graph, both the
headphone amplifier and the Mixer/DAC inputs can be powered off when
the headphones are muted.

The mute switch is between the source selection and the amplifier,
as per the diagram in the SoC manual.
