MIPS: Add support for ZSTD-compressed kernels

Add support for self-extracting kernels with a ZSTD compression.

Tested on a kernel for the GCW-Zero, it allows to reduce the size of the
kernel file from 4.1 MiB with gzip to 3.5 MiB with ZSTD, and boots just
as fast.

Compressed kernels are now also compiled with -D__DISABLE_EXPORTS in
order to disable the EXPORT_SYMBOL() macros inside of
lib/zstd/decompress.c.
