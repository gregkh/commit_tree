btrfs: rename btrfs_insert_clone_extent() to a more generic name

Now that we use the same mechanism to replace all the extents in a file
range with either a hole, an existing extent (when cloning) or a new
extent (when using fallocate), the name of btrfs_insert_clone_extent()
no longer reflects its genericity.

So rename it to btrfs_insert_replace_extent(), since what it does is
to either insert an existing extent or a new extent into a file range.
