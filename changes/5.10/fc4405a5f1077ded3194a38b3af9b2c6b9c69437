media: vidtv: cleanup PSI version numbers

There's no reason to use static vars to store PSI version
numbers.

Also, currently, version numbers are starting with 0x01,
because there's a code being called that increases it to
1 for all table initializer code, as the code may support
dynamic changes at the PS tables on some future.

So, let's just initialize them to 0x1f, in order for the
versions to be reported as starting from 0.
