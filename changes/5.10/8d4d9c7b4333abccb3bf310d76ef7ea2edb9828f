sched/debug: Fix memory corruption caused by multiple small reads of flags

Reading /proc/sys/kernel/sched_domain/cpu*/domain0/flags mutliple times
with small reads causes oopses with slub corruption issues because the kfree is
free'ing an offset from a previous allocation. Fix this by adding in a new
pointer 'buf' for the allocation and kfree and use the temporary pointer tmp
to handle memory copies of the buf offsets.
