PCI: brcmstb: Add bcm7278 PERST# support

The PERST# bit was moved to a different register in 7278-type STB chips.
In addition, the polarity of the bit was also changed; for other chips
writing a 1 specified assert; for 7278-type chips, writing a 0 specifies
assert.  Of course, PERST# is a PCIe asserted-low signal.

While we are here, also change the bridge_sw_init_set() functions so like
the perst_set() functions they are chip specific and we no longer rely on
data wrt chip specific field mask and shift values.
