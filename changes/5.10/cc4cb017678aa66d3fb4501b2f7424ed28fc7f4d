KVM: x86: use positive error values for msr emulation that causes #GP

Recent introduction of the userspace msr filtering added code that uses
negative error codes for cases that result in either #GP delivery to
the guest, or handled by the userspace msr filtering.

This breaks an assumption that a negative error code returned from the
msr emulation code is a semi-fatal error which should be returned
to userspace via KVM_RUN ioctl and usually kill the guest.

Fix this by reusing the already existing KVM_MSR_RET_INVALID error code,
and by adding a new KVM_MSR_RET_FILTERED error code for the
userspace filtered msrs.
