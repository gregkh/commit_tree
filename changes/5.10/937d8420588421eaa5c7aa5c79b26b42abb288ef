cxgb4: set up filter action after rewrites

The current code sets up the filter action field before
rewrites are set up. When the action 'switch' is used
with rewrites, this may result in initial few packets
that get switched out don't have rewrites applied
on them.

So, make sure filter action is set up along with rewrites
or only after everything else is set up for rewrites.
