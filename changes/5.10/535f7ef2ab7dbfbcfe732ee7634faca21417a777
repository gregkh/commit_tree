KVM: VMX: Move IRQ invocation to assembly subroutine

Move the asm blob that invokes the appropriate IRQ handler after VM-Exit
into a proper subroutine.  Unconditionally create a stack frame in the
subroutine so that, as objtool sees things, the function has standard
stack behavior.  The dynamic stack adjustment makes using unwind hints
problematic.
