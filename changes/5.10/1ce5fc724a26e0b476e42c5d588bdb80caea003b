net/mlx5: Clear bw_share upon VF disable

Currently, if user disables VFs with some min and max rates configured,
they are cleared. But QoS data is not cleared and restored upon next VF
enable placing limits on minimal rate for given VF, when user expects
none.

To match cleared vport->info struct with QoS-related min and max rates
upon VF disable, clear vport->qos struct too.
