bpf: Enforce id generation for all may-be-null register type

The commit af7ec1383361 ("bpf: Add bpf_skc_to_tcp6_sock() helper")
introduces RET_PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL and
the commit eaa6bcb71ef6 ("bpf: Introduce bpf_per_cpu_ptr()")
introduces RET_PTR_TO_MEM_OR_BTF_ID_OR_NULL.
Note that for RET_PTR_TO_MEM_OR_BTF_ID_OR_NULL, the reg0->type
could become PTR_TO_MEM_OR_NULL which is not covered by
BPF_PROBE_MEM.

The BPF_REG_0 will then hold a _OR_NULL pointer type. This _OR_NULL
pointer type requires the bpf program to explicitly do a NULL check first.
After NULL check, the verifier will mark all registers having
the same reg->id as safe to use.  However, the reg->id
is not set for those new _OR_NULL return types.  One of the ways
that may be wrong is, checking NULL for one btf_id typed pointer will
end up validating all other btf_id typed pointers because
all of them have id == 0.  The later tests will exercise
this path.

To fix it and also avoid similar issue in the future, this patch
moves the id generation logic out of each individual RET type
test in check_helper_call().  Instead, it does one
reg_type_may_be_null() test and then do the id generation
if needed.

This patch also adds a WARN_ON_ONCE in mark_ptr_or_null_reg()
to catch future breakage.

The _OR_NULL pointer usage in the bpf_iter_reg.ctx_arg_info is
fine because it just happens that the existing id generation after
check_ctx_access() has covered it.  It is also using the
reg_type_may_be_null() to decide if id generation is needed or not.
