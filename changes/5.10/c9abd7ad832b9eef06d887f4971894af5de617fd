io_uring: don't defer put of cancelled ltimeout

Inline io_link_cancel_timeout() and __io_kill_linked_timeout() into
io_kill_linked_timeout(). That allows to easily move a put of a cancelled
linked timeout out of completion_lock and to not deferring it. It is also
much more readable when not scattered across three different functions.
