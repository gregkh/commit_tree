PCI: endpoint: Use "NULL" instead of "0" as a NULL pointer

When returning a NULL pointer, use "NULL" instead of "0".

Fixes sparse warning given by executing "make C=2 drivers/pci/":

  CHECK   drivers/pci/endpoint/pci-epc-core.c
   drivers/pci/endpoint/pci-epc-core.c: note: in included file:
   ./include/linux/pci-ep-cfs.h:22:16: warning:
   Using plain integer as NULL pointer
  CHECK   drivers/pci/endpoint/pci-epf-core.c
   drivers/pci/endpoint/pci-epf-core.c: note: in included file:
   ./include/linux/pci-ep-cfs.h:31:16: warning:
