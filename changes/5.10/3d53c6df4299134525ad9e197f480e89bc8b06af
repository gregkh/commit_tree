ASoC: Intel: catpt: Relax clock selection conditions

Stress tests show that DSP may occasionally be late with signaling WAIT
state when all pins are made use of simultaneously plus start/stop
(pause) gets involved. While this isn't tied to standard audio scenarios
where only System Pin (playback and capture) is involved, ensure user is
not hindered when playing with more advanced scenarios.

>From DSP perspective, clock acts as a resource: low clock equals less
resources, high clock more resources. Relax clock selection procedure so
only low -> high switch is allowed when awaiting WAIT signal times out.
Once active stream count decreases, DSP will have more time internally to
adjust thus low clock selection becomes possible again.
