PCI: iproc: Fix using plain integer as NULL pointer in iproc_pcie_pltfm_probe

Fix sparse build warning:

  drivers/pci/controller/pcie-iproc-platform.c:102:33: warning: Using plain integer as NULL pointer

The map_irq member of the struct iproc_pcie takes a function pointer
serving as a callback to map interrupts, therefore we should pass a NULL
pointer to it rather than a integer in the iproc_pcie_pltfm_probe()
function.

  default functions")
