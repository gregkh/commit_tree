Input: soc_button_array - add Lenovo Yoga Tablet2 1051L to the dmi_use_low_level_irq list

Add the Lenovo Yoga Tablet2 1051L to the list of devices where the
ACPI AML code is poking the GPIO config register directly changing
the IRQ type to a low_level_irq, which we need to work around.

This fixes the home button on the Lenovo Yoga Tablet2 1051L not
working.
