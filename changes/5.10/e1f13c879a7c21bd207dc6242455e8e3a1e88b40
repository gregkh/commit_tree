staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize of usb endpoints found

While finding usb endpoints in vmk80xx_find_usb_endpoints(), check if
wMaxPacketSize = 0 for the endpoints found.

Some devices have isochronous endpoints that have wMaxPacketSize = 0
(as required by the USB-2 spec).
However, since this doesn't apply here, wMaxPacketSize = 0 can be
considered to be invalid.
