io_uring: make loop_rw_iter() use original user supplied pointers

We jump through a hoop for fixed buffers, where we first map these to
a bvec(), then kmap() the bvec to obtain the pointer we copy to/from.
This was always a bit ugly, and with the set_fs changes, it ends up
being practically problematic as well.

There's no need to jump through these hoops, just use the original user
pointers and length for the non iter based read/write.
