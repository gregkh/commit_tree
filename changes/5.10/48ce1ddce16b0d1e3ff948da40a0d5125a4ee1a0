ima: Fail rule parsing when asymmetric key measurement isn't supportable

Measuring keys is currently only supported for asymmetric keys. In the
future, this might change.

For now, the "func=KEY_CHECK" and "keyrings=" options are only
appropriate when CONFIG_IMA_MEASURE_ASYMMETRIC_KEYS is enabled. Make
this clear at policy load so that IMA policy authors don't assume that
these policy language constructs are supported.

Fixes: 2b60c0ecedf8 ("IMA: Read keyrings= option from the IMA policy")
Fixes: 5808611cccb2 ("IMA: Add KEY_CHECK func to measure keys")
