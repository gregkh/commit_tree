i40e: Fix removing driver while bare-metal VFs pass traffic

Prevent VFs from resetting when PF driver is being unloaded:
- introduce new pf state: __I40E_VF_RESETS_DISABLED;
- check if pf state has __I40E_VF_RESETS_DISABLED state set,
  if so, disable any further VFLR event notifications;
- when i40e_remove (rmmod i40e) is called, disable any resets on
  the VFs;

Previously if there were bare-metal VFs passing traffic and PF
driver was removed, there was a possibility of VFs triggering a Tx
timeout right before iavf_remove. This was causing iavf_close to
not be called because there is a check in the beginning of  iavf_remove
that bails out early if adapter->state < IAVF_DOWN_PENDING. This
makes it so some resources do not get cleaned up.
