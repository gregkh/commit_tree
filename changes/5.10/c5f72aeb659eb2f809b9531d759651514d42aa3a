pinctrl: qcom: Set IRQCHIP_SET_TYPE_MASKED and IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND flags

Both IRQCHIP_SET_TYPE_MASKED and IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND flags are already
set for msmgpio's parent PDC irqchip but GPIO interrupts do not get masked
during suspend or during setting irq type since genirq checks irqchip flag
of msmgpio irqchip which forwards these calls to its parent PDC irqchip.

Add irqchip specific flags for msmgpio irqchip to mask non wakeirqs during
suspend and mask before setting irq type. Masking before changing type make
sures any spurious interrupt is not detected during this operation.
