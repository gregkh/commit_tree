Documentation/process: expand plain-text advice

This adds a link to https://useplaintext.email to email-clients.rst,
which is a more exhaustive resource on configuring various mail clients
for plain text use. submitting-patches.rst is also updated to direct
readers to email-clients.rst to equip new contributors with the
requisite knowledge to become a good participant on the mailing lists.
