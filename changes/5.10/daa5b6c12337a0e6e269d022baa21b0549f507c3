kvm: x86/mmu: Don't clear write flooding count for direct roots

Direct roots don't have a write flooding count because the guest can't
affect that paging structure. Thus there's no need to clear the write
flooding count on a fast CR3 switch for direct roots.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.
