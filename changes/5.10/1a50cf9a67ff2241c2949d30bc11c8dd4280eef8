net/mlx5e: Fix incorrect access of RCU-protected xdp_prog

rq->xdp_prog is RCU-protected and should be accessed only with
rcu_access_pointer for the NULL check in mlx5e_poll_rx_cq.

rq->xdp_prog may change on the fly only from one non-NULL value to
another non-NULL value, so the checks in mlx5e_xdp_handle and
mlx5e_poll_rx_cq will have the same result during one NAPI cycle,
meaning that no additional synchronization is needed.
