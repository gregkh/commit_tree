KVM: VMX: Rename "__find_msr_index" to "__vmx_find_uret_msr"

Rename "__find_msr_index" to scope it to VMX, associate it with
guest_uret_msrs, and to avoid conflating "MSR's ECX index" with "MSR's
array index".  Similarly, don't use "slot" in the name so as to avoid
colliding the common x86's half of "user_return_msrs" (the slot in
kvm_user_return_msrs is not the same slot in guest_uret_msrs).

No functional change intended.
