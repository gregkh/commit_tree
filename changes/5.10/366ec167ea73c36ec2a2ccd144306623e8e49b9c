drm/i915: Make i830 .get_cdclk() assignment less confusing

Explicitly check for i830 when assigning the .get_cdclk() vfunc,
and then deal with the case of not having assigned the vfunc
separately. Less confusing, and gets rid of the checkpatch complaint
about using {} on one branch but not the others.
