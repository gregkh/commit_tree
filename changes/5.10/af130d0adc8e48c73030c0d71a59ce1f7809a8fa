KVM: arm64: Add undocumented return values for PMU device control group

KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_IRQ returns -EFAULT if get_user() fails when reading
the interrupt number from kvm_device_attr.addr.

KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_INIT returns the error value from kvm_vgic_set_owner().
kvm_arm_pmu_v3_init() checks that the vgic has been initialized and the
interrupt number is valid, but kvm_vgic_set_owner() can still return the
error code -EEXIST if another device has already claimed the interrupt.
