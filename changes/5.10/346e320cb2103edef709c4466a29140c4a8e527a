netfilter: nftables: allow re-computing sctp CRC-32C in 'payload' statements

nftables payload statements are used to mangle SCTP headers, but they can
only replace the Internet Checksum. As a consequence, nftables rules that
mangle sport/dport/vtag in SCTP headers potentially generate packets that
are discarded by the receiver, unless the CRC-32C is "offloaded" (e.g the
rule mangles a skb having 'ip_summed' equal to 'CHECKSUM_PARTIAL'.

Fix this extending uAPI definitions and L4 checksum update function, in a
way that userspace programs (e.g. nft) can instruct the kernel to compute
CRC-32C in SCTP headers. Also ensure that LIBCRC32C is built if NF_TABLES
is 'y' or 'm' in the kernel build configuration.
