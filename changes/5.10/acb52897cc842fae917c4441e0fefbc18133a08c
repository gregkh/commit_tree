PCI: hip: Add handling of HiSilicon HIP PCIe controller errors

The HiSilicon HIP PCIe controller is capable of handling errors
on root port and performing port reset separately at each root port.

Add error handling driver for HIP PCIe controller to log
and report recoverable errors. Perform root port reset and restore
link status after the recovery.

Following are some of the PCIe controller's recoverable errors
1. completion transmission timeout error.
2. CRS retry counter over the threshold error.
3. ECC 2 bit errors
4. AXI bresponse/rresponse errors etc.

The driver placed in the drivers/pci/controller/ because the
HIP PCIe controller does not use DWC IP.
