kdb: Use newer api for tasklist scanning

This kills using the do_each_thread/while_each_thread combo to
iterate all threads and uses for_each_process_thread() instead,
maintaining semantics. while_each_thread() is ultimately racy
and deprecated;  although in this particular case there is no
concurrency so it doesn't matter. Still lets trivially get rid
of two more users.
