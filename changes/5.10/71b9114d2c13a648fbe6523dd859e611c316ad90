ARM: s3c: move into a common directory

s3c24xx and s3c64xx have a lot in common, but are split across three
separate directories, which makes the interaction of the header files
more complicated than necessary.

Move all three directories into a new mach-s3c, with a minimal
set of changes to each file.

[krzk: Rebase, add s3c24xx and s3c64xx suffix to several files, add SPDX
       headers to new files, remove plat-samsung from MAINTAINERS]
