s390/pci: fix CPU address in MSI for directed IRQ

The directed MSIs are delivered to CPUs whose address is
written to the MSI message address. The current code assumes
that a CPU logical number (as it is seen by the kernel)
is also the CPU address.

The above assumption is not correct, as the CPU address
is rather the value returned by STAP instruction. That
value does not necessarily match the kernel logical CPU
number.
