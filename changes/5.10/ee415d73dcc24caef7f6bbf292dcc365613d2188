tools/testing/scatterlist: Fix test to compile and run

Add missing define of ALIGN_DOWN to make the test build and run.  In
addition, __sg_alloc_table_from_pages now support unaligned maximum
segment, so adapt the test result accordingly.

Fixes: 07da1223ec93 ("lib/scatterlist: Add support in dynamic allocation of SG table from pages")
