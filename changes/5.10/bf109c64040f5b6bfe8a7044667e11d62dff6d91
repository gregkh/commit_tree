fuse: implement crossmounts

FUSE servers can indicate crossmount points by setting FUSE_ATTR_SUBMOUNT
in fuse_attr.flags.  The inode will then be marked as S_AUTOMOUNT, and the
.d_automount implementation creates a new submount at that location, so
that the submount gets a distinct st_dev value.

Note that all submounts get a distinct superblock and a distinct st_dev
value, so for virtio-fs, even if the same filesystem is mounted more than
once on the host, none of its mount points will have the same st_dev.  We
need distinct superblocks because the superblock points to the root node,
but the different host mounts may show different trees (e.g. due to
submounts in some of them, but not in others).

Right now, this behavior is only enabled when fuse_conn.auto_submounts is
set, which is the case only for virtio-fs.
