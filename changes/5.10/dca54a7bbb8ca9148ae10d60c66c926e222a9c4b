afs: Add tracing for cell refcount and active user count

Add a tracepoint to log the cell refcount and active user count and pass in
a reason code through various functions that manipulate these counters.

Additionally, a helper function, afs_see_cell(), is provided to log
interesting places that deal with a cell without actually doing any
accounting directly.
