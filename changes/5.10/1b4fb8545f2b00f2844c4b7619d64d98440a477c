x86/fpu: Move xgetbv()/xsetbv() into a separate header

The xgetbv() function is needed in the pre-decompression boot code,
but asm/fpu/internal.h can't be included there directly. Doing so
opens the door to include-hell due to various include-magic in
boot/compressed/misc.h.

Avoid that by moving xgetbv()/xsetbv() to a separate header file and
include it instead.
