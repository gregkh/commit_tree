x86/mce/dev-mcelog: Do not update kflags on AMD systems

The mcelog utility is not commonly used on AMD systems. Therefore,
errors logged only by the dev_mce_log() notifier will be missed. This
may occur if the EDAC modules are not loaded, in which case it's
preferable to print the error record by the default notifier.

However, the mce->kflags set by dev_mce_log() notifier makes the
default notifier skip over the errors assuming they are processed by
dev_mce_log().

Do not update kflags in the dev_mce_log() notifier on AMD systems.
