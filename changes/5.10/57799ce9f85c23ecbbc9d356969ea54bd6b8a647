habanalabs: add indication of security-enabled F/W

Future F/W versions will have enhanced security measures and the driver
won't be able to do certain configurations that it always did and those
configurations will be done by the firmware.

We use the firmware's preboot version to determine whether security
measures are enabled or not. Because we need this very early in our code,
the read of the preboot version is moved to the earliest possible place,
right after the device's PCI initialization.
