efivarfs: Replace invalid slashes with exclamation marks in dentries.

Without this patch efivarfs_alloc_dentry creates dentries with slashes in
their name if the respective EFI variable has slashes in its name. This in
turn causes EIO on getdents64, which prevents a complete directory listing
of /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/.

This patch replaces the invalid shlashes with exclamation marks like
kobject_set_name_vargs does for /sys/firmware/efi/vars/ to have consistently
named dentries under /sys/firmware/efi/vars/ and /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/.
