drm/vc4: hdmi: Make sure our clock rate is within limits

The HDMI controller cannot go above a certain pixel rate limit depending on
the generations, but that limit is only enforced in mode_valid at the
moment, which means that we won't advertise modes that exceed that limit,
but the userspace is still free to try to setup a mode that would.

Implement atomic_check to make sure we check it in that scenario too.
