net: stmmac: fix incorrect merge of patch upstream

Commit 757926247836 ("net: stmmac: add flexible PPS to dwmac
4.10a") was intended to modify the struct dwmac410_ops, but it got
somehow badly merged and modified the struct dwmac4_ops.

Revert the modification in struct dwmac4_ops and re-apply it
properly in struct dwmac410_ops.
