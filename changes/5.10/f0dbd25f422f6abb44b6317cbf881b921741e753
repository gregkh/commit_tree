usb/host: ehci-npcm7xx: Use pm_ptr() macro

Use the newly introduced pm_ptr() macro, and mark the suspend/resume
functions __maybe_unused. These functions can then be moved outside the
CONFIG_PM_SUSPEND block, and the compiler can then process them and
detect build failures independently of the config. If unused, they will
simply be discarded by the compiler.
