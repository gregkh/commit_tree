vrf: packets with lladdr src needs dst at input with orig_iif when needs strict

Depending on the order of the routes to fe80::/64 are installed on the
VRF table, the NS for the source link-local address of the originator
might be sent to the wrong interface.

This patch ensures that packets with link-local addr source is doing a
lookup with the orig_iif when the destination addr indicates that it
is strict.

Add the reproducer as a use case in self test script fcnal-test.sh.
