tools/bpftool: Fix PID fetching with a lot of results

In case of having so many PID results that they don't fit into a singe page
(4096) bytes, bpftool will erroneously conclude that it got corrupted data due
to 4096 not being a multiple of struct pid_iter_entry, so the last entry will
be partially truncated. Fix this by sizing the buffer to fit exactly N entries
with no truncation in the middle of record.
