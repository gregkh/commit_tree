ALSA: timer: Replace tasklet with work

The tasklet is an old API that should be deprecated, usually can be
converted to another decent API.  In ALSA core timer API, the
callbacks can be offlined to a tasklet when a flag is set in the timer
backend.  It can be achieved gracefully with a work queued in the
high-prio system workqueue.

This patch replaces the usage of tasklet in ALSA timer API with a
simple work.  Currently the tasklet feature is used only in the system
timer and hrtimer backends, so both are patched to use the new flag
name SNDRV_TIMER_HW_WORK, too.
