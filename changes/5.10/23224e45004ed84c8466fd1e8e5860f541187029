mm: remove kzfree() compatibility definition

Commit 453431a54934 ("mm, treewide: rename kzfree() to
kfree_sensitive()") renamed kzfree() to kfree_sensitive(),
but it left a compatibility definition of kzfree() to avoid
being too disruptive.

Since then a few more instances of kzfree() have slipped in.

Just get rid of them and remove the compatibility definition
once and for all.
