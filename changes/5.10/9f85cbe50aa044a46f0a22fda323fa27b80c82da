RDMA/uverbs: Expose the new GID query API to user space

Expose the query GID table and entry API to user space by adding two new
methods and method handlers to the device object.

This API provides a faster way to query a GID table using single call and
will be used in libibverbs to improve current approach that requires
multiple calls to open, close and read multiple sysfs files for a single
GID table entry.
