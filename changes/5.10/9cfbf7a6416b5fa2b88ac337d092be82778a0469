serial: core: don't use snprintf() for formatting sysfs attrs

As per the documentation (Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.rst),
snprintf() should not be used for formatting values returned by sysfs.

For all of the instances in serial_core.c, we know that the string will
be <PAGE_SIZE in length, so just use sprintf().
