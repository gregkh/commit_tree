fs: dlm: disallow buffer size below default

I observed that the upper layer will not send messages above this value.
As conclusion the application receive buffer should not below that
value, otherwise we are not capable to deliver the dlm message to the
upper layer. This patch forbids to set the receive buffer below the
maximum possible dlm message size.
