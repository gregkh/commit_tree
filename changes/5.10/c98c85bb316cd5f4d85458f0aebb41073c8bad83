drm/vc4: hdmi: rework connectors and encoders

the vc4_hdmi driver has some custom structures to hold the data it needs to
associate with the drm_encoder and drm_connector structures.

However, it allocates them separately from the vc4_hdmi structure which
makes it more complicated than it needs to be.

Move those structures to be contained by vc4_hdmi and update the code
accordingly.
