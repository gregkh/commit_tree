media: atomisp: fix some bad indents

As smatch reports, there are several bad indents:

    drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/hmm/hmm.c:271 hmm_alloc() warn: inconsistent indenting
    drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/runtime/bufq/src/bufq.c:390 ia_css_bufq_enqueue_psys_event() warn: inconsistent indenting
    drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/runtime/debug/src/ia_css_debug.c:2132 ia_css_debug_dump_isys_state() warn: inconsistent indenting
    drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/runtime/binary/src/binary.c:246 sh_css_binary_get_sc_requirements() warn: inconsistent indenting
    drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/runtime/binary/src/binary.c:565 ia_css_binary_get_shading_info_type_1() warn: inconsistent indenting
    drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/sh_css.c:5109 sh_css_pipes_stop() warn: inconsistent indenting
    drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/sh_css.c:8791 ia_css_pipe_create() warn: inconsistent indenting

Some of them are due to ifdefs. Get rid of them by either getting
a common code that would work for both ISP2400 and ISP2401 or
by creating separate functions, one for each ISP version.
