bpf: Set meta->raw_mode for pointers close to use

If we encounter a pointer to memory, we set meta->raw_mode depending
on the type of memory we point at. What isn't obvious is that this
information is only used when the next memory size argument is
encountered.

Move the assignment closer to where it's used, and add a comment that
explains what is going on.
