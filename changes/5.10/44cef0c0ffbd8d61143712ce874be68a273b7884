can: c_can: c_can_power_up(): fix error handling

In the error handling in c_can_power_up(), there are two bugs:

1) c_can_pm_runtime_get_sync() will increase usage counter if device is not
   empty. Forgetting to call c_can_pm_runtime_put_sync() will result in a
   reference leak here.

2) c_can_reset_ram() operation will set start bit when enable is true. We
   should clear it in the error handling.

We fix it by adding c_can_pm_runtime_put_sync() for 1), and
c_can_reset_ram(enable is false) for 2) in the error handling.
