arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Add more labels

Add a few more labels to device nodes declared in msm8916.dtsi
so that we can set all needed properties using labels in the
board-specific device tree part.

Also rename the "otg" label to "usb" to allow grouping it with
the USB PHY (usb_hs_phy) node when ordering referenced labels
alphabetically.
