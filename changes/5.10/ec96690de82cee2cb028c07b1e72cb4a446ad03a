ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Enable fast charge

At power-up the analog circuits may take up to one full second before
being charged with the default configuration. Using the analog blocks
before they are ready generates a *very* crappy sound.

Enable the fast charge feature, which will require a bit more power
than normal charge but will definitely speed up the starting operation
by shrinking this delay to up to 40 ms.
