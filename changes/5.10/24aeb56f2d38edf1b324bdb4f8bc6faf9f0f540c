gve: Add Gvnic stats AQ command and ethtool show/set-priv-flags.

This adds functionality to report driver stats to Hypervisor.
(Users may want to turn this feature off as a matter of privacy
so a "report-stats" flag is added as an ethtool priv option.
It is also disabled by default.)
The hypervisor would trigger a stats report in case "too many"
packets dropped; the stats would be useful in debugging stuck
queues.
A "stats_report_trigger_cnt" stat is added to count the number of times
the hypervisor attempts to trigger stats report.

A timer is also added so that when report-stats is enabled, stat are
updated once every 20 seconds.
