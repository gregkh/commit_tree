i40e: Fix MAC address setting for a VF via Host/VM

Fix MAC setting flow for the PF driver.

Update the unicast VF's MAC address in VF structure if it is
a new setting in i40e_vc_add_mac_addr_msg.

When unicast MAC address gets deleted, record that and
set the new unicast MAC address that is already waiting in the filter
list. This logic is based on the order of messages arriving to
the PF driver.

Without this change the MAC address setting was interpreted
incorrectly in the following use cases:
1) Print incorrect VF MAC or zero MAC
ip link show dev $pf
2) Don't preserve MAC between driver reload
rmmod iavf; modprobe iavf
3) Update VF MAC when macvlan was set
ip link add link $vf address $mac $vf.1 type macvlan
4) Failed to update mac address when VF was trusted
ip link set dev $vf address $mac

This includes all other configurations including above commands.
