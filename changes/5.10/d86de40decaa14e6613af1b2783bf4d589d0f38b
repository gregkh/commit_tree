arm64: cpufeature: upgrade hyp caps to final

We finalize caps before initializing kvm hyp code, and any use of
cpus_have_const_cap() in kvm hyp code generates redundant and
potentially unsound code to read the cpu_hwcaps array.

A number of helper functions used in both hyp context and regular kernel
context use cpus_have_const_cap(), as some regular kernel code runs
before the capabilities are finalized. It's tedious and error-prone to
write separate copies of these for hyp and non-hyp code.

So that we can avoid the redundant code, let's automatically upgrade
cpus_have_const_cap() to cpus_have_final_cap() when used in hyp context.
With this change, there's never a reason to access to cpu_hwcaps array
from hyp code, and we don't need to create an NVHE alias for this.

This should have no effect on non-hyp code.
