locktorture: Make function torture_percpu_rwsem_init() static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

kernel/locking/locktorture.c:569:6: warning:
 symbol 'torture_percpu_rwsem_init' was not declared. Should it be static?

And this function is not used outside of locktorture.c,
so this commit marks it static.
