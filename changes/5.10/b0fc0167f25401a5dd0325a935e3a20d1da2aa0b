bus: mhi: core: Allow shared IRQ for event rings

There is no requirement for using a dedicated IRQ per event ring.
Some systems does not support multiple MSI vectors (e.g. intel
without CONFIG_IRQ_REMAP), In that case the MHI controller can
configure all the event rings to use the same interrupt (as fallback).

Allow this by removing the nr_irqs = ev_ring test and add extra check
in the irq_setup function.
