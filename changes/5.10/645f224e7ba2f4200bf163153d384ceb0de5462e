kprobes: Tell lockdep about kprobe nesting

Since the kprobe handlers have protection that prohibits other handlers from
executing in other contexts (like if an NMI comes in while processing a
kprobe, and executes the same kprobe, it will get fail with a "busy"
return). Lockdep is unaware of this protection. Use lockdep's nesting api to
differentiate between locks taken in INT3 context and other context to
suppress the false warnings.
