soundwire: intel: fix race condition on system resume

Previous patches took care of the case where the master device is
pm_runtime 'suspended' when a system suspend occurs.

In the case where the master device was not suspended, e.g. if suspend
occurred while streaming audio, Intel validation noticed a race
condition: the pm_runtime suspend may conflict with the enumeration
started by the system resume.

This can be simply fixed by updating the status before exiting system
resume.
