io_uring: move io identity items into separate struct

io-wq contains a pointer to the identity, which we just hold in io_kiocb
for now. This is in preparation for putting this outside io_kiocb. The
only exception is struct files_struct, which we'll need different rules
for to avoid a circular dependency.

No functional changes in this patch.
