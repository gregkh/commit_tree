iwlwifi: mvm: ignore the scan duration parameter

The scan request may specify the request scan dwell time.
However, this value may not always be optimal (e.g. short dwell
time for a passive channel). This may happen in a scan request
as a result of beacon report request, in which the AP may request
an active scan, thus setting a short dwell time, but the station
will perform a passive scan due to regulatory.

Ignore the scan duration parameter and always use the internal
scan dwell time which should be optimal.
