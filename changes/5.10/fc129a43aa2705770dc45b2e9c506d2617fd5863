spi: spi-geni-qcom: Use the FIFO even more

In commit 902481a78ee4 ("spi: spi-geni-qcom: Actually use our FIFO") I
explained that the maximum size we could program the FIFO was
"mas->tx_fifo_depth - 3" but that I chose "mas->tx_fifo_depth()"
because I was worried about decreased bandwidth.

Since that time:
* All the interconnect patches have landed, making things run at the
  proper speed.
* I've done more measurements.

This lets me confirm that there's really no downside of using the FIFO
more.  Specifically I did "flashrom -p ec -r /tmp/foo.bin" on a
Chromebook and averaged over several runs.

Before: It took 6.66 seconds and 59669 interrupts fired.
After:  It took 6.66 seconds and 47992 interrupts fired.
