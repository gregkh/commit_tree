gfs2: Wake up when sd_glock_disposal becomes zero

Commit fc0e38dae645 ("GFS2: Fix glock deallocation race") fixed a
sd_glock_disposal accounting bug by adding a missing atomic_dec
statement, but it failed to wake up sd_glock_wait when that decrement
causes sd_glock_disposal to reach zero.  As a consequence,
gfs2_gl_hash_clear can now run into a 10-minute timeout instead of
being woken up.  Add the missing wakeup.
