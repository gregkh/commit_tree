ext4: factor out ext4_xattr_credits_for_new_inode()

To compute a new inode's xattr credits, we need to know whether the
inode will be encrypted or not.  When we switch to use the new helper
function fscrypt_prepare_new_inode(), we won't find out whether the
inode will be encrypted until slightly later than is currently the case.
That will require moving the code block that computes the xattr credits.

To make this easier and reduce the length of __ext4_new_inode(), move
this code block into a new function ext4_xattr_credits_for_new_inode().
