i2c: tegra: Initialize div-clk rate unconditionally

It doesn't make sense to conditionalize the div-clk rate changes because
rate is fixed and it won't ever change once it's set at the driver's probe
time. All further changes are NO-OPs because CCF caches rate and skips
rate-change if rate is unchanged.
