clk: keystone: sci-clk: add 10% slack to set_rate

Currently, we request exact clock rates from the firmware to be set with
set_rate. Due to some rounding errors and internal functionality of the
firmware itself, this can fail. Thus, add some slack to the set_rate
functionality so that we are always guaranteed to pass. The firmware
always attempts to use frequency as close to the target freq as
possible despite the slack given here.
