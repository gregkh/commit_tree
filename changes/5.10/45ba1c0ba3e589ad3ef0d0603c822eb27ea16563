media: pulse8-cec: add support for FW v10 and up

Starting with firmware version 10 the GET/SET_HDMI_VERSION message
was removed and GET/SET_AUTO_POWER_ON was added.

The removal of GET/SET_HDMI_VERSION caused the probe of the
Pulse-Eight to fail. Add a version check to handle this gracefully.

Also show (but do not set) the Auto Power On value.
