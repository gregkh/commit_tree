PCI: layerscape: Modify the MSIX to the doorbell mode

dw_pcie_ep_raise_msix_irq was never called in the exisitng driver
before, because the ls1046a platform don't support the MSIX feature
and msix_capable was always set to false.
Now that add the ls1088a platform with MSIX support, use the doorbell
method to support the MSIX feature.
