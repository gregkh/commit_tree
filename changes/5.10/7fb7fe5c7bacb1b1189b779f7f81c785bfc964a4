s390/qeth: cancel cmds earlier during teardown

Originators of cmd IO typically hold the rtnl or conf_mutex to protect
against a concurrent teardown.
Since qeth_set_offline() already holds the conf_mutex, the main reason
why we still care about cancelling pending cmds is so that they release
the rtnl when we need it ourselves.

So move this step a little earlier into the teardown sequence.
