x86/mce: Add Skylake quirk for patrol scrub reported errors

The patrol scrubber in Skylake and Cascade Lake systems can be configured
to report uncorrected errors using a special signature in the machine
check bank and to signal using CMCI instead of machine check.

Update the severity calculation mechanism to allow specifying the model,
minimum stepping and range of machine check bank numbers.

Add a new rule to detect the special signature (on model 0x55, stepping
>=4 in any of the memory controller banks).

 [ bp: Rewrite it.
   aegl: Productize it. ]
