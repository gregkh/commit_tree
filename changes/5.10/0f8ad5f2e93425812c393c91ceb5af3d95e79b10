kcsan: Add support for atomic builtins

Some architectures (currently e.g. s390 partially) implement atomics
using the compiler's atomic builtins (__atomic_*, __sync_*). To support
enabling KCSAN on such architectures in future, or support experimental
use of these builtins, implement support for them.

We should also avoid breaking KCSAN kernels due to use (accidental or
otherwise) of atomic builtins in drivers, as has happened in the past:

The instrumentation is subtly different from regular reads/writes: TSAN
instrumentation replaces the use of atomic builtins with a call into the
runtime, and the runtime's job is to also execute the desired atomic
operation. We rely on the __atomic_* compiler builtins, available with
all KCSAN-supported compilers, to implement each TSAN atomic
instrumentation function.
