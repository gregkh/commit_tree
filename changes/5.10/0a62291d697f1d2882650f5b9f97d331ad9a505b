libbpf: Compile libbpf under -O2 level by default and catch extra warnings

For some reason compiler doesn't complain about uninitialized variable, fixed
in previous patch, if libbpf is compiled without -O2 optimization level. So do
compile it with -O2 and never let similar issue slip by again. -Wall is added
unconditionally, so no need to specify it again.
