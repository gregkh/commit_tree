w1: mxc_w1: Fix timeout resolution problem leading to bus error

On my platform (i.MX53) bus access sometimes fails with
	w1_search: max_slave_count 64 reached, will continue next search.

The reason is the use of jiffies to implement a 200us timeout in
mxc_w1_ds2_touch_bit().
On some platforms the jiffies timer resolution is insufficient for this.

Fix by replacing jiffies by ktime_get().

For consistency apply the same change to the other use of jiffies in
mxc_w1_ds2_reset_bus().
