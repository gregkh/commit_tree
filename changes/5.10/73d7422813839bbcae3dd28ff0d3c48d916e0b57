macb: prepare at91 to use a 2-frame TX queue

The RM9200 supports one frame being sent while another one is waiting in
queue. This avoids the dead time that follows the emission of a frame
and which prevents one from reaching line speed.

Right now the driver supports only a single skb, so we'll first replace
the rm9200-specific skb info with an array of two macb_tx_skb (already
used by other drivers). This patch only moves the skb_length to
txq[0].size and skb_physaddr to skb[0].mapping but doesn't perform any
other change. It already uses [desc] in order to minimize future changes.
