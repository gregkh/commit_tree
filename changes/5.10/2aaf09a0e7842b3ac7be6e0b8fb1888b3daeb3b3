r8169: work around short packet hw bug on RTL8125

Network problems with RTL8125B have been reported [0] and with help
from Realtek it turned out that this chip version has a hw problem
with short packets (similar to RTL8168evl). Having said that activate
the same workaround as for RTL8168evl.
Realtek suggested to activate the workaround for RTL8125A too, even
though they're not 100% sure yet which RTL8125 versions are affected.
