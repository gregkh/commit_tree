mmc: sdhci: Add LTR support for some Intel BYT based controllers

Some Intel BYT based host controllers support the setting of latency
tolerance.  Accordingly, implement the PM QoS ->set_latency_tolerance()
callback.  The raw register values are also exposed via debugfs.

Intel EHL controllers require this support.
