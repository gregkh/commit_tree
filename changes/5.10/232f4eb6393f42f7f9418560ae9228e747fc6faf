efi: pstore: disentangle from deprecated efivars module

The EFI pstore implementation relies on the 'efivars' abstraction,
which encapsulates the EFI variable store in a way that can be
overridden by other backing stores, like the Google SMI one.

On top of that, the EFI pstore implementation also relies on the
efivars.ko module, which is a separate layer built on top of the
'efivars' abstraction that exposes the [deprecated] sysfs entries
for each variable that exists in the backing store.

Since the efivars.ko module is deprecated, and all users appear to
have moved to the efivarfs file system instead, let's prepare for
its removal, by removing EFI pstore's dependency on it.
