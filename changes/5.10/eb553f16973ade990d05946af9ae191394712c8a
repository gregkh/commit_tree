powerpc/64/mm: implement page mapping percpu first chunk allocator

Implement page mapping percpu first chunk allocator as a fallback to
the embedding allocator. With 4K hash translation we limit our page
table range to 64TB and commit: 0034d395f89d ("powerpc/mm/hash64: Map all the
kernel regions in the same 0xc range") moved all kernel mapping to
that 64TB range. In-order to support sparse memory layout we need
to increase our linear mapping space and reduce other mappings.

With such a layout percpu embedded first chunk allocator will fail
because of small vmalloc range. Add a fallback to page mapping
percpu first chunk allocator for such failures.

The below dmesg output can be observed in such case.

 percpu: max_distance=0x1ffffef00000 too large for vmalloc space 0x10000000000
 PERCPU: auto allocator failed (-22), falling back to page size
 percpu: 40 4K pages/cpu s148816 r0 d15024
