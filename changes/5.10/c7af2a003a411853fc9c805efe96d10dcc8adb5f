iocost: reimplement debt forgiveness using average usage

Debt forgiveness logic was counting the number of consecutive !busy periods
as the trigger condition. While this usually works, it can easily be thrown
off by temporary fluctuations especially on configurations w/ short periods.

This patch reimplements debt forgiveness so that:

* Use the average usage over the forgiveness period instead of counting
  consecutive periods.

* Debt is reduced at around the target rate (1/2 every 100ms) regardless of
  ioc period duration.

* Usage threshold is raised to 50%. Combined with the preceding changes and
  the switch to average usage, this makes debt forgivness a lot more
  effective at reducing the amount of unnecessary idleness.

* Constants are renamed with DFGV_ prefix.
