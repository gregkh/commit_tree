kgdb: Add NOKPROBE labels on the trap handler functions

Currently kgdb honours the kprobe blocklist but doesn't place its own
trap handling code on the list. Add labels to discourage attempting to
use kgdb to debug itself.

Not every functions that executes from the trap handler needs to be
marked up: relatively early in the trap handler execution (just after
we bring the other CPUs to a halt) all breakpoints are replaced with
the original opcodes. This patch marks up code in the debug_core that
executes between trap entry and the breakpoints being deactivated
and, also, code that executes between breakpoint activation and trap
exit.

To be clear these changes are not sufficient to make recursive trapping
impossible since they do not include library calls made during kgdb's
entry/exit logic. However going much further whilst we are sharing the
kprobe blocklist risks reducing the capabilities of kprobe and this
would be a bad trade off (especially so given kgdb's users are currently
conditioned to avoid recursive traps).
