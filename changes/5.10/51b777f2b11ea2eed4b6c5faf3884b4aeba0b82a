drm: mxsfb: Merge mxsfb_set_pixel_fmt() and mxsfb_set_bus_fmt()

The mxsfb_set_pixel_fmt() and mxsfb_set_bus_fmt() functions both deal
with format configuration, are always called in a row from
mxsfb_crtc_mode_set_nofb(), and set fields from the LCDC_CTRL register.
This requires a read-modify-update cycle in mxsfb_set_bus_fmt(). Make
this more efficient by merging them together.
