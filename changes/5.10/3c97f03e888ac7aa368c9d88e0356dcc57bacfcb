docs: kvm: api.rst: add missing spaces

There are some warnings:

   Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst:4354: WARNING: Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
   Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst:4358: WARNING: Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
   Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst:4363: WARNING: Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

Produced by the lack of identation on a single line. That
caused the literal block to end prematurely.
