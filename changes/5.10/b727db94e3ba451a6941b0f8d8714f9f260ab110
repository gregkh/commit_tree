dt-bindings: mfd: Correct interrupt flags in examples

GPIO_ACTIVE_x flags are not correct in the context of interrupt flags.
These are simple defines so they could be used in DTS but they will not
have the same meaning:
1. GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH = 0 = IRQ_TYPE_NONE
2. GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW  = 1 = IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING

Correct the interrupt flags, assuming the author of the code wanted same
logical behavior behind the name "ACTIVE_xxx", this is:
  ACTIVE_LOW => IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW
