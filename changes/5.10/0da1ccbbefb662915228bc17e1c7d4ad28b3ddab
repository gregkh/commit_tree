net: fec: Fix PHY init after phy_reset_after_clk_enable()

The phy_reset_after_clk_enable() does a PHY reset, which means the PHY
loses its register settings. The fec_enet_mii_probe() starts the PHY
and does the necessary calls to configure the PHY via PHY framework,
and loads the correct register settings into the PHY. Therefore,
fec_enet_mii_probe() should be called only after the PHY has been
reset, not before as it is now.
