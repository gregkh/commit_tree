btrfs: introduce BTRFS_NESTING_SPLIT for split blocks

If we are splitting a leaf/node, we could do something like the
following

lock(leaf)  BTRFS_NESTING_NORMAL
  lock(left) BTRFS_NESTING_LEFT + BTRFS_NESTING_COW
    push from leaf -> left
      reset path to point to left
        split left
          allocate new block, lock block BTRFS_NESTING_SPLIT

at the new block point we need to have a different nesting level,
because we have already used either BTRFS_NESTING_LEFT or
BTRFS_NESTING_RIGHT when pushing items from the original leaf into the
adjacent leaves.
