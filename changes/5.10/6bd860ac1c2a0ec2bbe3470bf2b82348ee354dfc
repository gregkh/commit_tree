chelsio/chtls: CHELSIO_INLINE_CRYPTO should depend on CHELSIO_T4

While CHELSIO_INLINE_CRYPTO is a guard symbol, and just enabling it does
not cause any additional code to be compiled in, all configuration
options protected by it depend on CONFIG_CHELSIO_T4.  Hence it doesn't
make much sense to bother the user with the guard symbol question when
CONFIG_CHELSIO_T4 is disabled.

Fix this by moving the dependency from the individual config options to
the guard symbol.
