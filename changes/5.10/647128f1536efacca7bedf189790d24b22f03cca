x86/platform/uv: Update UV MMRs for UV5

Update UV MMRs in uv_mmrs.h for UV5 based on Verilog output from the
UV Hub hardware design files.  This is the next UV architecture with
a new class (UVY) being defined for 52 bit physical address masks.
Uses a bitmask for UV arch identification so a single test can cover
multiple versions.  Includes other adjustments to match the uv_mmrs.h
file to keep from encountering compile errors.  New UV5 functionality
is added in the patches that follow.

[ Fix W=1 build warnings. ]
