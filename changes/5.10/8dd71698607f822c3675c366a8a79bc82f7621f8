spi: rspi: Clean up Bit Rate Division Setting handling

Add a macro for configuring the Bit Rate Division Setting field in
Command Registers, instead of open-coding the same operation using a
hardcoded shift.
Rename "div" to "brdv", as it is not a plain divider value, but controls
a power-of-two divider.
