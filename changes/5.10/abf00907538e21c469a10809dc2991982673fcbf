spi: dw: Add Baikal-T1 SPI Controller glue driver

Baikal-T1 is equipped with three DW APB SSI-based MMIO SPI controllers.
Two of them are pretty much normal: with IRQ, DMA, FIFOs of 64 words
depth, 4x CSs, but the third one as being a part of the Baikal-T1 System
Boot Controller has got a very limited resources: no IRQ, no DMA, only a
single native chip-select and Tx/Rx FIFO with just 8 words depth
available. In order to provide a transparent initial boot code execution
the Boot SPI controller is also utilized by an vendor-specific IP-block,
which exposes an SPI flash direct mapping interface. Since both direct
mapping and SPI controller normal utilization are mutual exclusive only
one of these interfaces can be used to access an external SPI slave
device. That's why a dedicated mux is embedded into the System Boot
Controller. All of that is taken into account in the Baikal-T1-specific DW
APB SSI glue driver implemented by means of the DW SPI core module.
