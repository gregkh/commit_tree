powerpc/8xx: Always fault when _PAGE_ACCESSED is not set

The kernel expects pte_young() to work regardless of CONFIG_SWAP.

Make sure a minor fault is taken to set _PAGE_ACCESSED when it
is not already set, regardless of the selection of CONFIG_SWAP.

This adds at least 3 instructions to the TLB miss exception
handlers fast path. Following patch will reduce this overhead.

Also update the rotation instruction to the correct number of bits
to reflect all changes done to _PAGE_ACCESSED over time.

Fixes: d069cb4373fe ("powerpc/8xx: Don't touch ACCESSED when no SWAP.")
Fixes: 5f356497c384 ("powerpc/8xx: remove unused _PAGE_WRITETHRU")
Fixes: e0a8e0d90a9f ("powerpc/8xx: Handle PAGE_USER via APG bits")
Fixes: 5b2753fc3e8a ("powerpc/8xx: Implementation of PAGE_EXEC")
Fixes: a891c43b97d3 ("powerpc/8xx: Prepare handlers for _PAGE_HUGE for 512k pages.")
