RDMA/core: Change rdma_get_gid_attr returned error code

Change the error code returned from rdma_get_gid_attr when the GID entry
is invalid but the GID index is in the gid table size range to -ENODATA
instead of -EINVAL.

This change is done in order to provide a more accurate error reporting to
be used by the new GID query API in user space. Nevertheless, -EINVAL is
still returned from sysfs in the aforementioned case to maintain
compatibility with user space that expects -EINVAL.
