bus/fsl-mc: Add a new parameter to dprc_scan_objects function

Prepare the dprc_scan_objects function to be used by
the VFIO mc driver code. The function is used to scan the mc
objects by the bus driver. The same functionality is
needed by the VFIO mc driver, but in this case the
interrupt configuration is delayed until the userspace
configures the interrupts. In order to use the same function
in both drivers add a new parameter.
