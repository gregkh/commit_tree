mei: restrict vtag support to hbm version 2.2

The vtag allows partitioning the mei messages into virtual groups/channels.
Vtags are supported for firmwares with HBM version 2.2 and newer
and only when a firmware confirms the support via capability handshake.
This change only define vtag restrictions in order to make
the series bisectable. Everything will be enabled when driver HBM
version is set to 2.2.
