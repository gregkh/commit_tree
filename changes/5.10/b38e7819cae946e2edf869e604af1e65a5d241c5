icmp: randomize the global rate limiter

Keyu Man reported that the ICMP rate limiter could be used
by attackers to get useful signal. Details will be provided
in an upcoming academic publication.

Our solution is to add some noise, so that the attackers
no longer can get help from the predictable token bucket limiter.
