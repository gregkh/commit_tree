rcu: Fix kerneldoc comments in rcupdate.h

This commit fixes the kerneldoc comments for rcu_read_unlock_bh(),
rcu_read_unlock_sched() and rcu_head_after_call_rcu() so they e.g. get
properly linked in the API documentation. Also add parenthesis after
function names to match the notation used in other kerneldoc comments in
the same file.
