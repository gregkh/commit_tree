ARM: dts: s3c24xx: override nodes by label

Using full paths to extend or override a device tree node is error
prone.  If there was a typo error, a new node will be created instead of
extending the existing node.  This will lead to run-time errors that
could be hard to detect.

A mistyped label on the other hand, will cause a dtc compile error
(during build time).
