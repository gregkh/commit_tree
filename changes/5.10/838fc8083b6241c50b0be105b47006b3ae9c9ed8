Input: soc_button_array - add active_low setting to soc_button_info

This is a preparation patch for adding support for Intel INT33D3
ACPI devices. These INT33D3 devices follow yet another Intel defined
(but not documented) ACPI GPIO button standard.

Unlike the ACPI GPIO button devices supported so far, the GPIO used in
the INT33D3 devices is active-high, rather then active-low.

This commit makes setting the gpio_keys_button.active_low flag
configurable through the soc_button_info struct and enables it for all
currently supported devices.
