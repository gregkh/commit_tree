power: supply: sbs-battery: keep error code when get_property() fails

Commit 395a7251dc2b (power: supply: sbs-battery: don't assume
i2c errors as battery disconnect) overwrites the original error code
returned from internal functions. On such a sporadic i2c error,
a user will get a wrong value without errors.
