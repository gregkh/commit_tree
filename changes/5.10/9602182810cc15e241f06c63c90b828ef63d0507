MAINTAINERS/bpf: Update Andrii's entry.

Andrii has been a de-facto maintainer for libbpf and other components.
Update maintainers entry to acknowledge his work de-jure.

The folks with git write permissions will continue to follow the rule
of not applying their own patches unless absolutely trivial.
