dt-bindings: pinctrl: sunxi: Allow pinctrl with more interrupt banks

Recently introduced Allwinner A100 pinctrl block has 7 interrupts.

This trig a warning when running dtb_checks:
sun50i-a100-allwinner-perf1.dt.yaml: pinctrl@300b000: interrupts: [...] is too long
	From schema: .../allwinner,sun4i-a10-pinctrl.yaml

Fix this by allowing up to 7 interrupts.
