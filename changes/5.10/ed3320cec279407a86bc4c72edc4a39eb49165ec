can: dev: __can_get_echo_skb(): fix real payload length return value for RTR frames

The can_get_echo_skb() function returns the number of received bytes to
be used for netdev statistics. In the case of RTR frames we get a valid
(potential non-zero) data length value which has to be passed for further
operations. But on the wire RTR frames have no payload length. Therefore
the value to be used in the statistics has to be zero for RTR frames.
