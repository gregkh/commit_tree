ARM: imx27: Retrieve the SYSCTRL base address from devicetree

Now that imx27 has been converted to a devicetree-only platform,
retrieve the SYSCTRL base address from devicetree.

To keep devicetree compatibilty the SYSCTRL base address will be
retrieved from the CCM base address plus an 0x800 offset.

This is not a problem as the imx27.dtsi describes the CCM register
range as 0x1000.
