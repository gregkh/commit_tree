arm64: spectre-v2: Favour CPU-specific mitigation at EL2

Spectre-v2 can be mitigated on Falkor CPUs either by calling into
firmware or by issuing a magic, CPU-specific sequence of branches.
Although the latter is faster, the size of the code sequence means that
it cannot be used in the EL2 vectors, and so there is a need for both
mitigations to co-exist in order to achieve optimal performance.

Change the mitigation selection logic for Spectre-v2 so that the
CPU-specific mitigation is used only when the firmware mitigation is
also available, rather than when a firmware mitigation is unavailable.
