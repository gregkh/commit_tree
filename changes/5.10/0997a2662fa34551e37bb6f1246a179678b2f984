perf tools: Add support for exclusive groups/events

Peter suggested that using the exclusive mode in perf could avoid some
problems with bad scheduling of groups. Exclusive is implemented in the
kernel, but wasn't exposed by the perf tool, so hard to use without
custom low level API users.

Add support for marking groups or events with :e for exclusive in the
perf tool.  The implementation is basically the same as the existing
pinned attribute.

Committer testing:

  # perf test "parse event"
   6: Parse event definition strings                                  : Ok
  # perf test -v "parse event" |& grep :u*e
  running test 56 'instructions:uep'
  running test 57 '{cycles,cache-misses,branch-misses}:e'
  #
  #
  # grep "model name" -m1 /proc/cpuinfo
  model name	: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor
  #
  # perf stat -a -e '{cycles,cache-misses,branch-misses}:e' sleep 1

  Some events weren't counted. Try disabling the NMI watchdog:
  	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
  	perf stat ...
  	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
  # echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
  # perf stat -a -e '{cycles,cache-misses,branch-misses}:e' sleep 1

  #
  # The output for asking for precise events on AMD needs to improve, it
  # supposedly works only for system wide or per CPU

  # perf stat -a -e '{cycles,cache-misses,branch-misses}:uep' sleep 1
  Error:
  The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 22 (Invalid argument) for event (cycles).
  /bin/dmesg | grep -i perf may provide additional information.
