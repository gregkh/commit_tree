PCI: Use scnprintf(), not snprintf(), in sysfs "show" functions

Sysfs "show" methods should return the number of bytes printed into the
buffer.  This is the return value of scnprintf() [1].

snprintf(buf, size, ...) prints at most "size" bytes into "buf", but
returns the number of bytes that *would* be printed if "buf" were large
enough.

Replace use of snprintf() with scnprintf().  No functional change intended.
