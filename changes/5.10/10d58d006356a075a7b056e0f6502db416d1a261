bpf, sockmap: Remove skb_orphan and let normal skb_kfree do cleanup

Calling skb_orphan() is unnecessary in the strp rcv handler because the skb
is from a skb_clone() in __strp_recv. So it never has a destructor or a
sk assigned. Plus its confusing to read because it might hint to the reader
that the skb could have an sk assigned which is not true. Even if we did
have an sk assigned it would be cleaner to simply wait for the upcoming
kfree_skb().

Additionally, move the comment about strparser clone up so its closer to
the logic it is describing and add to it so that it is more complete.
