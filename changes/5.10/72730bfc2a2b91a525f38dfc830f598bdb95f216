powerpc/smp: Create coregroup domain

Add percpu coregroup maps and masks to create coregroup domain.
If a coregroup doesn't exist, the coregroup domain will be degenerated
in favour of SMT/CACHE domain. Do note this patch is only creating stubs
for cpu_to_coregroup_id. The actual cpu_to_coregroup_id implementation
would be in a subsequent patch.
