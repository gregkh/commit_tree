media: qt1010: fix usage of unititialized value

As pointed by smatch:

	drivers/media/tuners/qt1010.c:239 qt1010_init_meas1() error: uninitialized symbol 'val2'.
	drivers/media/tuners/qt1010.c:273 qt1010_init_meas2() error: uninitialized symbol 'val'.

The logic is ok, but it is hard for static analyzers
to parse it, as it depends on a value read in the middle
of a loop.

Also, it takes a while for humans to verify.

Re-write the first function to use a more direct way.

At the second one, I opted to just initialize the read var,
in order to shut up the report.

While here, address a few coding style issues at the
function code.
