bpf: Relax return code check for subprograms

Currently verifier enforces return code checks for subprograms in the
same manner as it does for program entry points. This prevents returning
arbitrary scalar values from subprograms. Scalar type of returned values
is checked by btf_prepare_func_args() and hence it should be safe to
allow only scalars for now. Relax return code checks for subprograms and
allow any correct scalar values.
