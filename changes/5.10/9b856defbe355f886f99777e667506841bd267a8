drm/amdgpu: update eeprom once specifying one bigger threshold(v3)

During driver's probe, when it hits bad gpu tag in eeprom i2c
init calling(the tag was set when reported bad page reaches
bad page threshold in last driver's working loop), there are
some strategys to deal with the cases:

1. when the module parameter amdgpu_bad_page_threshold = 0,
that means page retirement feature is disabled, so just resetting
the eeprom is fine.
2. When amdgpu_bad_page_threshold is not 0, and moreover, user
sets one bigger valid data in order to make current boot up
succeeds, correct eeprom header tag and do not break booting.
3. For other cases, driver's probe will be broken.

v2: Just update eeprom header tag instead of resetting the whole
    table header when user sets one bigger threshold data.

v3: Use dev_info/dev_err to print PCI device information, which
    helps in mGPU case.
