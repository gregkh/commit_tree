libbpf: Fix libbpf build on compilers missing __builtin_mul_overflow

GCC compilers older than version 5 don't support __builtin_mul_overflow yet.
Given GCC 4.9 is the minimal supported compiler for building kernel and the
fact that libbpf is a dependency of resolve_btfids, which is dependency of
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y, this needs to be handled. This patch fixes the issue
by falling back to slower detection of integer overflow in such cases.
