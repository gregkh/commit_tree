xsk: i40e: ice: ixgbe: mlx5: Pass buffer pool to driver instead of umem

Replace the explicit umem reference passed to the driver in AF_XDP
zero-copy mode with the buffer pool instead. This in preparation for
extending the functionality of the zero-copy mode so that umems can be
shared between queues on the same netdev and also between netdevs. In
this commit, only an umem reference has been added to the buffer pool
struct. But later commits will add other entities to it. These are
going to be entities that are different between different queue ids
and netdevs even though the umem is shared between them.
