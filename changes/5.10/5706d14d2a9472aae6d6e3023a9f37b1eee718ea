KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XICS: Replace the 'destroy' method by a 'release' method

Similarly to what was done with XICS-on-XIVE and XIVE native KVM devices
with commit 5422e95103cf ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Replace the 'destroy'
method by a 'release' method"), convert the historical XICS KVM device to
implement the 'release' method. This is needed to run nested guests with
an in-kernel IRQ chip. A typical POWER9 guest can select XICS or XIVE
during boot, which requires to be able to destroy and to re-create the
KVM device. Only the historical XICS KVM device is available under pseries
at the current time and it still uses the legacy 'destroy' method.

Switching to 'release' means that vCPUs might still be running when the
device is destroyed. In order to avoid potential use-after-free, the
kvmppc_xics structure is allocated on first usage and kept around until
the VM exits. The same pointer is used each time a KVM XICS device is
being created, but this is okay since we only have one per VM.

Clear the ICP of each vCPU with vcpu->mutex held. This ensures that the
next time the vCPU resumes execution, it won't be going into the XICS
code anymore.
