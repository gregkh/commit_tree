PM: runtime: Fix timer_expires data type on 32-bit arches

Commit 8234f6734c5d ("PM-runtime: Switch autosuspend over to using
hrtimers") switched PM runtime autosuspend to use hrtimers and all
related time accounting in ns, but missed to update the timer_expires
data type in struct dev_pm_info to u64.

This causes the timer_expires value to be truncated on 32-bit
architectures when assignment is done from u64 values:

rpm_suspend()
|- dev->power.timer_expires = expires;

Fix it by changing the timer_expires type to u64.
