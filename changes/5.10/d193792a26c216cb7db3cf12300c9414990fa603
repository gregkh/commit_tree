mtd: nand: Create a helper to extract the ECC configuration

Despite its current name, the eccreq field actually encodes both the
NAND requirements and the final ECC configuration. That works fine when
using on-die ECC since those 2 concepts match perfectly, but it starts
being a problem as soon as we use on-host ECC engines, where we're not
guaranteed to have a perfect match.

Let's hide the ECC configuration access behind a helper so we can later
split those 2 concepts.
