x86/mce: Stop mce_reign() from re-computing severity for every CPU

Back in commit:

  20d51a426fe9 ("x86/mce: Reuse one of the u16 padding fields in 'struct mce'")

a field was added to "struct mce" to save the computed error severity.

Make use of this in mce_reign() to avoid re-computing the severity
for every CPU.

In the case where the machine panics, one call to mce_severity() is
still needed in order to provide the correct message giving the reason
for the panic.
