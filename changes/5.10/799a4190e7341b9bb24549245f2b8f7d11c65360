kvm: x86/mmu: Separate making SPTEs from set_spte

Separate the functions for generating leaf page table entries from the
function that inserts them into the paging structure. This refactoring
will facilitate changes to the MMU sychronization model to use atomic
compare / exchanges (which are not guaranteed to succeed) instead of a
monolithic MMU lock.

No functional change expected.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This commit introduced no new failures.
