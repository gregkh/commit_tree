drm/i915: Fix TGL DKL PHY DP vswing handling

The HDMI vs. not-HDMI check got inverted whem the bogus encoder->type
checks were eliminated. So now we're using 0 as the link rate on DP
and potentially non-zero on HDMI, which is exactly the opposite of
what we want. The original bogus check actually worked more correctly
by accident since if would always evaluate to true. Due to this we
now always use the RBR/HBR1 vswing table and never ever the HBR2+
vswing table. That is probably not a good way to get a high quality
signal at HBR2+ rates. Fix the check so we pick the right table.
