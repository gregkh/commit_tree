remoteproc/mediatek: fix null pointer dereference on null scp pointer

Currently when pointer scp is null a dev_err is being called that
references the pointer which is the very thing we are trying to
avoid doing. Remove the extraneous error message to avoid this
issue.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference after null check")
