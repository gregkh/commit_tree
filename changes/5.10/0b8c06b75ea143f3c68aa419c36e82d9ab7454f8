tools/memory-model: Add a simple entry point document

Current LKMM documentation assumes that the reader already understands
concurrency in the Linux kernel, which won't necessarily always be the

point for someone who is new to concurrency in the Linux kernel.
That said, this file might also useful as a reminder to experienced
developers of simpler approaches to dealing with concurrency.
