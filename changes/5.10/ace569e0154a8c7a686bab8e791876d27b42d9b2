KVM: x86/mmu: Move flush logic from mmu_page_zap_pte() to FNAME(invlpg)

Move the logic that controls whether or not FNAME(invlpg) needs to flush
fully into FNAME(invlpg) so that mmu_page_zap_pte() doesn't return a
value.  This allows a future patch to redefine the return semantics for
mmu_page_zap_pte() so that it can recursively zap orphaned child shadow
pages for nested TDP MMUs.

No functional change intended.
