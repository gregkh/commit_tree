ASoC: codec: tlv3204: Moving GPIO reset and add ADC reset

Moving GPIO reset to a later stage and before clock registration to
ensure that the host system and codec clocks are in sync. If the host
register clock values prior to gpio reset, the last configured codec clock
is registered to the host. The codec then gets gpio resetted setting the
codec clocks to their default value, causing a mismatch. Host system will
skip clock setting thinking the codec clocks are already at the requested
rate.

ADC reset is added to ensure the next audio capture does not have
undesired artifacts. It is probably related to the original code
where the probe function resets the ADC prior to 1st record.
