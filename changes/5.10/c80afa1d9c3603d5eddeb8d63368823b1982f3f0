afs: Fix warning due to unadvanced marshalling pointer

When using the afs.yfs.acl xattr to change an AuriStor ACL, a warning
can be generated when the request is marshalled because the buffer
pointer isn't increased after adding the last element, thereby
triggering the check at the end if the ACL wasn't empty.  This just
causes something like the following warning, but doesn't stop the call
from happening successfully:

    kAFS: YFS.StoreOpaqueACL2: Request buffer underflow (36<108)

Fix this simply by increasing the count prior to the check.
