MAINTAINERS: mark linux-samsung-soc list non-moderated

In fifteen entries mentioning linux-samsung-soc@vger.kernel.org in
MAINTAINERS, seven entries mention the list being moderated for
non-subscribers and eight entries do not. Clearly only one can be right,
though.

Joe Perches suggested that all vger.kernel.org are not moderated for
non-subscribers.

Remove all the remarks from the entries following Joe's suggestion.
