drop_monitor: Convert to using devlink tracepoint

Convert drop monitor to use the recently introduced
'devlink_trap_report' tracepoint instead of having devlink call into
drop monitor.

This is both consistent with software originated drops ('kfree_skb'
tracepoint) and also allows drop monitor to be built as a module and
still report hardware originated drops.
