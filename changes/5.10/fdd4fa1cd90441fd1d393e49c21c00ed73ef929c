mm/page_alloc.c: fix early params garbage value accesses

Previously in '__init early_init_on_alloc' and '__init early_init_on_free'
the return values from 'kstrtobool' were not handled properly.  That
caused potential garbage value read from variable 'bool_result'.
Introduced patch fixes error handling.
