arch_topology: validate input frequencies to arch_set_freq_scale()

The current frequency passed to arch_set_freq_scale() could end up
being 0, signaling an error in setting a new frequency. Also, if the
maximum frequency in 0, this will result in a division by 0 error.

Therefore, validate these input values before using them for the
setting of the frequency scale factor.
