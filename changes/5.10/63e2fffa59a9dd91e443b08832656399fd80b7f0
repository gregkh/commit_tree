pNFS/flexfiles: Fix array overflow when flexfiles mirroring is enabled

If the flexfiles mirroring is enabled, then the read code expects to be
able to set pgio->pg_mirror_idx to point to the data server that is
being used for this particular read. However it does not change the
pg_mirror_count because we only need to send a single read.
