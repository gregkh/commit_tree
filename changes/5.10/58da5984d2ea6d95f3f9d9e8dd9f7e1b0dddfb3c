powerpc/watchpoint: Add hw_len wherever missing

There are couple of places where we set len but not hw_len. For
ptrace/perf watchpoints, when CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT=Y, hw_len
will be calculated and set internally while parsing watchpoint.
But when CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT=N, we need to manually set
'hw_len'. Similarly for xmon as well, hw_len needs to be set
directly.
