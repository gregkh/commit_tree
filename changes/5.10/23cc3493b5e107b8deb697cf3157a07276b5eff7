iommu/uapi: Rename uapi functions

User APIs such as iommu_sva_unbind_gpasid() may also be used by the
kernel. Since we introduced user pointer to the UAPI functions,
in-kernel callers cannot share the same APIs. In-kernel callers are also
trusted, there is no need to validate the data.

We plan to have two flavors of the same API functions, one called
through ioctls, carrying a user pointer and one called directly with
valid IOMMU UAPI structs. To differentiate both, let's rename existing
functions with an iommu_uapi_ prefix.
