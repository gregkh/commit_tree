selftests/bpf: Drain ringbuf samples at the end of test

Avoid occasional test failures due to the last sample being delayed to
another ring_buffer__poll() call. Instead, drain samples completely with
ring_buffer__consume(). This is supposed to fix a rare and non-deterministic
test failure in libbpf CI.
