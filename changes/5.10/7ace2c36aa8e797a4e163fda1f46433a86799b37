mlxsw: spectrum: Move here the three-step headroom configuration from DCB

The ETS handler performs the headroom configuration in three steps: first
it resizes the buffers and adds any new ones. Then it redirects priorities
to the new buffers. And finally it sets the size of the now-unused buffers
to zero. This way no packet drops are introduced.

This sort of careful approach will also be useful for configuring port
buffer sizes and priority map by hand, through dcbnl_setbuffer. Therefore
move the code from the DCB handler to the generic headroom function.
