RDMA/ocrdma: Use ib_umem_num_dma_blocks() instead of ib_umem_page_count()

This driver always uses a DMA array made up of PAGE_SIZE elements, so just
use ib_umem_num_dma_blocks().

Since rdma_for_each_dma_block() always iterates exactly
ib_umem_num_dma_blocks() there is no need for the early exit check in
build_user_pbes(), delete it.
