efi/x86: Add a quirk to support command line arguments on Dell EFI firmware

At least some versions of Dell EFI firmware pass the entire
EFI_LOAD_OPTION descriptor, rather than just the OptionalData part, to
the loaded image. This was verified with firmware revision 2.15.0 on a
Dell Precision T3620 by Jacobo Pantoja.

To handle this, add a quirk to check if the options look like a valid
EFI_LOAD_OPTION descriptor, and if so, use the OptionalData part as the
command line.
