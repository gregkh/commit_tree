PM: runtime: Drop pm_runtime_clean_up_links()

After commit d12544fb2aa9 ("PM: runtime: Remove link state checks in
rpm_get/put_supplier()") nothing prevents the consumer device's
runtime PM from acquiring additional references to the supplier
device after pm_runtime_clean_up_links() has run (or even while it
is running), so calling this function from __device_release_driver()
may be pointless (or even harmful).

Moreover, it ignores stateless device links, so the runtime PM
handling of managed and stateless device links is inconsistent
because of it, so better get rid of it entirely.
