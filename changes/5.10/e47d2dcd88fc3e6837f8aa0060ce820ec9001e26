ASoC: sun8i-codec: Add missing mixer routes

The sun8i-codec driver provides ALSA controls for enabling/disabling
each of the inputs to the AIF1 Slot 0 and DAC mixers. For two of these
inputs (ADC->DAC and AIF1 DA0->AIF1 AD0), the audio source is
implemented, so the mixer inputs can be used.

However, because the DAPM routes are missing, these mixer inputs only
work when both the source and the mixer happen to be part of other
active audio paths. Adding the appropriate routes makes these ALSA
controls function all of the time.
