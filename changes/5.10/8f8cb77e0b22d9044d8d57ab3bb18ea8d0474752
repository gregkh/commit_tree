net: bridge: mcast: add rt_protocol field to the port group struct

We need to be able to differentiate between pg entries created by
user-space and the kernel when we start generating S,G entries for
IGMPv3/MLDv2's fast path. User-space entries are created by default as
RTPROT_STATIC and the kernel entries are RTPROT_KERNEL. Later we can
allow user-space to provide the entry rt_protocol so we can
differentiate between who added the entries specifically (e.g. clag,
admin, frr etc).
