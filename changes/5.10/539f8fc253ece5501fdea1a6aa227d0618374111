drivers: optee: fix i2c build issue

When the optee driver is compiled into the kernel while the i2c core
is configured as a module, the i2c symbols are not available.

This commit addresses the situation by disabling the i2c support for
this use case while allowing it in all other scenarios:

 i2c=y, optee=y
 i2c=m, optee=m
 i2c=y, optee=m
 i2c=m, optee=y (not supported)
