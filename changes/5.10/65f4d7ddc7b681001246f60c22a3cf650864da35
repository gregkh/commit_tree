clocksource/drivers/sp804: Remove unused sp804_timer_disable() and timer-sp804.h

Since commit 7484c727b636 ("ARM: realview: delete the RealView board
files") and commit 16956fed35fe ("ARM: versatile: switch to DT only
booting and remove legacy code"), there's no one to use the functions
defined or declared in include/clocksource/timer-sp804.h. Delete it.
