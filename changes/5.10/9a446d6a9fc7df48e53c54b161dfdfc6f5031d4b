btrfs: replace readpage_end_io_hook with direct calls

Don't call readpage_end_io_hook for the btree inode.  Instead of relying
on indirect calls to implement metadata buffer validation simply check
if the inode whose page we are processing equals the btree inode. If it
does call the necessary function.

This is an improvement in 2 directions:

1. We aren't paying the penalty of indirect calls in a post-speculation
   attacks world.

2. The function is now named more explicitly so it's obvious what's
   going on

This is in preparation to removing struct extent_io_ops altogether.
