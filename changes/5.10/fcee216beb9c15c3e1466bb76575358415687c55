fuse: split fuse_mount off of fuse_conn

We want to allow submounts for the same fuse_conn, but with different
superblocks so that each of the submounts has its own device ID.  To do
so, we need to split all mount-specific information off of fuse_conn
into a new fuse_mount structure, so that multiple mounts can share a
single fuse_conn.

We need to take care only to perform connection-level actions once (i.e.
when the fuse_conn and thus the first fuse_mount are established, or
when the last fuse_mount and thus the fuse_conn are destroyed).  For
example, fuse_sb_destroy() must invoke fuse_send_destroy() until the
last superblock is released.

To do so, we keep track of which fuse_mount is the root mount and
perform all fuse_conn-level actions only when this fuse_mount is
involved.
