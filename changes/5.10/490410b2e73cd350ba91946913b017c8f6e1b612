usb: dwc3: gadget: Check for number of TRBs prepared

By returning the number of TRBs prepared, we know whether to execute
__dwc3_gadget_kick_transfer(). This allows us to check if we ran out of
TRBs when extra TRBs are needed for OUT transfers. It also allows us to
properly handle usb_gadget_map_request_by_dev() error.
