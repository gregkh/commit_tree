drm/i915/gt: Hold context/request reference while breadcrumbs are active

Currently we hold no actual reference to the request nor context while
they are attached to a breadcrumb. To avoid freeing the request/context
too early, we serialise with cancel-breadcrumbs by taking the irq
spinlock in i915_request_retire(). The alternative is to take a
reference for a new breadcrumb and release it upon signaling; removing
the more frequently hit contention point in i915_request_retire().
