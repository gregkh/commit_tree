iommu/dma: Remove broken huge page handling

The attempt to handle huge page allocations was originally added since
the comments around stripping __GFP_COMP in other implementations were
nonsensical, and we naively assumed that split_huge_page() could simply
be called equivalently to split_page(). It turns out that this doesn't
actually work correctly, so just get rid of it - there's little point
going to the effort of allocating huge pages if we're only going to
split them anyway.
