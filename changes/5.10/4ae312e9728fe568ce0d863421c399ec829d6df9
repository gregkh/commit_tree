btrfs: remove redundant code from btrfs_free_stale_devices

Following the refactor of btrfs_free_stale_devices in
7bcb8164ad94 ("btrfs: use device_list_mutex when removing stale devices")
fs_devices are freed after they have been iterated by the inner
list_for_each so the use-after-free fixed by introducing the break in
fd649f10c3d2 ("btrfs: Fix use-after-free when cleaning up fs_devs with
a single stale device") is no longer necessary. Just remove it
altogether. No functional changes.
