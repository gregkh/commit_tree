media: uvcvideo: Fix uvc_ctrl_fixup_xu_info() not having any effect

uvc_ctrl_add_info() calls uvc_ctrl_get_flags() which will override
the fixed-up flags set by uvc_ctrl_fixup_xu_info().

uvc_ctrl_init_xu_ctrl() already calls uvc_ctrl_get_flags() before
calling uvc_ctrl_add_info(), so the uvc_ctrl_get_flags() call in
uvc_ctrl_add_info() is not necessary for xu ctrls.

This commit moves the uvc_ctrl_get_flags() call for normal controls
from uvc_ctrl_add_info() to uvc_ctrl_init_ctrl(), so that we no longer
call uvc_ctrl_get_flags() twice for xu controls and so that we no longer
override the fixed-up flags set by uvc_ctrl_fixup_xu_info().

This fixes the xu motor controls not working properly on a Logitech
046d:08cc, and presumably also on the other Logitech models which have
a quirk for this in the uvc_ctrl_fixup_xu_info() function.
