scsi: ufs: Fix NOP OUT timeout value

Boot occasionally fails with some Samsung low-power UFS devices. The reason
is that these devices have a little bit higher latency for NOP OUT
responses. This causes boot to fail because the NOP OUT command is issued
during initialization to check whether the device transport protocol is
ready or not. Increase NOP_OUT_TIMEOUT value from 30 to 50ms.
