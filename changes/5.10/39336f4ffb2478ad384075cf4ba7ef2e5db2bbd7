x86/efi: Add GHCB mappings when SEV-ES is active

Calling down to EFI runtime services can result in the firmware
performing VMGEXIT calls. The firmware is likely to use the GHCB of the
OS (e.g., for setting EFI variables), so each GHCB in the system needs
to be identity-mapped in the EFI page tables, as unencrypted, to avoid
page faults.
