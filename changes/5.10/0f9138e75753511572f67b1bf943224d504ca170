soundwire: intel: enable test modes

This patch adds debugfs support to override the Master and Slave data
modes. The settings only take effect prior to a new stream being
prepared/enabled, or on resume.

The test mode can be set to verify data integrity and detect bus
clashes, but can only be used to test capture paths. In this case the
input generated by a Slave source port is replaced by a fixed or
cyclical patterns.
