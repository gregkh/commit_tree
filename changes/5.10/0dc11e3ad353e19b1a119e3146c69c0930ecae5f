gpiolib: cdev: gpio_desc_to_lineinfo() should set info offset

Set the value of the line info offset in gpio_desc_to_lineinfo(), rather
than relying on it being passed in the info.  This makes the function
behave as you would expect from the name - it generates the line info
corresponding to a given GPIO desc.
