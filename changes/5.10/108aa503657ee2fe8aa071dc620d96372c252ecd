arm64: kexec_file: try more regions if loading segments fails

It's possible that the first region picked for the new kernel will make
it impossible to fit the other segments in the required 32GB window,
especially if we have a very large initrd.

Instead of giving up, we can keep testing other regions for the kernel
until we find one that works.
