io_uring: split SQPOLL data into separate structure

Move all the necessary state out of io_ring_ctx, and into a new
structure, io_sq_data. The latter now deals with any state or
variables associated with the SQPOLL thread itself.

In preparation for supporting more than one io_ring_ctx per SQPOLL
thread.
