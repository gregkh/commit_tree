can: flexcan: remove ack_grp and ack_bit handling from driver

Since commit:

    048e3a34a2e7 can: flexcan: poll MCR_LPM_ACK instead of GPR ACK for stop mode acknowledgment

the driver polls the IP core's internal bit MCR[LPM_ACK] as stop mode
acknowledge and not the acknowledgment on chip level.

This means the 4th and 5th value of the property "fsl,stop-mode" isn't used
anymore. This patch removes the used "ack_gpr" and "ack_bit" from the driver.
