efi: mokvar-table: fix some issues in new code

Fix a couple of issues in the new mokvar-table handling code, as
pointed out by Arvind and Boris:
- don't bother checking the end of the physical region against the start
  address of the mokvar table,
- ensure that we enter the loop with err = -EINVAL,
- replace size_t with unsigned long to appease pedantic type equality
  checks.
