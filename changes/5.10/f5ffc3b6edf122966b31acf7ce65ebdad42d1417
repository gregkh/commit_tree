media: vidtv: implement a demodulator driver

Implement a I2C demodulator driver, simulating support for DVB-T, DVB-C
and DVB-S.

This demodulator will periodically check the signal quality against a table
and drop the TS lock if it drops below a threshold value, regaining it in
the event that the signal improves.
