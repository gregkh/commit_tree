arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Add MSM8916-specific compatibles to SCM/MSS

Over the time, the SCM and MSS driver were refactored to use
SoC-specific compatibles. While the generic compatibles still work
correctly, add the MSM8916-specific compatibles so they are actually
used somewhere.

For SCM this will ensure that we actually manage to obtain all
three of the specified clocks, since those are required on MSM8916.
