ASoC: Intel: soc-acpi: add support for SDCA boards

The description and board layout is similar to previous ones for
CometLake and TigerLake, except for a bump to SoundWire 1.2 and
updates to part numbers to reflect the SDCA (SoundWire Device Class
for Audio) hardware support.

Note that one of the RT1316 amplifiers uses a non-zero UniqueID which
is not required and will be ignored.
