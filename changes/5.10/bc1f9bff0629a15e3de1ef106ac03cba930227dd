arm64: dts: rockchip: change spdif fallback compatible on rk3308

A test with the command below shows that the compatible string

"rockchip,rk3308-spdif", "rockchip,rk3328-spdif"

is already in use, but is not added to a document.
The current fallback string "rockchip,rk3328-spdif" points to a data
set enum RK_SPDIF_RK3366 in rockchip_spdif.c that is not used both
in the mainline as in the manufacturer kernel.
(Of the enum only RK_SPDIF_RK3288 is used.)
So if the properties don't change we might as well use the first SoC
in line as fallback string and add the description for rk3308 as:

"rockchip,rk3308-spdif", "rockchip,rk3066-spdif"
