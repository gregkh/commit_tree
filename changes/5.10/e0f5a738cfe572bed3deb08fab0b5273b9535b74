drm/ast: Embed struct drm_device in struct ast_private

Turns struct ast_private into a subclass of struct drm_device by
embedding the latter. This allows for using DRM's managed device
allocation.

The use of struct drm_device.dev_private is deprecated. The patch
converts the last remaining users to to_ast_private().
