ALSA: usb-audio: Correct wrongly matching entries with audio class

The commit 51ab5d77dcb8 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Properly match with audio
interface class") converted the quirk entries that have both vid/pid
pair and bInterface fields to match with all those with a new macro
USB_AUDIO_CLASS().  However, it turned out that those are false
conversions; all those (but the unknown KeithMcMillen device) are
actually with vendor-specific interface class, hence the conversions
broke the matching.

This patch corrects those entries to the right one,
USB_DEVICE_VENDOR_SPEC() (and USB_DEVICE() for KeithMcMillen to be
sure), and drop the unused USB_AUDIO_CLASS macro again.
