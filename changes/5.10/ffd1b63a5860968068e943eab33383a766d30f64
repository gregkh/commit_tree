KVM: arm64: Ensure user_mem_abort() return value is initialised

If a change in the MMU notifier sequence number forces user_mem_abort()
to return early when attempting to handle a stage-2 fault, we return
uninitialised stack to kvm_handle_guest_abort(), which could potentially
result in the injection of an external abort into the guest or a spurious
return to userspace. Neither or these are what we want to do.

Initialise 'ret' to 0 in user_mem_abort() so that bailing due to a
change in the MMU notrifier sequence number is treated as though the
fault was handled.
