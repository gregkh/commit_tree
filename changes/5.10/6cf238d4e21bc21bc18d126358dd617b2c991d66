memory: omap-gpmc: Fix -Wunused-function warnings

If CONFIG_OF is not set, make W=1 warns:

  drivers/memory/omap-gpmc.c:987:12: warning: ‘gpmc_cs_remap’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
  drivers/memory/omap-gpmc.c:926:20: warning: ‘gpmc_cs_get_name’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
  drivers/memory/omap-gpmc.c:919:13: warning: ‘gpmc_cs_set_name’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

Move them to #ifdef CONFIG_OF block to fix this.
