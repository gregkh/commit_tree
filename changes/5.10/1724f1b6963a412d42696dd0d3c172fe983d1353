memory: omap-gpmc: remove GPMC_SET_ONE_CD_MAX macro for safety

The GPMC_SET_ONE_CD_MAX macro uses return statement and variable 'cs'
coming from called scope.  This is not a good practice.  Also
checkpatch complained:

    WARNING: Macros with flow control statements should be avoided
    ERROR: Macros starting with if should be enclosed by a do - while
        loop to avoid possible if/else logic defects

Since GPMC_SET_ONE_CD_MAX macro just calls one function, it can be open
coded.  The difference with original code is that function will exit on
error not after every register set, but after a group of sets.
