mac80211: get correct default channel width for S1G

When deleting a channel context, mac80211 would assing
NL80211_CHAN_WIDTH_20_NOHT as the default channel width.
This is wrong in S1G however, so instead get the allowed
channel width for a given channel.

Fixes eg. configuring strange (20Mhz) width during a scan
on the S1G band.
