mm: memcontrol: add the missing numa_stat interface for cgroup v2

In the cgroup v1, we have a numa_stat interface.  This is useful for
providing visibility into the numa locality information within an memcg
since the pages are allowed to be allocated from any physical node.  One
of the use cases is evaluating application performance by combining this
information with the application's CPU allocation.  But the cgroup v2 does
not.  So this patch adds the missing information.
