arm64: dts: marvell: espressobin: Add ethernet switch aliases

Espressobin boards have 3 ethernet ports and some of them got assigned more
then one MAC address. MAC addresses are stored in U-Boot environment.

Since commit a2c7023f7075c ("net: dsa: read mac address from DT for slave
device") kernel can use MAC addresses from DT for particular DSA port.

Currently Espressobin DTS file contains alias just for ethernet0.

This patch defines additional ethernet aliases in Espressobin DTS files, so
bootloader can fill correct MAC address for DSA switch ports if more MAC
addresses were specified.

DT alias ethernet1 is used for wan port, DT aliases ethernet2 and ethernet3
are used for lan ports for both Espressobin revisions (V5 and V7).
