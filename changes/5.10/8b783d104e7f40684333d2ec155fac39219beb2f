mac80211: handle lack of sband->bitrates in rates

Even though a driver or mac80211 shouldn't produce a
legacy bitrate if sband->bitrates doesn't exist, don't
crash if that is the case either.

This fixes a kernel panic if station dump is run before
last_rate can be updated with a data frame when
sband->bitrates is missing (eg. in S1G bands).
