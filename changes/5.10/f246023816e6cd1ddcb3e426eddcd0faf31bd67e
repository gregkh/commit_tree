sound: usx2y: move to use usb_control_msg_send()

The usb_control_msg_send() call can handle data on the stack, as well as
returning an error if a "short" write happens, so move the driver over
to using that call instead.  This ends up removing a helper function
that is no longer needed.

v2: API change in usb_control_msg_send()
