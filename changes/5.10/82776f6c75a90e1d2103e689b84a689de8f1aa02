tty: serial: 21285: fix lockup on open

Commit 293f89959483 ("tty: serial: 21285: stop using the unused[]
variable from struct uart_port") introduced a bug which stops the
transmit interrupt being disabled when there are no characters to
transmit - disabling the transmit interrupt at the interrupt controller
is the only way to stop an interrupt storm. If this interrupt is not
disabled when there are no transmit characters, we end up with an
interrupt storm which prevents the machine making forward progress.
