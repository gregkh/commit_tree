ARM: dts: s5pv210: add RTC 32 KHz clock in SMDKC110

The S3C RTC requires 32768 Hz clock as input which is provided by PMIC.
However the PMIC is not described in DTS at all so at least add
a workaround to model its clock with a fixed-clock.

This fixes dtbs_check warnings:

  rtc@e2800000: clocks: [[2, 145]] is too short
  rtc@e2800000: clock-names: ['rtc'] is too short
