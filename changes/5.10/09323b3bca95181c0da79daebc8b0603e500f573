net: ena: set initial DMA width to avoid intel iommu issue

The ENA driver uses the readless mechanism, which uses DMA, to find
out what the DMA mask is supposed to be.

If DMA is used without setting the dma_mask first, it causes the
Intel IOMMU driver to think that ENA is a 32-bit device and therefore
disables IOMMU passthrough permanently.

This patch sets the dma_mask to be ENA_MAX_PHYS_ADDR_SIZE_BITS=48
before readless initialization in
ena_device_init()->ena_com_mmio_reg_read_request_init(),
which is large enough to workaround the intel_iommu issue.

DMA mask is set again to the correct value after it's received from the
device after readless is initialized.

The patch also changes the driver to use dma_set_mask_and_coherent()
function instead of the two pci_set_dma_mask() and
pci_set_consistent_dma_mask() ones. Both methods achieve the same
effect.
