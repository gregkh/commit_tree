spi: dw: Clear IRQ status on DW SPI controller reset

It turns out the IRQ status isn't cleared after switching the controller
off and getting it back on, which may cause raising false error interrupts
if controller has been unsuccessfully used by, for instance, a bootloader
before the driver is loaded. Let's explicitly clear the interrupts status
in the dedicated controller reset method.
