perf hists browser: Increase size of 'buf' in perf_evsel__hists_browse()

Making perf with gcc-9.1.1 generates the following warning:

    CC       ui/browsers/hists.o
  ui/browsers/hists.c: In function 'perf_evsel__hists_browse':
  ui/browsers/hists.c:3078:61: error: '%d' directive output may be \
  truncated writing between 1 and 11 bytes into a region of size \
  between 2 and 12 [-Werror=format-truncation=]

   3078 |       "Max event group index to sort is %d (index from 0 to %d)",
        |                                                             ^~
  ui/browsers/hists.c:3078:7: note: directive argument in the range [-2147483648, 8]
   3078 |       "Max event group index to sort is %d (index from 0 to %d)",
        |       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In file included from /usr/include/stdio.h:937,
                   from ui/browsers/hists.c:5:

IOW, the string in line 3078 might be too long for buf[] of 64 bytes.

Fix this by increasing the size of buf[] to 128.
