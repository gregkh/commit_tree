wcn36xx: Remove dead code in wcn36xx_smd_config_bss()

wcn36xx_smd_config_bss_v0() and wcn36xx_smd_config_bss_v1() have been
designed to operate in standalone fashion. As a result we can drop the
dead code now present in wcn36xx_smd_config_bss() and happily remove one
kzalloc from the BSS config path as we do so.
