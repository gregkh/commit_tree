can: m_can: m_can_handle_state_change(): fix state change

m_can_handle_state_change() is called with the new_state as an argument.

In the switch statements for CAN_STATE_ERROR_ACTIVE, the comment and the
following code indicate that a CAN_STATE_ERROR_WARNING is handled.

This patch fixes this problem by changing the case to CAN_STATE_ERROR_WARNING.
