wireguard: selftests: check that route_me_harder packets use the right sk

If netfilter changes the packet mark, the packet is rerouted. The
ip_route_me_harder family of functions fails to use the right sk, opting
to instead use skb->sk, resulting in a routing loop when used with
tunnels. With the next change fixing this issue in netfilter, test for
the relevant condition inside our test suite, since wireguard was where
the bug was discovered.
