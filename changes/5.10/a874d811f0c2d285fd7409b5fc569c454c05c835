spi: dw-dma: Configure the DMA channels in dma_setup

Mainly this is a preparation patch before adding one-by-one DMA SG entries
transmission. But logically the Tx and Rx DMA channels setup should be
performed in the dma_setup() callback anyway. So we'll move the DMA slave
channels src/dst burst lengths, address and address width configuration
from the Tx/Rx channels preparation methods to the dedicated functions and
then make sure it's called at the DMA setup stage.

Note we now make sure the return value of the dmaengine_slave_config()
method doesn't indicate an error. It has been unnecessary in case if Dw
DMAC is utilized as a DMA engine, since its device_config() callback
always returns zero (though it might change in future). But since DW APB
SSI driver now supports any DMA back-end we must make sure the DMA device
configuration has been successful before proceeding with further setups.
