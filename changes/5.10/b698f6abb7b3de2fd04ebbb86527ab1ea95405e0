mmc: sdio: Export SDIO revision and info strings to userspace

For SDIO functions, SDIO cards and SD COMBO cards are exported revision
number and info strings from CISTPL_VERS_1 structure. Revision number
should indicate compliance of standard and info strings should contain
product information in same format as product information for PCMCIA cards.

Product information for PCMCIA cards should contain following strings in
this order: Manufacturer, Product Name, Lot number, Programming Conditions.

Note that not all SDIO cards export all those info strings in that order as
described in PCMCIA Metaformat Specification.
