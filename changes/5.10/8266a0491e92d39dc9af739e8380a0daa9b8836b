net: bridge: mcast: handle port group filter modes

We need to handle group filter mode transitions and initial state.
To change a port group's INCLUDE -> EXCLUDE mode (or when we have added
a new port group in EXCLUDE mode) we need to add that port to all of
*,G ports' S,G entries for proper replication. When the EXCLUDE state is
changed from IGMPv3 report, br_multicast_fwd_filter_exclude() must be
called after the source list processing because the assumption is that
all of the group's S,G entries will be created before transitioning to
EXCLUDE mode, i.e. most importantly its blocked entries will already be
added so it will not get automatically added to them.
The transition EXCLUDE -> INCLUDE happens only when a port group timer
expires, it requires us to remove that port from all of *,G ports' S,G
entries where it was automatically added previously.
Finally when we are adding a new S,G entry we must add all of *,G's
EXCLUDE ports to it.
In order to distinguish automatically added *,G EXCLUDE ports we have a
new port group flag - MDB_PG_FLAGS_STAR_EXCL.
