devlink: Fix per port reporter fields initialization

Cited patch in fixes tag initializes reporters_list and reporters_lock
of a devlink port after devlink port is added to the list. Once port
is added to the list, devlink_nl_cmd_health_reporter_get_dumpit()
can access the uninitialized mutex and reporters list head.
Fix it by initializing port reporters field before adding port to the
list.
