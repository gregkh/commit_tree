static_call: Allow early init

In order to use static_call() to wire up x86_pmu, we need to
initialize earlier, specifically before memory allocation works; copy
some of the tricks from jump_label to enable this.

Primarily we overload key->next to store a sites pointer when there
are no modules, this avoids having to use kmalloc() to initialize the
sites and allows us to run much earlier.
