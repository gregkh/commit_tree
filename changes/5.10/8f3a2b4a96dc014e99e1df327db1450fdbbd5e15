RISC-V: Move DT mapping outof fixmap

Currently, RISC-V reserves 1MB of fixmap memory for device tree. However,
it maps only single PMD (2MB) space for fixmap which leaves only < 1MB space
left for other kernel features such as early ioremap which requires fixmap
as well. The fixmap size can be increased by another 2MB but it brings
additional complexity and changes the virtual memory layout as well.
If we require some additional feature requiring fixmap again, it has to be
moved again.

Technically, DT doesn't need a fixmap as the memory occupied by the DT is
only used during boot. That's why, We map device tree in early page table
using two consecutive PGD mappings at lower addresses (< PAGE_OFFSET).
This frees lot of space in fixmap and also makes maximum supported
device tree size supported as PGDIR_SIZE. Thus, init memory section can be used
for the same purpose as well. This simplifies fixmap implementation.
