net: hns3: batch tx doorbell operation

Use netdev_xmit_more() to defer the tx doorbell operation when
the skb is passed to the driver continuously. By doing this we
can improve the overall xmit performance by avoid some doorbell
operations.

Also, the tx_err_cnt stat is not used, so rename it to tx_more
stat.
