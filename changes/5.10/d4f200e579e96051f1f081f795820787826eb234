lockdep/selftest: Add a R-L/L-W test case specific to chain cache behavior

As our chain cache doesn't differ read/write locks, so even we can
detect a read-lock/lock-write deadlock in check_noncircular(), we can
still be fooled if a read-lock/lock-read case(which is not a deadlock)
comes first.

So introduce this test case to test specific to the chain cache behavior
on detecting recursive read lock related deadlocks.
