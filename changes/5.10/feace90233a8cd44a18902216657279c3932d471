spi: rspi: Increase bit rate accuracy on RZ/A

rspi_rz_set_config_register() favors high values of "brdv" over high
values of "spbr".  As "brdv" is not a plain divider, but controls a
power-of-two divider, this may cause the selection of non-optimal
divider values.  E.g. on RSK+RZA1, when 3.8 MHz is requested, the actual
configured bit rate is 2.08 MHz (spbr = 1, brdv = 3), while 3.7 MHz
would be possible (spbr = 8, brdv = 0).

Fix this by only resorting to higher "brdv" values when really needed.
This makes the driver always pick optimal divider values on RZ/A.
