rtc: ds1307: apply DS13XX_TRICKLE_CHARGER_MAGIC only conditionally

DS13XX_TRICKLE_CHARGER_MAGIC sets the trickle-charge select (TCS) bits
(7..4). The datasheet of Maxim Integrated's DS1339 [1] for instance
reads:

"To prevent accidental enabling, only a pattern on 1010 enables the
trickle charger. All other patterns disable the trickle charger."

Since not all RTCs connected to a backup battery or supercap use these
bits DS13XX_TRICKLE_CHARGER_MAGIC should not get applied for all charger
setups unconditionally.
Epson's RX8130 is such an example: Instead of TCS bits "SMPTSEL1",
"SMPTSEL0",  "CHGEN" and "INIEN" are expected as bit 7..4.

DS1339 and DS1340 are currently the only RTCs in the ds1307 driver that
apply DS13XX_TRICKLE_CHARGER_MAGIC to their setup register value. So
apply DS13XX_TRICKLE_CHARGER_MAGIC in do_trickle_setup_ds1339() which
is used by both RTCs.
