powerpc/smp: Optimize remove_cpu_from_masks

While offlining a CPU, system currently iterate through all the CPUs in
the DIE to clear sibling, l2_cache and smallcore maps. However if there
are more cores in a DIE, system can end up spending more time iterating
through CPUs which are completely unrelated.

Optimize this by only iterating through smaller but relevant cpumap.
If shared_cache is set, cpu_l2_cache_map should be relevant else
cpu_sibling_map would be relevant.
