fs: Add standard casefolding support

This adds general supporting functions for filesystems that use
utf8 casefolding. It provides standard dentry_operations and adds the
necessary structures in struct super_block to allow this standardization.

The new dentry operations are functionally equivalent to the existing
operations in ext4 and f2fs, apart from the use of utf8_casefold_hash to
avoid an allocation.

By providing a common implementation, all users can benefit from any
optimizations without needing to port over improvements.
