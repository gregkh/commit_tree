arm64: dts: arm: Fix SP805 clock-names

The SP805 binding sets the name for the actual watchdog clock to
"wdog_clk" (with an underscore).

Change the name in the DTs for ARM Ltd. platforms to match that. The
Linux and U-Boot driver use the *first* clock for this purpose anyway,
so it does not break anything.
