USB: hub: Clean up use of port initialization schemes and retries

The SET_CONFIG_TRIES macro in hub.c is badly named; it controls the
number of port-initialization retry attempts rather than the number of
Set-Configuration attempts.  Furthermore, the USE_NEW_SCHEME macro and
use_new_scheme() function are written in a very confusing manner,
making it almost impossible to figure out exactly what they do or
check that they are correct.

This patch renames SET_CONFIG_TRIES to PORT_INIT_TRIES, removes
USE_NEW_SCHEME entirely, and rewrites use_new_scheme() to be much more
transparent, with added comments explaining how it works.  The patch
also pulls the single call site of use_new_scheme() out from the
Get-Descriptor retry loop (where it returns the same value each time)
and renames the local variable used to store the result.

The overall effect is a minor cleanup.  However, there is one
functional change: If the "use_both_schemes" module parameter isn't
set (by default it is set), the existing code does only two retry
iterations.  After this patch it will always perform four, regardless
of the parameter's value.
