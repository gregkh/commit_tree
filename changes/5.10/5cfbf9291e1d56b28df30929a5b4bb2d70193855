RDMA/cma: Remove cma_comp()

The only place that still uses it is rdma_join_multicast() which is only
doing a sanity check that the caller hasn't done something wrong and
doesn't need the spinlock.

At least in the case of rdma_join_multicast() the information it needs
will remain until the ID is destroyed once it enters these
states. Similarly there is no reason to check for these specific states in
the handler callback, instead use the usual check for a destroyed id under
the handler_mutex.
