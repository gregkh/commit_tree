x86/boot/compressed/64: Add set_page_en/decrypted() helpers

The functions are needed to map the GHCB for SEV-ES guests. The GHCB
is used for communication with the hypervisor, so its content must not
be encrypted. After the GHCB is not needed anymore it must be mapped
encrypted again so that the running kernel image can safely re-use the
memory.
