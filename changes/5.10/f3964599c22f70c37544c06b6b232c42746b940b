mm/gup_benchmark: take the mmap lock around GUP

To be safe against concurrent changes to the VMA tree, we must take the
mmap lock around GUP operations (excluding the GUP-fast family of
operations, which will take the mmap lock by themselves if necessary).

This code is only for testing, and it's only reachable by root through
debugfs, so this doesn't really have any impact; however, if we want to
add lockdep asserts into the GUP path, we need to have clean locking here.
