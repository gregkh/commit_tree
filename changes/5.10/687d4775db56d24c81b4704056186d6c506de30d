torture: Declare parse-console.sh independence from rcutorture

Currently, parse-torture.sh looks at the fifth field of torture-test
console output for the version number.  This works fine for rcutorture,
but not for scftorture, which lacks the pointer field.  This commit
therefore adjusts matching lines so that the parse-console.sh awk script
always sees the version number as the first field in the lines passed
to it.
