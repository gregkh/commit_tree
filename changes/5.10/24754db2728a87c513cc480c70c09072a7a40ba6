fuse: store fuse_conn in fuse_req

Every fuse_req belongs to a fuse_conn.  Right now, we always know which
fuse_conn that is based on the respective device, but we want to allow
multiple (sub)mounts per single connection, and then the corresponding
filesystem is not going to be so trivial to obtain.

Storing a pointer to the associated fuse_conn in every fuse_req will
allow us to trivially find any request's superblock (and thus
filesystem) even then.
