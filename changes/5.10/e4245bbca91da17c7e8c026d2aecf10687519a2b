dt-bindings: can: flexcan: remove ack_grp and ack_bit from fsl,stop-mode

Since commit:

    048e3a34a2e7 can: flexcan: poll MCR_LPM_ACK instead of GPR ACK for stop mode acknowledgment

the driver polls the IP core's internal bit MCR[LPM_ACK] as stop mode
acknowledge and not the acknowledgment on chip level.

This means the 4th and 5th value of the property "fsl,stop-mode" isn't used
anymore. It will be removed from the driver in the next patch, so remove it
from the binding documentation.
