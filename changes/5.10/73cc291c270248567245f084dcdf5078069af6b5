scsi: ufs: Make sure clk scaling happens only when HBA is runtime ACTIVE

If someone plays with the UFS clk scaling devfreq governor through sysfs,
ufshcd_devfreq_scale may be called even when HBA is not runtime ACTIVE.
This can lead to unexpected error. We cannot just protect it by calling
pm_runtime_get_sync() because that may cause a race condition since HBA
runtime suspend ops need to suspend clk scaling. To fix this call
pm_runtime_get_noresume() and check HBA's runtime status. Only proceed if
HBA is runtime ACTIVE, otherwise just bail.
