HID: Add Logitech Dinovo Edge battery quirk

The battery status is also being reported by the logitech-hidpp driver,
so ignore the standard HID battery status to avoid reporting the same
info twice.

Note the logitech-hidpp battery driver provides more info, such as properly
differentiating between charging and discharging. Also the standard HID
battery info seems to be wrong, reporting a capacity of just 26% after
fully charging the device.
