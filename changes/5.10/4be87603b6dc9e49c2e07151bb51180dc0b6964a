serial: mcf: add sysrq capability

After some unsuccessful attempts to use sysrq over console, figured
out that port->has_sysrq should likely be enabled, as per other
architectures, this when CONFIG_SERIAL_MCF_CONSOLE is also enabled.

Tested some magic sysrq commands (h, p, t, b), they works now
properly. Commands works inside 5 secs after BREAK is sent, as
expected.
