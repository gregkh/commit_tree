ovl: rearrange ovl_can_list()

ovl_can_list() should return false for overlay private xattrs.  Since
currently these use the "trusted.overlay." prefix, they will always match
the "trusted." prefix as well, hence the test for being non-trusted will
not trigger.

Prepare for using the "user.overlay." namespace by moving the test for
private xattr before the test for non-trusted.

This patch doesn't change behavior.
