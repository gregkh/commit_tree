ALSA: usb-audio: Move device rename and profile quirks to an internal table

So far we've added the devices that need vendor/product string renames
or the profile setup into the standard quirk table in quirks-table.h.
This table is imported into the primary USB audio device entry, hence
it's all exported for the probing so that udev and co can take a look
at it.  OTOH, for renaming or profile setup, we don't need to expose
those explicit entries because the probe itself follows the standard
way.  That said, we're exposing unnecessarily too many entries.

This patch moves such internal quirk entries into the own table, and
reduces the exported device table size.  Along with the moving items,
re-arrange the entries in the proper order.
