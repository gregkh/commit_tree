Revert "scsi: storvsc: Validate length of incoming packet in storvsc_on_channel_callback()"

This reverts commit 3b8c72d076c42bf27284cda7b2b2b522810686f8.

Dexuan reported a regression where StorVSC fails to probe a device (and
where, consequently, the VM may fail to boot).  The root-cause analysis led
to a long-standing race condition that is exposed by the validation /commit
in question.  Let's put the new validation aside until a proper solution
for that race condition is in place.
