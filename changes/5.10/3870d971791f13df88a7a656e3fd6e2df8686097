x86/kaslr: Drop test for command-line parameters before parsing

This check doesn't save anything. In the case when none of the
parameters are present, each strstr will scan args twice (once to find
the length and then for searching), six scans in total. Just going ahead
and parsing the arguments only requires three scans: strlen, memcpy, and
parsing. This will be the first malloc, so free will actually free up
the memory, so the check doesn't save heap space either.
