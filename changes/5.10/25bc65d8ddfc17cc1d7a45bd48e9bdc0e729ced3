x86/mce: Do not overwrite no_way_out if mce_end() fails

Currently, if mce_end() fails, no_way_out - the variable denoting
whether the machine can recover from this MCE - is determined by whether
the worst severity that was found across the MCA banks associated with
the current CPU, is of panic severity.

However, at this point no_way_out could have been already set by
mca_start() after looking at all severities of all CPUs that entered the
MCE handler. If mce_end() fails, check first if no_way_out is already
set and, if so, stick to it, otherwise use the local worst value.
