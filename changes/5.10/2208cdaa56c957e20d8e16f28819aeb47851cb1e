sched/fair: Reduce minimal imbalance threshold

The 25% default imbalance threshold for DIE and NUMA domain is large
enough to generate significant unfairness between threads. A typical
example is the case of 11 threads running on 2x4 CPUs. The imbalance of
20% between the 2 groups of 4 cores is just low enough to not trigger
the load balance between the 2 groups. We will have always the same 6
threads on one group of 4 CPUs and the other 5 threads on the other
group of CPUS. With a fair time sharing in each group, we ends up with
+20% running time for the group of 5 threads.

Consider decreasing the imbalance threshold for overloaded case where we
use the load to balance task and to ensure fair time sharing.
