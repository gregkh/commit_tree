btrfs: send: get rid of i_size logic in send_write()

send_write()/fill_read_buf() have some logic for avoiding reading past
i_size. However, everywhere that we call
send_write()/send_extent_data(), we've already clamped the length down
to i_size. Get rid of the i_size handling, which simplifies the next
change.
