drm/i915/display: Ensure that ret is always initialized in icl_combo_phy_verify_state

Clang warns:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_combo_phy.c:268:3: warning: variable
'ret' is uninitialized when used here [-Wuninitialized]
                ret &= check_phy_reg(dev_priv, phy, ICL_PORT_TX_DW8_LN0(phy),
                ^~~
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_combo_phy.c:261:10: note: initialize
the variable 'ret' to silence this warning
        bool ret;
                ^
                 = 0
1 warning generated.

In practice, the bug this warning appears to be concerned with would not
actually matter because ret gets initialized to the return value of
cnl_verify_procmon_ref_values. However, that does appear to be a bug
since it means the first hunk of the patch this fixes won't actually do
anything (since the values of check_phy_reg won't factor into the final
ret value). Initialize ret to true then make all of the assignments a
bitwise AND with itself so that the function always does what it should
do.
