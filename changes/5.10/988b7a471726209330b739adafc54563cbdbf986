nitro_enclaves: Add logic for getting the enclave image load info

Before setting the memory regions for the enclave, the enclave image
needs to be placed in memory. After the memory regions are set, this
memory cannot be used anymore by the VM, being carved out.

Add ioctl command logic to get the offset in enclave memory where to
place the enclave image. Then the user space tooling copies the enclave
image in the memory using the given memory offset.
