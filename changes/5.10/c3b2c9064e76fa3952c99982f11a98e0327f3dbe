s390/pci: remove clp_rescan_pci_devices_simple()

clp_rescan_pci_devices_simple() is neither simpler than
clp_scan_pci_devices() nor does it really scan PCI devices, in particular
it will neither add newly discovered devices nor remove those which
disappeared.
Instead it only refreshes PCI function handles and also
has just a single callsite in the same translation unit left which
in fact only refreshes one specific function handle identified by
a FID.

Clarify this by renaming the function and its helper to
clp_refresh_fh() respectvely __clp_refresh_fh() and make it take
a fid directly which saves us dealing with the NULL case which
updated all function handles but is not used anymore.
Furthermore since the only callsite is in the same translation unit
make it static.
