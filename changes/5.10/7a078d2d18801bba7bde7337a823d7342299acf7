libbpf, hashmap: Fix undefined behavior in hash_bits

If bits is 0, the case when the map is empty, then the >> is the size of
the register which is undefined behavior - on x86 it is the same as a
shift by 0.

Fix by handling the 0 case explicitly and guarding calls to hash_bits for
empty maps in hashmap__for_each_key_entry and hashmap__for_each_entry_safe.
