fbdev: via-core: use generic power management

Drivers should do only device-specific jobs. But in general, drivers using
legacy PCI PM framework for .suspend()/.resume() have to manage many PCI
PM-related tasks themselves which can be done by PCI Core itself. This
brings extra load on the driver and it directly calls PCI helper functions
to handle them.

Switch to the new generic framework by updating function signatures and
define a "struct dev_pm_ops" variable to bind PM callbacks.

The via_suspend() is designed to function only in the case of Suspend.
Thus, the code checked for "if (state.event != PM_EVENT_SUSPEND)". This is
because, in the legacy framework, this callback was invoked even in the
event of Freeze and Hibernate. Hence, added the load of unnecessary
function-calls.

The goal can be achieved by binding the callback with only
"via_pm_ops.suspend" in the new framework. This also avoids the step of
checking "if (state.event != PM_EVENT_SUSPEND)" every time the callback is
invoked.
