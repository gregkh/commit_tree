l2tp: capture more tx errors in data plane stats

l2tp_xmit_skb has a number of failure paths which are not reflected in
the tunnel and session statistics because the stats are updated by
l2tp_xmit_core.  Hence any errors occurring before l2tp_xmit_core is
called are missed from the statistics.

Refactor the transmit path slightly to capture all error paths.

l2tp_xmit_skb now leaves all the actual work of transmission to
l2tp_xmit_core, and updates the statistics based on l2tp_xmit_core's
return code.
