btrfs: send: avoid copying file data

send_write() currently copies from the page cache to sctx->read_buf, and
then from sctx->read_buf to sctx->send_buf. Similarly, send_hole()
zeroes sctx->read_buf and then copies from sctx->read_buf to
sctx->send_buf. However, if we write the TLV header manually, we can
copy to sctx->send_buf directly and get rid of sctx->read_buf.
