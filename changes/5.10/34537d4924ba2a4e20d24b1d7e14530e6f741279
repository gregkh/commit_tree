hostap: Mark 'freq_list' as __maybe_unused

'freq_list' is used in some source files which include hostap.h, but
not all.  The compiler complains about the times it's not used.  Mark
it as __maybe_used to tell the compiler that this is not only okay,
it's expected.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):
