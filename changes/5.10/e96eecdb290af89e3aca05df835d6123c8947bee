ath10k: wmi: Use struct_size() helper in ath10k_wmi_alloc_skb()

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes. Also, remove unnecessary
variable _len_.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle and, audited and
fixed manually.
