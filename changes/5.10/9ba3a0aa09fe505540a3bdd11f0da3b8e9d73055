fpga: dfl: create a dfl bus type to support DFL devices

A new bus type "dfl" is introduced for private features which are not
initialized by DFL feature drivers (dfl-fme & dfl-afu drivers). So these
private features could be handled by separate driver modules.

DFL feature drivers (dfl-fme, dfl-port) will create DFL devices on
enumeration. DFL drivers could be registered on this bus to match these
DFL devices. They are matched by dfl type & feature_id.
