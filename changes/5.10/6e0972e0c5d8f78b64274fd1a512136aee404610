selftests: forwarding: devlink_lib: Split devlink_..._set() into save & set

Changing pool type from static to dynamic causes reinterpretation of
threshold values. They therefore need to be saved before pool type is
changed, then the pool type can be changed, and then the new values need
to be set up.

For that reason, set cannot subsume save, because it would be saving the
wrong thing, with possibly a nonsensical value, and restore would then fail
to restore the nonsensical value.

Thus extract a _save() from each of the relevant _set()'s. This way it is
possible to save everything up front, then to tweak it, and then restore in
the required order.
