selftest/bpf: Test bpf_probe_read_user_str() strips trailing bytes after NUL

Previously, bpf_probe_read_user_str() could potentially overcopy the
trailing bytes after the NUL due to how do_strncpy_from_user() does the
copy in long-sized strides. The issue has been fixed in the previous
commit.

This commit adds a selftest that ensures we don't regress
bpf_probe_read_user_str() again.
