media: vidtv: remove a wrong endiannes check from s302m generator

The code there is already doing the right thing, as it uses
value & 0xff, value & 0xff00, which already ensures the
expected endiannes.

So, it doesn't make any sense to touch the order depending on
the CPU endiannes.

Yet, as pointed by Daniel at the mailing list:
	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/e614351c-215c-c048-52af-7c200b164f41@xs4all.nl/T/#m8d221684a151833966359c2ed8bdce0f0ee4e5fd

The reverse code is needed by the decoder. So, keep it
no matter the endiannes.
