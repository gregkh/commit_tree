fs: don't allow kernel reads and writes without iter ops

Don't allow calling ->read or ->write with set_fs as a preparation for
killing off set_fs.  All the instances that we use kernel_read/write on
are using the iter ops already.

If a file has both the regular ->read/->write methods and the iter
variants those could have different semantics for messed up enough
drivers.  Also fails the kernel access to them in that case.
