net: hns3: add support to query device specifications

To improve code maintainability and compatibility, new commands
HCLGE_OPC_QUERY_DEV_SPECS for PF and HCLGEVF_OPC_QUERY_DEV_SPECS
for VF are introduced to query device specifications, instead of
statically defining specifications by checking the hardware version
or other methods.
