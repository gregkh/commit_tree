vdpasim: fix MAC address configuration

vdpa_sim generates a ramdom MAC address but it is never used by upper
layers because the VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC bit is not set in the features list.

Because of that, virtio-net always regenerates a random MAC address each
time it is loaded whereas the address should only change on vdpa_sim
load/unload.

Fix that by adding VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC in the features list of vdpa_sim.
