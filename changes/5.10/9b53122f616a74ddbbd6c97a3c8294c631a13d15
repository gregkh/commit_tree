lib/test_hmm.c: remove unused dmirror_zero_page

The variable dmirror_zero_page is unused in the HMM self test driver which
was probably intended to demonstrate how a driver could use
migrate_vma_setup() to share a single read-only device private zero page
similar to how the CPU does.  However, this isn't needed for the self
tests so remove it.
