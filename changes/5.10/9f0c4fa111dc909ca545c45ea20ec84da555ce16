perf/core: Add a new PERF_EV_CAP_SIBLING event capability

Current perf assumes that events in a group are independent. Close an
event doesn't impact the value of the other events in the same group.
If the closed event is a member, after the event closure, other events
are still running like a group. If the closed event is a leader, other
events are running as singleton events.

Add PERF_EV_CAP_SIBLING to allow events to indicate they require being
part of a group, and when the leader dies they cannot exist
independently.
