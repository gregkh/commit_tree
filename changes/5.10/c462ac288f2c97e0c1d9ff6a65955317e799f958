mm: Introduce arch_validate_flags()

Similarly to arch_validate_prot() called from do_mprotect_pkey(), an
architecture may need to sanity-check the new vm_flags.

Define a dummy function always returning true. In addition to
do_mprotect_pkey(), also invoke it from mmap_region() prior to updating
vma->vm_page_prot to allow the architecture code to veto potentially
inconsistent vm_flags.
