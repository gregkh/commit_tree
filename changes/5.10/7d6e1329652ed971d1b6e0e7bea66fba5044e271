vfio iommu: Add dma available capability

Commit 492855939bdb ("vfio/type1: Limit DMA mappings per container")
added the ability to limit the number of memory backed DMA mappings.
However on s390x, when lazy mapping is in use, we use a very large
number of concurrent mappings.  Let's provide the current allowable
number of DMA mappings to userspace via the IOMMU info chain so that
userspace can take appropriate mitigation.
