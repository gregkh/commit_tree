spi: dw: Add KeemBay Master capability

In a further commit we'll have to get rid of the update_cr0() callback and
define a DW SSI capability instead. Since Keem Bay master/slave
functionality is controller by the CTRL0 register bitfield, we need to
first move the master mode selection into the internal corresponding
update_cr0 method, which would be activated by means of the dedicated
DW_SPI_CAP_KEEMBAY_MST capability setup.

Note this will be also useful if the driver will be ever altered to
support the DW SPI slave interface.
