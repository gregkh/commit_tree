binder: Remove bogus warning on failed same-process transaction

While binder transactions with the same binder_proc as sender and recipient
are forbidden, transactions with the same task_struct as sender and
recipient are possible (even though currently there is a weird check in
binder_transaction() that rejects them in the target==0 case).
Therefore, task_struct identities can't be used to distinguish whether
the caller is running in the context of the sender or the recipient.

Since I see no easy way to make this WARN_ON() useful and correct, let's
just remove it.
