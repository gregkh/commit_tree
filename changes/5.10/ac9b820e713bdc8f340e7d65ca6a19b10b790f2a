nvme-fc: remove nvme_fc_terminate_io()

__nvme_fc_terminate_io() is now called by only 1 place, in reset_work.
Consoldate and move the functionality of terminate_io into reset_work.

In reset_work, rather than calling the create_association directly,
schedule the connect work element to do its thing. After scheduling,
flush the connect work element to continue with semantic of not
returning until connect has been attempted at least once.
