drm/vboxvideo: Use drm_gem_vram_vmap() interfaces

VRAM helpers support ref counting for pin and vmap operations, no need
to avoid these operations by employing the internal kmap interface. Just
use drm_gem_vram_vmap() and let it handle the details.

Also unexport the kmap interfaces from VRAM helpers. Vboxvideo was the
last user of these internal functions.

v2:
