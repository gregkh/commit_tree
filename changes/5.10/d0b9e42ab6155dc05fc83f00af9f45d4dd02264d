f2fs: introduce inmem curseg

Previous implementation of aligned pinfile allocation will:
- allocate new segment on cold data log no matter whether last used
segment is partially used or not, it makes IOs more random;
- force concurrent cold data/GCed IO going into warm data area, it
can make a bad effect on hot/cold data separation;

In this patch, we introduce a new type of log named 'inmem curseg',
the differents from normal curseg is:
- it reuses existed segment type (CURSEG_XXX_NODE/DATA);
- it only exists in memory, its segno, blkofs, summary will not b
 persisted into checkpoint area;

With this new feature, we can enhance scalability of log, special
allocators can be created for purposes:
- pure lfs allocator for aligned pinfile allocation or file
defragmentation
- pure ssr allocator for later feature

So that, let's update aligned pinfile allocation to use this new
inmem curseg fwk.
