btrfs: rename struct btrfs_clone_extent_info to a more generic name

Now that we can use btrfs_clone_extent_info to convey information for a
new prealloc extent as well, and not just for existing extents that are
being cloned, rename it to btrfs_replace_extent_info, which reflects the
fact that this is now more generic and it is used to replace all existing
extents in a file range with the extent described by the structure.
