samples, bpf: Replace bpf_program__title() with bpf_program__section_name()

From commit 521095842027 ("libbpf: Deprecate notion of BPF program
"title" in favor of "section name""), the term title has been replaced
with section name in libbpf.

Since the bpf_program__title() has been deprecated, this commit
switches this function to bpf_program__section_name(). Due to
this commit, the compilation warning issue has also been resolved.
