usb: dwc2: Add missing cleanups when usb_add_gadget_udc() fails

Call dwc2_debugfs_exit() and dwc2_hcd_remove() (if the HCD was enabled
earlier) when usb_add_gadget_udc() has failed. This ensures that the
debugfs entries created by dwc2_debugfs_init() as well as the HCD are
cleaned up in the error path.
