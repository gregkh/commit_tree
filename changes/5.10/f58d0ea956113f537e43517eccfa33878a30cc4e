xfs: refactor xfs_buf_ioerror_fail_without_retry

xfs_buf_ioerror_fail_without_retry is a somewhat weird function in
that it has two trivial checks that decide the return value, while
the rest implements a ratelimited warning.  Just lift the two checks
into the caller, and give the remainder a suitable name.
