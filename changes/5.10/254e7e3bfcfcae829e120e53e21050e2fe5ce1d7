drm/nouveau/kms: Don't clear DP_MST_CTRL DPCD in nv50_mstm_new()

Since commit fa3cdf8d0b09 ("drm/nouveau: Reset MST branching unit before
enabling") we've been clearing DP_MST_CTRL before we start enabling MST.
Since then clearing DP_MST_CTRL in nv50_mstm_new() has been unnecessary
and redundant, so let's remove it.
