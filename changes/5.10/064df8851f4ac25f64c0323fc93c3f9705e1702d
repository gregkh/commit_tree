cros_ec_lightbar: Accept more error codes from cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status

Since commit c5cd2b47b203 ("platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: Report command
not supported") we can no longer assume that cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status()
reports -EPROTO for all errors returned by the EC itself. A follow-up
patch will change cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status() to report additional errors
reported by the EC as distinguished Linux error codes.

Handle this change by no longer assuming that -EPROTO is used to report
all errors returned by the EC itself. Since errors reported by the EC are
already reported in text form through sysfs attributes, extend this form
of error reporting to all errors reported by cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status().
