soc: ti: k3: ringacc: add am65x sr2.0 support

The AM65x SR2.0 Ringacc has fixed errata i2023 "RINGACC, UDMA: RINGACC and
UDMA Ring State Interoperability Issue after Channel Teardown". This errata
also fixed for J271E SoC.

Use SOC bus data for K3 SoC identification and enable i2023 errate w/a only
for the AM65x SR1.0. This also makes obsolete "ti,dma-ring-reset-quirk" DT
property.
