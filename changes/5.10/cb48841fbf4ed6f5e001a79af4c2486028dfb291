mm/mmap.c: use helper function allow_write_access() in __remove_shared_vm_struct()

In commit 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2"), the helper allow_write_access
came with the atomic_inc operation of the i_writecount field in the func
__remove_shared_vm_struct().  But it forgot to use this helper function.
