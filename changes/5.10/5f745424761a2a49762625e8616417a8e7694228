usb: gadget: s3c-hsudc: remove platform header dependency

There is no real phy driver, so s3c-hsudc just pokes the registers
itself. Improve this a little by making it a platform data callback
like we do for gpios.

There is only one board using this driver, and it's unlikely
that another would be added, so this is a minimal workaround.
