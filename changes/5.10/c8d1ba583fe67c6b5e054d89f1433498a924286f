io_uring: split work handling part of SQPOLL into helper

This is done in preparation for handling more than one ctx, but it also
cleans up the code a bit since io_sq_thread() was a bit too unwieldy to
get a get overview on.

__io_sq_thread() is now the main handler, and it returns an enum sq_ret
that tells io_sq_thread() what it ended up doing. The parent then makes
a decision on idle, spinning, or work handling based on that.
