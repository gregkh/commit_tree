RDMA/mlx5: Don't call to restrack recursively

The restrack is going to manage memory of all IB objects and must be
called before object is created. GSI QP in the mlx5_ib separated between
creating dummy interface and HW object beneath. This was achieved by
double call to ib_create_qp().

In order to skip such reentry call to internal driver create_qp code.
