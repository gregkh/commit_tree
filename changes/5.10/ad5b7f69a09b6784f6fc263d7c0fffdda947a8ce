ASoC: sun50i-codec-analog: Fix duplicate use of ADC enable bits

The same enable bits are currently used for both the "Left/Right ADC"
and the "Left/Right ADC Mixer" widgets. This happens to work in practice
because the widgets are always enabled/disabled at the same time, but
each register bit should only be associated with a single widget.

To keep symmetry with the DAC widgets, keep the bits on the ADC widgets,
and remove them from the ADC Mixer widgets.
