i2c: mlxbf: Remove unecessary wrapper functions

Few wrapper functions are useless and can be inlined. So
delete mlxbf_i2c_read() and mlxbf_i2c_write() and replace
them with readl() and writel(), respectively. Also delete
mlxbf_i2c_read_data() and mlxbf_i2c_write() and replace
them with ioread32be() and iowrite32be(), respectively.
