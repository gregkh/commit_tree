scsi: hisi_sas: Add check for methods _PS0 and _PR0

To support system suspend/resume or runtime suspend/resume, need to use the
function pci_set_power_state() to change the power state which requires at
least method _PS0 or _PR0 be filled by platform for v3 hw. So check whether
the method is supported, if not, print a warning.

A Kconfig dependency is added as there is no stub for
acpi_device_power_manageable().
