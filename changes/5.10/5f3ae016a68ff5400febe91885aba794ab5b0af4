Docs: Fixing spelling errors in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/

Revised patch fixing six spelling errors within
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/. "specfied" replaced with "specified"
in all three files modified. "atleast" seperated into "at least" three
times in samsung-pinctrl.txt. This should remove any confusion that a
reader might have.
