nitro_enclaves: Init misc device providing the ioctl interface

The Nitro Enclaves driver provides an ioctl interface to the user space
for enclave lifetime management e.g. enclave creation / termination and
setting enclave resources such as memory and CPU.

This ioctl interface is mapped to a Nitro Enclaves misc device.

Changelog

v9 -> v10

* Update commit message to include the changelog before the SoB tag(s).

v8 -> v9

* Use the ne_devs data structure to get the refs for the NE misc device
  in the NE PCI device driver logic.

v7 -> v8

* Add define for the CID of the primary / parent VM.
* Update the NE PCI driver shutdown logic to include misc device
  deregister.

v6 -> v7

* Set the NE PCI device the parent of the NE misc device to be able to
  use it in the ioctl logic.
* Update the naming and add more comments to make more clear the logic
  of handling full CPU cores and dedicating them to the enclave.

v5 -> v6

* Remove the ioctl to query API version.
* Update documentation to kernel-doc format.

v4 -> v5

* Update the size of the NE CPU pool string from 4096 to 512 chars.

v3 -> v4

* Use dev_err instead of custom NE log pattern.
* Remove the NE CPU pool init during kernel module loading, as the CPU
  pool is now setup at runtime, via a sysfs file for the kernel
  parameter.
* Add minimum enclave memory size definition.

v2 -> v3

* Remove the GPL additional wording as SPDX-License-Identifier is
  already in place.
* Remove the WARN_ON calls.
* Remove linux/bug and linux/kvm_host includes that are not needed.
* Remove "ratelimited" from the logs that are not in the ioctl call
  paths.
* Remove file ops that do nothing for now - open and release.

v1 -> v2

* Add log pattern for NE.
* Update goto labels to match their purpose.
* Update ne_cpu_pool data structure to include the global mutex.
* Update NE misc device mode to 0660.
* Check if the CPU siblings are included in the NE CPU pool, as full CPU
  cores are given for the enclave(s).
