docs: net: statistics.rst: remove a duplicated kernel-doc

include/linux/ethtool.h is included twice with kernel-doc,
both to document ethtool_pause_stats(). The first one is
at statistics.rst, and the second one at ethtool-netlink.rst.

Replace one of the references to use the name of the
function. The automarkup.py extension should create the
cross-references.

Solves this warning:

	../Documentation/networking/ethtool-netlink.rst: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined in 'networking/statistics'.
	Declaration is 'ethtool_pause_stats'.
