ASoC: SOF: topology: fix core enable sequence

Core power up involves 2 steps: The first step tries to
power up the core by setting the ADSPCS.SPA bit for the host-managed
cores. The second step involves sending the IPC to power up other
cores that are not host managed. The enabled_cores_mask should
be updated only when both these steps are successful. If the
IPC to the DSP fails, the host-managed core that was powered in
step 1 should be powered off before returning the error.
