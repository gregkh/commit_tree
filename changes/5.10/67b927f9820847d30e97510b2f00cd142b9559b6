ath10k: fix retry packets update in station dump

When tx status enabled, retry count is updated from tx completion status.
which is not working as expected due to firmware limitation where
firmware can not provide per MSDU rate statistics from tx completion
status. Due to this tx retry count is always 0 in station dump.

Fix this issue by updating the retry packet count from per peer
statistics. This patch will not break on SDIO devices since, this retry
count is already updating from peer statistics for SDIO devices.
