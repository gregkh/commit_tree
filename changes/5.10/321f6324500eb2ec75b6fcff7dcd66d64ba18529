samples: bpf: Refactor XDP kern program maps with BTF-defined map

Most of the samples were converted to use the new BTF-defined MAP as
they moved to libbpf, but some of the samples were missing.

Instead of using the previous BPF MAP definition, this commit refactors
xdp_monitor and xdp_sample_pkts_kern MAP definition with the new
BTF-defined MAP format.

Also, this commit removes the max_entries attribute at PERF_EVENT_ARRAY
map type. The libbpf's bpf_object__create_map() will automatically
set max_entries to the maximum configured number of CPUs on the host.
