PCI: aardvark: Implement driver 'remove' function and allow to build it as module

Providing driver's 'remove' function allows kernel to bind and unbind devices
from aardvark driver. It also allows to build aardvark driver as a module.

Compiling aardvark as a module simplifies development and debugging of
this driver as it can be reloaded at runtime without the need to reboot
to new kernel.
