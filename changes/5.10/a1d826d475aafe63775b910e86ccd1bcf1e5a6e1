x86: make TASK_SIZE_MAX usable from assembly code

For 64-bit the only thing missing was a strategic _AC, and for 32-bit we
need to use __PAGE_OFFSET instead of PAGE_OFFSET in the TASK_SIZE
definition to escape the explicit unsigned long cast.  This just works
because __PAGE_OFFSET is defined using _AC itself and thus never needs
the cast anyway.
