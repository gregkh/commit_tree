perf c2c: Update usage for showing memory events

Since commit b027cc6fdf1b ("perf c2c: Fix 'perf c2c record -e list' to
show the default events used"), "perf c2c" tool can show the memory
events properly, it's no reason to still suggest user to use the
command "perf mem record -e list" for showing events.

This patch updates the usage for showing memory events with command
"perf c2c record -e list".
