io_uring: don't double complete failed reissue request

Zorro reports that an xfstest test case is failing, and it turns out that
for the reissue path we can potentially issue a double completion on the
request for the failure path. There's an issue around the retry as well,
but for now, at least just make sure that we handle the error path
correctly.
