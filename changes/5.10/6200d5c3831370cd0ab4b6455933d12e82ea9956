MAINTAINERS: Update XDP and AF_XDP entries

Getting too many false positive matches with current use
of the content regex K: and file regex N: patterns.

This patch drops file match N: and makes K: more restricted.
Some more normal F: file wildcards are added.

Notice that AF_XDP forgot to some F: files that is also
updated in this patch.
