l2tp: remove noisy logging, use appropriate log levels

l2tp_ppp in particular had a lot of log messages for tracing
[get|set]sockopt calls.  These aren't especially useful, so remove
these messages.

Several log messages flagging error conditions were logged using
l2tp_info: they're better off as l2tp_warn.
