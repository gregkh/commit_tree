IB/core: Enable ODP sync without faulting

Enable ODP sync without faulting, this improves performance by reducing
the number of page faults in the system.

The gain from this option is that the device page table can be aligned
with the presented pages in the CPU page table without causing page
faults.

As of that, the overhead on data path from hardware point of view to
trigger a fault which end-up by calling the driver to bring the pages
will be dropped.
