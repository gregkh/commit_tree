x86/boot: Check that there are no run-time relocations

Add a linker script check that there are no run-time relocations, and
remove the old one that tries to check via looking for specially-named
sections in the object files.

Drop the tests for -fPIE compiler option and -pie linker option, as they
are available in all supported gcc and binutils versions (as well as
clang and lld).
