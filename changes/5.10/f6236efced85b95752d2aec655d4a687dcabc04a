.gitignore: docs: ignore sphinx_*/ directories

The default way of building documentation is to use
Sphinx toolchain installed via pip, inside the
Kernel tree main directory. That's what's recommended by:

	scripts/sphinx-pre-install

As it usually provides a better version of this package
than the one installed, specially on LTS distros.

So, add the directories created by running the commands
suggested by the script.
