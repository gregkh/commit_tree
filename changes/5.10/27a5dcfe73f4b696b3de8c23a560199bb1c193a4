drm/i915/gem: Remove disordered per-file request list for throttling

I915_GEM_THROTTLE dates back to the time before contexts where there was
just a single engine, and therefore a single timeline and request list
globally. That request list was in execution/retirement order, and so
walking it to find a particular aged request made sense and could be
split per file.

That is no more. We now have many timelines with a file, as many as the
user wants to construct (essentially per-engine, per-context). Each of
those run independently and so make the single list futile. Remove the
disordered list, and iterate over all the timelines to find a request to
wait on in each to satisfy the criteria that the CPU is no more than 20ms
ahead of its oldest request.

It should go without saying that the I915_GEM_THROTTLE ioctl is no
longer used as the primary means of throttling, so it makes sense to push
the complication into the ioctl where it only impacts upon its few
irregular users, rather than the execbuf/retire where everybody has to
pay the cost. Fortunately, the few users do not create vast amount of
contexts, so the loops over contexts/engines should be concise.
