Fix compat regression in process_vm_rw()

The removal of compat_process_vm_{readv,writev} didn't change
process_vm_rw(), which always assumes it's not doing a compat syscall.

Instead of passing in 'false' unconditionally for 'compat', make it
conditional on in_compat_syscall().

[ Both Al and Christoph point out that trying to access a 64-bit process
  from a 32-bit one cannot work anyway, and is likely better prohibited,
  but that's a separate issue    - Linus ]
