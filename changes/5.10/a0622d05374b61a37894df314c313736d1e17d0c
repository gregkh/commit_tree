mm/page_alloc.c: clean code by merging two functions

finalise_ac() is just 'epilogue' for 'prepare_alloc_pages'.  Therefore
there is no need to keep them both so 'finalise_ac' content can be merged
into prepare_alloc_pages() code.  It would make __alloc_pages_nodemask()
cleaner when it comes to readability.
