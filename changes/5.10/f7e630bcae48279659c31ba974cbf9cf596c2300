ARM: dts: ZII: Disable HW Ethernet switch reset GPIOs

Disable Ethernet switch reset GPIO with ZII platforms that have it
enabled.  HW switch reset results in a reset of the copper PHYs
inside of the switch.  We want to avoid this reset of the copper PHYs
in the switch as this results in unnecessary broader network disruption on
a soft reboot of the application processor.

With the HW GPIO removed, the switch driver still performs a soft reset of
the switch core which has been shown to sufficiently meet our needs with
other ZII platforms that do not have the HW switch reset GPIO defined.
