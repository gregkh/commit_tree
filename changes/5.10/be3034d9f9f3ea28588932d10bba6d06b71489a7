spi: dw-dma: Check rx_buf availability in the xfer method

Checking rx_buf for being NULL and returning NULL from the Rx-channel
preparation method doesn't let us to distinguish that situation from
errors happening during the Rx SG-list preparation. So it's better to make
sure that the rx_buf not-NULL and full-duplex communication is requested
prior calling the Rx preparation method.
