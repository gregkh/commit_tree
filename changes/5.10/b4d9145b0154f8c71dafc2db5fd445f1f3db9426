drm/i915: Be wary of data races when reading the active execlists

To implement preempt-to-busy (and so efficient timeslicing and best utilization
of the hardware submission ports) we let the GPU run asynchronously in respect
to the ELSP submission queue. This created challenges in keeping and accessing
the driver state mirroring the asynchronous GPU execution.

The latest occurence of this was spotted by KCSAN:

[ 1413.563200] BUG: KCSAN: data-race in __await_execution+0x217/0x370 [i915]
[ 1413.563221]
[ 1413.563236] race at unknown origin, with read to 0xffff88885bb6c478 of 8 bytes by task 9654 on cpu 1:
[ 1413.563548]  __await_execution+0x217/0x370 [i915]

[ 1413.565094]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9

To complicate matters, we have to both avoid the read tearing of *active and
avoid any write tearing as perform the pending[] -> inflight[] promotion of the
execlists.

This is because we cannot rely on the memcpy doing u64 aligned copies on all
kernels/platforms and so we opt to open-code it with explicit WRITE_ONCE
annotations to satisfy KCSAN.

v2: When in doubt, write the same comment again.
v3: Expanded commit message.
