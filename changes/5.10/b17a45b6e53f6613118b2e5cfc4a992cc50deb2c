x86/boot/64: Explicitly map boot_params and command line

  8570978ea030 ("x86/boot/compressed/64: Don't pre-map memory in KASLR code")

set up a new page table in the decompressor stub, but without explicit
mappings for boot_params and the kernel command line, relying on the #PF
handler instead.

This is fragile, as boot_params and the command line mappings are
required for the main kernel. If EARLY_PRINTK and RANDOMIZE_BASE are
disabled, a QEMU/OVMF boot never accesses the command line in the
decompressor stub, and so it never gets mapped. The main kernel accesses
it from the identity mapping if AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT is enabled, and will
crash.

Fix this by adding back the explicit mapping of boot_params and the
command line.

Note: the changes also removed the explicit mapping of the main kernel,
with the result that .bss and .brk may not be in the identity mapping,
but those don't get accessed by the main kernel before it switches to
its own page tables.

 [ bp: Pass boot_params with a MOV %rsp... instead of PUSH/POP. Use
   block formatting for the comment. ]
