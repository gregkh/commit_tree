btrfs: change nr to u64 in btrfs_start_delalloc_roots

We have btrfs_wait_ordered_roots() which takes a u64 for nr, but
btrfs_start_delalloc_roots() that takes an int for nr, which makes using
them in conjunction, especially for something like (u64)-1, annoying and
inconsistent.  Fix btrfs_start_delalloc_roots() to take a u64 for nr and
adjust start_delalloc_inodes() and it's callers appropriately.

This means we've adjusted start_delalloc_inodes() to take a pointer of
nr since we want to preserve the ability for start-delalloc_inodes() to
return an error, so simply make it do the nr adjusting as necessary.

Part of adjusting the callers to this means changing
btrfs_writeback_inodes_sb_nr() to take a u64 for items.  This may be
confusing because it seems unrelated, but the caller of
btrfs_writeback_inodes_sb_nr() already passes in a u64, it's just the
function variable that needs to be changed.
