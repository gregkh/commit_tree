irqchip/mst: MST_IRQ should depend on ARCH_MEDIATEK or ARCH_MSTARV7

The MStar interrupt controller is only found on MStar, SigmaStar, and
Mediatek SoCs.  Hence add dependencies on ARCH_MEDIATEK and
ARCH_MSTARV7, to prevent asking the user about the MStar interrupt
controller driver when configuring a kernel without support for MStar,
SigmaStar, and Mediatek SoCs.
