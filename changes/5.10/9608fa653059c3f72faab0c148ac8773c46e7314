net/sched: act_mpls: ensure LSE is pullable before reading it

when 'act_mpls' is used to mangle the LSE, the current value is read from
the packet dereferencing 4 bytes at mpls_hdr(): ensure that the label is
contained in the skb "linear" area.

Found by code inspection.

v2:
 - use MPLS_HLEN instead of sizeof(new_lse), thanks to Jakub Kicinski
