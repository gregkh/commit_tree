memory: brcmstb_dpfe: fix array index out of bounds

We would overrun the error_text array if we hit a TIMEOUT condition,
because we were using the error code "ETIMEDOUT" (which is 110) as an
array index.

We fix the problem by correcting the array index and by providing a
function to retrieve error messages rather than accessing the array
directly. The function includes a bounds check that prevents the array
from being overrun.
