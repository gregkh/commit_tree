btrfs: make ALLOC_CHUNK use the space info flags

We have traditionally used flush_space() to flush metadata space, so
we've been unconditionally using btrfs_metadata_alloc_profile() for our
profile to allocate a chunk. However if we're going to use this for
data we need to use btrfs_get_alloc_profile() on the space_info we pass
in.
