fs: add a filesystem flag for THPs

The page cache needs to know whether the filesystem supports THPs so that
it doesn't send THPs to filesystems which can't handle them.  Dave Chinner
points out that getting from the page mapping to the filesystem type is
too many steps (mapping->host->i_sb->s_type->fs_flags) so cache that
information in the address space flags.
