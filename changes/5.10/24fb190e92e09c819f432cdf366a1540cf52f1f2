media: vidtv: implement a tuner driver

The virtual DVB test driver serves as a reference DVB driver and helps
validate the existing APIs in the media subsystem. It can also aid
developers working on userspace applications.

This dummy tuner should support common TV standards such as DVB-T/T2/S/S2,
ISDB-T and ATSC when completed.
