batman-adv: Reserve needed_*room for fragments

The batadv net_device is trying to propagate the needed_headroom and
needed_tailroom from the lower devices. This is needed to avoid cost
intensive reallocations using pskb_expand_head during the transmission.

But the fragmentation code split the skb's without adding extra room at the
end/beginning of the various fragments. This reduced the performance of
transmissions over complex scenarios (batadv on vxlan on wireguard) because
the lower devices had to perform the reallocations at least once.
