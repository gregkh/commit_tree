KVM: arm64: Fix build error in user_mem_abort()

The PUD and PMD are folded into PGD when the following options are
enabled. In that case, PUD_SHIFT is equal to PMD_SHIFT and we fail
to build with the indicated errors:

   CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS_42=y
   CONFIG_ARM64_PAGE_SHIFT=16
   CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS=3

   arch/arm64/kvm/mmu.c: In function ‘user_mem_abort’:
   arch/arm64/kvm/mmu.c:798:2: error: duplicate case value
     case PMD_SHIFT:
     ^~~~
   arch/arm64/kvm/mmu.c:791:2: note: previously used here
     case PUD_SHIFT:
     ^~~~

This fixes the issue by skipping the check on PUD huge page when PUD
and PMD are folded into PGD.
