slimbus: core: check get_addr before removing laddr ida

logical address can be either assigned by the SLIMBus controller or the core.
Core uses IDA in cases where get_addr callback is not provided by the
controller.
Core already has this check while allocating IDR, however during absence
reporting this is not checked. This patch fixes this issue.
