mm/memremap.c: convert devmap static branch to {inc,dec}

While reviewing Protection Key Supervisor support it was pointed out that
using a counter to track static branch enable was an anti-pattern which
was better solved using the provided static_branch_{inc,dec} functions.[1]

Fix up devmap_managed_key to work the same way.  Also this should be safer
because there is a very small (very unlikely) race when multiple callers
try to enable at the same time.
