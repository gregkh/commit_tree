USB: apple-mfi-fastcharge: don't probe unhandled devices

From: Bastien Nocera <hadess@hadess.net>

Contrary to the comment above the id table, we didn't implement a match
function. This meant that every single Apple device that was already
plugged in to the computer would have its device driver reprobed
when the apple-mfi-fastcharge driver was loaded, eg. the SD card reader
could be reprobed when the apple-mfi-fastcharge after pivoting root
during boot up and the module became available.

Make sure that the driver probe isn't being run for unsupported
devices by adding a match function that checks the product ID, in
addition to the id_table checking the vendor ID.
