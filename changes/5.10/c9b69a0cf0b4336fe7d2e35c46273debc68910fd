KVM: arm64: Don't constrain maximum IPA size based on host configuration

Now that the guest stage-2 page-tables are managed independently from
the host stage-1 page-tables, we can avoid constraining the IPA size
based on the host and instead limit it only based on the PARange field
of the ID_AA64MMFR0 register.
