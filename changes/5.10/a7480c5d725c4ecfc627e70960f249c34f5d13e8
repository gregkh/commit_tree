irqchip/sifive-plic: Fix broken irq_set_affinity() callback

An interrupt submitted to an affinity change will always be left enabled
after plic_set_affinity() has been called, while the expectation is that
it should stay in whatever state it was before the call.

Preserving the configuration fixes a PWM hang issue on the Unleashed
board.
