x86: Use tracepoint_enabled() for msr tracepoints instead of open coding it

7f47d8cc039f ("x86, tracing, perf: Add trace point for MSR accesses") added
tracing of msr read and write, but because of complexity in having
tracepoints in headers, and even more so for a core header like msr.h, not
to mention the bloat a tracepoint adds to inline functions, a helper
function is needed to be called from the header.

Use the new tracepoint_enabled() macro in tracepoint-defs.h to test if the
tracepoint is active before calling the helper function, instead of open
coding the same logic, which requires knowing the internals of a tracepoint.
