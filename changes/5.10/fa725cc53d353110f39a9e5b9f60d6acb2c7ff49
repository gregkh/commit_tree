powerpc/watchpoint/ptrace: Introduce PPC_DEBUG_FEATURE_DATA_BP_ARCH_31

PPC_DEBUG_FEATURE_DATA_BP_ARCH_31 can be used to determine whether
we are running on an ISA 3.1 compliant machine. Which is needed to
determine DAR behaviour, 512 byte boundary limit etc. This was
requested by Pedro Miraglia Franco de Carvalho for extending
watchpoint features in gdb. Note that availability of 2nd DAWR is
independent of this flag and should be checked using
ppc_debug_info->num_data_bps.
