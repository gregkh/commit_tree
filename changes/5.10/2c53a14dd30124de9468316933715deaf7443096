btrfs: use own btree inode io_tree owner id

Btree inode is special compared to all other inode extent io_trees,
although it has a btrfs inode, it doesn't have the track_uptodate bit at
all.

This means a lot of things like extent locking doesn't even need to be
applied to btree io tree.

Since it's so special, adds a new owner value for it to make debuging a
little easier.
