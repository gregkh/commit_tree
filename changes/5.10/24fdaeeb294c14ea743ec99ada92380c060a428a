usb: cdns3: gadget: clear trb->length as zero after preparing every trb

It clears trb->length as zero before preparing td, but if scatter
buffer is used for td, there are several trbs within td, it needs to clear
every trb->length as zero, otherwise, the default value for trb->length
may not be zero after it begins to use the second round of trb rings.
