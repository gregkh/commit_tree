mm: Preserve the PG_arch_2 flag in __split_huge_page_tail()

When a huge page is split into normal pages, part of the head page flags
are transferred to the tail pages. However, the PG_arch_* flags are not
part of the preserved set.

PG_arch_2 is used by the arm64 MTE support to mark pages that have valid
tags. The absence of such flag would cause the arm64 set_pte_at() to
clear the tags in order to avoid stale tags exposed to user or the
swapping out hooks to ignore the tags. Not preserving PG_arch_2 on huge
page splitting leads to tag corruption in the tail pages.

Preserve the newly added PG_arch_2 flag in __split_huge_page_tail().
