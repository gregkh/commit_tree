docs: fb: Remove framebuffer scrollback boot option

In commit 50145474f6ef ("fbcon: remove soft scrollback code"), the
framebuffer scrollback mode was removed, but the documentation was not
updated.  Properly update the documentation by removing the option that
is no longer present, and update the section numbering because of the
removal.
