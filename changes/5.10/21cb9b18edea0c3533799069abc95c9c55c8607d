bus: mhi: core: Introduce sysfs entries for MHI

Introduce sysfs entries to enable userspace clients the ability to read
the serial number and the OEM PK Hash values obtained from BHI. OEMs
need to read these device-specific hardware information values through
userspace for factory testing purposes and cannot be exposed via degbufs
as it may remain disabled for performance reasons. Also, update the
documentation for ABI to include these entries.
