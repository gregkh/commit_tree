bpf, selftests: Extend test_tc_redirect to use modified bpf_redirect_neigh()

This updates the test_tc_neigh prog in selftests to use the new syntax of
bpf_redirect_neigh(). To exercise the helper both with and without the
optional parameter, add an additional test_tc_neigh_fib test program, which
does a bpf_fib_lookup() followed by a call to bpf_redirect_neigh() instead
of looking up the ifindex in a map.

Update the test_tc_redirect.sh script to run both versions of the test,
and while we're add it, fix it to work on systems that have a consolidated
dual-stack 'ping' binary instead of separate ping/ping6 versions.
