soundwire: qcom: clear BIT FIELDs before value set.

According to usage (bitfields.h) of REG_FIELDS,
Modify is:
  reg &= ~REG_FIELD_C;
  reg |= FIELD_PREP(REG_FIELD_C, c);

Patch ("soundwire: qcom : use FIELD_{GET|PREP}") seems to have
accidentally removed clearing bit field while modifying the register.

Fix this by using u32p_replace_bits() to clear and set the values.
