ethtool: add standard pause stats

Currently drivers have to report their pause frames statistics
via ethtool -S, and there is a wide variety of names used for
these statistics.

Add the two statistics defined in IEEE 802.3x to the standard
API. Create a new ethtool request header flag for including
statistics in the response to GET commands.

Always create the ETHTOOL_A_PAUSE_STATS nest in replies when
flag is set. Testing if driver declares the op is not a reliable
way of checking if any stats will actually be included and therefore
we don't want to give the impression that presence of
ETHTOOL_A_PAUSE_STATS indicates driver support.

Note that this patch does not include PFC counters, which may fit
better in dcbnl? But mostly I don't need them/have a setup to test
them so I haven't looked deeply into exposing them :)

v3:
 - add a helper for "uninitializing" stats, rather than a cryptic
   memset() (Andrew)
