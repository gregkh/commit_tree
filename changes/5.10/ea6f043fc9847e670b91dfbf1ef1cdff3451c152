x86: Make __get_user() generate an out-of-line call

Instead of inlining the whole stac/lfence/mov/clac sequence (which also
requires individual exception table entries and several asm instruction
alternatives entries), just generate "call __get_user_nocheck_X" for the
__get_user() cases.

We can use all the same infrastructure that we already do for the
regular "get_user()", and the end result is simpler source code, and
much simpler code generation.

It also means that when I introduce asm goto with input for
"unsafe_get_user()", there are no nasty interactions with the
__get_user() code.
