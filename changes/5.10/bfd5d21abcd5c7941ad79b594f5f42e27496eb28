arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Move common USB properties to msm8916.dtsi

Right now we define "hnp-disable", "srp-disable", "adp-disable"
separately for every MSM8916 board that has USB working.

They are needed for USB to work properly if CONFIG_USB_OTG_FSM
is enabled. This is because the chipidea OTG FSM code waits for
interrupts regarding the VBUS state (AVVIS). Those never happen
on MSM8916 because VBUS is always connected to the PMIC instead
of the USB controller.

There was a patch [1] to work around this but ultimately it was
decided that it's easier to disable the OTG FSM altogether using
these properties. This works fine for most use cases, because the
OTG FSM isn't needed for simple dual role host/gadget operation.

Given that these properties are needed for every MSM8916 device,
move them to msm8916.dtsi so we can avoid some more duplication.
