mac80211: handle S1G low rates

S1G doesn't have legacy (sband->bitrates) rates, only MCS.
For now, just send a frame at MCS 0 if a low rate is
requested. Note we also redefine (since we're out of TX
flags) TX_RC_VHT_MCS as TX_RC_S1G_MCS to indicate an S1G
MCS. This is probably OK as VHT MCS is not valid on S1G
band and vice versa.
