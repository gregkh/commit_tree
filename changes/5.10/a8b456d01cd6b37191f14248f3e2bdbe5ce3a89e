bdi: remove BDI_CAP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO

BDI_CAP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO is only checked in the swap code, and used to
decided if ->rw_page can be used on a block device.  Just check up for
the method instead.  The only complication is that zram needs a second
set of block_device_operations as it can switch between modes that
actually support ->rw_page and those who don't.
