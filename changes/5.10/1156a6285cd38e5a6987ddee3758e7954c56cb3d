powerpc/time: Make get_tbl() common to PPC32 and PPC64

On PPC64, get_tbl() is defined as an alias of get_tb() which return
the result of mftb(). That exactly the same as what the PPC32 version
does. We don't need two versions.

Remove the PPC64 definition of get_tbl() and use the PPC32 version
for both.
