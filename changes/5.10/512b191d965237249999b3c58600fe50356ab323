wcn36xx: Fix TX data path

This patch contains the following fixes:

- Use correct queue for submitting QoS packet. The queue id to use
is a one-to-one mapping with the TID.

- Don't encrypt a frame with IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_DONT_ENCRYPT flag.

- Use the 'special queue' for null packets, preventing the firmware
to submit it as AMPDU.
