ASoC: tas2770: Remove ti,asi-format code

Remove the code to support the asi-format binding property. The code
does nothing except read the property and set a variable. No additional
action is taken except to reset the variable. The property is supposed
to set the rising or falling RX edge detection of the SBCLK but this
edge detection is done by checking the DAI_FMT_INV_MASK.
