ext4: properly check for dirty state in ext4_inode_datasync_dirty()

ext4_inode_datasync_dirty() needs to return 'true' if the inode is
dirty, 'false' otherwise, but the logic seems to be incorrectly changed
by commit aa75f4d3daae ("ext4: main fast-commit commit path").

This introduces a problem with swap files that are always failing to be
activated, showing this error in dmesg:

 [   34.406479] swapon: file is not committed

Simple test case to reproduce the problem:

  # fallocate -l 8G swapfile
  # chmod 0600 swapfile
  # mkswap swapfile
  # swapon swapfile

Fix the logic to return the proper state of the inode.
