netfilter: conntrack: add clash resolution stat counter

There is a misconception about what "insert_failed" means.

We increment this even when a clash got resolved, so it might not indicate
a problem.

Add a dedicated counter for clash resolution and only increment
insert_failed if a clash cannot be resolved.

For the old /proc interface, export this in place of an older stat
that got removed a while back.
For ctnetlink, export this with a new attribute.

Also correct an outdated comment that implies we add a duplicate tuple --
we only add the (unique) reply direction.
