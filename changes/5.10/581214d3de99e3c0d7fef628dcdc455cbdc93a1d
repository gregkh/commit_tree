media: staging: rkisp1: params: don't release lock in isr before buffer is done

In the irq handler 'rkisp1_params_isr', the lock 'config_lock'
should be held as long as the current buffer is used. Otherwise the
stop_streaming calback might remove it from the list and
pass it to userspace while it is referenced in the irq handler.
