power: supply: bq27xxx: report "not charging" on all types

Commit 6f24ff97e323 ("power: supply: bq27xxx_battery: Add the
BQ27Z561 Battery monitor") and commit d74534c27775 ("power:
bq27xxx_battery: Add support for additional bq27xxx family devices")
added support for new device types by copying most of the code and
adding necessary quirks.

However they did not copy the code in bq27xxx_battery_status()
responsible for returning POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS_NOT_CHARGING.

Unify the bq27xxx_battery_status() so for all types when charger is
supplied, it will return "not charging" status.
