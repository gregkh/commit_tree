block: Make request_queue.rpm_status an enum

request_queue.rpm_status is assigned values of the rpm_status enum only,
so reflect that in its type.

Note that including <linux/pm.h> is (currently) a no-op, as it is
already included through <linux/genhd.h> and <linux/device.h>, but it is
better to play it safe.
