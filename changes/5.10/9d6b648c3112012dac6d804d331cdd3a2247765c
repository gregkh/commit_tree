bnxt_en: Update firmware interface spec to 1.10.1.65.

The main changes include FEC, ECN statistics, HWRM_PORT_PHY_QCFG
response size reduction, and a new counter added to
ctx_hw_stats_ext struct to support the new 58818 chip.

The ctx_hw_stats_ext structure is now the superset supporting the new
58818 chips and the prior P5 chips.  Add a new flag to identify the new
chip and use constants for the chip specific ring statistics sizes
instead of the size of the structure.

Because the HWRM_PORT_PHY_QCFG response structure size has shrunk back
to 96 bytes, the workaround added earlier to limit the size of this
message for forwarding to the VF can be removed.
