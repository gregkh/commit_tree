genetlink: add small version of ops

We want to add maxattr and policy back to genl_ops, to enable
dumping per command policy to user space. This, however, would
cause bloat for all the families with global policies. Introduce
smaller version of ops (half the size of genl_ops). Translate
these smaller ops into a full blown struct before use in the
core.

v1:
 - use struct assignment
 - put a full copy of the op in struct genl_dumpit_info
 - s/light/small/
