mm: cleanup the gfp_mask handling in __vmalloc_area_node

Patch series "two small vmalloc cleanups".

This patch (of 2):

__vmalloc_area_node currently has four different gfp_t variables to
just express this simple logic:

 - use the passed in mask, plus __GFP_NOWARN and __GFP_HIGHMEM (if
   suitable) for the underlying page allocation
 - use just the reclaim flags from the passed in mask plus __GFP_ZERO
   for allocating the page array

Simplify this down to just use the pre-existing nested_gfp as-is for
the page array allocation, and just the passed in gfp_mask for the
page allocation, after conditionally ORing __GFP_HIGHMEM into it.  This
also makes the allocation warning a little more correct.

Also initialize two variables at the time of declaration while touching
this area.
