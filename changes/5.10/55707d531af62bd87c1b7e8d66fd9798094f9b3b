tpm_tis: Add a check for invalid status

Some TIS based TPMs can return 0xff to status reads if the locality
hasn't been properly requested.  Detect this condition by checking the
bits that the TIS spec specifies must return zero are clear and return
zero in that case.  Also drop a warning so the problem can be
identified in the calling path and fixed (usually a missing
try_get_ops()).
