ptp: Add generic ptp v2 header parsing function

Reason: A lot of the ptp drivers - which implement hardware time stamping - need
specific fields such as the sequence id from the ptp v2 header. Currently all
drivers implement that themselves.

Introduce a generic function to retrieve a pointer to the start of the ptp v2
header.
