ASoC: Intel: add codec name prefix to ACPI machine description

The current SOF machine driver adds a name prefix for each codec,
mainly to differentiate ALSA controls for left and right amplifiers.

This is a good idea, but the machine driver duplicates some of the
information that already exists in ACPI descriptors, so add those
prefixes there. Follow-up patches will make use of the information
encoded in these tables and remove duplication.
