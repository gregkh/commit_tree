i2c: smbus: add core function handling SMBus host-notify

SMBus Host-Notify protocol, from the adapter point of view
consist of receiving a message from a client, including the
client address and some other data.

It can be simply handled by creating a new slave device
and registering a callback performing the parsing of the
message received from the client.

This commit introduces two new core functions
  * i2c_new_slave_host_notify_device
  * i2c_free_slave_host_notify_device
that take care of registration of the new slave device and
callback and will call i2c_handle_smbus_host_notify once a
Host-Notify event is received.
