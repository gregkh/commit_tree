l2tp: report rx cookie discards in netlink get

When an L2TPv3 session receives a data frame with an incorrect cookie
l2tp_core logs a warning message and bumps a stats counter to reflect
the fact that the packet has been dropped.

However, the stats counter in question is missing from the l2tp_netlink
get message for tunnel and session instances.

Include the statistic in the netlink get response.
