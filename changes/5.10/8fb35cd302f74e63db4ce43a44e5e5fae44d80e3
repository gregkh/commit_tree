bnxt_en: Set driver default message level.

Currently, bp->msg_enable has default value of 0.  It is more useful
to have the commonly used NETIF_MSG_DRV and NETIF_MSG_HW enabled by
default.

v2: Change the fall back bnxt_reset_task() inside bnxt_rx_ring_reset()
to silent mode.  With older fw, we would take the fall back path and
it would be very noisy.
