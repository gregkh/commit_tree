drivers/virt/fsl_hypervisor: Fix error handling path

First, when memory allocation for sg_list_unaligned failed, there
is a bug of calling put_pages() as we haven't pinned any pages.

Second, if get_user_pages_fast() failed we should unpin num_pinned
pages.

This will address both.

As part of these changes, minor update in documentation.
