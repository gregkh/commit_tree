s390/sclp: Add support for SCLP AP adapter config/deconfig

Add support for AP bus adapter config and deconfig to the sclp
core code. The code is statically build into the kernel when
ZCRYPT is configured either as module or with static support.

This is the base functionality for having configure/deconfigure
support in the AP bus and card code. Another patch will exploit
this soon.
