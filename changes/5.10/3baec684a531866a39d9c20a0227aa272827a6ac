PCI: brcmstb: Accommodate MSI for older chips

Older BrcmSTB chips do not have a separate register for MSI interrupts; the
MSIs are in a register that also contains unrelated interrupts.  In
addition, the interrupts lie in bits [31..24] for these legacy chips.  This
commit provides common code for both legacy and non-legacy MSI interrupt
registers.
