jbd2, ext4, ocfs2: introduce/use journal callbacks j_submit|finish_inode_data_buffers()

Introduce journal callbacks to allow different behaviors
for an inode in journal_submit|finish_inode_data_buffers().

The existing users of the current behavior (ext4, ocfs2)
are adapted to use the previously exported functions
that implement the current behavior.

Users are callers of jbd2_journal_inode_ranged_write|wait(),
which adds the inode to the transaction's inode list with
the JI_WRITE|WAIT_DATA flags. Only ext4 and ocfs2 in-tree.

Both CONFIG_EXT4_FS and CONFIG_OCSFS2_FS select CONFIG_JBD2,
which builds fs/jbd2/commit.c and journal.c that define and
export the functions, so we can call directly in ext4/ocfs2.
