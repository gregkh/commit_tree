dma-mapping: add a new dma_alloc_noncoherent API

Add a new API to allocate and free memory that is guaranteed to be
addressable by a device, but which potentially is not cache coherent
for DMA.

To transfer ownership to and from the device, the existing streaming
DMA API calls dma_sync_single_for_device and dma_sync_single_for_cpu
must be used.

For now the new calls are implemented on top of dma_alloc_attrs just
like the old-noncoherent API, but once all drivers are switched to
the new API it will be replaced with a better working implementation
that is available on all architectures.
