i2c: tegra: Add missing pm_runtime_put()

The pm_runtime_get_sync() always bumps refcount regardless of whether it
succeeds or fails. Hence driver is responsible for restoring of the RPM
refcounting. This patch adds missing RPM puts which restore refcounting
in a case of pm_runtime_get_sync() error.
