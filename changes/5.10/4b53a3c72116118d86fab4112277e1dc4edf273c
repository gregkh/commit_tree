ocxl: fix kconfig dependency warning for OCXL

When OCXL is enabled and HOTPLUG_PCI is disabled, it results in the
following Kbuild warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for HOTPLUG_PCI_POWERNV
  Depends on [n]: PCI [=y] && HOTPLUG_PCI [=n] && PPC_POWERNV [=y] && EEH [=y]
  Selected by [y]:
  - OCXL [=y] && PPC_POWERNV [=y] && PCI [=y] && EEH [=y]

The reason is that OCXL selects HOTPLUG_PCI_POWERNV without depending on
or selecting HOTPLUG_PCI while HOTPLUG_PCI_POWERNV is subordinate to
HOTPLUG_PCI.

HOTPLUG_PCI_POWERNV is a visible symbol with a set of dependencies.
Selecting it will lead to overlooking its other dependencies as well.

Let OCXL depend on HOTPLUG_PCI_POWERNV instead to avoid Kbuild issues.
