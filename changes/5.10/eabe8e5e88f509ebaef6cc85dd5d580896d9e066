net/mlx5: Handle sync reset now event

On sync_reset_now event the driver does reload and PCI link toggle to
activate firmware upgrade reset. When the firmware sends this event it
syncs the event on all PFs, so all PFs will do PCI link toggle at once.
To do PCI link toggle, the driver ensures that no other device ID under
the same bridge by checking that all the PF functions under the same PCI
bridge have same device ID. If no other device it uses PCI bridge link
control to turn link down and up.
