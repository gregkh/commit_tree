bpf: Move btf_resolve_size into __btf_resolve_size

Moving btf_resolve_size into __btf_resolve_size and
keeping btf_resolve_size public with just first 3
arguments, because the rest of the arguments are not
used by outside callers.

Following changes are adding more arguments, which
are not useful to outside callers. They will be added
to the __btf_resolve_size function.
