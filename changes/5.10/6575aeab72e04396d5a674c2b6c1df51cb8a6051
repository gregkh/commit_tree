Documentation: better locations for sysfs-pci, sysfs-tagging

sysfs-pci and sysfs-tagging were mis-filed: their locations within
Documentation/ implied that they were related to file systems. Actually,
each topic is about a very specific *use* of sysfs, and sysfs *happens*
to be a (virtual) filesystem, so this is not really the right place.

It's jarring to be reading about filesystems in general and then come
across these specific details about PCI, and tagging...and then back to
general filesystems again.

Move sysfs-pci to PCI, and move sysfs-tagging to networking. (Thanks to
Jonathan Corbet for coming up with the final locations.)
