x86/sev-es: Setup an early #VC handler

Setup an early handler for #VC exceptions. There is no GHCB mapped
yet, so just re-use the vc_no_ghcb_handler(). It can only handle
CPUID exit-codes, but that should be enough to get the kernel through
verify_cpu() and __startup_64() until it runs on virtual addresses.
