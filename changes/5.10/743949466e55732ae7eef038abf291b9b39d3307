watchdog: imx7ulp: Strictly follow the sequence for wdog operations

According to reference manual, the i.MX7ULP WDOG's operations except
refresh should follow below sequence:

1. disable global interrupts;
2. unlock the wdog and wait unlock bit set;
3. reconfigure the wdog and wait for reconfiguration bit set;
4. enabel global interrupts.

Strictly follow the recommended sequence can make it more robust.
