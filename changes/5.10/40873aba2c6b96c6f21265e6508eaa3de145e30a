checkpatch: add test for comma use that should be semicolon

There are commas used as statement terminations that should typically have
used semicolons instead.  Only direct assignments or use of a single
function or value on a single line are detected by this test.

e.g.:
	foo = bar(),		/* typical use is semicolon not comma */
	bar = baz();

Add an imperfect test to detect these comma uses.

No false positives were found in testing, but many types of false
negatives are possible.

e.g.:
	foo = bar() + 1,	/* comma use, but not direct assignment */
	bar = baz();
