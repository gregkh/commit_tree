powerpc/64: Remove unused generic_secondary_thread_init()

The last caller was removed in 2014 in commit fb5a515704d7 ("powerpc:
Remove platforms/wsp and associated pieces").

As Jordan noticed even though there are no callers, the code above in
fsl_secondary_thread_init() falls through into
generic_secondary_thread_init(). So we can remove the _GLOBAL but not
the body of the function.

However because fsl_secondary_thread_init() is inside #ifdef
CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3E, we can never reach the body of
generic_secondary_thread_init() unless CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3E is enabled,
so we can wrap the whole thing in a single #ifdef.
