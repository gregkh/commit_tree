lockdep: Reduce the size of lock_list::distance

lock_list::distance is always not greater than MAX_LOCK_DEPTH (which
is 48 right now), so a u16 will fit. This patch reduces the size of
lock_list::distance to save space, so that we can introduce other fields
to help detect recursive read lock deadlocks without increasing the size
of lock_list structure.
