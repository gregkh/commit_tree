octeontx2-af: fix Extended DSA and eDSA parsing

KPU profile interpret Extended DSA and eDSA by looking source dev. This
was incorrect and it restricts to use few source device ids and also
created confusion while parsing regular DSA tag. With below patch lookup
was based on bit 12 of Word0. This is always zero for DSA tag and it
should be one for Extended DSA and eDSA.
