powerpc/64s: rename pnv|pseries_setup_rfi_flush to _setup_security_mitigations

pseries|pnv_setup_rfi_flush already does the count cache flush setup, and
we just added entry and uaccess flushes. So the name is not very accurate
any more. In both platforms we then also immediately setup the STF flush.

Rename them to _setup_security_mitigations and fold the STF flush in.
