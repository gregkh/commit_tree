xsk: i40e: ice: ixgbe: mlx5: Rename xsk zero-copy driver interfaces

Rename the AF_XDP zero-copy driver interface functions to better
reflect what they do after the replacement of umems with buffer
pools in the previous commit. Mostly it is about replacing the
umem name from the function names with xsk_buff and also have
them take the a buffer pool pointer instead of a umem. The
various ring functions have also been renamed in the process so
that they have the same naming convention as the internal
functions in xsk_queue.h. This so that it will be clearer what
they do and also for consistency.
