Bluetooth: hci_intel: enable on new platform

On new Intel platform the device is provided with INT33E3 ID.
Append it to the list.

This will require ACPI_GPIO_QUIRK_ONLY_GPIOIO to be enabled because
the relevant ASL looks like:

	UartSerialBusV2 ( ... )
	GpioInt ( ... ) { ... }
	GpioIo ( ... ) { ... }

which means that first GPIO resource is an interrupt, while we are expecting it
to be reset one (output). Do the same for host-wake because in case of
GpioInt() the platform_get_irq() will do the job and should return correct
Linux IRQ number. That said, host-wake GPIO can only be GpioIo() resource.

While here, drop commas in terminator lines.
