spi: dw: Use relaxed IO-methods to access FIFOs

In accordance with [1] the relaxed methods are guaranteed to be ordered
with respect to other accesses from the same CPU thread to the same
peripheral.  This is what we need during the data read/write from/to the
controller FIFOs being executed within a single IRQ handler or a kernel
task.

Such optimization shall significantly speed the data reader and writer up.
For instance, the relaxed IO-accessors utilization on Baikal-T1 lets the
driver to support the SPI memory operations with bus frequency three-fold
faster than if normal IO-accessors would be used.
