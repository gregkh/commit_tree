staging: comedi: cb_pcidas: Allow 2-channel commands for AO subdevice

The "cb_pcidas" driver supports asynchronous commands on the analog
output (AO) subdevice for those boards that have an AO FIFO.  The code
(in `cb_pcidas_ao_check_chanlist()` and `cb_pcidas_ao_cmd()`) to
validate and set up the command supports output to a single channel or
to two channels simultaneously (the boards have two AO channels).
However, the code in `cb_pcidas_auto_attach()` that initializes the
subdevices neglects to initialize the AO subdevice's `len_chanlist`
member, leaving it set to 0, but the Comedi core will "correct" it to 1
if the driver neglected to set it.  This limits commands to use a single
channel (either channel 0 or 1), but the limit should be two channels.
Set the AO subdevice's `len_chanlist` member to be the same value as the
`n_chan` member, which will be 2.
