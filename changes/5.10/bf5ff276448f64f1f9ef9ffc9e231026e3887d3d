x86/realmode: Add SEV-ES specific trampoline entry point

The code at the trampoline entry point is executed in real-mode. In
real-mode, #VC exceptions can't be handled so anything that might cause
such an exception must be avoided.

In the standard trampoline entry code this is the WBINVD instruction and
the call to verify_cpu(), which are both not needed anyway when running
as an SEV-ES guest.
