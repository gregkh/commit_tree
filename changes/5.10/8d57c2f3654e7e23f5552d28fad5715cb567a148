i2c: tegra: Remove "dma" variable from tegra_i2c_xfer_msg()

The "dma" variable of tegra_i2c_xfer_msg() function doesn't bring much in
regards to readability and generation of the code.

Besides readability, it's also not very nice that the is_curr_dma_xfer
is initialized in tegra_i2c_xfer_msg() and then could be overridden by
tegra_i2c_config_fifo_trig(). In a result, the "dma" variable creates
slight confusion since it's not instantly obvious why it's set after
tegra_i2c_config_fifo_trig().

Hence should be better to have the variable removed. This makes code
more consistent.
