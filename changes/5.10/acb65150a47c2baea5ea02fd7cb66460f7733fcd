perf record: Support sample-read topdown metric group

With the hardware TopDown metrics feature, sample-read feature should be
supported for a topdown group, e.g., sample a non-topdown event and read
a topdown metric group. But the current perf record code errors out.

For a topdown metric group, the slots event must be the leader of the
group, but the leader slots event doesn't support sampling.

To support sample-read the topdown metric group, use the 2nd event of
the group as the "leader" for the purposes of sampling.

Only the platform with Topdown metic feature supports sample-read the
topdown group. Add arch_topdown_sample_read() to indicate whether the
topdown group supports sample-read.
