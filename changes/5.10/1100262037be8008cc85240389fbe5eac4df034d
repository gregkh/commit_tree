selftests/vm: 8x compaction_test speedup

This patch reduces the running time for compaction_test from about 27 sec,
to 3.3 sec, which is about an 8x speedup.

These numbers are for an Intel x86_64 system with 32 GB of DRAM.

The compaction_test.c program was spending most of its time doing mmap(),
1 MB at a time, on about 25 GB of memory.

Instead, do the mmaps 100 MB at a time.  (Going past 100 MB doesn't make
things go much faster, because other parts of the program are using the
remaining time.)
