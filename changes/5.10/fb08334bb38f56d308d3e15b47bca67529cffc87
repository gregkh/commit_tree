nfs: remove incorrect fallthrough label

There is no case after the default from which to fallthrough to. Clang
will error in this case (unhelpfully without context, see link below)
and GCC will with -Wswitch-unreachable.

The previous commit should have just replaced the comment with a break
statement.

If we consider implicit fallthrough to be a design mistake of C, then
all case statements should be terminated with one of the following
statements:
* break
* continue
* return
* fallthrough
* goto
* (call of function with __attribute__(__noreturn__))
