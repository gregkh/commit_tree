libbpf: Parse multi-function sections into multiple BPF programs

Teach libbpf how to parse code sections into potentially multiple bpf_program
instances, based on ELF FUNC symbols. Each BPF program will keep track of its
position within containing ELF section for translating section instruction
offsets into program instruction offsets: regardless of BPF program's location
in ELF section, it's first instruction is always at local instruction offset
0, so when libbpf is working with relocations (which use section-based
instruction offsets) this is critical to make proper translations.
