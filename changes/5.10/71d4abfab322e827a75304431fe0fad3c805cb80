vc_screen: rewrite vcs_size to accept vc, not inode

It is weird to fetch the information from the inode over and over. Read
and write already have the needed information, so rewrite vcs_size to
accept a vc, attr and unicode and adapt vcs_lseek to that.

Also make sure all sites check the return value of vcs_size for errors.

And document it using kernel-doc.
