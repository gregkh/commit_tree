usb: typec: tcpci_maxim: Chip level TCPC driver

Chip level TCPC driver for Maxim's TCPCI implementation.
This TCPC implementation does not support the following
commands: COMMAND.SinkVbus, COMMAND.SourceVbusDefaultVoltage,
COMMAND.SourceVbusHighVoltage. Instead the sinking and sourcing
from vbus is supported by writes to custom registers.
