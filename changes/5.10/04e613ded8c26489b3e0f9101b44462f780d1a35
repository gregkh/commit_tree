arm64: smp: Tell RCU about CPUs that fail to come online

Commit ce3d31ad3cac ("arm64/smp: Move rcu_cpu_starting() earlier") ensured
that RCU is informed early about incoming CPUs that might end up calling
into printk() before they are online. However, if such a CPU fails the
early CPU feature compatibility checks in check_local_cpu_capabilities(),
then it will be powered off or parked without informing RCU, leading to
an endless stream of stalls:

  | rcu: INFO: rcu_preempt detected stalls on CPUs/tasks:
  | rcu:	2-O...: (0 ticks this GP) idle=002/1/0x4000000000000000 softirq=0/0 fqs=2593
  | (detected by 0, t=5252 jiffies, g=9317, q=136)
  | Task dump for CPU 2:
  | task:swapper/2       state:R  running task     stack:    0 pid:    0 ppid:     1 flags:0x00000028
  | Call trace:
  | ret_from_fork+0x0/0x30

Ensure that the dying CPU invokes rcu_report_dead() prior to being powered
off or parked.
