drm/i915/rkl: Add initial workarounds

RKL and TGL share some general gen12 workarounds, but each platform also
has its own platform-specific workarounds.

v2:
 - Add Wa_1604555607 for RKL.  This makes RKL's ctx WA list identical to
   TGL's, so we'll have both functions call the tgl_ function for now;
   this workaround isn't listed for DG1 so we don't want to add it to
   the general gen12_ function.
