PM: AVS: qcom-cpr: Move the driver to the qcom specific drivers

The avs drivers are all SoC specific drivers that doesn't share any code.
Instead they are located in a directory, mostly to keep similar
functionality together. From a maintenance point of view, it makes better
sense to collect SoC specific drivers like these, into the SoC specific
directories.

Therefore, let's move the qcom-cpr driver to the qcom directory.
