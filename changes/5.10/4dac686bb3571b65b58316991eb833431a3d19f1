mmc: sdhci-msm: Enable restore_dll_config flag for sc7180 target

On sc7180 target, issues are observed with HS400 mode due to a
hardware limitation. If sdcc clock is dynamically gated and ungated,
the very next command is failing with command CRC/timeout errors.

To mitigate this issue, DLL phase has to be restored whenever sdcc
clock is gated dynamically. The restore_dll_config ensures this.
Enabling this flag with this change. And simply re-using the sdm845
target configuration for this flag.
