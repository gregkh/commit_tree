arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Drop qcom,tcsr-mutex syscon

The hwlock device node does not (directly) use memory resources
of the SoC, so we should move it outside the "soc" node.

However, as of commit 7a1e6fb1c606 ("hwspinlock: qcom: Allow mmio usage
in addition to syscon") we can now assign the memory region directly
to the hwlock device node. This works because the register space
used by it is actually separate and not used by any other components.
