tools/bootconfig: Add a script to generates bootconfig from ftrace

Add a ftrace2bconf.sh under tools/bootconfig/scripts which generates
a bootconfig file from the current ftrace settings.

To read the ftrace settings, ftrace2bconf.sh requires the root
privilege (or sudo). The ftrace2bconf.sh will output the bootconfig
to stdout and error messages to stderr, so usually you'll run it as

 # ftrace2bconf.sh > ftrace.bconf

Note that some ftrace configurations are not supported. For example,
function-call/callgraph trace/notrace settings are not supported because
the wildcard has been expanded and lost in the ftrace anymore.
