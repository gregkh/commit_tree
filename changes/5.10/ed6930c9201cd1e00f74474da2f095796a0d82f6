io_uring: fix break condition for __io_uring_register() waiting

Colin reports that there's unreachable code, since we only ever break
if ret == 0. This is correct, and is due to a reversed logic condition
in when to break or not.

Break out of the loop if we don't process any task work, in that case
we do want to return -EINTR.
