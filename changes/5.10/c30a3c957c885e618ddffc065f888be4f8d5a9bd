netlink: policy: correct validation type check

In the policy export for binary attributes I erroneously used
a != NLA_VALIDATE_NONE comparison instead of checking for the
two possible values, which meant that if a validation function
pointer ended up aliasing the min/max as negatives, we'd hit
a warning in nla_get_range_unsigned().

Fix this to correctly check for only the two types that should
be handled here, i.e. range with or without warn-too-long.
