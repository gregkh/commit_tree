gfs2: check for empty rgrp tree in gfs2_ri_update

If gfs2 tries to mount a (corrupt) file system that has no resource
groups it still tries to set preferences on the first one, which causes
a kernel null pointer dereference. This patch adds a check to function
gfs2_ri_update so this condition is detected and reported back as an
error.
