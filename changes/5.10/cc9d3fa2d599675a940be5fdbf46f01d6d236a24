media: tegra-video: Compute settle times based on the clock rate

Settle time determines the number of cil clock cyles to wait after
LP00 when moving from LP to HS.

This patch computes T-CLK-SETTLE and T-HS-SETTLE times based on cil
clock rate and pixel rate from the sensor and programs them during
streaming.

T-CLK-SETTLE time is the interval during which receiver will ignore
any HS transitions on clock lane starting from the beginning of
T-CLK-PREPARE.

T-HS-SETTLE time is the interval during which recevier will ignore
any HS transitions on data lane starting from the beginning of
T-HS-PREPARE.
