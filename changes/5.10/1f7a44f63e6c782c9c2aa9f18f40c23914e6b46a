compiler-clang: add build check for clang 10.0.1

Patch series "set clang minimum version to 10.0.1", v3.

Adds a compile time #error to compiler-clang.h setting the effective
minimum supported version to clang 10.0.1.  A separate patch has already
been picked up into the Documentation/ tree also confirming the version.

Next are a series of reverts. One for 32b arm is a partial revert.

Then Marco suggested fixes to KASAN docs.

Finally, improve the warning for GCC too as per Kees.

This patch (of 7):

During Plumbers 2020, we voted to just support the latest release of Clang
for now.  Add a compile time check for this.

We plan to remove workarounds for older versions now, which will break in
subtle and not so subtle ways.
