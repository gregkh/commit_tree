samples: bpf: Refactor kprobe tracing programs with libbpf

For the problem of increasing fragmentation of the bpf loader programs,
instead of using bpf_loader.o, which is used in samples/bpf, this
commit refactors the existing kprobe tracing programs with libbbpf
bpf loader.

    - For kprobe events pointing to system calls, the SYSCALL() macro in
    trace_common.h was used.
    - Adding a kprobe event and attaching a bpf program to it was done
    through bpf_program_attach().
    - Instead of using the existing BPF MAP definition, MAP definition
    has been refactored with the new BTF-defined MAP format.
