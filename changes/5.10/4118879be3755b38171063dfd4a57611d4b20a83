scsi: qedi: Mark all connections for recovery on link down event

For short time cable pulls, the in-flight I/O to the firmware is never
cleaned up, resulting in the behaviour of stale I/O completion causing
list_del corruption and soft lockup of the system.

On link down event, mark all the connections for recovery, causing cleanup
of all the in-flight I/O immediately.
