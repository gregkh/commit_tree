brcmfmac: support 4-way handshake offloading for WPA/WPA2-PSK in AP mode

Firmware may have authenticator code built-in. This is detected by the
driver and indicated in the wiphy features flags. User space can use
this flag to determine whether or not to provide the pre-shared key
material in the nl80211 start AP command to offload the 4-way handshake
in AP mode.
