usb: cdns3: gadget: handle sg list use case at completion correctly

- Judge each TRB has been handled at cdns3_trb_handled, since
the DMA pointer may be at the middle of the TD, we can't consider
this TD has finished at that time.
- Calculate req->actual according to finished TRBs.
- Handle short transfer for sg list use case correctly. When the
short transfer occurs, we check OUT_SMM at TRB to see if it is
the last TRB.
