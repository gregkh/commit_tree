arm64: Move console stack display code to stacktrace.c

Currently the code for displaying a stack trace on the console is located
in traps.c rather than stacktrace.c, using the unwinding code that is in
stacktrace.c. This can be confusing and make the code hard to find since
such output is often referred to as a stack trace which might mislead the
unwary. Due to this and since traps.c doesn't interact with this code
except for via the public interfaces move the code to stacktrace.c to
make it easier to find.
