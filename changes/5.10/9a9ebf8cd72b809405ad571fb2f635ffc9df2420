RDMA: Restore ability to fail on AH destroy

Like any other IB verbs objects, AH are refcounted by ib_core. The release
of those objects are controlled by ib_core with promise that AH destroy
can't fail.

Being SW object for now, this change makes dealloc_ah() to behave like any
other destroy IB flows.
