clocksource/drivers/sp804: Add support for Hisilicon sp804 timer

The ARM SP804 supports a maximum of 32-bit counter, but Hisilicon extends
it to 64-bit. That means, the registers: TimerXload, TimerXValue and
TimerXBGLoad are 64bits, all other registers are the same as those in the
SP804. The driver code can be completely reused except that the register
offset is different.

Use compatible = "hisilicon,sp804" mark as Hisilicon sp804 timer.
