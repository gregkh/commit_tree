perf/x86/intel: Introduce the fourth fixed counter

The fourth fixed counter, TOPDOWN.SLOTS, is introduced in Ice Lake to
measure the level 1 TopDown events.

Add MSR address and macros for the new fixed counter, which will be used
in a later patch.

Add comments to explain the event encoding rules for the fixed counters.
