io_uring: cap SQ submit size for SQPOLL with multiple rings

In the spirit of fairness, cap the max number of SQ entries we'll submit
for SQPOLL if we have multiple rings. If we don't do that, we could be
submitting tons of entries for one ring, while others are waiting to get
service.

The value of 8 is somewhat arbitrarily chosen as something that allows
a fair bit of batching, without using an excessive time per ring.
