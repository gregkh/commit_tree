ASoC: SOF: topology: fix the process being scheduled on core0 always

In commit 783898ce68de ("ASoC: SOF: append extended data to
sof_ipc_comp_process") the process components are set to run on the
fixed core 0, this break us from scheduling components on any other DSP
core.

Since we can get the DSP core index from swidget->core, it is duplicated
to pass the extra 'core' argument for those sof_widget_load_xx()
functions.

Here removes the duplicate 'core' argument and get component core from
swidget->core directly to fix the issue mentioned above.
