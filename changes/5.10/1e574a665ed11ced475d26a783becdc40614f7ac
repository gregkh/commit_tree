ARM: samsung: remove s3c_pm_debug_init()

On s3c24xx and s3c64xx, this is just a wrapper around
s3c_pm_debug_init_uart(), but this function does not exist on s5pv210,
which always uses an empty stub as CONFIG_SAMSUNG_ATAGS is normally
not set.

In a configuration that supports both s5pv210 and s3c64xx, we would
always call the s3c64xx function, which is probably incorrect when
running on s5pv210.

Remove the function call completely on s5pv210 and skip the wrapper on
s3c as a cleanup.

As a side-effect, the s3c64xx behavior is now always the same, regardless
of whether it is a DT-only configuration or both DT and ATAGS are
supported for booting.
