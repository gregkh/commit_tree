staging: rtl8723bs: remove cckrates{only}_included()

In rtw_ieee80211.c there are rtw_is_cckrates_included() and
rtw_is_cckratesonly_included() which have the same functionality as
cckrates_included() and cckrates_only_included() defined in
rtw_wlan_util.c. Remove the functions from rtw_wlan_util.c and use
those from rtw_ieee80211.c. Remove the now unused variable ratelen.
