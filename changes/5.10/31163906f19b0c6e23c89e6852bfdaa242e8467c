media: dt-bindings: media: Correct samsung-fimc parallel port numbering

The parallel port nodes should be numbered 1 and 2, not 0 and 1
for A and B respectively.  The driver has always implemented 1
and 2 and the in-tree Goni DTS uses 1 as port A as well.  Update
the documentation to match this behaviour.
