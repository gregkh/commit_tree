KVM: nSVM: Avoid freeing uninitialized pointers in svm_set_nested_state()

The save and ctl pointers are passed uninitialized to kfree() when
svm_set_nested_state() follows the 'goto out_set_gif' path. While the
issue could've been fixed by initializing these on-stack varialbles to
NULL, it seems preferable to eliminate 'out_set_gif' label completely as
it is not actually a failure path and duplicating a single svm_set_gif()
call doesn't look too bad.
