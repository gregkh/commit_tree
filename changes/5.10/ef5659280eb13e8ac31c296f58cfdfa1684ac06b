bpf, sockmap: Allow skipping sk_skb parser program

Currently, we often run with a nop parser namely one that just does
this, 'return skb->len'. This happens when either our verdict program
can handle streaming data or it is only looking at socket data such
as IP addresses and other metadata associated with the flow. The second
case is common for a L3/L4 proxy for instance.

So lets allow loading programs without the parser then we can skip
the stream parser logic and avoid having to add a BPF program that
is effectively a nop.
