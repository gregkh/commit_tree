kprobes: Remove NMI context check

The in_nmi() check in pre_handler_kretprobe() is meant to avoid
recursion, and blindly assumes that anything NMI is recursive.

However, since commit:

  9b38cc704e84 ("kretprobe: Prevent triggering kretprobe from within kprobe_flush_task")

there is a better way to detect and avoid actual recursion.

By setting a dummy kprobe, any actual exceptions will terminate early
(by trying to handle the dummy kprobe), and recursion will not happen.

Employ this to avoid the kretprobe_table_lock() recursion, replacing
the over-eager in_nmi() check.
