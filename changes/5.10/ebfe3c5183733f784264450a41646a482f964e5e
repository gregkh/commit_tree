rtnetlink: fix data overflow in rtnl_calcit()

"ip addr show" command execute error when we have a physical
network card with a large number of VFs

The return value of if_nlmsg_size() in rtnl_calcit() will exceed
range of u16 data type when any network cards has a larger number of
VFs. rtnl_vfinfo_size() will significant increase needed dump size when
the value of num_vfs is larger.

Eventually we get a wrong value of min_ifinfo_dump_size because of overflow
which decides the memory size needed by netlink dump and netlink_dump()
will return -EMSGSIZE because of not enough memory was allocated.

So fix it by promoting  min_dump_alloc data type to u32 to
avoid whole netlink message size overflow and it's also align
with the data type of struct netlink_callback{}.min_dump_alloc
which is assigned by return value of rtnl_calcit()
