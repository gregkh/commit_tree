perf/x86: Fix n_pair for cancelled txn

Kan reported that n_metric gets corrupted for cancelled transactions;
a similar issue exists for n_pair for AMD's Large Increment thing.

The problem was confirmed and confirmed fixed by Kim using:

  sudo perf stat -e "{cycles,cycles,cycles,cycles}:D" -a sleep 10 &

  # should succeed:
  sudo perf stat -e "{fp_ret_sse_avx_ops.all}:D" -a workload

  # should fail:
  sudo perf stat -e "{fp_ret_sse_avx_ops.all,fp_ret_sse_avx_ops.all,cycles}:D" -a workload

  # previously failed, now succeeds with this patch:
  sudo perf stat -e "{fp_ret_sse_avx_ops.all}:D" -a workload
