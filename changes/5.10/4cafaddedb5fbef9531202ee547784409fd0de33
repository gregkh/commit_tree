spi: spi-mtk-nor: fix timeout calculation overflow

CLK_TO_US macro is used to calculate potential transfer time for various
timeout handling. However it overflows on transfer bigger than 512 bytes
because it first did (len * 8 * 1000000).
This controller typically operates at 45MHz. This patch did 2 things:
1. calculate clock / 1000000 first
2. add a 4M transfer size cap so that the final timeout in DMA reading
   doesn't overflow
