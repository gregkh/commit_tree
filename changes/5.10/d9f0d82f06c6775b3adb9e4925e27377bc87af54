USB: legousbtower: use usb_control_msg_recv()

The usb_control_msg_recv() function can handle data on the stack, as
well as properly detecting short reads, so move to use that function
instead of the older usb_control_msg() call.  This ends up removing a
lot of extra lines in the driver.

v2: change API of usb_control_msg_send()
