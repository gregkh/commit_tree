media: atomisp: fix "dubious: !x | !y" sparse warning

Upon running Sparse, "warning: dubious: !x | !y" is brought to notice
for this file.  Logical and bitwise OR are basically the same in this
context, so it doesn't cause a runtime bug.  But let's change it to
logical OR to make it a little bit cleaner and silence the Sparse
warning.
