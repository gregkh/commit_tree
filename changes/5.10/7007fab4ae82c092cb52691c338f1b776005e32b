power: reset: POWER_RESET_OCELOT_RESET should depend on Ocelot or Sparx5

To add support for Sparx5, the dependency on MSCC_OCELOT was removed.
However, this increases exposure of the driver question not only to
Sparx5 platforms, but to everyone.  Hence re-add the dependency on
MSCC_OCELOT, and extend it with ARCH_SPARX5, to prevent asking the user
about this driver when configuring a kernel without Ocelot and Sparx5
support.
