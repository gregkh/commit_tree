ALSA: make snd_kcontrol_new name a normal string

When building with W=2, there are lots of warnings about the
snd_kcontrol_new name field being an array of 'unsigned char'
but initialized to a string:

include/sound/soc.h:93:48: warning: pointer targets in initialization of 'const unsigned char *' from 'char *' differ in signedness [-Wpointer-sign]

Make it a regular 'char *' to avoid flooding the build log with this.
