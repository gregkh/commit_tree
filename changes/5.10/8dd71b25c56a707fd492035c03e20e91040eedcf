ocfs2: fix potential soft lockup during fstrim

When we discard unused blocks on a mounted ocfs2 filesystem, fstrim
handles each block goup with locking/unlocking global bitmap meta-file
repeatedly. we should let fstrim thread take a break(if need) between
unlock and lock, this will avoid the potential soft lockup problem,
and also gives the upper applications more IO opportunities, these
applications are not blocked for too long at writing files.
