sched/topology: Split out SD_* flags declaration to its own file

To associate the SD flags with some metadata, we need some more structure
in the way they are declared.

Rather than shove that in a free-standing macro list, move the declaration
in a separate file that can be re-imported with different SD_FLAG
definitions. This is inspired by what is done with the syscall
table (see uapi/asm/unistd.h and sys_call_table).

The value assigned to a given SD flag now depends on the order it appears
in sd_flags.h. No change in functionality.
