drop_monitor: Filter control packets in drop monitor

Previously, devlink called into drop monitor in order to report hardware
originated drops / exceptions. devlink intentionally filtered control
packets and did not pass them to drop monitor as they were not dropped
by the underlying hardware.

Now drop monitor registers its probe on a generic 'devlink_trap_report'
tracepoint and should therefore perform this filtering itself instead of
having devlink do that.

Add the trap type as metadata and have drop monitor ignore control
packets.
