ASoC/soundwire: bus: use property to set interrupt masks

Add a slave-level property and program the SCP_INT1_MASK as desired by
the codec driver. Since there is no DisCo property this has to be an
implementation-specific firmware property or hard-coded in the driver.

The only functionality change is that implementation-defined
interrupts are no longer set for amplifiers - those interrupts are
typically for jack detection or acoustic event detection/hotwording.
