ASoC: qcom: Fix enabling BCLK and LRCLK in LPAIF invalid state

Fix enabling BCLK and LRCLK only when LPAIF is invalid state and
bit clock in enable state.
In device suspend/resume scenario LPAIF is going to reset state.
which is causing LRCLK disable and BCLK enable.
Avoid such inconsitency by removing unnecessary cpu dai prepare API,
which is doing LRCLK enable, and by maintaining BLCK  state information.
