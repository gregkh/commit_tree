iommu/amd: Re-purpose Exclusion range registers to support SNP CWWB

When the IOMMU SNP support bit is set in the IOMMU Extended Features
register, hardware re-purposes the following registers:

1. IOMMU Exclusion Base register (MMIO offset 0020h) to
   Completion Wait Write-Back (CWWB) Base register

2. IOMMU Exclusion Range Limit (MMIO offset 0028h) to
   Completion Wait Write-Back (CWWB) Range Limit register

and requires the IOMMU CWWB semaphore base and range to be programmed
in the register offset 0020h and 0028h accordingly.
