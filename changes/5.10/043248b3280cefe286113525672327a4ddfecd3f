KVM: VMX: Forbid userspace MSR filters for x2APIC

Allowing userspace to intercept reads to x2APIC MSRs when APICV is
fully enabled for the guest simply can't work.   But more in general,
the LAPIC could be set to in-kernel after the MSR filter is setup
and allowing accesses by userspace would be very confusing.

We could in principle allow userspace to intercept reads and writes to TPR,
and writes to EOI and SELF_IPI, but while that could be made it work, it
would still be silly.
