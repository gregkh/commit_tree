MIPS: cpu-probe: Set Ingenic's writecombine to _CACHE_CACHABLE_WA

Previously, in cpu_probe_ingenic(), c->writecombine was set to
_CACHE_UNCACHED_ACCELERATED, but this macro was defined differently when
CONFIG_MACH_INGENIC was set. This made it impossible to support multiple
CPUs.

Address this issue by setting c->writecombine to _CACHE_CACHABLE_WA
directly and removing the dependency on CONFIG_MACH_INGENIC.
