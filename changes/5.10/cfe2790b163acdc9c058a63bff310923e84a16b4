printk: move printk_info into separate array

The majority of the size of a descriptor is taken up by meta data,
which is often not of interest to the ringbuffer (for example,
when performing state checks). Since descriptors are often
temporarily stored on the stack, keeping their size minimal will
help reduce stack pressure.

Rather than embedding the printk_info into the descriptor, create
a separate printk_info array. The index of a descriptor in the
descriptor array corresponds to the printk_info with the same
index in the printk_info array. The rules for validity of a
printk_info match the existing rules for the data blocks: the
descriptor must be in a consistent state.
