bpf: Enable BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN for raw_tracepoint

Add .test_run for raw_tracepoint. Also, introduce a new feature that runs
the target program on a specific CPU. This is achieved by a new flag in
bpf_attr.test, BPF_F_TEST_RUN_ON_CPU. When this flag is set, the program
is triggered on cpu with id bpf_attr.test.cpu. This feature is needed for
BPF programs that handle perf_event and other percpu resources, as the
program can access these resource locally.
