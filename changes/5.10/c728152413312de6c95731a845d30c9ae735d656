blk-mq: get rid of the dead flush handle code path

After commit 923218f6166a ("blk-mq: don't allocate driver tag upfront
for flush rq"), blk_mq_submit_bio() will call blk_insert_flush()
directly to handle flush request rather than blk_mq_sched_insert_request()
in the case of elevator.

Then, all flush request either have set RQF_FLUSH_SEQ flag when call
blk_mq_sched_insert_request(), or have inserted into hctx->dispatch.
So, remove the dead code path.
