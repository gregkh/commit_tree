blk-iocost: rename propagate_active_weights() to propagate_weights()

It already propagates two weights - active and inuse - and there will be
another soon. Let's drop the confusing misnomers. Rename
[__]propagate_active_weights() to [__]propagate_weights() and
commit_active_weights() to commit_weights().

This is pure rename.
