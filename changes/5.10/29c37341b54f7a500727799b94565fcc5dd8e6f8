clk: ingenic: Use to_clk_info() macro for all clocks

The to_clk_info() previously had a BUG_ON() to check that it was only
called for PLL clocks. Yet, all the other clocks were doing the exact
same thing the macro does, in-line.

Move the to_clk_info() macro to the top of the file, remove the
hardcoded BUG_ON(), and use it everywhere it makes sense.
