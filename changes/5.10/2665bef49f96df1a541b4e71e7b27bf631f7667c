vc_screen: sanitize types in vcs_write

* ret can carry error codes, so make it signed, i.e. ssize_t
* pos is derived from the passed ppos, so make it long enough, i.e.
  loff_t
* attr is a boolean, so...
* size is limited by vcs_size() which returns an int
* written, p, orig_count and this_round are always ">= 0" and "< size",
  so uint is enough
* col and max_col are derived from vc->vc_cols (uint) and p, so make
  them uint too
* place con_buf0 and con_buf declaration to a single line
