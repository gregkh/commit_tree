fscrypt: fix inline encryption not used on new files

The new helper function fscrypt_prepare_new_inode() runs before
S_ENCRYPTED has been set on the new inode.  This accidentally made
fscrypt_select_encryption_impl() never enable inline encryption on newly
created files, due to its use of fscrypt_needs_contents_encryption()
which only returns true when S_ENCRYPTED is set.

Fix this by using S_ISREG() directly instead of
fscrypt_needs_contents_encryption(), analogous to what
select_encryption_mode() does.

I didn't notice this earlier because by design, the user-visible
behavior is the same (other than performance, potentially) regardless of
whether inline encryption is used or not.
