ASoC: Intel: Remove unused DSP operations

sound/soc/intel/common/ declares several helper functions for /intel/
solutions. In practice, differences between these - /haswell/ and
/skylake/ especially - led to many of the helpers being used only by a
single solution. As /skylake/ makes no use of these and /haswell/ and
/baytail/ are no more, remove the unused functions.
