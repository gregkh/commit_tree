scsi: sym53c8xx_2: Fix sizeof() mismatch

An incorrect sizeof() is being used, struct sym_ccb ** is not correct, it
should be struct sym_ccb *. Note that since ** is the same size as * this
is not causing any issues.  Improve this fix by using the idiom
sizeof(*np->ccbh) as this allows one to not even reference the type of the
pointer.

  tglx/history repo ]
