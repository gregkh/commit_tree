drm/amdgpu: Prevent kernel-infoleak in amdgpu_info_ioctl()

Compiler leaves a 4-byte hole near the end of `dev_info`, causing
amdgpu_info_ioctl() to copy uninitialized kernel stack memory to userspace
when `size` is greater than 356.

In 2015 we tried to fix this issue by doing `= {};` on `dev_info`, which
unfortunately does not initialize that 4-byte hole. Fix it by using
memset() instead.
