perf streams: Compare two streams

Stream is the branch history which is aggregated by the branch records
from perf samples. Now we support the callchain as stream.

If the callchain entries of one stream are fully matched with the
callchain entries of another stream, we think two streams are matched.

For example,

   cycles: 1, hits: 26.80%                 cycles: 1, hits: 27.30%
   -----------------------                 -----------------------
             main div.c:39                           main div.c:39
             main div.c:44                           main div.c:44

Above two streams are matched (we don't consider the case that source
code is changed).

The matching logic is, compare the chain string first. If it's not
matched, fallback to dso address comparison.
