p54: avoid accessing the data mapped to streaming DMA

In p54p_tx(), skb->data is mapped to streaming DMA on line 337:
  mapping = pci_map_single(..., skb->data, ...);

Then skb->data is accessed on line 349:
  desc->device_addr = ((struct p54_hdr *)skb->data)->req_id;

This access may cause data inconsistency between CPU cache and hardware.

To fix this problem, ((struct p54_hdr *)skb->data)->req_id is stored in
a local variable before DMA mapping, and then the driver accesses this
local variable instead of skb->data.
