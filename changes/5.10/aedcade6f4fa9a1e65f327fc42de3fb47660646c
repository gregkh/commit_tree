debugobjects: Allow debug_obj_descr to be const

The debugobject core could be slightly harder to corrupt if the
debug_obj_descr would be a pointer to const memory.

Depending on the architecture, const data structures are placed into
read-only memory and thus are harder to corrupt or hijack.

This descriptor is used to fix up stuff like timers and workqueues when
core kernel data structures are busted, so moving the descriptors to
read-only memory will make debugobjects more resilient to something going
wrong and then corrupting the function pointers inside struct
debug_obj_descr.
