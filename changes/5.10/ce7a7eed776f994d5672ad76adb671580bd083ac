doc: seq_file: clarify role of *pos in ->next()

There are behavioural requirements on the seq_file next() function in
terms of how it updates *pos at end-of-file, and these are now enforced
by a warning.

I was recently attempting to justify the reason this was needed, and
couldn't remember the details, and didn't find them in the
documentation.

So I re-read the code until I understood it again, and updated the
documentation to match.

I also enhanced the text about SEQ_START_TOKEN as it seemed potentially
misleading.
