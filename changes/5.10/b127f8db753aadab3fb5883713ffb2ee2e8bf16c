media: exynos4-is: Correct missing entity function initialization

Commit bae4500399c4 ("[media] exynos4-is: Add missing entity function
initialization") tried to suppress the warnings such as

s5p-fimc-md camera: Entity type for entity FIMC.0 was not initialized!

However, this missed setting for the subdev.  Set it now to avoid the
ugly warnings on boot.
