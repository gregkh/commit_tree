dpaa2-eth: add a dpaa2_eth_ prefix to all functions in dpaa2-eth.c

Some static functions in the dpaa2-eth driver don't have the dpaa2_eth_
prefix and this is becoming an inconvenience when looking at, for
example, a perf top output and trying to determine easily which entries
are dpaa2-eth related. Ammend this by adding the prefix to all the
functions.
