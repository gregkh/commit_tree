printk: ringbuffer: support dataless records

With commit 896fbe20b4e2333fb55 ("printk: use the lockless ringbuffer"),
printk() started silently dropping messages without text because such
records are not supported by the new printk ringbuffer.

Add support for such records.

Currently dataless records are denoted by INVALID_LPOS in order
to recognize failed prb_reserve() calls. Change the ringbuffer
to instead use two different identifiers (FAILED_LPOS and
NO_LPOS) to distinguish between failed prb_reserve() records and
successful dataless records, respectively.
