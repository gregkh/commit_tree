virtiofs: implement dax read/write operations

This patch implements basic DAX support. mmap() is not implemented
yet and will come in later patches. This patch looks into implemeting
read/write.

We make use of interval tree to keep track of per inode dax mappings.

Do not use dax for file extending writes, instead just send WRITE message
to daemon (like we do for direct I/O path). This will keep write and
i_size change atomic w.r.t crash.
