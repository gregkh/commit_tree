ASoC: tas2770: Fix calling reset in probe

tas2770_reset is called during i2c probe. The reset calls the
snd_soc_component_write which depends on the tas2770->component being
available. The component pointer is not set until codec_probe so move
the reset to the codec_probe after the pointer is set.
