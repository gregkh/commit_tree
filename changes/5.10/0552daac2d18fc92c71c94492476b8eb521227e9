drm: prime: use sgtable iterators in drm_prime_sg_to_page_addr_arrays()

Replace the current hand-crafted code for extracting pages and DMA
addresses from the given scatterlist by the much more robust
code based on the generic scatterlist iterators and recently
introduced sg_table-based wrappers. The resulting code is simple and
easy to understand, so the comment describing the old code is no
longer needed.
