ovl: support [S|G]ETFLAGS and FS[S|G]ETXATTR ioctls for directories

[S|G]ETFLAGS and FS[S|G]ETXATTR ioctls are applicable to both files and
directories, so add ioctl operations to dir as well.

We teach ovl_real_fdget() to get the realfile of directories which use
a different type of file->private_data.

Ifdef away compat ioctl implementation to conform to standard practice.

With this change, xfstest generic/079 which tests these ioctls on files
and directories passes.
