can: m_can: process interrupt only when not runtime suspended

Avoid processing bogus interrupt statuses when the HW is runtime suspended and
the M_CAN_IR register read may get all bits 1's. Handler can be called if the
interrupt request is shared with other peripherals or at the end of free_irq().

Therefore check the runtime suspended status before processing.
