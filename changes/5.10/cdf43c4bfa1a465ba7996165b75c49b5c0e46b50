bpf, selftests: Add option to test_sockmap to omit adding parser program

Add option to allow running without a parser program in place. To test
with ping/pong program use,

 # test_sockmap -t ping --txmsg_omit_skb_parser

this will send packets between two socket bouncing through a proxy
socket that does not use a parser program.
