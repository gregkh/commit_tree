x86/kaslr: Drop unnecessary alignment in find_random_virt_addr()

Drop unnecessary alignment of image_size to CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN in
find_random_virt_addr, it cannot change the result: the largest valid
slot is the largest n that satisfies

  minimum + n * CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN + image_size <= KERNEL_IMAGE_SIZE

(since minimum is already aligned) and so n is equal to

  (KERNEL_IMAGE_SIZE - minimum - image_size) / CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN

even if image_size is not aligned to CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN.
