USB: Add NO_LPM quirk for Kingston flash drive

In Bugzilla #208257, Julien Humbert reports that a 32-GB Kingston
flash drive spontaneously disconnects and reconnects, over and over.
Testing revealed that disabling Link Power Management for the drive
fixed the problem.

This patch adds a quirk entry for that drive to turn off LPM permanently.
