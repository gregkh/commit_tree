mmc: tmio: improve bringing HW to a sane state with MMC_POWER_OFF

Further testing of error cases revealed that downgrade is not enough, so
we need to reset the SCC which is done by calling the custom reset
function. This reset function can distinguish between the various SDHI
variants, so protecting the call with MIN_RCAR2 is enough here.
