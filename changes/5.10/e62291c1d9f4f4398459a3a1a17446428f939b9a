crypto: marvell/cesa - Fix sparse warnings

This patch fixes most sparse warnings in the cesa driver.  The only
ones remaining are to do with copying data between iomem pointers and
SG lists.

Most changes are trivial.  The following are the noteworthy ones:

- Removal of swab in mv_cesa_aes_setkey.  This appears to be bogus
as everything gets swabbed again later on so for BE this ends up
being different from LE.  The change takes the LE behaviour as the
correct one.

- next_dma in mv_cesa_tdma_chain was not swabbed.
