x86/debug: Remove the historical junk

Remove the historical junk and replace it with a WARN and a comment.

The problem is that even though the kernel only uses TF single-step in
kprobes and KGDB, both of which consume the event before this, QEMU/KVM has
bugs in this area that can trigger this state so it has to be dealt with.
