drm/amd/display: allow DP RX to use more cr aux rd interval delay

[why]
Regression is caused by previous change with attempt to correct the
extended cr aux rd interval delay due to mis interpretation of the DP specs.
The change turns out not working well with certain RXs.
So we decided to keep the cr aux rd interval logic as before.
