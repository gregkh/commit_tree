bpf: selftests: Tcp header options

This patch adds tests for the new bpf tcp header option feature.

test_tcp_hdr_options.c:
- It tests header option writing and parsing in 3WHS: regular
  connection establishment, fastopen, and syncookie.
- In syncookie, the passive side's bpf prog is asking the active side
  to resend its bpf header option by specifying a RESEND bit in the
  outgoing SYNACK. handle_active_estab() and write_nodata_opt() has
  some details.
- handle_passive_estab() has comments on fastopen.
- It also has test for header writing and parsing in FIN packet.
- Most of the tests is writing an experimental option 254 with magic 0xeB9F.
- The no_exprm_estab() also tests writing a regular TCP option
  without any magic.

test_misc_tcp_options.c:
- It is an one directional test.  Active side writes option and
  passive side parses option.  The focus is to exercise
  the new helpers and API.
- Testing the new helper: bpf_load_hdr_opt() and bpf_store_hdr_opt().
- Testing the bpf_getsockopt(TCP_BPF_SYN).
- Negative tests for the above helpers.
- Testing the sock_ops->skb_data.
