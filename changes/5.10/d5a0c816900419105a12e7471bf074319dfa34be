drm: mxsfb: check framebuffer pitch

The lcdif IP does not support a framebuffer pitch (stride) other than
framebuffer width. Check for equality and reject the framebuffer
otherwise.

This prevents a distorted picture when using 640x800 and running the
Mesa graphics stack. Mesa tries to use a cache aligned stride, which
leads at that particular resolution to width != stride. Currently
Mesa has no fallback behavior, but rejecting this configuration allows
userspace to handle the issue correctly.
