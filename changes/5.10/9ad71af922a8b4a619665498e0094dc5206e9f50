sound: 6fire: move to use usb_control_msg_send() and usb_control_msg_recv()

The usb_control_msg_send() and usb_control_msg_recv() calls can return
an error if a "short" write/read happens, so move the driver over to
using those calls instead, saving some logic in the wrapper functions
that were being used in this driver.

This also resolves a long-staging bug where data on the stack was being
sent in a USB control message, which was not allowed.

v2: API change of usb_control_msg_send()
