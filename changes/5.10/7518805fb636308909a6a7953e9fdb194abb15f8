ASoC: sun8i-codec: Add a quirk for LRCK inversion

On the A64, as tested using the PinePhone, the current code causes the
left/right channels to be swapped during I2S playback from the CPU on
AIF1, and breaks DSP_A communication with the modem on AIF2. Both of
these are fixed when LRCK is no longer inverted.

Trusting that the comment in the code is correct, the existing behavior
is kept for the A33.
