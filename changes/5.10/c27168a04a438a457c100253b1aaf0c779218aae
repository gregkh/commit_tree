HID: logitech-hidpp: Add HIDPP_CONSUMER_VENDOR_KEYS quirk for the Dinovo Edge

Like the MX5000 and MX5500 quad/bluetooth keyboards the Dinovo Edge also
needs the HIDPP_CONSUMER_VENDOR_KEYS quirk for some special keys to work.
Specifically without this the "Phone" and the 'A' - 'D' Smart Keys do not
send any events.

In addition to fixing these keys not sending any events, adding the
Bluetooth match, so that hid-logitech-hidpp is used instead of the
generic HID driver, also adds battery monitoring support when the
keyboard is connected over Bluetooth.
