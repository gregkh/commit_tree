tools/bpftool: Remove libbpf_internal.h usage in bpftool

Most netlink-related functions were unique to bpftool usage, so I moved them
into net.c. Few functions are still used by both bpftool and libbpf itself
internally, so I've copy-pasted them (libbpf_nl_get_link,
libbpf_netlink_open). It's a bit of duplication of code, but better separation
of libbpf as a library with public API and bpftool, relying on unexposed
functions in libbpf.
