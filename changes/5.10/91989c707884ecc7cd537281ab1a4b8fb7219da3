task_work: cleanup notification modes

A previous commit changed the notification mode from true/false to an
int, allowing notify-no, notify-yes, or signal-notify. This was
backwards compatible in the sense that any existing true/false user
would translate to either 0 (on notification sent) or 1, the latter
which mapped to TWA_RESUME. TWA_SIGNAL was assigned a value of 2.

Clean this up properly, and define a proper enum for the notification
mode. Now we have:

- TWA_NONE. This is 0, same as before the original change, meaning no
  notification requested.
- TWA_RESUME. This is 1, same as before the original change, meaning
  that we use TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME.
- TWA_SIGNAL. This uses TIF_SIGPENDING/JOBCTL_TASK_WORK for the
  notification.

Clean up all the callers, switching their 0/1/false/true to using the
appropriate TWA_* mode for notifications.
