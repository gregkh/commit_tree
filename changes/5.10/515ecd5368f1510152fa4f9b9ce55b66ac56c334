vfio/pci: Decouple PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY bit checks from is_virtfn

While it is true that devices with is_virtfn=1 will have a Memory Space
Enable bit that is hard-wired to 0, this is not the only case where we
see this behavior -- For example some bare-metal hypervisors lack
Memory Space Enable bit emulation for devices not setting is_virtfn
(s390). Fix this by instead checking for the newly-added
no_command_memory bit which directly denotes the need for
PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY emulation in vfio.
