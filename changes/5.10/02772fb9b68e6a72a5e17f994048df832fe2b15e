x86/sev-es: Allocate and map an IST stack for #VC handler

Allocate and map an IST stack and an additional fall-back stack for
the #VC handler.  The memory for the stacks is allocated only when
SEV-ES is active.

The #VC handler needs to use an IST stack because a #VC exception can be
raised from kernel space with unsafe stack, e.g. in the SYSCALL entry
path.

Since the #VC exception can be nested, the #VC handler switches back to
the interrupted stack when entered from kernel space. If switching back
is not possible, the fall-back stack is used.
