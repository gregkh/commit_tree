iwlwifi: mvm: don't send a CSA command the firmware doesn't know

We introduced a new flow to remove an on-going CSA but we
assumed the firwmare understands the
CHANNEL_SWITCH_TIME_EVENT_CMD. This is not true for 7265 and down.

Don't send this command for those devices, but rather use the older
command.
