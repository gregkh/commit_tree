powerpc: Warn about use of smt_snooze_delay

It's not done anything for a long time. Save the percpu variable, and
emit a warning to remind users to not expect it to do anything.

This uses pr_warn_once instead of pr_warn_ratelimit as testing
'ppc64_cpu --smt=off' on a 24 core / 4 SMT system showed the warning
to be noisy, as the online/offline loop is slow.
