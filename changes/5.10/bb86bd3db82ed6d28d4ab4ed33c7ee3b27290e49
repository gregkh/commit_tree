btrfs: don't force commit if we are data

We used to unconditionally commit the transaction at least 2 times and
then on the 3rd try check against pinned space to make sure committing
the transaction was worth the effort.  This is overkill, we know nobody
is going to steal our reservation, and if we can't make our reservation
with the pinned amount simply bail out.

This also cleans up the passing of bytes_needed to
may_commit_transaction, as that was the thing we added into place in
order to accomplish this behavior.  We no longer need it so remove that
mess.
