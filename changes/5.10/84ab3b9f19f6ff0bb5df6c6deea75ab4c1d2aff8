ASoC: q6dsp: q6afe: update q6afe_set_param to support global clocks

Previously there was no case where we need to set clock or send commands
that are not associated with q6afe ports, now we have cases like clock
voting and clock consumers like codecs that needed these clocks.

update q6afe_set_param() to support such cases, including token passing.
