drivers: optee: allow op-tee to access devices on the i2c bus

Some secure elements like NXP's SE050 sit on I2C buses. For OP-TEE to
control this type of cryptographic devices it needs coordinated access
to the bus, so collisions and RUNTIME_PM dont get in the way.

This trampoline driver allow OP-TEE to access them.
