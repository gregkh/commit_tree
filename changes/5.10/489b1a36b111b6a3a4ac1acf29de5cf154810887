staging: mfd: hi6421-spmi-pmic: get rid of unused code

There are some checks there which could make sense for
downstream builds, but doesn't make much sense for
upstream ones. They came from the official Hikey970 tree
from Linaro, but even there, the commented-out code is not
set via other Kconfig vars.

So, let's just get rid of that. If needed later, this
patch can be (partially?) reversed.
