net/mlx5e: Support CT offload for tc nic flows

Adding support to perform CT related tc actions and
matching on CT states for nic flows.

The ct flows management and handling will be done using a new
instance of the ct database that is declared in this patch to
keep it separate from the eswitch ct flows database.
Offloading and unoffloading ct flows will be done using the
existing ct offload api by providing it the relevant ct
database reference in each mode.

In addition, refactoring the tc ct api is introduced to make it
agnostic to the flow type and perform the resource allocations
and rule insertion to the proper steering domain in the device.

In the initialization call, the api requests and stores in the ct
database instance all the relevant information that distinguishes
between nic flows and esw flows, such as chains database, steering
namespace and mod hdr table.
This way the operations of adding and removing ct flows to the device
can later performed agnostically to the flow type.
