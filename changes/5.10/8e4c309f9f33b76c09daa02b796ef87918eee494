ata: sata_nv: Fix retrieving of active qcs

ata_qc_complete_multiple() has to be called with the tags physically
active, that is the hw tag is at bit 0. ap->qc_active has the same tag
at bit ATA_TAG_INTERNAL instead, so call ata_qc_get_active() to fix that
up. This is done in the vein of 8385d756e114 ("libata: Fix retrieving of
active qcs").

Fixes: 28361c403683 ("libata: add extra internal command")
