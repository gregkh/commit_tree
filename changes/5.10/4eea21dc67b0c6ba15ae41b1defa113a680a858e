usb: gadget: u_ether: enable qmult on SuperSpeed Plus as well

The u_ether driver has a qmult setting that multiplies the
transmit queue length (which by default is 2).

The intent is that it should be enabled at high/super speed, but
because the code does not explicitly check for USB_SUPER_PLUS,
it is disabled at that speed.

Fix this by ensuring that the queue multiplier is enabled for any
wired link at high speed or above. Using >= for USB_SPEED_*
constants seems correct because it is what the gadget_is_xxxspeed
functions do.

The queue multiplier substantially helps performance at higher
speeds. On a direct SuperSpeed Plus link to a Linux laptop,
iperf3 single TCP stream:

Before (qmult=1): 1.3 Gbps
After  (qmult=5): 3.2 Gbps
