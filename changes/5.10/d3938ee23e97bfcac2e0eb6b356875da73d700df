erofs: derive atime instead of leaving it empty

EROFS has _only one_ ondisk timestamp (ctime is currently
documented and recorded, we might also record mtime instead
with a new compat feature if needed) for each extended inode
since EROFS isn't mainly for archival purposes so no need to
keep all timestamps on disk especially for Android scenarios
due to security concerns. Also, romfs/cramfs don't have their
own on-disk timestamp, and squashfs only records mtime instead.

Let's also derive access time from ondisk timestamp rather than
leaving it empty, and if mtime/atime for each file are really
needed for specific scenarios as well, we can also use xattrs
to record them then.
