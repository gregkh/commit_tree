powerpc/pseries/iommu: Allow bigger 64bit window by removing default DMA window

On LoPAR "DMA Window Manipulation Calls", it's recommended to remove the
default DMA window for the device, before attempting to configure a DDW,
in order to make the maximum resources available for the next DDW to be
created.

This is a requirement for using DDW on devices in which hypervisor
allows only one DMA window.

If setting up a new DDW fails anywhere after the removal of this
default DMA window, it's needed to restore the default DMA window.
For this, an implementation of ibm,reset-pe-dma-windows rtas call is
needed:

Platforms supporting the DDW option starting with LoPAR level 2.7 implement
ibm,ddw-extensions. The first extension available (index 2) carries the
token for ibm,reset-pe-dma-windows rtas call, which is used to restore
the default DMA window for a device, if it has been deleted.

It does so by resetting the TCE table allocation for the PE to it's
boot time value, available in "ibm,dma-window" device tree node.
