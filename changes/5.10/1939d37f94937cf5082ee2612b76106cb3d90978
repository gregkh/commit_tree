arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-som-p0: Add DDR carveout memory nodes for C71x DSP

Two carveout reserved memory nodes have been added for the lone C71x DSP
remote processor device present within the MAIN voltage domain for the TI
J721E EVM boards. These nodes are assigned to the respective rproc device
node as well. The first region will be used as the DMA pool for the rproc
device, and the second region will furnish the static carveout regions for
the firmware memory.

The current carveout addresses and sizes are defined statically for each
device. The C71x DSP processor does support a MMU called CMMU, but is not
currently supported and as such requires the exact memory used by the
firmware to be set-aside. The firmware images currently do not need any
RSC_CARVEOUT entries either in their resource tables to allocate the
memory for firmware memory segments.

The reserved memory nodes can be disabled later on if there is no use-case
defined to use the C71x DSP remoteproc processor.
