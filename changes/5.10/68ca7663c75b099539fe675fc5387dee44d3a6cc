KVM: LAPIC: Narrow down the kick target vCPU

The kick after setting KVM_REQ_PENDING_TIMER is used to handle the timer
fires on a different pCPU which vCPU is running on.  This kick costs about
1000 clock cycles and we don't need this when injecting already-expired
timer or when using the VMX preemption timer because
kvm_lapic_expired_hv_timer() is called from the target vCPU.
