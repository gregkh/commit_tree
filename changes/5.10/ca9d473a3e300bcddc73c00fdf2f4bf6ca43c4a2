btrfs: use BTRFS_NESTED_NEW_ROOT for double splits

I've made this change separate since it requires both of the newly added
NESTED flags and I didn't want to slip it into one of those changes.

If we do a double split of a node we can end up doing a
BTRFS_NESTED_SPLIT on level 0, which throws lockdep off because it
appears as a double lock.  Since we're maxed out on subclasses, use
BTRFS_NESTED_NEW_ROOT if we had to do a double split.  This is OK
because we won't have to do a double split if we had to insert a new
root, and the new root would be at a higher level anyway.
