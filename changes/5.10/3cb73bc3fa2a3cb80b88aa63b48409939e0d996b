hyperv_fb: Update screen_info after removing old framebuffer

On gen2 HyperV VM, hyperv_fb will remove the old framebuffer, and the
new allocated framebuffer address could be at a differnt location,
and it might be no longer a VGA framebuffer.

Update screen_info so that after kexec the kernel won't try to reuse
the old invalid/stale framebuffer address as VGA, corrupting memory.
