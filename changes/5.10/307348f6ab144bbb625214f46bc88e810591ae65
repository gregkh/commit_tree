scsi: ufs: Abort tasks before clearing them from doorbell

To recover non-fatal errors, no full reset is required, err_handler only
clears those pending TRs/TMRs so that SCSI layer can re-issue them. In
current err_handler, TRs are directly cleared from UFS host's doorbell but
not aborted from device side. However, according to the UFSHCI JEDEC spec,
the host software shall use UTP Transfer Request List Clear Register to
clear a task from UFS host's doorbell only when a UTP Transfer Request is
expected to not be completed, e.g. when the host software receives a
“FUNCTION COMPLETE” Task Management response which means a Transfer Request
was aborted. To follow the UFSHCI JEDEC spec, in err_handler, abort one TR
before clearing it from doorbell.
