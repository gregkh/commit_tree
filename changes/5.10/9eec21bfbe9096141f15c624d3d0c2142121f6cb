smb3: add dynamic trace point to trace when credits obtained

SMB3 crediting is used for flow control, and it can be useful to
trace for problem determination how many credits were acquired
and for which operation.

Here is an example ("trace-cmd record -e *add_credits"):
cifsd-9522    [010] ....  5995.202712: smb3_add_credits:
	server=localhost current_mid=0x12 credits=373 credits_to_add=10
cifsd-9522    [010] ....  5995.204040: smb3_add_credits:
	server=localhost current_mid=0x15 credits=400 credits_to_add=30
