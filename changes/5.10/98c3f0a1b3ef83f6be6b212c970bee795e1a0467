ARM: config: aspeed: Fix selection of media drivers

In the 5.7 merge window the media kconfig was restructued. For most
platforms these changes set CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT_FILTER=y which keeps
unwanted drivers disabled.

The exception is if a config sets EMBEDDED or EXPERT (see b0cd4fb27665).
In that case the filter is set to =n, causing a bunch of DVB tuner drivers
(MEDIA_TUNER_*) to be accidentally enabled. This was noticed as it blew
out the build time for the Aspeed defconfigs.

Enabling the filter means the Aspeed config also needs to set
CONFIG_MEDIA_PLATFORM_SUPPORT=y in order to have the CONFIG_VIDEO_ASPEED
driver enabled.

Fixes: 06b93644f4d1 ("media: Kconfig: add an option to filter in/out platform drivers")
Fixes: b0cd4fb27665 ("media: Kconfig: on !EMBEDDED && !EXPERT, enable driver filtering")
