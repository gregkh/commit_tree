arm64: stacktrace: Convert to ARCH_STACKWALK

Historically architectures have had duplicated code in their stack trace
implementations for filtering what gets traced. In order to avoid this
duplication some generic code has been provided using a new interface
arch_stack_walk(), enabled by selecting ARCH_STACKWALK in Kconfig, which
factors all this out into the generic stack trace code. Convert arm64
to use this common infrastructure.
