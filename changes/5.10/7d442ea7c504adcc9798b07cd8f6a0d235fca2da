drm/i915: Cancel outstanding work after disabling heartbeats on an engine

We only allow persistent requests to remain on the GPU past the closure
of their containing context (and process) so long as they are continuously
checked for hangs or allow other requests to preempt them, as we need to
ensure forward progress of the system. If we allow persistent contexts
to remain on the system after the the hangcheck mechanism is disabled,
the system may grind to a halt. On disabling the mechanism, we sent a
pulse along the engine to remove all executing contexts from the engine
which would check for hung contexts -- but we did not prevent those
contexts from being resubmitted if they survived the final hangcheck.
