xfs: xfs_iflock is no longer a completion

With the recent rework of the inode cluster flushing, we no longer
ever wait on the the inode flush "lock". It was never a lock in the
first place, just a completion to allow callers to wait for inode IO
to complete. We now never wait for flush completion as all inode
flushing is non-blocking. Hence we can get rid of all the iflock
infrastructure and instead just set and check a state flag.

Rename the XFS_IFLOCK flag to XFS_IFLUSHING, convert all the
xfs_iflock_nowait() test-and-set operations on that flag, and
replace all the xfs_ifunlock() calls to clear operations.
