ASoC: Intel: soc-acpi: mirror CML and TGL configurations

Some TGL devices use the same audio hardware as on CML platforms, with
RT711 on link0, RT1308 on link1 and optionally link2, and RT715 on
link 3.

To clarify configurations, the rt1308 configurations are split between
single amp on link1 and dual amps on link1. The case with two amps on
different links is already identified with the group1 attribute.
