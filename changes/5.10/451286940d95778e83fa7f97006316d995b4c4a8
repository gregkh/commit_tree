x86/kaslr: Initialize mem_limit to the real maximum address

On 64-bit, the kernel must be placed below MAXMEM (64TiB with 4-level
paging or 4PiB with 5-level paging). This is currently not enforced by
KASLR, which thus implicitly relies on physical memory being limited to
less than 64TiB.

On 32-bit, the limit is KERNEL_IMAGE_SIZE (512MiB). This is enforced by
special checks in __process_mem_region().

Initialize mem_limit to the maximum (depending on architecture), instead
of ULLONG_MAX, and make sure the command-line arguments can only
decrease it. This makes the enforcement explicit on 64-bit, and
eliminates the 32-bit specific checks to keep the kernel below 512M.

Check upfront to make sure the minimum address is below the limit before
doing any work.
