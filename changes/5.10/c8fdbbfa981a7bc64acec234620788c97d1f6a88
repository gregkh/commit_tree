perf: Add Arm CMN-600 DT binding

Document the requirements for the CMN-600 DT binding. The internal
topology is almost entirely discoverable by walking a tree of ID
registers, but sadly both the starting point for that walk and the
exact format of those registers are configuration-dependent and not
discoverable from some sane fixed location. Oh well.
