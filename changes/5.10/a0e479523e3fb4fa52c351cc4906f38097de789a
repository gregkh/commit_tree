KVM: arm64: Save chosen hyp vector to a percpu variable

Introduce a percpu variable to hold the address of the selected hyp
vector that will be used with guests. This avoids the selection process
each time a guest is being entered and can be used by nVHE when a
separate vector is introduced for the host.
