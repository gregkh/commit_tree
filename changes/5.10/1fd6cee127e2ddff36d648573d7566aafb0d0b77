libbpf: Fix VERSIONED_SYM_COUNT number parsing

We remove "other info" from "readelf -s --wide" output when
parsing GLOBAL_SYM_COUNT variable, which was added in [1].
But we don't do that for VERSIONED_SYM_COUNT and it's failing
the check_abi target on powerpc Fedora 33.

The extra "other info" wasn't problem for VERSIONED_SYM_COUNT
parsing until commit [2] added awk in the pipe, which assumes
that the last column is symbol, but it can be "other info".

Adding "other info" removal for VERSIONED_SYM_COUNT the same
way as we did for GLOBAL_SYM_COUNT parsing.
