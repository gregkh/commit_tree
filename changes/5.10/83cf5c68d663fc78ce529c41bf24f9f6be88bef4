xsk: Fix use-after-free in failed shared_umem bind

Fix use-after-free when a shared umem bind fails. The code incorrectly
tried to free the allocated buffer pool both in the bind code and then
later also when the socket was released. Fix this by setting the
buffer pool pointer to NULL after the bind code has freed the pool, so
that the socket release code will not try to free the pool. This is
the same solution as the regular, non-shared umem code path has. This
was missing from the shared umem path.
