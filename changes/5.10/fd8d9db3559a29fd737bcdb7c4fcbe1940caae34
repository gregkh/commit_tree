x86/resctrl: Remove superfluous kernfs_get() calls to prevent refcount leak

Willem reported growing of kernfs_node_cache entries in slabtop when
repeatedly creating and removing resctrl subdirectories as well as when
repeatedly mounting and unmounting the resctrl filesystem.

On resource group (control as well as monitoring) creation via a mkdir
an extra kernfs_node reference is obtained to ensure that the rdtgroup
structure remains accessible for the rdtgroup_kn_unlock() calls where it
is removed on deletion. The kernfs_node reference count is dropped by
kernfs_put() in rdtgroup_kn_unlock().

With the above explaining the need for one kernfs_get()/kernfs_put()
pair in resctrl there are more places where a kernfs_node reference is
obtained without a corresponding release. The excessive amount of
reference count on kernfs nodes will never be dropped to 0 and the
kernfs nodes will never be freed in the call paths of rmdir and umount.
It leads to reference count leak and kernfs_node_cache memory leak.

Remove the superfluous kernfs_get() calls and expand the existing
comments surrounding the remaining kernfs_get()/kernfs_put() pair that
remains in use.

Superfluous kernfs_get() calls are removed from two areas:

  (1) In call paths of mount and mkdir, when kernfs nodes for "info",
  "mon_groups" and "mon_data" directories and sub-directories are
  created, the reference count of newly created kernfs node is set to 1.
  But after kernfs_create_dir() returns, superfluous kernfs_get() are
  called to take an additional reference.

  (2) kernfs_get() calls in rmdir call paths.
