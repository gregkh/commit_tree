mm: don't panic when links can't be created in sysfs

At boot time, or when doing memory hot-add operations, if the links in
sysfs can't be created, the system is still able to run, so just report
the error in the kernel log rather than BUG_ON and potentially make system
unusable because the callpath can be called with locks held.

Since the number of memory blocks managed could be high, the messages are
rate limited.

As a consequence, link_mem_sections() has no status to report anymore.
