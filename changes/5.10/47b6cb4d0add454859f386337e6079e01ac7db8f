libbpf: Make kernel feature probing lazy

Turn libbpf's kernel feature probing into lazily-performed checks. This allows
to skip performing unnecessary feature checks, if a given BPF application
doesn't rely on a particular kernel feature. As we grow number of feature
probes, libbpf might perform less unnecessary syscalls and scale better with
number of feature probes long-term.

By decoupling feature checks from bpf_object, it's also possible to perform
feature probing from libbpf static helpers and low-level APIs, if necessary.
