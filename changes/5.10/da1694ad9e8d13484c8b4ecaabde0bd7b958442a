s390/mm,ptdump: hold cpa mutex while walking for kernel page table dump

This is currently only preventing that outdated information is
provided to user space. A concurrent split of huge/large pages does
modify the kernel page tables, however either the huge/large mapping
is reported or the split area is being walked.

This "fixes" also only a potential future bug, since split pages could
also be merged again if page permissions are the same for larger
memory areas.
