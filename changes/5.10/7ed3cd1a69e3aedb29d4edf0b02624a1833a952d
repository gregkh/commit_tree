iomap: Fix misplaced page flushing

If iomap_unshare_actor() unshares to an inline iomap, the page was
not being flushed.  block_write_end() and __iomap_write_end() already
contain flushes, so adding it to iomap_write_end_inline() seems like
the best place.  That means we can remove it from iomap_write_actor().
