powerpc/smp: Allocate cpumask only after searching thread group

If allocated earlier and the search fails, then cpu_l1_cache_map cpumask
is unnecessarily cleared. However cpu_l1_cache_map can be allocated /
cleared after we search thread group.

Please note CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is not set on Powerpc. Hence cpumask
allocated by zalloc_cpumask_var_node is never freed.
