media: mtk-cir: fix calculation of chk period

Since commit 528222d853f9 ("media: rc: harmonize infrared durations to
microseconds"), the calculation of the chk period is wrong. As a result,
all reported IR will have incorrect timings.

Now that the calculations are done in microseconds rather than nanoseconds,
we can fold the calculations in a simpler form with less rounding error.
