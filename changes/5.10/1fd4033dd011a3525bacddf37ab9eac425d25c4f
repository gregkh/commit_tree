btrfs: rename BTRFS_INODE_ORDERED_DATA_CLOSE flag

Commit 8d875f95da43 ("btrfs: disable strict file flushes for
renames and truncates") eliminated the notion of ordered operations and
instead BTRFS_INODE_ORDERED_DATA_CLOSE only remained as a flag
indicating that a file's content should be synced to disk in case a
file is truncated and any writes happen to it concurrently. In fact
this intendend behavior was broken until it was fixed in
f6dc45c7a93a ("Btrfs: fix filemap_flush call in btrfs_file_release").

All things considered let's give the flag a more descriptive name. Also
slightly reword comments.
