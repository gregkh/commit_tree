KVM: arm64: Allow setting of ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.CSV2 from userspace

We now expose ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.CSV2=1 to guests running on hosts
that are immune to Spectre-v2, but that don't have this field set,
most likely because they predate the specification.

However, this prevents the migration of guests that have started on
a host the doesn't fake this CSV2 setting to one that does, as KVM
rejects the write to ID_AA64PFR0_EL2 on the grounds that it isn't
what is already there.

In order to fix this, allow userspace to set this field as long as
this doesn't result in a promising more than what is already there
(setting CSV2 to 0 is acceptable, but setting it to 1 when it is
already set to 0 isn't).
