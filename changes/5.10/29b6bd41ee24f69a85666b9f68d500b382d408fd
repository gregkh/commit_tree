x86/resctrl: Enable user to view thread or core throttling mode

Early Intel hardware implementations of Memory Bandwidth Allocation (MBA)
could only control bandwidth at the processor core level. This meant that
when two processes with different bandwidth allocations ran simultaneously
on the same core the hardware had to resolve this difference. It did so by
applying the higher throttling value (lower bandwidth) to both processes.

Newer implementations can apply different throttling values to each
thread on a core.

Introduce a new resctrl file, "thread_throttle_mode", on Intel systems
that shows to the user how throttling values are allocated, per-core or
per-thread.

On systems that support per-core throttling, the file will display "max".
On newer systems that support per-thread throttling, the file will display
"per-thread".

AMD confirmed in [1] that AMD bandwidth allocation is already at thread
level but that the AMD implementation does not use a memory delay
throttle mode. So to avoid confusion the thread throttling mode would be
UNDEFINED on AMD systems and the "thread_throttle_mode" file will not be
visible.
