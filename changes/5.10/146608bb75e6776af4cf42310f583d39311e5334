mm/gup: protect unpin_user_pages() against npages==-ERRNO

As suggested by Dan Carpenter, fortify unpin_user_pages() just a bit,
against a typical caller mistake: check if the npages arg is really a
-ERRNO value, which would blow up the unpinning loop: WARN and return.

If this new WARN_ON() fires, then the system *might* be leaking pages (by
leaving them pinned), but probably not.  More likely, gup/pup returned a
hard -ERRNO error to the caller, who erroneously passed it here.
