arm64/cpuinfo: Define HWCAP name arrays per their actual bit definitions

HWCAP name arrays (hwcap_str, compat_hwcap_str, compat_hwcap2_str) that are
scanned for /proc/cpuinfo are detached from their bit definitions making it
vulnerable and difficult to correlate. It is also bit problematic because
during /proc/cpuinfo dump these arrays get traversed sequentially assuming
they reflect and match actual HWCAP bit sequence, to test various features
for a given CPU. This redefines name arrays per their HWCAP bit definitions
. It also warns after detecting any feature which is not expected on arm64.
