s390/stp: add locking to sysfs functions

The sysfs function might race with stp_work_fn. To prevent that,
add the required locking. Another issue is that the sysfs functions
are checking the stp_online flag, but this flag just holds the user
setting whether STP is enabled. Add a flag to clock_sync_flag whether
stp_info holds valid data and use that instead.
