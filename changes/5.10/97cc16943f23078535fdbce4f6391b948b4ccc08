iwlwifi: mvm: write queue_sync_state only for sync

We use mvm->queue_sync_state to wait for synchronous queue sync
messages, but if an async one happens inbetween we shouldn't
clear mvm->queue_sync_state after sending the async one, that
can run concurrently (at least from the CPU POV) with another
synchronous queue sync.
