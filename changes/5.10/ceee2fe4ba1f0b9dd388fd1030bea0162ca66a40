KVM: arm64: Choose hyp symbol based on context

Make CHOOSE_HYP_SYM select the symbol of the active hypervisor for the
host, the nVHE symbol for nVHE and the VHE symbol for VHE. The nVHE and
VHE hypervisors see their own symbols without prefixes and trigger a
link error when trying to use a symbol of the other hypervisor.
