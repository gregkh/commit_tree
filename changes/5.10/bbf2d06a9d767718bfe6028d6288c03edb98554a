scsi: qla2xxx: Fix wrong return value in qlt_chk_unresolv_exchg()

In the case of a failed retry, a positive value EIO is returned here.  I
think this is a typo error. It is necessary to return an error value.

[mkp: caller checks != 0 but the rest of the file uses -Exxx so fix this up
to be consistent]
