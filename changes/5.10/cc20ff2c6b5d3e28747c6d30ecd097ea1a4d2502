mac80211: swap NEED_TXPROCESSING and HW_80211_ENCAP tx flags

In order to unify the tx status path, the hw 802.11 encapsulation flag
needs to survive the trip to the tx status call.
Since we don't have any free bits in info->flags, we need to move one.
IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_NEED_TXPROCESSING is only used internally in mac80211,
and only before the call into the driver.
