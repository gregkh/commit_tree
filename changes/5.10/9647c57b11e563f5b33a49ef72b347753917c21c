xsk: i40e: ice: ixgbe: mlx5: Test for dma_need_sync earlier for better performance

Test for dma_need_sync earlier to increase
performance. xsk_buff_dma_sync_for_cpu() takes an xdp_buff as
parameter and from that the xsk_buff_pool reference is dug out. Perf
shows that this dereference causes a lot of cache misses. But as the
buffer pool is now sent down to the driver at zero-copy initialization
time, we might as well use this pointer directly, instead of going via
the xsk_buff and we can do so already in xsk_buff_dma_sync_for_cpu()
instead of in xp_dma_sync_for_cpu. This gets rid of these cache
misses.

Throughput increases with 3% for the xdpsock l2fwd sample application
on my machine.
