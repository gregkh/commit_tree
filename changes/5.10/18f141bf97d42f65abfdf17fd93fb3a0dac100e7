ibmvnic: stop free_all_rwi on failed reset

When ibmvnic fails to reset, it breaks out of the reset loop and frees
all of the remaining resets from the workqueue. Doing so prevents the
adapter from recovering if no reset is scheduled after that. Instead,
have the driver continue to process resets on the workqueue.

Remove the no longer need free_all_rwi().
