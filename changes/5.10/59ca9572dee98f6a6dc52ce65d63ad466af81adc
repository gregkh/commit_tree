iwlwifi: mvm: use CHECKSUM_COMPLETE

On newer hardware, we have the full checksum, so use it to report
CHECKSUM_COMPLETE and avoid the protocol specific hardware parsing.

Note that the hardware already parses/removes the SNAP header, so
we actually literally get what we need to report to the stack, as
we're expected to checksum everything after the L2 header (which
is translated/added by mac80211).
