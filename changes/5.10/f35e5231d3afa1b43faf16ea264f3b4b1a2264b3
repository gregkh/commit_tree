media: dvb_usb_pctv452e: use ISL6423 voltage regulator per default

Both TT-connect S2-3600 and Pinnacle PCTV Sat HDTV are using
Intersil ISL6423 as LNB voltage regulator. This makes
TT-connect S2-3650 CI the only device which uses STM LNBP22 regulator
which is currently used for all devices driven by pctv452e driver.

This patch fixes this by creating an exception for TT-connect S2-3650 CI
to continue to use STM LNBP22 while all others now using correct ISL6423
driver which makes DiSEqC/EN50494 comands which involve voltage changes
now working on the other devices (which didn't work before).
