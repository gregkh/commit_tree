nvme: ignore zone validate errors on subsequent scans

Revalidating nvme zoned namespaces requires IO commands, and there are
controller states that prevent IO. For example, a sanitize in progress
is required to fail all IO, but we don't want to remove a namespace
we've previously added just because the controller is in such a state.
Suppress the error in this case.
