powerpc/smp: Limit CPUs traversed to within a node.

All the arch specific topology cpumasks are within a node/DIE.
However when setting these per CPU cpumasks, system traverses through
all the online CPUs. This is redundant.

Reduce the traversal to only CPUs that are online in the node to which
the CPU belongs to.
