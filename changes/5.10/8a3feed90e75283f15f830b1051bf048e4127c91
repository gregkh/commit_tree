bpf, selftest: Fix flaky tcp_hdr_options test when adding addr to lo

The tcp_hdr_options test adds a "::eB9F" addr to the lo dev.
However, this non loopback address will have a race on ipv6 dad
which may lead to EADDRNOTAVAIL error from time to time.

Even nodad is used in the iproute2 command, there is still a race in
when the route will be added.  This will then lead to ENETUNREACH from
time to time.

To avoid the above, this patch uses the default loopback address "::1"
to do the test.
