sched/fair: Reduce busy load balance interval

The busy_factor, which increases load balance interval when a cpu is busy,
is set to 32 by default. This value generates some huge LB interval on
large system like the THX2 made of 2 node x 28 cores x 4 threads.
For such system, the interval increases from 112ms to 3584ms at MC level.
And from 228ms to 7168ms at NUMA level.

Even on smaller system, a lower busy factor has shown improvement on the
fair distribution of the running time so let reduce it for all.
