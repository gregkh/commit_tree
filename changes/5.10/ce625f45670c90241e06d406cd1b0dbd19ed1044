drm/imx: compile imx directory by default

Currently the drm/imx/ directory is compiled only if DRM_IMX is set. Adding a
new IMX related IP in the same directory would need DRM_IMX to be set, which would
bring in also IPUv3 core driver...

The current patch would allow adding new IPs in the imx/ directory without needing
to set DRM_IMX.
