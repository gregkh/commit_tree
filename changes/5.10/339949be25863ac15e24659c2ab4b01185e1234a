scripts/selinux,selinux: update mdp to enable policy capabilities

Presently mdp does not enable any SELinux policy capabilities
in the dummy policy it generates. Thus, policies derived from
it will by default lack various features commonly used in modern
policies such as open permission, extended socket classes, network
peer controls, etc.  Split the policy capability definitions out into
their own headers so that we can include them into mdp without pulling in
other kernel headers and extend mdp generate policycap statements for the
policy capabilities known to the kernel.  Policy authors may wish to
selectively remove some of these from the generated policy.
