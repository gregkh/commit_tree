KVM: arm64: nVHE: Migrate hyp interface to SMCCC

Rather than passing arbitrary function pointers to run at hyp, define
and equivalent set of SMCCC functions.

Since the SMCCC functions are strongly tied to the original function
prototypes, it is not expected for the host to ever call an invalid ID
but a warning is raised if this does ever occur.

As __kvm_vcpu_run is used for every switch between the host and a guest,
it is explicitly singled out to be identified before the other function
IDs to improve the performance of the hot path.
