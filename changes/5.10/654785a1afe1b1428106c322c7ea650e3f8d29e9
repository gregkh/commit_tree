net: sockmap: Remove unnecessary sk_fullsock checks

The lookup paths for sockmap and sockhash currently include a check
that returns NULL if the socket we just found is not a full socket.
However, this check is not necessary. On insertion we ensure that
we have a full socket (caveat around sock_ops), so request sockets
are not a problem. Time-wait sockets are allocated separate from
the original socket and then fed into the hashdance. They don't
affect the sockets already stored in the sockmap.
