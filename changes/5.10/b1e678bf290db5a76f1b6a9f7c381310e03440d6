RMDA/sw: Don't allow drivers using dma_virt_ops on highmem configs

dma_virt_ops requires that all pages have a kernel virtual address.
Introduce a INFINIBAND_VIRT_DMA Kconfig symbol that depends on !HIGHMEM
and make all three drivers depend on the new symbol.

Also remove the ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT dependency, which has been obsolete
since commit 4965a68780c5 ("arch: define the ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT config
symbol in lib/Kconfig")

Fixes: 551199aca1c3 ("lib/dma-virt: Add dma_virt_ops")
