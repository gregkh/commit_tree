EDAC/amd64: Set proper family type for Family 19h Models 20h-2Fh

AMD Family 19h Models 20h-2Fh use the same PCI IDs as Family 17h Models
70h-7Fh. The same family ops and number of channels also apply.

Use the Family17h Model 70h family_type and ops for Family 19h Models
20h-2Fh. Update the controller name to match the system.
