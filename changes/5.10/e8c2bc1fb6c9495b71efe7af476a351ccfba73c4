io_uring: get rid of req->io/io_async_ctx union

There's really no point in having this union, it just means that we're
always allocating enough room to cater to any command. But that's
pointless, as the ->io field is request type private anyway.

This gets rid of the io_async_ctx structure, and fills in the required
size in the io_op_defs[] instead.
