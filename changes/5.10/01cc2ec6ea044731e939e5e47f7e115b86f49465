media: atomisp: cleanup __printf() atributes on printk messages

There are still some warnings produced by -Wsuggest-attribute=format,
like this one:

	drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/runtime/debug/src/ia_css_debug.c: In function ‘dtrace_dot’:
	drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/runtime/debug/src/ia_css_debug.c:2466:2: warning: function ‘dtrace_dot’ might be a candidate for ‘gnu_printf’ format attribute [-Wsuggest-attribute=format]
	 2466 |  ia_css_debug_vdtrace(IA_CSS_DEBUG_INFO, fmt, ap);
	      |  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also, on some places, is is using __atribute, while on others it
is using the __printf() macro.

Uniform those to always use the __printf() macro, placing it
before the function, and fix the logic in order to cleanup
all such warnings.
