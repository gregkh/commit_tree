drm/i915: Initial implementation of PSR2 selective fetch

All GEN12 platforms supports PSR2 selective fetch but not all GEN12
platforms supports PSR2 hardware tracking(aka RKL).

This feature consists in software programming registers with the
damaged area of each plane this way hardware will only fetch from
memory those areas and sent the PSR2 selective update blocks to panel,
saving even more power.

But as initial step it is only enabling the full frame fetch at
every flip, the actual selective fetch part will come in a future
patch.

Also this is only handling the page flip side, it is still completely
missing frontbuffer modifications, that is why the
enable_psr2_sel_fetch parameter was added.

v3:
- calling intel_psr2_sel_fetch_update() during the atomic check phase
