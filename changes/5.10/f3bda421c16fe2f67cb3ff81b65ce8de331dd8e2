btrfs: use the same helper for data and metadata reservations

Now that data reservations follow the same pattern as metadata
reservations we can simply rename __reserve_metadata_bytes to
__reserve_bytes and use that helper for data reservations.

Things to keep in mind, btrfs_can_overcommit() returns 0 for data,
because we can never overcommit.  We also will never pass in FLUSH_ALL
for data, so we'll simply be added to the priority list and go straight
into handle_reserve_ticket.
