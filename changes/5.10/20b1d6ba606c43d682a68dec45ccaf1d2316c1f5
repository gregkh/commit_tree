PCI: brcmstb: Set bus max burst size by chip type

The proper value of the parameter SCB_MAX_BURST_SIZE varies per chip.  The
2711 family requires 128B whereas other devices can employ 512.  The
assignment is complicated by the fact that the values for this two-bit
field have different meanings;

  Value   Type_Generic    Type_7278

     00       Reserved         128B
     01           128B         256B
     10           256B         512B
     11           512B     Reserved
