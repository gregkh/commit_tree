staging: octeon: Drop on uncorrectable alignment or FCS error

Currently in case of alignment or FCS error if the packet cannot be
corrected it's still not dropped. Report the error properly and drop the
packet while making the code around a little bit more readable.

Fixes: 80ff0fd3ab64 ("Staging: Add octeon-ethernet driver files.")
