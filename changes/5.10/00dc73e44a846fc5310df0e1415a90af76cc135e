bpf/selftests: Test for bpf_per_cpu_ptr() and bpf_this_cpu_ptr()

Test bpf_per_cpu_ptr() and bpf_this_cpu_ptr(). Test two paths in the
kernel. If the base pointer points to a struct, the returned reg is
of type PTR_TO_BTF_ID. Direct pointer dereference can be applied on
the returned variable. If the base pointer isn't a struct, the
returned reg is of type PTR_TO_MEM, which also supports direct pointer
dereference.
