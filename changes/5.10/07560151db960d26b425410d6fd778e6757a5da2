block: make bio_crypt_clone() able to fail

bio_crypt_clone() assumes its gfp_mask argument always includes
__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM, so that the mempool_alloc() will always succeed.

However, bio_crypt_clone() might be called with GFP_ATOMIC via
setup_clone() in drivers/md/dm-rq.c, or with GFP_NOWAIT via
kcryptd_io_read() in drivers/md/dm-crypt.c.

Neither case is currently reachable with a bio that actually has an
encryption context.  However, it's fragile to rely on this.  Just make
bio_crypt_clone() able to fail, analogous to bio_integrity_clone().
