perf jevents: Fix event code for events referencing std arch events

The event code for events referencing std arch events is incorrectly
evaluated in json_events().

The issue is that je.event is evaluated properly from try_fixup(), but
later NULLified from the real_event() call, as "event" may be NULL.

Fix by setting "event" same je.event in try_fixup().

Also remove support for overwriting event code for events using std arch
events, as it is not used.
