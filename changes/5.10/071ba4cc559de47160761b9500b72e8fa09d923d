RDMA: Add rdma_connect_locked()

There are two flows for handling RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_RESOLVED, either the
handler triggers a completion and another thread does rdma_connect() or
the handler directly calls rdma_connect().

In all cases rdma_connect() needs to hold the handler_mutex, but when
handler's are invoked this is already held by the core code. This causes
ULPs using the 2nd method to deadlock.

Provide a rdma_connect_locked() and have all ULPs call it from their
handlers.
