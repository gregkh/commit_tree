rcuperf: Change rcuperf to rcuscale

This commit further avoids conflation of rcuperf with the kernel's perf
feature by renaming kernel/rcu/rcuperf.c to kernel/rcu/rcuscale.c, and
also by similarly renaming the functions and variables inside this file.
This has the side effect of changing the names of the kernel boot
parameters, so kernel-parameters.txt and ver_functions.sh are also
updated.  The rcutorture --torture type was also updated from rcuperf
to rcuscale.
