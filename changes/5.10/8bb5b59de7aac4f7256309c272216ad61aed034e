staging: greybus: codecs: use SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_S16_LE for format bitmask

snd_soc_pcm_stream.formats should use the bitmask SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_*
instead of the sequential integers SNDRV_PCM_FORMAT_* as explained by
commit e712bfca1ac1f63f622f87c2f33b57608f2a4d19
("ASoC: codecs: use SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_* for format bitmask").
