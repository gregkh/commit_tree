net: hns3: remove a misused pragma packed

hclge_dbg_reg_info[] is defined as an array of packed structure
accidentally. However, this array contains pointers, which are
no longer aligned naturally, and cannot be relocated on PPC64.
Hence, when compile-testing this driver on PPC64 with
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y (e.g. PowerPC allyesconfig), there will be
some warnings.

Since each field in structure hclge_qos_pri_map_cmd and
hclge_dbg_bitmap_cmd is type u8, the pragma packed is unnecessary
for these two structures as well, so remove the pragma packed in
hclge_debugfs.h to fix this issue, and this increases
hclge_dbg_reg_info[] by 4 bytes per entry.
