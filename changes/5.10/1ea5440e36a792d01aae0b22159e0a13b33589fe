iommu/tegra-smmu: Prune IOMMU group when it is released

In order to share groups between multiple devices we keep track of them
in a per-SMMU list. When an IOMMU group is released, a dangling pointer
to it stays around in that list. Fix this by implementing an IOMMU data
release callback for groups where the dangling pointer can be removed.
