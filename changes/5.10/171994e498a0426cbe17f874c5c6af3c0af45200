media: uvcvideo: Silence shift-out-of-bounds warning

UBSAN reports a shift-out-of-bounds warning in uvc_get_le_value(). The
report is correct, but the issue should be harmless as the computed
value isn't used when the shift is negative. This may however cause
incorrect behaviour if a negative shift could generate adverse side
effects (such as a trap on some architectures for instance).

Regardless of whether that may happen or not, silence the warning as a
full WARN backtrace isn't nice.
