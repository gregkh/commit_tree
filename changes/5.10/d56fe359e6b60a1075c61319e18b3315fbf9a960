ARM: dts: am57xx-idk: switch to new cpsw switch drv

Switch all am571/2/4-idk boards to use new cpsw switch driver.
Those boards have 2 Ext. port wired and configured in dual_mac mode by
default. Hence, dual_mac mode has been preserved the same way between
legacy and new driver it's safe to switch drivers.
