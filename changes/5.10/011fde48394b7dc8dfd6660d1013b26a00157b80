mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: make sure delay chain locked for HS400

For eMMC HS400 mode initialization, the DLL reset is a required step
if DLL is enabled to use previously, like in bootloader.
This step has not been documented in reference manual, but the RM will
be fixed sooner or later.

This patch is to add the step of DLL reset, and make sure delay chain
locked for HS400.
