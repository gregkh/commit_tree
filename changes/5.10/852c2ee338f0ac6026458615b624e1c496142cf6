selftests/bpf/test_offload.py: Fix expected case of extack messages

Commit 7f0a838254bd ("bpf, xdp: Maintain info on attached XDP BPF programs
in net_device") changed the case of some of the extack messages being
returned when attaching of XDP programs failed. This broke test_offload.py,
so let's fix the test to reflect this.
