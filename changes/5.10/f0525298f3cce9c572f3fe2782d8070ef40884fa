net: ena: Change log message to netif/dev function

Make log prints in ena_netdev use the same log functions as the rest of
the driver.

For the sake of consistency, all prints in ena_netdev file were
converted into netif_* format except where netdev struct isn't yet
defined. For these places, dev_* log functions are used (similar to
the patch for ena_com files).

This commit leaves some corner cases which would be changed in a
future patch.
