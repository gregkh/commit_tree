mfd: Add simple regmap based I2C driver

There are I2C devices which contain several different functions but
doesn't require any special access functions. For these kind of drivers
an I2C regmap should be enough.

Create an I2C driver which creates an I2C regmap and enumerates its
children. If a device wants to use this as its MFD core driver, it has
to add an individual compatible string. It may provide its own regmap
configuration.

Subdevices can use dev_get_regmap() on the parent to get their regmap
instance.
