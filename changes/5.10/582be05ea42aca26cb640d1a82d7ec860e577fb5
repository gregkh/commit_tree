gpio: mockup: use the generic 'gpio-line-names' property

GPIO line names are currently created by the driver from the chip label.
We'll want to support custom formats for line names (for instance: to
name all lines the same) for user-space tests so create them in the
module init function and pass them to the driver using the standard
'gpio-line-names' property.
