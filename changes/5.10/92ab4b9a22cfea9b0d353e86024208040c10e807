KVM: selftests: Add wrfract to common guest code

Wrfract will be used by the dirty logging perf test introduced later in
this series to dirty memory sparsely.

This series was tested by running the following invocations on an Intel
Skylake machine:
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20m -i 100 -v 64
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20g -i 5 -v 4
dirty_log_perf_test -b 4g -i 5 -v 32
demand_paging_test -b 20m -v 64
demand_paging_test -b 20g -v 4
demand_paging_test -b 4g -v 32
All behaved as expected.
