drm: ast: fix double __iomem sparse warning

sparse complains about having 2 "__iomem" attributes on the same line
where only one is needed since the first one applies to everything
up to the ending ';'.
However, to make it clear(er) that both of these pointers are
"__iomem", use separate lines for them.

../drivers/gpu/drm/ast/ast_cursor.c:256:26: CK: warning: duplicate [noderef]
../drivers/gpu/drm/ast/ast_cursor.c:256:26: CK: error: multiple address space given: __iomem & __iomem
