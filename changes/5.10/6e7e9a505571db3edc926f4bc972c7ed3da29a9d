gfs2: factor evict_unlinked_inode out of gfs2_evict_inode

Function gfs2_evict_inode is way too big, complex and unreadable. This
is a baby step toward breaking it apart to be more readable. It factors
out the portion that deletes the online bits for a dinode that is
unlinked and needs to be deleted. A future patch will factor out more.
(If I factor out too much, the patch itself becomes unreadable).
