ext4: fix superblock checksum calculation race

The race condition could cause the persisted superblock checksum
to not match the contents of the superblock, causing the
superblock to be considered corrupt.

An example of the race follows.  A first thread is interrupted in the
middle of a checksum calculation. Then, another thread changes the
superblock, calculates a new checksum, and sets it. Then, the first
thread resumes and sets the checksum based on the older superblock.

To fix, serialize the superblock checksum calculation using the buffer
header lock. While a spinlock is sufficient, the buffer header is
already there and there is precedent for locking it (e.g. in
ext4_commit_super).

Tested the patch by booting up a kernel with the patch, creating
a filesystem and some files (including some orphans), and then
unmounting and remounting the file system.
