KVM: arm64: Remove AA64ZFR0_EL1 accessors

The AA64ZFR0_EL1 accessors are just the general accessors with
its visibility function open-coded. It also skips the if-else
chain in read_id_reg, but there's no reason not to go there.
Indeed consolidating ID register accessors and removing lines
of code make it worthwhile.

Remove the AA64ZFR0_EL1 accessors, replacing them with the
general accessors for sanitized ID registers.

No functional change intended.
