cxgb4/ch_ipsec: Registering xfrmdev_ops with cxgb4

As ch_ipsec was removed without clearing xfrmdev_ops and netdev
feature(esp-hw-offload). When a recalculation of netdev feature is
triggered by changing tls feature(tls-hw-tx-offload) from user
request, it causes a page fault due to absence of valid xfrmdev_ops.
