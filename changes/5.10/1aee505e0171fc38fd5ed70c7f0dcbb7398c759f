x86/platform/uv: Remove spaces from OEM IDs

Testing shows that trailing spaces caused problems with the OEM_ID and
the OEM_TABLE_ID.  One being that the OEM_ID would not string compare
correctly.  Another the OEM_ID and OEM_TABLE_ID would be concatenated
in the printout.  Remove any trailing spaces.
