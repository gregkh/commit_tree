rtc: cmos: zero-init wkalrm when reading from CMOS

cmos_read_alarm() may leave certain fields of a struct rtc_wkalrm
untouched; therefore, these fields contain garbage if not properly
initialized, leading to inconsistent values when converting into
time64_t. This patch to zero initialize the struct before calling
cmos_read_alarm().

Note that this patch is not intended to produce a correct time64_t, it
is only to produce a consistent value. In the case of suspend/resume, a
correct time64_t is not necessary; a consistent value is sufficient to
correctly perform an equality test for t_current_expires and
t_saved_expires. Logic to deduce a correct time64_t is expensive and
hence should be avoided.
