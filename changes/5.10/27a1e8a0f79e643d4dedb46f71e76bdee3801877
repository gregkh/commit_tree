sunrpc: raise kernel RPC channel buffer size

Its possible that using AUTH_SYS and mountd manage-gids option a
user may hit the 8k RPC channel buffer limit. This have been observed
on field, causing unanswered RPCs on clients after mountd fails to
write on channel :

rpc.mountd[11231]: auth_unix_gid: error writing reply

Userland nfs-utils uses a buffer size of 32k (RPC_CHAN_BUF_SIZE), so
lets match those two.
