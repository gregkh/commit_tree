RDMA/hns: Add a check for current state before modifying QP

It should be considered an illegal operation if the ULP attempts to modify
a QP from another state to the current hardware state. Otherwise, the ULP
can modify some fields of QPC at any time. For example, for a QP in state
of RTS, modify it from RTR to RTS can change the PSN, which is always not
as expected.
