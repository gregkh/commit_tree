speakup: Fix var_id_t values and thus keymap

commit d97a9d7aea04 ("staging/speakup: Add inflection synth parameter")
introduced a new "inflection" speakup parameter next to "pitch", but
the values of the var_id_t enum are actually used by the keymap tables
so we must not renumber them. The effect was that notably the volume
control shortcut (speakup-1 or 2) was actually changing the inflection.

This moves the INFLECTION value at the end of the var_id_t enum to
fix back the enum values. This also adds a warning about it.
