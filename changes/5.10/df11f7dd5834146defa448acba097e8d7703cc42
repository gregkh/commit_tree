selftests: kvm: Fix the segment descriptor layout to match the actual layout

Fix the layout of 'struct desc64' to match the layout described in the
SDM Vol 3, Chapter 3 "Protected-Mode Memory Management", section 3.4.5
"Segment Descriptors", Figure 3-8 "Segment Descriptor".  The test added
later in this series relies on this and crashes if this layout is not
correct.
