drm/bridge: tc358764: add drm_panel_bridge support

Prepare the tc358764 bridge driver for use in a chained setup by
replacing direct use of drm_panel with drm_panel_bridge support.

The bridge panel will use the connector type reported by the panel,
where the connector for this driver hardcodes DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_LVDS.

The tc358764 did not add any additional info the the connector so the
connector creation is passed to the bridge panel driver.

v3:
  - Merge with patch to make connector creation optional to avoid
    creating two connectors (Laurent)
  - Pass connector creation to bridge panel, as this bridge driver
    did not add any extra info to the connector.
  - Set bridge.type to DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_LVDS.

v2:
  - Use PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() (kbuild test robot)
