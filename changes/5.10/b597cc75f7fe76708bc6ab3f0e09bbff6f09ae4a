mtd: parsers: bcm63xx: Do not make it modular

With commit 91e81150d388 ("mtd: parsers: bcm63xx: simplify CFE
detection"), we generate a reference to fw_arg3 which is the fourth
firmware/command line argument on MIPS platforms. That symbol is not
exported and would cause a linking failure.

The parser is typically necessary to boot a BCM63xx-based system anyway
so having it be part of the kernel image makes sense, therefore make it
'bool' instead of 'tristate'.
