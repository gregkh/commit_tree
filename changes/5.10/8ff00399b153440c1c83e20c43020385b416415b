kernel/cpu: add arch override for clear_tasks_mm_cpumask() mm handling

powerpc/64s keeps a counter in the mm which counts bits set in
mm_cpumask as well as other things. This means it can't use generic code
to clear bits out of the mask and doesn't adjust the arch specific
counter.

Add an arch override that allows powerpc/64s to use
clear_tasks_mm_cpumask().
