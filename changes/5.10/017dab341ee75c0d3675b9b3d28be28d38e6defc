bpf: Check CONFIG_BPF option for resolve_btfids

Currently all the resolve_btfids 'users' are under CONFIG_BPF
code, so if we have CONFIG_BPF disabled, resolve_btfids will
fail, because there's no data to resolve.

Disabling resolve_btfids if there's CONFIG_BPF disabled,
so we won't fail such builds.
