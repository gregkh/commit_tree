NFSD: Fix .pc_release method for NFSv2

nfsd_release_fhandle() assumes that rqstp->rq_resp always points to
an nfsd_fhandle struct. In fact, no NFSv2 procedure uses struct
nfsd_fhandle as its response structure.

So far that has been "safe" to do because the res structs put the
resp->fh field at that same offset as struct nfsd_fhandle. I don't
think that's a guarantee, though, and there is certainly nothing
preventing a developer from altering the fields in those structures.
