drm/i915/selftests: Prevent selecting 0 for our random width/align

When igt_random_offset() is a given a range of [0, PAGE_SIZE], it is
allowed to return 0. However, attempting to use a size of 0 for the
igt_lmem_write_cpu() byte poking, leads to call igt_random_offset() with
a range of [offset, offset + 0] and ask it to find a length of 4 within
it. This triggers the bug on that the requested length should fit within
the range!
