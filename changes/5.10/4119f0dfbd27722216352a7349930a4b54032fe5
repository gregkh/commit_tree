docs: ABI: change read/write attributes

Unfortunately, (R) and (W) are valid markups for enumerated
lists, as described at:
	https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#enumerated-lists

So, we ned to replace them by:

	(R) -> (Read)
	(W) -> (Write)

As otherwise, (R) will be displayed as R., with is not what
it is desired.

There's no need to touch (RO) and (RW).
