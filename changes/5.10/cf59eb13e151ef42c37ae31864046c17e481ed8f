KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix symbol undeclared warnings

Build the kernel with `C=2`:
arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_nested.c:572:25: warning: symbol
'kvmhv_alloc_nested' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_64_mmu_radix.c:350:6: warning: symbol
'kvmppc_radix_set_pte_at' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv.c:3568:5: warning: symbol
'kvmhv_p9_guest_entry' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rm_xics.c:767:15: warning: symbol 'eoi_rc'
was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_64_vio_hv.c:240:13: warning: symbol
'iommu_tce_kill_rm' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_64_vio.c:492:6: warning: symbol
'kvmppc_tce_iommu_do_map' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_pr.c:572:6: warning: symbol 'kvmppc_set_pvr_pr'
was not declared. Should it be static?

Those symbols are used only in the files that define them so make them
static to fix the warnings.
