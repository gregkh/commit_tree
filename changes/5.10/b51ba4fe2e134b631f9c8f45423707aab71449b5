powerpc/32s: Fix assembler warning about r0

The assembler says:
  arch/powerpc/kernel/head_32.S:1095: Warning: invalid register expression

It's objecting to the use of r0 as the RA argument. That's because
when RA = 0 the literal value 0 is used, rather than the content of
r0, making the use of r0 in the source potentially confusing.

Fix it to use a literal 0, the generated code is identical.
