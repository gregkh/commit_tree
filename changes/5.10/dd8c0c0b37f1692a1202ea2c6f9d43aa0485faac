ASoC: txx9: Replace tasklet with work

The tasklet is an old API that should be deprecated, usually can be
converted to another decent API.  In ASoC TXx9 ACLC driver, a tasklet
is still used for offloading the hardware reset function.  It can be
achieved gracefully with a work queued, too.

This patch replaces the tasklet usage in TXx9 ACLC driver with a
simple work.  The conversion is fairly straightforward.
