net/sched: act_vlan: Add {POP,PUSH}_ETH actions

Implement TCA_VLAN_ACT_POP_ETH and TCA_VLAN_ACT_PUSH_ETH, to
respectively pop and push a base Ethernet header at the beginning of a
frame.

POP_ETH is just a matter of pulling ETH_HLEN bytes. VLAN tags, if any,
must be stripped before calling POP_ETH.

PUSH_ETH is restricted to skbs with no mac_header, and only the MAC
addresses can be configured. The Ethertype is automatically set from
skb->protocol. These restrictions ensure that all skb's fields remain
consistent, so that this action can't confuse other part of the
networking stack (like GSO).

Since openvswitch already had these actions, consolidate the code in
skbuff.c (like for vlan and mpls push/pop).
