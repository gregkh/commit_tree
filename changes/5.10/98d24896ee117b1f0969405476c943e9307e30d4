arm64: dts: meson: add support for the ODROID-N2+

HardKernel ODROID-N2+ uses an Amlogic S922X rev. C chip capable of higher
clock speeds than the original ODROID-N2.

The rev. C support a slighly higher VDDCPU_A & VDDCPU_B voltages and supports
the same OPPs as the Amlogic A311D SoC from the same G12B family.
