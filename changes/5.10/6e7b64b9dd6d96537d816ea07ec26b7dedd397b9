elfcore: fix building with clang

kernel/elfcore.c only contains weak symbols, which triggers a bug with
clang in combination with recordmcount:

  Cannot find symbol for section 2: .text.
  kernel/elfcore.o: failed

Move the empty stubs into linux/elfcore.h as inline functions.  As only
two architectures use these, just use the architecture specific Kconfig
symbols to key off the declaration.
