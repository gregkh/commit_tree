kselftests/arm64: add nop checks for PAuth tests

PAuth adds sign/verify controls to enable and disable groups of
instructions in hardware for compatibility with libraries that do not
implement PAuth. The kernel always enables them if it detects PAuth.

Add a test that checks that each group of instructions is enabled, if the
kernel reports PAuth as detected.

Note: For groups, for the purpose of this patch, we intend instructions
that use a certain key.
