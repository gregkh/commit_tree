gpio: dwapb: Get reset control by means of resource managed interface

The reset control interface provides the resource managed version of
the reset_control_get() method. The only thing which needs to be also
automated is the reset lane assertion on the device removal. It can be
implemented by means of the custom action definition. After that the reset
control will be purely managed by the device resources interface.
