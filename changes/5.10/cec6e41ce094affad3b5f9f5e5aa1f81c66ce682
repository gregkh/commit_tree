ASoC: hdac_hdmi: remove cancel_work_sync in runtime suspend

A deadlock is identified when there are three contexts running at the
same time:
- a HDMI jack work which is calling snd_soc_dapm_sync().
- user space is calling snd_pcm_release() to close pcm device.
- pm is calling runtime suspend function of HDMI codec driver.

By removing the clear_dapm_works() invocation in the
hdac_hdmi_runtime_suspend() function, the snd_pcm_release() could
always returns from dapm_power_widgets() function call without
blocking the hdac_hdmi_jack_dapm_work() work thread or being blocked
by the hdac_hdmi_runtime_suspend() function. The purpose of the jack
work is to enable/disable the dapm jack pin so it's not necessary to
cancel the work in runtime suspend function which is usually called
when pcm device is closed.
