dt-bindings: arm: hisilicon: add missing properties into cpuctrl.yaml

Add properties: #address-cells, #size-cells and ranges. Due to the
Hisilicon CPU controller node may contains child nodes, change the value
of "additionalProperties" from "false" to "type: object".

The corresponding examples are also added.
