xtensa: disable preemption around cache alias management calls

Although cache alias management calls set up and tear down TLB entries
and fast_second_level_miss is able to restore TLB entry should it be
evicted they absolutely cannot preempt each other because they use the
same TLBTEMP area for different purposes.
Disable preemption around all cache alias management calls to enforce
that.
