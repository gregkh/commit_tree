drm/i915/gt: Distinguish the virtual breadcrumbs from the irq breadcrumbs

On the virtual engines, we only use the intel_breadcrumbs for tracking
signaling of stale breadcrumbs from the irq_workers. They do not have
any associated interrupt handling, active requests are passed to a
physical engine and associated breadcrumb interrupt handler. This causes
issues for us as we need to ensure that we do not actually try and
enable interrupts and the powermanagement required for them on the
virtual engine, as they will never be disabled. Instead, let's
specify the physical engine used for interrupt handler on a particular
breadcrumb.

v2: Drop b->irq_armed = true mocking for no interrupt HW
