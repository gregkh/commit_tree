ARM: dts: iwg20d-q7-common: Fix touch controller probe failure

As per the iWave RZ/G1M schematic, the signal LVDS_PPEN controls the
supply voltage for the touch panel, LVDS receiver and RGB LCD panel. Add
a regulator for these device nodes and remove the powerdown-gpios
property from the lvds-receiver node as it results in a touch controller
driver probe failure.
