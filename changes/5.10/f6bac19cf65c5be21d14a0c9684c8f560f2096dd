powerpc/powernv/smp: Fix spurious DBG() warning

When building with W=1 we get the following warning:

 arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/smp.c: In function ‘pnv_smp_cpu_kill_self’:
 arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/smp.c:276:16: error: suggest braces around
 	empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Werror=empty-body]
   276 |      cpu, srr1);
       |                ^
 cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

The full context is this block:

 if (srr1 && !generic_check_cpu_restart(cpu))
 	DBG("CPU%d Unexpected exit while offline srr1=%lx!\n",
 			cpu, srr1);

When building with DEBUG undefined DBG() expands to nothing and GCC emits
the warning due to the lack of braces around an empty statement.
