wcn36xx: Convert to VHT parameter structure on wcn3680

In order to send VHT parameters to wcn3680 we need to pass the extended V1
parameter structures to the firmware. These commands need to have the
version number set to 1.

This patch makes the conversion. The conversion consists of

1. Setting the version number for wcn3680 or leaving it at 0 otherwise
2. Setting the size of the packet header lower for wcn3620 and wcn3660

Once done all three chips can continue to use the same code to pass
parameters to their respective firmware. In the case of the wcn3680 the
passed structures will be slightly larger to accommodate communication of
VHT descriptors.
