selftests/powerpc: Fix eeh-basic.sh exit codes

The kselftests test running infrastructure expects tests to finish with an
exit code of 4 if the test decided it should be skipped. Currently
eeh-basic.sh exits with the number of devices that failed to recover, so if
four devices didn't recover we'll report a skip instead of a fail.

Fix this by checking if the return code is non-zero and report success
and failure by returning 0 or 1 respectively. For the cases where should
actually skip return 4.
