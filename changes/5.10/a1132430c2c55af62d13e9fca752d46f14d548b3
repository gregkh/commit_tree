xsk: Add shared umem support between devices

Add support to share a umem between different devices. This mode
can be invoked with the XDP_SHARED_UMEM bind flag. Previously,
sharing was only supported within the same device. Note that when
sharing a umem between devices, just as in the case of sharing a
umem between queue ids, you need to create a fill ring and a
completion ring and tie them to the socket (with two setsockopts,
one for each ring) before you do the bind with the
XDP_SHARED_UMEM flag. This so that the single-producer
single-consumer semantics of the rings can be upheld.
