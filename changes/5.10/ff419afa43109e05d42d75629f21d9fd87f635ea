ethtool: trim policy tables

Since ethtool uses strict attribute validation there's no need
to initialize all attributes in policy tables. 0 is NLA_UNSPEC
which is going to be rejected. Remove the NLA_REJECTs.

Similarly attributes above maxattrs are rejected, so there's
no need to always size the policy tables to ETHTOOL_A_..._MAX.

v2: - new patch
