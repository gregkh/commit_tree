media: pci: fix common ALSA DMA-mapping related codes

The Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt states that dma_map_sg returns the
numer of the created entries in the DMA address space. However the
subsequent calls to dma_sync_sg_for_{device,cpu} and dma_unmap_sg must be
called with the original number of entries passed to dma_map_sg. The
sg_table->nents in turn holds the result of the dma_map_sg call as stated
in include/linux/scatterlist.h. Adapt the code to obey those rules.

While touching this code, update it to use the modern DMA_FROM_DEVICE
definitions.
