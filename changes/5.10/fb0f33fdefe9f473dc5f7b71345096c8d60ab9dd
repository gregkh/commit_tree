KVM: nSVM: CR3 MBZ bits are only 63:52

Commit 761e4169346553c180bbd4a383aedd72f905bc9a created a wrong mask for the
CR3 MBZ bits. According to APM vol 2, only the upper 12 bits are MBZ.

Fixes: 761e41693465 ("KVM: nSVM: Check that MBZ bits in CR3 and CR4 are not set on vmrun of nested guests", 2020-07-08)
