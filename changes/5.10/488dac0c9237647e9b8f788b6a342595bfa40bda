libfs: fix error cast of negative value in simple_attr_write()

The attr->set() receive a value of u64, but simple_strtoll() is used for
doing the conversion.  It will lead to the error cast if user inputs a
negative value.

Use kstrtoull() instead of simple_strtoll() to convert a string got from
the user to an unsigned value.  The former will return '-EINVAL' if it
gets a negetive value, but the latter can't handle the situation
correctly.  Make 'val' unsigned long long as what kstrtoull() takes,
this will eliminate the compile warning on no 64-bit architectures.
