bus/fsl-mc: Do no longer export the total number of irqs outside dprc_scan_objects

The total number of interrupts is only used for some checks
outside the dprc_scan_objects function. Furthermore, in some
situations the check is made twice. Move the bounds check inside
the function for all situations.
