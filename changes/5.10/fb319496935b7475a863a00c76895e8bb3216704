arm64: tegra: Disable the ACONNECT for Jetson TX2

Commit ff4c371d2bc0 ("arm64: defconfig: Build ADMA and ACONNECT driver")
enable the Tegra ADMA and ACONNECT drivers and this is causing resume
from system suspend to fail on Jetson TX2. Resume is failing because the
ACONNECT driver is being resumed before the BPMP driver, and the ACONNECT
driver is attempting to power on a power-domain that is provided by the
BPMP. While a proper fix for the resume sequencing problem is identified,
disable the ACONNECT for Jetson TX2 temporarily to avoid breaking system
suspend.

Please note that ACONNECT driver is used by the Audio Processing Engine
(APE) on Tegra, but because there is no mainline support for APE on
Jetson TX2 currently, disabling the ACONNECT does not disable any useful
feature at the moment.
