media: vidtv: adjust signal strength range

On real devices, signal strength is always a negative
number when represented in dBm. A more interesting
range is to use dBmV (which is what Kaffeine does,
for example). The conversion from the two units are
simple:

	dBmV = dBm - 108

Usually, signal strength ranges up to 100dBmV. Adjust the
maximum value to be around 74 dBmV, when there's no
frequency shift, which represents a good signal.

With that, Kaffeine displays it a lot better.
