io_uring: allow disabling rings during the creation

This patch adds a new IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED flag to start the
rings disabled, allowing the user to register restrictions,
buffers, files, before to start processing SQEs.

When IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED is set, SQE are not processed and
SQPOLL kthread is not started.

The restrictions registration are allowed only when the rings
are disable to prevent concurrency issue while processing SQEs.

The rings can be enabled using IORING_REGISTER_ENABLE_RINGS
opcode with io_uring_register(2).
