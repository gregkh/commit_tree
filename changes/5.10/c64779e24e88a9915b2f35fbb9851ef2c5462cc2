selftests/bpf: Merge most of test_btf into test_progs

Merge 183 tests from test_btf into test_progs framework to be exercised
regularly. All the test_btf tests that were moved are modeled as proper
sub-tests in test_progs framework for ease of debugging and reporting.

No functional or behavioral changes were intended, I tried to preserve
original behavior as much as possible. E.g., `test_progs -v` will activate
"always_log" flag to emit BTF validation log.

The only difference is in reducing the max_entries limit for pretty-printing
tests from (128 * 1024) to just 128 to reduce tests running time without
reducing the coverage.

Example test run:

  $ sudo ./test_progs -n 8
  ...
  #8 btf:OK
  Summary: 1/183 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED
