x86/build: Declutter the build output

We have some really ancient debug printouts in the x86 boot image build code:

  Setup is 14108 bytes (padded to 14336 bytes).
  System is 8802 kB
  CRC 27e909d4

None of these ever helped debug any sort of breakage that I know of, and they
clutter the build output.

Remove them - if anyone needs the see the various interim stages of this to
debug an obscure bug, they can add these printfs and more.

We still keep this one:

  Kernel: arch/x86/boot/bzImage is ready  (#19)

As a sentimental leftover, plus the '#19' build count tag is mildly useful.
