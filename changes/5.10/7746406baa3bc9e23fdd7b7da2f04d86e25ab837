powerpc/book3s64/hash/4k: Support large linear mapping range with 4K

With commit: 0034d395f89d ("powerpc/mm/hash64: Map all the kernel
regions in the same 0xc range"), we now split the 64TB address range
into 4 contexts each of 16TB. That implies we can do only 16TB linear
mapping.

On some systems, eg. Power9, memory attached to nodes > 0 will appear
above 16TB in the linear mapping. This resulted in kernel crash when
we boot such systems in hash translation mode with 4K PAGE_SIZE.

This patch updates the kernel mapping such that we now start supporting upto
61TB of memory with 4K. The kernel mapping now looks like below 4K PAGE_SIZE
and hash translation.

    vmalloc start     = 0xc0003d0000000000
    IO start          = 0xc0003e0000000000
    vmemmap start     = 0xc0003f0000000000

Our MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS for 4K is still 64TB even though we can only map 61TB.
We prevent bolt mapping anything outside 61TB range by checking against
H_VMALLOC_START.
