x86/mce: Annotate mce_rd/wrmsrl() with noinstr

They do get called from the #MC handler which is already marked
"noinstr".

Commit

  e2def7d49d08 ("x86/mce: Make mce_rdmsrl() panic on an inaccessible MSR")

already got rid of the instrumentation in the MSR accessors, fix the
annotation now too, in order to get rid of:

  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: do_machine_check()+0x4a: call to mce_rdmsrl() leaves .noinstr.text section
