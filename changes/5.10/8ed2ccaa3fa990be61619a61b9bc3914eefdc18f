perf/x86/intel/uncore: Factor out uncore_pci_find_dev_pmu()

When an uncore PCI sub driver gets a remove notification, the
corresponding PMU has to be retrieved and unregistered. The codes, which
find the corresponding PMU by comparing the pci_device_id table, can be
shared.

Factor out uncore_pci_find_dev_pmu(), which will be used later.

There is no functional change.
