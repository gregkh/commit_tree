net/smc: introduce better field names

Field names "srv_first_contact" and "cln_first_contact" are misleading,
since they apply to both, server and client. Rename them to
"first_contact_peer" and "first_contact_local".
Rename "ism_gid" by the more precise name "ism_peer_gid".
Rename version constant "SMC_CLC_V1" into "SMC_V1".
No functional change.
