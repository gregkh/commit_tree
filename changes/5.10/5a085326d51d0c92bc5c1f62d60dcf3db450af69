KVM: VMX: Rename ops.h to vmx_ops.h

Rename ops.h to vmx_ops.h to allow adding a tdx_ops.h in the future
without causing massive confusion.

Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) is built on VMX, but KVM cannot directly
access the VMCS(es) for a TDX guest, thus TDX will need its own "ops"
implementation for wrapping the low level operations.
