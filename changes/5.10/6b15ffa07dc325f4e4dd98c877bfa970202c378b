x86/irq: Initialize PCI/MSI domain at PCI init time

No point in initializing the default PCI/MSI interrupt domain early and no
point to create it when XEN PV/HVM/DOM0 are active.

Move the initialization to pci_arch_init() and convert it to init ops so
that XEN can override it as XEN has it's own PCI/MSI management. The XEN
override comes in a later step.
