spi: spi-s3c64xx: Increase transfer timeout

Increase timeout by 30 ms for some wiggle room and set the minimum value
to 100 ms. This ensures a non-zero value for short transfers which
may take less than 1 ms. The timeout value does not affect
performance because it is used with a completion.

Similar formula is used in other drivers e.g. sun4i, sun6i.
