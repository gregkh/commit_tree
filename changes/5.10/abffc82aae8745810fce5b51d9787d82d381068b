reset: Add Raspberry Pi 4 firmware reset controller

Raspberry Pi 4's co-processor controls some of the board's HW
initialization process, but it's up to Linux to trigger it when
relevant. Introduce a reset controller capable of interfacing with
RPi4's co-processor that models these firmware initialization routines as
reset lines.
