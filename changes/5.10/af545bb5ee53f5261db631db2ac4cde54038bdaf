vsock: use ns_capable_noaudit() on socket create

During __vsock_create() CAP_NET_ADMIN is used to determine if the
vsock_sock->trusted should be set to true. This value is used later
for determing if a remote connection should be allowed to connect
to a restricted VM. Unfortunately, if the caller doesn't have
CAP_NET_ADMIN, an audit message such as an selinux denial is
generated even if the caller does not want a trusted socket.

Logging errors on success is confusing. To avoid this, switch the
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) check to the noaudit version.
