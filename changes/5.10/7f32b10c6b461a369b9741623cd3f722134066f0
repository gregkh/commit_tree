kunit: test: fix remaining kernel-doc warnings

test.h still produce three warnings:

	include/kunit/test.h:282: warning: Function parameter or member '__suites' not described in 'kunit_test_suites_for_module'
	include/kunit/test.h:282: warning: Excess function parameter 'suites_list' description in 'kunit_test_suites_for_module'
	include/kunit/test.h:314: warning: Excess function parameter 'suites' description in 'kunit_test_suites'

They're all due to errors at kernel-doc markups. Update them.

It should be noticed that this patch moved a kernel-doc
markup that were located at the wrong place, and using a wrong
name. Kernel-doc only supports kaving the markup just before the
function/macro declaration. Placing it elsewhere will make it do
wrong assumptions.
