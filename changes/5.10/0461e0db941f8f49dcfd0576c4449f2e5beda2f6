fs: dlm: remove lock dependency warning

During my experiments to make dlm robust against tcpkill application I
was able to run sometimes in a circular lock dependency warning between
clusters_root.subsys.su_mutex and con->sock_mutex. We don't need to
held the sock_mutex when getting the mark value which held the
clusters_root.subsys.su_mutex. This patch moves the specific handling
just before the sock_mutex will be held.
