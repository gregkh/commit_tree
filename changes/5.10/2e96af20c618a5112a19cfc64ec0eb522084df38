MAINTAINERS: Add Thomas as reviewer for ast, mgag200 and udl

I'm adding myself as reviewer for ast, mgag200 and udl. I've already
been keeping these drivers in shape for a while.

While at it I'm also setting the list and tree for ast and mgag200,
and update each driver's status to Supported. Working on these drivers
is part of my job.
