dm: fix request-based DM to not bounce through indirect dm_submit_bio

It is unnecessary to force request-based DM to call into bio-based
dm_submit_bio (via indirect disk->fops->submit_bio) only to have it then
call blk_mq_submit_bio().

Fix this by establishing a request-based DM block_device_operations
(dm_rq_blk_dops, which doesn't have .submit_bio) and update
dm_setup_md_queue() to set md->disk->fops to it for
DM_TYPE_REQUEST_BASED.

Remove DM_TYPE_REQUEST_BASED conditional in dm_submit_bio and unexport
blk_mq_submit_bio.
