serial: 8250: Discard RTS/DTS setting from clock update method

It has been a mistake to add the MCR register RTS/DTS fields setting in
the generic method of the UART reference clock update. There is no point
in asserting these lines at that procedure. Just discard the
serial8250_out_MCR() mathod invocation from there then.
