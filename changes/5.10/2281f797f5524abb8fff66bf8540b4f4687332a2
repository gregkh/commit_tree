mm: cma: use CMA_MAX_NAME to define the length of cma name array

CMA_MAX_NAME should be visible to CMA's users as they might need it to set
the name of CMA areas and avoid hardcoding the size locally.
So this patch moves CMA_MAX_NAME from local header file to include/linux
header file and removes the hardcode in both hugetlb.c and contiguous.c.
