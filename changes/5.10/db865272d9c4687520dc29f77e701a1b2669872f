cpufreq: Avoid configuring old governors as default with intel_pstate

Commit 33aa46f252c7 ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Use passive mode by
default without HWP") was meant to cause intel_pstate to be used
in the passive mode with the schedutil governor on top of it, but
it missed the case in which either "ondemand" or "conservative"
was selected as the default governor in the existing kernel config,
in which case the previous old governor configuration would be used,
causing the default legacy governor to be used on top of intel_pstate
instead of schedutil.

Address this by preventing "ondemand" and "conservative" from being
configured as the default cpufreq governor in the case when schedutil
is the default choice for the default governor setting.

[Note that the default cpufreq governor can still be set via the
 kernel command line if need be and that choice is not limited,
 so if anyone really wants to use one of the legacy governors by
 default, it can be achieved this way.]
