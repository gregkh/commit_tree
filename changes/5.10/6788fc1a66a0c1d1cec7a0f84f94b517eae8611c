ASoC: topology: disable size checks for bytes_ext controls if needed

When CONFIG_SND_CTL_VALIDATION is set, accesses to extended bytes
control generate spurious error messages when the size exceeds 512
bytes, such as

[ 11.224223] sof_sdw sof_sdw: control 2:0:0:EQIIR5.0 eqiir_coef_5:0:
invalid count 1024

In addition the error check returns -EINVAL which has the nasty side
effect of preventing applications accessing controls from working,
e.g.

root@plb:~# alsamixer
cannot load mixer controls: Invalid argument

It's agreed that the control interface has been abused since 2014, but
forcing a check should not prevent existing solutions from working.

This patch skips the checks conditionally if CONFIG_SND_CTL_VALIDATION
is set and the byte array provided by topology is > 512. This
preserves the checks for all other cases.
