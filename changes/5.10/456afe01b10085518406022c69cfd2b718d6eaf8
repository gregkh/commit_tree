mptcp: ADD_ADDRs with echo bit are smaller

The MPTCP ADD_ADDR suboption with echo-flag=1 has no HMAC, the size is
smaller than the one initially sent without echo-flag=1. We then need to
use the correct size everywhere when we need this echo bit.

Before this patch, the wrong size was reserved but the correct amount of
bytes were written (and read): the remaining bytes contained garbage.

Fixes: 6a6c05a8b016 ("mptcp: send out ADD_ADDR with echo flag")
