PM / devfreq: Change prototype of devfreq_get_devfreq_by_phandle function

Previously, devfreq core support 'devfreq' property in order to get
the devfreq device by phandle. But, 'devfreq' property name is not proper
on devicetree binding because this name doesn't mean the any h/w attribute.

The devfreq core hand over the right to decide the property name
for getting the devfreq device on devicetree. Each devfreq driver
will decide the property name on devicetree binding and pass
the their own property name to devfreq_get_devfreq_by_phandle function.
