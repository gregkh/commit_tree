memory: omap-gpmc: remove unused file-scope phys_base and mem_size

The file-scope variables phys_base and mem_size are assigned in
gpmc_probe() but never read.

This fixes build error when compile testing on x86_64 architecture:

    drivers/memory/omap-gpmc.c:246:24: error: conflicting types for ‘phys_base’
     static resource_size_t phys_base, mem_size;
