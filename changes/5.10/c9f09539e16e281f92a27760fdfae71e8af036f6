x86/head/64: Check SEV encryption before switching to kernel page-table

When SEV is enabled, the kernel requests the C-bit position again from
the hypervisor to build its own page-table. Since the hypervisor is an
untrusted source, the C-bit position needs to be verified before the
kernel page-table is used.

Call sev_verify_cbit() before writing the CR3.
