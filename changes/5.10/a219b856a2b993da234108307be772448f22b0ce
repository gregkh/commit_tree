ida: Free allocated bitmap in error path

If a bitmap needs to be allocated, and then by the time the thread
is scheduled to be run again all the indices which would satisfy the
allocation have been allocated then we would leak the allocation.  Almost
impossible to hit in practice, but a trivial fix.  Found by Coverity.
