bpf: Use a table to drive helper arg type checks

The mapping between bpf_arg_type and bpf_reg_type is encoded in a big
hairy if statement that is hard to follow. The debug output also leaves
to be desired: if a reg_type doesn't match we only print one of the
options, instead printing all the valid ones.

Convert the if statement into a table which is then used to drive type
checking. If none of the reg_types match we print all options, e.g.:

    R2 type=rdonly_buf expected=fp, pkt, pkt_meta, map_value
