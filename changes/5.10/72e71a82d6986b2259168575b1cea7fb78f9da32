drm/amdgpu: add new trace event for page table update

This patch adds a new trace event to track the PTE update
events. This specific event will provide information like:
- start and end of virtual memory mapping
- HW engine flags for the map
- physical address for mapping

This will be particularly useful for memory profiling tools
(like RMV) which are monitoring the page table update events.

V2: Added physical address lookup logic in trace point
V3: switch to use __dynamic_array
    added nptes int the TPprint arguments list
    added page size in the arg list
V4: Addressed Christian's review comments
    add start/end instead of seg
    use incr instead of page_sz to be accurate
V5: Addressed Christian's review comments:
    add pid and vm context information in the event
V6: Re-sequence the variables (put pid and ctx_id first)
