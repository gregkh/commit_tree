acpi-cpufreq: Honor _PSD table setting on new AMD CPUs

acpi-cpufreq has a old quirk that overrides the _PSD table supplied by
BIOS on AMD CPUs. However the _PSD table of new AMD CPUs (Family 19h+)
now accurately reports the P-state dependency of CPU cores. Hence this
quirk needs to be fixed in order to support new CPUs' frequency control.
