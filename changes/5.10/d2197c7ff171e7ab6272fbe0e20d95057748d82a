selftests/bpf_iter: Don't fail test due to missing __builtin_btf_type_id

The new test for task iteration in bpf_iter checks (in do_btf_read()) if it
should be skipped due to missing __builtin_btf_type_id. However, this
'skip' verdict is not propagated to the caller, so the parent test will
still fail. Fix this by also skipping the rest of the parent test if the
skip condition was reached.
