x86/platform/uv: Drop last traces of uv_flush_tlb_others

Commit 39297dde7390 ("x86/platform/uv: Remove UV BAU TLB Shootdown
Handler") removed uv_flush_tlb_others. Its declaration was removed also
from asm/uv/uv.h. But only for the CONFIG_X86_UV=y case. The inline
definition (!X86_UV case) is still in place.

So remove this implementation with everything what was added to support
uv_flush_tlb_others:
* include of asm/tlbflush.h
* forward declarations of struct cpumask, mm_struct, and flush_tlb_info
