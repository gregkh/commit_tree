hwmon: (core) Add support for rated attributes

Adding implementation for new attributes (rated_min/rated_max) for
currentX, inX, powerX, tempX and humidityX.

Tested with OpenBMC stack and simple hwmon driver using
rated_min/rated_max for the following types of sensors: hwmon_temp,
hwmon_in, hwmon_curr, hwmon_power, hwmon_humidity.
For each sensor rated attributes were available and returned
expected values.
