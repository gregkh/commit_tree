bpf: Explicitly size compatible_reg_types

Arrays with designated initializers have an implicit length of the highest
initialized value plus one. I used this to ensure that newly added entries
in enum bpf_reg_type get a NULL entry in compatible_reg_types.

This is difficult to understand since it requires knowledge of the
peculiarities of designated initializers. Use __BPF_ARG_TYPE_MAX to size
the array instead.
