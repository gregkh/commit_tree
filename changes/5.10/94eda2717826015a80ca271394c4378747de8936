scsi: qla2xxx: Fix point-to-point (N2N) device discovery issue

Driver was using a shorter timeout waiting for PLOGI from the peer in
point-to-point configurations. Some devices takes some time (~4 seconds) to
initiate the PLOGI. This peer initiating PLOGI is when the peer has a
higher P-WWN.

Increase the wait time based on N2N R_A_TOV.
