net/mlx5e: Generalize TX MPWQE checks for full session

As preparation for the upcoming TX MPWQE for SKBs, create a function
(mlx5e_tx_mpwqe_is_full) to check whether an MPWQE session is full. This
function will be shared by MPWQE code for XDP and for SKBs. Defines are
renamed and moved to make them not XDP-specific.
