spi: dw: Discard DW SSI chip type storages

Keeping SPI peripheral devices type is pointless since first it hasn't
been functionally utilized by any of the client drivers/code and second it
won't work for Microwire type at the very least. Moreover there is no
point in setting up the type by means of the chip-data in the modern
kernel. The peripheral devices with specific interface type need to be
detected in order to activate the corresponding frame format. It most
likely will require some peripheral device specific DT property or
whatever to find out the interface protocol. So let's remove the serial
interface type fields from the DW APB SSI controller and the SPI
peripheral device private data.

Note we'll preserve the explicit SSI_MOTO_SPI interface type setting up to
signify the only currently supported interface protocol.
