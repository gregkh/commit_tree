arm64: Run ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 enabling code on all CPUs

Commit 73f381660959 ("arm64: Advertise mitigation of Spectre-v2, or lack
thereof") changed the way we deal with ARCH_WORKAROUND_1, by moving most
of the enabling code to the .matches() callback.

This has the unfortunate effect that the workaround gets only enabled on
the first affected CPU, and no other.

In order to address this, forcefully call the .matches() callback from a
.cpu_enable() callback, which brings us back to the original behaviour.
