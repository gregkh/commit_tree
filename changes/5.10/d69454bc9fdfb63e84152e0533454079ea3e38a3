md/raid6: let syndrome computor support different page offset

For now, syndrome compute functions require common offset in the pages
array. However, we expect them to support different offset when try to
use shared page in the following. Simplily covert them by adding page
offset where each page address are referred.

Since the only caller of async_gen_syndrome() and async_syndrome_val()
are in raid6, we don't want to reserve the old interface but modify the
interface directly. After that, replacing old interfaces with new ones
for raid6 and raid6test.
