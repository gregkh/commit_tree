ASoC: SOF: fix a runtime pm issue in SOF when HDMI codec doesn't work

When hda_codec_probe() doesn't initialize audio component, we disable
the codec and keep going. However,the resources are not released. The
child_count of SOF device is increased in snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_init
but is not decrease in error case, so SOF can't get suspended.

snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_exit will be invoked in HDA framework if it
gets a error. Now copy this behavior to release resources and decrease
SOF device child_count to release SOF device.
