drm/panfrost: Ensure GPU quirks are always initialised

The GPU 'CONFIG' registers used to work around hardware issues are
cleared on reset so need to be programmed every time the GPU is reset.
However panfrost_device_reset() failed to do this.

To avoid this in future instead move the call to
panfrost_gpu_init_quirks() to panfrost_gpu_power_on() so that the
regsiters are always programmed just before the cores are powered.
