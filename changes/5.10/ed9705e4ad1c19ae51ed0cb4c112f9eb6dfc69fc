x86/mce: Drop AMD-specific "DEFERRED" case from Intel severity rule list

Way back in v3.19 Intel and AMD shared the same machine check severity
grading code. So it made sense to add a case for AMD DEFERRED errors in
commit

  e3480271f592 ("x86, mce, severity: Extend the the mce_severity mechanism to handle UCNA/DEFERRED error")

But later in v4.2 AMD switched to a separate grading function in
commit

  bf80bbd7dcf5 ("x86/mce: Add an AMD severities-grading function")

Belatedly drop the DEFERRED case from the Intel rule list.
