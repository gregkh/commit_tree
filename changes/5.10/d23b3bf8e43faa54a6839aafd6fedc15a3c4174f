ARM, sched/topology: Revert back to default scheduler topology

The ARM-specific GMC level is meant to be built using the thread sibling
mask, but no devicetree in arch/arm/boot/dts uses the 'thread' cpu-map
binding. With SD_SHARE_POWERDOMAIN gone, this topology level can be
removed, at which point ARM no longer benefits from having a custom defined
topology table.

Delete the GMC topology level by making ARM use the default scheduler
topology table. This essentially reverts commit:

  fb2aa85564f4 ("sched, ARM: Create a dedicated scheduler topology table")

No change in functionality is expected.
