coresight: cti: Fix remove sysfs link error

CTI code to remove sysfs link to other devices on shutdown, incorrectly
tries to remove a single ended link when these are all double ended. This
implementation leaves elements in the link info structure undefined which
results in a crash in recent tests for driver module unload.

This patch corrects the link removal code.
