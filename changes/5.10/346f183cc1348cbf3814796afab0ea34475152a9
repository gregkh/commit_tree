ARM: s3c24xx: make S3C24XX_MISCCR access indirect

The clk driver uses both a function call into an exported
platform file and a direct register access to a hardcoded
virtual address for accessing the MISCCR register, both
become are a problem for a multiplatform kernel because
of the header file dependency.

Make this an indirect function call through platform data
instead.
