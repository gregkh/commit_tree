sched/features: Fix !CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL case

Commit:

  765cc3a4b224e ("sched/core: Optimize sched_feat() for !CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG builds")

made sched features static for !CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG configurations, but
overlooked the CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y and !CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL cases.

For the latter echoing changes to /sys/kernel/debug/sched_features has
the nasty effect of effectively changing what sched_features reports,
but without actually changing the scheduler behaviour (since different
translation units get different sysctl_sched_features).

Fix CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y and !CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL configurations by properly
restructuring ifdefs.
