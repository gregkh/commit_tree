mwifiex: remove function pointer check

clang static analyzer reports this problem

init.c:739:8: warning: Called function pointer
  is null (null dereference)
        ret = adapter->if_ops.check_fw_status( ...
              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In mwifiex_dnld_fw, there is an earlier check for check_fw_status(),
The check was introduced for usb support at the same time this
check in _mwifiex_fw_dpc() was made

	if (adapter->if_ops.dnld_fw) {
		ret = adapter->if_ops.dnld_fw(adapter, &fw);
	} else {
		ret = mwifiex_dnld_fw(adapter, &fw);
	}

And a dnld_fw function initialized as part the usb's
mwifiex_if_ops.

The other instances of mwifiex_if_ops for pci and sdio
both set check_fw_status.

So the first check is not needed and can be removed.
