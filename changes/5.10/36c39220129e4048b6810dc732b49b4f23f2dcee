vc_screen: sanitize types in vcs_read

* pos is derived from the passed ppos, so make it long enough, i.e.
  loff_t
* attr and uni_mode are booleans, so...
* size is limited by vcs_size() which returns an int
* read, p, orig_count and this_round are always ">= 0" and "< size",
  so uint is enough
* row, col, and max_col are derived from vc->vc_cols (uint) and p, so
  make them uint too
* tmp_count is derived from this_round, so make it an uint too.
* use u16 * for org (instead of unsigned short *). No need to initialize
  org too.
