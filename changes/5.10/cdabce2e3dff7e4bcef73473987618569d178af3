softirq: Add debug check to __raise_softirq_irqoff()

__raise_softirq_irqoff() must be called with interrupts disabled to protect
the per CPU softirq pending state update against an interrupt and soft
interrupt handling on return from interrupt.

Add a lockdep assertion to validate the calling convention.
