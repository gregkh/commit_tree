gpio: dwapb: Get clocks by means of resource managed interface

The kernel clock framework provides the resource managed version of
the clk_bulk_get() method. The only thing which needs to be also automated
is the clocks disable/unprepare procedure executed on the device removal.
It can be implemented by means of the custom action definition. After that
the clocks acquisition and release will be purely managed by the device
resources interface.
