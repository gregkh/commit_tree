bcache: only use bucket_bytes() on struct cache

Because struct cache_set and struct cache both have struct cache_sb,
macro bucket_bytes() currently are used on both of them. When removing
the embedded struct cache_sb from struct cache_set, this macro won't be
used on struct cache_set anymore.

This patch unifies all bucket_bytes() usage only on struct cache, this is
one of the preparation to remove the embedded struct cache_sb from
struct cache_set.
