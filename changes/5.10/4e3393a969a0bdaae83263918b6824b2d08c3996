KVM: arm64: nVHE: Switch to hyp context for EL2

Save and restore the host context when switching to and from hyp. This
gives hyp its own context that the host will not see as a step towards a
full trust boundary between the two.

SP_EL0 and pointer authentication keys are currently shared between the
host and hyp so don't need to be switched yet.
