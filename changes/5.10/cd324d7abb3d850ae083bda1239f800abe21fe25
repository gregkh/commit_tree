bpf: Add selftests for local_storage

inode_local_storage:

* Hook to the file_open and inode_unlink LSM hooks.
* Create and unlink a temporary file.
* Store some information in the inode's bpf_local_storage during
  file_open.
* Verify that this information exists when the file is unlinked.

sk_local_storage:

* Hook to the socket_post_create and socket_bind LSM hooks.
* Open and bind a socket and set the sk_storage in the
  socket_post_create hook using the start_server helper.
* Verify if the information is set in the socket_bind hook.
