mm: memcontrol: reword obsolete comment of mem_cgroup_unmark_under_oom()

Since commit 79dfdaccd1d5 ("memcg: make oom_lock 0 and 1 based rather than
counter"), the mem_cgroup_unmark_under_oom() is added and the comment of
the mem_cgroup_oom_unlock() is moved here.  But this comment make no sense
here because mem_cgroup_oom_lock() does not operate on under_oom field.
So we reword the comment as this would be helpful.  [Thanks Michal Hocko
for rewording this comment.]
