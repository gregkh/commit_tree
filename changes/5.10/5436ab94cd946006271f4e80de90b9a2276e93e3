drm/amdkfd: fix set kfd node ras properties value

The ctx->features are new RAS implementation which
is only available for Vega20 and onwards, it is not
available for vega10, vega10 should follow legacy
ECC implementation.

Changed from V1:
    wrap function to initialize kfd node properties

Changed from V2:
    remove wrap function and SDMA SRAM ECC check
