powerpc/pseries/svm: Allocate SWIOTLB buffer anywhere in memory

POWER secure guests (i.e., guests which use the Protected Execution
Facility) need to use SWIOTLB to be able to do I/O with the
hypervisor, but they don't need the SWIOTLB memory to be in low
addresses since the hypervisor doesn't have any addressing limitation.

This solves a SWIOTLB initialization problem we are seeing in secure
guests with 128 GB of RAM: they are configured with 4 GB of
crashkernel reserved memory, which leaves no space for SWIOTLB in low
addresses.

To do this, we use mostly the same code as swiotlb_init(), but
allocate the buffer using memblock_alloc() instead of
memblock_alloc_low().
