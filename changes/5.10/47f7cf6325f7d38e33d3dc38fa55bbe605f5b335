libbpf: Skip CO-RE relocations for not loaded BPF programs

Bypass CO-RE relocations step for BPF programs that are not going to be
loaded. This allows to have BPF programs compiled in and disabled dynamically
if kernel is not supposed to provide enough relocation information. In such
case, there won't be unnecessary warnings about failed relocations.
