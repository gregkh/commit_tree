ASoC: tlv320adcx140: Fix digital gain range

According to its datasheet, the digital gain should be -100 dB when
CHx_DVOL is 1 and 27 dB when CHx_DVOL is 255. But with the current
dig_vol_tlv, "Digital CHx Out Volume" shows 27.5 dB if CHx_DVOL is 255
and -95.5 dB if CHx_DVOL is 1. This commit fixes this bug.
