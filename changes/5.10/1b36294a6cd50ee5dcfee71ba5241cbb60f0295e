btrfs: call submit_bio_hook directly for metadata pages

No need to go through a function pointer indirection simply call
submit_bio_hook directly by exporting and renaming the helper to
btrfs_submit_metadata_bio. This makes the code more readable and should
result in somewhat faster code due to no longer paying the price for
specualtive attack mitigations that come with indirect function calls.
