vt: keyboard, simplify vt_kdgkbsent

Use 'strlen' of the string, add one for NUL terminator and simply do
'copy_to_user' instead of the explicit 'for' loop. This makes the
KDGKBSENT case more compact.

The only thing we need to take care about is NULL 'func_table[i]'. Use
an empty string in that case.

The original check for overflow could never trigger as the func_buf
strings are always shorter or equal to 'struct kbsentry's.
