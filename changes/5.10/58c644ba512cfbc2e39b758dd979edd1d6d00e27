sched/idle: Fix arch_cpu_idle() vs tracing

We call arch_cpu_idle() with RCU disabled, but then use
local_irq_{en,dis}able(), which invokes tracing, which relies on RCU.

Switch all arch_cpu_idle() implementations to use
raw_local_irq_{en,dis}able() and carefully manage the
lockdep,rcu,tracing state like we do in entry.

(XXX: we really should change arch_cpu_idle() to not return with
interrupts enabled)
