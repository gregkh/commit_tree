ALSA: hda/realtek - set mic to auto detect on a HP AIO machine

Recently we enabled a HP AIO machine, we found the mic on the machine
couldn't record any sound and it couldn't detect plugging and
unplugging as well.

Through debugging we found the mic is set to manual detect mode, after
setting it to auto detect mode, it could detect plugging and
unplugging and could record sound.
