fscrypt: remove reachable WARN in fscrypt_setup_iv_ino_lblk_32_key()

I_CREATING isn't actually set until the inode has been assigned an inode
number and inserted into the inode hash table.  So the WARN_ON() in
fscrypt_setup_iv_ino_lblk_32_key() is wrong, and it can trigger when
creating an encrypted file on ext4.  Remove it.

This was sometimes causing xfstest generic/602 to fail on ext4.  I
didn't notice it before because due to a separate oversight, new inodes
that haven't been assigned an inode number yet don't necessarily have
i_ino == 0 as I had thought, so by chance I never saw the test fail.
