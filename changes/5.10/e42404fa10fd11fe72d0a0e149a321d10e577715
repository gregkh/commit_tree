ARC: stack unwinding: don't assume non-current task is sleeping

To start stack unwinding (SP, PC and BLINK) are needed. When the
explicit execution context (pt_regs etc) is not available, unwinder
assumes the task is sleeping (in __switch_to()) and fetches SP and BLINK
from kernel mode stack.

But this assumption is not true, specially in a SMP system, when top
runs on 1 core, there may be active running processes on all cores.

So when unwinding non courrent tasks, ensure they are NOT running.

And while at it, handle the self unwinding case explicitly.

This came out of investigation of a customer reported hang with
rcutorture+top
