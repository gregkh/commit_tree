scsi: mpt3sas: Fix ioctl timeout

Commit c1a6c5ac4278 ("scsi: mpt3sas: For NVME device, issue a protocol
level reset") modified the ioctl path 'timeout' variable type to u8 from
unsigned long, limiting the maximum timeout value that the driver can
support to 255 seconds.

If the management application is requesting a higher value the resulting
timeout will be zero. The operation times out immediately and the ioctl
request fails.

Change datatype back to unsigned long.
