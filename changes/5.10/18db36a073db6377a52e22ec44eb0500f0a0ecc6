docs: ABI: testing: iio: stm32: remove re-introduced unsupported ABI

Remove unsupported ABI that has been re-introduced due to a rebase hunk.
This ABI has been moved in the past in commit b299d00420e2
("IIO: stm32: Remove quadrature related functions from trigger driver")

This also fixes a couple of warnings seen with:
./scripts/get_abi.pl validate 2>&1|grep iio
