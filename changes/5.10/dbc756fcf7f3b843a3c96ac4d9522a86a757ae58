crypto: inside-secure - Add support for EIP197 with output classifier

This patch adds support for EIP197 instances that include the output
classifier (OCE) option, as used by one of our biggest customers.
The OCE normally requires initialization and dedicated firmware, but
for the simple operations supported by this driver, we just bypass it
completely for now (using what is formally a debug feature).
