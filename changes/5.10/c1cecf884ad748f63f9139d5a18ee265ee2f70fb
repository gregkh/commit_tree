sched: Cache task_struct::flags in sched_submit_work()

sched_submit_work() is considered to be a hot path. The preempt_disable()
instruction is a compiler barrier and forces the compiler to load
task_struct::flags for the second comparison.
By using a local variable, the compiler can load the value once and keep it in
a register for the second comparison.

Verified on x86-64 with gcc-10.
