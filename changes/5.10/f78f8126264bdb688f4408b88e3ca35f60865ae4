scsi: qedf: Fix for the session’s E_D_TOV value

Firmware expects E_D_TOV field in connection offload parameters as “msec”.
Earlier incorrect value (100ms), was leading to abort from driver in the
case when data frames for read take more than 100ms from target side,
resulting in firmware reporting E_D_TOV expiration.
