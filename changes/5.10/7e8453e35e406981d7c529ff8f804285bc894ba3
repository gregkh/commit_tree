ath11k: fix a double free and a memory leak

clang static analyzer reports this problem

mac.c:6204:2: warning: Attempt to free released memory
        kfree(ar->mac.sbands[NL80211_BAND_2GHZ].channels);
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The channels pointer is allocated in ath11k_mac_setup_channels_rates()
When it fails midway, it cleans up the memory it has already allocated.
So the error handling needs to skip freeing the memory.

There is a second problem.
ath11k_mac_setup_channels_rates(), allocates 3 channels. err_free
misses releasing ar->mac.sbands[NL80211_BAND_6GHZ].channels
