RDMA/rxe: Remove duplicate entries in struct rxe_mr

Struct rxe_mem had pd, lkey and rkey values both in itself and in the
struct ib_mr which is also included in rxe_mem.

Delete these entries and replace references with the ones in ibmr.Add
mr_pd, mr_lkey and mr_rkey macros which extract these values from mr.
