ext4: correctly report "not supported" for {usr,grp}jquota when !CONFIG_QUOTA

The macro MOPT_Q is used to indicates the mount option is related to
quota stuff and is defined to be MOPT_NOSUPPORT when CONFIG_QUOTA is
disabled.  Normally the quota options are handled explicitly, so it
didn't matter that the MOPT_STRING flag was missing, even though the
usrjquota and grpjquota mount options take a string argument.  It's
important that's present in the !CONFIG_QUOTA case, since without
MOPT_STRING, the mount option matcher will match usrjquota= followed
by an integer, and will otherwise skip the table entry, and so "mount
option not supported" error message is never reported.

[ Fixed up the commit description to better explain why the fix
  works. --TYT ]
