arm64: tegra: Add label properties for EEPROMs

Populate the label property for the AT24 EEPROMs on the various Jetson
platforms. Note that the name 'module' is used to identify the EEPROM
on the processor module board and the name 'system' is used to identify
the EEPROM on the main base board (which is sometimes referred to as
the carrier board).
