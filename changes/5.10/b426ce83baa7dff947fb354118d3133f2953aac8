bpf: Add classid helper only based on skb->sk

Similarly to 5a52ae4e32a6 ("bpf: Allow to retrieve cgroup v1 classid
from v2 hooks"), add a helper to retrieve cgroup v1 classid solely
based on the skb->sk, so it can be used as key as part of BPF map
lookups out of tc from host ns, in particular given the skb->sk is
retained these days when crossing net ns thanks to 9c4c325252c5
("skbuff: preserve sock reference when scrubbing the skb."). This
is similar to bpf_skb_cgroup_id() which implements the same for v2.
Kubernetes ecosystem is still operating on v1 however, hence net_cls
needs to be used there until this can be dropped in with the v2
helper of bpf_skb_cgroup_id().
