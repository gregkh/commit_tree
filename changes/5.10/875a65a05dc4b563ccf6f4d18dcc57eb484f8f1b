staging: regulator: hi6421v600-regulator: add a driver-specific debug macro

Using dev_dbg() is not too nice, as, instead of printing the
name of the regulator, it prints "regulator.<number>", making
harder to associate what is happening with each ldo line.

So, add a debug-specific macro, which will print the rdev's
name, just like the regulator core.
