ALSA: hda - fix CONTROLLER_IN_GPU macro name

The CONTROLLER_IN_GPU() macro has different semantics than
the similarly named macro in hda_intel.c. The name is also
misleading as the macro is used to apply a Intel HSW/BDW
programming logic for HDA controller clock configuration.
Rename macro to reflect the actual implementation.
