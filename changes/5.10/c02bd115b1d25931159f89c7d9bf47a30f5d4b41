Revert "geneve: pull IP header before ECN decapsulation"

This reverts commit 4179b00c04d1 ("geneve: pull IP header before ECN decapsulation").

Eric says: "network header should have been pulled already before
hitting geneve_rx()". Let's revert the syzbot fix since it's causing
more harm than good, and revisit.
