genirq: Allow interrupts to be excluded from /proc/interrupts

A number of architectures implement IPI statistics directly,
duplicating the core kstat_irqs accounting. As we move IPIs to
being actual IRQs, we would end-up with a confusing display
in /proc/interrupts (where the IPIs would appear twice).

In order to solve this, allow interrupts to be flagged as
"hidden", which excludes them from /proc/interrupts.
