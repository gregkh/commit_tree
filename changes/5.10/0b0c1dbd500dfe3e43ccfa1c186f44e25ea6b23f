ARM: 9006/1: uncompress: Wait for ready and busy in debug prints

For some platforms such as Qualcomm we need to wait for the
UART to be ready before writing characters to the UART
in the same manner as the macro in debug.S used with the
main "Uncompressing Linux ..." text. Pass an extra temporary
variable to writeb and make it call waituarttxrdy and
busyuart just like the other decomression messages.

Optionally it will also call waituartcts if and only if
CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_FLOW_CONTROL is selected.

After this the decompression debug messages work fine on
Qualcomm platforms if you compile head.S with -DDEBUG.
