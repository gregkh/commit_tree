i40e: optimise prefetch page refcount

refcount of rx_buffer page will be added here originally, so prefetchw
is needed, but after commit 1793668c3b8c ("i40e/i40evf: Update code to
better handle incrementing page count"), and refcount is not added
every time, so change prefetchw as prefetch.

Now it mainly services page_address(), but which accesses struct page
only when WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL or HASHED_PAGE_VIRTUAL is defined otherwise
it returns address based on offset, so we prefetch it conditionally.

Jakub suggested to define prefetch_page_address in a common header.
