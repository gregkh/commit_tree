x86/mm/mem_encrypt: Fix definition of PMD_FLAGS_DEC_WP

The PAT bit is in different locations for 4k and 2M/1G page table
entries.

Add a definition for _PAGE_LARGE_CACHE_MASK to represent the three
caching bits (PWT, PCD, PAT), similar to _PAGE_CACHE_MASK for 4k pages,
and use it in the definition of PMD_FLAGS_DEC_WP to get the correct PAT
index for write-protected pages.
