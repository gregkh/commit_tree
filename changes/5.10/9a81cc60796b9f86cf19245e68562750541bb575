drm/amd/display: Reset plane when tiling flags change

[Why]
Enabling or disable DCC or switching between tiled and linear formats
can require bandwidth updates.

They're currently skipping all DC validation by being treated as purely
surface updates.

[How]
Treat tiling_flag changes (which encode DCC state) as a condition for
resetting the plane.
