arm64: dts: qcom: Makefile: Sort lines

The Makefile is in a bit of a weird order at the moment.
It's almost sorted alphabetically, but not entirely.
Also, one element uses a space before the += instead of a tab.

Fix this up and sort the lines alphabetically so we have
a consistent order in the Makefile.
