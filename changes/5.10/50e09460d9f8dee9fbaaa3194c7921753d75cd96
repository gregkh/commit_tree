libbpf: Skip well-known ELF sections when iterating ELF

Skip and don't log ELF sections that libbpf knows about and ignores during ELF
processing. This allows to not unnecessarily log details about those ELF
sections and cleans up libbpf debug log. Ignored sections include DWARF data,
string table, empty .text section and few special (e.g., .llvm_addrsig)
useless sections.

With such ELF sections out of the way, log unrecognized ELF sections at
pr_info level to increase visibility.
