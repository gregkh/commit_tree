ASoC: Intel: atom: Remove duplicate kconfigs

SND_SST_IPC and its _PCI and _ACPI variants all target
sound/soc/intel/atom solution alone. SND_SST_IPC is the core component,
required for PCI and ACPI based atom platforms both. _PCI and _ACPI
target Merrifield/Edison and Baytrial/Cherrytrail platforms
respectively.

On top of that, there is an equivalent set of configs targeting the same
solution:
- SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM (core)
- SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM_PCI
- SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM_ACPI

As both sets do the same job - allow for granular platform selection -
remove the duplicate set and rely on SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATOFRM_XXX
configs alone.
