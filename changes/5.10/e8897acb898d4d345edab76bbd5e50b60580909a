media: netup_unidvb: drop initialization of PM pointers

The .suspend() and .resume() callbacks are not defined for this driver.
Thus, just the unlisting of PM pointers in the struct initializer will make
no change in its behavior. Still unlisting is necessary so as to get rid of
.suspend and .resume pointers as they are part of the legacy framework and
should not be used in the driver code explicitly.
