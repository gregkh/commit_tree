bus: ti-sysc: suppress err msg for timers used as clockevent/source

GP Timers used as clockevent/source are not available for ti-sysc bus and
handled by Kernel timekeeping core. Now ti-sysc produces error message
every time such timer is detected:

 "ti-sysc: probe of 48040000.target-module failed with error -16"

Such messages are not necessary, so suppress them by returning -ENXIO
instead of -EBUSY.
