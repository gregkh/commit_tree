block: allow 'chunk_sectors' to be non-power-of-2

It is possible, albeit more unlikely, for a block device to have a non
power-of-2 for chunk_sectors (e.g. 10+2 RAID6 with 128K chunk_sectors,
which results in a full-stripe size of 1280K. This causes the RAID6's
io_opt to be advertised as 1280K, and a stacked device _could_ then be
made to use a blocksize, aka chunk_sectors, that matches non power-of-2
io_opt of underlying RAID6 -- resulting in stacked device's
chunk_sectors being a non power-of-2).

Update blk_queue_chunk_sectors() and blk_max_size_offset() to
accommodate drivers that need a non power-of-2 chunk_sectors.
