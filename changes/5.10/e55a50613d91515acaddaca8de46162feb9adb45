power: supply: max17040: Use devm_ to automate remove

Two actions were performed during remove - power supply dereg and
delayed work cleanup. Power supply dereg can be handled by using the
devm_ version of the registration function. Work cleanup can be added as
a devm_action.

If probe fails after psy registration it will now be cleaned up
properly.
