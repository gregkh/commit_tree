drm/i915/hdcp: Add update_pipe early return

Currently intel_hdcp_update_pipe() is also getting called for non-hdcp
connectors and get through its conditional code flow, which is completely
unnecessary for non-hdcp connectors, therefore it make sense to
have an early return. No functional change.

v2:
- rebased.
