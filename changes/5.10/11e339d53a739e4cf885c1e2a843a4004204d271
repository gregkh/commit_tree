arm64/mm: Remove CONT_RANGE_OFFSET

The macro was introduced by commit <ecf35a237a85> ("arm64: PTE/PMD
contiguous bit definition") at the beginning. It's only used by
commit <348a65cdcbbf> ("arm64: Mark kernel page ranges contiguous"),
which was reverted later by commit <667c27597ca8>. This makes the
macro unused.

This removes the unused macro (CONT_RANGE_OFFSET).
