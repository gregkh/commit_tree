erofs: fix setting up pcluster for temporary pages

pcluster should be only set up for all managed pages instead of
temporary pages. Since it currently uses page->mapping to identify,
the impact is minor for now.

[ Update: Vladimir reported the kernel log becomes polluted
  because PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_FREE flag(s) set if the page
  allocation debug option is enabled. ]
