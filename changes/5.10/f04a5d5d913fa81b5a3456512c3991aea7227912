mm/page_alloc: convert "report" flag of __free_one_page() to a proper flag

Patch series "mm: place pages to the freelist tail when onlining and undoing isolation", v2.

When adding separate memory blocks via add_memory*() and onlining them
immediately, the metadata (especially the memmap) of the next block will
be placed onto one of the just added+onlined block.  This creates a chain
of unmovable allocations: If the last memory block cannot get
offlined+removed() so will all dependent ones.  We directly have unmovable
allocations all over the place.

This can be observed quite easily using virtio-mem, however, it can also
be observed when using DIMMs.  The freshly onlined pages will usually be
placed to the head of the freelists, meaning they will be allocated next,
turning the just-added memory usually immediately un-removable.  The fresh
pages are cold, prefering to allocate others (that might be hot) also
feels to be the natural thing to do.

It also applies to the hyper-v balloon xen-balloon, and ppc64 dlpar: when
adding separate, successive memory blocks, each memory block will have
unmovable allocations on them - for example gigantic pages will fail to
allocate.

While the ZONE_NORMAL doesn't provide any guarantees that memory can get
offlined+removed again (any kind of fragmentation with unmovable
allocations is possible), there are many scenarios (hotplugging a lot of
memory, running workload, hotunplug some memory/as much as possible) where
we can offline+remove quite a lot with this patchset.

a) To visualize the problem, a very simple example:

Start a VM with 4GB and 8GB of virtio-mem memory:

 [root@localhost ~]# lsmem
 RANGE                                 SIZE  STATE REMOVABLE  BLOCK
 0x0000000000000000-0x00000000bfffffff   3G online       yes   0-23
 0x0000000100000000-0x000000033fffffff   9G online       yes 32-103

 Memory block size:       128M
 Total online memory:      12G
 Total offline memory:      0B

Then try to unplug as much as possible using virtio-mem. Observe which
memory blocks are still around. Without this patch set:

 [root@localhost ~]# lsmem
 RANGE                                  SIZE  STATE REMOVABLE   BLOCK

 Memory block size:       128M
 Total online memory:     8.1G
 Total offline memory:      0B

With this patch set:

 [root@localhost ~]# lsmem
 RANGE                                 SIZE  STATE REMOVABLE BLOCK
 0x0000000000000000-0x00000000bfffffff   3G online       yes  0-23
 0x0000000100000000-0x000000013fffffff   1G online       yes 32-39

 Memory block size:       128M
 Total online memory:       4G
 Total offline memory:      0B

All memory can get unplugged, all memory block can get removed.  Of
course, no workload ran and the system was basically idle, but it
highlights the issue - the fairly deterministic chain of unmovable
allocations.  When a huge page for the 2MB memmap is needed, a
just-onlined 4MB page will be split.  The remaining 2MB page will be used
for the memmap of the next memory block.  So one memory block will hold
the memmap of the two following memory blocks.  Finally the pages of the
last-onlined memory block will get used for the next bigger allocations -
if any allocation is unmovable, all dependent memory blocks cannot get
unplugged and removed until that allocation is gone.

Note that with bigger memory blocks (e.g., 256MB), *all* memory
blocks are dependent and none can get unplugged again!

b) Experiment with memory intensive workload

I performed an experiment with an older version of this patch set (before
we used undo_isolate_page_range() in online_pages(): Hotplug 56GB to a VM
with an initial 4GB, onlining all memory to ZONE_NORMAL right from the
kernel when adding it.  I then run various memory intensive workloads that
consume most system memory for a total of 45 minutes.  Once finished, I
try to unplug as much memory as possible.

With this change, I am able to remove via virtio-mem (adding individual
128MB memory blocks) 413 out of 448 added memory blocks.  Via individual
(256MB) DIMMs 380 out of 448 added memory blocks.  (I don't have any
numbers without this patchset, but looking at the above example, it's at
most half of the 448 memory blocks for virtio-mem, and most probably none
for DIMMs).

Again, there are workloads that might behave very differently due to the
nature of ZONE_NORMAL.

This change also affects (besides memory onlining):
- Other users of undo_isolate_page_range(): Pages are always placed to the
  tail.
-- When memory offlining fails
-- When memory isolation fails after having isolated some pageblocks
-- When alloc_contig_range() either succeeds or fails
- Other users of __putback_isolated_page(): Pages are always placed to the
  tail.
-- Free page reporting
- Other users of __free_pages_core()
-- AFAIKs, any memory that is getting exposed to the buddy during boot.
   IIUC we will now usually allocate memory from lower addresses within
   a zone first (especially during boot).
- Other users of generic_online_page()
-- Hyper-V balloon

This patch (of 5):

Let's prepare for additional flags and avoid long parameter lists of
bools.  Follow-up patches will also make use of the flags in
__free_pages_ok().
