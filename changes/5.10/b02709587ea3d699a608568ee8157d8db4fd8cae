bpf: Fix propagation of 32-bit signed bounds from 64-bit bounds.

The 64-bit signed bounds should not affect 32-bit signed bounds unless the
verifier knows that upper 32-bits are either all 1s or all 0s. For example the
register with smin_value==1 doesn't mean that s32_min_value is also equal to 1,
since smax_value could be larger than 32-bit subregister can hold.
The verifier refines the smax/s32_max return value from certain helpers in
do_refine_retval_range(). Teach the verifier to recognize that smin/s32_min
value is also bounded. When both smin and smax bounds fit into 32-bit
subregister the verifier can propagate those bounds.
