RDMA/qedr: Fix inline size returned for iWARP

commit 59e8970b3798 ("RDMA/qedr: Return max inline data in QP query
result") changed query_qp max_inline size to return the max roce inline
size.  When iwarp was introduced, this should have been modified to return
the max inline size based on protocol.  This size is cached in the device
attributes
