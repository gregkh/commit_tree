drm/i915: Update bw_buddy pagemask table

A recent bspec update removed the LPDDR4 single channel entry from the
buddy register table, but added a new four-channel entry.

Workaround 1409767108 hasn't been updated with any guidance for four
channel configurations, so we leave that alternate table unchanged for
now.
