SMB3: Resolve data corruption of TCP server info fields

TCP server info field server->total_read is modified in parallel by
demultiplex thread and decrypt offload worker thread. server->total_read
is used in calculation to discard the remaining data of PDU which is
not read into memory.

Because of parallel modification, server->total_read can get corrupted
and can result in discarding the valid data of next PDU.
