drivers: gpu: amd: Initialize amdgpu_dm_backlight_caps object to 0 in amdgpu_dm_update_backlight_caps

In `amdgpu_dm_update_backlight_caps()`, there is a local
`amdgpu_dm_backlight_caps` object that is filled in by
`amdgpu_acpi_get_backlight_caps()`. However, this object is
uninitialized before the call and hence the subsequent check for
aux_support can fail since it is not initialized by
`amdgpu_acpi_get_backlight_caps()` as well. This change initializes
this local `amdgpu_dm_backlight_caps` object to 0.
