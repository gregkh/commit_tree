pwm: cros-ec: Accept more error codes from cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status

Since commit c5cd2b47b203 ("platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: Report command
not supported") we can no longer assume that cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status()
reports -EPROTO for all errors returned by the EC itself. A follow-up
patch will change cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status() to report additional errors
reported by the EC as distinguished Linux error codes.

Handle this change by no longer assuming that only -EPROTO is used
to report all errors returned by the EC itself. Instead, support both
the old and the new error codes.

Add a comment describing cros_ec_num_pwms() to explain its functionality.
