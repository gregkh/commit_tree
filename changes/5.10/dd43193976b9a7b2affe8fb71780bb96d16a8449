hwmon (pmbus) use simple i2c probe function

pmbus_do_probe doesn't use the id information provided in its second
argument, so this can be removed, which then allows using the
single-parameter i2c probe function ("probe_new") for probes.

This avoids scanning the identifier tables during probes.

Drivers which didn't use the id are converted as-is; drivers which did
are modified as follows:

* if the information in i2c_client is sufficient, that's used instead
  (client->name);
* configured v. probed comparisons are performed by comparing the
  configured name to the detected name, instead of the ids; this
  involves strcmp but is still cheaper than comparing all the device
  names when scanning the tables;
* anything else is handled by calling i2c_match_id() with the same
  level of error-handling (if any) as before.

Additionally, the mismatch message in the ltc2978 driver is adjusted
so that it no longer assumes that the driver_data is an index into
ltc2978_id.
