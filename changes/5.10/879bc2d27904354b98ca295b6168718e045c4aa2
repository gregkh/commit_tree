hil/parisc: Disable HIL driver when it gets stuck

When starting a HP machine with HIL driver but without an HIL keyboard
or HIL mouse attached, it may happen that data written to the HIL loop
gets stuck (e.g. because the transaction queue is full).  Usually one
will then have to reboot the machine because all you see is and endless
output of:
 Transaction add failed: transaction already queued?

In the higher layers hp_sdc_enqueue_transaction() is called to queued up
a HIL packet. This function returns an error code, and this patch adds
the necessary checks for this return code and disables the HIL driver if
further packets can't be sent.

Tested on a HP 730 and a HP 715/64 machine.
