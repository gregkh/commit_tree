net: Exempt multicast addresses from five-second neighbor lifetime

Commit 58956317c8de ("neighbor: Improve garbage collection")
guarantees neighbour table entries a five-second lifetime.  Processes
which make heavy use of multicast can fill the neighour table with
multicast addresses in five seconds.  At that point, neighbour entries
can't be GC-ed because they aren't five seconds old yet, the kernel
log starts to fill up with "neighbor table overflow!" messages, and
sends start to fail.

This patch allows multicast addresses to be thrown out before they've
lived out their five seconds.  This makes room for non-multicast
addresses and makes messages to all addresses more reliable in these
circumstances.
