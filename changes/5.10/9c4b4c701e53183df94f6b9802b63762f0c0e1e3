arm64/sve: Implement a helper to load SVE registers from FPSIMD state

In a follow-up patch, we may save the FPSIMD rather than the full SVE
state when the state has to be zeroed on return to userspace (e.g
during a syscall).

Introduce an helper to load SVE vectors from FPSIMD state and zero the rest
of SVE registers.
