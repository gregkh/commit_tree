mtd: nand: Introduce the ECC engine framework

Create a generic ECC engine framework. This is a base to instantiate ECC
engine objects.

If we really want to be generic, bindings must evolve, so here is the
new logic. The following three properties are mutually exclusive:
- The nand-no-ecc-engine boolean property is set and there is no
  ECC engine to retrieve.
- The nand-use-soft-ecc-engine boolean property is set and the core
  will force using the use of software correction.
- There is a nand-ecc-engine property pointing at a node which will
  act as ECC engine.

It the later case, the property may reference:
- The NAND chip node itself (for the on-die ECC case).
- The parent node if the NAND controller embeds an ECC engine.
- Any other node being an external ECC controller as well.
