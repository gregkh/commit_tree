crypto: x86/poly1305 - add back a needed assignment

One of the assignments that was removed by commit 4a0c1de64bf9 ("crypto:
x86/poly1305 - Remove assignments with no effect") is actually needed,
since it affects the return value.

This fixes the following crypto self-test failure:

    alg: shash: poly1305-simd test failed (wrong result) on test vector 2, cfg="init+update+final aligned buffer"
