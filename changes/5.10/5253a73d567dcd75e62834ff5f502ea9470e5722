ASoC: SOF: Add topology filename override based on dmi data match

Add topology filename override based on system DMI data matching,
typically to account for a different hardware layout.

In ACPI based systems, the tplg_filename is pre-defined in an ACPI
machine table. When a DMI quirk is detected, the
sof_pdata->tplg_filename is not set with the hard-coded ACPI value,
and instead is set with the DMI-specific filename.
