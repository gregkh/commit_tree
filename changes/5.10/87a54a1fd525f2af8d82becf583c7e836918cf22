perf/amd/uncore: Allow F19h user coreid, threadmask, and sliceid specification

On Family 19h, the driver checks for a populated 2-bit threadmask in
order to establish that the user wants to measure individual slices,
individual cores (only one can be measured at a time), and lets
the user also directly specify enallcores and/or enallslices if
desired.

Example F19h invocation to measure L3 accesses (event 4, umask 0xff)
by the first thread (id 0 -> mask 0x1) of the first core (id 0) on the
first slice (id 0):

perf stat -a -e instructions,amd_l3/umask=0xff,event=0x4,coreid=0,threadmask=1,sliceid=0,enallcores=0,enallslices=0/ <workload>
