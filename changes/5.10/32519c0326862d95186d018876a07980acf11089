docs: kasan.rst: add two missing blank lines

literal blocks should start and end with a blank line,
as otherwise the parser complains and may do the wrong
thing, as warned by Sphinx:

	Documentation/dev-tools/kasan.rst:298: WARNING: Literal block ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
	Documentation/dev-tools/kasan.rst:303: WARNING: Literal block ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
