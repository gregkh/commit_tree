printk: move dictionary keys to dev_printk_info

Dictionaries are only used for SUBSYSTEM and DEVICE properties. The
current implementation stores the property names each time they are
used. This requires more space than otherwise necessary. Also,
because the dictionary entries are currently considered optional,
it cannot be relied upon that they are always available, even if the
writer wanted to store them. These issues will increase should new
dictionary properties be introduced.

Rather than storing the subsystem and device properties in the
dict ring, introduce a struct dev_printk_info with separate fields
to store only the property values. Embed this struct within the
struct printk_info to provide guaranteed availability.
