media: staging: rkisp1: rsz: enumerate the formats on the src pad according to the capture

Currently the resizer outputs the same media bus format
as the input. This is wrong since the resizer is also used
to downscale YUV formats. This patch changes the enumeration
of the supported formats. The supported formats on the sink pad
should be taken from the isp entity and the supported formats on
the source pad should be taken from the capture entity.
