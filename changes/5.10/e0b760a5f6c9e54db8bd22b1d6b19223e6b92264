arm64: dts: sdm845: Fixup OPP table for all qup devices

This OPP table was based on the clock VDD-FMAX tables seen in
downstream code, however it turns out the downstream clock
driver does update these tables based on later/production
rev of the chip and whats seen in the tables belongs to an
early engineering rev of the SoC.
Fix up the OPP tables such that it now matches with the
production rev of sdm845 SoC.
