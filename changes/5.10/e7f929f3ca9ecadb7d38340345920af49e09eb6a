checkpatch: extend author Signed-off-by check for split From: header

Checkpatch did not handle cases where the author From: header was split
into multiple lines.  The author identity could not be resolved and
checkpatch generated a false NO_AUTHOR_SIGN_OFF warning.

A typical example is commit e33bcbab16d1 ("tee: add support for session's
client UUID generation").  When checkpatch was run on this commit, it
displayed:

"WARNING:NO_AUTHOR_SIGN_OFF: Missing Signed-off-by: line by nominal
patch author ''"

This was due to split header lines not being handled properly and the
author himself wrote in commit cd2614967d8b ("checkpatch: warn if missing
author Signed-off-by"):

"Split From: headers are not fully handled: only the first part
is compared."

Support split From: headers by correctly parsing the header extension
lines.  RFC 5322, Section-2.2.3 stated that each extended line must start
with a WSP character (a space or htab).  The solution was therefore to
concatenate the lines which start with a WSP to get the correct long
header.
