KVM: SVM: Don't flush cache if hardware enforces cache coherency across encryption domains

In some hardware implementations, coherency between the encrypted and
unencrypted mappings of the same physical page in a VM is enforced. In
such a system, it is not required for software to flush the VM's page
from all CPU caches in the system prior to changing the value of the
C-bit for the page.

So check that bit before flushing the cache.
