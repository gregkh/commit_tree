selftests/bpf: Ksyms_btf to test typed ksyms

Selftests for typed ksyms. Tests two types of ksyms: one is a struct,
the other is a plain int. This tests two paths in the kernel. Struct
ksyms will be converted into PTR_TO_BTF_ID by the verifier while int
typed ksyms will be converted into PTR_TO_MEM.
