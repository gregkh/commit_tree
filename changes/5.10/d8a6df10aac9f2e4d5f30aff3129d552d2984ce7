io_uring: use percpu counters to track inflight requests

Even though we place the req_issued and req_complete in separate
cachelines, there's considerable overhead in doing the atomics
particularly on the completion side.

Get rid of having the two counters, and just use a percpu_counter for
this. That's what it was made for, after all. This considerably
reduces the overhead in __io_free_req().
