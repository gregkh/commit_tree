clk: qcom: gcc-msm8994: Add missing clocks, resets and GDSCs

This change adds GDSCs, resets and most of the missing
clocks to the msm8994 GCC driver. The remaining ones
are of local_vote_clk and gate_clk type, which are not
yet supported upstream. Also reorder them to match the
original downstream driver.
