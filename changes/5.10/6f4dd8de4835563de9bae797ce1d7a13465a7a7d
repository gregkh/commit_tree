mm: remove superfluous __ClearPageActive()

To activate a page, mark_page_accessed() always holds a reference on it.
It either gets a new reference when adding a page to
lru_pvecs.activate_page or reuses an existing one it previously got when
it added a page to lru_pvecs.lru_add.  So it doesn't call SetPageActive()
on a page that doesn't have any reference left.  Therefore, the race is
impossible these days (I didn't brother to dig into its history).

For other paths, namely reclaim and migration, a reference count is always
held while calling SetPageActive() on a page.

SetPageSlabPfmemalloc() also uses SetPageActive(), but it's irrelevant to
LRU pages.
