ibmvnic: Ensure that SCRQ entry reads are correctly ordered

Ensure that received Subordinate Command-Response Queue (SCRQ)
entries are properly read in order by the driver. These queues
are used in the ibmvnic device to process RX buffer and TX completion
descriptors. dma_rmb barriers have been added after checking for a
pending descriptor to ensure the correct descriptor entry is checked
and after reading the SCRQ descriptor to ensure the entire
descriptor is read before processing.
