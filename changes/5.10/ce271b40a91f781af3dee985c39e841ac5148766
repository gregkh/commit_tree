drm/amd/display: Screen corruption on dual displays (DP+USB-C)

[why]
Current pipe merge and split logic only supports cases where new
dc_state is allocated and relies on dc->current_state to gather
information from previous dc_state.

Calls to validate_bandwidth on UPDATE_TYPE_MED would cause an issue
because there is no new dc_state allocated, and data in
dc->current_state would be overwritten during pipe merge.

[how]
Only allow validate_bandwidth when new dc_state space is created.
