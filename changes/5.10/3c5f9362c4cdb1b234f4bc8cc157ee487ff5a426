media: open.rst: remove the minor number range

minor numbers use to range between 0 to 255, but that
was changed a long time ago. While it still applies when
CONFIG_VIDEO_FIXED_MINOR_RANGES, when the minor number is
dynamically allocated, this may not be true. In any case,
this is not relevant, as udev will take care of it.

So, remove this useless misinformation.
