powerpc/mm/book3s: Split radix and hash MAX_PHYSMEM limit

MAX_PHYSMEM #define is used along with sparsemem to determine the SECTION_SHIFT
value. Powerpc also uses the same value to limit the max memory enabled on the
system. With 4K PAGE_SIZE and hash translation mode, we want to limit the max
memory enabled to 64TB due to page table size restrictions. However, with
radix translation, we don't have these restrictions. Hence split the radix
and hash MA_PHYSMEM limit and use different limit for each of them.
