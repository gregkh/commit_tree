selftests/bpf: Fix stat probe in d_path test

Some kernels builds might inline vfs_getattr call within fstat
syscall code path, so fentry/vfs_getattr trampoline is not called.

Add security_inode_getattr to allowlist and switch the d_path test stat
trampoline to security_inode_getattr.

Keeping dentry_open and filp_close, because they are in their own
files, so unlikely to be inlined, but in case they are, adding
security_file_open.

Adding flags that indicate trampolines were called and failing
the test if any of them got missed, so it's easier to identify
the issue next time.
