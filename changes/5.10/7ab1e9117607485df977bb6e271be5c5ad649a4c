interconnect: qcom: qcs404: Remove GPU and display RPM IDs

The following errors are noticed during boot on a QCS404 board:
[    2.926647] qcom_icc_rpm_smd_send mas 6 error -6
[    2.934573] qcom_icc_rpm_smd_send mas 8 error -6

These errors show when we try to configure the GPU and display nodes.
Since these particular nodes aren't supported on RPM and are purely
local, we should just change their mas_rpm_id to -1 to avoid any
requests being sent for these master IDs.
