seqlock: seqcount_LOCKNAME_t: Standardize naming convention

At seqlock.h, sequence counters with associated locks are either called
seqcount_LOCKNAME_t, seqcount_LOCKTYPE_t, or seqcount_locktype_t.

Standardize on seqcount_LOCKNAME_t for all instances in comments,
kernel-doc, and SEQCOUNT_LOCKNAME() generative macro paramters.
