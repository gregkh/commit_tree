ARM: dts: exynos: Override thermal by label in Exynos4210

Using full paths to extend or override a device tree node is error prone
since if there was a typo error, a new node will be created instead of
extending the node as it was desired.  This will lead to run-time errors
that could be hard to detect.

A mistyped label on the other hand, will cause a dtc compile error
(during build time).
