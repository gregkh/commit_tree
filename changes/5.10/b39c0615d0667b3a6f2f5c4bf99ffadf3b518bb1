pwm: img: Fix null pointer access in probe

dev_get_drvdata() is called in img_pwm_runtime_resume() before the
driver data is set.
When pm_runtime_enabled() returns false in img_pwm_probe() it calls
img_pwm_runtime_resume() which results in a null pointer access.

This patch fixes the problem by setting the driver data earlier in the
img_pwm_probe() function.

This crash was seen when booting the Imagination Technologies Creator
Ci40 (Marduk) with kernel 5.4 in OpenWrt.
