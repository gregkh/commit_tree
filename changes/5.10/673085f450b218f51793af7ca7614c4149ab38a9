ARM: s3c24xx: move iis pinctrl config into boards

The s3c_gpio_cfgall_range() function is an internal interface of the
samsung gpio driver and should not be called directly by drivers, so
move the iis pin initialization into the boards.

This means the pin configuration is only run once at early boot, rather
than each time the driver binds, but the effect should be the same.

Note that the s3c2412-i2s driver has no boards using it in mainline linux,
the driver gets selected for the jive machine but is never instantiated.
