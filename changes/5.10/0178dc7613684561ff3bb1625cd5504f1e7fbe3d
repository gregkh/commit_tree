arm64: mte: Use Normal Tagged attributes for the linear map

Once user space is given access to tagged memory, the kernel must be
able to clear/save/restore tags visible to the user. This is done via
the linear mapping, therefore map it as such. The new MT_NORMAL_TAGGED
index for MAIR_EL1 is initially mapped as Normal memory and later
changed to Normal Tagged via the cpufeature infrastructure. From a
mismatched attribute aliases perspective, the Tagged memory is
considered a permission and it won't lead to undefined behaviour.
