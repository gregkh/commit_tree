dma-mapping: introduce DMA range map, supplanting dma_pfn_offset

The new field 'dma_range_map' in struct device is used to facilitate the
use of single or multiple offsets between mapping regions of cpu addrs and
dma addrs.  It subsumes the role of "dev->dma_pfn_offset" which was only
capable of holding a single uniform offset and had no region bounds
checking.

The function of_dma_get_range() has been modified so that it takes a single
argument -- the device node -- and returns a map, NULL, or an error code.
The map is an array that holds the information regarding the DMA regions.
Each range entry contains the address offset, the cpu_start address, the
dma_start address, and the size of the region.

of_dma_configure() is the typical manner to set range offsets but there are
a number of ad hoc assignments to "dev->dma_pfn_offset" in the kernel
driver code.  These cases now invoke the function
dma_direct_set_offset(dev, cpu_addr, dma_addr, size).
