iov_iter: transparently handle compat iovecs in import_iovec

Use in compat_syscall to import either native or the compat iovecs, and
remove the now superflous compat_import_iovec.

This removes the need for special compat logic in most callers, and
the remaining ones can still be simplified by using __import_iovec
with a bool compat parameter.
