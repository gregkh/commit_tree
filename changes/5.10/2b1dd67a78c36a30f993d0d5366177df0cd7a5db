mm/debug_vm_pgtable/hugetlb: disable hugetlb test on ppc64

The seems to be missing quite a lot of details w.r.t allocating the
correct pgtable_t page (huge_pte_alloc()), holding the right lock
(huge_pte_lock()) etc.  The vma used is also not a hugetlb VMA.

ppc64 do have runtime checks within CONFIG_DEBUG_VM for most of these.
Hence disable the test on ppc64.
