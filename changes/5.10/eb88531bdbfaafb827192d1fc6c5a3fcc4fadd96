can: raw: add missing error queue support

Error queue are not yet implemented in CAN-raw sockets.

The problem: a userland call to recvmsg(soc, msg, MSG_ERRQUEUE) on a
CAN-raw socket would unqueue messages from the normal queue without
any kind of error or warning. As such, it prevented CAN drivers from
using the functionalities that relies on the error queue such as
skb_tx_timestamp().

SCM_CAN_RAW_ERRQUEUE is defined as the type for the CAN raw error
queue. SCM stands for "Socket control messages". The name is inspired
from SCM_J1939_ERRQUEUE of include/uapi/linux/can/j1939.h.
