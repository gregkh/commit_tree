arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180-trogdor: add initial trogdor and lazor dt

This is essentialy a squash of a bunch of history of trogdor and lazor
dt updates from the chromium kernel tree.

I don't claim any credit other than wanting to more easily boot upstream
kernel on these devices.

I've tried to add cc tags for all the original authors.
