ip_gre: set dev->hard_header_len and dev->needed_headroom properly

GRE tunnel has its own header_ops, ipgre_header_ops, and sets it
conditionally. When it is set, it assumes the outer IP header is
already created before ipgre_xmit().

This is not true when we send packets through a raw packet socket,
where L2 headers are supposed to be constructed by user. Packet
socket calls dev_validate_header() to validate the header. But
GRE tunnel does not set dev->hard_header_len, so that check can
be simply bypassed, therefore uninit memory could be passed down
to ipgre_xmit(). Similar for dev->needed_headroom.

dev->hard_header_len is supposed to be the length of the header
created by dev->header_ops->create(), so it should be used whenever
header_ops is set, and dev->needed_headroom should be used when it
is not set.
