x86/perf, static_call: Optimize x86_pmu methods

Replace many of the indirect calls with static_call().

The average PMI time, as measured by perf_sample_event_took()*:

  PRE:    3283.03 [ns]
  POST:   3145.12 [ns]

Which is a ~138 [ns] win per PMI, or a ~4.2% decrease.

[*] on an IVB-EP, using: 'perf record -a -e cycles -- make O=defconfig-build/ -j80'
