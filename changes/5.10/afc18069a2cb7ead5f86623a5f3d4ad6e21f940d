x86/kexec: Use up-to-dated screen_info copy to fill boot params

kexec_file_load() currently reuses the old boot_params.screen_info,
but if drivers have change the hardware state, boot_param.screen_info
could contain invalid info.

For example, the video type might be no longer VGA, or the frame buffer
address might be changed. If the kexec kernel keeps using the old screen_info,
kexec'ed kernel may attempt to write to an invalid framebuffer
memory region.

There are two screen_info instances globally available, boot_params.screen_info
and screen_info. Later one is a copy, and is updated by drivers.

So let kexec_file_load use the updated copy.
