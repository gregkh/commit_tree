x86/kaslr: Make the type of number of slots/slot areas consistent

The number of slots can be 'unsigned int', since on 64-bit, the maximum
amount of memory is 2^52, the minimum alignment is 2^21, so the slot
number cannot be greater than 2^31. But in case future processors have
more than 52 physical address bits, make it 'unsigned long'.

The slot areas are limited by MAX_SLOT_AREA, currently 100. It is
indexed by an int, but the number of areas is stored as 'unsigned long'.
Change both to 'unsigned int' for consistency.
