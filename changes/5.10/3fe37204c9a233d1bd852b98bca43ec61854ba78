gpio: dwapb: Fix missing conversion to GPIO-lib-based IRQ-chip

Commit 0ea683931adb ("gpio: dwapb: Convert driver to using the
GPIO-lib-based IRQ-chip") missed the case in dwapb_irq_set_wake().

Without this fix, probing the dwapb gpio driver will hit a error:
"address between user and kernel address ranges" on a Ampere armv8a
server and cause a panic.
