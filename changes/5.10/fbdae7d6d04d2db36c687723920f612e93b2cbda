ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Fix HP Pavilion x2 Detachable quirks

The HP Pavilion x2 Detachable line comes in many variants:

1. Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC, Micro-USB charging (10-k010nz, ...)
   DMI_SYS_VENDOR: "Hewlett-Packard"
   DMI_PRODUCT_NAME: "HP Pavilion x2 Detachable PC 10"
   DMI_BOARD_NAME: "8021"

2. Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC, Type-C charging (10-n000nd, 10-n010nl, ...)
   DMI_SYS_VENDOR: "Hewlett-Packard"
   DMI_PRODUCT_NAME: "HP Pavilion x2 Detachable"
   DMI_BOARD_NAME: "815D"

3. Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC, Type-C charging (10-n101ng, ...)
   DMI_SYS_VENDOR: "HP"
   DMI_PRODUCT_NAME: "HP Pavilion x2 Detachable"
   DMI_BOARD_NAME: "813E"

4. Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC, Type-C charging (10-p002nd, 10-p018wm, ...)
   DMI_SYS_VENDOR: "HP"
   DMI_PRODUCT_NAME: "HP x2 Detachable 10-p0XX"
   DMI_BOARD_NAME: "827C"

5. Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC, Type-C charging (x2-210-g2, ...)
   DMI_SYS_VENDOR: "HP"
   DMI_PRODUCT_NAME: "HP x2 210 G2"
   DMI_BOARD_NAME: "82F4"

Variant 1 needs the exact same quirk as variant 2, so relax the DMI check
for the existing quirk a bit so that it matches both variant 1 and 2
(note the other variants will still not match).

Variant 2 already has an existing quirk (which now also matches variant 1)

Variant 3 uses a cx2072x codec, so is not applicable here.

Variant 4 almost works with the defaults, but it also needs a quirk to
fix jack-detection, add a new quirk for this.

Variant 5 does use a RT5640 codec (based on old dmesg output), but was
otherwise not tested, keep using the defaults for this variant.
