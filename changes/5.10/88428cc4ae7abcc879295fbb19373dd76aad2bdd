SUNRPC dont update timeout value on connection reset

Current behaviour: every time a v3 operation is re-sent to the server
we update (double) the timeout. There is no distinction between whether
or not the previous timer had expired before the re-sent happened.

Here's the scenario:
1. Client sends a v3 operation
2. Server RST-s the connection (prior to the timeout) (eg., connection
is immediately reset)
3. Client re-sends a v3 operation but the timeout is now 120sec.

As a result, an application sees 2mins pause before a retry in case
server again does not reply. Where as if a connection reset didn't
change the timeout value, the client would have re-tried (the 3rd
time) after 60secs.
