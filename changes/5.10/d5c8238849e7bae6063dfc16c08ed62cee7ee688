btrfs: convert data_seqcount to seqcount_mutex_t

By doing so we can associate the sequence counter to the chunk_mutex
for lockdep purposes (compiled-out otherwise), the mutex is otherwise
used on the write side.
Also avoid explicitly disabling preemption around the write region as it
will now be done automatically by the seqcount machinery based on the
lock type.
