jbd2: fix up sparse warnings in checkpoint code

Add missing __acquires() and __releases() annotations.  Also, in an
"this should never happen" WARN_ON check, if it *does* actually
happen, we need to release j_state_lock since this function is always
supposed to release that lock.  Otherwise, things will quickly grind
to a halt after the WARN_ON trips.
