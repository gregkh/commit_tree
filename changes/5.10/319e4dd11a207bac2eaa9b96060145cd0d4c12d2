net: mscc: ocelot: introduce conversion helpers between port and netdev

Since the mscc_ocelot_switch_lib is common between a pure switchdev and
a DSA driver, the procedure of retrieving a net_device for a certain
port index differs, as those are registered by their individual
front-ends.

Up to now that has been dealt with by always passing the port index to
the switch library, but now, we're going to need to work with net_device
pointers from the tc-flower offload, for things like indev, or mirred.
It is not desirable to refactor that, so let's make sure that the flower
offload core has the ability to translate between a net_device and a
port index properly.
