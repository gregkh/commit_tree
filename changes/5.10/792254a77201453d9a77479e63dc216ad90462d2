powerpc/security: Fix link stack flush instruction

The inline execution path for the hardware assisted branch flush
instruction failed to set CTR to the correct value before bcctr,
causing a crash when the feature is enabled.

Fixes: 4d24e21cc694 ("powerpc/security: Allow for processors that flush the link stack using the special bcctr")
