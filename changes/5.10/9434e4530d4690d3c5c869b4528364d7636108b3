power: supply: charger-manager: Don't start charging in cable nofitication

Prevents direct charging control in cable notification and only set the
input current limit according to cable type.  Leave the enabling of
charing to cm_monitor() where charging management proceeds.  We may lose
a few ms to enable charging compared to before, but it's more important
that charging is enabled always in safe context.
