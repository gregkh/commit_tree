interconnect: qcom: sc7180: Init BCMs before creating the nodes

Currently if we use sync_state, by default the bandwidth is maxed out,
but in order to set this in hardware, the BCMs (Bus Clock Managers) need
to be initialized first. Move the BCM initialization before creating the
nodes to fix this.
