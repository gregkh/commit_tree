media: staging: rkisp1: params: use the new effect value in cproc config

The cproc (color processing) configuration needs to know if
an image effect is configured. The code uses the image effect
in 'cur_params' which is the first params buffer queued in the stream.
This is the wrong place to read the value. The value should be
taken from the current params buffer.
