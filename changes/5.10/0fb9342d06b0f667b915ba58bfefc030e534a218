tty: serial: earlycon dependency

parse_options() in drivers/tty/serial/earlycon.c calls uart_parse_earlycon
in drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c therefore selecting SERIAL_EARLYCON
should automatically select SERIAL_CORE, otherwise will result in symbol
not found error during linking if SERIAL_CORE is not configured as builtin
