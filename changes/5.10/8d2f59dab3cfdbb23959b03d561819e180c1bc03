dmaengine: dw: Ignore burst setting for memory peripherals

According to the DW DMA controller Databook 2.18b (page 40 "3.5 Memory
Peripherals") memory peripherals don't have handshaking interface
connected to the controller, therefore they can never be a flow
controller. Since the CTLx.SRC_MSIZE and CTLx.DEST_MSIZE are properties
valid only for peripherals with a handshaking interface, we can freely
zero these fields out if the memory peripheral is selected to be the
source or the destination of the DMA transfers.

Note according to the databook, length of burst transfers to memory is
always equal to the number of data items available in a channel FIFO or
data items required to complete the block transfer, whichever is smaller;
length of burst transfers from memory is always equal to the space
available in a channel FIFO or number of data items required to complete
the block transfer, whichever is smaller.
