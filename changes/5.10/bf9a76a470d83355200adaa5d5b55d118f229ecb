arch/um: partially revert the conversion to __section() macro

A couple of um files ended up not including the header file that defines
the __section() macro, and the simplest fix is to just revert the change
for those files.

Fixes: 33def8498fdd treewide: Convert macro and uses of __section(foo) to __section("foo")
