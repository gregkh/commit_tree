blk-mq: remove the calling of local_memory_node()

We don't need to check whether the node is memoryless numa node before
calling allocator interface. SLUB(and SLAB,SLOB) relies on the page
allocator to pick a node. Page allocator should deal with memoryless
nodes just fine. It has zonelists constructed for each possible nodes.
And it will automatically fall back into a node which is closest to the
requested node. As long as __GFP_THISNODE is not enforced of course.

The code comments of kmem_cache_alloc_node() of SLAB also showed this:
 * Fallback to other node is possible if __GFP_THISNODE is not set.

blk-mq code doesn't set __GFP_THISNODE, so we can remove the calling
of local_memory_node().
