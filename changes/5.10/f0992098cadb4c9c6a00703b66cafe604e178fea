speakup: Reject setting the speakup line discipline outside of speakup

Speakup exposing a line discipline allows userland to try to use it,
while it is deemed to be useless, and thus uselessly exposes potential
bugs. One of them is simply that in such a case if the line sends data,
spk_ttyio_receive_buf2 is called and crashes since spk_ttyio_synth
is NULL.

This change restricts the use of the speakup line discipline to
speakup drivers, thus avoiding such kind of issues altogether.
