video: fbdev: vga16fb: fix setting of pixclock because a pass-by-value error

The pixclock is being set locally because it is being passed as a
pass-by-value argument rather than pass-by-reference, so the computed
pixclock is never being set in var->pixclock. Fix this by passing
by reference.

[This dates back to 2002, I found the offending commit from the git
history git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git ]
