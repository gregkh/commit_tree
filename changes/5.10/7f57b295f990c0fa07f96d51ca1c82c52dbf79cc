gpio: zynq: fix reference leak in zynq_gpio functions

pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even it
failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a
reference leak here.

A new function pm_runtime_resume_and_get is introduced in
[0] to keep usage counter balanced. So We fix the reference
leak by replacing it with new funtion.
