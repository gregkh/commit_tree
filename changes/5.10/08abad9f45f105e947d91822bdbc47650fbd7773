soundwire: intel: refine runtime pm for SDW_INTEL_CLK_STOP_BUS_RESET

When all the links are suspended, the HDaudio controller may suspend
and the power rails to the SoundWire IP may be disabled, requiring a
complete re-initialization/enumeration on resume. However, if one or
more Masters remained active, the HDaudio controller will remain active
and the power rails will remain enabled. As a result, during the link
resume step we can check if the context was preserved by verifying if
the clock was stopped, and avoid doing a complete bus reset and
re-enumeration.
