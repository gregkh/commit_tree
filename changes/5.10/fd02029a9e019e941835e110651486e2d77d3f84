KVM: selftests: Add aarch64 get-reg-list test

Check for KVM_GET_REG_LIST regressions. The blessed list was
created by running on v4.15 with the --core-reg-fixup option.
The following script was also used in order to annotate system
registers with their names when possible. When new system
registers are added the names can just be added manually using
the same grep.

while read reg; do
	if [[ ! $reg =~ ARM64_SYS_REG ]]; then
		printf "\t$reg\n"
		continue
	fi
	encoding=$(echo "$reg" | sed "s/ARM64_SYS_REG(//;s/),//")
	if ! name=$(grep "$encoding" ../../../../arch/arm64/include/asm/sysreg.h); then
		printf "\t$reg\n"
		continue
	fi
	name=$(echo "$name" | sed "s/.*SYS_//;s/[\t ]*sys_reg($encoding)$//")
	printf "\t$reg\t/* $name */\n"
done < <(aarch64/get-reg-list --core-reg-fixup --list)
