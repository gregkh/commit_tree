scftorture: Add cond_resched() to test loop

Although the test loop does randomly delay, which would provide quiescent
states and so forth, it is possible for there to be a series of long
smp_call_function*() handler runtimes with no delays, which results in
softlockup and RCU CPU stall warning messages.  This commit therefore
inserts a cond_resched() into the main test loop.
