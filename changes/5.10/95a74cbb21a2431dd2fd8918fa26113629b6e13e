rtc: ds1307: store previous charge default per chip

Some RTC's batteries and supercaps were charged by default until now.
In contrast other RTCs allow charging but the driver did not configure
them to do so until now. These must not be charged by default to stay
backwards compatible.

In order to do that, store the charge default per chip.
