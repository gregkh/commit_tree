devlink: don't crash if netdev is NULL

Following change will add support for a corner case where
we may not have a netdev to pass to devlink_port_type_eth_set()
but we still want to set port type.

This is definitely a corner case, and drivers should not normally
pass NULL netdev - print a warning message when this happens.

Sadly for other port types (ib) switches don't have a device
reference, the way we always do for Ethernet, so we can't put
the warning in __devlink_port_type_set().
