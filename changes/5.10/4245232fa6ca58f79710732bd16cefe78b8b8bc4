media: uapi: h264: Increase size of 'first_mb_in_slice' field

Slice header syntax element 'first_mb_in_slice' can point
to the last macroblock, currently the field can only reference
65536 macroblocks which is insufficient for 8K videos.

Although unlikely, a 8192x4320 video (where macroblocks are 16x16),
would contain 138240 macroblocks on a frame.

As per the H264 specification, 'first_mb_in_slice' can be up to
PicSizeInMbs - 1, so increase the size of the field to 32-bits.

Note that v4l2_ctrl_h264_slice_params struct will be modified
in a follow-up commit, and so we defer its 64-bit padding.
