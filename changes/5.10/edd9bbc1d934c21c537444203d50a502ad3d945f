Drivers: hv: vmbus: Move __vmbus_open()

Pure function movement, no functional changes. The move is made, because
in a later change, __vmbus_open() will rely on some static functions
afterwards, so we separate the move and the modification of
__vmbus_open() in two patches to make it easy to review.
