lockdep: Fix nr_unused_locks accounting

Chris reported that commit 24d5a3bffef1 ("lockdep: Fix
usage_traceoverflow") breaks the nr_unused_locks validation code
triggered by /proc/lockdep_stats.

By fully splitting LOCK_USED and LOCK_USED_READ it becomes a bad
indicator for accounting nr_unused_locks; simplyfy by using any first
bit.
