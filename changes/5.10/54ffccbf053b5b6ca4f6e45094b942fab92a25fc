tty: Fix ->pgrp locking in tiocspgrp()

tiocspgrp() takes two tty_struct pointers: One to the tty that userspace
passed to ioctl() (`tty`) and one to the TTY being changed (`real_tty`).
These pointers are different when ioctl() is called with a master fd.

To properly lock real_tty->pgrp, we must take real_tty->ctrl_lock.

This bug makes it possible for racing ioctl(TIOCSPGRP, ...) calls on
both sides of a PTY pair to corrupt the refcount of `struct pid`,
leading to use-after-free errors.
