cxgb4: Fix build failure when CONFIG_TLS=m

After commit 9d2e5e9eeb59 ("cxgb4/ch_ktls: decrypted bit is not enough")
whenever CONFIG_TLS=m and CONFIG_CHELSIO_T4=y, the following build
failure occurs:

ld: drivers/net/ethernet/chelsio/cxgb4/cxgb4_main.o: in function
`cxgb_select_queue':
cxgb4_main.c:(.text+0x2dac): undefined reference to `tls_validate_xmit_skb'

Fix this by ensuring that if TLS is set to be a module, CHELSIO_T4 will
also be compiled as a module. As otherwise the cxgb4 driver will not be
able to access TLS' symbols.
