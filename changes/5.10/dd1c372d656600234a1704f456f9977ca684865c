block: invoke blk_mq_exit_sched no matter whether have .exit_sched

We will register debugfs for scheduler no matter whether it have
defined callback funciton .exit_sched. So, blk_mq_exit_sched()
is always needed to unregister debugfs. Also, q->elevator should
be set as NULL after exiting scheduler.

For now, since all register scheduler have defined .exit_sched,
it will not cause any actual problem. But It will be more reasonable
to do this change.
