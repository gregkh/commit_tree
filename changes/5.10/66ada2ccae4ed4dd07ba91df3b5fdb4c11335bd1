kprobes: Add generic kretprobe trampoline handler

Add a generic kretprobe trampoline handler for unifying
the all cloned /arch/* kretprobe trampoline handlers.

The generic kretprobe trampoline handler is based on the
x86 implementation, because it is the latest implementation.
It has frame pointer checking, kprobe_busy_begin/end and
return address fixup for user handlers.
