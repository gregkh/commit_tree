tcp: Add saw_unknown to struct tcp_options_received

In a later patch, the bpf prog only wants to be called to handle
a header option if that particular header option cannot be handled by
the kernel.  This unknown option could be written by the peer's bpf-prog.
It could also be a new standard option that the running kernel does not
support it while a bpf-prog can handle it.

This patch adds a "saw_unknown" bit to "struct tcp_options_received"
and it uses an existing one byte hole to do that.  "saw_unknown" will
be set in tcp_parse_options() if it sees an option that the kernel
cannot handle.
