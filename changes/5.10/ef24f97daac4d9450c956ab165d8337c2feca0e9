mtd: rawnand: Separate the ECC engine type and the ECC byte placement

The use of "syndrome" placement should not be encoded in the ECC
engine mode/type.

Create a "placement" field in NAND chip and change all occurrences of
the NAND_ECC_HW_SYNDROME enumeration to be just NAND_ECC_HW and
possibly a placement entry like NAND_ECC_PLACEMENT_INTERLEAVED.
