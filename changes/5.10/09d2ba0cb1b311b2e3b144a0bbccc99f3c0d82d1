SUNRPC: Update debugging instrumentation in xprt_do_reserve()

Replace a dprintk() with a tracepoint. The tracepoint marks the
point where an RPC request is assigned an XID.

Additional clean up: Remove trace_xprt_enq_xmit, which reports much
the same thing. That tracepoint was added for debugging commit
918f3c1fe83c ("SUNRPC: Improve latency for interactive tasks").
