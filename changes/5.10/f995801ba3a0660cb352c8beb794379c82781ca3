x86/resctrl: Use container_of() in delayed_work handlers

mbm_handle_overflow() and cqm_handle_limbo() are both provided with
the domain's work_struct when called, but use get_domain_from_cpu()
to find the domain, along with the appropriate error handling.

container_of() saves some list walking and bitmap testing, use that
instead.
