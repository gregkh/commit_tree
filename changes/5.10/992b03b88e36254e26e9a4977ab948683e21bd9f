batman-adv: Don't always reallocate the fragmentation skb head

When a packet is fragmented by batman-adv, the original batman-adv header
is not modified. Only a new fragmentation is inserted between the original
one and the ethernet header. The code must therefore make sure that it has
a writable region of this size in the skbuff head.

But it is not useful to always reallocate the skbuff by this size even when
there would be more than enough headroom still in the skb. The reallocation
is just to costly during in this codepath.
