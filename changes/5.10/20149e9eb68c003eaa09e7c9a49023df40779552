ip_tunnel: fix over-mtu packet send fail without TUNNEL_DONT_FRAGMENT flags

The tunnel device such as vxlan, bareudp and geneve in the lwt mode set
the outer df only based TUNNEL_DONT_FRAGMENT.
And this was also the behavior for gre device before switching to use
ip_md_tunnel_xmit in commit 962924fa2b7a ("ip_gre: Refactor collect
metatdata mode tunnel xmit to ip_md_tunnel_xmit")

When the ip_gre in lwt mode xmit with ip_md_tunnel_xmi changed the rule and
make the discrepancy between handling of DF by different tunnels. So in the
ip_md_tunnel_xmit should follow the same rule like other tunnels.
