kvm: x86/mmu: Support disabling dirty logging for the tdp MMU

Dirty logging ultimately breaks down MMU mappings to 4k granularity.
When dirty logging is no longer needed, these granaular mappings
represent a useless performance penalty. When dirty logging is disabled,
search the paging structure for mappings that could be re-constituted
into a large page mapping. Zap those mappings so that they can be
faulted in again at a higher mapping level.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.
