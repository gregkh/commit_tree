smccc: Use separate variables for args and results

Using the same register-bound variable for both arguments and results
means these values share a type. That type must allow the arguments to
be assigned to it and must also be assignable to the unsigned long
fields of struct arm_smccc_res.

This restriction on types causes compiler warnings when the argument
cannot be implicitly assigned to an unsigned long, for example the
pointers that are used in the KVM hyp interface.

By separating the arguments and results into their own variables, the
type constraint is lifted allowing the arguments to avoid the need for
any type conversion.
