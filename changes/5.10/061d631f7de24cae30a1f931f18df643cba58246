dpaa2-eth: add support for devlink parser error drop traps

Add support for the new group of devlink traps - PARSER_ERROR_DROPS.
This consists of registering the array of parser error drops supported,
controlling their action through the .trap_group_action_set() callback
and reporting an erroneous skb received on the error queue
appropriately.
DPAA2 devices do not support controlling the action of independent
parser error traps, thus the .trap_action_set() callback just returns an
EOPNOTSUPP while .trap_group_action_set() actually notifies the hardware
what it should do with a frame marked as having a header error.
