ALSA: hda - Don't register a cb func if it is registered already

If the caller of enable_callback_mst() passes a cb func, the callee
function will malloc memory and link this cb func to the list
unconditionally. This will introduce problem if caller is in the
hda_codec_ops.init() since the init() will be repeatedly called in the
codec rt_resume().

So far, the patch_hdmi.c and patch_ca0132.c call enable_callback_mst()
in the hda_codec_ops.init().
