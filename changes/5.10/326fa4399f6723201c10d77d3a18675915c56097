dt-bindings: mfd: lp87565: Convert to yaml

Also apply a few smaller improvements:

 - document that the only possible I2C slave address is 0x60 as per the
   datasheet and fix the second example accordingly
 - The definition of "xxx-in-supply" was generic, thus define in detail the
   possible cases for each chip variant
 - remove "MFD driver" from the title as it is implementation specific
 - replace "PMIC" with "buck converter" in title as it is more informative
