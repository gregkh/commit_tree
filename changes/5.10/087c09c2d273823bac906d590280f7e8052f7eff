regulator: dummy: Constify dummy_initdata and dummy_ops

The only usage of dummy_initdata is to assign its address to the
init_data field of the regulator_config struct and the only usage
dummy_ops is to assign its address to the ops field in the
regulator_desc struct, both which are const pointers. Make them const to
allow the compiler to put them in read-only memory.
