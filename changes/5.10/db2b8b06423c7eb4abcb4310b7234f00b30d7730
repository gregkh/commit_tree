libbpf: Support CO-RE relocations for multi-prog sections

Fix up CO-RE relocation code to handle relocations against ELF sections
containing multiple BPF programs. This requires lookup of a BPF program by its
section name and instruction index it contains. While it could have been done
as a simple loop, it could run into performance issues pretty quickly, as
number of CO-RE relocations can be quite large in real-world applications, and
each CO-RE relocation incurs BPF program look up now. So instead of simple
loop, implement a binary search by section name + insn offset.
