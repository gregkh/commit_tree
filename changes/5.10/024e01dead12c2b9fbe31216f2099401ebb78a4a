media: pulse8-cec: fix duplicate free at disconnect or probe error

Commit 601282d65b96 ("media: pulse8-cec: use adap_free callback") used
the adap_free callback to clean up on disconnect. What I forgot was that
in the probe it will call cec_delete_adapter() followed by kfree(pulse8)
if an error occurs. But by using the adap_free callback,
cec_delete_adapter() is already freeing the pulse8 struct.

This wasn't noticed since normally the probe works fine, but Pulse-Eight
published a new firmware version that caused a probe error, so now it
hits this bug. This affects firmware version 12, but probably any
version >= 10.

Commit aa9eda76129c ("media: pulse8-cec: close serio in disconnect, not
adap_free") made this worse by adding the line 'pulse8->serio = NULL'
right after the call to cec_unregister_adapter in the disconnect()
function. Unfortunately, cec_unregister_adapter will typically call
cec_delete_adapter (unless a filehandle to the cec device is still
open), which frees the pulse8 struct. So now it will also crash on a
simple unplug of the Pulse-Eight device.

With this fix both the unplug issue and a probe() error situation are
handled correctly again.

It will still fail to probe() with a v12 firmware, that's something
to look at separately.
