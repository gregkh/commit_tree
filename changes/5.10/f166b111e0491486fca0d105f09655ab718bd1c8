rseq/selftests: Test MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ

Based on Google-internal RSEQ work done by Paul Turner and Andrew
Hunter.

This patch adds a selftest for MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ.
The test quite often fails without the previous patch in this
patchset, but consistently passes with it.
