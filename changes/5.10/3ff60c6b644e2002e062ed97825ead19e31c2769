spi: dw: Add DW SPI controller config structure

DW APB SSI controller can be used by the two SPI core interfaces:
traditional SPI transfers and SPI memory operations. The controller needs
to be accordingly configured at runtime when the corresponding operations
are executed. In order to do that for the both interfaces from a single
function we introduce a new data wrapper for the transfer mode, data
width, number of data frames (for the automatic data transfer) and the bus
frequency. It will be used by the update_config() method to tune the DW
APB SSI up.

The update_config() method is made exported to be used not only by the DW
SPI core driver, but by the glue layer drivers too. This will be required
in a coming further commit.
