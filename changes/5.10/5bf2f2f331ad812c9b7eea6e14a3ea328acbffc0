HID: ite: Add USB id match for Acer One S1003 keyboard dock

The Acer One S1003 2-in-1 keyboard dock uses a Synaptics S910xx touchpad
which is connected to an ITE 8910 USB keyboard controller chip.

This keyboard has the same quirk for its rfkill / airplane mode hotkey as
other keyboards with ITE keyboard chips, it only sends a single release
event when pressed and released, it never sends a press event.

This commit adds this keyboards USB id to the hid-ite id-table, fixing
the rfkill key not working on this keyboard. Note that like for the
Acer Aspire Switch 10 (SW5-012) the id-table entry matches on the
HID_GROUP_GENERIC generic group so that hid-ite only binds to the
keyboard interface and the mouse/touchpad interface is left untouched
so that hid-multitouch can bind to it.
