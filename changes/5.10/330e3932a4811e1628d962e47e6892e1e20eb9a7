PM: domains: Fix build error for genpd notifiers

The __raw_notifier_call_chain() was recently removed and replaced with
raw_notifier_call_chain_robust(). Recent changes to genpd didn't take that
into account, which causes a build error. Let's fix this by converting to
the raw_notifier_call_chain_robust() in genpd.
