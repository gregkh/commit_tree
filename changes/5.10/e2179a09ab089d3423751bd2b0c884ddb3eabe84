efi/libstub: Disable -mbranch-protection

In preparation for adding --orphan-handling=warn to more architectures,
disable -mbranch-protection, as EFI does not yet support it[1].  This was
noticed due to it producing unwanted .note.gnu.property sections (prefixed
with .init due to the objcopy build step).

However, we must also work around a bug in Clang where the section is
still emitted for code-less object files[2], so also remove the section
during the objcopy.
