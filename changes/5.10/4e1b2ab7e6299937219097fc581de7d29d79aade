KVM: PPC: Don't return -ENOTSUPP to userspace in ioctls

ENOTSUPP is a linux only thingy, the value of which is unknown to
userspace, not to be confused with ENOTSUP which linux maps to
EOPNOTSUPP, as permitted by POSIX [1]:

[EOPNOTSUPP]
Operation not supported on socket. The type of socket (address family
or protocol) does not support the requested operation. A conforming
implementation may assign the same values for [EOPNOTSUPP] and [ENOTSUP].

Return -EOPNOTSUPP instead of -ENOTSUPP for the following ioctls:
- KVM_GET_FPU for Book3s and BookE
- KVM_SET_FPU for Book3s and BookE
- KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG for BookE

This doesn't affect QEMU which doesn't call the KVM_GET_FPU and
KVM_SET_FPU ioctls on POWER anyway since they are not supported,
and _buggily_ ignores anything but -EPERM for KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG.
