bus: mhi: Remove include of rwlock_types.h

rwlock.h should not be included directly. Instead linux/splinlock.h
should be included. Including it directly will break the RT build.

Also there is no point in including _types.h headers directly. There is
no benefit in including the type without the accessor.
