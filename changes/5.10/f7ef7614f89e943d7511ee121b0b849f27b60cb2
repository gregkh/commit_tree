sound: line6: move to use usb_control_msg_send() and usb_control_msg_recv()

The usb_control_msg_send() and usb_control_msg_recv() calls can return
an error if a "short" write/read happens, and they can handle data off
of the stack, so move the driver over to using those calls instead,
saving some logic when dynamically allocating memory.
