iio: light: fix kconfig dependency bug for VCNL4035

When VCNL4035 is enabled and IIO_BUFFER is disabled, it results in the
following Kbuild warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
  Depends on [n]: IIO [=y] && IIO_BUFFER [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - VCNL4035 [=y] && IIO [=y] && I2C [=y]

The reason is that VCNL4035 selects IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER without depending
on or selecting IIO_BUFFER while IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER depends on
IIO_BUFFER. This can also fail building the kernel.

Honor the kconfig dependency to remove unmet direct dependency warnings
and avoid any potential build failures.
