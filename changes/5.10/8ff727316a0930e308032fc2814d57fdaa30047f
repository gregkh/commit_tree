i2c: tegra: Remove i2c_dev.clk_divisor_non_hs_mode member

The "non_hs_mode" divisor value is fixed, thus there is no need to have
the variable i2c_dev.clk_divisor_non_hs_mode struct member. Let's remove
it and move the mode selection into tegra_i2c_init() where it can be
united with the timing selection.
