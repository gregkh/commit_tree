spi: lpspi: Fix use-after-free on unbind

Normally the last reference on an spi_controller is released by
spi_unregister_controller().  In the case of the i.MX lpspi driver,
the spi_controller is registered with devm_spi_register_controller(),
so spi_unregister_controller() is invoked automatically after the driver
has unbound.

However the driver already releases the last reference in
fsl_lpspi_remove() through a gratuitous call to spi_master_put(),
causing a use-after-free when spi_unregister_controller() is
subsequently invoked by the devres framework.

Fix by dropping the superfluous spi_master_put().
