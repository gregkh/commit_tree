habanalabs: release kernel context after hw_fini

Some engines use resources that belong to the kernel context (e.g. MMU
mappings). In case the halt-engines doesn't work properly due to H/W
restriction, we need to make sure the kernel context lives on until after
the hw_fini. The hw_fini resets the ASIC after that no engine is alive and
we can safely close the kernel context.
