btrfs: introduce BTRFS_NESTING_COW for cow'ing blocks

When we COW a block we are holding a lock on the original block, and
then we lock the new COW block.  Because our lockdep maps are based on
root + level, this will make lockdep complain.  We need a way to
indicate a subclass for locking the COW'ed block, so plumb through our
btrfs_lock_nesting from btrfs_cow_block down to the btrfs_init_buffer,
and then introduce BTRFS_NESTING_COW to be used for cow'ing blocks.

The reason I've added all this extra infrastructure is because there
will be need of different nesting classes in follow up patches.
