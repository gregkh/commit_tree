drm/xlnx: Use devm_drm_dev_alloc

Gets rid of drmm_add_final_kfree, which I want to unexport so that it
stops confusion people about this transitional state of rolling drm
managed memory out.

This also fixes the missing drm_dev_put in the error path of the probe
code.

v2: Drop the misplaced drm_dev_put from zynqmp_dpsub_drm_init (all
other paths leaked on error, this should have been in
zynqmp_dpsub_probe), now that subsumed by the auto-cleanup of
devm_drm_dev_alloc.
