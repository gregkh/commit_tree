torture: Add gdb support

This commit adds a "--gdb" parameter to kvm.sh, which causes
"CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y" to be added to the Kconfig options, "nokaslr"
to be added to the boot parameters, and "-s -S" to be added to the qemu
arguments.  Furthermore, the scripting prints messages telling the user
how to start up gdb for the run in question.

Because of the interactive nature of gdb sessions, only one "--configs"
scenario is permitted when "--gdb" is specified.  For most torture types,
this means that a "--configs" argument is required, and that argument
must specify the single scenario of interest.

The usual cautions about breakpoints and timing apply, for example,
staring at your gdb prompt for too long will likely get you many
complaints, including RCU CPU stall warnings.  Omar Sandoval further
suggests using gdb's "hbreak" command instead of the "break" command on
systems supporting hardware breakpoints, and further using the "commands"
option because the resulting non-interactive breakpoints are less likely
to get you RCU CPU stall warnings.
