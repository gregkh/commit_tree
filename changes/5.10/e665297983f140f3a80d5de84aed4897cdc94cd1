net: dsa: tag_sja1105: use a custom flow dissector procedure

The sja1105 is a bit of a special snowflake, in that not all frames are
transmitted/received in the same way. L2 link-local frames are received
with the source port/switch ID information put in the destination MAC
address. For the rest, a tag_8021q header is used. So only the latter
frames displace the rest of the headers and need to use the generic flow
dissector procedure.
