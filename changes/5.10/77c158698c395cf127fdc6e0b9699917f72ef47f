perf c2c: Correct LLC load hit metrics

"rmt_hit" is accounted into two metrics: one is accounted into the
metrics "LLC Ld Miss" (see the function llc_miss() for calculation
"llcmiss"); and it's accounted into metrics "LLC Load Hit".  Thus,
for the literal meaning, it is contradictory that "rmt_hit" is
accounted for both "LLC Ld Miss" (LLC miss) and "LLC Load Hit"
(LLC hit).

Thus this is easily to introduce confusion: "LLC Load Hit" gives
impression that all items belong to it are LLC hit; in fact "rmt_hit"
is LLC miss and remote cache hit.

To give out clear semantics for metric "LLC Load Hit", "rmt_hit" is
moved out from it and changes "LLC Load Hit" to contain two items:

  LLC Load Hit = LLC's hit ("ld_llchit") + LLC's hitm ("lcl_hitm")

For output alignment, adjusts the header for "LLC Load Hit".
