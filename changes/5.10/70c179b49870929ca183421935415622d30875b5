cpuidle: psci: Allow PM domain to be initialized even if no OSI mode

If the PSCI OSI mode isn't supported or fails to be enabled, the PM domain
topology with the genpd providers isn't initialized. This is perfectly fine
from cpuidle-psci point of view.

However, since the PM domain topology in the DTS files is a description of
the HW, no matter of whether the PSCI OSI mode is supported or not, other
consumers besides the CPUs may rely on it.

Therefore, let's always allow the initialization of the PM domain topology
to succeed, independently of whether the PSCI OSI mode is supported.
Consequentially we need to track if we succeed to enable the OSI mode, as
to know when a domain idlestate can be selected.

Note that, CPU devices are still not being attached to the PM domain
topology, unless the PSCI OSI mode is supported.
