mac80211: minstrel: fix tx status processing corner case

Some drivers fill the status rate list without setting the rate index after
the final rate to -1. minstrel_ht already deals with this, but minstrel
doesn't, which causes it to get stuck at the lowest rate on these drivers.

Fix this by checking the count as well.
