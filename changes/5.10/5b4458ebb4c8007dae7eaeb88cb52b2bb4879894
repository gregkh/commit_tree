ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Ensure a minimum delay before clock stabilization

As indicated in the datasheet, a 10ms delay must be observed after
programming the divisors.

The lack of delay prevents the codec to work properly and the playback
appears extremely slow and totally un-audible on a custom sama5 based
board.
