wcn36xx: Extend HAL param config list

In order to get 802.11ac working the way we want, additional parameters
need to be passed down to the firmware.

This patch takes the full remaining set of parameters defined in the
downstream riva/inc/wlan_hal_cfg.h and imports them into hal.h with some
minor name length adjustments.

This addition will allow us to pass a larger firmware configuration set
later on.
