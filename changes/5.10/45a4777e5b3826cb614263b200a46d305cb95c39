crypto: arm/aes-neonbs - avoid hacks to prevent Thumb2 mode switches

Instead of using a homegrown macrofied version of the adr instruction
that sets the Thumb bit in the output value, only to ensure that any
bx instructions consuming that value will not switch out of Thumb mode
when branching, use non-interworking mov (to PC) instructions, which
achieve the same thing.
