xfs: revert "xfs: fix rmap key and record comparison functions"

This reverts commit 6ff646b2ceb0eec916101877f38da0b73e3a5b7f.

Your maintainer committed a major braino in the rmap code by adding the
attr fork, bmbt, and unwritten extent usage bits into rmap record key
comparisons.  While XFS uses the usage bits *in the rmap records* for
cross-referencing metadata in xfs_scrub and xfs_repair, it only needs
the owner and offset information to distinguish between reverse mappings
of the same physical extent into the data fork of a file at multiple
offsets.  The other bits are not important for key comparisons for index
lookups, and never have been.

Eric Sandeen reports that this causes regressions in generic/299, so
undo this patch before it does more damage.
