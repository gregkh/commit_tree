Revert "mei: virtio: virtualization frontend driver"

This reverts commit d162219c655c8cf8003128a13840d6c1e183fb80.

The device uses a VIRTIO device ID out of a not-for-production range.
Releasing Linux using an ID out of this range will make it conflict with
development setups. An official request to reserve an ID for an MEI
device is yet to be submitted to the virtio TC, thus there's no chance
it will be reserved and fixed in time before the next release.

Once requested it usually takes 2-3 weeks to land in the spec, which
means the device can be supported with the official ID in the next Linux
version if contributors act quickly.
