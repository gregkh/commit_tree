can: mcp251x: add support for half duplex controllers

Some SPI host controllers do not support full-duplex SPI and are
marked as such via the SPI_CONTROLLER_HALF_DUPLEX controller flag.

For such controllers use half duplex transactions but retain full
duplex transactions for the controllers that can handle those.
