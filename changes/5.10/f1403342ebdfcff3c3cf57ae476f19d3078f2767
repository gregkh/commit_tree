drm/amdgpu: revert "fix system hang issue during GPU reset"

The whole approach wasn't thought through till the end.

We already had a reset lock like this in the past and it caused the same problems like this one.

Completely revert the patch for now and add individual trylock protection to the hardware access functions as necessary.

This reverts commit df9c8d1aa278c435c30a69b8f2418b4a52fcb929.
