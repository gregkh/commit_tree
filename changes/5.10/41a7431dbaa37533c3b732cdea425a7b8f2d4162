power: supply: bq27xxx: add support for TI bq34z100

Add support for new device: the TI bq34z100-G1, a Wide Range Fuel Gauge
for Li-Ion, PbA, NiMH, and NiCd batteries.  The device shares a lot with
other models, although it has its own differences requiring new quirks.

This patch was tested on a system equipped with NiMH batteries.
