btrfs: switch seed device to list api

While this patch touches a bunch of files the conversion is
straighforward. Instead of using the implicit linked list anchored at
btrfs_fs_devices::seed the code is switched to using
list_for_each_entry.

Previous patches in the series already factored out code that processed
both main and seed devices so in those cases the factored out functions
are called on the main fs_devices and then on every seed dev inside
list_for_each_entry.

Using list api also allows to simplify deletion from the seed dev list
performed in btrfs_rm_device and btrfs_rm_dev_replace_free_srcdev by
substituting a while() loop with a simple list_del_init.
