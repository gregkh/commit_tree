fs/kernel_read_file: Remove FIRMWARE_EFI_EMBEDDED enum

The "FIRMWARE_EFI_EMBEDDED" enum is a "where", not a "what". It
should not be distinguished separately from just "FIRMWARE", as this
confuses the LSMs about what is being loaded. Additionally, there was
no actual validation of the firmware contents happening.

Fixes: e4c2c0ff00ec ("firmware: Add new platform fallback mechanism and firmware_request_platform()")
