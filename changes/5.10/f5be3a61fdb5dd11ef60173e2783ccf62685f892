arm64: perf: Add support caps under sysfs

ARMv8.4-PMU introduces the PMMIR_EL1 registers and some new PMU events,
like STALL_SLOT etc, are related to it. Let's add a caps directory to
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/armv8_pmuv3_0/ and support slots from
PMMIR_EL1 registers in this entry. The user programs can get the slots
from sysfs directly.

/sys/bus/event_source/devices/armv8_pmuv3_0/caps/slots is exposed
under sysfs. Both ARMv8.4-PMU and STALL_SLOT event are implemented,
it returns the slots from PMMIR_EL1, otherwise it will return 0.
