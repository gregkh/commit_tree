x86/sev-es: Setup GHCB-based boot #VC handler

Add the infrastructure to handle #VC exceptions when the kernel runs on
virtual addresses and has mapped a GHCB. This handler will be used until
the runtime #VC handler takes over.

Since the handler runs very early, disable instrumentation for sev-es.c.

 [ bp: Make vc_ghcb_invalidate() __always_inline so that it can be
   inlined in noinstr functions like __sev_es_nmi_complete(). ]
