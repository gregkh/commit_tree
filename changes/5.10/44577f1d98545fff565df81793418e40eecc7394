platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: do not create a static struct device

A struct device is a dynamic structure, with reference counting.
"Tricking" the kernel to make a dynamic structure static, by working
around the driver core release detection logic, is not nice.

Because of this, this code has been used as an example for others on
"how to do things", which is just about the worst thing possible to have
happen.

Fix this all up by making the platform device dynamic and providing a
real release function.
