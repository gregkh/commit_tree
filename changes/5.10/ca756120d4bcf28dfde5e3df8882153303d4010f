ASoC: Intel: Remove haswell solution

Newly added catpt solution found in sound/soc/intel/catpt is a direct
replacement to sound/soc/intel/haswell. It covers all features supported
by it and more - by aligning to recommended flows and requirement list
based on Windows driver equivalent. No harm is done to userspace as
catpt - similarly to haswell - loads no extenal topology files while
sharing the exact same ADSP firmware binary.

Given the above, existing haswell code is redundant so remove it.
