habanalabs: allow to wait on CS without sleep

The user sometimes wants to check if a CS has completed to clean resources.
In that case, the user doesn't want to sleep but just to check if the CS
has finished and continue with his code.

Add a new definition to the API of the wait on CS. The new definition says
that if the timeout is 0, the driver won't sleep at all but return
immediately after checking if the CS has finished.
