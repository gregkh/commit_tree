iio: gyro: Add driver support for ADXRS290

ADXRS290 is a high performance MEMS pitch and roll (dual-axis in-plane)
angular rate sensor (gyroscope) designed for use in stabilization
applications. It also features an internal temperature sensor and
programmable high-pass and low-pass filters.

Add support for ADXRS290 in direct-access mode for now.
