Fix this by changing the chunk_sectors member of 'struct mddev' from
int to 'unsigned int' to match the type used for the 'chunk_sectors'
member of 'struct queue_limits'.  Various MD code still uses 'int' but
none of it appears to ever make use of signed int; and storing
positive signed int in unsigned is perfectly safe.
