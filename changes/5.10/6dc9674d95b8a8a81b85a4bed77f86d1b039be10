regulator: lochnagar: Add additional VDDCORE range

In the case of an unrecognised mini-card the Lochnagar will not
initialise the VDDCORE voltage register leading to a value outside of the
current range. Add an additional range to cover these values, initially
this wasn't done since they are duplicates of the existing minimum
value.
