dma-mapping: fix DMA_OPS dependencies

Driver that select DMA_OPS need to depend on HAS_DMA support to
work.  The vop driver was missing that dependency, so add it, and also
add a another depends in DMA_OPS itself.  That won't fix the issue due
to how the Kconfig dependencies work, but at least produce a warning
about unmet dependencies.
