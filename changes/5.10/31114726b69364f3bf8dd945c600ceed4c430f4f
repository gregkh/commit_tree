fscrypt: move fscrypt_prepare_symlink() out-of-line

In preparation for moving the logic for "get the encryption policy
inherited by new files in this directory" to a single place, make
fscrypt_prepare_symlink() a regular function rather than an inline
function that wraps __fscrypt_prepare_symlink().

This way, the new function fscrypt_policy_to_inherit() won't need to be
exported to filesystems.
