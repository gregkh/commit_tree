selftests/seccomp: Remove SYSCALL_NUM_RET_SHARE_REG in favor of SYSCALL_RET_SET

Instead of special-casing the specific case of shared registers, create
a default SYSCALL_RET_SET() macro (mirroring SYSCALL_NUM_SET()), that
writes to the SYSCALL_RET register. For architectures that can't set the
return value (for whatever reason), they can define SYSCALL_RET_SET()
without an associated SYSCALL_RET() macro. This also paves the way for
architectures that need to do special things to set the return value
(e.g. powerpc).
