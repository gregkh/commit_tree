include/linux/list.h: add a macro to test if entry is pointing to the head

Add a macro to test if entry is pointing to the head of the list which is
useful in cases like:

  list_for_each_entry(pos, &head, member) {
    if (cond)
      break;
  }
  if (list_entry_is_head(pos, &head, member))
    return -ERRNO;

that allows to avoid additional variable to be added to track if loop has
not been stopped in the middle.

While here, convert list_for_each_entry*() family of macros to use a new one.
