vdpa: handle irq bypass register failure case

LKP considered variable 'ret' in vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() as
a unused variable, so suggest we remove it. Actually it stores
return value of irq_bypass_register_producer(), but we did not
check it, we should handle the failure case.

This commit will print a message if irq bypass register producer
fail, in this case, vqs still remain functional.
