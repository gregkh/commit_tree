media: MAINTAINERS: Remove Kyungmin from the maintainers list of videobuf2

According to [1], there has been no email posted from him to the
linux-media mailing list since Feb 2013.

Note: The linked archive seems to lack messages newer than the middle of
2019, but it is the only archive that offers search by name. A manual
look through the messages after that time confirms the observation.
