bpf: selftest: Ensure the return value of the bpf_per_cpu_ptr() must be checked

This patch tests all pointers returned by bpf_per_cpu_ptr() must be
tested for NULL first before it can be accessed.

This patch adds a subtest "null_check", so it moves the ".data..percpu"
existence check to the very beginning and before doing any subtest.
