soundwire: fix port_ready[] dynamic allocation in mipi_disco

The existing code allocates memory for the total number of ports.
This only works if the ports are contiguous, but will break if e.g. a
Devices uses port0, 1, and 14. The port_ready[] array would contain 3
elements, which would lead to an out-of-bounds access. Conversely in
other cases, the wrong port index would be used leading to timeouts on
prepare.

This can be fixed by allocating for the worst-case of 15
ports (DP0..DP14). In addition since the number is now fixed, we can
use an array instead of a dynamic allocation.
