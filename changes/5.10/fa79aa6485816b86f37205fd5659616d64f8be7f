perf streams: Link stream pair

In previous patch, we have created an evsel_streams for one event, and
top N hottest streams will be saved in a stream array in evsel_streams.

This patch compares total streams among two evsel_streams.

Once two streams are fully matched, they will be linked as a pair. From
the pair, we can know which streams are matched.
