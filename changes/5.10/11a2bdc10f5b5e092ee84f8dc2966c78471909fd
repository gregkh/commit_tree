dt-bindings: power: supply: Extend max17040 compatibility

Maxim max17040 is a fuel gauge from a larger family utilising the Model
Gauge technology. Document all different compatible strings that the
max17040 driver recognizes.

Some devices in the wild report double the capacity. The
maxim,double-soc (from State-Of-Charge) property fixes that.
