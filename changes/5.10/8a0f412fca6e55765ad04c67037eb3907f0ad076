iio: adc: fsl-imx25-gcq: Replace indio_dev->mlock with own device lock

As part of the general cleanup of indio_dev->mlock, this change replaces
it with a local lock, to protect against any other accesses during the
reading of sample. Reading a sample requires multiple consecutive regmap
operations and a completion callback, so this requires that no other
read occurs until it completes.

This is part of a bigger cleanup.
