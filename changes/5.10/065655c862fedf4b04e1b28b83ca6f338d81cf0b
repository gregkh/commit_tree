blk-iocost: decouple vrate adjustment from surplus transfers

Budget donations are inaccurate and could take multiple periods to converge.
To prevent triggering vrate adjustments while surplus transfers were
catching up, vrate adjustment was suppressed if donations were increasing,
which was indicated by non-zero nr_surpluses.

This entangling won't be necessary with the scheduled rewrite of donation
mechanism which will make it precise and immediate. Let's decouple the two
in preparation.
