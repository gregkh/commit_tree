net/mlx5: Add support for devlink reload action fw activate

Add support for devlink reload action fw_activate. To activate firmware
image the mlx5 driver resets the firmware and reloads it from flash. If
a new image was stored on flash it will be loaded. Once this reload
command is executed the driver initiates fw sync reset flow, where the
firmware synchronizes all PFs on coming reset and driver reload.
