pinctrl: imx: Use function callbacks for SCU related functions

Use function callbacks for SCU related functions in pinctrl-imx.c
in order to support the scenario of PINCTRL_IMX is built in while
PINCTRL_IMX_SCU is built as module, all drivers using SCU pinctrl
driver need to initialize the SCU related function callback, and
no need to check CONFIG_PINCTRL_IMX_SCU anymore, hence stub functions
also can be removed.
