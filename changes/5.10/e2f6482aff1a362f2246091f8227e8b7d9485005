arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Use labels in board device trees

Device trees for newer SoCs avoid replicating the entire device
hierarchy in the board-specific device tree part. Instead,
they set additional properties only by referencing labels,
sorted alphabetically.

Now that we have labels for all relevant nodes, convert the MSM8916
board device trees to use the same style and remove the "soc" node
entirely.

Note: There is a large block of coresight nodes in apq8016-sbc.dtsi,
which are enabled by setting status = "okay". I kept them grouped
together (not alphabetically sorted with everything else),
since that would be just unnecessarily verbose and hard to see.

This commit only moves all existing properties to nodes that reference
the respective label. The resulting binary DTBs are exactly the same.
