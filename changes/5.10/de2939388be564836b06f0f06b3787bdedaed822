io_uring: improve registered buffer accounting for huge pages

io_uring does account any registered buffer as pinned/locked memory, and
checks limit and fails if the given user doesn't have a big enough limit
to register the ranges specified. However, if huge pages are used, we
are potentially under-accounting the memory in terms of what gets pinned
on the vm side.

This patch rectifies that, by ensuring that we account the full size of
a compound page, regardless of how much of it is being registered. Huge
pages are not accounted mulitple times - if multiple sections of a huge
page is registered, then the page is only accounted once.
