KVM: x86: handle !lapic_in_kernel case in kvm_cpu_*_extint

Centralize handling of interrupts from the userspace APIC
in kvm_cpu_has_extint and kvm_cpu_get_extint, since
userspace APIC interrupts are handled more or less the
same as ExtINTs are with split irqchip.  This removes
duplicated code from kvm_cpu_has_injectable_intr and
kvm_cpu_has_interrupt, and makes the code more similar
between kvm_cpu_has_{extint,interrupt} on one side
and kvm_cpu_get_{extint,interrupt} on the other.
