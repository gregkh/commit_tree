drm/i915: Add connector to hdcp_shim->check_link()

Currently we derive the connector from digital port in check_link(). For
MST, this isn't sufficient since the digital port passed into the
function can have multiple connectors downstream. This patch adds
connector to the check_link() arguments so we have it when we need it.
