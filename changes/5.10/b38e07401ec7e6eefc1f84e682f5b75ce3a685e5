xfs: drop the obsolete comment on filestream locking

Since commit 1c1c6ebcf52 ("xfs: Replace per-ag array with a radix
tree"), there is no m_peraglock anymore, so it's hard to understand
the described situation since per-ag is no longer an array and no
need to reallocate, call xfs_filestream_flush() in growfs.

In addition, the race condition for shrink feature is quite confusing
to me currently as well. Get rid of it instead.
