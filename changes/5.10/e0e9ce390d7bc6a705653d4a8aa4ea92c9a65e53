ACPI: EC: PM: Drop ec_no_wakeup check from acpi_ec_dispatch_gpe()

It turns out that in some cases there are EC events to flush in
acpi_ec_dispatch_gpe() even though the ec_no_wakeup kernel parameter
is set and the EC GPE is disabled while sleeping, so drop the
ec_no_wakeup check that prevents those events from being processed
from acpi_ec_dispatch_gpe().
