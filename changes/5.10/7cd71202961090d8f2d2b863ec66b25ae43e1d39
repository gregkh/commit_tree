spi: imx: fix the unbalanced spi runtime pm management

If set active without increase the usage count of pm, the dont use
autosuspend function will call the suspend callback to close the two
clocks of spi because the usage count is reduced to -1.
This will cause the warning dump below when the defer-probe occurs.

[  129.379701] ecspi2_root_clk already disabled
[  129.384005] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 33 at drivers/clk/clk.c:952 clk_core_disable+0xa4/0xb0

So add the get noresume function before set active.
