RDMA/efa: Remove redundant udata check from alloc ucontext response

The alloc ucontext flow is always called with a valid udata, there's no
need to test whether it's NULL.

While at it, the 'udata->outlen' check is removed as well as we copy the
minimum between the size of the response and outlen, so in case of zero
outlen, zero bytes will be copied.
