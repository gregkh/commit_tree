firmware: arm_sdei: Remove duplicate check in sdei_get_conduit()

The following two checks are duplicate because @acpi_disabled doesn't
depend on CONFIG_ACPI. So the duplicate check (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ACPI))
can be dropped. More details is provided to keep the commit log complete:

   * @acpi_disabled is defined in arch/arm64/kernel/acpi.c when
     CONFIG_ACPI is enabled.
   * @acpi_disabled in defined in include/acpi.h when CONFIG_ACPI
     is disabled.
