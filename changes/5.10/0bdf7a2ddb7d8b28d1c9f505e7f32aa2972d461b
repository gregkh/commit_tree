io_uring: use a separate struct for timeout_remove

Don't use struct io_timeout for both IORING_OP_TIMEOUT and
IORING_OP_TIMEOUT_REMOVE, they're quite different. Split them in two,
that allows to remove an unused field in struct io_timeout, and btw kill
->flags not used by either. This also easier to follow, especially for
timeout remove.
