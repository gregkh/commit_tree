perf/x86/intel: Support per-thread RDPMC TopDown metrics

Starts from Ice Lake, the TopDown metrics are directly available as
fixed counters and do not require generic counters. Also, the TopDown
metrics can be collected per thread. Extend the RDPMC usage to support
per-thread TopDown metrics.

The RDPMC index of the PERF_METRICS will be output if RDPMC users ask
for the RDPMC index of the metrics events.

To support per thread RDPMC TopDown, the metrics and slots counters have
to be saved/restored during the context switching.

The last_period and period_left are not used in the counting mode. Use
the fields for saved_metric and saved_slots.
