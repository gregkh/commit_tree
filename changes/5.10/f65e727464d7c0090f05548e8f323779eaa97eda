rtc: rtc-rs5c313: Fix late hardware init

rs5c313_rtc_init() calls platform_driver_register(), and initializes the
hardware.  This is wrong because of two reasons:
  1. As soon as the driver has been registered, the device may be
     probed.  If devm_rtc_device_register() is called before hardware
     initialization, reading the current time will fail:

	rs5c313 rs5c313: rs5c313_rtc_read_time: timeout error
	rs5c313 rs5c313: registered as rtc0
	rs5c313 rs5c313: rs5c313_rtc_read_time: timeout error
	rs5c313 rs5c313: hctosys: unable to read the hardware clock

  2. If the platform device does not exist, the driver will still write
     to a hardware device that may not be present.

Fix this by moving the hardware initialization sequence to the driver's
.probe() method.
