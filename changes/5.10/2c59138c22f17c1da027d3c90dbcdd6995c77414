opp: Set required OPPs in reverse order when scaling down

The OPP core already has well-defined semantics to ensure required
OPPs/regulators are set before/after the frequency change, depending
on if we scale up or down.

Similar requirements might exist for the order of required OPPs
when multiple power domains need to be scaled for a frequency change.

For example, on Qualcomm platforms using CPR (Core Power Reduction),
we need to scale the VDDMX and CPR power domain. When scaling up,
MX should be scaled up before CPR. When scaling down, CPR should be
scaled down before MX.

In general, if there are multiple "required-opps" in the device tree
I would expect that the order is either irrelevant, or there is some
dependency between the power domains. In that case, the power domains
should be scaled down in reverse order.

This commit updates _set_required_opps() to set required OPPs in
reverse order when scaling down.
