arm64: perf: Add missing ISB in armv8pmu_enable_counter()

Writes to the PMXEVTYPER_EL0 register are not self-synchronising. In
armv8pmu_enable_event(), the PE can reorder configuring the event type
after we have enabled the counter and the interrupt. This can lead to an
interrupt being asserted because of the previous event type that we were
counting using the same counter, not the one that we've just configured.

The same rationale applies to writes to the PMINTENSET_EL1 register. The PE
can reorder enabling the interrupt at any point in the future after we have
enabled the event.

Prevent both situations from happening by adding an ISB just before we
enable the event counter.
