ice: fix adding IP4 IP6 Flow Director rules

A subsequent addition of an IP4 or IP6 rule after other rules would
overwrite any existing TCAM entries of related L4 protocols(ex: tcp4 or
udp6). This was due to the mask including too many TCAM entries. Add new
packet type masks with bits properly excluded so rules are not overwritten.
