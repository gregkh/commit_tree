XArray: add xas_split

In order to use multi-index entries for huge pages in the page cache, we
need to be able to split a multi-index entry (eg if a file is truncated in
the middle of a huge page entry).  This version does not support splitting
more than one level of the tree at a time.  This is an acceptable
limitation for the page cache as we do not expect to support order-12
pages in the near future.
