ext4: fast commit recovery path

This patch adds fast commit recovery path support for Ext4 file
system. We add several helper functions that are similar in spirit to
e2fsprogs journal recovery path handlers. Example of such functions
include - a simple block allocator, idempotent block bitmap update
function etc. Using these routines and the fast commit log in the fast
commit area, the recovery path (ext4_fc_replay()) performs fast commit
log recovery.
