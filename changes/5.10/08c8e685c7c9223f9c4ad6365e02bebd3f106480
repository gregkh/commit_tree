s390: add ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_WX support

Checks the whole kernel address space for W+X mappings. Note that
currently the first lowcore page unfortunately has to be mapped
W+X. Therefore this not reported as an insecure mapping.

For the very same reason the wording is also different to other
architectures if the test passes:

On s390 it is "no unexpected W+X pages found" instead of
"no W+X pages found".
