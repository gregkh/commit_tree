eeprom: at24: Initialise AT24 NVMEM ID field

The AT24 EEPROM driver does not initialise the 'id' field of the
nvmem_config structure and because the entire structure is not
initialised, it ends up with a random value. This causes the NVMEM
driver to append the device 'devid' value to name of the NVMEM
device. Ideally for I2C devices such as the AT24 that already have a
unique name, we would not bother to append the 'devid'. However, given
that this has always been done for AT24 devices, we cannot remove the
'devid' as this will change the name of the userspace sysfs node for
the NVMEM device. Nonetheless we should ensure that the 'id' field of
the nvmem_config structure is initialised so that there is no chance of
a random value causes problems in the future. Therefore, set the NVMEM
config.id to NVMEM_DEVID_AUTO for AT24 EEPROMs so that the 'devid' is
always appended.
