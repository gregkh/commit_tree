power: supply: charger-manager: Make decisions focussed on battery status

cm_monitor(), where charging management starts, checks various charging
condition sequentially to decide next charging operation. However, as it
follows sequential process, cascaded if statements, it does some
jobs which have already done in the previous stage. This results in a
delay in decision making. Moreover, starting point of charging is spread
all around which makes maintain code and debugging difficult.

Both of the problems mentioned above become clean if it manages battery
charging focusing on battery status not following sequential condition
checking.  Now, cm_monitor() moves battery state diagram and does the
optimal operation for current state. As a result, it reduces whole
monitoring time almost in half.
