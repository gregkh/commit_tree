net: dsa: rtl8366rb: Roof MTU for switch

The MTU setting for this DSA switch is global so we need
to keep track of the MTU set for each port, then as soon
as any MTU changes, roof the MTU to the biggest common
denominator and poke that into the switch MTU setting.

To achieve this we need a per-chip-variant state container
for the RTL8366RB to use for the RTL8366RB-specific
stuff. Other SMI switches does seem to have per-port
MTU setting capabilities.
