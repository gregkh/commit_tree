mac80211: avoid processing non-S1G elements on S1G band

In ieee80211_determine_chantype(), the sband->ht_cap was
being processed before S1G Operation element.  Since the
HT capability element should not be present on the S1G
band, avoid processing potential garbage by moving the
call to ieee80211_apply_htcap_overrides() to after the S1G
block.

Also, in case of a missing S1G Operation element, we would
continue trying to process non-S1G elements (and return
with a channel width of 20MHz). Instead, just assume
primary channel is equal to operating and infer the
operating width from the BSS channel, then return.
