regmap: add Intel SPI Slave to AVMM Bus Bridge support

This patch add support for regmap APIs that are intended to be used by
the drivers of some SPI slave chips which integrate the "SPI slave to
Avalon Master Bridge" (spi-avmm) IP.

The spi-avmm IP acts as a bridge to convert encoded streams of bytes
from the host to the chip's internal register read/write on Avalon bus.
The driver implements the register read/write operations for a generic
SPI master to access the sub devices behind spi-avmm bridge.
