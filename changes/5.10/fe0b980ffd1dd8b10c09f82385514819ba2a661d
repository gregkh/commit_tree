iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: set 10ms as min shub slave timeout

Set 10ms as minimum i2c slave configuration timeout since st_lsm6dsx
relies on accel ODR for i2c master clock and at high sample rates
(e.g. 833Hz or 416Hz) the slave sensor occasionally may need more cycles
than i2c master timeout (2s/833Hz + 1 ~ 3ms) to apply the configuration
resulting in an uncomplete slave configuration and a constant reading
from the i2c slave connected to st_lsm6dsx i2c master.

Fixes: 8f9a5249e3d9 ("iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: enable 833Hz sample frequency for tagged sensors")
Fixes: c91c1c844ebd ("iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: add i2c embedded controller support")
