net/smc: send ISM devices with unique chid in CLC proposal

When building a CLC proposal message then the list of ISM devices does
not need to contain multiple devices that have the same chid value,
all these devices use the same function at the end.
Improve smc_find_ism_v2_device_clnt() to collect only ISM devices that
have unique chid values.
