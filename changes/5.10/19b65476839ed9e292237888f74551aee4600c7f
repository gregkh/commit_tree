usb: typec: tcpci: Add support when hidden tx registers are inaccessible

TCPCI spec forbids direct access of TX_BUF_BYTE_x register.
The existing version of tcpci driver assumes that those registers
are directly addressible. Add support for tcpci chips which do
not support direct access to TX_BUF_BYTE_x registers. TX_BUF_BYTE_x
can only be accessed by I2C_WRITE_BYTE_COUNT.
