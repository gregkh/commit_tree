sctp: Fix COMM_LOST/CANT_STR_ASSOC err reporting on big-endian platforms

Commit 978aa0474115 ("sctp: fix some type cast warnings introduced since
very beginning")' broke err reading from sctp_arg, because it reads the
value as 32-bit integer, although the value is stored as 16-bit integer.
Later this value is passed to the userspace in 16-bit variable, thus the
user always gets 0 on big-endian platforms. Fix it by reading the __u16
field of sctp_arg union, as reading err field would produce a sparse
warning.
