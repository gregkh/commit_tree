coresight: etm4x: Ensure default perf settings filter user/kernel

Moving from using an address filter to trace the default "all addresses"
range to no filtering to acheive the same result, has caused the perf
filtering of kernel/user address spaces from not working unless an
explicit address filter was used.

This is due to the original code using a side-effect of the address
filtering rather than setting the global TRCVICTLR exception level
filtering.

The use of the mode sysfs file is also similarly affected.

A helper function is added to fix both instances.
