media: videodev2.h: RGB BT2020 and HSV are always full range

The default RGB quantization range for BT.2020 is full range (just as for
all the other RGB pixel encodings), not limited range.

Update the V4L2_MAP_QUANTIZATION_DEFAULT macro and documentation
accordingly.

Also mention that HSV is always full range and cannot be limited range.

When RGB BT2020 was introduced in V4L2 it was not clear whether it should
be limited or full range, but full range is the right (and consistent)
choice.
