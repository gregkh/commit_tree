ARM: dts: sun8i: V3/V3s/S3/S3L: add pinctrl for 8-bit parallel CSI

The CSI1 controller of V3/V3s/S3/S3L SoCs is used for parallel CSI.

As we're going to add support for Pine64 SCC board, which uses 8-bit
parallel CSI (and the MCLK output), add the pinctrl node of 8-bit
CSI and MCLK to the DTSI file.
