btrfs: use sprout device_list_mutex in btrfs_init_devices_late

On a mounted sprout filesystem, all threads now are using the
sprout::device_list_mutex, and this is the only code using the
seed::device_list_mutex. This patch converts to use the sprouts
fs_info->fs_devices->device_list_mutex.

The same reasoning holds true here, that device delete is holding
the sprout::device_list_mutex.
