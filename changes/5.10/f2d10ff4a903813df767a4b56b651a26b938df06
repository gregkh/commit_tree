kgdb: Honour the kprobe blocklist when setting breakpoints

Currently kgdb has absolutely no safety rails in place to discourage or
prevent a user from placing a breakpoint in dangerous places such as
the debugger's own trap entry/exit and other places where it is not safe
to take synchronous traps.

Introduce a new config symbol KGDB_HONOUR_BLOCKLIST and modify the
default implementation of kgdb_validate_break_address() so that we use
the kprobe blocklist to prohibit instrumentation of critical functions
if the config symbol is set. The config symbol dependencies are set to
ensure that the blocklist will be enabled by default if we enable KGDB
and are compiling for an architecture where we HAVE_KPROBES.
