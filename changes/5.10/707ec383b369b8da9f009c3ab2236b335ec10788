net: dsa: refuse configuration in prepare phase of dsa_port_vlan_filtering()

The current logic beats me a little bit. The comment that "bridge skips
-EOPNOTSUPP, so skip the prepare phase" was introduced in commit
fb2dabad69f0 ("net: dsa: support VLAN filtering switchdev attr").

I'm not sure:
(a) ok, the bridge skips -EOPNOTSUPP, but, so what, where are we
    returning -EOPNOTSUPP?
(b) even if we are, and I'm just not seeing it, what is the causality
    relationship between the bridge skipping -EOPNOTSUPP and DSA
    skipping the prepare phase, and just returning zero?

One thing is certain beyond doubt though, and that is that DSA currently
refuses VLAN filtering from the "commit" phase instead of "prepare", and
that this is not a good thing:

ip link add br0 type bridge
ip link add br1 type bridge vlan_filtering 1
ip link set swp2 master br0
ip link set swp3 master br1

So move the current logic that may fail (except ds->ops->port_vlan_filtering,
that is way harder) into the prepare stage of the switchdev transaction.
