net: usb: rtl8150: don't incorrectly assign random MAC addresses

In set_ethernet_addr(), if get_registers() succeeds, the ethernet address
that was read must be copied over. Otherwise, a random ethernet address
must be assigned.

get_registers() returns 0 if successful, and negative error number
otherwise. However, in set_ethernet_addr(), this return value is
incorrectly checked.

Since this return value will never be equal to sizeof(node_id), a
random MAC address will always be generated and assigned to the
device; even in cases when get_registers() is successful.

Correctly modifying the condition that checks if get_registers() was
successful or not fixes this problem, and copies the ethernet address
appropriately.
