libbpf: Fix compatibility problem in xsk_socket__create

Fix a compatibility problem when the old XDP_SHARED_UMEM mode is used
together with the xsk_socket__create() call. In the old XDP_SHARED_UMEM
mode, only sharing of the same device and queue id was allowed, and
in this mode, the fill ring and completion ring were shared between
the AF_XDP sockets.

Therefore, it was perfectly fine to call the xsk_socket__create() API
for each socket and not use the new xsk_socket__create_shared() API.
This behavior was ruined by the commit introducing XDP_SHARED_UMEM
support between different devices and/or queue ids. This patch restores
the ability to use xsk_socket__create in these circumstances so that
backward compatibility is not broken.
