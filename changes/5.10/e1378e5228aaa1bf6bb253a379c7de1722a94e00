mt76: rely on AQL for burst size limits on tx queueing

Now that AQL works well on all mt76 drivers, completely replace the arbitrary
burst sizing and number of bursts logic for tx scheduling.
For the short period of time in which AQL does not work well yet, limit each
stations to 16 in-flight packets that have no estimated tx time.
This should avoid filling the queue if a station connects and queues up a
large number of packets before rate control information is available, especially
with hardware rate control
