ravb: Add support for explicit internal clock delay configuration

Some EtherAVB variants support internal clock delay configuration, which
can add larger delays than the delays that are typically supported by
the PHY (using an "rgmii-*id" PHY mode, and/or "[rt]xc-skew-ps"
properties).

Historically, the EtherAVB driver configured these delays based on the
"rgmii-*id" PHY mode.  This caused issues with PHY drivers that
implement PHY internal delays properly[1].  Hence a backwards-compatible
workaround was added by masking the PHY mode[2].

Add proper support for explicit configuration of the MAC internal clock
delays using the new "[rt]x-internal-delay-ps" properties.
Fall back to the old handling if none of these properties is present.

    delays twice").
