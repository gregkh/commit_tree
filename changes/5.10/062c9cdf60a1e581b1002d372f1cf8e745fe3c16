pwm: sl28cpld: fix getting driver data in pwm callbacks

Currently .get_state() and .apply() use dev_get_drvdata() on the struct
device related to the pwm chip.  This only works after .probe() called
platform_set_drvdata() which in this driver happens only after
pwmchip_add() and so comes possibly too late.

Instead of setting the driver data earlier use the traditional
container_of approach as this way the driver data is conceptually and
computational nearer.
