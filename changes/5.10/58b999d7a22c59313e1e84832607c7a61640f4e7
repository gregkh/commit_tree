kasan: adopt KUNIT tests to SW_TAGS mode

Now that we have KASAN-KUNIT tests integration, it's easy to see that
some KASAN tests are not adopted to the SW_TAGS mode and are failing.

Adjust the allocation size for kasan_memchr() and kasan_memcmp() by
roung it up to OOB_TAG_OFF so the bad access ends up in a separate
memory granule.

Add a new kmalloc_uaf_16() tests that relies on UAF, and a new
kasan_bitops_tags() test that is tailored to tag-based mode, as it's
hard to adopt the existing kmalloc_oob_16() and kasan_bitops_generic()
(renamed from kasan_bitops()) without losing the precision.

Add new kmalloc_uaf_16() and kasan_bitops_uaf() tests that rely on UAFs,
as it's hard to adopt the existing kmalloc_oob_16() and
kasan_bitops_oob() (rename from kasan_bitops()) without losing the
precision.

Disable kasan_global_oob() and kasan_alloca_oob_left/right() as SW_TAGS
mode doesn't instrument globals nor dynamic allocas.
