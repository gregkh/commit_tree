net: ethernet: ti: ale: switch to use tables for vlan entry description

The ALE VLAN entries are too much differ between different TI CPSW ALE
versions. So, handling them using flags, defines and get/set functions
became over-complicated.

This patch introduces tables to describe the ALE VLAN entries fields, which
are different between TI CPSW ALE versions, and new get/set access
functions. It also allows to detect incorrect access to not available ALL
entry fields.
