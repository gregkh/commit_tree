regulator: pfuze100: limit pfuze-support-disable-sw to pfuze{100,200}

Limit the fsl,pfuze-support-disable-sw to the pfuze100 and pfuze200
variants.
When enabling fsl,pfuze-support-disable-sw and using a pfuze3000 or
pfuze3001, the driver would choose pfuze100_sw_disable_regulator_ops
instead of the newly introduced and correct pfuze3000_sw_regulator_ops.
