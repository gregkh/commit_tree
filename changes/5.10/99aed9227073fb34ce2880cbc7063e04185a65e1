device property: Don't clear secondary pointer for shared primary firmware node

It appears that firmware nodes can be shared between devices. In such case
when a (child) device is about to be deleted, its firmware node may be shared
and ACPI_COMPANION_SET(..., NULL) call for it breaks the secondary link
of the shared primary firmware node.

In order to prevent that, check, if the device has a parent and parent's
firmware node is shared with its child, and avoid crashing the link.
