ARM: OMAP2+: Drop legacy platform data for am3 and am4 rtc

We can now probe devices with ti-sysc interconnect driver and dts
data. Let's drop the related platform data and custom ti,hwmods
dts property.

As we're just dropping data, and the early platform data init
is based on the custom ti,hwmods property, we want to drop both
the platform data and ti,hwmods property in a single patch.

Note that we also must tag rtc as disabled on am43x-epos-evm as
it's not accessible according to commit 4321dc8dff35 ("ARM: AM43XX:
hwmod: Add rtc hwmod"). And we must keep RTC enabled for rtcwake
to work now that we've removed the custom platfor code for
re-enabling the RTC on suspend.
