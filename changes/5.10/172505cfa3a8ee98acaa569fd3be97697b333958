RDMA/hns: Add check for the validity of sl configuration

According to the RoCE v1 specification, the sl (service level) 0-7 are
mapped directly to priorities 0-7 respectively, sl 8-15 are reserved. The
driver should verify whether the the value of sl is larger than 7, if so,
an exception should be returned.
