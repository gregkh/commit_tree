drm/i915/ddi: Don't frob the DP link scramble disabling flag

According to BSpec this flag should not be changed while the DDI
function is enabled. On BDW+ the DP_TP_CTL register spec also states it
explicitly that the HW takes care of enabling/disabling the scrambling
for training patterns (and it must stay enabled for normal pixel
output). Assume that this HW automatic handling of scrambling is also
true for HSW.

BSpec: 8013, 7557, 50484
