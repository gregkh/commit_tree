stop_machine, rcu: Mark functions as notrace

Some architectures assume that the stopped CPUs don't make function calls
to traceable functions when they are in the stopped state. See also commit
cb9d7fd51d9f ("watchdog: Mark watchdog touch functions as notrace").

Violating this assumption causes kernel crashes when switching tracer on
RISC-V.

Mark rcu_momentary_dyntick_idle() and stop_machine_yield() notrace to
prevent this.

Fixes: 366237e7b083 ("stop_machine: Provide RCU quiescent state in multi_cpu_stop()")
