clk: sunxi-ng: sun8i: r40: Use sigma delta modulation for audio PLL

Audio cores need specific clock rates which can't be simply obtained by
adjusting integer multipliers and dividers. HW for such cases supports
delta-sigma modulation which enables fractional multipliers.

Port H3 delta-sigma table to R40. They have identical audio PLLs.
