dt-bindings: net: renesas,ravb: Document internal clock delay properties

Some EtherAVB variants support internal clock delay configuration, which
can add larger delays than the delays that are typically supported by
the PHY (using an "rgmii-*id" PHY mode, and/or "[rt]xc-skew-ps"
properties).

Add properties for configuring the internal MAC delays.
These properties are mandatory, even when specified as zero, to
distinguish between old and new DTBs.

Update the (bogus) example accordingly.
