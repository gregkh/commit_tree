firmware: arm_sdei: Remove while loop in sdei_event_register()

This removes the unnecessary while loop in sdei_event_register()
because of the following two reasons. This shouldn't cause any
functional changes.

   * The while loop is executed for once, meaning it's not needed
     in theory.
   * With the while loop removed, the nested statements can be
     avoid to make the code a bit cleaner.
