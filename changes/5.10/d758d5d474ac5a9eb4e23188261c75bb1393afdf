perf tools: Separate the checking of headers only used to build beautification tables

Some headers are not used in building the tools directly, but instead to
generate tables that then gets source code included to do id->string and
string->id lookups for things like syscall flags and commands.

We were adding it directly to tools/include/ and this sometimes gets in
the way of building using system headers, lets untangle this a bit.
