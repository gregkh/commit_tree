gen_compile_commands: parse only the first line of .*.cmd files

After the allmodconfig build, this script takes about 5 sec on my
machine. Most of the run-time is consumed for needless regex matching.

We know the format of .*.cmd file; the first line is the build command.
There is no need to parse the rest.

With this optimization, now it runs 4 times faster.
