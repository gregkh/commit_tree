mptcp: allow picking different xmit subflows

Update the scheduler to less trivial heuristic: cache
the last used subflow, and try to send on it a reasonably
long burst of data.

When the burst or the subflow send space is exhausted, pick
the subflow with the lower ratio between write space and
send buffer - that is, the subflow with the greater relative
amount of free space.

v1 -> v2:
 - fix 32 bit build breakage due to 64bits div
 - fix checkpath issues (uint64_t -> u64)
