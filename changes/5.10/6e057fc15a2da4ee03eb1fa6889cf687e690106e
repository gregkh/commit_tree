selftests/bpf: Define string const as global for test_sysctl_prog.c

When tweaking llvm optimizations, I found that selftest build failed
with the following error:
  libbpf: elf: skipping unrecognized data section(6) .rodata.str1.1
  libbpf: prog 'sysctl_tcp_mem': bad map relo against '.L__const.is_tcp_mem.tcp_mem_name'
          in section '.rodata.str1.1'
  Error: failed to open BPF object file: Relocation failed
  make: *** [/work/net-next/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_sysctl_prog.skel.h] Error 255
  make: *** Deleting file `/work/net-next/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_sysctl_prog.skel.h'

The local string constant "tcp_mem_name" is put into '.rodata.str1.1' section
which libbpf cannot handle. Using untweaked upstream llvm, "tcp_mem_name"
is completely inlined after loop unrolling.

Commit 7fb5eefd7639 ("selftests/bpf: Fix test_sysctl_loop{1, 2}
failure due to clang change") solved a similar problem by defining
the string const as a global. Let us do the same here
for test_sysctl_prog.c so it can weather future potential llvm changes.
