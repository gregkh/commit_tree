interconnect: qcom: Support bcm-voter-specific TCS wait behavior

Currently, all bcm-voters set tcs_cmd::wait=true for the last VCD
command in each TCS (AMC, WAKE, and SLEEP). However, some bcm-voters
don't need the completion and instead need to optimize for latency. For
instance, disabling wait-for-completion in the WAKE set can decrease
resume latency and allow for certain operations to occur in parallel
with the WAKE TCS triggering. This is only safe in very specific
situations. Keep the default behavior of always waiting, but allow it to
be overridden in devicetree.
