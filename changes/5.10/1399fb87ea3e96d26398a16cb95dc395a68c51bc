ath11k: register MHI controller device for QCA6390

Modem Host Interface (MHI) is a communication protocol to communicate with
external Qualcomm modems and Wi-Fi chipsets over high speed peripheral buses.
Even though MHI doesnâ€™t dictate underlying physical layer, protocol and MHI
stack is structured for PCI based devices.

Register directly with MHI subsystem as a MHI device driver for firmware
download to QCA6390.
