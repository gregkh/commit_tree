irqchip/bcm2836: Configure mailbox interrupts as standard interrupts

In order to switch the bcm2836 driver to privide standard interrupts
for IPIs, it first needs to stop lying about the way things work.

The mailbox interrupt is actually a multiplexer, with enough
bits to store 32 pending interrupts per CPU. So let's turn it
into a chained irqchip.

Once this is done, we can instanciate the corresponding IPIs,
and pass them to the architecture code.
