KVM: x86/mmu: Hoist ITLB multi-hit workaround check up a level

Move the "ITLB multi-hit workaround enabled" check into the callers of
disallowed_hugepage_adjust() to make it more obvious that the helper is
specific to the workaround, and to be consistent with the accounting,
i.e. account_huge_nx_page() is called if and only if the workaround is
enabled.

No functional change intended.
