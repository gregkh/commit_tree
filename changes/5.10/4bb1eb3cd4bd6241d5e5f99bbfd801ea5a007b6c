arm64: dts: actions: limit address range for pinctrl node

After commit 7cdf8446ed1d ("arm64: dts: actions: Add pinctrl node for
Actions Semi S700") following error has been observed while booting
Linux on Cubieboard7-lite(based on S700 SoC).

[    0.257415] pinctrl-s700 e01b0000.pinctrl: can't request region for
resource [mem 0xe01b0000-0xe01b0fff]
[    0.266902] pinctrl-s700: probe of e01b0000.pinctrl failed with error -16

This is due to the fact that memory range for "sps" power domain controller
clashes with pinctrl.

One way to fix it, is to limit pinctrl address range which is safe
to do as current pinctrl driver uses address range only up to 0x100.

This commit limits the pinctrl address range to 0x100 so that it doesn't
conflict with sps range.

Fixes: 7cdf8446ed1d ("arm64: dts: actions: Add pinctrl node for Actions
Semi S700")
