net/mlx5e: Small improvements for XDP TX MPWQE logic

Use MLX5E_XDP_MPW_MAX_WQEBBS to reserve space for a MPWQE, because it's
actually the maximal size a MPWQE can take.

Reorganize the logic that checks when to close the MPWQE session:

1. Put all checks into a single function.

2. When inline is on, make only one comparison - if it's false, the less
strict one will also be false. The compiler probably optimized it out
anyway, but it's clearer to also reflect it in the code.

The MLX5E_XDP_INLINE_WQE_* defines are also changed to make the
calculations more correct from the logical point of view. Though
MLX5E_XDP_INLINE_WQE_MAX_DS_CNT used to be 16 and didn't change its
value, the calculation used to be DIV_ROUND_UP(max inline packet size,
MLX5_SEND_WQE_DS), and the numerator should have included sizeof(struct
mlx5_wqe_inline_seg).
