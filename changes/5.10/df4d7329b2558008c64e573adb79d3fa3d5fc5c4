scsi: ibmvfc: Interface updates for future FPIN and MQ support

VIOS partitions with SLI-4 enabled Emulex adapters will be capable of
driving I/O in parallel through mulitple work queues or channels, and with
new hypervisor firmware that supports multiple interrupt sources an ibmvfc
NPIV single initiator can be modified to exploit end-to-end channelization
in a PowerVM environment.

VIOS hosts will also be able to expose fabric perfromance impact
notifications (FPIN) via a new asynchronous event to ibmvfc clients that
advertise support via IBMVFC_CAN_HANDLE_FPIN in their capabilities flag
during NPIV_LOGIN.

This patch introduces three new Management Datagrams (MADs) for
channelization support negotiation as well as the FPIN asynchronous
event and FPIN status flags. Follow up work is required to plumb the
ibmvfc client driver to use these new interfaces.
