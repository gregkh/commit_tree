crypto: hisilicon/qm - fix the process of register algorithms to crypto

When the devices are removed or not existing, the corresponding algorithms
which are registered by 'hisi-zip' driver can't be used.

Move 'hisi_zip_register_to_crypto' from 'hisi_zip_init' to
'hisi_zip_probe'. The algorithms will be registered to crypto only when
there is device bind on the driver. And when the devices are removed,
the algorithms will be unregistered.

In the previous process, the function 'xxx_register_to_crypto' need a lock
and a static variable to judge if the registration is the first time.
Move this action into the function 'hisi_qm_alg_register'. Each device
will call 'hisi_qm_alg_register' to add itself to qm list in probe process
and registering algs when the qm list is empty.
