net: dsa: ocelot: use the Lynx PCS helpers in Felix and Seville

Use the helper functions introduced by the newly added
Lynx PCS MDIO module in the Felix VSC9959 and Seville VSC9953.

Instead of representing the PCS as a phy_device, a mdio_device structure
will be passed to the Lynx module which is now actually implementing all
the PCS configuration and status reporting.

All code previously used for PCS monitoring and runtime configuration
is removed and replaced will calls to the Lynx PCS operations.

Tested on the following SERDES protocols of LS1028A: 0x7777
(2500Base-X), 0x85bb (QSGMII), 0x9999 (SGMII) and 0x13bb (USXGMII).
