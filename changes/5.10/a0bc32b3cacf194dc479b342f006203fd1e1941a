x86/mce: Increase maximum number of banks to 64

...because future AMD systems will support up to 64 MCA banks per CPU.

MAX_NR_BANKS is used to allocate a number of data structures, and it is
used as a ceiling for values read from MCG_CAP[Count]. Therefore, this
change will have no functional effect on existing systems with 32 or
fewer MCA banks per CPU.

However, this will increase the size of the following structures:

Global bitmaps:
- core.c / mce_banks_ce_disabled
- core.c / all_banks
- core.c / valid_banks
- core.c / toclear
- Total: 32 new bits * 4 bitmaps = 16 new bytes

Per-CPU bitmaps:
- core.c / mce_poll_banks
- intel.c / mce_banks_owned
- Total: 32 new bits * 2 bitmaps = 8 new bytes

The bitmaps are arrays of longs. So this change will only affect 32-bit
execution, since there will be one additional long used. There will be
no additional memory use on 64-bit execution, because the size of long
is 64 bits.

Global structs:
- amd.c / struct smca_bank smca_banks[]: 16 bytes per bank
- core.c / struct mce_bank_dev mce_bank_devs[]: 56 bytes per bank
- Total: 32 new banks * (16 + 56) bytes = 2304 new bytes

Per-CPU structs:
- core.c / struct mce_bank mce_banks_array[]: 16 bytes per bank
- Total: 32 new banks * 16 bytes = 512 new bytes

32-bit
Total global size increase: 2320 bytes
Total per-CPU size increase: 520 bytes

64-bit
Total global size increase: 2304 bytes
Total per-CPU size increase: 512 bytes

This additional memory should still fit within the existing .data
section of the kernel binary. However, in the case where it doesn't
fit, an additional page (4kB) of memory will be added to the binary to
accommodate the extra data which will be the maximum size increase of
vmlinux.
