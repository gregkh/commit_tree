lockdep/Documention: Recursive read lock detection reasoning

This patch add the documentation piece for the reasoning of deadlock
detection related to recursive read lock. The following sections are
added:

*	Explain what is a recursive read lock, and what deadlock cases
	they could introduce.

*	Introduce the notations for different types of dependencies, and
	the definition of strong paths.

*	Proof for a closed strong path is both sufficient and necessary
	for deadlock detections with recursive read locks involved. The
	proof could also explain why we call the path "strong"
