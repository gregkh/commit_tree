drm/amd/display: Avoid HDCP initialization in devices without output

The HDCP feature requires at least one connector attached to the device;
however, some GPUs do not have a physical output, making the HDCP
initialization irrelevant. This patch disables HDCP initialization when
the graphic card does not have output.
