bpf: tcp: Do not limit cb_flags when creating child sk from listen sk

The commit 0813a841566f ("bpf: tcp: Allow bpf prog to write and parse TCP header option")
unnecessarily introduced bpf_skops_init_child() which limited the child
sk from inheriting all bpf_sock_ops_cb_flags of the listen sk.  That
breaks existing user expectation.

This patch removes the bpf_skops_init_child() and just allows
sock_copy() to do its job to copy everything from listen sk to
the child sk.
