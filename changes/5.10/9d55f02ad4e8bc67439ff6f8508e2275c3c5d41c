x86/msi: Remove pointless vcpu_affinity callback

Setting the irq_set_vcpu_affinity() callback to
irq_chip_set_vcpu_affinity_parent() is a pointless exercise because the
function which utilizes it searchs the domain hierarchy to find a parent
domain which has such a callback.

Remove the useless indirection.
