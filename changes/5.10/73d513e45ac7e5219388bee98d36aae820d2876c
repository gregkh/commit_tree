media: venus: Add new interface queues reinit

Presently the recovery mechanism is using two hfi functions
to destroy and create interface queues. For the purpose of
recovery we don't need to free and allocate the memory used
for interface message queues, that's why we introduce new
function which just reinit the queues.  Also this will give
to the recovery procedure one less reason to fail (if for
some reason we couldn't allocate memory).
