libbpf: Fix unintentional success return code in bpf_object__load

There are code paths where EINVAL is returned directly without setting
errno. In that case, errno could be 0, which would mask the
failure. For example, if a careless programmer set log_level to 10000
out of laziness, they would have to spend a long time trying to figure
out why.
