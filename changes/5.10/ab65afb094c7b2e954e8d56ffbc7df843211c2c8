sched/topology: Remove SD_SERIALIZE degeneration special case

If there is only a single NUMA node in the system, the only NUMA topology
level that will be generated will be NODE (identity distance), which
doesn't have SD_SERIALIZE.

This means we don't need this special case in sd_parent_degenerate(), as
having the NODE level "naturally" covers it. Thus, remove it.
