objtool: Ignore unreachable fake jumps

It is possible for alternative code to unconditionally jump out of the
alternative region. In such a case, if a fake jump is added at the end
of the alternative instructions, the fake jump will never be reached.
Since the fake jump is just a mean to make sure code validation does not
go beyond the set of alternatives, reaching it is not a requirement.
