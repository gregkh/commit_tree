drm/i915: Force VT'd workarounds when running as a guest OS

If i915.ko is being used as a passthrough device, it does not know if
the host is using intel_iommu. Mixing the iommu and gfx causes a few
issues (such as scanout overfetch) which we need to workaround inside
the driver, so if we detect we are running under a hypervisor, also
assume the device access is being virtualised.
