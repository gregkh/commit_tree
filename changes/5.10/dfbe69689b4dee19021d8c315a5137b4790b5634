vmlinux.lds.h: Add .gnu.version* to COMMON_DISCARDS

For vmlinux linking, no architecture uses the .gnu.version* sections,
so remove it via the COMMON_DISCARDS macro in preparation for adding
--orphan-handling=warn more widely. This is a work-around for what
appears to be a bug[1] in ld.bfd which warns for this synthetic section
even when none is found in input objects, and even when no section is
emitted for an output object[2].
