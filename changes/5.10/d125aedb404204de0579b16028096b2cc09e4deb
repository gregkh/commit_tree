powerpc/eeh: Rework EEH initialisation

Drop the EEH register / unregister ops thing and have the platform pass the
ops structure into eeh_init() directly. This takes one initcall out of the
EEH setup path and it means we're only doing EEH setup on the platforms
which actually support it. It's also less code and generally easier to
follow.

No functional changes.
