lib/crc32.c: fix trivial typo in preprocessor condition

Whether crc32_be needs a lookup table is chosen based on CRC_LE_BITS.
Obviously, the _be function should be governed by the _BE_ define.

This probably never pops up as it's hard to come up with a configuration
where CRC_BE_BITS isn't the same as CRC_LE_BITS and as nobody is using
bitwise CRC anyway.
