bpf: Fix potential call bpf_link_free() in atomic context

The in_atomic() macro cannot always detect atomic context, in particular,
it cannot know about held spinlocks in non-preemptible kernels. Although,
there is no user call bpf_link_put() with holding spinlock now, be on the
safe side, so we can avoid this in the future.
