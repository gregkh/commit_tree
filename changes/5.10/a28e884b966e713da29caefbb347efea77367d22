seqlock: Fix multiple kernel-doc warnings

Fix kernel-doc warnings in <linux/seqlock.h>.

../include/linux/seqlock.h:152: warning: Incorrect use of kernel-doc format:  * seqcount_LOCKNAME_init() - runtime initializer for seqcount_LOCKNAME_t
../include/linux/seqlock.h:164: warning: Incorrect use of kernel-doc format:  * SEQCOUNT_LOCKTYPE() - Instantiate seqcount_LOCKNAME_t and helpers
../include/linux/seqlock.h:229: warning: Function parameter or member 'seq_name' not described in 'SEQCOUNT_LOCKTYPE_ZERO'
../include/linux/seqlock.h:229: warning: Function parameter or member 'assoc_lock' not described in 'SEQCOUNT_LOCKTYPE_ZERO'
../include/linux/seqlock.h:229: warning: Excess function parameter 'name' description in 'SEQCOUNT_LOCKTYPE_ZERO'
../include/linux/seqlock.h:229: warning: Excess function parameter 'lock' description in 'SEQCOUNT_LOCKTYPE_ZERO'
../include/linux/seqlock.h:695: warning: duplicate section name 'NOTE'

Demote kernel-doc notation for the macros "seqcount_LOCKNAME_init()" and
"SEQCOUNT_LOCKTYPE()"; scripts/kernel-doc does not handle them correctly.

Rename function parameters in SEQCNT_LOCKNAME_ZERO() documentation
to match the macro's argument names. Change the macro name in the
documentation to SEQCOUNT_LOCKTYPE_ZERO() to match the macro's name.

For raw_write_seqcount_latch(), rename the second NOTE: to NOTE2:
to prevent a kernel-doc warning. However, the generated output is not
quite as nice as it could be for this.

Fix a typo: s/LOCKTYPR/LOCKTYPE/

Fixes: e4e9ab3f9f91 ("seqlock: Fold seqcount_LOCKNAME_init() definition")
