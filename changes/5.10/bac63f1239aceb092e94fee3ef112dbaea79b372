media: vb2: set cache sync hints when init buffers

We need to set ->need_cache_sync_on_prepare and
->need_cache_sync_on_finish when we initialize vb2 buffer.

Currently these flags are set/adjusted only in V4L2's
vb2_queue_or_prepare_buf(), which means that for the code
paths that don't use V4L2 vb2 will always tell videobuf2
core to skip ->prepare() and ->finish() cache syncs/flushes.
Fix this by setting cache sync hints for new buffers; except
VB2_MEMORY_DMABUF buffers, for which DMA exporter syncs
caches.
