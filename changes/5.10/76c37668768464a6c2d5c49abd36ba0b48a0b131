builddeb: Add support for all required debian/rules targets

These have been required by the Debian policy for a while, even though
the tooling can detect and workaround their omission, but are a hard
requirement when using rootless builds.

[masahiro:
The following Debian policy is particularly important for rootless builds:
"Both binary-* targets should depend on the build target, or on the
 appropriate build-arch or build-indep target, so that the package is
 built if it has not been already."
