dm writecache: remove BUG() and fail gracefully instead

Building on arch/s390/ results in this build error:

cc1: some warnings being treated as errors
../drivers/md/dm-writecache.c: In function 'persistent_memory_claim':
../drivers/md/dm-writecache.c:323:1: error: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Werror=return-type]

Fix this by replacing the BUG() with an -EOPNOTSUPP return.

Fixes: 48debafe4f2f ("dm: add writecache target")
