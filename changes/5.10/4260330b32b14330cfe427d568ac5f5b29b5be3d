bnxt_en: read EEPROM A2h address using page 0

The module eeprom address range returned by bnxt_get_module_eeprom()
should be 256 bytes of A0h address space, the lower half of the A2h
address space, and page 0 for the upper half of the A2h address space.

Fix the firmware call by passing page_number 0 for the A2h slave address
space.
