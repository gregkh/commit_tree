net: dsa: Call dsa_untag_bridge_pvid() from dsa_switch_rcv()

When a DSA switch driver needs to call dsa_untag_bridge_pvid(), it can
set dsa_switch::untag_brige_pvid to indicate this is necessary.

This is a pre-requisite to making sure that we are always calling
dsa_untag_bridge_pvid() after eth_type_trans() has been called.
