misc: pci_endpoint_test: Add driver data for Layerscape PCIe controllers

The commit 0a121f9bc3f5 ("misc: pci_endpoint_test: Use streaming DMA
APIs for buffer allocation") changed to use streaming DMA APIs, however,
dma_map_single() might not return a 4KB aligned address, so add the
default_data as driver data for Layerscape PCIe controllers to make it
4KB aligned.
