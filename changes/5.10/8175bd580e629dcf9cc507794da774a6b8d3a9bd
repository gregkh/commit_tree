powerpc/pseries/eeh: Fix use of uninitialised variable

If the RTAS call to query the PE address for a device fails we jump the
err: label where an error message is printed along with the return code.
However, the printed return code is from the "ret" variable which isn't set
at that point since we assigned the result to "addr" instead. Fix this by
consistently using the "ret" variable for the result of the RTAS call
helpers an dropping the "addr" local variable"
