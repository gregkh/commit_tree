nfc: s3fwrn5: use signed integer for parsing GPIO numbers

GPIOs - as returned by of_get_named_gpio() and used by the gpiolib - are
signed integers, where negative number indicates error.  The return
value of of_get_named_gpio() should not be assigned to an unsigned int
because in case of !CONFIG_GPIOLIB such number would be a valid GPIO.
