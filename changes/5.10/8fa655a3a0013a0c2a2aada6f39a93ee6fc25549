tracing: Fix alignment of static buffer

With 5.9 kernel on ARM64, I found ftrace_dump output was broken but
it had no problem with normal output "cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace".

With investigation, it seems coping the data into temporal buffer seems to
break the align binary printf expects if the static buffer is not aligned
with 4-byte. IIUC, get_arg in bstr_printf expects that args has already
right align to be decoded and seq_buf_bprintf says ``the arguments are saved
in a 32bit word array that is defined by the format string constraints``.
So if we don't keep the align under copy to temporal buffer, the output
will be broken by shifting some bytes.

This patch fixes it.
