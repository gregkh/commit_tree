taskstats: move specifying netlink policy back to ops

commit 3b0f31f2b8c9 ("genetlink: make policy common to family")
had to work around removal of policy from ops by parsing in
the pre_doit callback. Now that policy is back in full ops
we can switch again. Set maxattr to actual size of the policies
- both commands set GENL_DONT_VALIDATE_STRICT so out of range
attributes will be silently ignored, anyway.

v2:
 - remove stale comment
