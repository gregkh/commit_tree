ASoC: Intel: catpt: Implement IPC protocol

Implement IRQ handlers for immediate and delayed replies and
notifications. Communication is synchronous and allows for serialization
of maximum one message at a time.

DSP may respond with ADSP_PENDING status for a request - known as
delayed reply - and when situation occurs, framework keeps the lock and
awaits upcoming response through IPCD channel which is handled in
bottom-half. Immediate replies spawn no BH at all as their processing is
very short.
