ASoC: tas2562: Add the TAS2110 class-D amplifier

Add the TAS2110 amplifier to the TAS2562 driver. The TAS2110 is register
and bitmap compatible. The chips differ in that the TAS2110 does not
have the I/V Sense feedback path. Since these features do not exist the
device needs to be registered without these controls.
