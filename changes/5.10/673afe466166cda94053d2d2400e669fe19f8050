hwmon: use simple i2c probe function (take 2)

Many hwmon drivers don't use the id information provided by the old
i2c probe function, and the remainder can easily be adapted to the new
form ("probe_new") by calling i2c_match_id explicitly.

This avoids scanning the identifier tables during probes.

Drivers which didn't use the id are converted as-is; drivers which did
are modified to call i2c_match_id() with the same level of
error-handling (if any) as before.

This patch wraps up the transition for hwmon, with four stragglers not
included in the previous large patch.
