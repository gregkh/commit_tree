mwifiex: don't call del_timer_sync() on uninitialized timer

syzbot is reporting that del_timer_sync() is called from
mwifiex_usb_cleanup_tx_aggr() from mwifiex_unregister_dev() without
checking timer_setup() from mwifiex_usb_tx_init() was called [1].

Ganapathi Bhat proposed a possibly cleaner fix, but it seems that
that fix was forgotten [2].

"grep -FrB1 'del_timer' drivers/ | grep -FA1 '.function)'" says that
currently there are 28 locations which call del_timer[_sync]() only if
that timer's function field was initialized (because timer_setup() sets
that timer's function field). Therefore, let's use same approach here.
