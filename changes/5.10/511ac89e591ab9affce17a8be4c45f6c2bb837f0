smb3.1.1: print warning if server does not support requested encryption type

If server does not support AES-256-GCM and it was required on mount, print
warning message. Also log and return a different error message (EOPNOTSUPP)
when encryption mechanism is not supported vs the case when an unknown
unrequested encryption mechanism could be returned (EINVAL).
