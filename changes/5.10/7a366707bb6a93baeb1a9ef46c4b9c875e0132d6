soc: qcom: pdr: Fixup array type of get_domain_list_resp message

The array type of get_domain_list_resp is incorrectly marked as NO_ARRAY.
Due to which the following error was observed when using pdr helpers with
the downstream proprietary pd-mapper. Fix this up by marking it as
VAR_LEN_ARRAY instead.

Err logs:
