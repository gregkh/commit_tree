drm/i915/display: Implement HOBL

Hours Of Battery Life is a new GEN12+ power-saving feature that allows
supported motherboards to use a special voltage swing table for eDP
panels that uses less power.

So here if supported by HW, OEM will set it in VBT and i915 will try
to train link with HOBL vswing table if link training fails it fall
back to the original table.

intel_ddi_dp_preemph_max() was optimized to only check the HOBL flag
instead of do something like is done in intel_ddi_dp_voltage_max()
because it is only called after the first entry of the voltage swing
table was loaded so the HOBL flag is valid at that point.

v3:
- removed a few parameters of icl_ddi_combo_vswing_program() that
can be taken from encoder

v4:
- using the HOBL vswing table until training fails completely (Ville)

v5:
- not reducing lane or link rate when link training fails with HOBL
active
- duplicated the HOBL voltage swing entry to match DP spec requirement

v6:
- removed the optional VS 3 & pre-emp 0 from HOBL table
- changed from u8:1 to bool to store hobl_failed/active
