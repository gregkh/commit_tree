powerpc/smp: Optimize update_coregroup_mask

All threads of a SMT4/SMT8 core can either be part of CPU's coregroup
mask or outside the coregroup. Use this relation to reduce the
number of iterations needed to find all the CPUs that share the same
coregroup

Use a temporary mask to iterate through the CPUs that may share
coregroup mask. Also instead of setting one CPU at a time into
cpu_coregroup_mask, copy the SMT4/SMT8/submask at one shot.
