firmware: arm_sdei: Cleanup on cross call function

This applies cleanup on the cross call functions, no functional
changes are introduced:

   * Wrap the code block of CROSSCALL_INIT inside "do { } while (0)"
     as linux kernel usually does. Otherwise, scripts/checkpatch.pl
     reports warning regarding this.
   * Use smp_call_func_t for @fn argument in sdei_do_cross_call()
     as the function is called on target CPU(s).
   * Remove unnecessary space before @event in sdei_do_cross_call()
