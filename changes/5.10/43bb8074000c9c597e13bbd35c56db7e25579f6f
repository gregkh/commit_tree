arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Add VFE1_GDSC power domain to camss node

As the MSM8996 has two VFE IP-blocks, and each has a power domain,
both of them have to be enabled. Previously only the power domain
of VFE0 was enabled, but not the domain for VFE1.

This patch adds the VFE1_GDSC power domain to the camss device tree
node of the MSM8996 soc.
