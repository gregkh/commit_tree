PM: AVS: rockchip-io: Move the driver to the rockchip specific drivers

The avs drivers are all SoC specific drivers that doesn't share any code.
Instead they are located in a directory, mostly to keep similar
functionality together. From a maintenance point of view, it makes better
sense to collect SoC specific drivers like these, into the SoC specific
directories.

Therefore, let's move the rockchip-io driver to the rockchip directory.
