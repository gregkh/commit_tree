ASOC: Intel: sof_sdw: restore playback functionality with max98373 amps

The Max98373 amplifier provides I/V feedback information, which keeps
a DAPM path active even when there is no playback happening. This
prevents entry in low-power mode. Rather than adding new controls and
require UCM/user interaction, the method previously applied is to
enable/disable the Speaker pin during the dailink trigger operations.

Recent changes in the SoundWire stream management moved the stream
trigger to the dailink trigger. This change removed the Maxim-specific
pin handling and resulted in a regression. This patch restores
functionality by combining the SoundWire stream trigger with the pin
enable/disable.
