mm: memcontrol: use the preferred form for passing the size of a structure type

Use the preferred form for passing the size of a structure type.  The
alternative form where the structure type is spelled out hurts readability
and introduces an opportunity for a bug when the object type is changed
but the corresponding object identifier to which the sizeof operator is
applied is not.
