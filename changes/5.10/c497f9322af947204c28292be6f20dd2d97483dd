interconnect: qcom: msm8916: Remove rpm-ids from non-RPM nodes

Some nodes are incorrectly marked as RPM-controlled (they have RPM
master and slave ids assigned), but are actually controlled by the
application CPU instead. The RPM complains when we send requests for
resources that it can't control. Let's fix this by replacing the IDs,
with the default "-1" in which case no requests are sent.
