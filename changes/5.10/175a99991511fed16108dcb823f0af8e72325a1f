powerpc/8xx: Refactor calculation of number of entries per PTE in page tables

On 8xx, the number of entries occupied by a PTE in the page tables
depends on the size of the page. At the time being, this calculation
is done in two places: in pte_update() and in set_huge_pte_at()

Refactor this calculation into a helper called
number_of_cells_per_pte(). For the time being, the val param is
unused. It will be used by following patch.

Instead of opencoding is_hugepd(), use hugepd_ok() with a forward
declaration.
