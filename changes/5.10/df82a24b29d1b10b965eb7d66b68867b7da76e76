KVM: nVMX: Ensure vmcs01 is the loaded VMCS when freeing nested state

Add a WARN in free_nested() to ensure vmcs01 is loaded prior to freeing
vmcs02 and friends, and explicitly switch to vmcs01 if it's not.  KVM is
supposed to keep is_guest_mode() and loaded_vmcs==vmcs02 synchronized,
but bugs happen and freeing vmcs02 while it's in use will escalate a KVM
error to a use-after-free and potentially crash the kernel.

Do the WARN and switch even in the !vmxon case to help detect latent
bugs.  free_nested() is not a hot path, and the check is cheap.
