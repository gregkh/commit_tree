mac80211: support using ieee80211_tx_status_ext to free skbs without status info

For encap-offloaded packets, ieee80211_free_txskb cannot be used, since it
does not have the vif pointer.
Using ieee80211_tx_status_ext for this purpose has the advantage of being able
avoid an extra station lookup for AQL
