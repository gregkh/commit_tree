crypto: testmgr - Fix potential memory leak in test_akcipher_one()

When the 'key' allocation fails, the 'req' will not be released,
which will cause memory leakage on this path. This patch adds a
'free_req' tag used to solve this problem, and two new err values
are added to reflect the real reason of the error.
