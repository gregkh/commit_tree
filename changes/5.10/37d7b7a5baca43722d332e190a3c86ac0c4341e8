ARM: dts: imx6dl-yapp4: Add support for OLED based on different controller

OLED display consist of an OLED panel and a display controller.
The displays that were used on yapp4 platform were based on a SSD1305
controller. These displays are now discontinued and we need to add
support for a replacement.

The new display is based on SSD1309 controller and requires slightly
different configuration (mirror + segment offset).  We want to support
both display types so it does no matter which one was used on the assembly
line. Hence the displays are placed at different I2C addresses.
