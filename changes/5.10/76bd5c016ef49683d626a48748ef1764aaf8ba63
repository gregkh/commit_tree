NFSv4: make cache consistency bitmask dynamic

Client uses static bitmask for GETATTR on CLOSE/WRITE/DELEGRETURN
and ignores the fact that it might have some attributes marked
invalid in its cache. Compared to v3 where all attributes are
retrieved in postop attributes, v4's cache is frequently out of
sync and leads to standalone GETATTRs being sent to the server.

Instead, in addition to the minimum cache consistency attributes
also check cache_validity and adjust the GETATTR request accordingly.
