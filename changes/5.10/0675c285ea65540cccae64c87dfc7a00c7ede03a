net: vlan: Fixed signedness in vlan_group_prealloc_vid()

After commit d0186842ec5f ("net: vlan: Avoid using BUG() in
vlan_proto_idx()"), vlan_proto_idx() was changed to return a signed
integer, however one of its called: vlan_group_prealloc_vid() was still
using an unsigned integer for its return value, fix that.
