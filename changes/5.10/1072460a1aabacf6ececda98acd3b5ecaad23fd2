ASoC: Intel: catpt: Correct clock selection for dai trigger

During stream start DSP firmware requires LPCS disabled as that moment in
time is resource heavy. Currently high-clock is selected on start of
second stream onwards while low-clock is re-selected before stream
actually leaves RESUME state i.e. PAUSE_STREAM call. Fix this by always
updating clock before RESUME_STREAM and directly after PAUSE_STREAM.
