vfio/fsl-mc: Add read/write support for fsl-mc devices

The software uses a memory-mapped I/O command interface (MC portals) to
communicate with the MC hardware. This command interface is used to
discover, enumerate, configure and remove DPAA2 objects. The DPAA2
objects use MSIs, so the command interface needs to be emulated
such that the correct MSI is configured in the hardware (the guest
has the virtual MSIs).

This patch is adding read/write support for fsl-mc devices. The mc
commands are emulated by the userspace. The host is just passing
the correct command to the hardware.

Also the current patch limits userspace to write complete
64byte command once and read 64byte response by one ioctl.
