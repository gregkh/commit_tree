drm/i915: panel: Add get_vbt_pwm_freq() helper

Factor the code which checks and drm_dbg_kms-s the VBT PWM frequency
out of get_backlight_max_vbt().

This is a preparation patch for honering the VBT PWM frequency for
devices which use an external PWM controller (devices using
pwm_setup_backlight()).
