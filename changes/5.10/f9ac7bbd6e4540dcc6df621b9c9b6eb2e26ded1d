irqchip/sifive-plic: Fix chip_data access within a hierarchy

The plic driver crashes in plic_irq_unmask() when the interrupt is within a
hierarchy, as it picks the top-level chip_data instead of its local one.

Using irq_data_get_irq_chip_data() instead of irq_get_chip_data() solves
the issue for good.
