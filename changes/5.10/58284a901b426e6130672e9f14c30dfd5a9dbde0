arm64/mm: Validate hotplug range before creating linear mapping

During memory hotplug process, the linear mapping should not be created for
a given memory range if that would fall outside the maximum allowed linear
range. Else it might cause memory corruption in the kernel virtual space.

Maximum linear mapping region is [PAGE_OFFSET..(PAGE_END -1)] accommodating
both its ends but excluding PAGE_END. Max physical range that can be mapped
inside this linear mapping range, must also be derived from its end points.

This ensures that arch_add_memory() validates memory hot add range for its
potential linear mapping requirements, before creating it with
__create_pgd_mapping().
