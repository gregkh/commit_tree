powerpc/process: Fix uninitialised variable error

Clang, and GCC with -Wmaybe-uninitialized, can't see that val is
unused in get_fpexec_mode():

  arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c:1940:7: error: variable 'val' is used
  uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true
		  if (cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_SPE)) {
		      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We know that CPU_FTR_SPE will only be true iff CONFIG_SPE is also
true, but the compiler doesn't.

Avoid it by initialising val to zero.
