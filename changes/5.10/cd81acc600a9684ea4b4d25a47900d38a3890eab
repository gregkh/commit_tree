powerpc/64s/exception: KVM Fix for host DSI being taken in HPT guest MMU context

Commit 2284ffea8f0c ("powerpc/64s/exception: Only test KVM in SRR
interrupts when PR KVM is supported") removed KVM guest tests from
interrupts that do not set HV=1, when PR-KVM is not configured.

This is wrong for HV-KVM HPT guest MMIO emulation case which attempts
to load the faulting instruction word with MSR[DR]=1 and MSR[HV]=1 with
the guest MMU context loaded. This can cause host DSI, DSLB interrupts
which must test for KVM guest. Restore this and add a comment.
