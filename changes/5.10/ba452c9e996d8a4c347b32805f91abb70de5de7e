bpf: Fix bpf_redirect_neigh helper api to support supplying nexthop

Based on the discussion in [0], update the bpf_redirect_neigh() helper to
accept an optional parameter specifying the nexthop information. This makes
it possible to combine bpf_fib_lookup() and bpf_redirect_neigh() without
incurring a duplicate FIB lookup - since the FIB lookup helper will return
the nexthop information even if no neighbour is present, this can simply
be passed on to bpf_redirect_neigh() if bpf_fib_lookup() returns
BPF_FIB_LKUP_RET_NO_NEIGH. Thus fix & extend it before helper API is frozen.
