scsi: be2iscsi: Revert "Fix a theoretical leak in beiscsi_create_eqs()"

My patch caused kernel Oopses and delays in boot.  Revert it.

The problem was that I moved the "mem->dma = paddr;" before the call to
be_fill_queue().  But the first thing that the be_fill_queue() function
does is memset the whole struct to zero which overwrites the assignment.
