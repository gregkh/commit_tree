x86/platform/uv: Remove UV BAU TLB Shootdown Handler

The Broadcast Assist Unit (BAU) TLB shootdown handler is being rewritten
to become the UV BAU APIC driver. It is designed to speed up sending
IPIs to selective CPUs within the system. Remove the current TLB
shutdown handler (tlb_uv.c) file and a couple of kernel hooks in the
interim.
