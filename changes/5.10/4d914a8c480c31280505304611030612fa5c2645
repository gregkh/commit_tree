staging: spmi: hisi-spmi-controller: fix the dev_foo() logic

Right now, driver is printing some messages as:

	[   33.833026] (NULL device *): spmi_read_cmd: id:0 addr:0x17, read value: 00

This is because dev_foo() are not using a device with a name
set. Change the logic for it to print it right.
