btrfs: drop the commit_cycles stuff for data reservations

This was an old wart left over from how we previously did data
reservations.  Before we could have people race in and take a
reservation while we were flushing space, so we needed to make sure we
looped a few times before giving up.  Now that we're using the ticketing
infrastructure we don't have to worry about this and can drop the logic
altogether.
