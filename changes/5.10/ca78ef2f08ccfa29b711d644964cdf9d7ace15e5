powerpc/papr_scm: Fix warning triggered by perf_stats_show()

A warning is reported by the kernel in case perf_stats_show() returns
an error code. The warning is of the form below:

 papr_scm ibm,persistent-memory:ibm,pmemory@44100001:
 	  Failed to query performance stats, Err:-10
 dev_attr_show: perf_stats_show+0x0/0x1c0 [papr_scm] returned bad count
 fill_read_buffer: dev_attr_show+0x0/0xb0 returned bad count

On investigation it looks like that the compiler is silently
truncating the return value of drc_pmem_query_stats() from 'long' to
'int', since the variable used to store the return code 'rc' is an
'int'. This truncated value is then returned back as a 'ssize_t' back
from perf_stats_show() to 'dev_attr_show()' which thinks of it as a
large unsigned number and triggers this warning..

To fix this we update the type of variable 'rc' from 'int' to
'ssize_t' that prevents the compiler from truncating the return value
of drc_pmem_query_stats() and returning correct signed value back from
perf_stats_show().
