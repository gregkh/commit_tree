arm64: pgtable: Ensure dirty bit is preserved across pte_wrprotect()

With hardware dirty bit management, calling pte_wrprotect() on a writable,
dirty PTE will lose the dirty state and return a read-only, clean entry.

Move the logic from ptep_set_wrprotect() into pte_wrprotect() to ensure that
the dirty bit is preserved for writable entries, as this is required for
soft-dirty bit management if we enable it in the future.
