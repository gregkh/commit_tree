smb3.1.1: add new module load parm enable_gcm_256

Add new module load parameter enable_gcm_256. If set, then add
AES-256-GCM (strongest encryption type) to the list of encryption
types requested. Put it in the list as the second choice (since
AES-128-GCM is faster and much more broadly supported by
SMB3 servers).  To make this stronger encryption type, GCM-256,
required (the first and only choice, you would use module parameter
"require_gcm_256."
