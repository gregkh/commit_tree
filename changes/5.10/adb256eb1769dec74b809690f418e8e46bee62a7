net: dsa: allow 8021q uppers while the bridge has vlan_filtering=0

When the bridge has VLAN awareness disabled there isn't any duplication
of functionality, since the bridge does not process VLAN. Don't deny
adding 8021q uppers to DSA switch ports in that case. The switch is
supposed to simply pass traffic leaving the VLAN tag as-is, and the
stack will happily strip the VLAN tag for all 8021q uppers that exist.

We need to ensure that there are no 8021q uppers when the user attempts
to enable bridge vlan_filtering.
