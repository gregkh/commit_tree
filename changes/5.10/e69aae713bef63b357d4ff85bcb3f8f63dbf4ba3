clocksource/drivers/sp804: Prepare for support non-standard register offset

Add two local variables: timer1_base and timer2_base in sp804_of_init(),
to avoid repeatedly calculate the base address of timer2, and make it
easier to recognize timer1. Hope to make the next patch looks more clear.

No functional change.
