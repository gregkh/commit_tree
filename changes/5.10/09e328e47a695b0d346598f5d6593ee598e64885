RDMA/ucma: Fix the locking of ctx->file

ctx->file is changed under the file->mut lock by ucma_migrate_id(), which
is impossible to lock correctly. Instead change ctx->file under the
handler_lock and ctx_table lock and revise all places touching ctx->file
to use this locking when reading ctx->file.
