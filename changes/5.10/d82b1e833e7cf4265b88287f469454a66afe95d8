docs: Add automatic cross-reference for C types

In order to cross-reference C types in the documentation, Sphinx
requires the syntax :c:type:`type_name`, or even :c:type:`struct
type_name <type_name>` in order to have the link text different from the
target text.

Extend automarkup to enable automatic cross-reference of C types by
matching any "struct|union|enum|typedef type_name" expression.
This makes the documentation's plain text cleaner and adds
cross-reference to types without any additional effort by the author.
