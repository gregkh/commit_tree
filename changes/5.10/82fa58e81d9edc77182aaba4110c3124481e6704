iommu/tegra-smmu: Do not use PAGE_SHIFT and PAGE_MASK

PAGE_SHIFT and PAGE_MASK are defined corresponding to the page size
for CPU virtual addresses, which means PAGE_SHIFT could be a number
other than 12, but tegra-smmu maintains fixed 4KB IOVA pages and has
fixed [21:12] bit range for PTE entries.

So this patch replaces all PAGE_SHIFT/PAGE_MASK references with the
macros defined with SMMU_PTE_SHIFT.
