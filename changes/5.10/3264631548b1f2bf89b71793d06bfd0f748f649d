swap: rename SWP_FS to SWAP_FS_OPS to avoid ambiguity

SWP_FS is used to make swap_{read,write}page() go through the filesystem,
and it's only used for swap files over NFS for now.  Otherwise it will
directly submit IO to blockdev according to swapfile extents reported by
filesystems in advance.

As Matthew pointed out [1], SWP_FS naming is somewhat confusing, so let's
rename to SWP_FS_OPS.
