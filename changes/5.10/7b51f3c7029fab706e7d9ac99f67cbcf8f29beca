ASoC: sun8i-codec: Consistently name DAPM widgets and routes

This cleans up the mixer widget names. The AIF1 AD0 Mixer names were
previously wrong -- they do not control the digital side of the ADC. The
DAC mixer widgets were not wrong, but they were verbose and did not
match the naming scheme of the other widgets.

The mixer controls are not renamed because they are exposed to
userspace.
