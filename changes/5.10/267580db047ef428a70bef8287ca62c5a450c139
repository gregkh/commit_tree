seqlock: Unbreak lockdep

seqcount_LOCKNAME_init() needs to be a macro due to the lockdep
annotation in seqcount_init(). Since a macro cannot define another
macro, we need to effectively revert commit: e4e9ab3f9f91 ("seqlock:
Fold seqcount_LOCKNAME_init() definition").

Fixes: e4e9ab3f9f91 ("seqlock: Fold seqcount_LOCKNAME_init() definition")
