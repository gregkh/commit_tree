hinic: add vxlan segmentation and cs offload support

Add NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL and NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL_CSUM features
to support vxlan segmentation and checksum offload. Ipip and ipv6
tunnel packets are regarded as non-tunnel pkt for hw and as for other
type of tunnel pkts, checksum offload is disabled.
