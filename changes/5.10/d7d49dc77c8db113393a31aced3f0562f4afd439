ipv4: nexthop: Reduce allocation size of 'struct nh_group'

The struct looks as follows:

struct nh_group {
	struct nh_group		*spare; /* spare group for removals */
	u16			num_nh;
	bool			mpath;
	bool			fdb_nh;
	bool			has_v4;
	struct nh_grp_entry	nh_entries[];
};

But its offset within 'struct nexthop' is also taken into account to
determine the allocation size.

Instead, use struct_size() to allocate only the required number of
bytes.
