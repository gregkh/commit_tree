drm/vkms: Decouple crc operations from composer

In the vkms_composer.c, some of the functions related to CRC and compose
have interdependence between each other. This patch reworks some
functions inside vkms_composer to make crc and composer computation
decoupled.

This patch is preparation work for making vkms able to support new
features.
