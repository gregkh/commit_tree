btrfs: tree-checker: fix false alert caused by legacy btrfs root item

Commit 259ee7754b67 ("btrfs: tree-checker: Add ROOT_ITEM check")
introduced btrfs root item size check, however btrfs root item has two
versions, the legacy one which just ends before generation_v2 member, is
smaller than current btrfs root item size.

This caused btrfs kernel to reject valid but old tree root leaves.

Fix this problem by also allowing legacy root item, since kernel can
already handle them pretty well and upgrade to newer root item format
when needed.
