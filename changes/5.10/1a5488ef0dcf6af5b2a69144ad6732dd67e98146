KVM: VMX: Invoke NMI handler via indirect call instead of INTn

Rework NMI VM-Exit handling to invoke the kernel handler by function
call instead of INTn.  INTn microcode is relatively expensive, and
aligning the IRQ and NMI handling will make it easier to update KVM
should some newfangled method for invoking the handlers come along.
