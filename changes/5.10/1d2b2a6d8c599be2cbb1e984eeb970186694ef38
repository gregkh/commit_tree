media: vidtv: fix the network ID range

As defined at ETSI TS 101 162, original network IDs up to 0xfebf
are reserved for registration at dvb.org.

Let's use, instead, an original network ID at the range
0xff00-0xffff, as this is for private temporary usage.

As the same value is also used for the network ID,
the range 0xff01-0xffff also fits better, as values
lower than that depend if the network is used for
satellite, terrestrial, cable of CI.

While here, move the TS ID to the bridge code, where it
is used, and change its value, as it was identical to
the value previously used by network ID. While we could
keep the same value, let's change it, just to make easier
to check for the new code while reading it with DVB tools
like dvbinspector.
