sched.h: drop in_ubsan field when UBSAN is in trap mode

in_ubsan field of task_struct is only used in lib/ubsan.c, which in its
turn is used only `ifneq ($(CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP),y)`.

Removing unnecessary field from a task_struct will help preserve the ABI
between vanilla and CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP'ed kernels.  In particular, this
will help enabling bounds sanitizer transparently for Android's GKI.
