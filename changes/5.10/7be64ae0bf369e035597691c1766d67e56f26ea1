power: supply: bq27xxx: add separate flag for capacity inaccurate

bq27000, bq27010 and upcoming bq34z100 have a Capacity Inaccurate flag.
However except this similarity, bq34z100 is quite different than
bq27000/bq27010, so flag BQ27XXX_O_ZERO cannot be reused here.  Add
a new bit flag describing this capability.

No functional change for bq27000 and bq27010.
