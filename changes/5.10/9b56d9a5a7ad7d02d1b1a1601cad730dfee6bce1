net: hns3: delete redundant PCI revision judgement

Fibre device of PCI revision 0x20 don't support autoneg, and the ops
get_autoneg() return AUTONEG_DISABLE so function hns3_nway_reset()
will return earlier than judging PCI revision.

Function hclge_handle_rocee_ras_error() don't need to judge PCI
revision again because its caller hclge_handle_hw_ras_error() has
judged once.
