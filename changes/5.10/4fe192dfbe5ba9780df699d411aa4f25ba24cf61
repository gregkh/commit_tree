rcu-tasks: Shorten per-grace-period sleep for RCU Tasks Trace

The various RCU tasks flavors currently wait 100 milliseconds between each
grace period in order to prevent CPU-bound loops and to favor efficiency
over latency.  However, RCU Tasks Trace needs to have a grace-period
latency of roughly 25 milliseconds, which is completely infeasible given
the 100-millisecond per-grace-period sleep.  This commit therefore reduces
this sleep duration to 5 milliseconds (or one jiffy, whichever is longer)
in kernels built with CONFIG_TASKS_TRACE_RCU_READ_MB=y.
