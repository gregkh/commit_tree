mm/page_isolation: exit early when pageblock is isolated in set_migratetype_isolate()

Right now, if we have two isolations racing on a pageblock that's in the
MOVABLE zone, we would trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE().  Let's just return
directly, simplifying error handling.

The change was introduced in commit 3d680bdf60a5 ("mm/page_isolation: fix
potential warning from user").  As far as I can see, we currently don't
have alloc_contig_range() users that use the ZONE_MOVABLE (anymore), so
it's currently more a cleanup and a preparation for the future than a fix.
