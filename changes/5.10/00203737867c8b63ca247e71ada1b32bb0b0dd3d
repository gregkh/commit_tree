arm64: dts: imx8mm-var-som: fix missing PMIC's interrupt line pull-up

The PMIC's interrupt is level low and should be pulled up.  The PMIC's
device node had pinctrl-0 property but it lacked pinctrl-names which
is required to apply the pin configuration.  The actual problem in DTS
was pointed out by Felix Radensky from Variscite.
