powerpc/8xx: Support 16k hugepages with 4k pages

The 8xx has 4 page sizes: 4k, 16k, 512k and 8M

4k and 16k can be selected at build time as standard page sizes,
and 512k and 8M are hugepages.

When 4k standard pages are selected, 16k pages are not available.

Allow 16k pages as hugepages when 4k pages are used.

To allow that, implement arch_make_huge_pte() which receives
the necessary arguments to allow setting the PTE in accordance
with the page size:
- 512 k pages must have _PAGE_HUGE and _PAGE_SPS. They are set
by pte_mkhuge(). arch_make_huge_pte() does nothing.
- 16 k pages must have only _PAGE_SPS. arch_make_huge_pte() clears
_PAGE_HUGE.
