btrfs: remove btree_readpage

There is no way for this function to be called as ->readpage() since
it's called from
generic_file_buffered_read/filemap_fault/do_read_cache_page/readhead
code. BTRFS doesn't utilize the first 3 for the btree inode and
implements it's owon readhead mechanism. So simply remove the function.
