drm/panfrost: move devfreq_init()/fini() in device

Later we will introduce devfreq probing regulator if they
are present. As regulator should be probe only one time we
need to get this logic in the device_init().

panfrost_device is already taking care of devfreq_resume()
and devfreq_suspend(), so it's not totally illogic to move
the devfreq_init() and devfreq_fini() here.
