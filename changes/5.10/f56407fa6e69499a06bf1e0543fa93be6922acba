bpf: Remove bpf_lsm_file_mprotect from sleepable list.

Technically the bpf programs can sleep while attached to bpf_lsm_file_mprotect,
but such programs need to access user memory. So they're in might_fault()
category. Which means they cannot be called from file_mprotect lsm hook that
takes write lock on mm->mmap_lock.
Adjust the test accordingly.

Also add might_fault() to __bpf_prog_enter_sleepable() to catch such deadlocks early.
