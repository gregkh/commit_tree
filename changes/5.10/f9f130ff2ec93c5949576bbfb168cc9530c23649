powerpc/numa: Detect support for coregroup

Add support for grouping cores based on the device-tree classification.
- The last domain in the associativity domains always refers to the
core.
- If primary reference domain happens to be the penultimate domain in
the associativity domains device-tree property, then there are no
coregroups. However if its not a penultimate domain, then there are
coregroups. There can be more than one coregroup. For now we would be
interested in the last or the smallest coregroups, i.e one sub-group
per DIE.

Currently there are no firmwares that are exposing this grouping. Hence
allow the basis for grouping to be abstract.  Once the firmware starts
using this grouping, code would be added to detect the type of grouping
and adjust the sd domain flags accordingly.
