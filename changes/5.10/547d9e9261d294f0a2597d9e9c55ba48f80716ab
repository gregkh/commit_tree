pwm: lpss: Remove suspend/resume handlers

PWM controller drivers should not restore the PWM state on resume. The
convention is that PWM consumers do this by calling pwm_apply_state(),
so that it can be done at the exact moment when the consumer needs
the state to be stored, avoiding e.g. backlight flickering.

The only in kernel consumers of the pwm-lpss code, the i915 driver
and the pwm-class sysfs interface code both correctly restore the
state on resume, so there is no need to do this in the pwm-lpss code.

More-over the removed resume handler is buggy, since it blindly
restores the ctrl-register contents without setting the update
bit, which is necessary to get the controller to actually use/apply
the restored base-unit and on-time-div values.
