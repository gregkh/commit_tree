kvm: arm64: Remove hyp_adr/ldr_this_cpu

The hyp_adr/ldr_this_cpu helpers were introduced for use in hyp code
because they always needed to use TPIDR_EL2 for base, while
adr/ldr_this_cpu from kernel proper would select between TPIDR_EL2 and
_EL1 based on VHE/nVHE.

Simplify this now that the hyp mode case can be handled using the
__KVM_VHE/NVHE_HYPERVISOR__ macros.
