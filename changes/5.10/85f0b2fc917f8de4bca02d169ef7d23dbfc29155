arm64: kexec_file: Fix sparse warning

Sparse gets cross about us returning 0 from image_load(), which has a
return type of 'void *':

>> arch/arm64/kernel/kexec_image.c:130:16: sparse: sparse: Using plain integer as NULL pointer

Return NULL instead, as we don't use the return value for anything if it
does not indicate an error.
