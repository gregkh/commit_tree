bpf: Add d_path helper

Adding d_path helper function that returns full path for
given 'struct path' object, which needs to be the kernel
BTF 'path' object. The path is returned in buffer provided
'buf' of size 'sz' and is zero terminated.

  bpf_d_path(&file->f_path, buf, size);

The helper calls directly d_path function, so there's only
limited set of function it can be called from. Adding just
very modest set for the start.

Updating also bpf.h tools uapi header and adding 'path' to
bpf_helpers_doc.py script.
