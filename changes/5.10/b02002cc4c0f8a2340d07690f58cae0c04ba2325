s390/pci: Implement ioremap_wc/prot() with MIO

With our current support for the new MIO PCI instructions, write
combining/write back MMIO memory can be obtained via the pci_iomap_wc()
and pci_iomap_wc_range() functions.
This is achieved by using the write back address for a specific bar
as provided in clp_store_query_pci_fn()

These functions are however not widely used and instead drivers often
rely on ioremap_wc() and ioremap_prot(), which on other platforms enable
write combining using a PTE flag set through the pgrprot value.

While we do not have a write combining flag in the low order flag bits
of the PTE like x86_64 does, with MIO support, there is a write back bit
in the physical address (bit 1 on z15) and thus also the PTE.
Which bit is used to toggle write back and whether it is available at
all, is however not fixed in the architecture. Instead we get this
information from the CLP Store Logical Processor Characteristics for PCI
command. When the write back bit is not provided we fall back to the
existing behavior.
