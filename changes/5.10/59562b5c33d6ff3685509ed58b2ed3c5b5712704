powerpc/perf: consolidate GPCI hcall structs into asm/hvcall.h

The H_GetPerformanceCounterInfo (GPCI) hypercall input/output structs are
useful to modules outside of perf/, so move them into asm/hvcall.h to live
alongside the other powerpc hypercall structs.

Leave the perf-specific GPCI stuff in perf/hv-gpci.h.
