selftests/bpf: Add tests for BPF_F_PRESERVE_ELEMS

Add tests for perf event array with and without BPF_F_PRESERVE_ELEMS.

Add a perf event to array via fd mfd. Without BPF_F_PRESERVE_ELEMS, the
perf event is removed when mfd is closed. With BPF_F_PRESERVE_ELEMS, the
perf event is removed when the map is freed.
