firmware: arm_sdei: Common block for failing path in sdei_event_create()

There are multiple calls of kfree(event) in the failing path of
sdei_event_create() to free the SDEI event. It means we need to
call it again when adding more code in the failing path. It's
prone to miss doing that and introduce memory leakage.

This introduces common block for failing path in sdei_event_create()
to resolve the issue. This shouldn't cause functional changes.
