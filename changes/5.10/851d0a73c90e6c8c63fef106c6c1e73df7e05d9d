bridge: Fix a deadlock when enabling multicast snooping

When enabling multicast snooping, bridge module deadlocks on multicast_lock
if 1) IPv6 is enabled, and 2) there is an existing querier on the same L2
network.

The deadlock was caused by the following sequence: While holding the lock,
br_multicast_open calls br_multicast_join_snoopers, which eventually causes
IP stack to (attempt to) send out a Listener Report (in igmp6_join_group).
Since the destination Ethernet address is a multicast address, br_dev_xmit
feeds the packet back to the bridge via br_multicast_rcv, which in turn
calls br_multicast_add_group, which then deadlocks on multicast_lock.

The fix is to move the call br_multicast_join_snoopers outside of the
critical section. This works since br_multicast_join_snoopers only deals
with IP and does not modify any multicast data structures of the bridge,
so there's no need to hold the lock.

Steps to reproduce:
1. sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.force_mld_version=1
2. have another querier
3. ip link set dev bridge type bridge mcast_snooping 0 && \
   ip link set dev bridge type bridge mcast_snooping 1 < deadlock >
