x86/boot/compressed/64: Add page-fault handler

Install a page-fault handler to add an identity mapping to addresses
not yet mapped. Also do some checking whether the error code is sane.

This makes non SEV-ES machines use the exception handling
infrastructure in the pre-decompressions boot code too, making it less
likely to break in the future.
