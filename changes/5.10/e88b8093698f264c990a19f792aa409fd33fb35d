KVM: x86/mmu: Track write/user faults using bools

Use bools to track write and user faults throughout the page fault paths
and down into mmu_set_spte().  The actual usage is purely boolean, but
that's not obvious without digging into all paths as the current code
uses a mix of bools (TDP and try_async_pf) and ints (shadow paging and
mmu_set_spte()).

No true functional change intended (although the pgprintk() will now
print 0/1 instead of 0/PFERR_WRITE_MASK).
