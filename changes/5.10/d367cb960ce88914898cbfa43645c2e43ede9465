cifs: remove bogus debug code

The "end" pointer is either NULL or it points to the next byte to parse.
If there isn't a next byte then dereferencing "end" is an off-by-one out
of bounds error.  And, of course, if it's NULL that leads to an Oops.
Printing "*end" doesn't seem very useful so let's delete this code.

Also for the last debug statement, I noticed that it should be printing
"sequence_end" instead of "end" so fix that as well.
