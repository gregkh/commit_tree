ASoC: Intel: catpt: Wake up device before configuring SSP port

catpt_dai_pcm_new() invoked during new PCM runtime creation configures
SSP by sending IPC to DSP firmware. For that to succeed device needs to
be up and running. While components default probing behavior -
snd_soc_catpt causing machine board module to load just after it - needs
no changes, machine board's module may be unloaded and re-loaded at a
different time e.g.: when catpt is already asleep.

Wake device explicitly in catpt_dai_pcm_new() to ensure communication is
established before sending any IPCs, enabling those advanced scenarios
in the process.
