spi: spi-geni-qcom: Don't program CS_TOGGLE again and again

We always toggle the chip select manually in spi-geni-qcom so that we
can properly implement the Linux API.  There's no reason to program
this to the hardware on every transfer.  Program it once at init and
be done with it.

This saves some part of a microsecond of overhead on each transfer.
While not really noticeable on any real world benchmarks, we might as
well save the time.
