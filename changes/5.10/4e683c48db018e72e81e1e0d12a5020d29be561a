nvmet: handle keep-alive timer when kato is modified by a set features cmd

A user may modify the kato by a set features cmd.  To properly deal
with races or a kato value of 0 (no keep alive enabled) change
nvmet_set_feat_kato to first disable the timer, then set the value
and then re-enable the timer.
