RISC-V: Add PE/COFF header for EFI stub

Linux kernel Image can appear as an EFI application With appropriate
PE/COFF header fields in the beginning of the Image header. An EFI
application loader can directly load a Linux kernel Image and an EFI
stub residing in kernel can boot Linux kernel directly.

Add the necessary PE/COFF header.

[ardb: - use C prefix for c.li to ensure the expected opcode is emitted
       - align all image sections according to PE/COFF section alignment ]
