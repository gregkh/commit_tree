net/mlx5e: Move the TLS resync check out of the function

Before this patch, mlx5e_ktls_tx_handle_resync_dump_comp checked for
resync_dump_frag_page. It happened for all WQEs without an SKB,
including padding WQEs, and required a function call. Normally, padding
WQEs happen more often than TLS resyncs. Take this check out of the
function and put it to an inline function to save a call on all padding
WQEs.
