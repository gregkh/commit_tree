Revert "usb: musb: convert to devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname"

This reverts commit 2d30e408a2a6b3443d3232593e3d472584a3e9f8.

On Beaglebone Black, where each interface has 2 children:

    musb-dsps 47401c00.usb: can't request region for resource [mem 0x47401800-0x474019ff]
    musb-hdrc musb-hdrc.1: musb_init_controller failed with status -16
    musb-hdrc: probe of musb-hdrc.1 failed with error -16
    musb-dsps 47401400.usb: can't request region for resource [mem 0x47401000-0x474011ff]
    musb-hdrc musb-hdrc.0: musb_init_controller failed with status -16
    musb-hdrc: probe of musb-hdrc.0 failed with error -16

Before, devm_ioremap_resource() was called on "dev" ("musb-hdrc.0" or
"musb-hdrc.1"), after it is called on "&pdev->dev" ("47401400.usb" or
"47401c00.usb"), leading to a duplicate region request, which fails.
