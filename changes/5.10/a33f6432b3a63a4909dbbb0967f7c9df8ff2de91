ceph: encode inodes' parent/d_name in cap reconnect message

Since nautilus, MDS tracks dirfrags whose child inodes have caps in open
file table. When MDS recovers, it prefetches all of these dirfrags. This
avoids using backtrace to load inodes. But dirfrags prefetch may load
lots of useless inodes into cache, and make MDS run out of memory.

Recent MDS adds an option that disables dirfrags prefetch. When dirfrags
prefetch is disabled. Recovering MDS only prefetches corresponding dir
inodes. Including inodes' parent/d_name in cap reconnect message can
help MDS to load inodes into its cache.
