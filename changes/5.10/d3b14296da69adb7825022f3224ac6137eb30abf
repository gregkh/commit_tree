rtc: rx8010: don't modify the global rtc ops

The way the driver is implemented is buggy for the (admittedly unlikely)
use case where there are two RTCs with one having an interrupt configured
and the second not. This is caused by the fact that we use a global
rtc_class_ops struct which we modify depending on whether the irq number
is present or not.

Fix it by using two const ops structs with and without alarm operations.
While at it: not being able to request a configured interrupt is an error
so don't ignore it and bail out of probe().
