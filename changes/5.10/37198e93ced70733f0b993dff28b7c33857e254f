net: mptcp: make DACK4/DACK8 usage consistent among all subflows

using packetdrill it's possible to observe the same MPTCP DSN being acked
by different subflows with DACK4 and DACK8. This is in contrast with what
specified in RFC8684 ยง3.3.2: if an MPTCP endpoint transmits a 64-bit wide
DSN, it MUST be acknowledged with a 64-bit wide DACK. Fix 'use_64bit_ack'
variable to make it a property of MPTCP sockets, not TCP subflows.

Fixes: a0c1d0eafd1e ("mptcp: Use 32-bit DATA_ACK when possible")
