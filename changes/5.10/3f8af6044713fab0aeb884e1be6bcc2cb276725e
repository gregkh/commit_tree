scsi: ufs: Add some debug information to ufshcd_print_host_state()

Information about the last interrupt status and timestamp is helpful when
debugging system stability issues (IRQ starvation, for instance). Add this
information to ufshcd_print_host_state() output.

In addition, UFS device information such as model name and firmware version
also comes in handy during debugging. This is printed as well.
