bdi: replace BDI_CAP_STABLE_WRITES with a queue and a sb flag

The BDI_CAP_STABLE_WRITES is one of the few bits of information in the
backing_dev_info shared between the block drivers and the writeback code.
To help untangling the dependency replace it with a queue flag and a
superblock flag derived from it.  This also helps with the case of e.g.
a file system requiring stable writes due to its own checksumming, but
not forcing it on other users of the block device like the swap code.

One downside is that we an't support the stable_pages_required bdi
attribute in sysfs anymore.  It is replaced with a queue attribute which
also is writable for easier testing.
