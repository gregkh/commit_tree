ath11k: Add support spectral scan for IPQ6018

IPQ6018 supported with 4 bytes FFT BIN size. so supported 4 bytes
parsing logic in FFT report process. since spectral_fft_sz is
configured as zero in hw_params, spectral is not supported in
QCA6390 platform.

Tested-on: IPQ6018 WLAN.HK.2.1.0.1-01228-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
