net/smc: fix suppressed return code

The patch that repaired the invalid return code in smcd_new_buf_create()
missed to take care of errno ENOSPC which has a special meaning that no
more DMBEs can be registered on the device. Fix that by keeping this
errno value during the translation of the return code.
