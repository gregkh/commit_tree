clk: ingenic: Respect CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT in .round_rate

Clocks that don't have a divider are in our case all marked with the
CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag. In this case, the .round_rate implementation
should modify the value pointed to by parent_rate, in order to propagate
the rate change to the parent, as explained in the documentation of
clk_set_rate().
