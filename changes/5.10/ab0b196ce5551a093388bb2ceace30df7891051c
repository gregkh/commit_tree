io_uring: fix overlapped memcpy in io_req_map_rw()

When io_req_map_rw() is called from io_rw_prep_async(), it memcpy()
iorw->iter into itself. Even though it doesn't lead to an error, such a
memcpy()'s aliasing rules violation is considered to be a bad practise.

Inline io_req_map_rw() into io_rw_prep_async(). We don't really need any
remapping there, so it's much simpler than the generic implementation.
