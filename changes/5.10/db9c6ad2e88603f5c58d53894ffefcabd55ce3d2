arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Update the audio codec compatible

The audio codec in the A64 has some differences from the A33 codec, so
it needs its own compatible. Since the two codecs are similar, the A33
codec compatible is kept as a fallback.

Using the correct compatible fixes a channel inversion issue and cleans
up some DAPM widgets that are no longer used.
