drm/bridge: tc358762: Add basic driver for Toshiba TC358762 DSI-to-DPI bridge

Add very basic driver for Toshiba TC358762 DSI-to-DPI bridge, derived
from tc358764 driver and panel-raspberrypi-touchscreen. This driver is
meant to replace the panel-raspberrypi-touchscreen too, as the bridge
connection can be described in DT too.
