ipv4: nexthop: Correctly update nexthop group when removing a nexthop

Each nexthop group contains an indication if it has IPv4 nexthops
('has_v4'). Its purpose is to prevent IPv6 routes from using groups with
IPv4 nexthops.

However, the indication is not updated when a nexthop is removed. This
results in the kernel wrongly rejecting IPv6 routes from pointing to
groups that only contain IPv6 nexthops. Example:

# ip nexthop replace id 1 via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy10
# ip nexthop replace id 2 via 2001:db8:1::2 dev dummy10
# ip nexthop replace id 10 group 1/2
# ip nexthop del id 1
# ip route replace 2001:db8:10::/64 nhid 10
Error: IPv6 routes can not use an IPv4 nexthop.

Solve this by updating the indication according to the new set of
member nexthops.
