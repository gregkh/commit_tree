gfs2: Only access gl_delete for iopen glocks

Only initialize gl_delete for iopen glocks, but more importantly, only access
it for iopen glocks in flush_delete_work: flush_delete_work is called for
different types of glocks including rgrp glocks, and those use gl_vm which is
in a union with gl_delete.  Without this fix, we'll end up clobbering gl_vm,
which results in general memory corruption.
