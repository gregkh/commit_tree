selinux: Refactor selinuxfs directory populating functions

Make sel_make_bools and sel_make_classes take the specific elements of
selinux_fs_info that they need rather than the entire struct.

This will allow a future patch to pass temporary elements that are not in
the selinux_fs_info struct to these functions so that the original elements
can be preserved until we are ready to perform the switch over.
