RDMA/rxe: Move the definitions for rxe_av.network_type to uAPI

RXE was wrongly using an internal kernel enum as part of its uAPI, split
this out into a dedicated uAPI enum just for RXE. It only uses the IPv4
and IPv6 values.

This was exposed by changing the internal kernel enum definition which
broke RXE.
