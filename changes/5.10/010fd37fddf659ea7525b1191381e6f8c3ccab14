KVM: LAPIC: Reduce world switch latency caused by timer_advance_ns

All the checks in lapic_timer_int_injected(), __kvm_wait_lapic_expire(), and
these function calls waste cpu cycles when the timer mode is not tscdeadline.
We can observe ~1.3% world switch time overhead by kvm-unit-tests/vmexit.flat
vmcall testing on AMD server. This patch reduces the world switch latency
caused by timer_advance_ns feature when the timer mode is not tscdeadline by
simpling move the check against apic->lapic_timer.expired_tscdeadline much
earlier.
