docs: basics.rst: avoid duplicated C function declaration

pci_device_id is already documented at pci.rst:

	./Documentation/driver-api/basics.rst: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined in 'PCI/pci'.
	Declaration is 'pci_device_id'.

The kstrtol and kstrtoul are already at kernel-api:

	./Documentation/driver-api/basics.rst: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined in 'core-api/kernel-api'.
	Declaration is 'kstrtoul'.
	./Documentation/driver-api/basics.rst: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined in 'core-api/kernel-api'.
	Declaration is 'kstrtol'.

And the printk is already defined at printk-basics:

	./Documentation/driver-api/basics.rst: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined in 'core-api/printk-basics'.
	Declaration is 'printk'.

So, exclude those identifiers from basirs.rst.
