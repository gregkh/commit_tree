x86/microcode/intel: Check patch signature before saving microcode for early loading

Currently, scan_microcode() leverages microcode_matches() to check
if the microcode matches the CPU by comparing the family and model.
However, the processor stepping and flags of the microcode signature
should also be considered when saving a microcode patch for early
update.

Use find_matching_signature() in scan_microcode() and get rid of the
now-unused microcode_matches() which is a good cleanup in itself.

Complete the verification of the patch being saved for early loading in
save_microcode_patch() directly. This needs to be done there too because
save_mc_for_early() will call save_microcode_patch() too.

The second reason why this needs to be done is because the loader still
tries to support, at least hypothetically, mixed-steppings systems and
thus adds all patches to the cache that belong to the same CPU model
albeit with different steppings.

For example:

  microcode: CPU: sig=0x906ec, pf=0x2, rev=0xd6
  microcode: mc_saved[0]: sig=0x906e9, pf=0x2a, rev=0xd6, total size=0x19400, date = 2020-04-23
  microcode: mc_saved[1]: sig=0x906ea, pf=0x22, rev=0xd6, total size=0x19000, date = 2020-04-27
  microcode: mc_saved[2]: sig=0x906eb, pf=0x2, rev=0xd6, total size=0x19400, date = 2020-04-23
  microcode: mc_saved[3]: sig=0x906ec, pf=0x22, rev=0xd6, total size=0x19000, date = 2020-04-27
  microcode: mc_saved[4]: sig=0x906ed, pf=0x22, rev=0xd6, total size=0x19400, date = 2020-04-23

The patch which is being saved for early loading, however, can only be
the one which fits the CPU this runs on so do the signature verification
before saving.

 [ bp: Do signature verification in save_microcode_patch()
       and rewrite commit message. ]
