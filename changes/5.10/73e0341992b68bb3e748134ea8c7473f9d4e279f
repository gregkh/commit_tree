gpiolib: cdev: support edge detection for uAPI v2

Add support for edge detection to lines requested using
GPIO_V2_GET_LINE_IOCTL.

The edge_detector implementation is based on the v1 lineevent
implementation.  Unlike the v1 implementation, an overflow of the event
buffer results in discarding older events, rather than the most
recent, so the final event in a burst will correspond to the current
state of the line.
