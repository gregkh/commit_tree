arm64: dts: ti: k3-j7200-common-proc-board: Add USB support

The board uses lane 3 of SERDES for USB. Set the mux
accordingly.

The USB controller and EVM supports super-speed for USB0
on the Type-C port. However, the SERDES has a limitation
that upto 2 protocols can be used at a time. The SERDES is
wired for PCIe, QSGMII and USB super-speed. It has been
chosen to use PCI2 and QSGMII as default. So restrict
USB0 to high-speed mode.
