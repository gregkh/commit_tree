arm64: dts: qcom: Add support for Xiaomi Poco F1 (Beryllium)

Add initial dts support for Xiaomi Poco F1 (Beryllium).

This initial support is based on upstream Dragonboard 845c
(sdm845) device. With this dts, Beryllium boots AOSP up to
ADB shell over USB-C.

Supported functionality includes UFS, USB-C (peripheral),
microSD card and Vol+/Vol-/power keys. Bluetooth should work
too but couldn't be verified from adb command line, it is
verified when enabled from UI with few WIP display patches.

Just like initial db845c support, initializing the SMMU is
clearing the mapping used for the splash screen framebuffer,
which causes the device to hang during boot and recovery
needs a hard power reset. This can be worked around using:

    fastboot oem select-display-panel none

To switch ON the display back run:

    fastboot oem select-display-panel

But this only works on Beryllium devices running bootloader
version BOOT.XF.2.0-00369-SDM845LZB-1 that shipped with
Android-9 based release. Newer bootloader version do not
support switching OFF the display panel at all.
