dpaa_eth: update the buffer layout for non-A050385 erratum scenarios

Impose a larger RX private data area only when the A050385 erratum is
present on the hardware. A smaller buffer size is sufficient in all
other scenarios. This enables a wider range of linear Jumbo frame
sizes in non-erratum scenarios, instead of turning to multi
buffer Scatter/Gather frames. The maximum linear frame size is
increased by 128 bytes for non-erratum arm64 platforms.

Cleanup the hardware annotations header defines in the process.
