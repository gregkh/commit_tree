module: statically initialize init section freeing data

Corentin hit the following workqueue warning when running with
CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS:

  WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 147 at kernel/workqueue.c:1473 __queue_work+0x3b8/0x3d0

  Hardware name: Pine H64 model A (DT)
  pc : __queue_work+0x3b8/0x3d0

I wasn't able to reproduce on x86 or rpi 3b+.

This is

  WARN_ON(!list_empty(&work->entry))

from __queue_work(), and it happens because the init_free_wq work item
isn't initialized in time for a crypto test that requests the gcm
module.  Some crypto tests were recently moved earlier in boot as
explained in commit c4741b230597 ("crypto: run initcalls for generic
implementations earlier"), which went into mainline less than two weeks
before the Fixes commit.

Avoid the warning by statically initializing init_free_wq and the
corresponding llist.
