drm/amdgpu: refine create and release logic of hive info

Change to dynamically create and release hive info object,
which help driver support more hives in the future.

v2:
Change to save hive object pointer in adev, to avoid locking
xgmi_mutex every time when calling amdgpu_get_xgmi_hive.

v3:
1. Change type of hive object pointer in adev from void* to
amdgpu_hive_info*.
2. remove unnecessary variable initialization.
