media: venus: Fix reported frame intervals

On dragonboard-410c (apq8016) with HFI_VERSION_1XX, the reported
framerate is in unit of 1/65535 fps (for fine grained control).
So the current reported supported frame intervals is wrong (max
is 1/65535 fps), leading to encoding issues or format negotiation
failures with gstreamer.

Fix that by setting the framerate denominator to coherent value
based on the the framerate factor.

The factor is not always the same, e.g. with db820c (apq8096) HFI
reports framerate in fps unit. So only apply that for HFI_VERSION_1XX.
