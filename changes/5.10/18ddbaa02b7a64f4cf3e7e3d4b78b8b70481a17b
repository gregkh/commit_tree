arm64: mte: ptrace: Add PTRACE_{PEEK,POKE}MTETAGS support

Add support for bulk setting/getting of the MTE tags in a tracee's
address space at 'addr' in the ptrace() syscall prototype. 'data' points
to a struct iovec in the tracer's address space with iov_base
representing the address of a tracer's buffer of length iov_len. The
tags to be copied to/from the tracer's buffer are stored as one tag per
byte.

On successfully copying at least one tag, ptrace() returns 0 and updates
the tracer's iov_len with the number of tags copied. In case of error,
either -EIO or -EFAULT is returned, trying to follow the ptrace() man
page.

Note that the tag copying functions are not performance critical,
therefore they lack optimisations found in typical memory copy routines.
