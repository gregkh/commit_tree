pinctrl: actions: pinctrl-owl: Constify owl_pinctrl_ops and owl_pinmux_ops

The only usage of owl_pinctrl_ops and owl_pinmux_ops is to assign their
addresses to the pctlops and the pmxops fields in the pinctrl_desc struct,
which are const pointers. Make them const to allow the compiler to put them
in read-only memory.
