kdb: Fix pager search for multi-line strings

Currently using forward search doesn't handle multi-line strings correctly.
The search routine replaces line breaks with \0 during the search and, for
regular searches ("help | grep Common\n"), there is code after the line
has been discarded or printed to replace the break character.

However during a pager search ("help\n" followed by "/Common\n") when the
string is matched we will immediately return to normal output and the code
that should restore the \n becomes unreachable. Fix this by restoring the
replaced character when we disable the search mode and update the comment
accordingly.
