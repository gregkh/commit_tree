btrfs: skip devices without magic signature when mounting

Many things can happen after the device is scanned and before the device
is mounted.  One such thing is losing the BTRFS_MAGIC on the device.
If it happens we still won't free that device from the memory and cause
the userland confusion.

For example: As the BTRFS_IOC_DEV_INFO still carries the device path
which does not have the BTRFS_MAGIC, 'btrfs fi show' still lists
device which does not belong to the filesystem anymore:

  $ mkfs.btrfs -fq -draid1 -mraid1 /dev/sda /dev/sdb
  $ wipefs -a /dev/sdb
  # /dev/sdb does not contain magic signature
  $ mount -o degraded /dev/sda /btrfs
  $ btrfs fi show -m
  Label: none  uuid: 470ec6fb-646b-4464-b3cb-df1b26c527bd
	  Total devices 2 FS bytes used 128.00KiB
	  devid    1 size 3.00GiB used 571.19MiB path /dev/sda
	  devid    2 size 3.00GiB used 571.19MiB path /dev/sdb

We need to distinguish the missing signature and invalid superblock, so
add a specific error code ENODATA for that. This also fixes failure of
fstest btrfs/198.
