scripts: get_abi.pl: cleanup ABI cross-reference logic

Right now, the cross-references are generated on a single
step, when doing ReST output.

While this is nice optimization, it prevents auto-creating
cross-references for ABI symbols.

So, split it into a separate logic.

While here, turn on Perl warnings, as it helps to debug
problems inside the script.
