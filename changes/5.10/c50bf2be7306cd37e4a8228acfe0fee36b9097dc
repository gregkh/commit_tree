devlink: add .trap_group_action_set() callback

Add a new devlink callback, .trap_group_action_set(), which can be used
by device drivers which do not support controlling the action (drop,
trap) on each trap but rather on the entire group trap.
If this new callback is populated, it will take precedence over the
.trap_action_set() callback when the user requests a change of all the
traps in a group.
