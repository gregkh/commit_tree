MIPS: cpu-probe: move fpu probing/handling into its own file

cpu-probe.c has grown when supporting more and more CPUs and there
are use cases where probing for all the CPUs isn't useful like
running on a R3k system. But still the fpu handling is nearly
the same. For sharing put the fpu code into it's own file.
