PCI: mvebu: Fix duplicate resource requests

With commit 669cbc708122 ("PCI: Move DT resource setup into
devm_pci_alloc_host_bridge()"), the DT 'ranges' is parsed and populated
into resources when the host bridge is allocated. The resources are
requested as well, but that happens a second time for the mvebu driver in
mvebu_pcie_parse_request_resources(). We should only be requesting the
additional resources added in mvebu_pcie_parse_request_resources().  These
are not added by default because they use custom properties rather than
standard DT address translation.

Also, the bus ranges was also populated by default, so we can remove it
from mvebu_pci_host_probe().
