panic: dump registers on panic_on_warn

Currently we print stack and registers for ordinary warnings but we do not
for panic_on_warn which looks as oversight - panic() will reboot the
machine but won't print registers.

This moves printing of registers and modules earlier.

This does not move the stack dumping as panic() dumps it.
