hwmon: (amd_energy) optimize accumulation interval

On a system with course grain resolution of energy unit (milli J) the
accumulation thread can be executed less frequently than on the system
with fine grain resolution(micro J).

This patch sets the accumulation thread interval to an optimum value
calculated based on the (energy unit) resolution supported by the
hardware (assuming a peak wattage of 240W).
