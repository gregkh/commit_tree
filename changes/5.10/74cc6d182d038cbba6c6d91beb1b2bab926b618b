udp_tunnel: add the ability to share port tables

Unfortunately recent Intel NIC designs share the UDP port table
across netdevs. So far the UDP tunnel port state was maintained
per netdev, we need to extend that to cater to Intel NICs.

Expect NICs to allocate the info structure dynamically and link
to the state from there. All the shared NICs will record port
offload information in the one instance of the table so we need
to make sure that the use count can accommodate larger numbers.
