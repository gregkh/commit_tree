tools/bootconfig: Align the bootconfig applied initrd image size to 4

Align the bootconfig applied initrd image size to 4. To fill the gap,
the bootconfig command uses null characters in between the bootconfig
data and the footer. This will expands the footer size but don't change
the checksum.
Thus the block image of the initrd file with bootconfig is as follows.

[initrd][bootconfig][(pad)][size][csum]["#BOOTCONFIG\n"]
