extcon: ptn5150: Deduplicate parts of dev_err_probe()

dev_err_probe() is designed to be used like

	return dev_err_probe(dev, ret, "Error message\n");

Hence no need to have a separate return statement. Besides that
dev_err_probe() prints already returned error code, no need to repeat
that either.
