MIPS: Loongson64: Select SMP in Kconfig to avoid build error

In the current code, CONFIG_SMP can be set as N by user on the Loongson
platform, then there exists the following build error under !CONFIG_SMP:

  CC      arch/mips/kernel/asm-offsets.s

cc1: some warnings being treated as errors
scripts/Makefile.build:117: recipe for target 'arch/mips/kernel/asm-offsets.s' failed

Select SMP in Kconfig to avoid the above build error and then remove
CONFIG_SMP=y in loongson3_defconfig.
