drm/amdgpu: break driver init process when it's bad GPU(v5)

When retrieving bad gpu tag from eeprom, GPU init should
fail as the GPU needs to be retired for further check.

v2: Fix spelling typo, correct the condition to detect
    bad gpu tag and refine error message.

v3: Refine function argument name.

v4: Fix missing check of returning value of i2c
    initialization error case.

v5: Use dev_err to print PCI information in dmesg instead
    of DRM_ERROR.
