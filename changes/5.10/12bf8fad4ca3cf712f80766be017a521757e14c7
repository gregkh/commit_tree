mac80211: initialize last_rate for S1G STAs

last_rate is initialized to zero by sta_info_alloc(), but
this indicates legacy bitrate for the last TX rate (and
invalid for the last RX rate). To avoid a warning when
decoding the last rate as legacy (before a data frame
has been sent), initialize them as S1G MCS.

[rename to ieee80211_s1g_sta_rate_init(), seems more appropriate]
