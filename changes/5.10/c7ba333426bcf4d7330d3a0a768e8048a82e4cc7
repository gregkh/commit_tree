scripts: get_abi.pl: detect duplicated ABI definitions

The ABI should define only once each What. The current script
logic assumes that.

However, that's not the case, currently: there are several
symbols with a generic definition, and per-driver ones.

Better handle such cases, by preserving the cross-references
with the files that define them, but also track such
cases, producing warnings, as they should be fixed.
