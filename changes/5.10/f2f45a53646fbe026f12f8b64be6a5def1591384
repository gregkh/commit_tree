iio: event: use short-hand variable in iio_device_{un}register_eventset functions

With the recent 'iio_dev_opaque' variable name, these two functions are
looking a bit ugly.

This change uses an 'ev_int' variable for the
iio_device_{un}register_eventset functions to make the code a little easier
to read.
