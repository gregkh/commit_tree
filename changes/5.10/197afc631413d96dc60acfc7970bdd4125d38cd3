libbpf: Don't attempt to load unused subprog as an entry-point BPF program

If BPF code contains unused BPF subprogram and there are no other subprogram
calls (which can realistically happen in real-world applications given
sufficiently smart Clang code optimizations), libbpf will erroneously assume
that subprograms are entry-point programs and will attempt to load them with
UNSPEC program type.

Fix by not relying on subcall instructions and rather detect it based on the
structure of BPF object's sections.
