net: stmmac: delete the eee_ctrl_timer after napi disabled

There have chance to re-enable the eee_ctrl_timer and fire the timer
in napi callback after delete the timer in .stmmac_release(), which
introduces to access eee registers in the timer function after clocks
are disabled then causes system hang. Found this issue when do
suspend/resume and reboot stress test.

It is safe to delete the timer after napi disabled and disable lpi mode.
