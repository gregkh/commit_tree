drm/i915: Reduce locking around i915_active_acquire_preallocate_barrier()

As the conversion between idle-barrier and full i915_active_fence is
already serialised by explicit memory barriers, we can reduce the
spinlock in i915_active_acquire_preallocate_barrier() for finding an
idle-barrier to reuse to an RCU read lock to ensure the fence remains
valid, only taking the spinlock for the update of the rbtree itself.
