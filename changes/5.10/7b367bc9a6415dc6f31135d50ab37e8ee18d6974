KVM: x86/mmu: Return -EIO if page fault returns RET_PF_INVALID

Exit to userspace with an error if the MMU is buggy and returns
RET_PF_INVALID when servicing a page fault.  This will allow a future
patch to invert the emulation path, i.e. emulate only on RET_PF_EMULATE
instead of emulating on anything but RET_PF_RETRY.  This technically
means that KVM will exit to userspace instead of emulating on
RET_PF_INVALID, but practically speaking it's a nop as the MMU never
returns RET_PF_INVALID.
