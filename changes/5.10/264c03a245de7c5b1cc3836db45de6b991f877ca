stacktrace: Remove reliable argument from arch_stack_walk() callback

Currently the callback passed to arch_stack_walk() has an argument called
reliable passed to it to indicate if the stack entry is reliable, a comment
says that this is used by some printk() consumers. However in the current
kernel none of the arch_stack_walk() implementations ever set this flag to
true and the only callback implementation we have is in the generic
stacktrace code which ignores the flag. It therefore appears that this
flag is redundant so we can simplify and clarify things by removing it.
