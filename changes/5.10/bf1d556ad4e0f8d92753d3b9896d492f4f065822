media: mtk-vcodec: abstract firmware interface

MT8183's codec firmware is run by a different remote processor from
MT8173. While the firmware interface is basically the same, the way to
invoke it differs. Abstract all firmware calls under a layer that will
allow us to handle both firmware types transparently.

[acourbot: refactor, cleanup and split]
[pihsun: fix error path and add mtk_vcodec_fw_release]
[hverkuil: fixed some checkpatch alignment warnings]
