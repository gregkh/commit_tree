s390/checksum: rewrite csum_tcpudp_nofold()

Rewrite csum_tcpudp_nofold() so that the generated code will not
contain branches. The old implementation was also optimized for
machines which came with "add logical with carry" instructions,
however the compiler doesn't generate them anymore. This is most
likely because those instructions are slower.

However with the old code the compiler generates a lot of branches,
which isn't too helpful usually. Therefore rewrite the code.

In a tight loop this doesn't make any difference since the branch
prediction unit does its job.
