dt-bindings: can: fsl,flexcan.yaml: fix compatible for i.MX35 and i.MX53

As both the i.MX35 and i.MX53 flexcan IP cores are compatible to the i.MX25,
they are listed as:

    compatible = "fsl,imx35-flexcan", "fsl,imx25-flexcan";

and:

    compatible = "fsl,imx53-flexcan", "fsl,imx25-flexcan";

in the SoC device trees.

This patch fixes the following errors, which shows up during a dtbs_check:

arch/arm/boot/dts/imx53-ard.dt.yaml: can@53fc8000: compatible: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
   ['fsl,imx53-flexcan', 'fsl,imx25-flexcan'] is too long
   Additional items are not allowed ('fsl,imx25-flexcan' was unexpected)
   'fsl,imx53-flexcan' is not one of ['fsl,imx7d-flexcan', 'fsl,imx6ul-flexcan', 'fsl,imx6sx-flexcan']
   'fsl,imx53-flexcan' is not one of ['fsl,ls1028ar1-flexcan']
   'fsl,imx6q-flexcan' was expected
   'fsl,lx2160ar1-flexcan' was expected
   From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/can/fsl,flexcan.yaml
