gfs2: Free rd_bits later in gfs2_clear_rgrpd to fix use-after-free

Function gfs2_clear_rgrpd calls kfree(rgd->rd_bits) before calling
return_all_reservations, but return_all_reservations still dereferences
rgd->rd_bits in __rs_deltree.  Fix that by moving the call to kfree below the
call to return_all_reservations.
