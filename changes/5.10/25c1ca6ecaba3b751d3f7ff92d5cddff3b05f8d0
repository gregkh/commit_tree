nvme-rdma: handle unexpected nvme completion data length

Receiving a zero length message leads to the following warnings because
the CQE is processed twice:

refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at lib/refcount.c:28

RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0xd9/0xe0
Call Trace:
 <IRQ>
 nvme_rdma_recv_done+0xf3/0x280 [nvme_rdma]
 __ib_process_cq+0x76/0x150 [ib_core]
 ...

Sanity check the received data length, to avoids this.

Thanks to Chao Leng & Sagi for suggestions.
