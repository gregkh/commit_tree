scripts: kernel-doc: reimplement -nofunction argument

Right now, the build system doesn't use -nofunction, as
it is pretty much useless, because it doesn't consider
the other output modes (extern, internal), working only
with all.

Also, it is limited to exclude functions.

Re-implement it in order to allow excluding any symbols from
the document output, no matter what mode is used.

The parameter was also renamed to "-nosymbol", as it express
better its meaning.
