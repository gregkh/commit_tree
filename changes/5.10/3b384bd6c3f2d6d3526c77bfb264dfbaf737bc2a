Input: raydium_ts_i2c - do not split tx transactions

Raydium device does not like splitting of tx transactions into multiple
messages - one for the register address and one for the actual data. This
results in incorrect behavior on the device side.

This change updates raydium_i2c_read and raydium_i2c_write to create
i2c_msg arrays separately and passes those arrays into raydium_i2c_xfer
which decides based on the address whether the bank switch command should
be sent. The bank switch header is still added by raydium_i2c_read and
raydium_i2c_write to ensure that all these operations are performed as part
of a single I2C transfer. It guarantees that no other transactions are
initiated to any other device on the same bus after the bank switch command
is sent.
