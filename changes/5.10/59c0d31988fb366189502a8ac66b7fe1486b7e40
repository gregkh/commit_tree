selftests: net: tcp_mmap: Use huge pages in receive path

One down side of using TCP rx zerocopy is one extra TLB miss
per page after the mapping operation.

While if the application is using hugepages, the non zerocopy
recvmsg() will not have to pay these TLB costs.

This patch allows server side to use huge pages for
the non zero copy case, to allow fair comparisons when
both solutions use optimal conditions.
