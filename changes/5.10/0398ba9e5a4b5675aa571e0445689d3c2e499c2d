net: tipc: prevent possible null deref of link

`tipc_node_apply_property` does a null check on a `tipc_link_entry`
pointer but also accesses the same pointer out of the null check block.

This triggers a warning on Coverity Static Analyzer because we're
implying that `e->link` can BE null.

Move "Update MTU for node link entry" line into if block to make sure
that we're not in a state that `e->link` is null.
