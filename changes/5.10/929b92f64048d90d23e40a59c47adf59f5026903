xfs: xfs_defer_capture should absorb remaining transaction reservation

When xfs_defer_capture extracts the deferred ops and transaction state
from a transaction, it should record the transaction reservation type
from the old transaction so that when we continue the dfops chain, we
still use the same reservation parameters.

Doing this means that the log item recovery functions get to determine
the transaction reservation instead of abusing tr_itruncate in yet
another part of xfs.
