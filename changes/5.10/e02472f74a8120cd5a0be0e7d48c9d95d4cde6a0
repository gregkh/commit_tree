iio:temperature:mlx90632: Adding extended calibration option

For some time the market wants medical grade accuracy in medical range,
while still retaining the declared accuracy outside of the medical range
within the same sensor. That is why we created extended calibration
which is automatically switched to when object temperature is too high.

This patch also introduces the object_ambient_temperature variable which
is needed for more accurate calculation of the object infra-red
footprint as sensor's ambient temperature might be totally different
than what the ambient temperature is at object and that is why we can
have some more errors which can be eliminated. Currently this temperature
is fixed at 25, but the interface to adjust it by user (with external
sensor or just IR measurement of the other object which acts as ambient),
will be introduced in another commit.
