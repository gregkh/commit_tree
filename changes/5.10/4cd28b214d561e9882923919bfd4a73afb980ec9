net: ena: xdp: add queue counters for xdp actions

When using XDP every ingress packet is passed to an eBPF (xdp) program
which returns an action for this packet.

This patch adds counters for the number of times each such action was
received. It also counts all the invalid actions received from the eBPF
program.
