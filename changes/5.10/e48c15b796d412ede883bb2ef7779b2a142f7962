smp: Add source and destination CPUs to __call_single_data

This commit adds a destination CPU to __call_single_data, and is inspired
by an earlier commit by Peter Zijlstra.  This version adds #ifdef to
permit use by 32-bit systems and supplying the destination CPU for all
smp_call_function*() requests, not just smp_call_function_single().

If need be, 32-bit systems could be accommodated by shrinking the flags
field to 16 bits (the atomic_t variant is currently unused) and by
providing only eight bits for CPU on such systems.

It is not clear that the addition of the fields to __call_single_node
are really needed.
