ixgbe: fix probing of multi-port devices with one MDIO

Ian reports that after upgrade from v5.8.14 to v5.9 only one
of his 4 ixgbe netdevs appear in the system.

Quoting the comment on ixgbe_x550em_a_has_mii():
 * Returns true if hw points to lowest numbered PCI B:D.F x550_em_a device in
 * the SoC.  There are up to 4 MACs sharing a single MDIO bus on the x550em_a,
 * but we only want to register one MDIO bus.

This matches the symptoms, since the return value from
ixgbe_mii_bus_init() is no longer ignored we need to handle
the higher ports of x550em without an error.
