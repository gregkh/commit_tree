KVM: x86/mmu: Refactor the zap loop for recovering NX lpages

Refactor the zap loop in kvm_recover_nx_lpages() to be a for loop that
iterates on to_zap and drop the !to_zap check that leads to the in-loop
calling of kvm_mmu_commit_zap_page().  The in-loop commit when to_zap
hits zero is superfluous now that there's an unconditional commit after
the loop to handle the case where lpage_disallowed_mmu_pages is emptied.
