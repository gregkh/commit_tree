fscrypt: make "#define fscrypt_policy" user-only

The fscrypt UAPI header defines fscrypt_policy to fscrypt_policy_v1,
for source compatibility with old userspace programs.

Internally, the kernel doesn't want that compatibility definition.
Instead, fscrypt_private.h #undefs it and re-defines it to a union.

That works for now.  However, in order to add
fscrypt_operations::get_dummy_policy(), we'll need to forward declare
'union fscrypt_policy' in include/linux/fscrypt.h.  That would cause
build errors because "fscrypt_policy" is used in ioctl numbers.

To avoid this, modify the UAPI header to make the fscrypt_policy
compatibility definition conditional on !__KERNEL__, and make the ioctls
use fscrypt_policy_v1 instead of fscrypt_policy.

Note that this doesn't change the actual ioctl numbers.
