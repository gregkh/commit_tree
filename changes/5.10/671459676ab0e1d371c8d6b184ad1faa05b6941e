xfs: fix finobt btree block recovery ordering

Nathan popped up on #xfs and pointed out that we fail to handle
finobt btree blocks in xlog_recover_get_buf_lsn(). This means they
always fall through the entire magic number matching code to "recover
immediately". Whilst most of the time this is the correct behaviour,
occasionally it will be incorrect and could potentially overwrite
more recent metadata because we don't check the LSN in the on disk
metadata at all.

This bug has been present since the finobt was first introduced, and
is a potential cause of the occasional xfs_iget_check_free_state()
failures we see that indicate that the inode btree state does not
match the on disk inode state.

Fixes: aafc3c246529 ("xfs: support the XFS_BTNUM_FINOBT free inode btree type")
