mm/gup: take mmap_lock in get_dump_page()

Properly take the mmap_lock before calling into the GUP code from
get_dump_page(); and play nice, allowing the GUP code to drop the
mmap_lock if it has to sleep.

As Linus pointed out, we don't actually need the VMA because
__get_user_pages() will flush the dcache for us if necessary.
