ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix bass speaker DAC assignment on Asus Zephyrus G14

ASUS Zephyrus G14 has two speaker pins, and the auto-parser tries to
assign an individual DAC to each pin as much as possible.
Unfortunately the third DAC has no volume control unlike the two DACs,
and this resulted in the inconsistent speaker volumes.

As a workaround, wire both speaker pins to the same DAC by modifying
the existing quirk (ALC289_FIXUP_ASUS_GA401) applied to this device.
Since this quirk entry is chained by another, we need to avoid
applying the DAC assignment change for it.  Luckily, there is another
quirk entry (ALC289_FIXUP_ASUS_GA502) doing the very same thing, so we
can chain to the GA502 quirk instead.

Note that this patch uses a new flag of the generic parser,
obey_preferred_dacs, for enforcing the DACs.
