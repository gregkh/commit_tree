drm/i915/gem: Serialise debugfs i915_gem_objects with ctx->mutex

Since the debugfs may peek into the GEM contexts as the corresponding
client/fd is being closed, we may try and follow a dangling pointer.
However, the context closure itself is serialised with the ctx->mutex,
so if we hold that mutex as we inspect the state coupled in the context,
we know the pointers within the context are stable and will remain valid
as we inspect their tables.
