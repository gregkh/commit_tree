mtd: nand: Create helpers to set/extract the ECC requirements

Despite its current name, the eccreq field actually encodes both the
NAND requirements and the final ECC configuration. That works fine when
using on-die ECC since those 2 concepts match perfectly, but it starts
being a problem as soon as we use on-host ECC engines, where we're not
guaranteed to have a perfect match.

Let's hide the ECC requirements access behind helpers so we can later
split those 2 concepts. As the structures have not been clarified yet,
these helpers access the same internal variable as
nanddev_get_ecc_conf() for now.
