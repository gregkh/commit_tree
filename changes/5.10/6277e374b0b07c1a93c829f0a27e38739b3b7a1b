efi: Add definition of EFI_MEMORY_CPU_CRYPTO and ability to report it

Incorporate the definition of EFI_MEMORY_CPU_CRYPTO from the UEFI
specification v2.8, and wire it into our memory map dumping routine
as well.

To make a bit of space in the output buffer, which is provided by
the various callers, shorten the descriptive names of the memory
types.
