xfrm: Provide API to register translator module

Add a skeleton for xfrm_compat module and provide API to register it in
xfrm_state.ko. struct xfrm_translator will have function pointers to
translate messages received from 32-bit userspace or to be sent to it
from 64-bit kernel.
module_get()/module_put() are used instead of rcu_read_lock() as the
module will vmalloc() memory for translation.
The new API is registered with xfrm_state module, not with xfrm_user as
the former needs translator for user_policy set by setsockopt() and
xfrm_user already uses functions from xfrm_state.
