selftests/powerpc: Fix prefixes in alignment_handler signal handler

The signal handler in the alignment handler self test has the ability
to jump over the instruction that triggered the signal. It does this
by incrementing the PT_NIP in the user context by 4. If it were a
prefixed instruction this will mean that the suffix is then executed
which is incorrect. Instead check if the major opcode indicates a
prefixed instruction (e.g. it is 1) and if so increment PT_NIP by 8.

If ISA v3.1 is not available treat it as a word instruction even if
the major opcode is 1.
