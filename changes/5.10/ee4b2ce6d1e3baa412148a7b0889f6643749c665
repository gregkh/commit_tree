s390/mm,ptdump: sort markers

Kasan configuration options and size of physical memory present could
affect kernel memory layout. In particular vmemmap, vmalloc and modules
might come before kasan shadow or after it. To make ptdump correctly
output markers in the right order markers have to be sorted.

To preserve the original order of markers with the same start address
avoid using sort() from lib/sort.c (which is not stable sorting algorithm)
and sort markers in place.
