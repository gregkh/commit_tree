cpufreq,arm,arm64: restructure definitions of arch_set_freq_scale()

Compared to other arch_* functions, arch_set_freq_scale() has an atypical
weak definition that can be replaced by a strong architecture specific
implementation.

The more typical support for architectural functions involves defining
an empty stub in a header file if the symbol is not already defined in
architecture code. Some examples involve:
 - #define arch_scale_freq_capacity	topology_get_freq_scale
 - #define arch_scale_freq_invariant	topology_scale_freq_invariant
 - #define arch_scale_cpu_capacity	topology_get_cpu_scale
 - #define arch_update_cpu_topology	topology_update_cpu_topology
 - #define arch_scale_thermal_pressure	topology_get_thermal_pressure
 - #define arch_set_thermal_pressure	topology_set_thermal_pressure

Bring arch_set_freq_scale() in line with these functions by renaming it to
topology_set_freq_scale() in the arch topology driver, and by defining the
arch_set_freq_scale symbol to point to the new function for arm and arm64.

While there are other users of the arch_topology driver, this patch defines
arch_set_freq_scale for arm and arm64 only, due to their existing
definitions of arch_scale_freq_capacity. This is the getter function of the
frequency invariance scale factor and without a getter function, the
setter function - arch_set_freq_scale() has not purpose.
