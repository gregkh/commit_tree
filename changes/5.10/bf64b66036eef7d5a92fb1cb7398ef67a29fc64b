spi: dw: Add generic DW SSI status-check method

The DW SSI errors handling method can be generically implemented for all
types of the transfers: IRQ, DMA and poll-based ones. It will be a
function which checks the overflow/underflow error flags and resets the
controller if any of them is set. In the framework of this commit we make
use of the new method to detect the errors in the IRQ- and DMA-based SPI
transfer execution procedures.
