x86/entry/64: Do not include inst.h in calling.h

inst.h was included in calling.h solely to instantiate the RDPID macro.
The usage of RDPID was removed in

  6a3ea3e68b8a ("x86/entry/64: Do not use RDPID in paranoid entry to accomodate KVM")

so remove the include.

Fixes: 6a3ea3e68b8a ("x86/entry/64: Do not use RDPID in paranoid entry to accomodate KVM")
