ext4: main fast-commit commit path

This patch adds main fast commit commit path handlers. The overall
patch can be divided into two inter-related parts:

(A) Metadata updates tracking

    This part consists of helper functions to track changes that need
    to be committed during a commit operation. These updates are
    maintained by Ext4 in different in-memory queues. Following are
    the APIs and their short description that are implemented in this
    patch:

    - ext4_fc_track_link/unlink/creat() - Track unlink. link and creat
      operations
    - ext4_fc_track_range() - Track changed logical block offsets
      inodes
    - ext4_fc_track_inode() - Track inodes
    - ext4_fc_mark_ineligible() - Mark file system fast commit
      ineligible()
    - ext4_fc_start_update() / ext4_fc_stop_update() /
      ext4_fc_start_ineligible() / ext4_fc_stop_ineligible() These
      functions are useful for co-ordinating inode updates with
      commits.

(B) Main commit Path

    This part consists of functions to convert updates tracked in
    in-memory data structures into on-disk commits. Function
    ext4_fc_commit() is the main entry point to commit path.
