powercap: restrict energy meter to root access

Remove non-privileged user access to power data contained in
/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl*/*/energy_uj

Non-privileged users currently have read access to power data and can
use this data to form a security attack. Some privileged
drivers/applications need read access to this data, but don't expose it
to non-privileged users.

For example, thermald uses this data to ensure that power management
works correctly. Thus removing non-privileged access is preferred over
completely disabling this power reporting capability with
CONFIG_INTEL_RAPL=n.
