mmc: tmio: factor out common parts of the reset routine

Some TMIO variants need specific actions in their reset routine, but
they are all based on a generic reset routine. So, the optional 'reset'
callback will now only take care of the additional stuff and we will
have a generic function around it. Less code, easier to maintain, and
much more readable. Code in tmio_mmc.c is untested but in my TC6387XB
datasheet the SDIO part is reset independently from the SD part, too.
