bpftool: Support dumping metadata

Dump metadata in the 'bpftool prog' list if it's present.
For some formatting some BTF code is put directly in the
metadata dumping. Sanity checks on the map and the kind of the btf_type
to make sure we are actually dumping what we are expecting.

A helper jsonw_reset is added to json writer so we can reuse the same
json writer without having extraneous commas.

Sample output:

  $ bpftool prog
  6: cgroup_skb  name prog  tag bcf7977d3b93787c  gpl
  [...]
  	btf_id 4
  	metadata:
  		a = "foo"
  		b = 1

  $ bpftool prog --json --pretty
  [{
          "id": 6,
  [...]
          "btf_id": 4,
          "metadata": {
              "a": "foo",
              "b": 1
          }
      }
  ]
