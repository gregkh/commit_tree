bnxt_en: perform no master recovery during startup

The NS3 SoC platforms require assistance from the OP-TEE to recover
firmware if a crash occurs while no driver is bound. The
CRASHED_NO_MASTER condition is recorded in the firmware status register
during the crash to indicate when driver intervension is needed to
coordinate a firmware reload. This condition is detected during early
driver initialization in order to effect a firmware fastboot on
supported platforms when necessary.
