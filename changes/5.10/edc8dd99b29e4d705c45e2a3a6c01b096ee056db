powerpc/watchpoint: Move DAWR detection logic outside of hw_breakpoint.c

Power10 hw has multiple DAWRs but hw doesn't tell which DAWR caused
the exception. So we have a sw logic to detect that in hw_breakpoint.c.
But hw_breakpoint.c gets compiled only with CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT=Y.
Move DAWR detection logic outside of hw_breakpoint.c so that it can be
reused when CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT is not set.
