perf/x86/amd/ibs: Don't include randomized bits in get_ibs_op_count()

get_ibs_op_count() adds hardware's current count (IbsOpCurCnt) bits
to its count regardless of hardware's valid status.

According to the PPR for AMD Family 17h Model 31h B0 55803 Rev 0.54,
if the counter rolls over, valid status is set, and the lower 7 bits
of IbsOpCurCnt are randomized by hardware.

Don't include those bits in the driver's event count.
