x86/resctrl: Use is_closid_match() in more places

rdtgroup_tasks_assigned() and show_rdt_tasks() loop over threads testing
for a CTRL/MON group match by closid/rmid with the provided rdtgrp.
Further down the file are helpers to do this, move these further up and
make use of them here.

These helpers additionally check for alloc/mon capable. This is harmless
as rdtgroup_mkdir() tests these capable flags before allowing the config
directories to be created.
