PCI: dwc: Ensure FAST_LINK_MODE is cleared

"Fast Link Mode" is a simulation environment speed up setting which should
never be set and the default is not set. However some Amlogic platforms
have it set (by firmware presumably). See commit 87dccf09323f ("PCI:
amlogic: meson: Don't use FAST_LINK_MODE to set up link") for more
information. Let's clear it in core DWC code so we can drop some vendor
specific code.
