Bluetooth: hci_intel: drop strange le16_to_cpu() against u8 values

Sparse rightfully complains:

  hci_intel.c:696:26: warning: cast to restricted __le16
  hci_intel.c:701:26: warning: cast to restricted __le16
  hci_intel.c:702:26: warning: cast to restricted __le16
  hci_intel.c:703:26: warning: cast to restricted __le16
  hci_intel.c:725:26: warning: cast to restricted __le16
  hci_intel.c:730:26: warning: cast to restricted __le16
  hci_intel.c:731:26: warning: cast to restricted __le16
  hci_intel.c:732:26: warning: cast to restricted __le16

because we access non-restricted types with le16_to_cpu().
More confusion is added by using above against u8. On big-endian
architecture we will get all zeroes. I bet it's not what should be
in such case.
