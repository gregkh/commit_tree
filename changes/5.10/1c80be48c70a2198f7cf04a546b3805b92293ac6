drm/vc4: bo: Add a managed action to cleanup the cache

The BO cache needs to be cleaned up using vc4_bo_cache_destroy, but it's
not used consistently (vc4_drv's bind calls it in its error path, but
doesn't in unbind), and we can make that automatic through a managed
action. Let's remove the requirement to call vc4_bo_cache_destroy.
