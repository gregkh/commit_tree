fscrypt: export fscrypt_d_revalidate()

Dentries that represent no-key names must have a dentry_operations that
includes fscrypt_d_revalidate().  Currently, this is handled by
fscrypt_prepare_lookup() installing fscrypt_d_ops.

However, ceph support for encryption
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200914191707.380444-1-jlayton@kernel.org)
can't use fscrypt_d_ops, since ceph already has its own
dentry_operations.

Similarly, ext4 and f2fs support for directories that are both encrypted
and casefolded
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200923010151.69506-1-drosen@google.com)
can't use fscrypt_d_ops either, since casefolding requires some dentry
operations too.

To satisfy both users, we need to move the responsibility of installing
the dentry_operations to filesystems.

In preparation for this, export fscrypt_d_revalidate() and give it a
!CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION stub.
