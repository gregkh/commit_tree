vsock: forward all packets to the host when no H2G is registered

Before commit c0cfa2d8a788 ("vsock: add multi-transports support"),
if a G2H transport was loaded (e.g. virtio transport), every packets
was forwarded to the host, regardless of the destination CID.
The H2G transports implemented until then (vhost-vsock, VMCI) always
responded with an error, if the destination CID was not
VMADDR_CID_HOST.

From that commit, we are using the remote CID to decide which
transport to use, so packets with remote CID > VMADDR_CID_HOST(2)
are sent only through H2G transport. If no H2G is available, packets
are discarded directly in the guest.

Some use cases (e.g. Nitro Enclaves [1]) rely on the old behaviour
to implement sibling VMs communication, so we restore the old
behavior when no H2G is registered.
It will be up to the host to discard packets if the destination is
not the right one. As it was already implemented before adding
multi-transport support.

Tested with nested QEMU/KVM by me and Nitro Enclaves by Andra.
