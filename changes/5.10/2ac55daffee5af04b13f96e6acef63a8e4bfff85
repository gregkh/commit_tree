ALSA: riptide: Replace tasklet with threaded irq

The tasklet is an old API that should be deprecated, usually can be
converted to another decent API.  In Riptide driver, a tasklet is
still used for offloading the PCM IRQ handling.  It can be achieved
gracefully with a threaded IRQ, too.

This patch replaces the tasklet usage in riptide driver with a
threaded IRQ.
