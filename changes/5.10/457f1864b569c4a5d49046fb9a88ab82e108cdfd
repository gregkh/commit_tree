btrfs: pretty print leaked root name

I'm a actual human being so am incapable of converting u64 to s64 in my
head, so add a helper to get the pretty name of a root objectid and use
that helper to spit out the name for any special roots for leaked roots,
so I don't have to scratch my head and figure out which root I messed up
the refs for.
