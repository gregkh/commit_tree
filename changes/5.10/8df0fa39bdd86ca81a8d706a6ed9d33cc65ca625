xfs: don't free rt blocks when we're doing a REMAP bunmapi call

When callers pass XFS_BMAPI_REMAP into xfs_bunmapi, they want the extent
to be unmapped from the given file fork without the extent being freed.
We do this for non-rt files, but we forgot to do this for realtime
files.  So far this isn't a big deal since nobody makes a bunmapi call
to a rt file with the REMAP flag set, but don't leave a logic bomb.
