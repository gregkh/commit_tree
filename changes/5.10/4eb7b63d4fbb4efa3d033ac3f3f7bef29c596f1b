arm64: dts: qcom: pm8916: Add resin node

Right now we define the entire pm8916 resin node separately in
the board-specific device tree part, including the interrupt that
belongs to PM8916.

As a feature of the PMIC it should be declared in pm8916.dtsi,
disabled by default. Like all other optional components it can then
by enabled and configured in the board-specific device tree part.
