ARM: exynos: clear L310_AUX_CTRL_NS_LOCKDOWN in default l2c_aux_val

The L310_AUX_CTRL_NS_LOCKDOWN flag is set during the L2C enable
sequence.  There is no need to set it in the default register value,
this was done before support for it was implemented in the code.  It
is not set in the hardware initial value either.

Clean this up by removing this flag from the default l2c_aux_val, and
add it to the l2c_aux_mask to print an alert message if it was already
set before the kernel initialisation.
