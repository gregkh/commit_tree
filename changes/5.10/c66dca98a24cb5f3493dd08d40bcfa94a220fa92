samples/bpf: Set rlimit for memlock to infinity in all samples

The memlock rlimit is a notorious source of failure for BPF programs. Most
of the samples just set it to infinity, but a few used a lower limit. The
problem with unconditionally setting a lower limit is that this will also
override the limit if the system-wide setting is *higher* than the limit
being set, which can lead to failures on systems that lock a lot of memory,
but set 'ulimit -l' to unlimited before running a sample.

One fix for this is to only conditionally set the limit if the current
limit is lower, but it is simpler to just unify all the samples and have
them all set the limit to infinity.
