staging: rtl8188eu: clean up comparsion style issues

Move constants to the right side of comparsions to follow kernel
coding style and clear checkpatch warnings. In case of comparsion
to _FAIL we can use '!' since _FAIL is defined as '0'.

WARNING: Comparisons should place the constant on the right side of the test
