powerpc: Remove CONFIG_PPC601_SYNC_FIX

This config option isn't in any defconfig.

The very first versions of Powerpc 601 have a bug which
requires additional sync before and/or after some instructions.

This was more than 25 years ago and time has come to retire
those buggy versions of the 601 from the kernel.
