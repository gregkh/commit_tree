gpiolib: fix sysfs when cdev is not selected

In gpiochip_setup_dev() the call to gpiolib_cdev_register() indirectly
calls device_add().  This is still required for the sysfs even when
CONFIG_GPIO_CDEV is not selected in the build.

Replace the stubbed functions in gpiolib-cdev.h with macros in gpiolib.c
that perform the required device_add() and device_del() when
CONFIG_GPIO_CDEV is not selected.
