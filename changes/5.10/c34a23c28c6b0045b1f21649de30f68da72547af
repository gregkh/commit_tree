RDMA/restrack: Simplify restrack tracking in kernel flows

Have a single rdma_restrack_add() that adds an entry, there is no reason
to split the user/kernel here, the rdma_restrack_set_task() is responsible
for this difference.

This patch prepares the code to the future requirement of making restrack
is mandatory for managing ib objects.
