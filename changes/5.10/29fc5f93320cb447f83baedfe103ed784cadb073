rcu: Force DEFAULT_RCU_BLIMIT to 1000 for strict RCU GPs

The value of DEFAULT_RCU_BLIMIT is normally set to 10, the idea being to
avoid needless response-time degradation due to RCU callback invocation.
However, when CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=y it is better to avoid
throttling callback execution in order to better detect pointer
leaks from RCU read-side critical sections.  This commit therefore
sets the value of DEFAULT_RCU_BLIMIT to 1000 in kernels built with
CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=y.
