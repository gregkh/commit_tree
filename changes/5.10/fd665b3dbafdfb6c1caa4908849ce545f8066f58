net: hns3: replace macro HNS3_MAX_NON_TSO_BD_NUM

Currently, the driver is able to query the device's specifications,
which includes the maximum BD number of non TSO packet, so replace
macro HNS3_MAX_NON_TSO_BD_NUM with the queried value, and rewrite
macro HNS3_MAX_NON_TSO_SIZE whose value depends on the the maximum
BD number of non TSO packet.

Also, add a new parameter max_non_tso_bd_num to function
hns3_tx_bd_num() and hns3_skb_need_linearized(), then they can get
the maximum BD number of non TSO packet from the caller instead of
calculating by themself, The note of hns3_skb_need_linearized()
should be update as well.
