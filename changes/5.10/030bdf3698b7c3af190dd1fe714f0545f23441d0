KVM: arm64: Fix some documentation build warnings

As warned with make htmldocs:

	.../Documentation/virt/kvm/devices/vcpu.rst:70: WARNING: Malformed table.
	Text in column margin in table line 2.

	=======  ======================================================
	-ENODEV: PMUv3 not supported or GIC not initialized
	-ENXIO:  PMUv3 not properly configured or in-kernel irqchip not
	         configured as required prior to calling this attribute
	-EBUSY:  PMUv3 already initialized
	-EINVAL: Invalid filter range
	=======  ======================================================

The ':' character for two lines are above the size of the column.
Besides that, other tables at the file doesn't use ':', so
just drop them.

While here, also fix this warning also introduced at the same patch:

	.../Documentation/virt/kvm/devices/vcpu.rst:88: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

By marking the C code as a literal block.
