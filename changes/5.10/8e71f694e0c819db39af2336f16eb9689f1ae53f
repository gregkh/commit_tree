IB/rdmavt: Fix sizeof mismatch

An incorrect sizeof is being used, struct rvt_ibport ** is not correct, it
should be struct rvt_ibport *. Note that since ** is the same size as
* this is not causing any issues.  Improve this fix by using
sizeof(*rdi->ports) as this allows us to not even reference the type
of the pointer.  Also remove line breaks as the entire statement can
fit on one line.
