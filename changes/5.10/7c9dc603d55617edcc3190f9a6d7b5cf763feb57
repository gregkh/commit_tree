coccinelle: misc: add uninitialized_var.cocci script

uninitialized_var() macro was removed from the sources [1] and
other warning-silencing tricks were deprecated [2]. The purpose of this
cocci script is to prevent new occurrences of uninitialized_var()
open-coded variants.

[1] commit 63a0895d960a ("compiler: Remove uninitialized_var() macro")
[2] commit 4b19bec97c88 ("docs: deprecated.rst: Add uninitialized_var()")
