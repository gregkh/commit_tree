powerpc/8xx: Manage _PAGE_ACCESSED through APG bits in L1 entry

When _PAGE_ACCESSED is not set, a minor fault is expected.
To do this, TLB miss exception ANDs _PAGE_PRESENT and _PAGE_ACCESSED
into the L2 entry valid bit.

To simplify the processing and reduce the number of instructions in
TLB miss exceptions, manage it as an APG bit and get it next to
_PAGE_GUARDED bit to allow a copy in one go. Then declare the
corresponding groups as handling all accesses as user accesses.
As the PP bits always define user as No Access, it will generate
a fault.
