firmware: arm_sdei: Unregister driver on error in sdei_init()

The SDEI platform device is created from device-tree node or ACPI
(SDEI) table. For the later case, the platform device is created
explicitly by this module. It'd better to unregister the driver on
failure to create the device to keep the symmetry. The driver, owned
by this module, isn't needed if the device isn't existing.

Besides, the errno (@ret) should be updated accordingly in this
case.
