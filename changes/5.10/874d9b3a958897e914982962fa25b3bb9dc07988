x86/irq: Prepare consolidation of irq_alloc_info

struct irq_alloc_info is a horrible zoo of unnamed structs in a union. Many
of the struct fields can be generic and don't have to be type specific like
hpet_id, ioapic_id...

Provide a generic set of members to prepare for the consolidation. The goal
is to make irq_alloc_info have the same basic member as the generic
msi_alloc_info so generic MSI domain ops can be reused and yet more mess
can be avoided when (non-PCI) device MSI support comes along.
