KVM: VMX: Rename "vmx_msr_index" to "vmx_uret_msrs_list"

Rename "vmx_msr_index" to "vmx_uret_msrs_list" to associate it with the
uret MSRs array, and to avoid conflating "MSR's ECX index" with "MSR's
index into an array".  Similarly, don't use "slot" in the name as that
terminology is claimed by the common x86 "user_return_msrs" mechanism.

No functional change intended.
