btrfs: introduce BTRFS_NESTING_LEFT/BTRFS_NESTING_RIGHT

Our lockdep maps are based on rootid+level, however in some cases we
will lock adjacent blocks on the same level, namely in searching forward
or in split/balance.  Because of this lockdep will complain, so we need
a separate subclass to indicate to lockdep that these are different
locks.

lock leaf -> BTRFS_NESTING_NORMAL
  cow leaf -> BTRFS_NESTING_COW
    split leaf
       lock left -> BTRFS_NESTING_LEFT
       lock right -> BTRFS_NESTING_RIGHT

The above graph illustrates the need for this new nesting subclass.
