mlx5: add pause frame stats

Plumb through all the indirection and copy some code from
ethtool -S. The names of the group indicate that these are
the stats we are after (and Saeed confirms it).

v3:
 - fix build in mlx5_rep
v2:
 - drop the ethool helper and call stats directly
 - don't pass 0 as initialized to in buffer
 - use local buffer
