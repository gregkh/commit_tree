sfc: don't double-down() filters in ef100_reset()

dev_close(), by way of ef100_net_stop(), already brings down the filter
 table, so there's no need to do it again (which just causes lots of
 WARN_ONs).
Similarly, don't bring it up ourselves, as dev_open() -> ef100_net_open()
 will do it, and will fail if it's already been brought up.
