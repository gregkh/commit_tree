firmware: arm_sdei: Remove _sdei_event_register()

The function _sdei_event_register() is called by sdei_event_register()
and sdei_device_thaw() as the following functional call chain shows.
_sdei_event_register() covers the shared and private events, but
sdei_device_thaw() only covers the shared events. So the logic to
cover the private events in _sdei_event_register() isn't needed by
sdei_device_thaw().

Similarly, sdei_reregister_event_llocked() covers the shared and
private events in the regard of reenablement. The logic to cover
the private events isn't needed by sdei_device_thaw() either.

   sdei_event_register          sdei_device_thaw
      _sdei_event_register         sdei_reregister_shared
                                      sdei_reregister_event_llocked
                                         _sdei_event_register

This removes _sdei_event_register() and sdei_reregister_event_llocked().
Their logic is moved to sdei_event_register() and sdei_reregister_shared().
This shouldn't cause any logical changes.
