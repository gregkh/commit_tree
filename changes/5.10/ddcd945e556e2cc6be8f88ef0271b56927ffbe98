rtw88: fix fw_fifo_addr check

The clang build reports this warning

fw.c:1485:21: warning: address of array 'rtwdev->chip->fw_fifo_addr'
  will always evaluate to 'true'
        if (!rtwdev->chip->fw_fifo_addr) {

fw_fifo_addr is an array in rtw_chip_info so it is always
nonzero.  A better check is if the first element of the array is
nonzero.  In the cases where fw_fifo_addr is initialized by rtw88b
and rtw88c, the first array element is 0x780.
