scsi: be2iscsi: Fix a theoretical leak in beiscsi_create_eqs()

The be_fill_queue() function can only fail when "eq_vaddress" is NULL and
since it's non-NULL here that means the function call can't fail.  But
imagine if it could, then in that situation we would want to store the
"paddr" so that dma memory can be released.
