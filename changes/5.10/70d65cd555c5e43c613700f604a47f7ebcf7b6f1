ppc: propagate the calling conventions change down to csum_partial_copy_generic()

... and get rid of the pointless fallback in the wrappers.  On error it used
to zero the unwritten area and calculate the csum of the entire thing.  Not
wanting to do it in assembler part had been very reasonable; doing that in
the first place, OTOH...  In case of an error the caller discards the data
we'd copied, along with whatever checksum it might've had.
