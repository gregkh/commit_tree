xsk: Move xsk_tx_list and its lock to buffer pool

Move the xsk_tx_list and the xsk_tx_list_lock from the umem to
the buffer pool. This so that we in a later commit can share the
umem between multiple HW queues. There is one xsk_tx_list per
device and queue id, so it should be located in the buffer pool.
