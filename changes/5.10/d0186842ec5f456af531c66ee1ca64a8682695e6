net: vlan: Avoid using BUG() in vlan_proto_idx()

While we should always make sure that we specify a valid VLAN protocol
to vlan_proto_idx(), killing the machine when an invalid value is
specified is too harsh and not helpful for debugging. All callers are
capable of dealing with an error returned by vlan_proto_idx() so check
the index value and propagate it accordingly.
