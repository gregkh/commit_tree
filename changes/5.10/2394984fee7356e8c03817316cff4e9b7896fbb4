media: staging: media: atomisp: Fix bool-related style issues

Address the following issues:
 * unnecessary comparison to true/false
 * use of 0/1 instead of bool values
 * unnecessary conversion to bool

These were fixed using the following Coccinelle scripts:
 * scripts/coccinelle/misc/bool{init,conv,return}.cocci

Build-tested with allmodconfig.
