powerpc/numa: Set numa_node for all possible cpus

A Powerpc system with multiple possible nodes and with CONFIG_NUMA
enabled always used to have a node 0, even if node 0 does not any cpus
or memory attached to it. As per PAPR, node affinity of a cpu is only
available once its present / online. For all cpus that are possible but
not present, cpu_to_node() would point to node 0.

To ensure a cpuless, memoryless dummy node is not online, powerpc need
to make sure all possible but not present cpu_to_node are set to a
proper node.
