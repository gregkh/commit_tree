drm/bridge/synopsys: dsi: allow sending longer LP commands

Current code does not properly computes the max length of LP
commands that can be send during H or V sync, and rely on static
values.
Limiting the max LP length to 4 byte during the V-sync is overly
conservative.

Relax the limit and allows longer LP commands (16 bytes) to be
sent during V-sync.
