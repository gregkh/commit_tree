arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Move more supplies to msm8916-pm8916.dtsi

So far we had some supplies defined for all boards in msm8916.dtsi,
while others were duplicated into every board-specific device tree.

Now that we have msm8916-pm8916.dtsi as a common include for all
standard MSM8916 devices using PM8916, move the remaining common
supplies to msm8916-pm8916.dtsi to reduce duplication a bit.
