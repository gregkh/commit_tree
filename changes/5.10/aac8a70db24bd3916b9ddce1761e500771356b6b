xen-blkback: add a parameter for disabling of persistent grants

Persistent grants feature provides high scalability.  On some small
systems, however, it could incur data copy overheads[1] and thus it is
required to be disabled.  But, there is no option to disable it.  For
the reason, this commit adds a module parameter for disabling of the
feature.
