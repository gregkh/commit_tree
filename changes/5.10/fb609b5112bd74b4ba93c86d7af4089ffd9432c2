net/mlx5: Always use container_of to find mdev pointer from clock struct

Clock struct is part of struct mlx5_core_dev. Code was inconsistent, on
some cases used container_of and on another used clock->mdev.

Align code to use container_of amd remove clock->mdev pointer.
While here, fix reverse xmas tree coding style.
