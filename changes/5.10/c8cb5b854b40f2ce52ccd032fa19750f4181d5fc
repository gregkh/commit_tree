nl80211/cfg80211: support 6 GHz scanning

Support 6 GHz scanning, by
 * a new scan flag to scan for colocated BSSes advertised
   by (and found) APs on 2.4 & 5 GHz
 * doing the necessary reduced neighbor report parsing for
   this, to find them
 * adding the ability to split the scan request in case the
   device by itself cannot support this.

Also add some necessary bits in mac80211 to not break with
these changes.
