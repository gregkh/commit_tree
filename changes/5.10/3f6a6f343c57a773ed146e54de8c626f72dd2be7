drm/i915: Reduce i915_request.lock contention for i915_request_wait

Currently, we use i915_request_completed() directly in
i915_request_wait() and follow up with a manual invocation of
dma_fence_signal(). This appears to cause a large number of contentions
on i915_request.lock as when the process is woken up after the fence is
signaled by an interrupt, we will then try and call dma_fence_signal()
ourselves while the signaler is still holding the lock.
dma_fence_is_signaled() has the benefit of checking the
DMA_FENCE_FLAG_SIGNALED_BIT prior to calling dma_fence_signal() and so
avoids most of that contention.
