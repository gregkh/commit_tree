leds: pca955x: Add an IBM software implementation of the PCA9552 chip

IBM created an implementation of the PCA9552 on a PIC16F
microcontroller. The I2C device addresses are different from the
hardware PCA9552, so add a new compatible string and associated
platform data to be able to probe this device.
