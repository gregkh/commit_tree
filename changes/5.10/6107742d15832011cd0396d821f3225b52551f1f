tracing: support "bool" type in synthetic trace events

It's common [1] to define tracepoint fields as "bool" when they contain
a true / false value. Currently, defining a synthetic event with a
"bool" field yields EINVAL. It's possible to work around this by using
e.g. u8 (assuming sizeof(bool) is 1, and bool is unsigned; if either of
these properties don't match, you get EINVAL [2]).

Supporting "bool" explicitly makes hooking this up easier and more
portable for userspace.
