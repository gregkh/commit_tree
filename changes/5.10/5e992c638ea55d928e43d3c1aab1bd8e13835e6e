selftests: arm64: Add stress tests for FPSMID and SVE context switching

Add programs sve-test and fpsimd-test which spin reading and writing to
the SVE and FPSIMD registers, verifying the operations they perform. The
intended use is to leave them running to stress the context switch code's
handling of these registers which isn't compatible with what kselftest
does so they're not integrated into the framework but there's no other
obvious testsuite where they fit so let's store them here.

These tests were written by Dave Martin and lightly adapted by me.
