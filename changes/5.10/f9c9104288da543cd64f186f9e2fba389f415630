null_blk: Fix zone reset all tracing

In the cae of the REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET_ALL operation, the command sector is
ignored and the operation is applied to all sequential zones. For these
commands, tracing the effect of the command using the command sector to
determine the target zone is thus incorrect.

Fix null_zone_mgmt() zone condition tracing in the case of
REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET_ALL to apply tracing to all sequential zones that are
not already empty.
