powerpc: Only include kup-radix.h for 64-bit Book3S

In kup.h we currently include kup-radix.h for all 64-bit builds, which
includes Book3S and Book3E. The latter doesn't make sense, Book3E
never uses the Radix MMU.

This has worked up until now, but almost by accident, and the recent
uaccess flush changes introduced a build breakage on Book3E because of
the bad structure of the code.

So disentangle things so that we only use kup-radix.h for Book3S. This
requires some more stubs in kup.h and fixing an include in
syscall_64.c.
