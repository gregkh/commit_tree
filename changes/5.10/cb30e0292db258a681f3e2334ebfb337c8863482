interconnect: qcom: Add support for per-BCM scaling factors

Currently, bcm-voter always assumes requests are made in KBps and that
BCM HW always wants them in Bps, so it always scales the requests by
1000. However, certain use cases and BCMs may use different units.
Thus, add support for BCM-specific scaling factors.
