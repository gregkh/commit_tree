vfio/pci: Don't regenerate vconfig for all BARs if !bardirty

Now we regenerate vconfig for all the BARs via vfio_bar_fixup(), every
time any offset of any of them are read.  Though BARs aren't re-read
regularly, the regeneration can be avoided if no BARs had been written
since they were last read, in which case vdev->bardirty is false.

Let's return immediately in vfio_bar_fixup() if bardirty is false.
