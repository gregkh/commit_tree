RDMA/cma: Fix locking for the RDMA_CM_LISTEN state

There is a strange unlocked read of the ID state when checking for
reuseaddr. This is because an ID cannot be reusable once it becomes a
listening ID. Instead of using the state to exclude reuse, just clear it
as part of rdma_listen()'s flow to convert reusable into not reusable.

Once a ID goes to listen there is no way back out, and the only use of
reusable is on the bind_list check.

Finally, update the checks under handler_mutex to use READ_ONCE and audit
that once RDMA_CM_LISTEN is observed in a req callback it is stable under
the handler_mutex.
