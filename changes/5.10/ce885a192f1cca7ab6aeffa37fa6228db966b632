can: flexcan: add ISO CAN FD feature support

ISO CAN FD is introduced to increase the failture detection capability
than non-ISO CAN FD. The non-ISO CAN FD is still supported by FlexCAN so
that it can be used mainly during an intermediate phase, for evaluation
and development purposes.

Therefore, it is strongly recommended to configure FlexCAN to the ISO
CAN FD protocol by setting the ISOCANFDEN field in the CTRL2 register.

NOTE: If you only set "fd on", driver will use ISO FD mode by default.
You should set "fd-non-iso on" after setting "fd on" if you want to use
NON ISO FD mode.
