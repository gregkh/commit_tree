leds: pca9532: correct shift computation in pca9532_getled

Each led setting occupies two bits in a corresponding led register.
Accessing these bits requires shifting and masking, which was
implemented incorrectly in pca9532_getled. Two new helper macros
concentrate the computation of those masks in one place.
