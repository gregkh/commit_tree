arm64/smp: Move rcu_cpu_starting() earlier

The call to rcu_cpu_starting() in secondary_start_kernel() is not early
enough in the CPU-hotplug onlining process, which results in lockdep
splats as follows:

 WARNING: suspicious RCU usage
 -----------------------------
 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:3497 RCU-list traversed in non-reader section!!

 other info that might help us debug this:

 RCU used illegally from offline CPU!
 rcu_scheduler_active = 1, debug_locks = 1
 no locks held by swapper/1/0.

 Call trace:
  dump_backtrace+0x0/0x3c8

This is avoided by moving the call to rcu_cpu_starting up near the
beginning of the secondary_start_kernel() function.
