efi/libstub: arm32: Base FDT and initrd placement on image address

The way we use the base of DRAM in the EFI stub is problematic as it
is ill defined what the base of DRAM actually means. There are some
restrictions on the placement of FDT and initrd which are defined in
terms of dram_base, but given that the placement of the kernel in
memory is what defines these boundaries (as on ARM, this is where the
linear region starts), it is better to use the image address in these
cases, and disregard dram_base altogether.
