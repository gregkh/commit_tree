ASoC: SOF: Intel: add build support for SoundWire

Select SoundWire capabilities on newer Intel platforms, starting with
CannonLake/CoffeeLake/CometLake.

As done for HDaudio, the SoundWire link is an opt-in capability. We
explicitly test for ACPI to avoid warnings on unmet dependencies on
the SoundWire side.
