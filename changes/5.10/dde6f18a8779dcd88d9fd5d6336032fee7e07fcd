ocxl: Don't return trigger page when allocating an interrupt

Existing users of ocxl_link_irq_alloc() have been converted to obtain
the trigger page of an interrupt through xive directly, we therefore
have no need to return the trigger page when allocating an interrupt.

It also allows ocxl to use the xive native interface to allocate
interrupts, instead of its custom service.
