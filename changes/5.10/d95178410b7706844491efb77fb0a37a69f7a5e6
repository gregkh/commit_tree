iocost: recalculate delay after debt reduction

Debt sets the initial delay duration which is decayed over time. The current
debt reduction halved the debt but didn't change the delay. It prevented
future debts from increasing delay but didn't do anything to lower the
existing delay, limiting the mechanism's ability to reduce unnecessary
idling.

Reset iocg->delay to 0 after debt reduction so that iocg_kick_waitq()
recalculates new delay value based on the reduced debt amount.
