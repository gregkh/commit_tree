KVM: x86/mmu: Avoid modulo operator on 64-bit value to fix i386 build

Replace a modulo operator with the more common pattern for computing the
gfn "offset" of a huge page to fix an i386 build error.

  arch/x86/kvm/mmu/tdp_mmu.c:212: undefined reference to `__umoddi3'

In fact, almost all of tdp_mmu.c can be elided on 32-bit builds, but
that is a much larger patch.
