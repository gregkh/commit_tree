MIPS: cpu-probe: ingenic: Fix broken BUG_ON

The previous code was doing:
BUG_ON(!__builtin_constant_p(cpu_has_counter) || cpu_has_counter);

This only worked as the "cpu_has_counter" macro was overridden in
<cpu-feature-overrides.h>. The default "cpu_has_counter" macro is
non-constant, which triggered the BUG_ON() independently of the value
returned by the macro.

What we want to check here, is that *if* the macro was overridden to a
compile-time constant, then must be defined to zero, otherwise it's a
bug.

So the correct check is:
BUG_ON(__builtin_constant_p(cpu_has_counter) && cpu_has_counter);
