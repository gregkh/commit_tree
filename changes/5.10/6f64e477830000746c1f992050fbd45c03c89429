bpf: Update verification logic for LSM programs

The current logic checks if the name of the BTF type passed in
attach_btf_id starts with "bpf_lsm_", this is not sufficient as it also
allows attachment to non-LSM hooks like the very function that performs
this check, i.e. bpf_lsm_verify_prog.

In order to ensure that this verification logic allows attachment to
only LSM hooks, the LSM_HOOK definitions in lsm_hook_defs.h are used to
generate a BTF_ID set. Upon verification, the attach_btf_id of the
program being attached is checked for presence in this set.
