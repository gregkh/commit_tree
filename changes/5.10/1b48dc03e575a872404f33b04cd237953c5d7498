vhost: vdpa: report iova range

This patch introduces a new ioctl for vhost-vdpa device that can
report the iova range by the device.

For device that implements get_iova_range() method, we fetch it from
the vDPA device. If device doesn't implement get_iova_range() but
depends on platform IOMMU, we will query via DOMAIN_ATTR_GEOMETRY,
otherwise [0, ULLONG_MAX] is assumed.

For safety, this patch also rules out the map request which is not in
the valid range.
