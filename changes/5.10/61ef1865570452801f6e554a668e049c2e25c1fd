mm: factor find_get_incore_page out of mincore_page

Patch series "Return head pages from find_*_entry", v2.

This patch series started out as part of the THP patch set, but it has
some nice effects along the way and it seems worth splitting it out and
submitting separately.

Currently find_get_entry() and find_lock_entry() return the page
corresponding to the requested index, but the first thing most callers do
is find the head page, which we just threw away.  As part of auditing all
the callers, I found some misuses of the APIs and some plain
inefficiencies that I've fixed.

The diffstat is unflattering, but I added more kernel-doc and a new wrapper.

This patch (of 8);

Provide this functionality from the swap cache.  It's useful for
more than just mincore().
