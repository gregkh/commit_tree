drm/amd/powerplay: revise the outputs layout of amdgpu_pm_info debugfs

The current outputs of amdgpu_pm_info debugfs come with clock gating
status and followed by current clock/power information. However the
clock gating status retrieving may pull GFX out of CG status. That
will make the succeeding clock/power information retrieving inaccurate.

To overcome this and be with minimum impact, the outputs are updated
to show current clock/power information first.
