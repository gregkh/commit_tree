x86/static_call: Add out-of-line static call implementation

Add the x86 out-of-line static call implementation.  For each key, a
permanent trampoline is created which is the destination for all static
calls for the given key.  The trampoline has a direct jump which gets
patched by static_call_update() when the destination function changes.

[peterz: fixed trampoline, rewrote patching code]
