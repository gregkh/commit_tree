ath10k: Add new api to support TID specific configuration

This patch add ops for set_tid_config to support TID
specific configuration. Station specific TID configuration
will have more priority than vif specific TID configuration.
WMI_SERVICE_PEER_TID_CONFIGS_SUPPORT service flag introduced
to notify host for TID config support. And RTS_CTS extended tid
configuration support advertised through the service flag
WMI_10_4_SERVICE_EXT_PEER_TID_CONFIGS_SUPPORT.

TID specific noack configuration requires
aggregation should be disabled and rate for the data TID packets
should be basic rates. So, if the TID already configured
with noack policy then driver will ignore the aggregation
or TX rate related configuration for the same data TID.

In TX rate configuration should be applied with highest
preamble configuration(HT rates should not be applied
for the station which supports vht rates).
