net: ipw2x00,iwlegacy,iwlwifi: Remove in_interrupt() from debug macros

The usage of in_interrupt() in non-core code is phased out.

The debugging macros in these drivers use in_interrupt() to print 'I' or
'U' depending on the return value of in_interrupt(). While 'U' is confusing
at best and 'I' is not really describing the actual context (hard interupt,
soft interrupt, bottom half disabled section) these debug macros originate
from the pre ftrace kernel era and their value today is questionable. They
probably should be removed completely.

The macros weere added initially for ipw2100 and then spreaded when the
driver was forked.

Remove the in_interrupt() usage at least..
