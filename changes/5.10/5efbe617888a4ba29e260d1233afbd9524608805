net/mlx5: Fix dereference on pointer attr after null check

When removing a flow from the slow path fdb, a flow attr struct is
allocated for the rule removal process. If the allocation fails the
code prints a warning message but continues with the removal flow
which include dereferencing a pointer which could be null.
Fix this by exiting the function in case the attr allocation failed.
