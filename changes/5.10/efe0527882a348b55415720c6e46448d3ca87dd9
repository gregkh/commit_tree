l2tp: remove header length param from l2tp_xmit_skb

All callers pass the session structure's hdr_len field as the header
length parameter to l2tp_xmit_skb.

Since we're passing a pointer to the session structure to l2tp_xmit_skb
anyway, there's not much point breaking the header length out as a
separate argument.
