drm: mxsfb: Move vblank event arm to CRTC .atomic_flush()

The vblank event is armed in the plane .atomic_update(). This works fine
as we have a single plane, and was the only option when the driver was
using the drm_simple_kms_helper helper, but will break as soon as
multiple planes are supported. Move it to CRTC .atomic_flush().
