iio: gyro: adxrs290: Add triggered buffer support

Provide a way for continuous data capture by setting up buffer support. The
data ready signal exposed at the SYNC pin of the ADXRS290 is exploited as
a hardware interrupt which triggers to fill the buffer.

Triggered buffer setup was tested with both hardware trigger (DATA_RDY) and
software triggers (sysfs-trig & hrtimer).
