bcache: don't check seq numbers in register_cache_set()

In order to update the partial super block of cache set, the seq numbers
of cache and cache set are checked in register_cache_set(). If cache's
seq number is larger than cache set's seq number, cache set must update
its partial super block from cache's super block. It is unncessary when
the embedded struct cache_sb is removed from struct cache set.

This patch removed the seq numbers checking from register_cache_set(),
because later there will be no such partial super block in struct cache
set, the cache set will directly reference in-memory super block from
struct cache. This is a preparation patch for removing embedded struct
cache_sb from struct cache_set.
