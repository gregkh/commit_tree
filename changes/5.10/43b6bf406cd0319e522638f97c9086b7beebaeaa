spi: imx: fix runtime pm support for !CONFIG_PM

525c9e5a32bd introduced pm_runtime support for the i.MX SPI driver. With
this pm_runtime is used to bring up the clocks initially. When CONFIG_PM
is disabled the clocks are no longer enabled and the driver doesn't work
anymore. Fix this by enabling the clocks in the probe function and
telling pm_runtime that the device is active using
pm_runtime_set_active().
