spi: dw: Detach SPI device specific CR0 config method

Indeed there is no point in detecting the SPI peripheral device parameters
and initializing the CR0 register fields each time an SPI transfer is
executed. Instead let's define a dedicated CR0 chip-data member, which
will be initialized in accordance with the SPI device settings at the
moment of setting it up.

By doing so we'll finally make the SPI device chip_data serving as it's
supposed to - to preserve the SPI device specific DW SPI configuration.
See spi-fsl-dspi.c, spi-pl022.c, spi-pxa2xx.c drivers for example of the
way the chip data is utilized.
