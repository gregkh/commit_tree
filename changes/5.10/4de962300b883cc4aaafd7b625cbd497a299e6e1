drm/i915: Use fb->format->is_yuv for the g4x+ sprite RGB vs. YUV check

g4x+ sprites have an extra cdclk limitation listed for RGB formats.
For some random reason I chose to use cpp>=4 as the check for that.
While that does actually work let's deobfuscate it by checking
for !is_yuv instead. I suspect is_yuv didn't exist way back when
I originally write the code.

Also drop the duplicate comment.
