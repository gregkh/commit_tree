iio: buffer: split buffer sysfs creation to take buffer as primary arg

Currently the iio_buffer_{alloc,free}_sysfs_and_mask() take 'indio_dev' as
primary argument. This change splits the main logic into a private function
that takes an IIO buffer as primary argument.

That way, the functions can be extended to configure the sysfs for multiple
buffers.
