scsi: pm80xx: Increase number of supported queues

Current driver uses fixed number of Inbound and Outbound queues and all of
the I/O, TMF and internal requests are submitted through those. A global
spin lock is used to control the shared access. This can create a lock
contention and it is real bottleneck in the I/O path.

To avoid this, the number of supported Inbound and Outbound queues is
increased to 64, and the number of queues used is decided based on number
of CPU cores online and number of MSI-X vectors allocated. Also add locks
per queue instead of using the global lock.
