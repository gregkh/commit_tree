bpf, selftests: Fix warning in snprintf_btf where system() call unchecked

On my systems system() calls are marked with warn_unused_result
apparently. So without error checking we get this warning,

./prog_tests/snprintf_btf.c:30:9: warning: ignoring return value
   of ‘system’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result[-Wunused-result]

Also it seems like a good idea to check the return value anyways
to ensure ping exists even if its seems unlikely.
