tty: n_gsm, eliminate indirection for gsm->{output,error}()

gsm->output and ->error are set only to gsmld_output and gsm_error,
respectively. Call these functions directly and remove error and output
function pointers from struct gsm_mux completely.

Note: we need a forward declaration of gsmld_output now.
