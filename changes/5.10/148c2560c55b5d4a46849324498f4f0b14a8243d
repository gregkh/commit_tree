gpio: mockup: pass the chip label as device property

While we do check the "chip-name" property in probe(), we never actually
use it. Let's pass the chip label to the driver using device properties
as we'll want to allow users to define their own once dynamically
created chips are supported.

The property is renamed to "chip-label" to not cause any confusion with
the actual chip name which is of the form: "gpiochipX".

If the "chip-label" property is missing, let's do what most devices in
drivers/gpio/ do and use dev_name().
