btrfs: split and refactor btrfs_sysfs_remove_devices_dir

Similar to btrfs_sysfs_add_devices_dir()'s refactoring, split
btrfs_sysfs_remove_devices_dir() so that we don't have to use the device
argument to indicate whether to free all devices or just one device.

Export btrfs_sysfs_remove_device() as device operations outside of
sysfs.c now calls this instead of btrfs_sysfs_remove_devices_dir().

btrfs_sysfs_remove_devices_dir() is renamed to
btrfs_sysfs_remove_fs_devices() to suite its new role.

Now, no one outside of sysfs.c calls btrfs_sysfs_remove_fs_devices()
so it is redeclared s static. And the same function had to be moved
before its first caller.
