scsi: core: Only re-run queue in scsi_end_request() if device queue is busy

The request queue is currently run unconditionally in scsi_end_request() if
both target queue and host queue are ready.

Recently Long Li reported that cost of a queue run can be very heavy in
case of high queue depth. Improve this situation by only running the
request queue when this LUN is busy.
