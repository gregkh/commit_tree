rcutorture: Properly set rcu_fwds for OOM handling

The conversion of rcu_fwds to dynamic allocation failed to actually
allocate the required structure.  This commit therefore allocates it,
frees it, and updates rcu_fwds accordingly.  While in the area, it
abstracts the cleanup actions into rcu_torture_fwd_prog_cleanup().
