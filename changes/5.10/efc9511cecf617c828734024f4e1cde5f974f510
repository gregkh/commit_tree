selftests/vm: fix false build success on the second and later attempts

Patch series "selftests/vm: fix some minor aggravating factors in the Makefile".

This fixes a couple of minor aggravating factors that I ran across while
trying to do some changes in selftests/vm.  These are simple things, but
like most things with GNU Make, it's rarely obvious what's wrong until you
understand *the entire Makefile and all of its includes*.

So while there is, of course, joy in learning those details, I thought I'd
fix these little things, so as to allow others to skip out on the Joy if
they so choose.  :)

First of all, if you have an item (let's choose userfaultfd for an
example) that fails to build, you might do this:

$ make -j32

    # ...you observe a failed item in the threaded output

# OK, let's get a closer look

$ make
    # ...but now the build quietly "succeeds".

That's what Patch 0001 fixes.

Second, if you instead attempt this approach for your closer look (a casual
mistake, as it's not supported):

$ make userfaultfd

    # ...userfaultfd fails to link, due to incomplete LDLIBS

That's what Patch 0002 fixes.

This patch (of 2):

If one or more of these selftest fail to build, then after the first
failure, subsequent invocations of "make" will make it appear that there
are no build failures, after all.

That's because the failed build products remain, with up-to-date
timestamps, thus tricking Make (and you!) into believing that there's
nothing else to build.

Fix this by telling Make to delete targets that didn't completely
succeed.
