usb: typec: tcpci: update ROLE_CONTROL for DRP

ROLE_CONTROL register would not have the actual CC terminations
unless the port does not set ROLE_CONTROL.DRP. For DRP ports,
CC_STATUS.cc1/cc2 indicates the final terminations applied
when TCPC enters potential_connect_as_source/_sink.
For DRP ports, infer port role from CC_STATUS and set corresponding
CC terminations before setting the orientation.
