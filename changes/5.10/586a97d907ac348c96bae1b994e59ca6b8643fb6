i2c: tegra: Use clk-bulk helpers

Use clk-bulk helpers and factor out clocks initialization into separate
function in order to make code cleaner.

The clocks initialization now performed after reset-control initialization
in order to avoid a noisy -PROBE_DEFER errors on T186+ from the clk-bulk
helper which doesn't silence this error code. Hence reset_control_get()
now may return -EPROBE_DEFER on newer Tegra SoCs because they use BPMP
driver that provides reset controls and BPMP doesn't come up early during
boot. Previously rst was protected by the clocks retrieval and now this
patch makes dev_err_probe() to be used for the rst error handling.
