kdb: remove unnecessary null check of dbg_io_ops

`kdb_msg_write` operates on a global `struct kgdb_io *` called
`dbg_io_ops`.

It's initialized in `debug_core.c` and checked throughout the debug
flow.

There's a null check in `kdb_msg_write` which triggers static analyzers
and gives the (almost entirely wrong) impression that it can be null.

Coverity scanner caught this as CID 1465042.

I have removed the unnecessary null check and eliminated false-positive
forward null dereference warning.
