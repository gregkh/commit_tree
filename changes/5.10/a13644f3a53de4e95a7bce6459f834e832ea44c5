x86/entry/64: Add entry code for #VC handler

The #VC handler needs special entry code because:

	1. It runs on an IST stack

	2. It needs to be able to handle nested #VC exceptions

To make this work, the entry code is implemented to pretend it doesn't
use an IST stack. When entered from user-mode or early SYSCALL entry
path it switches to the task stack. If entered from kernel-mode it tries
to switch back to the previous stack in the IRET frame.

The stack found in the IRET frame is validated first, and if it is not
safe to use it for the #VC handler, the code will switch to a
fall-back stack (the #VC2 IST stack). From there, it can cause nested
exceptions again.
