igc: Clean RX descriptor error flags

i225 advanced receive descriptor doesn't have the following extend error
bits: CE, SE, SEQ, CXE. In addition to that, the bit TCPE is called L4E
in the datasheet.

Clean up the code accordingly, and get rid of the macro
IGC_RXDEXT_ERR_FRAME_ERR_MASK since it doesn't make much sense anymore.
