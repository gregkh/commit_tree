devlink: Add reload action option to devlink reload command

Add devlink reload action to allow the user to request a specific reload
action. The action parameter is optional, if not specified then devlink
driver re-init action is used (backward compatible).
Note that when required to do firmware activation some drivers may need
to reload the driver. On the other hand some drivers may need to reset
the firmware to reinitialize the driver entities. Therefore, the devlink
reload command returns the actions which were actually performed.
Reload actions supported are:
driver_reinit: driver entities re-initialization, applying devlink-param
               and devlink-resource values.
fw_activate: firmware activate.

command examples:
$devlink dev reload pci/0000:82:00.0 action driver_reinit
reload_actions_performed:
  driver_reinit

$devlink dev reload pci/0000:82:00.0 action fw_activate
reload_actions_performed:
  driver_reinit fw_activate
