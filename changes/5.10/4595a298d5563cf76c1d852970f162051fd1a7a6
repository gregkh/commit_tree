iomap: Set all uptodate bits for an Uptodate page

For filesystems with block size < page size, we need to set all the
per-block uptodate bits if the page was already uptodate at the time
we create the per-block metadata.  This can happen if the page is
invalidated (eg by a write to drop_caches) but ultimately not removed
from the page cache.

This is a data corruption issue as page writeback skips blocks which
are marked !uptodate.
