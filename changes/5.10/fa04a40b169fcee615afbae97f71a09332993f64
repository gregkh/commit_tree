afs: Fix to take ref on page when PG_private is set

Fix afs to take a ref on a page when it sets PG_private on it and to drop
the ref when removing the flag.

Note that in afs_write_begin(), a lot of the time, PG_private is already
set on a page to which we're going to add some data.  In such a case, we
leave the bit set and mustn't increment the page count.

As suggested by Matthew Wilcox, use attach/detach_page_private() where
possible.
