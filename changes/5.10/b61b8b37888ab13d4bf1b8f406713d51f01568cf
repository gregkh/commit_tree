soundwire: intel: reset pm_runtime status during system resume

The system resume does the entire bus re-initialization and brings it
to full-power. If the device was pm_runtime suspended, there is no
need to run the pm_runtime resume sequence after the system runtime.

Follow the documentation from runtime_pm.rst, and conditionally
disable, set_active and re-enable the device on system resume.

Note that pm_runtime_suspended() is used instead of
pm_runtime_status_suspended() so that we can deal with the case where
pm_runtime is disabled.
