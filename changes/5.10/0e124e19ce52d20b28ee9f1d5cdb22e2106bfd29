drm/i915/gem: Propagate error from cancelled submit due to context closure

In the course of discovering and closing many races with context closure
and execbuf submission, since commit 61231f6bd056 ("drm/i915/gem: Check
that the context wasn't closed during setup") we started checking that
the context was not closed by another userspace thread during the execbuf
ioctl. In doing so we cancelled the inflight request (by telling it to be
skipped), but kept reporting success since we do submit a request, albeit
one that doesn't execute. As the error is known before we return from the
ioctl, we can report the error we detect immediately, rather than leave
it on the fence status. With the immediate propagation of the error, it
is easier for userspace to handle.
