net/mlx5: Refactor query port speed functions

The functions mlx5_query_port_link_width_oper and
mlx5_query_port_ib_proto_oper are always called together, so combine them
to a new function called mlx5_query_port_oper to avoid duplication.

And while the mlx5i_get_port_settings is the same as
mlx5_query_port_oper therefore let's remove it.

According to the IB spec link_width_oper and ib_proto_oper should be u16
and not as written u8, so perform casting as a preparation to cross-RDMA
patch which will fix that type for all drivers in the RDMA subsystem.
