kcsan: Optimize debugfs stats counters

Remove kcsan_counter_inc/dec() functions, as they perform no other
logic, and are no longer needed.

This avoids several calls in kcsan_setup_watchpoint() and
kcsan_found_watchpoint(), as well as lets the compiler warn us about
potential out-of-bounds accesses as the array's size is known at all
usage sites at compile-time.
