phy: ti: am654: simplify regfield handling

regfield handling in current driver code is made complicated
by having a separate regfield variable for each field which
is allocated individually.

This quickly gets unwieldy once number of regfields increase.
Instead, use an array of regfields which are allocated in a
loop.
