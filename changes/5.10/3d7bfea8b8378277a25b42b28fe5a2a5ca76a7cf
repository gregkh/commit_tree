unicode: Add utf8_casefold_hash

This adds a case insensitive hash function to allow taking the hash
without needing to allocate a casefolded copy of the string.

The existing d_hash implementations for casefolding allocate memory
within rcu-walk, by avoiding it we can be more efficient and avoid
worrying about a failed allocation.
