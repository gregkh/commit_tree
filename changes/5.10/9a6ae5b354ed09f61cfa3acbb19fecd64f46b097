drm/i915: panel: Honor the VBT PWM min setting for devs with an external PWM controller

So far for devices using an external PWM controller (devices using
pwm_setup_backlight()), we have been hardcoding the minimum allowed
PWM level to 0. But several of these devices specify a non 0 minimum
setting in their VBT.

Change pwm_setup_backlight() to use get_backlight_min_vbt() to get
the minimum level.
