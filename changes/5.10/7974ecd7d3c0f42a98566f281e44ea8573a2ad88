usb: gadget: f_ncm: allow using NCM in SuperSpeed Plus gadgets.

Currently, enabling f_ncm at SuperSpeed Plus speeds results in an
oops in config_ep_by_speed because ncm_set_alt passes in NULL
ssp_descriptors. Fix this by re-using the SuperSpeed descriptors.
This is safe because usb_assign_descriptors calls
usb_copy_descriptors.

Tested: enabled f_ncm on a dwc3 gadget and 10Gbps link, ran iperf
