ext4: implement swap_activate aops using iomap

After moving ext4's bmap to iomap interface, swapon functionality
on files created using fallocate (which creates unwritten extents) are
failing. This is since iomap_bmap interface returns 0 for unwritten
extents and thus generic_swapfile_activate considers this as holes
and hence bail out with below kernel msg :-

[340.915835] swapon: swapfile has holes

To fix this we need to implement ->swap_activate aops in ext4
which will use ext4_iomap_report_ops. Since we only need to return
the list of extents so ext4_iomap_report_ops should be enough.
