wcn36xx: Define wcn3680 specific firmware parameters

This commit defines a firmware configuration for the wcn3680 which
represents a working downstream configuration. This configuration has been
successfully applied to the upstream driver with antecedent patches
resulting in the same or better through-put in comparison to the
downstream driver on the test hardware.
