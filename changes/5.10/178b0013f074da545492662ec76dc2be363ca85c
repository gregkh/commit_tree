drm/amdgpu/dc: Stop dma_resv_lock inversion in commit_tail

Trying to grab dma_resv_lock while in commit_tail before we've done
all the code that leads to the eventual signalling of the vblank event
(which can be a dma_fence) is deadlock-y. Don't do that.

Here the solution is easy because just grabbing locks to read
something races anyway. We don't need to bother, READ_ONCE is
equivalent. And avoids the locking issue.

v2: Also take into account tmz_surface boolean, plus just delete the
old code.
