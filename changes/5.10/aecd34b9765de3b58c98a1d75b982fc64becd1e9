rcu: Restrict default jiffies_till_first_fqs for strict RCU GPs

If there are idle CPUs, RCU's grace-period kthread will wait several
jiffies before even thinking about polling them.  This promotes
efficiency, which is normally a good thing, but when the kernel
has been built with CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=y, we care more
about short grace periods.  This commit therefore restricts the
default jiffies_till_first_fqs value to zero in kernels built with
CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=y, which causes RCU's grace-period kthread
to poll for idle CPUs immediately after starting a grace period.
