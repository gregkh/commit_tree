net/mlx5e: Add support for tc trap

Support tc trap such that packets can explicitly be forwarded to slow
path if they match a specific rule.

In the example below, we want packets with src IP equals 7.7.7.8 to be
forwarded to software, in which case it will get to the appropriate
representor net device.

$ tc filter add dev eth1 protocol ip prio 1 root flower skip_sw \
    src_ip 7.7.7.8 action trap
