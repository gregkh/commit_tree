x86/boot: Remove run-time relocations from head_{32,64}.S

The BFD linker generates run-time relocations for z_input_len and
z_output_len, even though they are absolute symbols.

This is fixed for binutils-2.35 [1]. Work around this for earlier
versions by defining two variables input_len and output_len in addition
to the symbols, and use them via position-independent references.

This eliminates the last two run-time relocations in the head code and
allows us to drop the -z noreloc-overflow flag to the linker.

Move the -pie and --no-dynamic-linker LDFLAGS to LDFLAGS_vmlinux instead
of KBUILD_LDFLAGS. There shouldn't be anything else getting linked, but
this is the more logical location for these flags, and modversions might
call the linker if an EXPORT_SYMBOL is left over accidentally in one of
the decompressors.
