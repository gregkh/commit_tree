ice: convert to new udp_tunnel infrastructure

Convert ice to the new infra, use share port tables.

Leave a tiny bit more error checking in place than usual,
because this driver really does quite a bit of magic.

We need to calculate the number of VxLAN and GENEVE entries
the firmware has reserved.

Thanks to the conversion the driver will no longer sleep in
an atomic section.
