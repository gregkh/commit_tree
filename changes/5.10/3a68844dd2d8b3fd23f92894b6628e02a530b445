net: dsa: Utilize __vlan_find_dev_deep_rcu()

Now that we are guaranteed that dsa_untag_bridge_pvid() is called after
eth_type_trans() we can utilize __vlan_find_dev_deep_rcu() which will
take care of finding an 802.1Q upper on top of a bridge master.

A common use case, prior to 12a1526d067 ("net: dsa: untag the bridge
pvid from rx skbs") was to configure a bridge 802.1Q upper like this:

ip link add name br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 0
ip link add link br0 name br0.1 type vlan id 1

in order to pop the default_pvid VLAN tag.

With this change we restore that behavior while still allowing the DSA
receive path to automatically pop the VLAN tag.
