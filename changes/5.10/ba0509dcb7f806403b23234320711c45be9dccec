perf dso: Use libbfd to read build_id and .gnu_debuglink section

Wine generates PE binaries for most of its modules and perf is unable to
parse these files to get build_id or .gnu_debuglink section.

Using libbfd when available, instead of libelf, makes it possible to
resolve debug file location regardless of the dso binary format.

Committer notes:

Made the filename__read_build_id() variant that uses abfd->build_id
depend on the feature test that defines HAVE_LIBBFD_BUILDID_SUPPORT, to
get this to continue building with older libbfd/binutils.
