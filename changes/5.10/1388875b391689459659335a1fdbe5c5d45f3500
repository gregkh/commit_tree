bnxt_en: Add stored FW version info to devlink info_get cb.

This patch adds FW versions stored in the flash to devlink info_get
callback.  Return the correct fw.psid running version using the
newly added bp->nvm_cfg_ver.

v2:
Ensure stored pkg_name string is NULL terminated when copied to
devlink.

Return directly from the last call to bnxt_dl_info_put().

If the FW call to get stored version fails for any reason, return
success immediately to devlink without the stored versions.
