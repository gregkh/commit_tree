powerpc: PPC_SECURE_BOOT should not require PowerNV

In commit 61f879d97ce4 ("powerpc/pseries: Detect secure and trusted
boot state of the system.") we taught the kernel how to understand the
secure-boot parameters used by a pseries guest.

However, CONFIG_PPC_SECURE_BOOT still requires PowerNV. I didn't
catch this because pseries_le_defconfig includes support for
PowerNV and so everything still worked. Indeed, most configs will.
Nonetheless, technically PPC_SECURE_BOOT doesn't require PowerNV
any more.

The secure variables support (PPC_SECVAR_SYSFS) doesn't do anything
on pSeries yet, but I don't think it's worth adding a new condition -
at some stage we'll want to add a backend for pSeries anyway.
