xsk: Move fill and completion rings to buffer pool

Move the fill and completion rings from the umem to the buffer
pool. This so that we in a later commit can share the umem
between multiple HW queue ids. In this case, we need one fill and
completion ring per queue id. As the buffer pool is per queue id
and napi id this is a natural place for it and one umem
struture can be shared between these buffer pools.
