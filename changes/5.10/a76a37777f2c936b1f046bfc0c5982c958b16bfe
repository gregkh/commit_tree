iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Ensure queue is read after updating prod pointer

Reading the 'prod' MMIO register in order to determine whether or not
there is valid data beyond 'cons' for a given queue does not provide
sufficient dependency ordering, as the resulting access is address
dependent only on 'cons' and can therefore be speculated ahead of time,
potentially allowing stale data to be read by the CPU.

Use readl() instead of readl_relaxed() when updating the shadow copy of
the 'prod' pointer, so that all speculated memory reads from the
corresponding queue can occur only from valid slots.

[will: Use readl() instead of explicit barrier. Update 'cons' side to match.]
