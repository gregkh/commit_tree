iio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: fix DMA conversion crash

After the move of the postenable code to preenable, the DMA start was
done before the DMA init, which is not correct.
The DMA is initialized in set_watermark. Because of this, we need to call
the DMA start functions in set_watermark, after the DMA init, instead of
preenable hook, when the DMA is not properly setup yet.
