gfs2: enhance log_blocks trace point to show log blocks free

This patch adds some code to enhance the log_blocks trace point. It
reports the number of free log blocks. This makes the trace point much
more useful, especially for debugging performance problems when we can
tell when the journal gets full and needs to wait for flushes, etc.
