usb: bdc: remove duplicated error message

in case devm_platform_ioremap_resource() fails, that function already
prints a relevant error message which renders the driver's dev_err()
redundant. Let's remove the unnecessary message and, while at that,
also make sure to pass along the error value returned by
devm_platform_ioremap_resource() instead of always returning -ENOMEM.
