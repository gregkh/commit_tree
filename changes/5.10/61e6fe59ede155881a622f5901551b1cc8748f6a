i2c: imx: Don't generate STOP condition if arbitration has been lost

If arbitration is lost, the master automatically changes to slave mode.
I2SR_IBB may or may not be reset by hardware. Raising a STOP condition
by resetting I2CR_MSTA has no effect and will not clear I2SR_IBB.

So calling i2c_imx_bus_busy() is not required and would busy-wait until
timeout.
