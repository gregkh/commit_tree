ext4: fix leaking sysfs kobject after failed mount

ext4_unregister_sysfs() only deletes the kobject.  The reference to it
needs to be put separately, like ext4_put_super() does.

This addresses the syzbot report
"memory leak in kobject_set_name_vargs (3)"
(https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9f864abad79fae7c17e1).
