media: staging: rkisp1: params: upon stream stop, iterate a local list to return the buffers

The code in '.stop_streaming' callback releases and acquire the lock
at each iteration when returning the buffers.
Holding the lock disables interrupts so it should be minimized.
To make the code cleaner and still minimize holding the lock,
the buffer list is first moved to a local list and
then can be iterated without the lock.
