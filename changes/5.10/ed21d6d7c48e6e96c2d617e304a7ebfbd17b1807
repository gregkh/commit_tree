perf tests: Add test for PE binary format support

This adds a precompiled file in PE binary format, with split debug file,
and tries to read its build_id and .gnu_debuglink sections, as well as
looking up the main symbol from the debug file. This should succeed if
libbfd is supported.

Committer testing:

  $ perf test "PE file support"
  68: PE file support           : Ok
  $
