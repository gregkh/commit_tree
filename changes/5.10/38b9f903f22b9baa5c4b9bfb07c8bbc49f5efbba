net/mlx5: Handle sync reset request event

Once the driver gets sync_reset_request from firmware it prepares for the
coming reset and sends acknowledge.
After getting this event the driver expects device reset, either it will
trigger PCI reset on sync_reset_now event or such PCI reset will be
triggered by another PF of the same device. So it moves to reset
requested mode and if it gets PCI reset triggered by the other PF it
detect the reset and reloads.
