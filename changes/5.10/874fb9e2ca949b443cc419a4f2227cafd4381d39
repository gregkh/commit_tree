ipv4: Restore flowi4_oif update before call to xfrm_lookup_route

Tobias reported regressions in IPsec tests following the patch
referenced by the Fixes tag below. The root cause is dropping the
reset of the flowi4_oif after the fib_lookup. Apparently it is
needed for xfrm cases, so restore the oif update to ip_route_output_flow
right before the call to xfrm_lookup_route.
