nvme-fc: eliminate terminate_io use by nvme_fc_error_recovery

nvme_fc_error_recovery() special cases handling when in CONNECTING state
and calls __nvme_fc_terminate_io(). __nvme_fc_terminate_io() itself
special cases CONNECTING state and calls the routine to abort outstanding
ios.

Simplify the sequence by putting the call to abort outstanding I/Os
directly in nvme_fc_error_recovery.

Move the location of __nvme_fc_abort_outstanding_ios(), and
nvme_fc_terminate_exchange() which is called by it, to avoid adding
function prototypes for nvme_fc_error_recovery().
