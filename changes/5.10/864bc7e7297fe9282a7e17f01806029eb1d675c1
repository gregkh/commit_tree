usb: gadget: config_ep_by_speed_and_alt instead of config_ep_by_speed

This patch replace config_ep_by_speed with config_ep_by_speed_and_alt.
This change allows to select proper usb_ss_ep_comp_descriptor for each
stream capable endpoints.

f_tcm function for SS use array of headers for both BOT/UAS alternate
setting:

static struct usb_descriptor_header *uasp_ss_function_desc[] = {
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &bot_intf_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_ss_bi_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &bot_bi_ep_comp_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_ss_bo_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &bot_bo_ep_comp_desc,

        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_intf_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_ss_bi_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_bi_ep_comp_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_bi_pipe_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_ss_bo_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_bo_ep_comp_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_bo_pipe_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_ss_status_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_status_in_ep_comp_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_status_pipe_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_ss_cmd_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_cmd_comp_desc,
        (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uasp_cmd_pipe_desc,
        NULL,
};

The first 5 descriptors are associated with BOT alternate setting,
and others are associated with UAS.

During handling UAS alternate setting f_tcm driver invokes
config_ep_by_speed and this function sets incorrect companion endpoint
descriptor in usb_ep object.

Instead setting ep->comp_desc to uasp_bi_ep_comp_desc function in this
case set ep->comp_desc to bot_uasp_ss_bi_desc.

And in result it uses the descriptor from BOT alternate setting
instead UAS.

Finally, it causes that controller driver during enabling endpoints
detect that just enabled endpoint for bot.
