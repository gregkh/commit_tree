interconnect: qcom: use icc_sync state for sm8[12]50

In addition to the rest of Qcom interconnect drivers use icc_sync_state
for SM8150/SM8250 interconnect drivers to notify the interconnect
framework when all consumers are probed and there is no need to keep the
bandwidth set to maximum anymore.

Also move the BCM initialization before creating the nodes to set the
max bandwidth in hardware for the initialization/probing stage.
