Input: allocate keycode for Fn + right shift

The last 2 generations of Lenovo Thinkpads send an acpi_thinkpad event when
Fn + right shift is pressed.  This is intended for use with "Lenovo Quick
Clean" software, which disables the touchpad + kbd for 2 minutes on this
key-combo so that healthcare workes can disinfect it.

But there is no silkscreen print on the right-keyboard to indicate this,
so add a KEY_FN_RIGHT_SHIFT keycode define to use for this key-combo.
