drm/i915: Clear the repeater bit on HDCP disable

On HDCP disable, clear the repeater bit. This ensures if we connect a
non-repeater sink after a repeater, the bit is in the state we expect.

  I had previously agreed that clearing the rep_ctl bits on enable would
  also be a good idea. However when I committed that idea to code, it
  didn't look right. So let's rely on enables and disables being paired
  and everything outside of that will be considered a bug
