samples: bpf: Refactor xdp_monitor with libbpf

To avoid confusion caused by the increasing fragmentation of the BPF
Loader program, this commit would like to change to the libbpf loader
instead of using the bpf_load.

Thanks to libbpf's bpf_link interface, managing the tracepoint BPF
program is much easier. bpf_program__attach_tracepoint manages the
enable of tracepoint event and attach of BPF programs to it with a
single interface bpf_link, so there is no need to manage event_fd and
prog_fd separately.

This commit refactors xdp_monitor with using this libbpf API, and the
bpf_load is removed and migrated to libbpf.
