drm/i915/tgl: Fix stepping WA matching

TGL made stepping a litte mess, workarounds refer to the stepping of
the IP(GT or Display) not of the GPU stepping so it would already
require the same solution as used in commit 96c5a15f9f39
("drm/i915/kbl: Fix revision ID checks").
But to make things even more messy it have a different IP stepping
mapping between SKUs and the same stepping revision of GT do not match
the same HW between TGL U/Y and regular TGL.

So it was required to have 2 different macros to check GT WAs while
for Display we are able to use just one macro that uses the right
revids table.

All TGL workarounds checked and updated accordingly.

v2:
- removed TODO to check if WA 14010919138 applies to regular TGL.
- fixed display stepping in regular TGL (Anusha)
