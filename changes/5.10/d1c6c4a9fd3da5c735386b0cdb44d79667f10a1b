ASoC: SOF: support topology components on secondary cores

Currently SOF supports running pipelines on secondary DSP cores in a
limited way. This patch represents the next step in SOF multi-core DSP
support, it adds checks for core ID to individual topology components.
It takes care to power up all the requested cores. More advanced DSP
core power management should be added in the future.
