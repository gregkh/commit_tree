staging: wfx: drop useless stricts only used in hif_req_start_scan_alt

The structs hif_scan_type, hif_scan_flags and hif_auto_scan_param have
no real reasons to exist (apart maybe defining namespaces). Moreover,
the names of the fields within these structs are not all meaningful.

Drop the structs and rename the fields.
