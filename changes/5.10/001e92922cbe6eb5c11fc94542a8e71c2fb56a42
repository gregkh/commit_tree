docs: soundwire: fix some identation at stream.rst

Currently, sphinx emits one warning on this file:

	Documentation/driver-api/soundwire/stream.rst:522: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

That's due to some extra spaces before the title of a chapter.

Yet, the list afterwards is missing identation.

So, address both issues.
