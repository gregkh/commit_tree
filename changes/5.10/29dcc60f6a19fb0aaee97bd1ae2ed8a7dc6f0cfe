x86/boot/compressed/64: Add stage1 #VC handler

Add the first handler for #VC exceptions. At stage 1 there is no GHCB
yet because the kernel might still be running on the EFI page table.

The stage 1 handler is limited to the MSR-based protocol to talk to the
hypervisor and can only support CPUID exit-codes, but that is enough to
get to stage 2.

 [ bp: Zap superfluous newlines after rd/wrmsr instruction mnemonics. ]
