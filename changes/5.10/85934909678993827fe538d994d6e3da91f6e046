i2c: tegra: Use reset_control_reset()

Use a single reset_control_reset() instead of assert/deasset couple in
order to make code cleaner a tad. Note that the reset_control_reset()
uses 1 microsecond delay instead of 2 that was used previously, but this
shouldn't matter because one microsecond is a default reset time for most
of Tegra peripherals and TRM doesn't mention anything special in regards
to I2C controller's reset propagation time.

In addition don't ignore potential error of the reset control by emitting
a noisy warning if it fails, which will indicate an existence of a severe
problem, while still allow machine to boot up.
