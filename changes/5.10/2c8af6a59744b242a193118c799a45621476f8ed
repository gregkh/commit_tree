spi: hisi-sfc-v3xx: factor out IO modes configuration

Factor IO modes configuration out of hisi_sfc_v3xx_generic_exec_op()
using an IO modes lookup table. This will make the process a bit clearer
and reduce the cyclomatic complexity. Simplify the IO mode definition
macros a little bit as well.

Also add the .supports_op() method for the controller mem ops, in order
to avoid OOB access.
