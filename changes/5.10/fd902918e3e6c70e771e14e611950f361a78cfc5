media: rkvdec: Use H264_SCALING_MATRIX only when required

Baseline, Main and Extended profiles are specified to
not support a scaling matrix. Also, High profiles
can optionally specify a scaling matrix, using
SPS and PPS NAL units.

To meet this expectation, applications are required to
set the V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_H264_SCALING_MATRIX control
and set the V4L2_H264_PPS_FLAG_SCALING_MATRIX_PRESENT
flag only when a scaling matrix is specified for a picture.

Implement this on rkvdec, which has hardware support for this
case.
