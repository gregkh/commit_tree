kunit: tool: handle when .kunit exists but .kunitconfig does not

Right now .kunitconfig and the build dir are automatically created if
the build dir does not exists; however, if the build dir is present and
.kunitconfig is not, kunit_tool will crash.

Fix this by checking for both the build dir as well as the .kunitconfig.

NOTE: This depends on commit 5578d008d9e0 ("kunit: tool: fix running
kunit_tool from outside kernel tree")
