staging: media: atomisp: Convert to GPIO descriptors

Convert the atomisp LM3554 driver to use GPIO descriptors
fully. It was already retrieveing the GPIO lines as descriptors
but for some reason converting them back into global GPIO
numbers. There is no reason to do this, just deal with the
descriptors as-is.
