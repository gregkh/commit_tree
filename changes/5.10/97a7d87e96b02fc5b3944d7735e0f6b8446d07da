mmc: core: add a 'doing_init_tune' flag and a 'mmc_doing_tune' helper

Our driver needs to know when tuning is in progress. 'doing_retune' only
covers re-tuning, not the initial tuning. Add another flag to detect the
initial tuning state and add a helper which tells us if any kind of
tuning is going on. Only implemented for MMC currently because that's
where we need it. SD can be added later if it becomes necessary.
