docs: dma-buf: fix some warnings

Fix those warnings:

	Documentation/driver-api/dma-buf.rst:182: WARNING: Title underline too short.

	Indefinite DMA Fences
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Documentation/driver-api/dma-buf.rst:88: WARNING: Unknown target name: "fence poll support".

The first one is due to a shorter markup. The second one is
because the chapter name was wrong.
