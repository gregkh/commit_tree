s390/stp: add support for leap seconds

In the current implementation, leap seconds are only synchronized
during the bootup process when the STP clock is synced. If the Leap
second offset (LSO) changes the machine must be rebooted, which is
not desired. This patch adds the required code to handle Leap second
changes during runtime. If the Leap second changes, a Configuration
change machine check is triggered. The STP code than schedules a Leap
second insertion/deletion with do_adjtimex().
