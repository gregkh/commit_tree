iommu/iova: Replace cmpxchg with xchg in queue_iova

The performance of the atomic_xchg is better than atomic_cmpxchg because
no comparison is required. While the value of @fq_timer_on can only be 0
or 1. Let's use atomic_xchg instead of atomic_cmpxchg here because we
only need to check that the value changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 1.
