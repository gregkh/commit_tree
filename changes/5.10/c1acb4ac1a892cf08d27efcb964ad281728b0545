tracing: Fix out of bounds write in get_trace_buf

The nesting count of trace_printk allows for 4 levels of nesting. The
nesting counter starts at zero and is incremented before being used to
retrieve the current context's buffer. But the index to the buffer uses the
nesting counter after it was incremented, and not its original number,
which in needs to do.
