iio: accel: bma220: Drop ACPI_PTR() and accompanying ifdeffery

The driver is quite likely used only on ACPI based platforms and
rarely build with CONFIG_ACPI=n. Even though, the few dozens of bytes
is better than ugly ifdeffery and inclusion of heavy header.

As a result, replace acpi.h with mod_devicetable.h.
