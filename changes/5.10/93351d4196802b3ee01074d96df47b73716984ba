scripts: kernel-doc: allow passing desired Sphinx C domain dialect

When kernel-doc is called via kerneldoc.py, there's no need to
auto-detect the Sphinx version, as the Sphinx module already
knows it. So, add an optional parameter to allow changing the
Sphinx dialect.

As kernel-doc can also be manually called, keep the auto-detection
logic if the parameter was not specified. On such case, emit
a warning if sphinx-build can't be found at PATH.

I ended using a suggestion from Joe for using a more readable
regex, instead of using a complex one with a hidden group like:

	m/^(\d+)\.(\d+)(?:\.?(\d+)?)/

in order to get the optional <patch> argument.
