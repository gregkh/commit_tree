arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add wakeup support for BT UART on sc7180-idp

Add the necessary pinctrl, interrupt property and a suitable sleep config
to support Bluetooth wakeup feature.

GPIO mode is configured in sleep state to drive the RTS/RFR line low.
If QUP function is selected in sleep state, UART RTS/RFR is pulled high
during suspend and BT SoC not able to send wakeup bytes.
