net/mlx5: DR, Add support for rule creation with flow source hint

Skip the rule according to flow arrival source, in case of RX and the
source is local port skip and in case of TX and the source is uplink
skip, we get this info according to the flow source hint we get from
upper layers when creating the rule.
This is needed because for example in case of FDB table which has a TX
and RX tables and we are inserting a rule with an encap action which
is only a TX action, in this case rule will fail on RX, so we can rely
on the flow source hint and skip RX in such case.
Until now we relied on metadata regc_0 that upper layer mapped the
port in the regc_0, but the problem is that upper layer did not always
use regc_0 for port mapping, so now we added support to flow source
hint which upper layers will pass to SW steering when creating a rule.
