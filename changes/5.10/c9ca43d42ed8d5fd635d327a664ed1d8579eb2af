serial: qcom_geni_serial: To correct QUP Version detection logic

For QUP IP versions 2.5 and above the oversampling rate is
halved from 32 to 16.

Commit ce734600545f ("tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Update
the oversampling rate") is pushed to handle this scenario.
But the existing logic is failing to classify QUP Version 3.0
into the correct group ( 2.5 and above).

As result Serial Engine clocks are not configured properly for
baud rate and garbage data is sampled to FIFOs from the line.

So, fix the logic to detect QUP with versions 2.5 and above.
