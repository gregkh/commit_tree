sched/fair: Simplify the work when reweighting entity

The code in reweight_entity() can be simplified.

For a sched entity on the rq, the entity accounting can be replaced by
cfs_rq instantaneous load updates currently called from within the
entity accounting.

Even though an entity on the rq can't represent a task in
reweight_entity() (a task is always dequeued before calling this
function) and so the numa task accounting and the rq->cfs_tasks list
management of the entity accounting are never called, the redundant
cfs_rq->nr_running decrement/increment will be avoided.
