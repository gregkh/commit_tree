ASoC: sun50i-codec-analog: Enable DAPM for line out switch

By including the line out mute switch in the DAPM graph, the
Mixer/DAC inputs can be powered off when the line output is muted.

The line outputs have an unusual routing scheme. The left side mute
switch is between the source selection and the amplifier, as usual.
The right side source selection comes *after* its amplifier (and
after the left side amplifier), and its mute switch controls
whichever source is currently selected. This matches the diagram in
the SoC manual.
