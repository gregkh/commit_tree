media: cedrus: Propagate OUTPUT resolution to CAPTURE

As per spec, the CAPTURE resolution should be automatically set based on
the OUTPUT resolution. This patch properly propagate width/height to the
capture when the OUTPUT format is set and override the user provided
width/height with configured OUTPUT resolution when the CAPTURE fmt is
updated.

This also prevents userspace from selecting a CAPTURE resolution that is
too small, avoiding kernel oops.
