net: brcmfmac: Replace in_interrupt()

brcmf_sdio_isr() is using in_interrupt() to distinguish if it is called
from a interrupt service routine or from a worker thread.

Passing such information from the calling context is preferred and
requested by Linus, so add an argument `in_isr' to brcmf_sdio_isr() and let
the callers pass the information about the calling context.
