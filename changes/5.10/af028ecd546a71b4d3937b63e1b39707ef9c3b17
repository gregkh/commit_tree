pinctrl: sh-pfc: Collect Renesas related CONFIGs in one place

Renesas related pinctrl CONFIGs are located in many places, which is
confusing.
This patch collects them into the same place, grouped in a new "Renesas
pinctrl drivers" menu.
This patch also moves pinctrl-rz{a1,a2,n1}.c into the sh-pfc folder.
