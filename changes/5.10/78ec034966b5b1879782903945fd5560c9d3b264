misc: hisi_hikey_usb: fix return of uninitialized ret status variable

Currently the return value from ret is uninitialized so the function
hisi_hikey_usb_parse_kirin970 is returning a garbage value when
succeeding. Since ret is not used anywhere else in the function, remove
it and just return 0 success at the end of the function.
