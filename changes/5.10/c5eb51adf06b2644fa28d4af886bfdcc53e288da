net/mlx5e: Fix VXLAN synchronization after function reload

During driver reload, perform firmware tear-down which results in
firmware losing the configured VXLAN ports. These ports are still
available in the driver's database. Fix this by cleaning up driver's
VXLAN database in the nic unload flow, before firmware tear-down. With
that, minimize mlx5_vxlan_destroy() to remove only what was added in
mlx5_vxlan_create() and warn on leftover UDP ports.
