net: hns3: Constify static structs

A number of static variables were not modified. Make them const to allow
the compiler to put them in read-only memory. In order to do so,
constify a couple of input pointers as well as some local pointers.
This moves about 35Kb to read-only memory as seen by the output of the
size command.
