bpf: Introducte bpf_this_cpu_ptr()

Add bpf_this_cpu_ptr() to help access percpu var on this cpu. This
helper always returns a valid pointer, therefore no need to check
returned value for NULL. Also note that all programs run with
preemption disabled, which means that the returned pointer is stable
during all the execution of the program.
