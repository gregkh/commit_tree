drm/i915: Reduce INTEL_DISPLAY_ENABLED to just treat outputs as disconnected

Since the display hardware is all there even when INTEL_DISPLAY_ENABLED
return false we have to be capable of shutting it down cleanly so
as to not anger the hw. To that end let's reduce the effect of
!INTEL_DISPLAY_ENABLE to just treating all outputs as disconnected.
Should prevent anyone from automagically enabling any of them, while
still allowing us to cleanly shut them down.
