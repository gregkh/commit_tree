dt-bindings: iio: adc: exynos-adc: do not require syscon on S5Pv210

The ADC in S5Pv210 does not have ADC phy registers in separate block for
which syscon would be needed.  Remove this requirement to fix dtbs_check
warnings like:

  arch/arm/boot/dts/s5pv210-fascinate4g.dt.yaml: adc@e1700000: 'samsung,syscon-phandle' is a required property
