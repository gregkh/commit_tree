sched: Bring the PF_IO_WORKER and PF_WQ_WORKER bits closer together

The bits PF_IO_WORKER and PF_WQ_WORKER are tested together in
sched_submit_work() which is considered to be a hot path.
If the two bits cross the 8 or 16 bit boundary then most architecture
require multiple load instructions in order to create the constant
value. Also, such a value can not be encoded within the compare opcode.

By moving the bit definition within the same block, the compiler can
create/use one immediate value.

For some reason gcc-10 on ARM64 requires both bits to be next to each
other in order to issue "tst reg, val; bne label". Otherwise the result
is "mov reg1, val; tst reg, reg1; bne label".

Move PF_VCPU out of the way so that PF_IO_WORKER can be next to
PF_WQ_WORKER.
