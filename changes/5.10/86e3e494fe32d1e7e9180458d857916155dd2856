KVM: VMX: Move uret MSR lookup into update_transition_efer()

Move checking for the existence of MSR_EFER in the uret MSR array into
update_transition_efer() so that the lookup and manipulation of the
array in setup_msrs() occur back-to-back.  This paves the way toward
adding a helper to wrap the lookup and manipulation.

To avoid unnecessary overhead, defer the lookup until the uret array
would actually be modified in update_transition_efer().  EFER obviously
exists on CPUs that support the dedicated VMCS fields for switching
EFER, and EFER must exist for the guest and host EFER.NX value to
diverge, i.e. there is no danger of attempting to read/write EFER when
it doesn't exist.
