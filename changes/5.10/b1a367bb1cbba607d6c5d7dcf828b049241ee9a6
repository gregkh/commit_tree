interconnect: qcom: osm-l3: Mark more structures const

These structures aren't modified at runtime. Mark them const so they get
moved to read-only memory. We have to cast away const in one place when
we store into the data member of struct icc_node. This is paired with a
re-const of the data member when it is extracted in qcom_icc_set().
