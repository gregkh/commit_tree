coredump: rework elf/elf_fdpic vma_dump_size() into common helper

At the moment, the binfmt_elf and binfmt_elf_fdpic code have slightly
different code to figure out which VMAs should be dumped, and if so,
whether the dump should contain the entire VMA or just its first page.

Eliminate duplicate code by reworking the binfmt_elf version into a
generic core dumping helper in coredump.c.

As part of that, change the heuristic for detecting executable/library
header pages to check whether the inode is executable instead of looking
at the file mode.

This is less problematic in terms of locking because it lets us avoid
get_user() under the mmap_sem.  (And arguably it looks nicer and makes
more sense in generic code.)

Adjust a little bit based on the binfmt_elf_fdpic version: ->anon_vma is
only meaningful under CONFIG_MMU, otherwise we have to assume that the VMA
has been written to.
