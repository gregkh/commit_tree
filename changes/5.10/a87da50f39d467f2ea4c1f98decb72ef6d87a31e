nvme-rdma: fix crash due to incorrect cqe

A crash happened due to injecting error test.
When a CQE has incorrect command id due do an error injection, the host
may find a request which is already freed.  Dereferencing req->mr->rkey
causes a crash in nvme_rdma_process_nvme_rsp because the mr is already
freed.

Add a check for the mr to fix it.
