XArray: add xa_get_order

Patch series "Fix read-only THP for non-tmpfs filesystems".

As described more verbosely in the [3/3] changelog, we can inadvertently
put an order-0 page in the page cache which occupies 512 consecutive
entries.  Users are running into this if they enable the
READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS config option; see
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206569 and Qian Cai has also
reported it here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200616013309.GB815@lca.pw/

This is a rather intrusive way of fixing the problem, but has the
advantage that I've actually been testing it with the THP patches, which
means that it sees far more use than it does upstream -- indeed, Song has
been entirely unable to reproduce it.  It also has the advantage that it
removes a few patches from my gargantuan backlog of THP patches.

This patch (of 3):

This function returns the order of the entry at the index.  We need this
because there isn't space in the shadow entry to encode its order.
