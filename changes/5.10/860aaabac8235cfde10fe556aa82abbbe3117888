x86/dumpstack: Do not try to access user space code of other tasks

sysrq-t ends up invoking show_opcodes() for each task which tries to access
the user space code of other processes, which is obviously bogus.

It either manages to dump where the foreign task's regs->ip points to in a
valid mapping of the current task or triggers a pagefault and prints "Code:
Bad RIP value.". Both is just wrong.

Add a safeguard in copy_code() and check whether the @regs pointer matches
currents pt_regs. If not, do not even try to access it.

While at it, add commentary why using copy_from_user_nmi() is safe in
copy_code() even if the function name suggests otherwise.
