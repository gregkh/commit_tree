net/mlx5e: Unify constants for WQE_EMPTY_DS_COUNT

A constant for the number of DS in an empty WQE (i.e. a WQE without data
segments) is needed in multiple places (normal TX data path, MPWQE in
XDP), but currently we have a constant for XDP and an inline formula in
normal TX. This patch introduces a common constant.

Additionally, mlx5e_xdp_mpwqe_session_start is converted to use struct
assignment, because the code nearby is touched.
