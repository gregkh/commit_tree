btrfs: kill the RCU protection for fs_info->space_info

We have this thing wrapped in an RCU lock, but it's really not needed.
We create all the space_info's on mount, and we destroy them on unmount.
The list never changes and we're protected from messing with it by the
normal mount/umount path, so kill the RCU stuff around it.
