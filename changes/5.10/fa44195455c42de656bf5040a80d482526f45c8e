tty: fix kernel-doc

With W=1, the kernel-doc checker complains quite a lot in the tty layer.
Over the time, many documented parameters were renamed, removed or
switched from tty to tty_port and similar. Some were mistyped in the doc
too.

So fix all these in the tty core. (But do not add the missing ones which
the checker complains about too. Not now.) The rest in the tty layer
will follow in the next patches.
