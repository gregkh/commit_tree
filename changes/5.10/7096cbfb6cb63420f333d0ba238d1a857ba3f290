KVM: VMX: Use "illegal GPA" helper for PT/RTIT output base check

Use kvm_vcpu_is_illegal_gpa() to check for a legal GPA when validating a
PT output base instead of open coding a clever, but difficult to read,
variant.  Code readability is far more important than shaving a few uops
in a slow path.

No functional change intended.
