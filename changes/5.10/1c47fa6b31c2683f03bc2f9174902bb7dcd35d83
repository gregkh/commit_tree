can: dev: add a helper function to calculate the duration of one bit

Rename macro CAN_CALC_SYNC_SEG to CAN_SYNC_SEG and make it available
through include/linux/can/dev.h

Add an helper function can_bit_time() which returns the duration (in
time quanta) of one CAN bit.

Rationale for this patch: the sync segment and the bit time are two
concepts which are defined in the CAN ISO standard. Device drivers for
CAN might need those.

Please refer to ISO 11898-1:2015, section 11.3.1.1 "Bit time" for
additional information.
