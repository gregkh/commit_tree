media: vidtv: add error checks

Currently, there are not checks if something gets bad during
memory allocation: it will simply use NULL pointers and
crash.

Add error path at the logic which allocates memory for the
MPEG-TS generator code, propagating the errors up to the
vidtv_bridge. Now, if something wents bad, start_streaming
will return an error that userspace can detect:

	ERROR    DMX_SET_PES_FILTER failed (PID = 0x2000): 12 Cannot allocate memory

and the driver doesn't crash.
