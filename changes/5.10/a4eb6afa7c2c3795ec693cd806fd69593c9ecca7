pinctrl: rza1: Switch to using "output-enable"

For pins requiring software driven IO output operations, the RZ/A1 Pin
Controller uses either the "output-high" or "output-low" DT property to
enable the corresponding output buffer.  The actual line value doesn't
matter, as it is ignored.

Commit 425562429d4f3b13 ("pinctrl: generic: Add output-enable property")
introduced a new DT property for this specific use case.

Update the RZ/A1 Pin Controller DT bindings and driver to use this new
property instead.  Preserve backwards compatibility with old DTBs in the
driver, as this comes at a very small cost.

Notes:
  - The DT binding examples already used the new property,
  - There are no upstream users of the old properties.
