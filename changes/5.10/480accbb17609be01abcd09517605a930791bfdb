perf streams: Introduce branch history "streams"

We define a stream as the branch history which is aggregated by the
branch records from perf samples. For example, the callchains aggregated
from the branch records are considered as streams.  By browsing the hot
stream, we can understand the hot code path.

Now we only support the callchain for stream. For measuring the hot
level for a stream, we use the callchain_node->hit, higher is hotter.

There may be many callchains sampled so we only focus on the top N
hottest callchains. N is a user defined parameter or predefined default
value (nr_streams_max).

This patch creates an evsel_streams array per event, and saves the top N
hottest streams in a stream array.

So now we can get the per-event top N hottest streams.
