x86/boot/compressed: Warn on orphan section placement

We don't want to depend on the linker's orphan section placement
heuristics as these can vary between linkers, and may change between
versions. All sections need to be explicitly handled in the linker
script.

Now that all sections are explicitly handled, enable orphan section
warnings.
