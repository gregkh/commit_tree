ARM: samsung: make pm-debug platform independent

The pm-debug code is one of the few things shared between
s3c24xx/s3c64xx and the newer s5pv210. In order to make s5pv210
independent of plat-samsung, change the common bits of this code to no
longer reference the s3c specific bits.

In particular, all the CPU checks need to be moved out of the common
code into platform specific files.
