can: tcan4x5x: replace depends on REGMAP_SPI with depends on SPI

regmap is a library function that gets selected by drivers that need it. No
driver modules should depend on it. Instead depends on SPI and select
REGMAP_SPI. Depending on REGMAP_SPI makes this driver only build if another
driver already selected REGMAP_SPI, as the symbol can't be selected through the
menu kernel configuration.
