csum_partial_copy_nocheck(): drop the last argument

It's always 0.  Note that we theoretically could use ~0U as well -
result will be the same modulo 0xffff, _if_ the damn thing did the
right thing for any value of initial sum; later we'll make use of
that when convenient.

However, unlike csum_and_copy_..._user(), there are instances that
did not work for arbitrary initial sums; c6x is one such.
