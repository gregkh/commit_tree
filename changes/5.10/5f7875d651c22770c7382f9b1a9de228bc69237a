PCI/ASPM: Remove struct aspm_register_info.latency_encoding

Previously we stored L0s and L1 Exit Latency information from the Link
Capabilities register in the struct aspm_register_info.

We only need these latencies when we already have the Link Capabilities
values, so use those directly and remove the latencies from struct
aspm_register_info.  No functional change intended.
