leds: pwm: Remove platform_data support

Since commit 141f15c66d94 ("leds: pwm: remove header") that platform
interface is not usable from outside and there seems to be no in tree
user anymore.  All in-tree users of the leds-pwm driver seem to use DT
currently.  Getting rid of the old platform interface allows the
leds-pwm driver to switch over from 'devm_led_classdev_register()' to
'devm_led_classdev_register_ext()'.
