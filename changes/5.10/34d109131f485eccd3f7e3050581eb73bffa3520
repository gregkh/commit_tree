selftests/vm: fix incorrect gcc invocation in some cases

Avoid accidental wrong builds, due to built-in rules working just a little
bit too well--but not quite as well as required for our situation here.

In other words, "make userfaultfd" (for example) is supposed to fail to
build at all, because this Makefile only supports either "make" (all), or
"make /full/path".  However, the built-in rules, if not suppressed, will
pick up CFLAGS and the initial LDLIBS (but not the target-specific LDLIBS,
because those are only set for the full path target!).  This causes it to
get pretty far into building things despite using incorrect values such as
an *occasionally* incomplete LDLIBS value.
