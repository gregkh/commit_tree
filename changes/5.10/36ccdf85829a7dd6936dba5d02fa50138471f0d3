net, xsk: Avoid taking multiple skbuff references

Commit 642e450b6b59 ("xsk: Do not discard packet when NETDEV_TX_BUSY")
addressed the problem that packets were discarded from the Tx AF_XDP
ring, when the driver returned NETDEV_TX_BUSY. Part of the fix was
bumping the skbuff reference count, so that the buffer would not be
freed by dev_direct_xmit(). A reference count larger than one means
that the skbuff is "shared", which is not the case.

If the "shared" skbuff is sent to the generic XDP receive path,
netif_receive_generic_xdp(), and pskb_expand_head() is entered the
BUG_ON(skb_shared(skb)) will trigger.

This patch adds a variant to dev_direct_xmit(), __dev_direct_xmit(),
where a user can select the skbuff free policy. This allows AF_XDP to
avoid bumping the reference count, but still keep the NETDEV_TX_BUSY
behavior.
