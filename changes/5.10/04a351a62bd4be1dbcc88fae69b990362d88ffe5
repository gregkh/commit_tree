netlink: rework policy dump to support multiple policies

Rework the policy dump code a bit to support adding multiple
policies to a single dump, in order to e.g. support per-op
policies in generic netlink.

v2:
 - move kernel-doc to implementation [Jakub]
 - squash the first patch to not flip-flop on the prototype
   [Jakub]
 - merge netlink_policy_dump_get_policy_idx() with the old
   get_policy_idx() we already had
 - rebase without Jakub's patch to have per-op dump
