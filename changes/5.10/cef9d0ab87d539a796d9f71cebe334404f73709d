staging: wfx: drop useless union hif_indication_data

The union hif_indication_data is never used in the driver. So, it is not
necessary to declare it separately from hif_ind_generic.

In add, drop prefix 'indication_' from the names 'indication_type' and
'indication_data' since it is redundant with the name of the struct.
