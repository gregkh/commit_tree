bnxt_en: Eliminate unnecessary RX resets.

Currently, the driver will schedule RX ring reset when we get a buffer
error in the RX completion record.  These RX buffer errors can be due
to normal out-of-buffer conditions or a permanent error in the RX
ring.  Because the driver cannot distinguish between these 2
conditions, we assume all these buffer errors require reset.

This is very disruptive when it is just a normal out-of-buffer
condition.  Newer firmware will now monitor the rings for the permanent
failure and will send a notification to the driver when it happens.
This allows the driver to reset only when such a notification is
received.  In environments where we have predominently out-of-buffer
conditions, we now can avoid these unnecessary resets.
