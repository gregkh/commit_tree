mm/page_owner: change split_page_owner to take a count

The implementation of split_page_owner() prefers a count rather than the
old order of the page.  When we support a variable size THP, we won't
have the order at this point, but we will have the number of pages.
So change the interface to what the caller and callee would prefer.
