rcutorture: Allow pointer leaks to test diagnostic code

This commit adds an rcutorture.leakpointer module parameter that
intentionally leaks an RCU-protected pointer out of the RCU read-side
critical section and checks to see if the corresponding grace period
has elapsed, emitting a WARN_ON_ONCE() if so.  This module parameter can
be used to test facilities like CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD that end
grace periods quickly.

While in the area, also document rcutorture.irqreader, which was
previously left out.
