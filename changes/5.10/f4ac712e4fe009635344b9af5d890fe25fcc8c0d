block: ratelimit handle_bad_sector() message

syzbot is reporting unkillable task [1], for the caller is failing to
handle a corrupted filesystem image which attempts to access beyond
the end of the device. While we need to fix the caller, flooding the
console with handle_bad_sector() message is unlikely useful.
