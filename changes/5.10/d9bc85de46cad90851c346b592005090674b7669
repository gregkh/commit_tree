ROMFS: support inode blocks calculation

When use 'stat' tool to display file status, the 'Blocks' field always in
'0', this is not good for tool 'du'(e.g.: busybox 'du'), it always output
'0' size for the files under ROMFS since such tool calculates number of
512B Blocks.

This patch calculates approx.  number of 512B blocks based on inode size.
