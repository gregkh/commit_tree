perf/x86/intel: Check perf metrics feature for each CPU

It might be possible that different CPUs have different CPU metrics on a
platform. In this case, writing the GLOBAL_CTRL_EN_PERF_METRICS bit to
the GLOBAL_CTRL register of a CPU, which doesn't support the TopDown
perf metrics feature, causes MSR access error.

Current TopDown perf metrics feature is enumerated using the boot CPU's
PERF_CAPABILITIES MSR. The MSR only indicates the boot CPU supports this
feature.

Check the PERF_CAPABILITIES MSR for each CPU. If any CPU doesn't support
the perf metrics feature, disable the feature globally.
