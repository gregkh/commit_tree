power: supply: charger-manager: Collect all power_supply_changed() calls

Current charger-manager calls power_supply_changed() whenever charging
status is changed. Remove the separated power_supply_changed() calls
and let it be called at end of try_charger_enable() function which
is called to set charging/discharging.
