clk: pxa: Constify static struct clk_ops

Constify a couple of static struct clk_ops that are not modified. Their
only usage is inside the macros and their address is passed to
clk_register_composite() which takes pointers to const struct clk_ops.
This allows the compiler to put them in read-only memory.
