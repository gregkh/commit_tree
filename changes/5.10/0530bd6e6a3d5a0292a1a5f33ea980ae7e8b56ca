net/smc: fix matching of existing link groups

With the multi-subnet support of SMC-Dv2 the match for existing link
groups should not include the vlanid of the network device.
Set ini->smcd_version accordingly before the call to smc_conn_create()
and use this value in smc_conn_create() to skip the vlanid check.
