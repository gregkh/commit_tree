spi: dw: De-assert chip-select on reset

SPI memory operations implementation will require to have the CS register
cleared before executing the operation in order not to have the
transmission automatically started prior the Tx FIFO is pre-initialized.
Let's clear the register then on explicit controller reset to fulfil the
requirements in case of an error or having the CS left set by a bootloader
or another software.
