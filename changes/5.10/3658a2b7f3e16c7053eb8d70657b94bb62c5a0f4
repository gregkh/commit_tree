ARM: dts: sun8i: r40: bananapi-m2-ultra: Fix dcdc1 regulator

DCDC1 regulator powers many different subsystems. While some of them can
work at 3.0 V, some of them can not. For example, VCC-HDMI can only work
between 3.24 V and 3.36 V. According to OS images provided by the board
manufacturer this regulator should be set to 3.3 V.

Set DCDC1 and DCDC1SW to 3.3 V in order to fix this.
