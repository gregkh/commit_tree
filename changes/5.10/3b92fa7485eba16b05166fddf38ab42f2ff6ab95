arm64: link with -z norelro regardless of CONFIG_RELOCATABLE

With CONFIG_EXPERT=y, CONFIG_KASAN=y, CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE=n,
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n, we observe the following failure when trying to
link the kernel image with LD=ld.lld:

error: section: .exit.data is not contiguous with other relro sections

ld.lld defaults to -z relro while ld.bfd defaults to -z norelro. This
was previously fixed, but only for CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.
