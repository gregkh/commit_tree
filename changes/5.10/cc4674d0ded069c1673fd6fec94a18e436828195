kvm: mmu: Separate making non-leaf sptes from link_shadow_page

The TDP MMU page fault handler will need to be able to create non-leaf
SPTEs to build up the paging structures. Rather than re-implementing the
function, factor the SPTE creation out of link_shadow_page.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.
