perf streams: Report hot streams

We show the streams separately. They are divided into different sections.

1. "Matched hot streams"

2. "Hot streams in old perf data only"

3. "Hot streams in new perf data only".

For each stream, we report the cycles and hot percent (hits%).

For example,

     cycles: 2, hits: 4.08%
