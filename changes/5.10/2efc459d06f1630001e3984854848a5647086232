sysfs: Add sysfs_emit and sysfs_emit_at to format sysfs output

Output defects can exist in sysfs content using sprintf and snprintf.

sprintf does not know the PAGE_SIZE maximum of the temporary buffer
used for outputting sysfs content and it's possible to overrun the
PAGE_SIZE buffer length.

Add a generic sysfs_emit function that knows that the size of the
temporary buffer and ensures that no overrun is done.

Add a generic sysfs_emit_at function that can be used in multiple
call situations that also ensures that no overrun is done.

Validate the output buffer argument to be page aligned.
Validate the offset len argument to be within the PAGE_SIZE buf.
