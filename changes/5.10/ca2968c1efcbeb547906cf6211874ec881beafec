RDMA/ucma: Fix refcount 0 incr in ucma_get_ctx()

Both ucma_destroy_id() and ucma_close_id() (triggered from an event via a
wq) can drive the refcount to zero. ucma_get_ctx() was wrongly assuming
that the refcount can only go to zero from ucma_destroy_id() which also
removes it from the xarray.

Use refcount_inc_not_zero() instead.
