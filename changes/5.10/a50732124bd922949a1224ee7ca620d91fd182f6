media: cx231xx: drop unnecessary list_empty

list_for_each_entry is able to handle an empty list.
The only effect of avoiding the loop is not initializing the
index variable.
Drop list_empty tests in cases where these variables are not
used.

Note that list_for_each_entry is defined in terms of list_first_entry,
which indicates that it should not be used on an empty list.  But in
list_for_each_entry, the element obtained by list_first_entry is not
really accessed, only the address of its list_head field is compared
to the address of the list head, so the list_first_entry is safe.

The semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

<smpl>
@@
expression x,e;
iterator name list_for_each_entry;
statement S;
identifier i;
@@

-if (!(list_empty(x))) {
   list_for_each_entry(i,x,...) S
- }
 ... when != i
? i = e
