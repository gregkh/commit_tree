ionic: refill lif identity after fw_up

After we do a fw upgrade and refill the ionic->ident.dev, we
also need to update the other identity info.  Since the lif
identity needs to be updated each time the ionic identity is
refreshed, we can pull it into ionic_identify().

The debugfs entry is moved so that it doesn't cause an
error message when the data is refreshed after the fw upgrade.
