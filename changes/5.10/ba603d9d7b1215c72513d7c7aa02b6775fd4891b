net/mlx4_en: Handle TX error CQE

In case error CQE was found while polling TX CQ, the QP is in error
state and all posted WQEs will generate error CQEs without any data
transmitted. Fix it by reopening the channels, via same method used for
TX timeout handling.

In addition add some more info on error CQE and WQE for debug.
