xen/events: add a proper barrier to 2-level uevent unmasking

A follow-up patch will require certain write to happen before an event
channel is unmasked.

While the memory barrier is not strictly necessary for all the callers,
the main one will need it. In order to avoid an extra memory barrier
when using fifo event channels, mandate evtchn_unmask() to provide
write ordering.

The 2-level event handling unmask operation is missing an appropriate
barrier, so add it. Fifo event channels are fine in this regard due to
using sync_cmpxchg().

This is part of XSA-332.
