can: xilinx_can: Fix incorrect variable and initialize with a default value

Some variables with incorrect type were passed to "of_property_read_u32"
API, "of_property_read_u32" API was expecting an "u32 *" but the formal
parameter that was passed was of type "int *". Fixed the issue by
changing the variable types from "int" to "u32" and initialized with a
default value. Fixed sparse warning.
