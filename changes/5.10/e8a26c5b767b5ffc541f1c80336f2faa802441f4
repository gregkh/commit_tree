iio:magn:hmc5843: Fix passing true where iio_shared_by enum required.

So it's obvious that the code is wrong in passing true, but I'm assuming
that will actually evaluate to 1 and hence IIO_SHARED_BY_TYPE.
The documentation however has this attribute as IIO_SHARED_BY_ALL.
My current assumption is the documentation is wrong.
If anyone knows otherwise please shout out!
