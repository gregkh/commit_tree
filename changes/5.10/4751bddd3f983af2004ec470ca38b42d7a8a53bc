perf tools: Make GTK2 support opt-in

This is bitrotting, nobody is stepping up to work on it, and since we
treat warnings as errors, feature detection is failing in its main,
faster test (tools/build/feature/test-all.c) because of the GTK+2
infobar check.

So make this opt-in, at some point ditch this if nobody volunteers to
take care of this.
