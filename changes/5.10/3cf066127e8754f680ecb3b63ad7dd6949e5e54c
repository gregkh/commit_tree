KVM: x86/mmu: Capture requested page level before NX huge page workaround

Apply the "huge page disallowed" adjustment of the max level only after
capturing the original requested level.  The requested level will be
used in a future patch to skip adding pages to the list of disallowed
huge pages if a huge page wasn't possible anyways, e.g. if the page
isn't mapped as a huge page in the host.

No functional change intended.
