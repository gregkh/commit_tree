MAINTAINERS: adjust to mcp251xfd file renaming

Commit 27cf93863cbc ("MAINTAINERS: Add entry for Microchip MCP25XXFD
SPI-CAN network driver"), added the MCP25XXFD SPI-CAN NETWORK DRIVER
section with the following two file entries:

F:      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/can/microchip,mcp25xxfd.yaml
F:      drivers/net/can/spi/mcp25xxfd/

Commit 1f0e21a0c065 ("can: mcp251xfd: rename driver files and subdir to
mcp251xfd") renamed the files from mcp25xxfd to mcp251xfd, but missed to
adjust the MAINTAINERS section.

Hence, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains:

  warning: no file matches    F: \
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/can/microchip,mcp25xxfd.yaml
  warning: no file matches    F:    drivers/net/can/spi/mcp25xxfd/

Adjust the MCP251XFD SPI-CAN NETWORK DRIVER section to this driver file
renaming.
