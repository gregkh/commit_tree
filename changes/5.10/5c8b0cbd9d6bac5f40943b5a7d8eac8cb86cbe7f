arm64: Pull in task_stack_page() to Spectre-v4 mitigation code

The kbuild robot reports that we're relying on an implicit inclusion to
get a definition of task_stack_page() in the Spectre-v4 mitigation code,
which is not always in place for some configurations:

  | arch/arm64/kernel/proton-pack.c:329:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'task_stack_page' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  |         task_pt_regs(task)->pstate |= val;
  |         ^
  | arch/arm64/include/asm/processor.h:268:36: note: expanded from macro 'task_pt_regs'
  |         ((struct pt_regs *)(THREAD_SIZE + task_stack_page(p)) - 1)
  |                                           ^
  | arch/arm64/kernel/proton-pack.c:329:2: note: did you mean 'task_spread_page'?

Add the missing include to fix the build error.
