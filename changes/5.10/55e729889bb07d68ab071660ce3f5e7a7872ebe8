net: udp: fix IP header access and skb lookup on Fast/frag0 UDP GRO

udp{4,6}_lib_lookup_skb() use ip{,v6}_hdr() to get IP header of the
packet. While it's probably OK for non-frag0 paths, this helpers
will also point to junk on Fast/frag0 GRO when all headers are
located in frags. As a result, sk/skb lookup may fail or give wrong
results. To support both GRO modes, skb_gro_network_header() might
be used. To not modify original functions, add private versions of
udp{4,6}_lib_lookup_skb() only to perform correct sk lookups on GRO.

Present since the introduction of "application-level" UDP GRO
in 4.7-rc1.

Misc: replace totally unneeded ternaries with plain ifs.
