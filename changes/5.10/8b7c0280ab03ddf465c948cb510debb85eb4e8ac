media: videobuf2: use sgtable-based scatterlist wrappers

Use recently introduced common wrappers operating directly on the struct
sg_table objects and scatterlist page iterators to make the code a bit
more compact, robust, easier to follow and copy/paste safe.

No functional change, because the code already properly did all the
scatterlist related calls.
