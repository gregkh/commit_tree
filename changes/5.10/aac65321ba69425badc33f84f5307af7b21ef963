mm/memory_hotplug: simplify page onlining

We don't allow to offline memory with holes, all boot memory is online,
and all hotplugged memory cannot have holes.

We can now simplify onlining of pages.  As we only allow to online/offline
full sections and sections always span full MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES, we can
just process MAX_ORDER - 1 pages without further special handling.

The number of onlined pages simply corresponds to the number of pages we
were requested to online.

While at it, refine the comment regarding the callback not exposing all
pages to the buddy.
