usb: host: ehci-platform: Add workaround for brcm, xgs-iproc-ehci

The ehci controller found in some Broadcom switches with integrated SoCs
has an issue which causes a soft lockup with large transfers like you
see when running ext4 on USB3 flash drive.

Port the fix from the Broadcom XLDK to increase the OUT_THRESHOLD to
avoid the problem.
