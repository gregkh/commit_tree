null_blk: Support shared tag bitmap

Support a shared tag bitmap, whereby request tags are unique over all
submission queues, and not just per submission queue.

As such, per device total queue depth is normally hw_queue_depth *
submit_queues, but hw_queue_depth when set. And a similar story for when
shared_tags is set, where that is the queue depth over all null blk
devices.
