x86/debug: Move historical SYSENTER junk into exc_debug_kernel()

The historical SYSENTER junk is explicitly for from-kernel, so move it
to the #DB-from-kernel handler.

It is ordered after the notifier, which is important for KGDB which uses TF
single-step and needs to consume the event before that point.
