x86/head/64: Switch to initial stack earlier

Make sure there is a stack once the kernel runs from virtual addresses.
At this stage any secondary CPU which boots will have lost its stack
because the kernel switched to a new page-table which does not map the
real-mode stack anymore.

This is needed for handling early #VC exceptions caused by instructions
like CPUID.
