NFSD: Call NFSv2 encoders on error returns

Remove special dispatcher logic for NFSv2 error responses. These are
rare to the point of becoming extinct, but all NFS responses have to
pay the cost of the extra conditional branches.

With this change, the NFSv2 error cases now get proper
xdr_ressize_check() calls.
