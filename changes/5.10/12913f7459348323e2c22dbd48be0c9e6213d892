bridge: mcast: Fix incomplete MDB dump

Each MDB entry is encoded in a nested netlink attribute called
'MDBA_MDB_ENTRY'. In turn, this attribute contains another nested
attributed called 'MDBA_MDB_ENTRY_INFO', which encodes a single port
group entry within the MDB entry.

The cited commit added the ability to restart a dump from a specific
port group entry. However, on failure to add a port group entry to the
dump the entire MDB entry (stored in 'nest2') is removed, resulting in
missing port group entries.

Fix this by finalizing the MDB entry with the partial list of already
encoded port group entries.
