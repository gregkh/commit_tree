drm/vc4: crtc: Move the cob allocation outside of bind

The COB allocation depends on the HVS channel used for a given
pixelvalve.

While the channel allocation was entirely static in vc4, vc5 changes
that and at bind time, a pixelvalve can be assigned to multiple
HVS channels.

Let's prepare that rework by allocating the COB when it's actually
needed.
