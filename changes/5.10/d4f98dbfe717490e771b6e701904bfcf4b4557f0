HID: roccat: add bounds checking in kone_sysfs_write_settings()

This code doesn't check if "settings->startup_profile" is within bounds
and that could result in an out of bounds array access.  What the code
does do is it checks if the settings can be written to the firmware, so
it's possible that the firmware has a bounds check?  It's safer and
easier to verify when the bounds checking is done in the kernel.
