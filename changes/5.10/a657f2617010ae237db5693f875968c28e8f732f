rcu: Execute RCU reader shortly after rcu_core for strict GPs

A kernel built with CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=y needs a quiescent
state to appear very shortly after a CPU has noticed a new grace period.
Placing an RCU reader immediately after this point is ineffective because
this normally happens in softirq context, which acts as a big RCU reader.
This commit therefore introduces a new per-CPU work_struct, which is
used at the end of rcu_core() processing to schedule an RCU read-side
critical section from within a clean environment.
