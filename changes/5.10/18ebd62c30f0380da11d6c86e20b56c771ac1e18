ASoC: sun8i-codec: Enable AIF mono/stereo control

Each left/right pair of AIF input/output channels can be swapped or
combined. This is useful for sending a mono audio source to both sides
of a stereo sink, or for creating complex mixing scenarios.

Add the support to control this feature from userspace.
