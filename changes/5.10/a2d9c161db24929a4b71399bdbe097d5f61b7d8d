soundwire: intel: pm_runtime idle scheduling

Add quirk and pm_runtime idle scheduling to let the Master suspend if
no Slaves become attached. This can happen when a link is not marked
as disabled and has devices exposed in the DSDT, if the power is
controlled by sideband means or the link includes a pluggable
connector.
