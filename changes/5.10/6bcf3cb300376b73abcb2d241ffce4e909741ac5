phy: cadence-torrent: Add support for PHY multilink configuration

Added support for multilink configuration of Torrent PHY. Currently,
maximum two links are supported. In case of multilink configuration,
PHY needs to be configured for both the protocols simultaneously at
the beginning as per the requirement of Torrent PHY.
Also, register sequences for PCIe + SGMII/QSGMII Unique SSC PHY multilink
configurations are added.
