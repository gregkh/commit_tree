iwlwifi: msix: limit max RX queues for 9000 family

There is an issue in the HW DMA engine in the 9000 family of devices
when more than 6 RX queues are used.  The issue is that the FW may
hang when IWL_MVM_RXQ_NSSN_SYNC notifications are sent.

Fix this by limiting the number of RX queues to 6 in the 9000 family
of devices.
