bus/fsl-mc: Export dprc_scan/dprc_remove functions to be used by multiple entities

Currently the DPRC scan function is used only by the bus driver.
But the same functionality will be needed by the VFIO driver.
To support this, the dprc scan function was exported and a little
bit adjusted to fit both scenarios. Also the scan mutex initialization
is done when the bus object is created, not in dprc_probe in order
to be used by both VFIO and bus driver.
Similarily dprc_remove_devices is exported to be used by VFIO.
