dt: bindings: lp50xx: Introduce the lp50xx family of RGB drivers

Introduce the bindings for the Texas Instruments LP5036, LP5030, LP5024,
LP5018, LP5012 and LP5009 RGB LED device driver.  The LP5036/30/24/18/12/9
can control RGB LEDs individually or as part of a control bank group.
These devices have the ability to adjust the mixing control for the RGB
LEDs to obtain different colors independent of the overall brightness of
the LED grouping.
