cpufreq: armada-37xx: Add missing MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE

CONFIG_ARM_ARMADA_37XX_CPUFREQ is tristate option and therefore this
cpufreq driver can be compiled as a module. This patch adds missing
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE which generates correct modalias for automatic
loading of this cpufreq driver when is compiled as an external module.
