libbpf: Make btf_dump work with modifiable BTF

Ensure that btf_dump can accommodate new BTF types being appended to BTF
instance after struct btf_dump was created. This came up during attemp to
use btf_dump for raw type dumping in selftests, but given changes are not
excessive, it's good to not have any gotchas in API usage, so I decided to
support such use case in general.
