ASoC: wm_adsp: Pass full name to snd_ctl_notify

A call to wm_adsp_write_ctl() could cause a kernel crash if it
does not retrieve a valid kcontrol from snd_soc_card_get_kcontrol().
This can happen due to a missing control name prefix. Then,
snd_ctl_notify() crashes when it tries to use the id field.

Modified wm_adsp_write_ctl() to incorporate the name_prefix (if applicable)
such that it is able to retrieve a valid id field from the kcontrol
once the platform has booted.
