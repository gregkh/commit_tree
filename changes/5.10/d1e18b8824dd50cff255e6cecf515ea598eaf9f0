ext4: fix bs < ps issue reported with dioread_nolock mount opt

left shifting m_lblk by blkbits was causing value overflow and hence
it was not able to convert unwritten to written extent.
So, make sure we typecast it to loff_t before do left shift operation.
Also in func ext4_convert_unwritten_io_end_vec(), make sure to initialize
ret variable to avoid accidentally returning an uninitialized ret.

This patch fixes the issue reported in ext4 for bs < ps with
dioread_nolock mount option.
