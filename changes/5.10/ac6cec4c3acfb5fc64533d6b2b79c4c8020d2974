ARM: dts: aspeed: minipack: Update 64MB FMC flash layout

Set 64Mb FMC flash layout in Minipack device tree explicitly because the
flash layout was removed from "ast2500-facebook-netbmc-common.dtsi".

Please note "data0" partition' size is updated to 4MB to be consistent
with other Facebook OpenBMC platforms.
