x86/msr-index: Define an IA32_PASID MSR

The IA32_PASID MSR (0xd93) contains the Process Address Space Identifier
(PASID), a 20-bit value. Bit 31 must be set to indicate the value
programmed in the MSR is valid. Hardware uses the PASID to identify a
process address space and direct responses to the right address space.
