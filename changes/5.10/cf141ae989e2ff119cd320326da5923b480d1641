ARM/keystone: move the DMA offset handling under ifdef CONFIG_ARM_LPAE

The DMA offset notifier can only be used if PHYS_OFFSET is at least
KEYSTONE_HIGH_PHYS_START, which can't be represented by a 32-bit
phys_addr_t.  Currently the code compiles fine despite that, a pending
change to the DMA offset handling would create a compiler warning for
this case.  Add an ifdef to not compile the code except for LPAE
configs.
