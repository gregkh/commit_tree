clk: imx8m: fix bus critical clk registration

noc/axi/ahb are bus clk, not peripheral clk.
Since peripheral clk has a limitation that for peripheral clock slice,
IP clock slices must be stopped to change the clock source.

However if the bus clk is marked as critical clk peripheral, the
assigned clock parent operation will fail.

So we added CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE flag to avoid glitch.

And add imx8m_clk_hw_composite_bus_critical for bus critical clock usage
