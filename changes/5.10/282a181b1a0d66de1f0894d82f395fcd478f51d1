seccomp: Move config option SECCOMP to arch/Kconfig

In order to make adding configurable features into seccomp easier,
it's better to have the options at one single location, considering
especially that the bulk of seccomp code is arch-independent. An quick
look also show that many SECCOMP descriptions are outdated; they talk
about /proc rather than prctl.

As a result of moving the config option and keeping it default on,
architectures arm, arm64, csky, riscv, sh, and xtensa did not have SECCOMP
on by default prior to this and SECCOMP will be default in this change.

Architectures microblaze, mips, powerpc, s390, sh, and sparc have an
outdated depend on PROC_FS and this dependency is removed in this change.
