media: cedrus: h264: Fix frame list construction

Current frame list construction algorithm assumes that decoded image
will be output into its own buffer. That is true for progressive content
but not for interlaced where each field is decoded separately into same
buffer.

Fix that by checking if capture buffer is listed in DPB. If it is, reuse
it.
