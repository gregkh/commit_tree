net/tls: Fix wrong record sn in async mode of device resync

In async_resync mode, we log the TCP seq of records until the async request
is completed.  Later, in case one of the logged seqs matches the resync
request, we return it, together with its record serial number.  Before this
fix, we mistakenly returned the serial number of the current record
instead.
