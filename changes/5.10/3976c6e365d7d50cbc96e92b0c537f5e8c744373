platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Clean up: Remove the duplicate comments and reorganize

Some of the Cannon Lake PCH IPs are reused by most of the platforms
such as Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Elkhart Lake, Jasper Lake and can be
reused by future platforms as well. The same was mentioned via comments
not once but twice in an array of bit map structs for Cannon Lake
(cnp_pfear_map).

Hence, remove the duplicate comments and reorganize them.
