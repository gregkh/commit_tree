soc: ti: pruss: Add support for PRU-ICSS subsystems on 66AK2G SoC

The 66AK2G SoC supports two PRU-ICSS instances, named PRUSS0 and PRUSS1,
each of which has two PRU processor cores. The two PRU-ICSS instances
are identical to each other with few minor SoC integration differences,
and are very similar to the PRU-ICSS1 of AM57xx/AM43xx. The Shared Data
RAM size is larger and the number of interrupts coming into MPU INTC
is like the instances on AM437x. There are also few other differences
attributing to integration in Keystone architecture (like no SYSCFG
register or PRCM handshake protocols). Other IP level differences
include different constant table, differences in system event interrupt
input sources etc. They also do not have a programmable module reset
line like those present on AM33xx/AM43xx SoCs. The modules are reset
just like any other IP with the SoC's global cold/warm resets.

The existing PRUSS platform driver has been enhanced to support these
66AK2G PRU-ICSS instances through new 66AK2G specific compatible for
properly probing and booting all the different PRU cores in each
PRU-ICSS processor subsystem. A build dependency with ARCH_KEYSTONE
is added to enable the driver to be built in K2G-only configuration.
