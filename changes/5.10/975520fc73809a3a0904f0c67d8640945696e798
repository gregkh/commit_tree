mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: fix reference clock source selection

The bit ESDHC_PERIPHERAL_CLK_SEL to select using peripheral clock
or platform clock is not able to be reset by SDHCI_RESET_ALL.
So driver needs to initialize it as 1 or 0 once, to override the
different value which may be configured in bootloader.
