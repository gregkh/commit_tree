checkpatch: warn on self-assignments

The uninitialized_var() macro was removed recently via commit 63a0895d960a
("compiler: Remove uninitialized_var() macro") as it's not a particularly
useful warning and its use can "paper over real bugs".

Add a checkpatch test to warn on self-assignments as a means to avoid
compiler warnings and as a back-door mechanism to reproduce the old
uninitialized_var macro behavior.
