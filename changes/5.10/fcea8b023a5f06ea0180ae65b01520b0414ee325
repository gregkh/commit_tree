ASoC: da7219: Fix I/O voltage range configuration during probe

Previous improvements around handling device and codec level
probe functionality added the possibility of the voltage level
being undefined for the scenario where the IO voltage retrieved
from the regulator supply was below 1.2V, whereas previously the
code defaulted to the 2.5V to 3.6V range in that case. This
commit restores the default value to avoid this happening.
