genirq/PM: Introduce IRQCHIP_ENABLE_WAKEUP_ON_SUSPEND flag

An interrupt that is disabled/masked but set for wakeup may still need to
be able to wake up the system from sleep states like "suspend to RAM".

To that effect, introduce the IRQCHIP_ENABLE_WAKEUP_ON_SUSPEND flag.
If the irqchip have this flag set, the irq PM code will enable/unmask
the irqs that are marked for wakeup, but that are in a disabled state.

On resume, such irqs will be restored back to their disabled state.
