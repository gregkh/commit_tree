kvm: arm64: Partially link nVHE hyp code, simplify HYPCOPY

Relying on objcopy to prefix the ELF section names of the nVHE hyp code
is brittle and prevents us from using wildcards to match specific
section names.

Improve the build rules by partially linking all '.nvhe.o' files and
prefixing their ELF section names using a linker script. Continue using
objcopy for prefixing ELF symbol names.

One immediate advantage of this approach is that all subsections
matching a pattern can be merged into a single prefixed section, eg.
.text and .text.* can be linked into a single '.hyp.text'. This removes
the need for -fno-reorder-functions on GCC and will be useful in the
future too: LTO builds use .text subsections, compilers routinely
generate .rodata subsections, etc.

Partially linking all hyp code into a single object file also makes it
easier to analyze.
