s390/bpf: Fix multiple tail calls

In order to branch around tail calls (due to out-of-bounds index,
exceeding tail call count or missing tail call target), JIT uses
label[0] field, which contains the address of the instruction following
the tail call. When there are multiple tail calls, label[0] value comes
from handling of a previous tail call, which is incorrect.

Fix by getting rid of label array and resolving the label address
locally: for all 3 branches that jump to it, emit 0 offsets at the
beginning, and then backpatch them with the correct value.

Also, do not use the long jump infrastructure: the tail call sequence
is known to be short, so make all 3 jumps short.
