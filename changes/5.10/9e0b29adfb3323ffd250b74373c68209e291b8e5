docs: ABI: sysfs-class-power: unify duplicated properties

The ABI is not supposed to have duplicated entries, as warned
by get_abi.pl:

Yet, both USB and Battery share a common set of charging-related
properties.

Unify the entries for such properties in order to avoid
duplication, while preserving the battery and USB-specific
data properly documented.
