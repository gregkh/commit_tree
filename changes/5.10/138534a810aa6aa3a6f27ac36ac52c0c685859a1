KVM: nVMX: WARN on attempt to switch the currently loaded VMCS

WARN if KVM attempts to switch to the currently loaded VMCS.  Now that
nested_vmx_free_vcpu() doesn't blindly call vmx_switch_vmcs(), all paths
that lead to vmx_switch_vmcs() are implicitly guarded by guest vs. host
mode, e.g. KVM should never emulate VMX instructions when guest mode is
active, and nested_vmx_vmexit() should never be called when host mode is
active.
