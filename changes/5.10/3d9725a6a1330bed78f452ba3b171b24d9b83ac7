net/smc: common routine for CLC accept and confirm

smc_clc_send_accept() and smc_clc_send_confirm() are quite similar.
Move common code into a separate function smc_clc_send_confirm_accept().
And introduce separate SMCD and SMCR struct definitions for CLC accept
resp. confirm.
No functional change.
