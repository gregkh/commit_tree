RDMA/core: Introduce new GID table query API

Introduce rdma_query_gid_table which enables querying all the GID tables
of a given device and copying the attributes of all valid GID entries to a
provided buffer.

This API provides a faster way to query a GID table using single call and
will be used in libibverbs to improve current approach that requires
multiple calls to open, close and read multiple sysfs files for a single
GID table entry.
