w1: Constify static w1_family_ops structs

The only usage of these structs is to assign their address to the fops
field in the w1_family struct, which is a const pointer. Make them const
to allow the compiler to put them in read-only memory.

This was done with the following Coccinelle semantic patch
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/):

// <smpl>
@r1 disable optional_qualifier @
identifier i;
position p;
@@
static struct w1_family_ops i@p = {...};

@ok1@
identifier r1.i;
position p;
identifier s;
@@
static struct w1_family s = {
	.fops=&i@p,
};

@bad1@
position p!={r1.p,ok1.p};
identifier r1.i;
@@
i@p

@depends on !bad1 disable optional_qualifier@
identifier r1.i;
@@
static
+const
struct w1_family_ops i={};
// </smpl>
