platform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: Send enum values to usb_role_switch_set_role()

usb_role_switch_set_role() has the second argument as enum for usb_role.
Currently depending upon the data role i.e. UFP(0) or DFP(1) is sent.
This eventually translates to USB_ROLE_NONE in case of UFP and
USB_ROLE_DEVICE in case of DFP. Correct this by sending correct enum
values as USB_ROLE_DEVICE in case of UFP and USB_ROLE_HOST in case of
DFP.
