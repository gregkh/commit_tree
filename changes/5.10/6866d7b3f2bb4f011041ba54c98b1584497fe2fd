ext4 / jbd2: add fast commit initialization

This patch adds fast commit area trackers in the journal_t
structure. These are initialized via the jbd2_fc_init() routine that
this patch adds. This patch also adds ext4/fast_commit.c and
ext4/fast_commit.h files for fast commit code that will be added in
subsequent patches in this series.
