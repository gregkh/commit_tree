powerpc/smp: Implement cpu_to_coregroup_id

Lookup the coregroup id from the associativity array.

If unable to detect the coregroup id, fallback on the core id.
This way, ensure sched_domain degenerates and an extra sched domain is
not created.

Ideally this function should have been implemented in
arch/powerpc/kernel/smp.c. However if its implemented in mm/numa.c, we
don't need to find the primary domain again.

If the device-tree mentions more than one coregroup, then kernel
implements only the last or the smallest coregroup, which currently
corresponds to the penultimate domain in the device-tree.
