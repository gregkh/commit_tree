bpf: Relax max_entries check for most of the inner map types

Most of the maps do not use max_entries during verification time.
Thus, those map_meta_equal() do not need to enforce max_entries
when it is inserted as an inner map during runtime.  The max_entries
check is removed from the default implementation bpf_map_meta_equal().

The prog_array_map and xsk_map are exception.  Its map_gen_lookup
uses max_entries to generate inline lookup code.  Thus, they will
implement its own map_meta_equal() to enforce max_entries.
Since there are only two cases now, the max_entries check
is not refactored and stays in its own .c file.
