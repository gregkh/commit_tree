sched/fair: Fix overutilized update in enqueue_task_fair()

enqueue_task_fair() attempts to skip the overutilized update for new
tasks as their util_avg is not accurate yet. However, the flag we check
to do so is overwritten earlier on in the function, which makes the
condition pretty much a nop.

Fix this by saving the flag early on.
