KVM: arm64: nVHE: Don't consume host SErrors with ESB

The ESB at the start of the host vector may cause SErrors to be consumed
to DISR_EL1. However, this is not checked for the host so the SError
could go unhandled.

Remove the ESB so that SErrors are not consumed but are instead left
pending for the host to consume. __guest_enter already defers entry into
a guest if there are any SErrors pending.
