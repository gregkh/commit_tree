KVM: x86: Move illegal GPA helper out of the MMU code

Rename kvm_mmu_is_illegal_gpa() to kvm_vcpu_is_illegal_gpa() and move it
to cpuid.h so that's it's colocated with cpuid_maxphyaddr().  The helper
is not MMU specific and will gain a user that is completely unrelated to
the MMU in a future patch.

No functional change intended.
