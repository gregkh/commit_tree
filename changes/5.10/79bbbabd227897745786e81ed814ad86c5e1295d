perf config: Export the perf_config_from_file() function

We'll use it to ask for extra config files to be loaded, profile like
stuff that will be used first to make 'perf trace' mimic 'strace' output
via a 'perf strace' command that just sets up 'perf trace' output.

At some point it'll be used for regression tests, where we'll run some
simple commands like:

  perf strace ls > perf-strace.output
  strace ls > strace.output

And then do some mutable syscall arg aware diff like tool to deal with
arguments for things like mmap, that change at each execution, to be
first ignored and then properly tracked when used accoss multiple
syscalls.
