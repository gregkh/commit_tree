usb: gadget: goku_udc: fix potential crashes in probe

goku_probe() goes to error label "err" and invokes goku_remove()
in case of failures of pci_enable_device(), pci_resource_start()
and ioremap(). goku_remove() gets a device from
pci_get_drvdata(pdev) and works with it without any checks, in
particular it dereferences a corresponding pointer. But
goku_probe() did not set this device yet. So, one can expect
various crashes. The patch moves setting the device just after
allocation of memory for it.
