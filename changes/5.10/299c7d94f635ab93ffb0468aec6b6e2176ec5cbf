rcutorture: Hoist OOM registry up one level

Currently, registering and unregistering the OOM notifier is done
right before and after the test, respectively.  This will not work
well for multi-threaded tests, so this commit hoists this registering
and unregistering up into the rcu_torture_fwd_prog_init() and
rcu_torture_fwd_prog_cleanup() functions.
