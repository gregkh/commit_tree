wcn36xx: Update wcn36xx_smd_config_bss_v1() to operate internally

This patch updates wcn36xx_smd_config_bss_v1() to update on internally
derived parameters only, specifically making use of STA v1 wrapper routines
previously added.

Once done we no longer need to pass a struct wcn36xx_hal_config_bss_req_msg
which gives us options in later patches to eliminate the kzalloc() in
wcn36xx_smd_config_bss entirely.
