iommu/uapi: Add argsz for user filled data

As IOMMU UAPI gets extended, user data size may increase. To support
backward compatibiliy, this patch introduces a size field to each UAPI
data structures. It is *always* the responsibility for the user to fill in
the correct size. Padding fields are adjusted to ensure 8 byte alignment.

Specific scenarios for user data handling are documented in:
Documentation/userspace-api/iommu.rst

As there is no current users of the API, struct version is not
incremented.
