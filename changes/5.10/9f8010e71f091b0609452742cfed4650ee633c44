rtc: ds1685: Fix bank switching to avoid endless loop

ds1685_rtc_begin_data_access() tried to access an extended register before
enabling access to it by switching to bank 1. Depending on content in NVRAM
this could lead to an endless loop. While at it fix also switch back to
bank 0 in ds1685_rtc_end_data_access().
