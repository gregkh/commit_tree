membarrier: Add an actual barrier before rseq_preempt()

It seems that most RSEQ membarrier users will expect any stores done before
the membarrier() syscall to be visible to the target task(s).  While this
is extremely likely to be true in practice, nothing actually guarantees it
by a strict reading of the x86 manuals.  Rather than providing this
guarantee by accident and potentially causing a problem down the road, just
add an explicit barrier.
