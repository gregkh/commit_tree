seccomp: kill process instead of thread for unknown actions

Asynchronous termination of a thread outside of the userspace thread
library's knowledge is an unsafe operation that leaves the process in
an inconsistent, corrupt, and possibly unrecoverable state. In order
to make new actions that may be added in the future safe on kernels
not aware of them, change the default action from
SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD to SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS.
