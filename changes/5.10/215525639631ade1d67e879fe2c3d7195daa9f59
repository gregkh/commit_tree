X.509: support OSCCA SM2-with-SM3 certificate verification

The digital certificate format based on SM2 crypto algorithm as
specified in GM/T 0015-2012. It was published by State Encryption
Management Bureau, China.

The method of generating Other User Information is defined as
ZA=H256(ENTLA || IDA || a || b || xG || yG || xA || yA), it also
specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-shen-sm2-ecdsa-02.

The x509 certificate supports SM2-with-SM3 type certificate
verification.  Because certificate verification requires ZA
in addition to tbs data, ZA also depends on elliptic curve
parameters and public key data, so you need to access tbs in sig
and calculate ZA. Finally calculate the digest of the
signature and complete the verification work. The calculation
process of ZA is declared in specifications GM/T 0009-2012
and GM/T 0003.2-2012.
