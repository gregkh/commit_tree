arm64: Treat SSBS as a non-strict system feature

If all CPUs discovered during boot have SSBS, then spectre-v4 will be
considered to be "mitigated". However, we still allow late CPUs without
SSBS to be onlined, albeit with a "SANITY CHECK" warning. This is
problematic for userspace because it means that the system can quietly
transition to "Vulnerable" at runtime.

Avoid this by treating SSBS as a non-strict system feature: if all of
the CPUs discovered during boot have SSBS, then late arriving secondaries
better have it as well.
