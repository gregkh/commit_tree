drm/i915: Nuke MI_ARB_STATE save/restore

Originally added in commit 1f84e550a870 ("drm/i915 more registers for
S3 (DSPCLK_GATE_D, CACHE_MODE_0, MI_ARB_STATE)") to fix some underruns.
I suspect that was due to the trickle feed settings getting clobbered
during suspend. We've been disabling trickle feed explicitly since
commit 20f949670f51 ("drm/i915: Disable trickle feed via MI_ARB_STATE
for the gen4") so this magic save/restore should no longer be needed.
