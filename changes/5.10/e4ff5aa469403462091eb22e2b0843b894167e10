netdevsim: Add debugfs toggle to reject BPF programs in verifier

This adds a new debugfs toggle ('bpf_bind_verifier_accept') that can be
used to make netdevsim reject BPF programs from being accepted by the
verifier. If this toggle (which defaults to true) is set to false,
nsim_bpf_verify_insn() will return EOPNOTSUPP on the last
instruction (after outputting the 'Hello from netdevsim' verifier message).

This makes it possible to check the verification callback in the driver
from test_offload.py in selftests, since the verifier now clears the
verifier log on a successful load, hiding the message from the driver.
