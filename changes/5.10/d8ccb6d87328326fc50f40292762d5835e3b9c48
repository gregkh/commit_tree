bus/fsl-mc: Add a new version for dprc_get_obj_region command

The region size reported by the firmware for mc and software
portals was less than allocated by the hardware. This may be
problematic when mmapping the region in user space because the
region size is less than page size. However the size as reserved
by the hardware is 64K.
