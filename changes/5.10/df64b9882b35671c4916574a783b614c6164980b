ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: add version_id to avoid rt714/rt715 confusion

RT715 and RT714 are essentially the same chip. In addition, there are
two versions, one supporting SoundWire 1.1 and one supporting
SoundWire 1.2 (SDCA).

The previous configurations assumed that RT714 was SDCA-only, which
isn't correct. Add support for the 4 possible combinations to avoid
confusions.
