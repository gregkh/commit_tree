KVM: arm64: Fix AArch32 handling of DBGD{CCINT,SCRext} and DBGVCR

The DBGD{CCINT,SCRext} and DBGVCR register entries in the cp14 array
are missing their target register, resulting in all accesses being
targetted at the guard sysreg (indexed by __INVALID_SYSREG__).

Point the emulation code at the actual register entries.
