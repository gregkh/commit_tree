s390/pci: remove clp_rescan_pci_devices()

there is only one call site of clp_rescan_pci_devices() and
all the function does is call zpci_remove_reserved_devices()
followed by a duplicating clp_scan_pci_devices().
So inline the single call as a call to zpci_remove_reserved_devices()
and clp_scan_pci_devices() and remove the function.
