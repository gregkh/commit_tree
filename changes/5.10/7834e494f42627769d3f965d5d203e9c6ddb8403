dpaa_eth: fix the RX headroom size alignment

The headroom reserved for received frames needs to be aligned to an
RX specific value. There is currently a discrepancy between the values
used in the Ethernet driver and the values passed to the FMan.
Coincidentally, the resulting aligned values are identical.
