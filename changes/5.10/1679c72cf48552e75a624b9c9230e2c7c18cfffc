sfc: de-indirect TSO handling

Remove the tx_queue->handle_tso function pointer, and just use
 tx_queue->tso_version to decide which function to call, thus removing
 an indirect call from the fast path.
Instead of passing a tso_v2 flag to efx_mcdi_tx_init(), set the desired
 tx_queue->tso_version before calling it.
In efx_mcdi_tx_init(), report back failure to obtain a TSOv2 context by
 setting tx_queue->tso_version to 0, which will cause the TX path to
 use the GSO-based fallback.
