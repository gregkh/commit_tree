gfs2: Don't call cancel_delayed_work_sync from within delete work function

Right now, we can end up calling cancel_delayed_work_sync from within
delete_work_func via gfs2_lookup_by_inum -> gfs2_inode_lookup ->
gfs2_cancel_delete_work.  When that happens, it will result in a
deadlock.  Instead, gfs2_inode_lookup should skip the call to
gfs2_cancel_delete_work when called from delete_work_func (blktype ==
GFS2_BLKST_UNLINKED).
