selftests/bpf/test_offload.py: Filter bpftool internal map when counting maps

A few of the tests in test_offload.py expects to see a certain number of
maps created, and checks this by counting the number of maps returned by
bpftool. There is already a filter that will remove any maps already there
at the beginning of the test, but bpftool now creates a map for the PID
iterator rodata on each invocation, which makes the map count wrong. Fix
this by also filtering the pid_iter.rodata map by name when counting.
