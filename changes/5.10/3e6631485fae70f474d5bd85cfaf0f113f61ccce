vmlinux.lds.h: Keep .ctors.* with .ctors

Under some circumstances, the compiler generates .ctors.* sections. This
is seen doing a cross compile of x86_64 from a powerpc64el host:

x86_64-linux-gnu-ld: warning: orphan section `.ctors.65435' from `kernel/trace/trace_clock.o' being
placed in section `.ctors.65435'
x86_64-linux-gnu-ld: warning: orphan section `.ctors.65435' from `kernel/trace/ftrace.o' being
placed in section `.ctors.65435'
x86_64-linux-gnu-ld: warning: orphan section `.ctors.65435' from `kernel/trace/ring_buffer.o' being
placed in section `.ctors.65435'

Include these orphans along with the regular .ctors section.
