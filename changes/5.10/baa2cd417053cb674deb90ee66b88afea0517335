arm64: stacktrace: Make stack walk callback consistent with generic code

As with the generic arch_stack_walk() code the arm64 stack walk code takes
a callback that is called per stack frame. Currently the arm64 code always
passes a struct stackframe to the callback and the generic code just passes
the pc, however none of the users ever reference anything in the struct
other than the pc value. The arm64 code also uses a return type of int
while the generic code uses a return type of bool though in both cases the
return value is a boolean value and the sense is inverted between the two.

In order to reduce code duplication when arm64 is converted to use
arch_stack_walk() change the signature and return sense of the arm64
specific callback to match that of the generic code.
