blk-iocost: replace iocg->has_surplus with ->surplus_list

Instead of marking iocgs with surplus with a flag and filtering for them
while walking all active iocgs, build a surpluses list. This doesn't make
much difference now but will help implementing improved donation logic which
will iterate iocgs with surplus multiple times.
