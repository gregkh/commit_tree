spi: spi-s3c64xx: Ensure cur_speed holds actual clock value

Make sure the cur_speed value used in s3c64xx_enable_datapath()
to configure DMA channel and in s3c64xx_wait_for_*() to calculate the
transfer timeout is set to the actual value of (half) the clock speed.

Don't change non-CMU case, because no frequency calculation errors have
been reported.
