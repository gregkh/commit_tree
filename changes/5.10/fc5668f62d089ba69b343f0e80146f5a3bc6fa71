ASoC: sun8i-codec: Correct DAPM widget types

Whie the aif_in and aif_out widget types are handled exactly the same in
the core DAPM code, a future widget event hook will need the correct
widget type to derive the associated substream. Clean up the widget type
for that reason, and so these widgets will match newly-added widgets for
the other AIFs.
