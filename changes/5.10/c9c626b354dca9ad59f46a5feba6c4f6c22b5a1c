xfs: directly call xfs_generic_create() for ->create() and ->mkdir()

The current create and mkdir handlers both call the xfs_vn_mknod()
which is a wrapper routine around xfs_generic_create() function.
Actually the create and mkdir handlers can directly call
xfs_generic_create() function and reduce the call chain.
