net: ipa: fix two comments

In ipa_uc_response_hdlr() a comment uses the wrong function name
when it describes where a clock reference is taken.  Fix this.

Also fix the comment in ipa_uc_response_hdlr() to correctly refer to
ipa_uc_setup(), which is where the clock reference described here is
taken.
