ASoC: SOF: fix range checks

On multiple locations checks are performed of untrusted values after adding
a constant to them. This is wrong, because the addition might overflow and
the result can then pass the check, although the original value is invalid.
Fix multiple such issues by checking the actual value and not a sum of it
and a constant.
