tracepoint: Optimize using static_call()

Currently the tracepoint site will iterate a vector and issue indirect
calls to however many handlers are registered (ie. the vector is
long).

Using static_call() it is possible to optimize this for the common
case of only having a single handler registered. In this case the
static_call() can directly call this handler. Otherwise, if the vector
is longer than 1, call a function that iterates the whole vector like
the current code.
