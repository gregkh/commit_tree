KVM: arm64: Consolidate REG_HIDDEN_GUEST/USER

REG_HIDDEN_GUEST and REG_HIDDEN_USER are always used together.
Consolidate them into a single REG_HIDDEN flag. We can always
add another flag later if some register needs to expose itself
differently to the guest than it does to userspace.

No functional change intended.
