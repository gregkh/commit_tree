ASoC: Intel: modify SoundWire version id in acpi match table

The SoundWire version id of the existing RT1308, RT711, and RT715
codecs should be 2 (index for SoundWire 1.1), it was mistakenly set as
1 which pointed to the wrong version (SoundWire 1.0).

This off-by-one error had no functional impact so far since the
version number was not used, however in future patches this version
will be required.
