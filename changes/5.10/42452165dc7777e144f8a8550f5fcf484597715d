drm/mgag200: Move register initialization into helper function

The mgag200 driver maps registers into the address space. Move the
code into a separate helper function. No functional changes.

One small difference is in the handling of SDRAM/SGRAM. MGA devices
can come with either SDRAM or SGRAM. So far, the driver checked for
SDRAM, which is the common case. The patch moves this code into a
separate helper and checks for SGRAM, which is the special case. The
test itself is the same as before.
