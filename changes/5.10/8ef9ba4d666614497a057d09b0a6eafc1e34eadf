IPv6: Set SIT tunnel hard_header_len to zero

Due to the legacy usage of hard_header_len for SIT tunnels while
already using infrastructure from net/ipv4/ip_tunnel.c the
calculation of the path MTU in tnl_update_pmtu is incorrect.
This leads to unnecessary creation of MTU exceptions for any
flow going over a SIT tunnel.

As SIT tunnels do not have a header themsevles other than their
transport (L3, L2) headers we're leaving hard_header_len set to zero
as tnl_update_pmtu is already taking care of the transport headers
sizes.

This will also help avoiding unnecessary IPv6 GC runs and spinlock
contention seen when using SIT tunnels and for more than
net.ipv6.route.gc_thresh flows.
