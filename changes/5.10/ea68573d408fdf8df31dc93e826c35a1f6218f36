drm/amdgpu: Fail to load on RAVEN if SME is active

Due to hardware bugs, scatter/gather display on raven requires
a 1:1 IOMMU mapping, however, SME (System Memory Encryption)
requires an indirect IOMMU mapping because the encryption bit
is beyond the DMA mask of the chip.  As such, the two are
incompatible.
