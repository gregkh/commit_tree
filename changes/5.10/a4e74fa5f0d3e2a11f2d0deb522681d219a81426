kcsan: Simplify constant string handling

Simplify checking prefixes and length calculation of constant strings.
For the former, the kernel provides str_has_prefix(), and the latter we
should just use strlen("..") because GCC and Clang have optimizations
that optimize these into constants.

No functional change intended.
