arm64: entry: move enter_from_user_mode to entry-common.c

In later patches we'll want to extend enter_from_user_mode() and add a
corresponding exit_to_user_mode(). As these will be common for all
entries/exits from userspace, it'd be better for these to live in
entry-common.c with the rest of the entry logic.

This patch moves enter_from_user_mode() into entry-common.c. As with
other functions in entry-common.c it is marked as noinstr (which
prevents all instrumentation, tracing, and kprobes) but there are no
other functional changes.
