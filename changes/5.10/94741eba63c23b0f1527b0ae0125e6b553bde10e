ASoC: fsl_sai: Refine enable/disable TE/RE sequence in trigger()

Current code enables TCSR.TE and RCSR.RE together, and disable
TCSR.TE and RCSR.RE together in trigger(), which only supports
one operation modeï¼š
1. Rx synchronous with Tx: TE is last enabled and first disabled

Other operation mode need to be considered also:
2. Tx synchronous with Rx: RE is last enabled and first disabled.
3. Asynchronous mode: Tx and Rx are independent.

So the enable TCSR.TE and RCSR.RE sequence and the disable
sequence need to be refined accordingly for #2 and #3.

There is slightly against what RM recommennds with this change.
For example in Rx synchronous with Tx mode, case "aplay 1.wav;
arecord 2.wav" enable TE before RE. But it should be safe to
do so, judging by years of testing results.
