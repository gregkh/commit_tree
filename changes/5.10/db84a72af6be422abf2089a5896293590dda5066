blk-iocost: clamp inuse and skip noops in __propagate_weights()

__propagate_weights() currently expects the callers to clamp inuse within
[1, active], which is needlessly fragile. The inuse adjustment logic is
going to be revamped, in preparation, let's make __propagate_weights() clamp
inuse on entry.

Also, make it avoid weight updates altogether if neither active or inuse is
changed.
