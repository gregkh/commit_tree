um: vector: Add dynamic tap interfaces and scripting

Provide functionality roughly compatible with the existing qemu
ifup scripting:
* invocation of an ifup script. The interface name is passed as the
  first and only argument
* allocating tap interfaces on the fly if they are not explicitly
  specified
