kbuild: Only add -fno-var-tracking-assignments for old GCC versions

Some old GCC versions between 4.5.0 and 4.9.1 might miscompile code
with -fvar-tracking-assingments (which is enabled by default with -g -O2).
Commit 2062afb4f804 ("Fix gcc-4.9.0 miscompilation of load_balance()
in scheduler") added -fno-var-tracking-assignments unconditionally to
work around this. But newer versions of GCC no longer have this bug, so
only add it for versions of GCC before 5.0. This allows various tools
such as a perf probe or gdb debuggers or systemtap to resolve variable
locations using dwarf locations in more code.
