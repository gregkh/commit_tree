KVM: selftests: Factor code out of demand_paging_test

Much of the code in demand_paging_test can be reused by other, similar
multi-vCPU-memory-touching-perfromance-tests. Factor that common code
out for reuse.

No functional change expected.

This series was tested by running the following invocations on an Intel
Skylake machine:
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20m -i 100 -v 64
dirty_log_perf_test -b 20g -i 5 -v 4
dirty_log_perf_test -b 4g -i 5 -v 32
demand_paging_test -b 20m -v 64
demand_paging_test -b 20g -v 4
demand_paging_test -b 4g -v 32
All behaved as expected.
