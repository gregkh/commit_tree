fs: do not update nr_thps for mappings which support THPs

The nr_thps counter is to support THPs in the page cache when the
filesystem doesn't understand THPs.  Eventually it will be removed, but we
should still support filesystems which do not understand THPs yet.  Move
the nr_thp manipulation functions to filemap.h since they're page-cache
specific.
