samples: bpf: Replace attach_tracepoint() to attach() in xdp_redirect_cpu

>From commit d7a18ea7e8b6 ("libbpf: Add generic bpf_program__attach()"),
for some BPF programs, it is now possible to attach BPF programs
with __attach() instead of explicitly calling __attach_<type>().

This commit refactors the __attach_tracepoint() with libbpf's generic
__attach() method. In addition, this refactors the logic of setting
the map FD to simplify the code. Also, the missing removal of
bpf_load.o in Makefile has been fixed.
