crypto: picoxcell - Fix potential race condition bug

engine->stat_irq_thresh was initialized after device_create_file() in
the probe function, the initialization may race with call to
spacc_stat_irq_thresh_store() which updates engine->stat_irq_thresh,
therefore initialize it before creating the file in probe function.
