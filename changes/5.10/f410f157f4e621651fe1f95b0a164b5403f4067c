drivers/net/ethernet: add some basic kdoc tags

A couple of drivers had a "generic documentation" section that
would trigger a "can't understand" message from W=1 compiles.

Fix by using correct DOC: tags in the generic sections.

Fixed Warnings:
drivers/net/ethernet/arc/emac_arc.c:4: info: Scanning doc for c
drivers/net/ethernet/cadence/macb_pci.c:3: warning: missing initial short description on line:
 * Cadence GEM PCI wrapper.
