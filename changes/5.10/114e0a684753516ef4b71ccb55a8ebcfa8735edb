arm64: mark idle code as noinstr

Core code disables RCU when calling arch_cpu_idle(), so it's not safe
for arch_cpu_idle() or its calees to be instrumented, as the
instrumentation callbacks may attempt to use RCU or other features which
are unsafe to use in this context.

Mark them noinstr to prevent issues.

The use of local_irq_enable() in arch_cpu_idle() is similarly
problematic, and the "sched/idle: Fix arch_cpu_idle() vs tracing" patch
queued in the tip tree addresses that case.
