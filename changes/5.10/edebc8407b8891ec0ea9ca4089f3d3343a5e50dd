RDMA/rxe: Fix small problem in network_type patch

The patch referenced below has a typo that results in using the wrong L2
header size for outbound traffic. (V4 <-> V6).

It also breaks kernel-side RC traffic because they use AVs that use
RDMA_NETWORK_XXX enums instead of RXE_NETWORK_TYPE_XXX enums. Fix this by
transcoding between these enum types.

Fixes: e0d696d201dd ("RDMA/rxe: Move the definitions for rxe_av.network_type to uAPI")
