s390/kprobes: move insn_page to text segment

Move the in-kernel kprobes insn page to text segment. Rationale:
having that page in rw data segment is suboptimal, since as soon as a
kprobe is set, this will split the 1:1 kernel mapping for a single
page which get new permissions.

Note: there is always at least one kprobe present for the kretprobe
trampoline; so the mapping will always be split into smaller 4k
mappings because of this.

Moving the kprobes insn page into text segment makes sure that the
page is mapped RO/X in any case, and avoids that the 1:1 mapping is
split.

The kprobe insn_page is defined as a dummy function which is filled
with "br %r14" instructions.
