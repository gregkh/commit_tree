PCI/ASPM: Remove struct aspm_register_info.enabled

Previously we stored the "ASPM Control" bits from the Link Control register
in the struct aspm_register_info.

Read PCI_EXP_LNKCTL directly when needed.  This means we can use the
PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_ASPM_* bits directly instead of the similar but different
PCIE_LINK_STATE_* bits.  No functional change intended.

[bhelgaas: drop get_aspm_enable() and read LNKCTL once directly]
