LICENSE: add GFDL deprecated licenses

There are some files under Documentation which uses
deprecated versions of GNU Free Documentation License, on
both versions 1.1 and 1.2.

On all cases, the license is with no Invariant Sections,
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts.

Add the text file for them, as we'll start using SPDX
for those.
