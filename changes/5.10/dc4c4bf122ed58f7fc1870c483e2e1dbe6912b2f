thunderbolt: Optimize Force Power logic

Currently the "Force Power" logic uses 10 retries, each with a delay of
250 ms. Thunderbolt controllers in Ice Lake and Tiger Lake platforms are
found to complete this in the order of 3 ms or so. Since this delay
is in resume path, surplus delay is effectively affecting runtime PM
resume flows.

Decrease the granularity of the delay to 3 ms and increase the number of
retries so we wait maximum of ~1 s which is the recommended timeout.
This should make runtime resume a bit faster.
