kselftests/arm64: add a basic Pointer Authentication test

PAuth signs and verifies return addresses on the stack. It does so by
inserting a Pointer Authentication code (PAC) into some of the unused top
bits of an address. This is achieved by adding paciasp/autiasp instructions
at the beginning and end of a function.

This feature is partially backwards compatible with earlier versions of the
ARM architecture. To coerce the compiler into emitting fully backwards
compatible code the main file is compiled to target an earlier ARM version.
This allows the tests to check for the feature and print meaningful error
messages instead of crashing.

Add a test to verify that corrupting the return address results in a
SIGSEGV on return.
