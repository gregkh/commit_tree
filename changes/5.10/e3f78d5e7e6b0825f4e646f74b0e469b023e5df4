erofs: remove unneeded parameter

After commit 0615090c5044 ("erofs: convert compressed files from
readpages to readahead"), add_to_page_cache_lru() was moved to mm
code, so that in below call path, no page will be cached into
@pagepool list or grabbed from @pagepool list:
- z_erofs_readpage
 - z_erofs_do_read_page
  - preload_compressed_pages
  - erofs_allocpage

Let's get rid of this unneeded @pagepool parameter.
