net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Disallow port 5 to be a DSA CPU port

While the switch driver is written such that port 5 or 8 could be CPU
ports, the use case on Broadcom STB chips is to use port 8 exclusively.
The platform firmware does make port 5 comply to a proper DSA CPU port
binding by specifiying an "ethernet" phandle. This is undesirable for
now until we have an user-space configuration mechanism (such as
devlink) which could support dynamically changing the port flavor at
run time.
