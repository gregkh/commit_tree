nvme: don't call revalidate_disk from nvme_set_queue_dying

In nvme_set_queue_dying we really just want to ensure the disk and bdev
sizes are set to zero.  Going through revalidate_disk leads to a somewhat
arcance and complex callchain relying on special behavior in a few
places.  Instead just lift the set_capacity directly to
nvme_set_queue_dying, and rename and move the nvme_mpath_update_disk_size
helper so that we can use it in nvme_set_queue_dying to propagate the
size to the bdev without detours.
