iio: temperature: mlx90632: Interface to change object ambient temperature

Since object temperature might be different than the sensor temperature
the infrared sensors should provide an interface to inject ambient
temperature. This was in past done via write to ambient temperature
interface (in_temp_ambient_raw), but I think most people did not know
about it. This solution introduces a new iio type of the CALIBAMBIENT
which is hopefully more descriptive and more explicit about the purpose
and capabilities of the sensors.
