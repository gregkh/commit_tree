MIPS: cpu-probe: introduce exclusive R3k CPU probe

Running a kernel on a R3k of machine definitly will never see one of
the newer CPU cores. And since R3k system usually are low on memory
we could save quite some kbytes:

   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  15070	     88	     32	  15190	   3b56	arch/mips/kernel/cpu-probe.o
    844	      4	     16	    864	    360	arch/mips/kernel/cpu-r3k-probe.o
