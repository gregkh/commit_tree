KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: Drop the reporting of GICR_TYPER.Last for userspace

It was recently reported that if GICR_TYPER is accessed before the RD base
address is set, we'll suffer from the unset @rdreg dereferencing. Oops...

	gpa_t last_rdist_typer = rdreg->base + GICR_TYPER +
			(rdreg->free_index - 1) * KVM_VGIC_V3_REDIST_SIZE;

It's "expected" that users will access registers in the redistributor if
the RD has been properly configured (e.g., the RD base address is set). But
it hasn't yet been covered by the existing documentation.

Per discussion on the list [1], the reporting of the GICR_TYPER.Last bit
for userspace never actually worked. And it's difficult for us to emulate
it correctly given that userspace has the flexibility to access it any
time. Let's just drop the reporting of the Last bit for userspace for now
(userspace should have full knowledge about it anyway) and it at least
prevents kernel from panic ;-)
