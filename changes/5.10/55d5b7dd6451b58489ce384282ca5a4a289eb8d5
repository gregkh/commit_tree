initramfs: fix clang build failure

There is only one function in init/initramfs.c that is in the .text
section, and it is marked __weak.  When building with clang-12 and the
integrated assembler, this leads to a bug with recordmcount:

  ./scripts/recordmcount  "init/initramfs.o"
  Cannot find symbol for section 2: .text.
  init/initramfs.o: failed

I'm not quite sure what exactly goes wrong, but I notice that this
function is only ever called from an __init function, and normally
inlined.  Marking it __init as well is clearly correct and it leads to
recordmcount no longer complaining.
