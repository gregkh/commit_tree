scripts: get_abi.pl: improve its parser to better catch up indentation

The original parser for indentation were relying on having
just one description for each "what". However, that's not
the case: there are a number of ABI symbols that got defined
multiple times.

Improve the parser for it to better handle descriptions
if entries are duplicated.
