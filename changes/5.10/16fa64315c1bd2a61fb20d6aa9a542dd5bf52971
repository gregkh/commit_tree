perf/x86/intel/uncore: Factor out uncore_pci_pmu_register()

The PMU registration in the uncore PCI sub driver is similar as the
normal PMU registration for a PCI device. The codes to register a PCI
PMU can be shared.

Factor out uncore_pci_pmu_register(), which will be used later.

The pci_set_drvdata() is not included in uncore_pci_pmu_register(). The
uncore PCI sub driver doesn't own the PCI device. It will not touch the
private driver data pointer for the device.
