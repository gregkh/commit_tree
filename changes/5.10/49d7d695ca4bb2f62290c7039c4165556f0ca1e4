spi: dw: Explicitly de-assert CS on SPI transfer completion

By design of the currently available native set_cs callback, the CS
de-assertion will be done only if it's required by the corresponding
controller capability. But in order to pre-fill the Tx FIFO buffer with
data during the SPI memory ops execution the SER register needs to be left
cleared before that. We'll also need a way to explicitly set and clear the
corresponding CS bit at a certain moment of the operation. Let's alter
the set_cs function then to also de-activate the CS, when it's required.
