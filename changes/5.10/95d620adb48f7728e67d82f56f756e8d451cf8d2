drm/amd/display: HDMI remote sink need mode validation for Linux

[Why]
Currently mode validation is bypassed if remote sink exists. That
leads to mode set issue when a BW bottle neck exists in the link path,
e.g., a DP-to-HDMI converter that only supports HDMI 1.4.

Any invalid mode passed to Linux user space will cause the modeset
failure due to limitation of Linux user space implementation.

[How]
Mode validation is skipped only if in edid override. For real remote
sink, clock limit check should be done for HDMI remote sink.

Have HDMI related remote sink going through mode validation to
elimiate modes which pixel clock exceeds BW limitation.
