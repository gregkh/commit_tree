can: peak_usb: add range checking in decode operations

These values come from skb->data so Smatch considers them untrusted.  I
believe Smatch is correct but I don't have a way to test this.

The usb_if->dev[] array has 2 elements but the index is in the 0-15
range without checks.  The cfd->len can be up to 255 but the maximum
valid size is CANFD_MAX_DLEN (64) so that could lead to memory
corruption.
