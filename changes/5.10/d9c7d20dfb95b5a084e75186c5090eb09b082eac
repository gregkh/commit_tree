net: hns3: replace the macro of max tm rate with the queried specification

The max tm rate is a fixed value(100Gb/s) now as it is defined by a
macro. In order to support other rates in different kinds of device,
it is better to use specification queried from firmware to replace
this macro.

As function hclge_shaper_para_calc() has too many arguments to add
more, so encapsulate its three arguments ir_b, ir_u, ir_s into a
structure.
