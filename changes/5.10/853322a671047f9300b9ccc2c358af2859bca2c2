mm/debug.c: do not dereference i_ino blindly

__dump_page() checks i_dentry is fetchable and i_ino is earlier in the
struct than i_ino, so it ought to work fine, but it's possible that struct
randomisation has reordered i_ino after i_dentry and the pointer is just
wild enough that i_dentry is fetchable and i_ino isn't.

Also print the inode number if the dentry is invalid.
