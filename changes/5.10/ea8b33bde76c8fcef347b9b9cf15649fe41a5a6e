can: pcan_usb: add support of rxerr/txerr counters

This patch adds the support of the rx/tx errors CAN counters to the
driver of the PCAN-USB PC-CAN interface from PEAK-System GmbH.

The PCAN-USB is capable of giving back the values of the rx/tx errors
counters, to provide more details and statistics to the linux-can layer.
Getting these values allows the driver to better tune CAN_ERR_CRTL_TX_xxx
and CAN_ERR_CRTL_RX_xxx bits in case of the interface enters any
CAN_STATE_ERROR_xxx state.
