tty: make FONTX ioctl use the tty pointer they were actually passed

Some of the font tty ioctl's always used the current foreground VC for
their operations.  Don't do that then.

This fixes a data race on fg_console.

Side note: both Michael Ellerman and Jiri Slaby point out that all these
ioctls are deprecated, and should probably have been removed long ago,
and everything seems to be using the KDFONTOP ioctl instead.

In fact, Michael points out that it looks like busybox's loadfont
program seems to have switched over to using KDFONTOP exactly _because_
of this bug (ahem.. 12 years ago ;-).
