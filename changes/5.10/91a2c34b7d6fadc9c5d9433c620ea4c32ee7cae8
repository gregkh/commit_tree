KVM: arm64: Force PTE mapping on fault resulting in a device mapping

VFIO allows a device driver to resolve a fault by mapping a MMIO
range. This can be subsequently result in user_mem_abort() to
try and compute a huge mapping based on the MMIO pfn, which is
a sure recipe for things to go wrong.

Instead, force a PTE mapping when the pfn faulted in has a device
mapping.
