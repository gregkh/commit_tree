scsi: qedi: Add support for handling PCIe errors

The error recovery is handled by management firmware (MFW) with the help of
qed/qedi drivers. Upon detecting errors, driver informs MFW about this
event which in turn starts a recovery process. MFW sends ERROR_RECOVERY
notification to the driver which performs the required cleanup/recovery
from the driver side.
