ext4: discard preallocations before releasing group lock

ext4_mb_discard_group_preallocations() can be releasing group lock with
preallocations accumulated on its local list. Thus although
discard_pa_seq was incremented and concurrent allocating processes will
be retrying allocations, it can happen that premature ENOSPC error is
returned because blocks used for preallocations are not available for
reuse yet. Make sure we always free locally accumulated preallocations
before releasing group lock.
