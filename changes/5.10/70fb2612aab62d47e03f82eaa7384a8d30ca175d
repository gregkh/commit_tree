fscrypt: don't call no-key names "ciphertext names"

Currently we're using the term "ciphertext name" ambiguously because it
can mean either the actual ciphertext filename, or the encoded filename
that is shown when an encrypted directory is listed without its key.
The latter we're now usually calling the "no-key name"; and while it's
derived from the ciphertext name, it's not the same thing.

To avoid this ambiguity, rename fscrypt_name::is_ciphertext_name to
fscrypt_name::is_nokey_name, and update comments that say "ciphertext
name" (or "encrypted name") to say "no-key name" instead when warranted.
