crypto: inside-secure - Prevent missing of processing errors

On systems with coherence issues, packet processed could succeed while
it should have failed, e.g. because of an authentication fail.
This is because the driver would read stale status information that had
all error bits initialised to zero = no error.
Since this is potential a security risk, we want to prevent it from being
a possibility at all. So initialize all error bits to error state, so
that reading stale status information will always result in errors.
