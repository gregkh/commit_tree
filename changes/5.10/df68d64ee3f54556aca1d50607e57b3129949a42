net: openvswitch: refactor flow free function

Decrease table->count and ufid_count unconditionally,
because we only don't use count or ufid_count to count
when flushing the flows. To simplify the codes, we
remove the "count" argument of table_instance_flow_free.

To avoid a bug when deleting flows in the future, add
WARN_ON in flush flows function.
