Input: allocate keycodes for notification-center, pickup-phone and hangup-phone

New Lenovo Thinkpad models, e.g. the X1 Carbon 8th gen and the new T14 gen1
models have 3 new symbols / shortcuts on their F9-F11 keys (and the
thinkpad_acpi driver receives 3 new "scancodes" for these):

F9:  Has a symbol resembling a rectangular speech balloon, the manual says
     the hotkey functions shows or hides the notification center
F10: Has a symbol of a telephone horn which has been picked up from the
     receiver, the manual says: "Answer incoming calls"
F11: Has a symbol of a telephone horn which is resting on the receiver,
     the manual says: "Decline incoming calls"

We have no existing keycodes which are a good match for these, so
add 3 new keycodes for these.

I noticed that we have a hole in our keycodes between 0x1ba and 0x1c0
which does not seem to be reserved for any specific purpose, so these
new 3 codes use 0x1bc - 0x1be, instead of starting at 0x27b.
