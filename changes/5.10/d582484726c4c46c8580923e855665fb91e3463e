mptcp: fix fallback for MP_JOIN subflows

Additional/MP_JOIN subflows that do not pass some initial handshake
tests currently causes fallback to TCP. That is an RFC violation:
we should instead reset the subflow and leave the the msk untouched.

Closes: https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/91
Fixes: f296234c98a8 ("mptcp: Add handling of incoming MP_JOIN requests")
