pinctrl: mcp23s08: Fix mcp23x17 precious range

On page 23 of the datasheet [0] it says "The register remains unchanged
until the interrupt is cleared via a read of INTCAP or GPIO." Include
INTCAPA and INTCAPB registers in precious range, so that they aren't
accidentally cleared when we read via debugfs.
