usb: dwc3: gadget: Return early if no TRB update

If the transfer had already started and there's no TRB to update, then
there's no need to go through __dwc3_gadget_kick_transfer(). There is
no problem reissuing UPDATE_TRANSFER command. This change just saves
the driver from doing a few operations. This happens when we run out of
TRB and function driver still queues for more requests.
