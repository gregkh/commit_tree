ASoC: core: remove artificial component and DAI name constraint

Current fmt_single_name code limits maximum name of a DAI or component
to 32 bytes. On some systems corresponding device names might be longer
than that (e.g.
17300000.remoteproc:glink-edge:apr:apr-service@8:routing). This will
result in duplicate DAI/component names. Rewrite fmt_single_name() to
remove such length limitations.
