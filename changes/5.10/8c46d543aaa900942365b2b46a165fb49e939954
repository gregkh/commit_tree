PCI: Update mmap-related #ifdef comments

f719582435af ("PCI: Add pci_mmap_resource_range() and use it for ARM64")
changed the #ifdef condition around pci_create_resource_files(),
pci_remove_resource_files(), and related functions, but did not update
comments at the #else and #ifdef.

Update the comments to match the #ifdef.

[bhelgaas: commit log, drop #endif comment since it's close to the #else]
