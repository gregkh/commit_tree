coresight: cti: Allow cti to be built as a module

Allow to build coresight-cti as a module, for ease of development.

- Kconfig becomes a tristate, to allow =m
- append -core to source file name to allow module to
  be called coresight-cti by the Makefile
- add an cti_remove function, for module unload
- add a MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE for autoloading on boot
- move cti_remove_conn_xrefs to cti_remove since all sysfs links
  have gone when system calls device_release.
