mtd: rawnand: ifc: Move the ECC engine initialization to the right place

No ECC initialization should happen during the host controller probe.

In fact, we need the probe function to call nand_scan() in order to:
- identify the device, its capabilities and constraints (nand_scan_ident())
- configure the ECC engine accordingly (->attach_chip())
- scan its content and prepare the core (nand_scan_tail())

Moving these lines to fsl_ifc_attach_chip() fixes a regression caused by
a previous commit supposed to clarify these steps.

Based on a fix done for the mxc_nand driver by Miquel Raynal.
