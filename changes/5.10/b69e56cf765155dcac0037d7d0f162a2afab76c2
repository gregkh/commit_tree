samples/bpf: Fix to xdpsock to avoid recycling frames

The txpush program in the xdpsock sample application is supposed
to send out all packets in the umem in a round-robin fashion.
The problem is that it only cycled through the first BATCH_SIZE
worth of packets. Fixed this so that it cycles through all buffers
in the umem as intended.
