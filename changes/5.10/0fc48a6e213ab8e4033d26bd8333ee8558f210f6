mm/mmap: check on file instead of the rb_root_cached of its address_space

In __vma_adjust(), we do the check on *root* to decide whether to adjust
the address_space.  It seems to be more meaningful to do the check on
*file* itself.  This means we are adjusting some data because it is a file
backed vma.

Since we seem to assume the address_space is valid if it is a file backed
vma, let's just replace *root* with *file* here.
