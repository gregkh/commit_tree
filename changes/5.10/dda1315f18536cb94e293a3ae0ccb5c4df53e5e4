blk-iocost: halve debts if device stays idle

A low weight iocg can amass a large amount of debt, for example, when
anonymous memory gets reclaimed aggressively. If the system has a lot of
memory paired with a slow IO device, the debt can span multiple seconds or
more. If there are no other subsequent IO issuers, the in-debt iocg may end
up blocked paying its debt while the IO device is idle.

This patch implements a mechanism to protect against such pathological
cases. If the device has been sufficiently idle for a substantial amount of
time, the debts are halved. The criteria are on the conservative side as we
want to resolve the rare extreme cases without impacting regular operation
by forgiving debts too readily.
