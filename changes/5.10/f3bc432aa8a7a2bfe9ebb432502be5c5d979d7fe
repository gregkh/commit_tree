USB: core: Change %pK for __user pointers to %px

Commit 2f964780c03b ("USB: core: replace %p with %pK") used the %pK
format specifier for a bunch of __user pointers.  But as the 'K' in
the specifier indicates, it is meant for kernel pointers.  The reason
for the %pK specifier is to avoid leaks of kernel addresses, but when
the pointer is to an address in userspace the security implications
are minimal.  In particular, no kernel information is leaked.

This patch changes the __user %pK specifiers (used in a bunch of
debugging output lines) to %px, which will always print the actual
address with no mangling.  (Notably, there is no printk format
specifier particularly intended for __user pointers.)
