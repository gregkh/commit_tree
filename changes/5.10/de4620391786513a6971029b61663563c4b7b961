thunderbolt: Configure link after lane bonding is enabled

During testing it was noticed that the link is not properly restored
after the domain exits sleep if the link configured bits are set before
lane bonding is enabled. The USB4 spec does not say in which order these
need to be set but setting link configured afterwards makes the link
restoration work so we do that instead.
