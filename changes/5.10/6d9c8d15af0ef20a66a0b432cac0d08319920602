net/mlx4_core: Fix init_hca fields offset

Slave function read the following capabilities from the wrong offset:
1. log_mc_entry_sz
2. fs_log_entry_sz
3. log_mc_hash_sz

Fix that by adjusting these capabilities offset to match firmware
layout.

Due to the wrong offset read, the following issues might occur:
1+2. Negative value reported at max_mcast_qp_attach.
3. Driver to init FW with multicast hash size of zero.
