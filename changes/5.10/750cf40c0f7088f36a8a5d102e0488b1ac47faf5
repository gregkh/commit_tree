soc: fsl: qbman: Fix return value on success

On error the function was meant to return -ERRNO.  This also fixes
compile warning:

  drivers/soc/fsl/qbman/bman.c:640:6: warning: variable 'err' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Fixes: 0505d00c8dba ("soc/fsl/qbman: Cleanup buffer pools if BMan was initialized prior to bootup")
