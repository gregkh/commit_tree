ext4: drop fast_commit from /proc/mounts

The options in /proc/mounts must be valid mount options --- and
fast_commit is not a mount option.  Otherwise, command sequences like
this will fail:

    # mount /dev/vdc /vdc
    # mkdir -p /vdc/phoronix_test_suite /pts
    # mount --bind /vdc/phoronix_test_suite /pts
    # mount -o remount,nodioread_nolock /pts
    mount: /pts: mount point not mounted or bad option.

And in the system logs, you'll find:

    EXT4-fs (vdc): Unrecognized mount option "fast_commit" or missing value
