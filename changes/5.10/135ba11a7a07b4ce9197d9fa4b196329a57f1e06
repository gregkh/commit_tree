dma-mapping: set default segment_boundary_mask to ULONG_MAX

The default segment_boundary_mask was set to DMA_BIT_MAKS(32)
a decade ago by referencing SCSI/block subsystem, as a 32-bit
mask was good enough for most of the devices.

Now more and more drivers set dma_masks above DMA_BIT_MAKS(32)
while only a handful of them call dma_set_seg_boundary(). This
means that most drivers have a 4GB segmention boundary because
DMA API returns a 32-bit default value, though they might not
really have such a limit.

The default segment_boundary_mask should mean "no limit" since
the device doesn't explicitly set the mask. But a 32-bit mask
certainly limits those devices capable of 32+ bits addressing.

So this patch sets default segment_boundary_mask to ULONG_MAX.
