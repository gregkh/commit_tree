selftests/livepatch: Do not check order when using "comm" for dmesg checking

check_result() uses "comm" to check expected results of selftests output
in dmesg. Everything works fine if timestamps in dmesg are unique. If
not, like in this example

[   86.844422] test_klp_callbacks_demo: pre_unpatch_callback: test_klp_callbacks_mod -> [MODULE_STATE_LIVE] Normal state
[   86.844422] livepatch: 'test_klp_callbacks_demo': starting unpatching transition

, "comm" fails with "comm: file 2 is not in sorted order". Suppress the
order checking with --nocheck-order option.
