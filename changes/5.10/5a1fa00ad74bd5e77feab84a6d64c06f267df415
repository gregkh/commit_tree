ASoC: SOF: sof-of-dev: Add .arch_ops field

Add .arch_ops field in the sof_imx8x_ops structure.
The inclusion of this field will allow the usage of functions from
sof/core.c in order to print debug information such as the registers and
a stack dump in case of a firmware ops.

The SND_SOC_SOF_XTENSA is added in the imx/Kconfig file so the compilation
is successful.
