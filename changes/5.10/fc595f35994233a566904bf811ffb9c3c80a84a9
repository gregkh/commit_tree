KVM: nVMX: Add VM-Enter failed tracepoints for super early checks

Add tracepoints for the early consistency checks in nested_vmx_run().
The "VMLAUNCH vs. VMRESUME" check in particular is useful to trace, as
there is no architectural way to check VMCS.LAUNCH_STATE, and subtle
bugs such as VMCLEAR on the wrong HPA can lead to confusing errors in
the L1 VMM.
