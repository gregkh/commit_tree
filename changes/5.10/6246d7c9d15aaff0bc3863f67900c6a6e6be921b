mmc: block: Fixup condition for CMD13 polling for RPMB requests

The CMD13 polling is needed for commands with R1B responses. In commit
a0d4c7eb71dd ("mmc: block: Add CMD13 polling for MMC IOCTLS with R1B
response"), the intent was to introduce this for requests targeted to the
RPMB partition. However, the condition to trigger the polling loop became
wrong, leading to unnecessary polling. Let's fix the condition to avoid
this.
