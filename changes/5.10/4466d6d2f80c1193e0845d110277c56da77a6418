tty: fix crash in release_tty if tty->port is not set

Commit 2ae0b31e0face ("tty: don't crash in tty_init_dev when missing
tty_port") didn't fully prevent the crash as the cleanup path in
tty_init_dev() calls release_tty() which dereferences tty->port
without checking it for non-null.

Add tty->port checks to release_tty to avoid the kernel crash.
