irqchip/gic-v3: Spell out when pseudo-NMIs are enabled

When NMIs cannot be enabled, the driver prints a message stating that
unambiguously. When they are enabled, the only feedback we get is a message
regarding the use of synchronization for ICC_PMR_EL1 writes, which is not
as useful for a user who is not intimately familiar with how NMIs are
implemented.

Let's make it obvious that pseudo-NMIs are enabled. Keep the message about
using a barrier for ICC_PMR_EL1 writes, because it has a non-negligible
impact on performance.
