perf stat: Support new per thread TopDown metrics

Icelake has support for reporting per thread TopDown metrics.

These are reported differently than the previous TopDown support,
each metric is standalone, but scaled to pipeline "slots".

We don't need to do anything special for HyperThreading anymore.
Teach perf stat --topdown to handle these new metrics and
print them in the same way as the previous TopDown metrics.

The restrictions of only being able to report information per core is
gone.
