ARM: dts: arm: Fix SP805 clocks

The SP805 binding sets the name for the actual watchdog clock to
"wdog_clk" (with an underscore).

Change the name in the DTs for ARM Ltd. platforms to match that. The
Linux and U-Boot driver use the *first* clock for this purpose anyway,
so it does not break anything.

For MPS2 we only specify one clock so far, but the binding requires
two clocks to be named.

In practice, Linux would pick a clock named "apb_pclk" for the bus
clock, and the Linux and U-Boot SP805 driver would use the first clock
to derive the actual watchdog counter frequency. So since currently both
are the very same clock, we can just double the clock reference, and add
the correct clock-names, to match the binding.
