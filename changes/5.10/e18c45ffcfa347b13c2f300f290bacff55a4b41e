mm: move PageDoubleMap bit

Patch series "Fix PageDoubleMap".

This is a purely theoretical problem for now as none of the filesystems
which use PG_private_2 (ie PG_fscache) are being converted at this time,
but it's confusing to leave it like this.

This patch (of 2):

PG_private_2 is defined as being PF_ANY (applicable to tail pages as well
as regular & head pages).  That means that the first tail page of a
double-map page will appear to have Private2 set.  Use the Workingset bit
instead which is defined as PF_HEAD so any attempt to access the
Workingset bit on a tail page will redirect to the head page's Workingset
bit.
