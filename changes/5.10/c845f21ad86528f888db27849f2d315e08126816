regulator: Make constraint debug processing conditional on DEBUG

If debugging is disabled, print_constraints() does not print the actual
constraints, but still performs some processing and string formatting,
only to throw away the result later.

Fix this by moving all constraint debug processing to a separate
function, and replacing it by a dummy when debugging is disabled.
This reduces kernel size by almost 800 bytes (on arm/arm64).
