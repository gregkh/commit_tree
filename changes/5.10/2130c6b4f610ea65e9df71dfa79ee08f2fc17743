nocb: Remove show_rcu_nocb_state() false positive printout

The rcu_data structure's ->nocb_timer field is used to defer wakeups of
the corresponding no-CBs CPU's grace-period kthread ("rcuog*"), and that
structure's ->nocb_defer_wakeup field is used to track such deferral.
This means that the show_rcu_nocb_state() printing an error when those
fields are set for a CPU not corresponding to a no-CBs grace-period
kthread is erroneous.

This commit therefore switches the check from ->nocb_timer to
->nocb_bypass_timer and removes the check of ->nocb_defer_wakeup.
