EDAC: Replace HTTP links with HTTPS ones

Rationale:
Reduces attack surface on kernel devs opening the links for MITM
as HTTPS traffic is much harder to manipulate.

  Deterministic algorithm:
  For each file:
    If not .svg:
      For each line:
        If doesn't contain `\bxmlns\b`:
          For each link, `\bhttp://[^# \t\r\n]*(?:\w|/)`:
  	  If neither `\bgnu\.org/license`, nor `\bmozilla\.org/MPL\b`:
              If both the HTTP and HTTPS versions
              return 200 OK and serve the same content:
                Replace HTTP with HTTPS.
