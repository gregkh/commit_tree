i3c: master add i3c_master_attach_boardinfo to preserve boardinfo

Boardinfo was lost if I3C object for devices with boardinfo
available are not created or not added to the I3C device list
because of some failure e.g. SETDASA failed, retrieve info failed etc
This patch adds i3c_master_attach_boardinfo which scan boardinfo list
in the master object and 'attach' it to the I3C device object.
