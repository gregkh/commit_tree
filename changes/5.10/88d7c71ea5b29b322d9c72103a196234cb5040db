soundwire: bus: update multi-link definition with hw sync details

Hardware-based synchronization is typically required when the
bus->multi_link flag is set.

On Intel platforms, when the Cadence IP is configured in 'Multi Master
Mode', the hardware synchronization is required even when a stream
only uses a single segment. The existing code only deal with hardware
synchronization when a stream uses more than one segment so to remain
backwards compatible we add a configuration threshold. For Intel cases
this threshold will be set to one, other platforms may be able to use
the SSP-based sync in those cases.
