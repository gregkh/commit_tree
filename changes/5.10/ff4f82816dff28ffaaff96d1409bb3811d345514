x86/cpufeatures: Enumerate ENQCMD and ENQCMDS instructions

Work submission instruction comes in two flavors. ENQCMD can be called
both in ring 3 and ring 0 and always uses the contents of a PASID MSR
when shipping the command to the device. ENQCMDS allows a kernel driver
to submit commands on behalf of a user process. The driver supplies the
PASID value in ENQCMDS. There isn't any usage of ENQCMD in the kernel as
of now.

The CPU feature flag is shown as "enqcmd" in /proc/cpuinfo.
