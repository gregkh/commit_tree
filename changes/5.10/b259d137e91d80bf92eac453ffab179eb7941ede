KVM: arm64: Pass level hint to TLBI during stage-2 permission fault

Alex pointed out that we don't pass a level hint to the TLBI instruction
when handling a stage-2 permission fault, even though the walker does
at some point have the level information in its hands.

Rework stage2_update_leaf_attrs() so that it can optionally return the
level of the updated pte to its caller, which can in turn be used to
provide the correct TLBI level hint.
