Bluetooth: Fix auto-creation of hci_conn at Conn Complete event

Currently the code auto-creates hci_conn only if the remote address has
been discovered before. This may not be the case. For example, the
remote device may trigger connection after reboot at already-paired
state so there is no inquiry result found, but it is still correct to
create the hci_conn when Connection Complete event is received.

A better guard is to check against bredr allowlist. Devices in the
allowlist have been given permission to auto-connect.
