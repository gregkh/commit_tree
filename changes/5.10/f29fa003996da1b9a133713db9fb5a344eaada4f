net/smc: restore smcd_version when all ISM V2 devices failed to init

Field ini->smcd_version is set to SMC_V2 before calling
smc_listen_ism_init(). This clears the V1 bit that may be set. When all
matching ISM V2 devices fail to initialize then the smcd_version field
needs to get restored to allow any possible V1 devices to initialize.
And be consistent, always go to the not_found label when no device was
found.
