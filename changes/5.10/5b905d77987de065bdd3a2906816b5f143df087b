powerpc/watchpoint: Fix exception handling for CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT=N

On powerpc, ptrace watchpoint works in one-shot mode. i.e. kernel
disables event every time it fires and user has to re-enable it.
Also, in case of ptrace watchpoint, kernel notifies ptrace user
before executing instruction.

With CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT=N, kernel is missing to disable
ptrace event and thus it's causing infinite loop of exceptions.
This is especially harmful when user watches on a data which is
also read/written by kernel, eg syscall parameters. In such case,
infinite exceptions happens in kernel mode which causes soft-lockup.
