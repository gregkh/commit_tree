bpf: Generalize caching for sk_storage.

Provide the a ability to define local storage caches on a per-object
type basis. The caches and caching indices for different objects should
not be inter-mixed as suggested in:

  https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20200630193441.kdwnkestulg5erii@kafai-mbp.dhcp.thefacebook.com/

  "Caching a sk-storage at idx=0 of a sk should not stop an
  inode-storage to be cached at the same idx of a inode."
