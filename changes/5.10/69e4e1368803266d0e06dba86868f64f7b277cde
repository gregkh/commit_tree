gpiolib: cdev: replace strncpy() with strscpy()

Replace usage of strncpy() with strscpy() to remove -Wstringop-truncation
warnings.

The structures being populated are zeroed, to prevent stack leakage as
they are returned to userspace, so strscpy() performs the equivalent
function without the warnings.
