libbpf: Normalize and improve logging across few functions

Make libbpf logs follow similar pattern and provide more context like section
name or program name, where appropriate. Also, add BPF_INSN_SZ constant and
use it throughout to clean up code a little bit. This commit doesn't have any
functional changes and just removes some code changes out of the way before
bigger refactoring in libbpf internals.
