gfs2: Fix deadlock dumping resource group glocks

Commit 0e539ca1bbbe ("gfs2: Fix NULL pointer dereference in gfs2_rgrp_dump")
introduced additional locking in gfs2_rgrp_go_dump, which is also used for
dumping resource group glocks via debugfs.  However, on that code path, the
glock spin lock is already taken in dump_glock, and taking it again in
gfs2_glock2rgrp leads to deadlock.  This can be reproduced with:

  $ mkfs.gfs2 -O -p lock_nolock /dev/FOO
  $ mount /dev/FOO /mnt/foo
  $ touch /mnt/foo/bar
  $ cat /sys/kernel/debug/gfs2/FOO/glocks

Fix that by not taking the glock spin lock inside the go_dump callback.
