NFSD: Encode a full READ_PLUS reply

Reply to the client with multiple hole and data segments. I use the
result of the first vfs_llseek() call for encoding as an optimization so
we don't have to immediately repeat the call. This also lets us encode
any remaining reply as data if we get an unexpected result while trying
to calculate a hole.
