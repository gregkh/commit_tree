btrfs: handle errors in btrfs_sysfs_add_fs_devices

btrfs_sysfs_add_fs_devices() is called by btrfs_sysfs_add_mounted().
btrfs_sysfs_add_mounted() assumes that btrfs_sysfs_add_fs_devices() will
either add sysfs entries for all the devices or none. So this patch keeps up
to its caller expecatation and cleans up the created sysfs entries if it
has to fail at some device in the list.
