HID: logitech-dj: Fix Dinovo Mini when paired with a MX5x00 receiver

Some users are pairing the Dinovo keyboards with the MX5000 or MX5500
receivers, instead of with the Dinovo receivers. The receivers are
mostly the same (and the air protocol obviously is compatible) but
currently the Dinovo receivers are handled by hid-lg.c while the
MX5x00 receivers are handled by logitech-dj.c.

When using a Dinovo keyboard, with its builtin touchpad, through
logitech-dj.c then the touchpad stops working because when asking the
receiver for paired devices, we get only 1 paired device with
a device_type of REPORT_TYPE_KEYBOARD. And since we don't see a paired
mouse, we have nowhere to send mouse-events to, so we drop them.

Extend the existing fix for the Dinovo Edge for this to also cover the
Dinovo Mini keyboard and also add a mapping to logitech-hidpp for the
Media key on the Dinovo Mini, so that that keeps working too.
