s390/cpum_sf.c: fix file permission for cpum_sfb_size

This file is installed by the s390 CPU Measurement sampling
facility device driver to export supported minimum and
maximum sample buffer sizes.
This file is read by lscpumf tool to display the details
of the device driver capabilities. The lscpumf tool might
be invoked by a non-root user. In this case it does not
print anything because the file contents can not be read.

Fix this by allowing read access for all users. Reading
the file contents is ok, changing the file contents is
left to the root user only.
