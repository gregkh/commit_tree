nfc: s3fwrn5: Remove wrong vendor prefix from GPIOs

The device tree property prefix describes the vendor, which in case of
S3FWRN5 chip is Samsung.  Therefore the "s3fwrn5" prefix for "en-gpios"
and "fw-gpios" is not correct and should be deprecated.  Introduce
properly named properties for these GPIOs but still support deprecated
ones.
