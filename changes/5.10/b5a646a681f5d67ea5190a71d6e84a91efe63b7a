selftests/powerpc: Run tm-tmspr test for longer

This test creates some threads, which write to TM SPRs, and then makes
sure the registers maintain the correct values across context switches
and contention with other threads.

But currently the test finishes almost instantaneously, which reduces
the chance of it hitting an interesting condition.

So increase the number of loops, so it runs a bit longer, though still
less than 2s on a Power8.
