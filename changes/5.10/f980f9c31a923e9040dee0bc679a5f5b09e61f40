x86/sev-es: Compile early handler code into kernel image

Setup sev-es.c and include the code from the pre-decompression stage
to also build it into the image of the running kernel. Temporarily add
__maybe_unused annotations to avoid build warnings until the functions
get used.

 [ bp: Use the non-tracing rd/wrmsr variants because:
   vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: __sev_es_nmi_complete()+0x11f: \
	   call to do_trace_write_msr() leaves .noinstr.text section
   as __sev_es_nmi_complete() is noinstr due to being called from the
   NMI handler exc_nmi(). ]
