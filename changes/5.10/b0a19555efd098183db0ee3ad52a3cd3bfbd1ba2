x86/msi: Move compose message callback where it belongs

Composing the MSI message at the MSI chip level is wrong because the
underlying parent domain is the one which knows how the message should be
composed for the direct vector delivery or the interrupt remapping table
entry.

The interrupt remapping aware PCI/MSI chip does that already. Make the
direct delivery chip do the same and move the composition of the direct
delivery MSI message to the vector domain irq chip.

This prepares for the upcoming device MSI support to avoid having
architecture specific knowledge in the device MSI domain irq chips.
