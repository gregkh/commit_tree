igc: Reject schedules with a base_time in the future

When we set the BASET registers of i225 with a base_time in the
future, i225 will "hold" all packets until that base_time is reached,
causing a lot of TX Hangs.

As this behaviour seems contrary to the expectations of the IEEE
802.1Q standard (section 8.6.9, especially 8.6.9.4.5), let's start by
rejecting these types of schedules. If this is too limiting, we can
for example, setup a timer to configure the BASET registers closer to
the start time, only blocking the packets for a "short" while.
