drm/i915: Add ww locking to pin_to_display_plane, v2.

Use ww locking for pin_to_display_plane for all the pinning and locking.
With the locking removed from set_cache_level, we need to fix
i915_gem_set_caching_ioctl to take the object reservation lock.

As this is a single lock, we don't need to use the ww dance.

Changes since v1:
- Do not use ww locking in i915_gem_set_caching_ioctl (Thomas).
