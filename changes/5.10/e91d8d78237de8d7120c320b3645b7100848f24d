mm/zsmalloc.c: drop ZSMALLOC_PGTABLE_MAPPING

While I was doing zram testing, I found sometimes decompression failed
since the compression buffer was corrupted.  With investigation, I found
below commit calls cond_resched unconditionally so it could make a
problem in atomic context if the task is reschedule.

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at mm/vmalloc.c:108

We can fix this by removing the ZSMALLOC_PGTABLE_MAPPING feature (which
contains the offending calling code) from zsmalloc.

Even though this option showed some amount improvement(e.g., 30%) in
some arm32 platforms, it has been headache to maintain since it have
abused APIs[1](e.g., unmap_kernel_range in atomic context).

Since we are approaching to deprecate 32bit machines and already made
the config option available for only builtin build since v5.8, lastly it
has been not default option in zsmalloc, it's time to drop the option
for better maintenance.
