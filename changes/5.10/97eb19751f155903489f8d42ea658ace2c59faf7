blk-iocost: add absolute usage stat

Currently, iocost doesn't collect or expose any statistics punting off all
monitoring duties to drgn based iocost_monitor.py. While it works for some
scenarios, there are some usability and data availability challenges. For
example, accurate per-cgroup usage information can't be tracked by vtime
progression at all and the number available in iocg->usages[] are really
short-term snapshots used for control heuristics with possibly significant
errors.

This patch implements per-cgroup absolute usage stat counter and exposes it
through io.stat along with the current vrate. Usage stat collection and
flushing employ the same method as cgroup rstat on the active iocg's and the
only hot path overhead is preemption toggling and adding to a percpu
counter.
