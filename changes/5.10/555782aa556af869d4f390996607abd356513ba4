cifs: move smb version mount options into fs_context.c

This and related patches which move mount related
code to fs_context.c has the advantage of
shriking the code in fs/cifs/connect.c (which had
the second most lines of code of any of the files
in cifs.ko and was getting harder to read due
to its size) and will also make it easier to
switch over to the new mount API in the future.
