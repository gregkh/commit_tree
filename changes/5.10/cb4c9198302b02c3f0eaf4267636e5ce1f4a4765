btrfs: compression: move declarations to header

The declarations of compression algorithm callbacks are defined in the
.c file as they're used from there. Compiler warns that there are no
declarations for public functions when compiling lzo.c/zlib.c/zstd.c.
Fix that by moving the declarations to the header as it's the common
place for all of them.
