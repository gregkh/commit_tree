fbdev: gxfb: use generic power management

Switch to the new generic framework by updating function signatures and
define a "struct dev_pm_ops" variable to bind PM callbacks. This way we can
remove the legacy .suspend & .resume bindings from "gxfb_driver".

The gxfb_suspend() is designed to function only in the case of Suspend.
Thus, the code was kept inside "if (state.event == PM_EVENT_SUSPEND)"
container. This is because, in the legacy framework, this callback was
invoked even in the event of Freeze and Hibernate. Hence, added the load of
unnecessary function-calls.

The goal can be achieved by binding the callback with only
"gxfb_pm_ops.suspend" in the new framework. This also avoids the step of
checking "if (state.event == PM_EVENT_SUSPEND)" every time the callback is
invoked.
