scripts: kernel-doc: don't mangle with parameter list

While kernel-doc needs to parse parameters in order to
identify its name, it shouldn't be touching the type,
as parsing it is very difficult, and errors happen.

One current error is when parsing this parameter:

	const u32 (*tab)[256]

Found at ./lib/crc32.c, on this function:

	u32 __pure crc32_be_generic (u32 crc, unsigned char const *p, size_t len, const u32 (*tab)[256], u32 polynomial);

The current logic mangles it, producing this output:

	const u32 ( *tab

That's something that it is not recognizeable.

So, instead, let's push the argument as-is, and use it
when printing the function prototype and when describing
each argument.
