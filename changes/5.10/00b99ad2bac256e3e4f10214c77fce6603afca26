crypto: arm/aes-neonbs - Use generic cbc encryption path

Since commit b56f5cbc7e08ec7d31c42fc41e5247677f20b143 ("crypto:
arm/aes-neonbs - resolve fallback cipher at runtime") the CBC
encryption path in aes-neonbs is now identical to that obtained
through the cbc template.  This means that it can simply call
the generic cbc template instead of doing its own thing.

This patch removes the custom encryption path and simply invokes
the generic cbc template.
