selftests: fib_nexthops: Test IPv6 route with group after removing IPv4 nexthops

Test that an IPv6 route can not use a nexthop group with mixed IPv4 and
IPv6 nexthops, but can use it after deleting the IPv4 nexthops.

Output without previous patch:

# ./fib_nexthops.sh -t ipv6_fcnal_runtime

IPv6 functional runtime
