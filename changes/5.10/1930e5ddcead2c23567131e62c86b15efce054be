kvm: x86: reads of restricted pv msrs should also result in #GP

commit 66570e966dd9 ("kvm: x86: only provide PV features if enabled in
guest's CPUID") only protects against disallowed guest writes to KVM
paravirtual msrs, leaving msr reads unchecked. Fix this by enforcing
KVM_CPUID_FEATURES for msr reads as well.
