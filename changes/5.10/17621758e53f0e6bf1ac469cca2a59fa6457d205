media: fsl-viu: Do not redefine out_be32()/in_be32() for CONFIG_M68K

The following W=1 build warning is seen on a m68k:

drivers/media/platform/fsl-viu.c: At top level:
drivers/media/platform/fsl-viu.c:36: warning: "out_be32" redefined
   36 | #define out_be32(v, a) iowrite32be(a, (void __iomem *)v)
      |

./arch/m68k/include/asm/raw_io.h:32: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   32 | #define out_be32(addr,l) (void)((*(__force volatile u32 *) (addr)) = (l))

Avoid the out_be32() and in_be32() redefinitions when building for CONFIG_M68K
in the same way we currently do for CONFIG_PPC and CONFIG_MICROBLAZE.
