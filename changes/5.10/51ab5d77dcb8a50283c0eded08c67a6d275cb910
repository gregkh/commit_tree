ALSA: usb-audio: Properly match with audio interface class

There are a few entries in the quirk table that set the device ID with
USB_DEVICE() macro while having an extra bInterfaceClass field.  But
bInterfaceClass field is never checked unless the proper match_flags
is set, so those may match incorrectly with all interfaces.

Introduce another macro to match with the vid/pid pair and the audio
class interface, and apply it to such entries, so that they can match
properly.
