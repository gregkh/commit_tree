docs: Kconfig/Makefile: add a check for broken ABI files

The files under Documentation/ABI should follow the syntax
as defined at Documentation/ABI/README.

Allow checking if they're following the syntax by running
the ABI parser script on COMPILE_TEST.

With that, when there's a problem with a file under
Documentation/ABI, it would produce a warning like:

	Warning: file ./Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-pci-devices-aer_stats#14:
		What '/sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/aer_stats/aer_rootport_total_err_cor' doesn't have a description
	Warning: file ./Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-pci-devices-aer_stats#21:
		What '/sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/aer_stats/aer_rootport_total_err_fatal' doesn't have a description
