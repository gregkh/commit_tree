ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: reduce verbosity of boot error logs

Previous commits reduced the verbosity of errors during boot
iterations, but there are still a couple remaining which generate
false positives. Errors should only be logged when after last attempt
to download firmware failed.

Duplicating logs and assigning them different levels based on the
iteration number isn't really elegant, use macro as suggested by
Guennadi.
