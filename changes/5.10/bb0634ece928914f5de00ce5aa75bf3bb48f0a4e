usb: core: driver: fix stray tabs in error messages

Commit 8bb54ab573ec ("usbcore: add usb_device_driver definition") added
the printk() calls with the error massages spoilt due to the stray tabs
in the middle. Remove these tabs and convert printk() calls to pr_err()
for consistency with the other code, while at it.
