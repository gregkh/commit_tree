docs: get rid of :c:type explicit declarations for structs

The :c:type:`foo` only works properly with structs before
Sphinx 3.x.

On Sphinx 3.x, structs should now be declared using the
.. c:struct, and referenced via :c:struct tag.

As we now have the automarkup.py macro, that automatically
convert:
	struct foo

into cross-references, let's get rid of that, solving
several warnings when building docs with Sphinx 3.x.
