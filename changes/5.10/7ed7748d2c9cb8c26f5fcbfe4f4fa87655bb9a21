platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Add support for new hotkeys found on X1C8 / T14

New Lenovo Thinkpad models, e.g. the X1 Carbon 8th gen and the new T14 gen1
models have 3 new symbols / shortcuts on their F9-F11 keys (and the
thinkpad_acpi driver receives 3 new hkey events for these):

F9:  Has a symbol resembling a rectangular speech balloon, the manual says
     the hotkey functions shows or hides the notification center
F10: Has a symbol of a telephone horn which has been picked up from the
     receiver, the manual says: "Answer incoming calls"
F11: Has a symbol of a telephone horn which is resting on the receiver,
     the manual says: "Decline incoming calls"

And these Thinkpad models also send a new 0x1316 hkey events when the
Fn + right Shift key-combo is pressed.

This commit adds support for these 4 new hkey events.
