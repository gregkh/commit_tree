btrfs: eliminate total_size parameter from setup_items_for_insert

The value of this argument can be derived from the total_data as it's
simply the value of the data size + size of btrfs_items being touched.
Move the parameter calculation inside the function. This results in a
simpler interface and also a minor size reduction:
