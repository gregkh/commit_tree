xfs: simplify the xfs_buf_ioend_disposition calling convention

Now that all the actual error handling is in a single place,
xfs_buf_ioend_disposition just needs to return true if took ownership of
the buffer, or false if not instead of the tristate.  Also move the
error check back in the caller to optimize for the fast path, and give
the function a better fitting name.
