nexthop: Convert to blocking notification chain

Currently, the only listener of the nexthop notification chain is the
VXLAN driver. Subsequent patches will add more listeners (e.g., device
drivers such as netdevsim) that need to be able to block when processing
notifications.

Therefore, convert the notification chain to a blocking one. This is
safe as notifications are always emitted from process context.
