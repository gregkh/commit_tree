ARM: mstar: Select MStar intc

MediaTek recently introduced support for the MStar interrupt
controller that is also present in some of their chips as well
as the MStar/Sigmastar chips.

Almost all of the peripheral interrupts go through an instance of
this controller in MStar/SigmaStar Arm v7 chips so we want to select
it if CONFIG_ARCH_MSTARV7 is selected.
