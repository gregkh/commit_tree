arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Use IRQ defines, add IRQ types

dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/arm-gic.h has a GIC_SPI define
that allows specifying interrupts more clearly, but right now only
some device nodes in msm8916.dtsi make use of it.
Convert all others to use it.

The same applies to the IRQ_TYPE_* defines in
dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h. Some interrupts were defined
with raw numbers, or even with IRQ_TYPE_NONE (0).
Convert all these to use appropriate IRQ types.
