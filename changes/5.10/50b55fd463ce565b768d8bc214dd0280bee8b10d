ASoC: SOF: use the sof_ipc_comp reserved bytes for extended data

Use the 32bit reserved member of the struct sof_ipc_comp as the extended
data length, this will help to minimize the ABI change for adding new
extended data to the struct sof_ipc_comp, usually only minor ABI version
bump needed for every update with this new solution.
