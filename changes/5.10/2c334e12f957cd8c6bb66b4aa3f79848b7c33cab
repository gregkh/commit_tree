xfs: set xefi_discard when creating a deferred agfl free log intent item

Make sure that we actually initialize xefi_discard when we're scheduling
a deferred free of an AGFL block.  This was (eventually) found by the
UBSAN while I was banging on realtime rmap problems, but it exists in
the upstream codebase.  While we're at it, rearrange the structure to
reduce the struct size from 64 to 56 bytes.
