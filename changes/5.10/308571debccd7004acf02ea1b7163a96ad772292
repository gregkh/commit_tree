RDMA/ucma: Do not use file->mut to lock destroying

The only reader of destroying is inside a handler under the handler_mutex,
so directly use the handler_mutex when setting it instead of the larger
file->mut.

As the refcount could be zero here, and the cm_id already freed, and
additional refcount grab around the locking is required to touch the
cm_id.
