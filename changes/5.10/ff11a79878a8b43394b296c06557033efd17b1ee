arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Improve the uart3 pin config for sc7180-idp

Remove output-high from CTS and TX as this is not really required. During
bringup to fix transfer failures this was added to match with console uart
settings. Probably some boot loader config was missing then. As it is
working fine now, remove it.
