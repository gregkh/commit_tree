powerpc/perf: Add declarations to fix sparse warnings

Sparse warns about all the init functions:
  symbol init_ppc970_pmu was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol init_power5p_pmu was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol init_power5_pmu was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol init_power6_pmu was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol init_power7_pmu was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol init_power9_pmu was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol init_power8_pmu was not declared. Should it be static?
  symbol init_generic_compat_pmu was not declared. Should it be static?

They're already declared in internal.h, so just make sure all the C
files include that directly or indirectly.
