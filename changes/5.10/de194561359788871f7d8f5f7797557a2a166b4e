drm/vc4: kms: Assign a FIFO to enabled CRTCs instead of active

The HVS has three FIFOs that can be assigned to a number of PixelValves
through a mux.

However, changing that FIFO requires that we disable and then enable the
pixelvalve, so we want to assign FIFOs to all the enabled CRTCs, and not
just the active ones.
