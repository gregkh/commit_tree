net/x25: Fix null-ptr-deref in x25_connect

This fixes a regression for blocking connects introduced by commit
4becb7ee5b3d ("net/x25: Fix x25_neigh refcnt leak when x25 disconnect").

The x25->neighbour is already set to "NULL" by x25_disconnect() now,
while a blocking connect is waiting in
x25_wait_for_connection_establishment(). Therefore x25->neighbour must
not be accessed here again and x25->state is also already set to
X25_STATE_0 by x25_disconnect().
