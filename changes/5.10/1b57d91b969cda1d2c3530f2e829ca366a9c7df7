irqchip/gic-v2, v3: Prevent SW resends entirely

The GIC irqchips can now use a HW resend when a retrigger is invoked by
check_irq_resend(). However, should the HW resend fail, check_irq_resend()
will still attempt to trigger a SW resend, which is still a bad idea for
the GICs.

Prevent this from happening by setting IRQD_HANDLE_ENFORCE_IRQCTX on all
GIC IRQs. Technically per-cpu IRQs do not need this, as their flow handlers
never set IRQS_PENDING, but this aligns all IRQs wrt context enforcement:
this also forces all GIC IRQ handling to happen in IRQ context (as defined
by in_irq()).
