x86/debug: Change thread.debugreg6 to thread.virtual_dr6

Current usage of thread.debugreg6 is convoluted at best. It starts life as
a copy of the hardware DR6 value, but then various bits are cleared and
set.

Replace this with a new variable thread.virtual_dr6 that is initialized to
0 when DR6 is read and only gains bits, at the same time the actual (on
stack) dr6 value which is read from the hardware only gets bits cleared.
