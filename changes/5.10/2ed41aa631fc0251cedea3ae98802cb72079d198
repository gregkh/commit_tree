KVM: VMX: Intercept guest reserved CR4 bits to inject #GP fault

Intercept CR4 bits that are guest reserved so that KVM correctly injects
a #GP fault if the guest attempts to set a reserved bit.  If a feature
is supported by the CPU but is not exposed to the guest, and its
associated CR4 bit is not intercepted by KVM by default, then KVM will
fail to inject a #GP if the guest sets the CR4 bit without triggering
an exit, e.g. by toggling only the bit in question.

Note, KVM doesn't give the guest direct access to any CR4 bits that are
also dependent on guest CPUID.  Yet.
