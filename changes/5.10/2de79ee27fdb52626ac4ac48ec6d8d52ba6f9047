net: try to avoid unneeded backlog flush

flush_all_backlogs() may cause deadlock on systems
running processes with FIFO scheduling policy.

The above is critical in -RT scenarios, where user-space
specifically ensure no network activity is scheduled on
the CPU running the mentioned FIFO process, but still get
stuck.

This commit tries to address the problem checking the
backlog status on the remote CPUs before scheduling the
flush operation. If the backlog is empty, we can skip it.

v1 -> v2:
 - explicitly clear flushed cpu mask - Eric
