can: ti_hecc: convert to devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname()

Use the function devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname() to simplify
source code which calls the functions platform_get_resource_byname()
and devm_ioremap_resource(). Remove also a few error messages which
became unnecessary with this software refactoring.
