scsi: fnic: Do not call 'scsi_done()' for unhandled commands

The fnic drivers assigns an ioreq structure to each command and severs this
assignment once scsi_done() has been called and the command has been
completed.

When traversing commands to terminate outstanding I/O we should not call
scsi_done() on commands which do not have a corresponding ioreq structure;
these commands have either never entered the driver or have already been
completed.
