io_uring: base SQPOLL handling off io_sq_data

Remove the SQPOLL thread from the ctx, and use the io_sq_data as the
data structure we pass in. io_sq_data has a list of ctx's that we can
then iterate over and handle.

As of now we're ready to handle multiple ctx's, though we're still just
handling a single one after this patch.
