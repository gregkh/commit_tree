bcache: remove 'int n' from parameter list of bch_bucket_alloc_set()

The parameter 'int n' from bch_bucket_alloc_set() is not cleared
defined. From the code comments n is the number of buckets to alloc, but
from the code itself 'n' is the maximum cache to iterate. Indeed all the
locations where bch_bucket_alloc_set() is called, 'n' is alwasy 1.

This patch removes the confused and unnecessary 'int n' from parameter
list of  bch_bucket_alloc_set(), and explicitly allocates only 1 bucket
for its caller.
