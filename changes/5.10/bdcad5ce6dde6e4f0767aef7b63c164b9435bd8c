media: tegra-video: Add support for selection ioctl ops

This patch adds selection v4l2 ioctl operations to allow configuring
a selection rectangle in the sensor through the Tegra video device
node.

Some sensor drivers supporting crop uses try_crop rectangle from
v4l2_subdev_pad_config during try format for computing binning.

So with selection ops support, this patch also updates try format
to use try crop rectangle either from subdev frame size enumeration
or from subdev crop boundary.
