leds: ns2: do not guard OF match pointer with of_match_ptr

Do not match OF match pointer with of_match_ptr, so that even if
CONFIG_OF is disabled, the driver can still be bound via another method.

Move definition of of_ns2_leds_match just before ns2_led_driver
definition, since it is not needed sooner.
