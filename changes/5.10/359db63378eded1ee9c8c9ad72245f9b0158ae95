scsi: hisi_sas: Select a suitable queue for internal I/Os

For when managed interrupts are used (and shost->nr_hw_queues is set), a
fixed queue - set per-device - is still used for internal I/Os.

If all the CPUs mapped to that queue are offlined, then the completions for
that queue are not serviced and any internal I/Os will time out.

Fix by selecting a queue for internal I/Os from the queue mapped from the
current CPU in this scenario.

This is still not ideal as it does not deal with CPU hotplug for inflight
internal I/Os, and needs proper support from [0].
