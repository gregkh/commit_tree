block/rnbd-clt: do not cap max_hw_sectors & max_segments with remote device

The max_hw_secotrs is only limited by the transport, not remote device,
block layer on server side will split to the device limit if it's too
big.

The max_segments, similar, and rtrs server will submit single buffer, so
no need to cap.
