bpf: Add btf_struct_ids_match function

Adding btf_struct_ids_match function to check if given address provided
by BTF object + offset is also address of another nested BTF object.

This allows to pass an argument to helper, which is defined via parent
BTF object + offset, like for bpf_d_path (added in following changes):

  SEC("fentry/filp_close")
  int BPF_PROG(prog_close, struct file *file, void *id)
  {
    ...
    ret = bpf_d_path(&file->f_path, ...

The first bpf_d_path argument is hold by verifier as BTF file object
plus offset of f_path member.

The btf_struct_ids_match function will walk the struct file object and
check if there's nested struct path object on the given offset.
