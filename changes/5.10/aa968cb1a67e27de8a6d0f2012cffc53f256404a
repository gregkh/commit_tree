phy: qcom-qmp: Move 'serdes' and 'cfg' into 'struct qcom_phy'

The serdes I/O region is where the PLL for the phy is controlled.
Sometimes the PLL is shared between multiple phys, for example in the
PCIe case where there are three phys inside the same wrapper. Other
times the PLL is for a single phy, i.e. some USB3 phys. To complete the
trifecta we have the USB3+DP combo phy where the USB3 and DP phys each
have their own serdes region because they have their own PLL while they
both share a common I/O region pertaining to the USB type-c pinout and
cable orientation.

Let's move the serdes iomem pointer into 'struct qmp_phy' so that we can
correlate PLL control to the phy that uses it. This allows us to support
the USB3+DP combo phy in this driver. This isn't a problem for the
3-lane/phy PCIe phy because there is a common init function that is the
only place the serdes region is programmed.

Furthermore, move the configuration data that contains most of the
register programming sequences to the qmp phy struct. This data isn't
qmp wrapper specific. It is phy specific data used to tune various
settings for things like pre-emphasis, bias, etc.
