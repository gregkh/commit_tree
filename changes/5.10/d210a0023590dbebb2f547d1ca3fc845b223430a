misc: hisi_hikey_usb: add support for Hikey 970

The HiKey 970 board is similar to Hikey 960 with regards
to its USB configutation: it also relies on a USB HUB
that is used when DWC3 is at host mode.

However, it requires a few extra DT settings, as it
uses a voltage regulator and GPIO reset pin.

Add support for them.
