usb: typec: tcpm: reset hard_reset_count for any disconnect

Current tcpm_detach() only reset hard_reset_count if port->attached
is true, this may cause this counter clear is missed if the CC
disconnect event is generated after tcpm_port_reset() is done
by other events, e.g. VBUS off comes first before CC disconect for
a power sink, in that case the first tcpm_detach() will only clear
port->attached flag but leave hard_reset_count there because
tcpm_port_is_disconnected() is still false, then later tcpm_detach()
by CC disconnect will directly return due to port->attached is cleared,
finally this will result tcpm will not try hard reset or error recovery
for later attach.

ChiYuan reported this issue on his platform with below tcpm trace:
After power sink session setup after hard reset 2 times, detach
from the power source and then attach:

this patch fix this issue by clear hard_reset_count at any cases
of cc disconnect, Ã­.e. don't check port->attached flag.
