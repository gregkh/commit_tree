firmware: smccc: Export both smccc functions

We need to export both arm_smccc_1_1_get_conduit and arm_smccc_get_version
to allow several modules make use of them. Arm FFA, Arm SCMI and PTP
drivers are few drivers that are planning to use these functions.

Let us export them in preparation to add support for SCMI as module.
