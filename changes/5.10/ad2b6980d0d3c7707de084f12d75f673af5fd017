nitro_enclaves: Handle PCI device command requests

The Nitro Enclaves PCI device exposes a MMIO space that this driver
uses to submit command requests and to receive command replies e.g. for
enclave creation / termination or setting enclave resources.

Add logic for handling PCI device command requests based on the given
command type.

Register an MSI-X interrupt vector for command reply notifications to
handle this type of communication events.
