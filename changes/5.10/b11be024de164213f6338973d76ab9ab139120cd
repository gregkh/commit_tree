lockdep: Demagic the return value of BFS

__bfs() could return four magic numbers:

	1: search succeeds, but none match.
	0: search succeeds, find one match.
	-1: search fails because of the cq is full.
	-2: search fails because a invalid node is found.

This patch cleans things up by using a enum type for the return value
of __bfs() and its friends, this improves the code readability of the
code, and further, could help if we want to extend the BFS.
