mm: kmem: enable kernel memcg accounting from interrupt contexts

If a memcg to charge can be determined (using remote charging API), there
are no reasons to exclude allocations made from an interrupt context from
the accounting.

Such allocations will pass even if the resulting memcg size will exceed
the hard limit, but it will affect the application of the memory pressure
and an inability to put the workload under the limit will eventually
trigger the OOM.

To use active_memcg() helper, memcg_kmem_bypass() is moved back to
memcontrol.c.
