x86/cpu: Add hardware-enforced cache coherency as a CPUID feature

In some hardware implementations, coherency between the encrypted and
unencrypted mappings of the same physical page is enforced. In such a system,
it is not required for software to flush the page from all CPU caches in the
system prior to changing the value of the C-bit for a page. This hardware-
enforced cache coherency is indicated by EAX[10] in CPUID leaf 0x8000001f.
