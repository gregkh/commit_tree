arm64: Add workaround for Arm Cortex-A77 erratum 1508412

On Cortex-A77 r0p0 and r1p0, a sequence of a non-cacheable or device load
and a store exclusive or PAR_EL1 read can cause a deadlock.

The workaround requires a DMB SY before and after a PAR_EL1 register
read. In addition, it's possible an interrupt (doing a device read) or
KVM guest exit could be taken between the DMB and PAR read, so we
also need a DMB before returning from interrupt and before returning to
a guest.

A deadlock is still possible with the workaround as KVM guests must also
have the workaround. IOW, a malicious guest can deadlock an affected
systems.

This workaround also depends on a firmware counterpart to enable the h/w
to insert DMB SY after load and store exclusive instructions. See the
errata document SDEN-1152370 v10 [1] for more information.
