nvme-tcp: avoid race between time out and tear down

Now use teardown_lock to serialize for time out and tear down. This may
cause abnormal: first cancel all request in tear down, then time out may
complete the request again, but the request may already be freed or
restarted.

To avoid race between time out and tear down, in tear down process,
first we quiesce the queue, and then delete the timer and cancel
the time out work for the queue. At the same time we need to delete
teardown_lock.
