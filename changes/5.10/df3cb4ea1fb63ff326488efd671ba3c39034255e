sched/fair: Fix wrong cpu selecting from isolated domain

We've met problems that occasionally tasks with full cpumask
(e.g. by putting it into a cpuset or setting to full affinity)
were migrated to our isolated cpus in production environment.

After some analysis, we found that it is due to the current
select_idle_smt() not considering the sched_domain mask.

Steps to reproduce on my 31-CPU hyperthreads machine:
1. with boot parameter: "isolcpus=domain,2-31"
   (thread lists: 0,16 and 1,17)
2. cgcreate -g cpu:test; cgexec -g cpu:test "test_threads"
3. some threads will be migrated to the isolated cpu16~17.

Fix it by checking the valid domain mask in select_idle_smt().
