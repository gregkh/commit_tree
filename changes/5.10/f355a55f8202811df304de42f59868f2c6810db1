net: pcs-xpcs: depend on MDIO_BUS instead of selecting it

The below compile time error can be seen when PHYLIB is configured as a
module.

PHYLIB being a module leads to MDIO_BUS being a module as well while the
XPCS is still built-in. What should happen in this configuration is that
PCS_XPCS should be forced to build as module. However, that select only
acts in the opposite way so we should turn it into a depends.

Fix this up by explicitly depending on MDIO_BUS.
