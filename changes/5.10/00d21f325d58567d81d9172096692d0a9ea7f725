media: Revert "media: exynos4-is: Add missed check for pinctrl_lookup_state()"

The "idle" pinctrl state is optional as documented in the DT binding.
The change introduced by the commit being reverted makes that pinctrl state
mandatory and breaks initialization of the whole media driver, since the
"idle" state is not specified in any mainline dts.

This reverts commit 18ffec750578 ("media: exynos4-is: Add missed check for pinctrl_lookup_state()")
to fix the regression.
