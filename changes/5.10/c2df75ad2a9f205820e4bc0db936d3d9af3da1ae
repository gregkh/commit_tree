drm/panfrost: increase readl_relaxed_poll_timeout values

Amlogic SoC devices report the following errors frequently causing excessive
dmesg log spam and early log rotataion, although the errors appear to be
harmless as everything works fine:

[    7.202702] panfrost ffe40000.gpu: error powering up gpu L2
[    7.203760] panfrost ffe40000.gpu: error powering up gpu shader

ARM staff have advised increasing the timeout values to eliminate the errors
in most normal scenarios, and testing with several different G31/G52 devices
shows 20000 to be a reliable value.
