tracing: Fix userstacktrace option for instances

When the instances were able to use their own options, the userstacktrace
option was left hardcoded for the top level. This made the instance
userstacktrace option bascially into a nop, and will confuse users that set
it, but nothing happens (I was confused when it happened to me!)
