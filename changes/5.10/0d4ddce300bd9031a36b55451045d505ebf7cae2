bpf, x64: use %rcx instead of %rax for tail call retpolines

Currently, %rax is used to store the jump target when BPF program is
emitting the retpoline instructions that are handling the indirect
tailcall.

There is a plan to use %rax for different purpose, which is storing the
tail call counter. In order to preserve this value across the tailcalls,
adjust the BPF indirect tailcalls so that the target program will reside
in %rcx and teach the retpoline instructions about new location of jump
target.
