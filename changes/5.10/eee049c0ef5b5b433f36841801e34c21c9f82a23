l2tp: remove tunnel and session debug flags field

The l2tp subsystem now uses standard kernel logging APIs for
informational and warning messages, and tracepoints for debug
information.

Now that the tunnel and session debug flags are unused, remove the field
from the core structures.

Various system calls (in the case of l2tp_ppp) and netlink messages
handle the getting and setting of debug flags.  To avoid userspace
breakage don't modify the API of these calls; simply ignore set
requests, and send dummy data for get requests.
