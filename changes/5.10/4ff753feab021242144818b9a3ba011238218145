powerpc/pseries: Avoid using addr_to_pfn in real mode

When an UE or memory error exception is encountered the MCE handler
tries to find the pfn using addr_to_pfn() which takes effective
address as an argument, later pfn is used to poison the page where
memory error occurred, recent rework in this area made addr_to_pfn
to run in real mode, which can be fatal as it may try to access
memory outside RMO region.

Have two helper functions to separate things to be done in real mode
and virtual mode without changing any functionality. This also fixes
the following error as the use of addr_to_pfn is now moved to virtual
mode.

Without this change following kernel crash is seen on hitting UE.
