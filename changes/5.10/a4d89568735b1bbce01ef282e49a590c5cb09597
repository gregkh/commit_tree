drm/vc4: crtc: Remove mode_set_nofb

On BCM2711 to avoid stale pixels getting stuck in intermediate FIFOs, the
pixelvalve needs to be setup each time there's a mode change or enable /
disable sequence.

Therefore, we can't really use mode_set_nofb anymore to configure it, but
we need to move it to atomic_enable.
