net: bridge: mdb: add support to extend add/del commands

Since the MDB add/del code expects an exact struct br_mdb_entry we can't
really add any extensions, thus add a new nested attribute at the level of
MDBA_SET_ENTRY called MDBA_SET_ENTRY_ATTRS which will be used to pass
all new options via netlink attributes. This patch doesn't change
anything functionally since the new attribute is not used yet, only
parsed.
