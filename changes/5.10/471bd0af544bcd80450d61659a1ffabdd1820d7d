sd: use bdev_check_media_change

Switch to use bdev_check_media_change instead of check_disk_change and
call sd_revalidate_disk manually.  As sd also calls sd_revalidate_disk
manually during probe and open, the extra call into ->revalidate_disk
from bdev_disk_changed is not required either, so stop wiring up the
method.
