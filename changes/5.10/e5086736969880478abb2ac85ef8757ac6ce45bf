genetlink: reorg struct genl_family

There are holes and oversized members in struct genl_family.

Before: /* size: 104, cachelines: 2, members: 16 */
After:  /* size:  88, cachelines: 2, members: 16 */

The command field in struct genlmsghdr is a u8, so no point
in the operation count being 32 bit. Also operation 0 is
usually undefined, so we only need 255 entries.

netnsok and parallel_ops are only ever initialized to true.

We can grow the fields as needed, compiler should warn us
if someone tries to assign larger constants.
