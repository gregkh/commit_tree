init: main: add KUnit to kernel init

Although we have not seen any actual examples where KUnit doesn't work
because it runs in the late init phase of the kernel, it has been a
concern for some time that this could potentially be an issue in the
future. So, remove KUnit from init calls entirely, instead call directly
from kernel_init() so that KUnit runs after late init.
