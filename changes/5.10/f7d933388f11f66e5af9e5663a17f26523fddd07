arm64: dts: meson: odroid-n2 plus: fix vddcpu_a pwm

On the odroid N2 plus, cpufreq is not available due to an error on the cpu
regulators. vddcpu a and b get the same PWM. The one provided to vddcpu A
is incorrect. Because vddcpu B PWM is busy the regulator cannot register:

> pwm-regulator regulator-vddcpu-b: Failed to get PWM: -16

Like on the odroid n2, use PWM A out of GPIOE_2 for vddcpu A to fix the
problem
