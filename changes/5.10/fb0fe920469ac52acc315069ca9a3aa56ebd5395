drm/amd/display: TMDS Fallback transition

[Why]
HDMI requires fallback to TMDS by redetection
in order to switch PHY settings.
This avoids black out when link training fail
during mode setting, link quality update,
disable driver sequence.

[How]
Allow driver to redetect HDMI displays
based on retraining or fallback mechanism.
