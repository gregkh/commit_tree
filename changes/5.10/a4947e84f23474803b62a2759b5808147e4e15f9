overflow: Include header file with SIZE_MAX declaration

The various array_size functions use SIZE_MAX define, but missed limits.h
causes to failure to compile code that needs overflow.h.

 In file included from drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_std_types_device.c:6:
 ./include/linux/overflow.h: In function 'array_size':
 ./include/linux/overflow.h:258:10: error: 'SIZE_MAX' undeclared (first use in this function)
   258 |   return SIZE_MAX;
       |          ^~~~~~~~

Fixes: 610b15c50e86 ("overflow.h: Add allocation size calculation helpers")
