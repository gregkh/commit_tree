staging: dpaa2-switch: add a dpaa2_switch_ prefix to all functions in ethsw-ethtool.c

Some static functions in the dpaa2-switch driver don't have a distinct
prefix and this is becoming an inconvenience when looking at, for
example, a perf top output and trying to determine easily which entries
are dpaa2 switch related. Ammend this by adding the prefix to all the
functions.
