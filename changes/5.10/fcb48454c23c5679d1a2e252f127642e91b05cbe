selftests/powerpc: rfi_flush: disable entry flush if present

We are about to add an entry flush. The rfi (exit) flush test measures
the number of L1D flushes over a syscall with the RFI flush enabled and
disabled. But if the entry flush is also enabled, the effect of enabling
and disabling the RFI flush is masked.

If there is a debugfs entry for the entry flush, disable it during the RFI
flush and restore it later.
