media: Implements support for the MyGica iGrabber

This small change adds the device identifier for the MyGica iGrabber,
which features an Empia EM2860, a Philips SAA7113, Empia EMP202, and
no tuner. Verified that both the composite and S-Video inputs work
with NTSC source. It does not appear to need any port twiddling on
pre-init.
