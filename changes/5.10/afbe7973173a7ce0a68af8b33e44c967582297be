tracepoints: Add helper to test if tracepoint is enabled in a header

As tracepoints are discouraged from being added in a header because it can
cause side effects if other tracepoints are in headers, as well as bloat the
kernel as the trace_<tracepoint>() function is not a small inline, the common
workaround is to add a function call that calls a wrapper function in a
C file that then calls the tracepoint. But as function calls add overhead,
this function should only be called when the tracepoint in question is
enabled. To get around this overhead, a static_branch can be used to only
have the tracepoint wrapper get called when the tracepoint is enabled.

Add a tracepoint_enabled(tp) macro that gets passed the name of the
tracepoint, and this becomes a static_branch that is enabled when the
tracepoint is enabled and is a nop when the tracepoint is disabled.
