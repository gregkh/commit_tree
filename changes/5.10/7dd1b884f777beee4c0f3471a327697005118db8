dma-resv: lockdep-prime address_space->i_mmap_rwsem for dma-resv

GPU drivers need this in their shrinkers, to be able to throw out
mmap'ed buffers. Note that we also need dma_resv_lock in shrinkers,
but that loop is resolved by trylocking in shrinkers.

So full hierarchy is now (ignore some of the other branches we already
have primed):

mmap_read_lock -> dma_resv -> shrinkers -> i_mmap_lock_write

I hope that's not inconsistent with anything mm or fs does, adding
relevant people.
