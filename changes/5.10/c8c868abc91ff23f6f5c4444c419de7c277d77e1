fscrypt: make fscrypt_set_test_dummy_encryption() take a 'const char *'

fscrypt_set_test_dummy_encryption() requires that the optional argument
to the test_dummy_encryption mount option be specified as a substring_t.
That doesn't work well with filesystems that use the new mount API,
since the new way of parsing mount options doesn't use substring_t.

Make it take the argument as a 'const char *' instead.

Instead of moving the match_strdup() into the callers in ext4 and f2fs,
make them just use arg->from directly.  Since the pattern is
"test_dummy_encryption=%s", the argument will be null-terminated.
