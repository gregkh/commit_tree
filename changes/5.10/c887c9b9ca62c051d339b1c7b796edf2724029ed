kvm: mmu: fix is_tdp_mmu_check when the TDP MMU is not in use

In some cases where shadow paging is in use, the root page will
be either mmu->pae_root or vcpu->arch.mmu->lm_root.  Then it will
not have an associated struct kvm_mmu_page, because it is allocated
with alloc_page instead of kvm_mmu_alloc_page.

Just return false quickly from is_tdp_mmu_root if the TDP MMU is
not in use, which also includes the case where shadow paging is
enabled.
