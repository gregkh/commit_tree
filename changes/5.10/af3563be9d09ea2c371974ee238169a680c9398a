net: usb: kaweth: Replace kaweth_control() with usb_control_msg()

kaweth_control() is almost the same as usb_control_msg() except for the
memory allocation mode (GFP_ATOMIC vs GFP_NOIO) and the in_interrupt()
check.

All the invocations of kaweth_control() are within the probe function in
fully preemtible context so there is no reason to use atomic allocations,
GFP_NOIO which is used by usb_control_msg() is perfectly fine.

Replace kaweth_control() invocations from probe with usb_control_msg().
