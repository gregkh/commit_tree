USB: core: Fix regression in Hercules audio card

Commit 3e4f8e21c4f2 ("USB: core: fix check for duplicate endpoints")
aimed to make the USB stack more reliable by detecting and skipping
over endpoints that are duplicated between interfaces.  This caused a
regression for a Hercules audio card (reported as Bugzilla #208357),
which contains such non-compliant duplications.  Although the
duplications are harmless, skipping the valid endpoints prevented the
device from working.

This patch fixes the regression by adding ENDPOINT_IGNORE quirks for
the Hercules card, telling the kernel to ignore the invalid duplicate
endpoints and thereby allowing the valid endpoints to be used as
intended.
