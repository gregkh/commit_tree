platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Map Clipping tool hotkey to KEY_SELECTIVE_SCREENSHOT

Commit 696c6523ec8f ("platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: add mapping for new
hotkeys") added support for a bunch of new hotkeys, but the
clipping/snipping tool hotkey got ignored because there was no good
key-code to map it to.

Recently a new KEY_SELECTIVE_SCREENSHOT keycode was added by commit
3b059da9835c ("Input: allocate keycode for "Selective Screenshot" key")
quoting from the commit message:

"New Chrome OS keyboards have a "snip" key that is basically a selective
screenshot (allows a user to select an area of screen to be copied).
Allocate a keycode for it."

Support for this "snip" key seems like it is also a good match for the
clipping/snipping tool hotkey, so map this hotkey to the new
KEY_SELECTIVE_SCREENSHOT key-code.
