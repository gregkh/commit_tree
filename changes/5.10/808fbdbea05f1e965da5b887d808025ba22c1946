mm/mmap: not necessary to check mapping separately

*root* with type of struct rb_root_cached is an element of *mapping*
with type of struct address_space. This implies when we have a valid
*root* it must be a part of valid *mapping*.

So we can merge these two checks together to make the code more easy to
read and to save some cpu cycles.
