docs: submitting-patches: describe preserving review/test tags

From time to time, the novice kernel contributors do not add Reviewed-by
or Tested-by tags to the next versions of the patches.  Mostly because
they are unaware that responsibility of adding these tags in next
version is on submitter, not maintainer.
