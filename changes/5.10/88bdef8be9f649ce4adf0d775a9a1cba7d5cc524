net: dsa: mt7530: Extend device data ready for adding a new hardware

Add a structure holding required operations for each device such as device
initialization, PHY port read or write, a checker whether PHY interface is
supported on a certain port, MAC port setup for either bus pad or a
specific PHY interface.

The patch is done for ready adding a new hardware MT7531, and keep the
same setup logic of existing hardware.
