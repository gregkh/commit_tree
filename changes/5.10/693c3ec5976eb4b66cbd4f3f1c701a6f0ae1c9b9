drm/i915/dp: Extract drm_dp_read_sink_count_cap()

Since other drivers are also going to need to be aware of the sink count
in order to do proper dongle detection, we might as well steal i915's
DP_SINK_COUNT helpers and move them into DRM helpers so that other
dirvers can use them as well.

Note that this also starts using intel_dp_has_sink_count() in
intel_dp_detect_dpcd(), which is a functional change.

v5:
* Change name from drm_dp_has_sink_count() to
  drm_dp_read_sink_count_cap()
