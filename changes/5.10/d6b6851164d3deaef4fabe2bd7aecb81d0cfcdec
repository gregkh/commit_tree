media: tegra-video: Fix channel format alignment

Pixel format width is mistakenly aligned to surface align bytes
and altering width to aligned value may force sensor mode change
other than the requested one and also cause mismatch in width
programmed between sensor and vi which can lead to capture errors.

This patch removes width alignment and clamps width as per Tegra
minimum and maximum limits.
