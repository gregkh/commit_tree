usb: ohci-omap: Fix descriptor conversion

There were a bunch of issues with the patch converting the
OMAP1 OSK board to use descriptors for controlling the USB
host:

- The chip label was incorrect
- The GPIO offset was off-by-one
- The code should use sleeping accessors

This patch tries to fix all issues at the same time.
