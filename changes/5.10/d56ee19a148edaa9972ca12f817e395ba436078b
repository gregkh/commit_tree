mwifiex: wmm: Fix -Wunused-const-variable warnings

In file included from drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex//cmdevt.c:26:0:
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex//wmm.h:41:17: warning: ‘tos_to_tid_inv’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
 static const u8 tos_to_tid_inv[] = {
                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex//wmm.h:34:18: warning: ‘mwifiex_1d_to_wmm_queue’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
 static const u16 mwifiex_1d_to_wmm_queue[8] = { 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 };
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

move the variables definition to .c file, and leave declarations
in the header file to fix these warnings.
