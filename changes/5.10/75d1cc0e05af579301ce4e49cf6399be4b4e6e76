x86/mm/pat: Don't flush cache if hardware enforces cache coherency across encryption domnains

In some hardware implementations, coherency between the encrypted and
unencrypted mappings of the same physical page is enforced. In such a
system, it is not required for software to flush the page from all CPU
caches in the system prior to changing the value of the C-bit for the
page. So check that bit before flushing the cache.
