userfaultfd: selftests: fix SIGSEGV if huge mmap fails

The error handling in hugetlb_allocate_area() was incorrect for the
hugetlb_shared test case.

Previously the behavior was:

- mmap a hugetlb area
  - If this fails, set the pointer to NULL, and carry on
- mmap an alias of the same hugetlb fd
  - If this fails, munmap the original area

If the original mmap failed, it's likely the second one did too.  If
both failed, we'd blindly try to munmap a NULL pointer, causing a
SIGSEGV.  Instead, "goto fail" so we return before trying to mmap the
alias.

This issue can be hit "in real life" by forgetting to set
/proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages (leaving it at 0), and then trying to run the
hugetlb_shared test.

Another small improvement is, when the original mmap fails, don't just
print "it failed": perror(), so we can see *why*.  :)
