regulator: don't require mutex for regulator_notifier_call_chain()

Since 3801b86aa482 ("regulator: Refactor supply implementation
to work as regular consumers") we no longer cascade notifications
and so notifier head's built-in rwsem is enough to protect the
notifier chain. Remove the requirement to fix one case where
rdev->mutex might be forced to be taken recursively.
