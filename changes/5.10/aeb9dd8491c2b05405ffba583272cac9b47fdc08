dt-bindings: arm: hisilicon: convert hisilicon,hip04-bootwrapper bindings to json-schema

Convert the Hisilicon Bootwrapper boot method binding to DT schema format
using json-schema.

The property boot-method contains two groups of physical address range
information: bootwrapper and relocation. The "uint32-array" type is not
suitable for it, because the field "address" and "size" may occupy one or
two cells respectively. Use "minItems: 1" and "maxItems: 2" to allow it
can be written in "<addr size addr size>" or "<addr size>, <addr size>"
format.
