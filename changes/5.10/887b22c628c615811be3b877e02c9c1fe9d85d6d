mm/filemap: fix page cache removal for arbitrary sized THPs

Patch series "Remove assumptions of THP size".

There are a number of places in the VM which assume that a THP is a PMD in
size.  That's true today, and remains true after this patch series, but
this is a prerequisite for switching to arbitrary-sized THPs.
thp_nr_pages() still returns either HPAGE_PMD_NR or 1, but will be changed
later.

This patch (of 11):

page_cache_free_page() assumes THPs are PMD_SIZE; fix that assumption.
