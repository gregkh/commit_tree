libbpf: Centralize poisoning and poison reallocarray()

Most of libbpf source files already include libbpf_internal.h, so it's a good
place to centralize identifier poisoning. So move kernel integer type
poisoning there. And also add reallocarray to a poison list to prevent
accidental use of it. libbpf_reallocarray() should be used universally
instead.
