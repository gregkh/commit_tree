mmc: sdhci-of-sparx5: Use proper printk format for dma_addr_t

dma_addr_t size varies between architectures so use dedicated printk
format to fix compile testing warning (e.g. on 32-bit MIPS):

  drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-of-sparx5.c:63:11: warning:
    format ‘%llx’ expects argument of type ‘long long unsigned int’, but argument 5 has type ‘dma_addr_t {aka unsigned int}’ [-Wformat=]
