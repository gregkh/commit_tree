media: uapi: h264: Split prediction weight parameters

The prediction weight parameters are only required under
certain conditions, which depend on slice header parameters.

As specified in section 7.3.3 Slice header syntax, the prediction
weight table is present if:

((weighted_pred_flag && (slice_type == P || slice_type == SP)) || \
(weighted_bipred_idc == 1 && slice_type == B))

Given its size, it makes sense to move this table to its control,
so applications can avoid passing it if the slice doesn't specify it.

Before this change struct v4l2_ctrl_h264_slice_params was 960 bytes.
With this change, it's 188 bytes and struct v4l2_ctrl_h264_pred_weight
is 772 bytes.
