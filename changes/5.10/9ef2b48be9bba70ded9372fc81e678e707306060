KVM: arm64: Allow patching EL2 vectors even with KASLR is not enabled

Patching the EL2 exception vectors is integral to the Spectre-v2
workaround, where it can be necessary to execute CPU-specific sequences
to nobble the branch predictor before running the hypervisor text proper.

Remove the dependency on CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE and allow the EL2 vectors
to be patched even when KASLR is not enabled.
