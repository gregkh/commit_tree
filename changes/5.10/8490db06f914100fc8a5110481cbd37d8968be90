tracing/boot: Add per-instance tracing_on option support

Add per-instance tracing_on option, which will be useful with
traceon/traceoff event trigger actions. For example, if we
disable tracing_on by default and set traceon and traceoff on
a pair of events, we can trace functions between the pair of
events.
