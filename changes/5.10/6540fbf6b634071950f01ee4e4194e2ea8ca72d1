block: don't clear bd_invalidated in check_disk_size_change

bd_invalidated is set by check_disk_change or in add_disk to initiate a
partition scan.  Move it from check_disk_size_change which is called
from both revalidate_disk() and bdev_disk_changed() to only the latter,
as that is what is called from the block device open code (and nbd) to
deal with the bd_invalidated event.  revalidate_disk() on the other hand
is mostly used to propagate a size update from the gendisk to the block
device, which is entirely unrelated.
