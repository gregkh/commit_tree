drm/i915: Hold onto an explicit ref to i915_vma_work.pinned

Since __vma_release is run by a kworker after the fence has been
signaled, it is no longer protected by the active reference on the vma,
and so the alias of vw->pinned to vma->obj is also not protected by a
reference on the object. Add an explicit reference for vw->pinned so it
will always be safe.

Found by inspection.
