x86/hyperv: Remove aliases with X64 in their name

In the architecture independent version of hyperv-tlfs.h, commit c55a844f46f958b
removed the "X64" in the symbol names so they would make sense for both x86 and
ARM64.  That commit added aliases with the "X64" in the x86 version of hyperv-tlfs.h 
so that existing x86 code would continue to compile.

As a cleanup, update the x86 code to use the symbols without the "X64", then remove 
the aliases.  There's no functional change.
