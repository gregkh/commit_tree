selinux: move policy mutex to selinux_state, use in lockdep checks

Move the mutex used to synchronize policy changes (reloads and setting
of booleans) from selinux_fs_info to selinux_state and use it in
lockdep checks for rcu_dereference_protected() calls in the security
server functions.  This makes the dependency on the mutex explicit
in the code rather than relying on comments.
