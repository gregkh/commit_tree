mm: Allow arm64 mmap(PROT_MTE) on RAM-based files

Since arm64 memory (allocation) tags can only be stored in RAM, mapping
files with PROT_MTE is not allowed by default. RAM-based files like
those in a tmpfs mount or memfd_create() can support memory tagging, so
update the vm_flags accordingly in shmem_mmap().
