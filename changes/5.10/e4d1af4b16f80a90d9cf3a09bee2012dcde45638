selftests/bpf: Add test for d_path helper

Adding test for d_path helper which is pretty much
copied from Wenbo Zhang's test for bpf_get_fd_path,
which never made it in.

The test is doing fstat/close on several fd types,
and verifies we got the d_path helper working on
kernel probes for vfs_getattr/filp_close functions.
