xsk: Move queue_id, dev and need_wakeup to buffer pool

Move queue_id, dev, and need_wakeup from the umem to the
buffer pool. This so that we in a later commit can share the umem
between multiple HW queues. There is one buffer pool per dev and
queue id, so these variables should belong to the buffer pool, not
the umem. Need_wakeup is also something that is set on a per napi
level, so there is usually one per device and queue id. So move
this to the buffer pool too.
