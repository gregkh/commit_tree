sched/fair: Tweak pick_next_entity()

Currently, pick_next_entity(...) has the following structure
(simplified):

  [...]
  if (last_buddy_ok())
    result = last_buddy;
  if (next_buddy_ok())
    result = next_buddy;
  [...]

The intended behavior is to prefer next buddy over last buddy;
the current code somewhat obfuscates this, and also wastes
cycles checking the last buddy when eventually the next buddy is
picked up.

So this patch refactors two 'ifs' above into

  [...]
  if (next_buddy_ok())
      result = next_buddy;
  else if (last_buddy_ok())
      result = last_buddy;
  [...]
