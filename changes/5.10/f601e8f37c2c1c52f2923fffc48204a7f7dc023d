Revert "driver core: Annotate dev_err_probe() with __must_check"

This reverts commit e1f82a0dcf388d98bcc7ad195c03bd812405e6b2 as it's
already starting to cause build warnings in linux-next for things that
are "obviously correct".

It's up to driver authors do "do the right thing" here with this
function, and if they don't want to call it as the last line of a
function, that's up to them, otherwise code that looks like:
	ret = dev_err_probe(..., ret, ...);
does look really "odd".
