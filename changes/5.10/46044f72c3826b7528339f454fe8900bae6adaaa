kvm: x86/mmu: Support write protection for nesting in tdp MMU

To support nested virtualization, KVM will sometimes need to write
protect pages which are part of a shadowed paging structure or are not
writable in the shadowed paging structure. Add a function to write
protect GFN mappings for this purpose.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.
