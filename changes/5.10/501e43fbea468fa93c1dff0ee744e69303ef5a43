fscrypt: rename DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME to DCACHE_NOKEY_NAME

Originally we used the term "encrypted name" or "ciphertext name" to
mean the encoded filename that is shown when an encrypted directory is
listed without its key.  But these terms are ambiguous since they also
mean the filename stored on-disk.  "Encrypted name" is especially
ambiguous since it could also be understood to mean "this filename is
encrypted on-disk", similar to "encrypted file".

So we've started calling these encoded names "no-key names" instead.

Therefore, rename DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME to DCACHE_NOKEY_NAME to avoid
confusion about what this flag means.
