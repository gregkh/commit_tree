PCI/ASPM: Remove struct aspm_register_info.l1ss_cap

Previously we stored the L1SS Capabilities value in the struct
aspm_register_info.

We only need this information in one place, so read it there and remove
struct aspm_register_info completely, since it's now empty.  No functional
change intended.
