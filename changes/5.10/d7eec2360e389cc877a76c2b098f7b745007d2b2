KVM: arm64: Add PMU event filtering infrastructure

It can be desirable to expose a PMU to a guest, and yet not want the
guest to be able to count some of the implemented events (because this
would give information on shared resources, for example.

For this, let's extend the PMUv3 device API, and offer a way to setup a
bitmap of the allowed events (the default being no bitmap, and thus no
filtering).

Userspace can thus allow/deny ranges of event. The default policy
depends on the "polarity" of the first filter setup (default deny if the
filter allows events, and default allow if the filter denies events).
This allows to setup exactly what is allowed for a given guest.

Note that although the ioctl is per-vcpu, the map of allowed events is
global to the VM (it can be setup from any vcpu until the vcpu PMU is
initialized).
