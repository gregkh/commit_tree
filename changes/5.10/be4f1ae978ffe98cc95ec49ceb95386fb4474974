mm: kasan: do not panic if both panic_on_warn and kasan_multishot set

KASAN errors will currently trigger a panic when panic_on_warn is set.
This renders kasan_multishot useless, as further KASAN errors won't be
reported if the kernel has already paniced.  By making kasan_multishot
disable this behaviour for KASAN errors, we can still have the benefits of
panic_on_warn for non-KASAN warnings, yet be able to use kasan_multishot.

This is particularly important when running KASAN tests, which need to
trigger multiple KASAN errors: previously these would panic the system if
panic_on_warn was set, now they can run (and will panic the system should
non-KASAN warnings show up).
