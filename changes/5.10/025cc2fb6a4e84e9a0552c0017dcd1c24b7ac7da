net/tls: Protect from calling tls_dev_del for TLS RX twice

tls_device_offload_cleanup_rx doesn't clear tls_ctx->netdev after
calling tls_dev_del if TLX TX offload is also enabled. Clearing
tls_ctx->netdev gets postponed until tls_device_gc_task. It leaves a
time frame when tls_device_down may get called and call tls_dev_del for
RX one extra time, confusing the driver, which may lead to a crash.

This patch corrects this racy behavior by adding a flag to prevent
tls_device_down from calling tls_dev_del the second time.
