selftests/mptcp: Better delay & reordering configuration

The delay was intended to be configured to "simulate" a high(er) BDP
link. As such, it needs to be set as part of the loss-configuration and
not as part of the netem reordering configuration.

The reordering-config also requires a delay but that delay is the
reordering-extend. So, a good approach is to set the reordering-extend
as a function of the configured latency. E.g., 25% of the overall
latency.

To speed up the selftests, we limit the delay to 50ms maximum to avoid
having the selftests run for too long.

Finally, the intention of tc_reorder was that when it is unset, the test
picks a random configuration. However, currently it is always initialized
and thus the random config won't be picked up.
