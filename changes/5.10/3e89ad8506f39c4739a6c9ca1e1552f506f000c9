checkpatch: add --kconfig-prefix

Kconfig allows to customize the CONFIG_ prefix via the $CONFIG_
environment variable.  Out-of-tree projects may therefore use Kconfig with
a different prefix, or they may use a custom configuration tool which does
not use the CONFIG_ prefix at all.  Such projects may still want to adhere
to the Linux kernel coding style and run checkpatch.pl.

One example is OP-TEE [1] which does not use Kconfig but does have
configuration options prefixed with CFG_.  It also mostly follows the
kernel coding style and therefore being able to use checkpatch is quite
valuable.

To make this possible, add the --kconfig-prefix command line option.
