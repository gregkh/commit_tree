spi: dw: Convert CS-override to DW SPI capabilities

There are several vendor-specific versions of the DW SPI controllers,
each of which may have some peculiarities with respect to the original
IP-core. Seeing it has already caused adding flags and a callback into the
DW SPI private data, let's introduce a generic capabilities interface to
tune the generic DW SPI controller driver up in accordance with the
particular controller specifics. It's done by converting a simple
Alpine-specific CS-override capability into the DW SPI controller
capability activated by setting the DW_SPI_CAP_CS_OVERRIDE flag.
