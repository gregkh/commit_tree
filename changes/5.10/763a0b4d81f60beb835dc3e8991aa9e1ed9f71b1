habanalabs: Fix alignment issue in cpucp_info structure

Because the device CPU compiler aligns structures to 8 bytes,
struct cpucp_info has an alignment issue as some parts
in the structure are not aligned to 8 bytes.
It is preferred that we explicitly insert placeholders inside
the structure to avoid confusion

in order to validate this scenario, we printed both pointers:

__u8 cpucp_version[VERSION_MAX_LEN]; (0xffff899c67ed4cbc)
__le64 dram_size;                    (0xffff899c67ed4d40)

we see difference of 132 bytes although the first array
is only 128 bytes long, Meaning compiler added a 4 byte padding.
