arm64: mte: CPU feature detection and initial sysreg configuration

Add the cpufeature and hwcap entries to detect the presence of MTE. Any
secondary CPU not supporting the feature, if detected on the boot CPU,
will be parked.

Add the minimum SCTLR_EL1 and HCR_EL2 bits for enabling MTE. The Normal
Tagged memory type is configured in MAIR_EL1 before the MMU is enabled
in order to avoid disrupting other CPUs in the CnP domain.
