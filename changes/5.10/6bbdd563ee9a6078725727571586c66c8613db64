dax: Create a range version of dax_layout_busy_page()

virtiofs device has a range of memory which is mapped into file inodes
using dax. This memory is mapped in qemu on host and maps different
sections of real file on host. Size of this memory is limited
(determined by administrator) and depending on filesystem size, we will
soon reach a situation where all the memory is in use and we need to
reclaim some.

As part of reclaim process, we will need to make sure that there are
no active references to pages (taken by get_user_pages()) on the memory
range we are trying to reclaim. I am planning to use
dax_layout_busy_page() for this. But in current form this is per inode
and scans through all the pages of the inode.

We want to reclaim only a portion of memory (say 2MB page). So we want
to make sure that only that 2MB range of pages do not have any
references  (and don't want to unmap all the pages of inode).

Hence, create a range version of this function named
dax_layout_busy_page_range() which can be used to pass a range which
needs to be unmapped.
