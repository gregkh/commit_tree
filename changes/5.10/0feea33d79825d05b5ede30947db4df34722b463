soc: qcom-geni-se: Don't use relaxed writes when writing commands

Writing the command is the final step in kicking off a transfer.
Let's use writel() to ensure that any other memory accesses are done
before the command kicks off.  It's expected that this is mostly
relevant if we're in DMA mode but since it doesn't appear to regress
performance in a measurable way [1] even in PIO mode and it's easier
to reason about then let's just always use it.

NOTE: this patch came about due to code inspection.  No actual
problems were observed that this patch fixes.

[1] Tested by timing "flashrom -p ec" on a Chromebook which stresses
GENI SPI a lot.
