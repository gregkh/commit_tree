selftests: fib_nexthops: Test cleanup of FDB entries following nexthop deletion

Commit c7cdbe2efc40 ("vxlan: support for nexthop notifiers") registered
a listener in the VXLAN driver to the nexthop notification chain. Its
purpose is to cleanup FDB entries that use a nexthop that is being
deleted.

Test that such FDB entries are removed when the nexthop group that they
use is deleted. Test that entries are not deleted when a single nexthop
in the group is deleted.
