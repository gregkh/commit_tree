KVM: x86/mmu: Return unique RET_PF_* values if the fault was fixed

Introduce RET_PF_FIXED and RET_PF_SPURIOUS to provide unique return
values instead of overloading RET_PF_RETRY.  In the short term, the
unique values add clarity to the code and RET_PF_SPURIOUS will be used
by set_spte() to avoid unnecessary work for spurious faults.

In the long term, TDX will use RET_PF_FIXED to deterministically map
memory during pre-boot.  The page fault flow may bail early for benign
reasons, e.g. if the mmu_notifier fires for an unrelated address.  With
only RET_PF_RETRY, it's impossible for the caller to distinguish between
"cool, page is mapped" and "darn, need to try again", and thus cannot
handle benign cases like the mmu_notifier retry.
