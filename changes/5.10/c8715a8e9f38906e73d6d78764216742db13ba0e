ipmr: Add high byte of VIF ID to igmpmsg

Use the unused3 byte in struct igmpmsg to hold the high 8 bits of the
VIF ID.

If using more than 255 IPv4 multicast interfaces it is necessary to have
access to a VIF ID for cache reports that is wider than 8 bits, the VIF
ID present in the igmpmsg reports sent to mroute_sk was only 8 bits wide
in the igmpmsg header.  Adding the high 8 bits of the 16 bit VIF ID in
the unused byte allows use of more than 255 IPv4 multicast interfaces.
