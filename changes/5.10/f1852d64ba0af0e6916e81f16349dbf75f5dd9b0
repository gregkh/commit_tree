net: ena: ethtool: convert stat_offset to 64 bit resolution

The type of all stat fields is u64, therefore when iterating over stat
fields in a stats struct, it makes sense to use an offset in 64 bit
resolution. Doing so allows us to drop some of the casting that is
currently used when referencing stats.
