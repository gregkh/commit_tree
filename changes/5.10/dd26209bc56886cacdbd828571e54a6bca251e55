pinctrl: intel: Fix 2 kOhm bias which is 833 Ohm

2 kOhm bias was never an option in Intel GPIO hardware, the available
matrix is:

	000	none
	001	1 kOhm (if available)
	010	5 kOhm
	100	20 kOhm

As easy to get the 3 resistors are gated separately and according to
parallel circuits calculations we may get combinations of the above where
the result is always strictly less than minimal resistance. Hence,
additional values can be:

	011	~833.3 Ohm
	101	~952.4 Ohm
	110	~4 kOhm
	111	~800 Ohm

That said, convert TERM definitions to be the bit masks to reflect the above.

While at it, enable the same setting for pull down case.
