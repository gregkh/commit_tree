xfrm/compat: Translate by copying XFRMA_UNSPEC attribute

xfrm_xlate32() translates 64-bit message provided by kernel to be sent
for 32-bit listener (acknowledge or monitor). Translator code doesn't
expect XFRMA_UNSPEC attribute as it doesn't know its payload.
Kernel never attaches such attribute, but a user can.

I've searched if any opensource does it and the answer is no.
Nothing on github and google finds only tfcproject that has such code
commented-out.

What will happen if a user sends a netlink message with XFRMA_UNSPEC
attribute? Ipsec code ignores this attribute. But if there is a
monitor-process or 32-bit user requested ack - kernel will try to
translate such message and will hit WARN_ONCE() in xfrm_xlate64_attr().

Deal with XFRMA_UNSPEC by copying the attribute payload with
xfrm_nla_cpy(). In result, the default switch-case in xfrm_xlate64_attr()
becomes an unused code. Leave those 3 lines in case a new xfrm attribute
will be added.
