arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Set default pinctrl for blsp1_uart1/2

Right now some device nodes set default pinctrl within msm8916.dtsi
(e.g. I2C, SPI), but for others it needs to be explicitly set in the
board-specific device tree (e.g. UART).

While it is theoretically possible that some super special board
needs different pinctrl for these, in practice pretty much every
board ends up using the common pinctrl definitions.

Make this consistent by also defining the common pinctrl properties
for blsp1_uart1 and blsp1_uart2 so we don't need to copy this for every
board. If there is really such a super special board it could just
override these properties with custom pinctrl or make minor modifications
to the common pinctrl configurations provided by msm8916-pins.dtsi.

Also move #address-cells/#size-cells for &dsi0 to msm8916.dtsi
since this is specific to the DSI node, not the board.
