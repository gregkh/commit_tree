arm64: cpufeature: reorder cpus_have_{const, final}_cap()

In a subsequent patch we'll modify cpus_have_const_cap() to call
cpus_have_final_cap(), and hence we need to define cpus_have_final_cap()
first.

To make subsequent changes easier to follow, this patch reorders the two
without making any other changes.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
