samples: bpf: Fix broken bpf programs due to removed symbol

>From commit f1394b798814 ("block: mark blk_account_io_completion
static") symbol blk_account_io_completion() has been marked as static,
which makes it no longer possible to attach kprobe to this event.
Currently, there are broken samples due to this reason.

As a solution to this, attach kprobe events to blk_account_io_done()
to modify them to perform the same behavior as before.
