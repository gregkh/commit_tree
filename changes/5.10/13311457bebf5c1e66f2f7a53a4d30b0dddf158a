drm/vc4: hdmi: Move accessors to vc4_hdmi

The current driver only supports a single HDMI controller, and part of
the issue is that the main vc4_dev structure holds a pointer to its
(only) HDMI controller, and the HDMI registers accessors will use it to
retrieve the mapped addresses.

Let's modify those accessors to use directly the vc4_hdmi structure so
that we can eventually get rid of that single global pointer.
