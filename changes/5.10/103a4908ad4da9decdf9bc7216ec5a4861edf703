x86/head/64: Disable stack protection for head$(BITS).o

On 64-bit, the startup_64_setup_env() function added in

  866b556efa12 ("x86/head/64: Install startup GDT")

has stack protection enabled because of set_bringup_idt_handler().
This happens when CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG is enabled. It
also currently needs CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT enabled because then
set_bringup_idt_handler() is not an empty stub but that might change in
the future, when the other vendor adds their similar technology.

At this point, %gs is not yet initialized, and this doesn't cause a
crash only because the #PF handler from the decompressor stub is still
installed and handles the page fault.

Disable stack protection for the whole file, and do it on 32-bit as
well to avoid surprises.
