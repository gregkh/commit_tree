net/smc: determine proposed ISM devices

SMCD Version 2 allows to propose up to 8 additional ISM devices
offered to the peer as candidates for SMCD communication.
This patch covers determination of the ISM devices to be proposed.
ISM devices without PNETID are preferred, since ISM devices with
PNETID are a V1 leftover and will disappear over the time.
