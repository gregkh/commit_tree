nbd: make the config put is called before the notifying the waiter

There has one race case for ceph's rbd-nbd tool. When do mapping
it may fail with EBUSY from ioctl(nbd, NBD_DO_IT), but actually
the nbd device has already unmaped.

It dues to if just after the wake_up(), the recv_work() is scheduled
out and defers calling the nbd_config_put(), though the map process
has exited the "nbd->recv_task" is not cleared.
