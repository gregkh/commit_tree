docs: kernel_abi.py: use --enable-lineno for get_abi.pl

Just like kernel-doc extension, we need to be able to identify
what part of an imported document has issues, as reporting them
as:

	get_abi.pl rest --dir $srctree/Documentation/ABI/obsolete --rst-source:1689: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.

Makes a lot harder for someone to fix.

It should be noticed that it the line which will be reported is
the line where the "What:" definition is, and not the line
with actually has an error.
