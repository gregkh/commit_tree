NFSD: Add missing NFSv2 .pc_func methods

There's no protection in nfsd_dispatch() against a NULL .pc_func
helpers. A malicious NFS client can trigger a crash by invoking the
unused/unsupported NFSv2 ROOT or WRITECACHE procedures.

The current NFSD dispatcher does not support returning a void reply
to a non-NULL procedure, so the reply to both of these is wrong, for
the moment.
