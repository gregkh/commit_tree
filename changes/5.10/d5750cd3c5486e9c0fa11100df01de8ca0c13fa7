kbuild: Disable CONFIG_LD_ORPHAN_WARN for ld.lld 10.0.1

ld.lld 10.0.1 spews a bunch of various warnings about .rela sections,
along with a few others. Newer versions of ld.lld do not have these
warnings. As a result, do not add '--orphan-handling=warn' to
LDFLAGS_vmlinux if ld.lld's version is not new enough.
