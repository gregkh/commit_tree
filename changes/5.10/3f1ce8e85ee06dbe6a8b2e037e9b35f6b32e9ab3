iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Share process page tables

With Shared Virtual Addressing (SVA), we need to mirror CPU TTBR, TCR,
MAIR and ASIDs in SMMU contexts. Each SMMU has a single ASID space split
into two sets, shared and private. Shared ASIDs correspond to those
obtained from the arch ASID allocator, and private ASIDs are used for
"classic" map/unmap DMA.

A possible conflict happens when trying to use a shared ASID that has
already been allocated for private use by the SMMU driver. This will be
addressed in a later patch by replacing the private ASID. At the
moment we return -EBUSY.

Each mm_struct shared with the SMMU will have a single context
descriptor. Add a refcount to keep track of this. It will be protected
by the global SVA lock.

Introduce a new arm-smmu-v3-sva.c file and the CONFIG_ARM_SMMU_V3_SVA
option to let users opt in SVA support.
