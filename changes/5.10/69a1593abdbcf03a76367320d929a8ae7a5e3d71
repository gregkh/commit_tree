powerpc/32s: Setup the early hash table at all time.

At the time being, an early hash table is set up when
CONFIG_KASAN is selected.

There is nothing wrong with setting such an early hash table
all the time, even if it is not used. This is a statically
allocated 256 kB table which lies in the init data section.

This makes the code simpler and may in the future allow to
setup early IO mappings with fixmap instead of hard coding BATs.

Put create_hpte() and flush_hash_pages() in the .ref.text section
in order to avoid warning for the reference to early_hash[]. This
reference is removed by MMU_init_hw_patch() before init memory is
freed.
