drivers: core: fix kernel-doc markup for dev_err_probe()

There are two literal blocks there. Fix the markups, in order
to produce the right html output and solve those warnings:

	./drivers/base/core.c:4218: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
	./drivers/base/core.c:4222: WARNING: Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
	./drivers/base/core.c:4223: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

Fixes: a787e5400a1c ("driver core: add device probe log helper")
