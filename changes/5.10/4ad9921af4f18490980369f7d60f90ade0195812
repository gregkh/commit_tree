printk: finalize records with trailing newlines

Any record with a trailing newline (LOG_NEWLINE flag) cannot
be continued because the newline has been stripped and will
not be visible if the message is appended. This was already
handled correctly when committing in log_output() but was
not handled correctly when committing in log_store().

Fixes: f5f022e53b87 ("printk: reimplement log_cont using record extension")
