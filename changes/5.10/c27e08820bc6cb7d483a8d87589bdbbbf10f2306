HID: hid-debug: fix nonblocking read semantics wrt EIO/ERESTARTSYS

When the file has been open in non-blocking mode, EIO or ERESTARTSYS
would never be returned even if they should (for example when device
has been unplugged, you want EIO and not EAGAIN to be returned).

Move the O_NONBLOCK check after other checks have been performed.

Based on similar to patches hidraw and hiddev by Founder Fang
<founder.fang@gmail.com> and Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>.
