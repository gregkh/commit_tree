ASoC: sun8i-codec: Swap module clock/reset dependencies

This matches the module power-up/down sequence from the vendor's driver.

While updating these widgets/routes, reorder them to match the register
and bit layout of the hardware. This puts them in the same place in the
widget and route arrays (previously they were at opposite ends), and it
makes it easier to track which parts of which registers are implemented.
