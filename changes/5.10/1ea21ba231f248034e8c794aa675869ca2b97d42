powerpc: Move arch_cpu_idle_dead() into smp.c

arch_cpu_idle_dead() is in idle.c, which makes sense, but it's inside
a CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU block.

It would be more at home in smp.c, inside the existing
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU block. Note that CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU depends on
CONFIG_SMP so even though smp.c is not built for SMP=n builds, that's
fine.
