iio: frequency: adf4350: Replace indio_dev->mlock with own device lock

As part of the general cleanup of indio_dev->mlock, this change replaces
it with a local lock.
The lock protect the state of the device from potential concurrent writes.
The device is configured via a sequence of SPI writes, and this lock is
meant to prevent the start of another sequence before another one has
finished.

This is part of a bigger cleanup.
