phy: marvell: comphy: Convert internal SMCC firmware return codes to errno

Driver ->power_on and ->power_off callbacks leaks internal SMCC firmware
return codes to phy caller. This patch converts SMCC error codes to
standard linux errno codes. Include file linux/arm-smccc.h already provides
defines for SMCC error codes, so use them instead of custom driver defines.
Note that return value is signed 32bit, but stored in unsigned long type
with zero padding.
