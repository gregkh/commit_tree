extcon: ptn5150: Make 'vbus-gpios' optional

The PTN5150 chip can be used in hardware designs with only reporting of
USB Type-C connection, without the VBUS control.  The driver however
unconditionally expected 'vbus-gpios'.

Since all uses of the VBUS GPIO descriptor are NULL safe, the code can
accept missing GPIO and provide only extcon status reporting.
