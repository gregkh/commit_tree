libbpf: Support sleepable progs

Pass request to load program as sleepable via ".s" suffix in the section name.
If it happens in the future that all map types and helpers are allowed with
BPF_F_SLEEPABLE flag "fmod_ret/" and "lsm/" can be aliased to "fmod_ret.s/" and
"lsm.s/" to make all lsm and fmod_ret programs sleepable by default. The fentry
and fexit programs would always need to have sleepable vs non-sleepable
distinction, since not all fentry/fexit progs will be attached to sleepable
kernel functions.
