drm/i915: Revert relocation chaining commits.

This reverts commit 964a9b0f611ee ("drm/i915/gem: Use chained reloc batches")
and commit 0e97fbb080553 ("drm/i915/gem: Use a single chained reloc batches
for a single execbuf").

When adding ww locking to execbuf, it's hard enough to deal with a
single BO that is part of relocation execution. Chaining is hard to
get right, and with GPU relocation deprecated, it's best to drop this
altogether, instead of trying to fix something we will remove.

This is not a completely 1:1 revert, we reset rq_size to 0 in
reloc_cache_init, this was from e3d291301f99 ("drm/i915/gem: Implement legacy
MI_STORE_DATA_IMM"), because we don't want to break the selftests. (Daniel)
