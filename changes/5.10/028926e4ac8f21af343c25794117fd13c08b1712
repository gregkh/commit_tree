dmaengine: ioat: Allocate correct size for descriptor chunk

dma_alloc_coherent() is called with a fixed SZ_2M size, but frees happen
with IOAT_CHUNK_SIZE. Recently, IOAT_CHUNK_SIZE was reduced to 512M but
the allocation did not change. To fix, change to using the
IOAT_CHUNK_SIZE define.

This was caught with the upcoming patchset for converting Intel platforms to the
dma-iommu implementation. It has a warning when the unmapped size differs from
the mapped size.
