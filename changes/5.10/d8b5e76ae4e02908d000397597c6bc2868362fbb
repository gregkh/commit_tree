selftests/bpf/test_offload.py: Only check verifier log on verification fails

Since commit 6f8a57ccf851 ("bpf: Make verifier log more relevant by
default"), the verifier discards log messages for successfully-verified
programs. This broke test_offload.py which is looking for a verification
message from the driver callback. Change test_offload.py to use the toggle
in netdevsim to make the verification fail before looking for the
verification message.
