ASoC: Intel: Remove baytrail solution

sound/soc/intel/baytrail is a niche solution which supports limited
number of BYT products - as described by
snd_soc_acpi_intel_baytrail_legacy_machines table. For a long time it's
deprecated in favor of sound/soc/intel/atom solution with SOF providing
support for some products too effectively rendering /baytrail/ redundant.
Remove deprecated code from ASoC tree.
