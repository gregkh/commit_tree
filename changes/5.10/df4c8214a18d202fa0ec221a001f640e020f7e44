kvm: arm64: Duplicate arm64_ssbd_callback_required for nVHE hyp

Hyp keeps track of which cores require SSBD callback by accessing a
kernel-proper global variable. Create an nVHE symbol of the same name
and copy the value from kernel proper to nVHE as KVM is being enabled
on a core.

Done in preparation for separating percpu memory owned by kernel
proper and nVHE.
