net: hns3: use capabilities queried from firmware

In order to improve code maintainability and compatibility, the
capabilities of new features are queried from firmware.

The member flag in struct hnae3_ae_dev indicates not only
capabilities, but some initialized status. As capabilities bits
queried from firmware is too many, it is better to use new member
to indicate them. So adds member capabs in struce hnae3_ae_dev.
