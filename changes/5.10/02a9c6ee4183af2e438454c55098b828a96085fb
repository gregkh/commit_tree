ALSA: firewire: Clean up a locking issue in copy_resp_to_buf()

The spin_lock/unlock_irq() functions cannot be nested.  The problem is
that presumably we would want the IRQs to be re-enabled on the second
call the spin_unlock_irq() but instead it will be enabled at the first
call so IRQs will be enabled earlier than expected.

In this situation the copy_resp_to_buf() function is only called from
one function and it is called with IRQs disabled.  We can just use
the regular spin_lock/unlock() functions.
