net: mscc: ocelot: always pass skb clone to ocelot_port_add_txtstamp_skb

Currently, ocelot switchdev passes the skb directly to the function that
enqueues it to the list of skb's awaiting a TX timestamp. Whereas the
felix DSA driver first clones the skb, then passes the clone to this
queue.

This matters because in the case of felix, the common IRQ handler, which
is ocelot_get_txtstamp(), currently clones the clone, and frees the
original clone. This is useless and can be simplified by using
skb_complete_tx_timestamp() instead of skb_tstamp_tx().
