nl80211: fix PORT_AUTHORIZED wording to reflect behavior

The CMD_PORT_AUTHORIZED event was described as an event which indicated
a successfully completed 4-way handshake. But the behavior was
not as advertized. The only driver which uses this is brcmfmac, and
this driver only sends the event after a successful 802.1X-FT roam.

This prevents userspace applications from knowing if the 4-way completed
on:

1. Normal 802.1X connects
2. Normal PSK connections
3. FT-PSK roams

wpa_supplicant handles this incorrect behavior by just completing
the connection after association, before the 4-way has completed.
If the 4-way ends up failing it disconnects at that point.

Since this behavior appears to be expected (wpa_s handles it this
way) I have changed the wording in the API description to reflect the
actual behavior.
