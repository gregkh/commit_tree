libbpf: Check if pin_path was set even map fd exist

Say a user reuse map fd after creating a map manually and set the
pin_path, then load the object via libbpf.

In libbpf bpf_object__create_maps(), bpf_object__reuse_map() will
return 0 if there is no pinned map in map->pin_path. Then after
checking if map fd exist, we should also check if pin_path was set
and do bpf_map__pin() instead of continue the loop.

Fix it by creating map if fd not exist and continue checking pin_path
after that.
