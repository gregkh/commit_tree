blk-mq: Record nr_active_requests per queue for when using shared sbitmap

The per-hctx nr_active value can no longer be used to fairly assign a share
of tag depth per request queue for when using a shared sbitmap, as it does
not consider that the tags are shared tags over all hctx's.

For this case, record the nr_active_requests per request_queue, and make
the judgement based on that value.
