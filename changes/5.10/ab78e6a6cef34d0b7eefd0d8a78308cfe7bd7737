mtd: rawnand: pasemi: Make pasemi_device_ready() static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/mtd/nand/raw/pasemi_nand.c:71:5: warning:
 symbol 'pasemi_device_ready' was not declared. Should it be static?

This function is not used outside of pasemi_nand.c, so this commit
marks it static.
