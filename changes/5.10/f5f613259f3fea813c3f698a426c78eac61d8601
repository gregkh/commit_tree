checkpatch: allow not using -f with files that are in git

If a file exists in git and checkpatch is used without the -f flag for
scanning a file, then checkpatch will scan the file assuming it's a patch
and emit:

ERROR: Does not appear to be a unified-diff format patch

Change the behavior to assume the -f flag if the file exists in git.
