coresight: cti: Fix bug clearing sysfs links on callback

During module unload, a coresight driver module will call back into
the CTI driver to remove any links between the two devices.

The current code has 2 issues:-
1) in the CTI driver the matching code is matching to the wrong device
so misses all the links.
2) The callback is called too late in the unload process resulting in a
crash.

This fixes both the issues.
