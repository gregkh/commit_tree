lib/idr.c: document calling context for IDA APIs mustn't use locks

The documentation for these functions indicates that callers don't need to
hold a lock while calling them, but that documentation is only in one
place under "IDA Usage".  Let's state the same information on each IDA
function so that it's clear what the calling context requires.
Furthermore, let's document ida_simple_get() with the same information so
that callers know how this API works.
