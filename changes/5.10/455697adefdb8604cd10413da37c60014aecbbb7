arm64: Introduce separate file for spectre mitigations and reporting

The spectre mitigation code is spread over a few different files, which
makes it both hard to follow, but also hard to remove it should we want
to do that in future.

Introduce a new file for housing the spectre mitigations, and populate
it with the spectre-v1 reporting code to start with.
