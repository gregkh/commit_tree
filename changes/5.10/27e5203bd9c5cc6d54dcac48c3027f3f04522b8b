bpf: Change bpf_sk_assign to accept ARG_PTR_TO_BTF_ID_SOCK_COMMON

This patch changes the bpf_sk_assign() to take
ARG_PTR_TO_BTF_ID_SOCK_COMMON such that they will work with the pointer
returned by the bpf_skc_to_*() helpers also.

The bpf_sk_lookup_assign() is taking ARG_PTR_TO_SOCKET_"OR_NULL".  Meaning
it specifically takes a literal NULL.  ARG_PTR_TO_BTF_ID_SOCK_COMMON
does not allow a literal NULL, so another ARG type is required
for this purpose and another follow-up patch can be used if
there is such need.
