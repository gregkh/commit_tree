pinctrl: mcp23s08: Use full chunk of memory for regmap configuration

It appears that simplification of mcp23s08_spi_regmap_init() made
a regression due to wrong size calculation for dev_kmemdup() call.
It misses the fact that config variable is already a pointer, thus
the sizeof() calculation is wrong and only 4 or 8 bytes were copied.

Fix the parameters to devm_kmemdup() to copy a full chunk of memory.
