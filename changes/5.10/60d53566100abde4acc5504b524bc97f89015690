mmc: sdhci-pci: Prefer SDR25 timing for High Speed mode for BYT-based Intel controllers

A UHS setting of SDR25 can give better results for High Speed mode.
This is because there is no setting corresponding to high speed.  Currently
SDHCI sets no value, which means zero which is also the setting for SDR12.
There was an attempt to change this in sdhci.c but it caused problems for
some drivers, so it was reverted and the change was made to sdhci-brcmstb
in commit 2fefc7c5f7d16e ("mmc: sdhci-brcmstb: Fix incorrect switch to HS
mode").  Several other drivers also do this.
