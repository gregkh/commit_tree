ASoC: tas2770: Fix error handling with update_bits

snd_soc_update_bits returns a 1 when the bit was successfully updated,
returns a 0 is no update was needed and a negative if the call failed.
The code is currently failing the case of a successful update by just
checking for a non-zero number. Modify these checks and return the error
code only if there is a negative.
