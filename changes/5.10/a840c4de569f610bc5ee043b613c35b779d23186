vmlinux.lds.h: Add .symtab, .strtab, and .shstrtab to ELF_DETAILS

When linking vmlinux with LLD, the synthetic sections .symtab, .strtab,
and .shstrtab are listed as orphaned. Add them to the ELF_DETAILS section
so there will be no warnings when --orphan-handling=warn is used more
widely. (They are added above comment as it is the more common
order[1].)

ld.lld: warning: <internal>:(.symtab) is being placed in '.symtab'
ld.lld: warning: <internal>:(.shstrtab) is being placed in '.shstrtab'
ld.lld: warning: <internal>:(.strtab) is being placed in '.strtab'
