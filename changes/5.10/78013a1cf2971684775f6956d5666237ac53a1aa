ASoC: da7219: Fix clock handling around codec level probe

Previously the driver would use devm_* related functions at
the codec level probe() to allocate clock resources for MCLK
and the DAI clocks exposed by the device. This caused issues
when registering clocks on a re-probe (no device level
remove/prove involved) as the devm_* resources were never
freed up so the clocks were still registered from the previous
codec level probe().

This commit updates the clock handling for MCLK usage and DAI
clock provision to fix this discrepancy and allow the codec level
probe/remove functionality to operate as intended.
