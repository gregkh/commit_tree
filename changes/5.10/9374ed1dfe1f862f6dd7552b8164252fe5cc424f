i2c: rcar: improve bus busy detection

I2C doesn't define a timeout for bus busy, so an arbitrary value like
LOOP_TIMEOUT is not a good idea. Let's use the timeout value in struct
adapter which is meant for such cases and is user-configurable (via
IOCTL). To reduce the load, wait 10us instead of 1us which is good
enough for the slow frequencies used by I2C. Finally, use the
poll_timeout helper instead of open coding it.
