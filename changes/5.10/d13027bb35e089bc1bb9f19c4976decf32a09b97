Revert "arm64: initialize per-cpu offsets earlier"

This reverts commit 353e228eb355be5a65a3c0996c774a0f46737fda.

Qian Cai reports that TX2 no longer boots with his .config as it appears
that task_cpu() gets instrumented and used before KASAN has been
initialised.

Although Mark has a proposed fix, let's take the safe option of reverting
this for now and sorting it out properly later.
