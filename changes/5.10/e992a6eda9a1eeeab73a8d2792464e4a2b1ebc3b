genetlink: allow dumping command-specific policy

Right now CTRL_CMD_GETPOLICY can only dump the family-wide
policy. Support dumping policy of a specific op.

v3:
 - rebase after per-op policy export and handle that
v2:
 - make cmd U32, just in case.
v1:
 - don't echo op in the output in a naive way, this should
   make it cleaner to extend the output format for dumping
   policies for all the commands at once in the future.
