ASoC: SOF: imx: Add debug support for imx platforms

This patch adds debug support for imx platforms. This is important in
order to gather information about the state of the DSP in case of an
oops and the reason for the oops.

This is done by checking if a message with a panic code has been placed
in the debug box, in the imx8_dsp_handle_request function from sof/imx.

If positive, the function imx8_dump, added in common, will be called.
The first step is to gather information about the registers, filename,
line number and stack by calling the imx8_get_registers, added in common.
Then the information will be printed to the console by calling the
get_status function.
