powerpc/pseries/iommu: Move window-removing part of remove_ddw into remove_dma_window

Move the window-removing part of remove_ddw into a new function
(remove_dma_window), so it can be used to remove other DMA windows.

It's useful for removing DMA windows that don't create DIRECT64_PROPNAME
property, like the default DMA window from the device, which uses
"ibm,dma-window".
