kvm: arm64: Remove __hyp_this_cpu_read

this_cpu_ptr is meant for use in kernel proper because it selects between
TPIDR_EL1/2 based on nVHE/VHE. __hyp_this_cpu_ptr was used in hyp to always
select TPIDR_EL2. Unify all users behind this_cpu_ptr and friends by
selecting _EL2 register under __KVM_NVHE_HYPERVISOR__. VHE continues
selecting the register using alternatives.

Under CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT, the kernel helpers perform a preemption check
which is omitted by the hyp helpers. Preserve the behavior for nVHE by
overriding the corresponding macros under __KVM_NVHE_HYPERVISOR__. Extend
the checks into VHE hyp code.
