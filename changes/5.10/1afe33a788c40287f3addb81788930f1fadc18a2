Revert "USB: core: hub.c: use usb_control_msg_send() in a few places"

This reverts commit d6a499249543356002a1efbb26254c7272e62f4c.
Control messages are needed in contexts when memory allocations
are restricted, such as handling device resets and runtime PM.

For this reason the control message API internally uses GFP_NOIO.
This is a band aid introduced because when we recognized the issue,
the call chains were highly convoluted. Continuing this trend
is not a good idea.

So I am shooting the whole kennel here.
