gfs2: Eliminate gl_vm

The gfs2_glock structure has a gl_vm member, introduced in commit 7005c3e4ae428
("GFS2: Use range based functions for rgrp sync/invalidation"), which stores
the location of resource groups within their address space.  This structure is
in a union with iopen glock specific fields.  It was introduced because at
unmount time, the resource group objects were destroyed before flushing out any
pending resource group glock work, and flushing out such work could require
flushing / truncating the address space.

Since commit b3422cacdd7e6 ("gfs2: Rework how rgrp buffer_heads are managed"),
any pending resource group glock work is flushed out before destroying the
resource group objects.  So the resource group objects will now always exist in
rgrp_go_sync and rgrp_go_inval, and we now simply compute the gl_vm values
where needed instead of caching them.  This also eliminates the union.
