firmware: arm_sdei: Introduce sdei_do_local_call()

During the CPU hotplug, the private events are registered, enabled
or unregistered on the specific CPU. It repeats the same steps:
initializing cross call argument, make function call on local CPU,
check the returned error.

This introduces sdei_do_local_call() to cover the first steps. The
other benefit is to make CROSSCALL_INIT and struct sdei_crosscall_args
are only visible to sdei_do_{cross, local}_call().
