ASoC: SOF: topology: make process type optional

As components can be now identified with a UUID based mechanism, the
process type is no longer required. For new DSP components, process and
its component type can be set to SOF_PROCESS_NONE and SOF_COMP_NONE.
Allow this combination in topology load, modify the load time check for
process type to reflect this.
