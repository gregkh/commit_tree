media: glossary.rst: use the right case for glossary entries

Sphinx 3.x is pedantic with glossary entries:

    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:17: WARNING: term device driver not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to Device Driver instead.
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:59: WARNING: term media hardware not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to Media Hardware instead.
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:59: WARNING: term IP block not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to IP Block instead.
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:64: WARNING: term hardware component not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to Hardware Component instead.
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:64: WARNING: term ip block not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to IP Block instead.
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:70: WARNING: term peripheral not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to Peripheral instead.
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:130: WARNING: term V4L2 hardware not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to V4L2 Hardware instead.
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:151: WARNING: term hardware peripheral not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to Hardware Peripheral instead.
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:183: WARNING: term device node not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to Device Node instead.
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/glossary.rst:191: WARNING: term bridge driver not found in case sensitive match.made a reference to Bridge Driver instead.

While it works with case-insensitive entires, it complains.

Let's fix it, in order to cleanup the warnings. Also, I won't
doubt that a later change on Sphinx will end breaking support
for it.
