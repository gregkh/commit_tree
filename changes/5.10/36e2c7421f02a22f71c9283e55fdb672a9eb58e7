fs: don't allow splice read/write without explicit ops

default_file_splice_write is the last piece of generic code that uses
set_fs to make the uaccess routines operate on kernel pointers.  It
implements a "fallback loop" for splicing from files that do not actually
provide a proper splice_read method.  The usual file systems and other
high bandwidth instances all provide a ->splice_read, so this just removes
support for various device drivers and procfs/debugfs files.  If splice
support for any of those turns out to be important it can be added back
by switching them to the iter ops and using generic_file_splice_read.
