ARM: 9008/1: uncompress: Drop excess whitespace print

This drops some whitespace from the debug message about
where we move the compressed kernel: r after the message
is completely surplus since the putc routine will anyway
add r after n, and the initial linefeed just assumes
that this will always be the first message on the console,
which is not certain to be true.
