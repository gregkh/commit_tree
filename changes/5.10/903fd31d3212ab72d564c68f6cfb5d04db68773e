powerpc/64: fix irq replay missing preempt

Prior to commit 3282a3da25bd ("powerpc/64: Implement soft interrupt
replay in C"), replayed interrupts returned by the regular interrupt
exit code, which performs preemption in case an interrupt had set
need_resched.

This logic was missed by the conversion. Adding preempt_disable/enable
around the interrupt replay and final irq enable will reschedule if
needed.
