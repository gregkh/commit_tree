fs: dlm: use free_con to free connection

This patch use free_con() functionality to free the listen connection if
listen fails. It also fixes an issue that a freed resource is still part
of the connection_hash as hlist_del() is not called in this case. The
only difference is that free_con() handles othercon as well, but this is
never been set for the listen connection.
