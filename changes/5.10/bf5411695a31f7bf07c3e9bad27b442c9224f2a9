perf tools: Pass build_id object to build_id__sprintf()

Passing build_id object to build_id__sprintf function, so it can operate
with the proper size of build id.

This will create proper md5 build id readable names,
like following:

  a50e350e97c43b4708d09bcd85ebfff7

instead of:

  a50e350e97c43b4708d09bcd85ebfff700000000
