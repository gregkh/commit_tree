crypto: sun8i-ce - Add support for the TRNG

This patch had support for the TRNG present in the CE.
Note that according to the algorithm ID, 2 version of the TRNG exists,
the first present in H3/H5/R40/A64 and the second present in H6.
This patch adds support for both, but only the second is working
reliabily according to rngtest.
