ARM: dts: exynos: Move fixed clocks under root node in Exynos3250

The fixed clocks are kept under dedicated node fixed-rate-clocks, thus a
fake "reg" was added.  This is not correct with dtschema as fixed-clock
binding does not have a "reg" property:

  arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos3250-artik5-eval.dt.yaml: clock@0: 'reg' does not match any of the regexes: 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'
