btrfs: call btrfs_try_granting_tickets when unpinning anything

When unpinning we were only calling btrfs_try_granting_tickets() if
global_rsv->space_info == space_info, which is problematic because we
use ticketing for SYSTEM chunks, and want to use it for DATA as well.
Fix this by moving this call outside of that if statement.
