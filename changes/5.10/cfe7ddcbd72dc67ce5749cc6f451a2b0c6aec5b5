ARM, sched/topology: Remove SD_SHARE_POWERDOMAIN

This flag was introduced in 2014 by commit:

  d77b3ed5c9f8 ("sched: Add a new SD_SHARE_POWERDOMAIN for sched_domain")

but AFAIA it was never leveraged by the scheduler. The closest thing I can
think of is EAS caring about frequency domains, and it does that by
leveraging performance domains.

Remove the flag. No change in functionality is expected.
