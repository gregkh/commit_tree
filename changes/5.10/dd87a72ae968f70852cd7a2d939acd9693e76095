soundwire: enable Data Port test modes

Test modes are required for all SoundWire IP, and help debug
integration issues. In theory each port can be configured with a
different mode but to simplify this patch only offers separate
configurations for the Master and Slave ports - this covers 99% of the
intended cases during platform integration.

The test mode value is set via platform-specific ways.
