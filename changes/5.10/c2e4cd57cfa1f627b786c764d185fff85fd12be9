block: lift setting the readahead size into the block layer

Drivers shouldn't really mess with the readahead size, as that is a VM
concept.  Instead set it based on the optimal I/O size by lifting the
algorithm from the md driver when registering the disk.  Also set
bdi->io_pages there as well by applying the same scheme based on
max_sectors.  To ensure the limits work well for stacking drivers a
new helper is added to update the readahead limits from the block
limits, which is also called from disk_stack_limits.
