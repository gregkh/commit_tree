scripts: kernel-doc: use :c:union when needed

Sphinx C domain code after 3.2.1 will start complaning if :c:struct
would be used for an union type:

	.../Documentation/gpu/drm-kms-helpers:352: ../drivers/video/hdmi.c:851: WARNING: C 'identifier' cross-reference uses wrong tag: reference name is 'union hdmi_infoframe' but found name is 'struct hdmi_infoframe'. Full reference name is 'union hdmi_infoframe'. Full found name is 'struct hdmi_infoframe'.

So, let's address this issue too in advance, in order to
avoid future issues.
