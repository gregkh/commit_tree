ASoC: Intel: catpt: PCM operations

DSP designed for Lynxpoint and Wildcat Point offers no dynamic topology
i.e. all pipelines are already defined within firmware and host is
relegated to allocing stream for predefined pins. This is represented by
'catpt_topology' member.

Implementation covers all available pin types:
- system playback and capture
- two offload streams
- loopback (reference)
- bluetooth playback and capture

PCM DAI operations differentiate between those pins as some (mainly
offload) are to be handled differently - DSP expects wp updates on each
notify_position notification.

System playback has no volume control capability as it is routed to
mixer stream directly. Other primary streams - capture and two offloads
- offer individual volume controls.

Compared to sound/soc/intel/haswell this configures SSP device format
automatically on pcm creation.
