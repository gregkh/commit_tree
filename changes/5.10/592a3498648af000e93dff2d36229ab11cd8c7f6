bpf: Change bpf_sk_storage_*() to accept ARG_PTR_TO_BTF_ID_SOCK_COMMON

This patch changes the bpf_sk_storage_*() to take
ARG_PTR_TO_BTF_ID_SOCK_COMMON such that they will work with the pointer
returned by the bpf_skc_to_*() helpers also.

A micro benchmark has been done on a "cgroup_skb/egress" bpf program
which does a bpf_sk_storage_get().  It was driven by netperf doing
a 4096 connected UDP_STREAM test with 64bytes packet.
The stats from "kernel.bpf_stats_enabled" shows no meaningful difference.

The sk_storage_get_btf_proto, sk_storage_delete_btf_proto,
btf_sk_storage_get_proto, and btf_sk_storage_delete_proto are
no longer needed, so they are removed.
