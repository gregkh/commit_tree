jbd2: avoid transaction reuse after reformatting

When ext4 is formatted with lazy_journal_init=1 and transactions from
the previous filesystem are still on disk, it is possible that they are
considered during a recovery after a crash. Because the checksum seed
has changed, the CRC check will fail, and the journal recovery fails
with checksum error although the journal is otherwise perfectly valid.
Fix the problem by checking commit block time stamps to determine
whether the data in the journal block is just stale or whether it is
indeed corrupt.
