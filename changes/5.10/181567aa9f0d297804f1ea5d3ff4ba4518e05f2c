drm/i915: Do YCbCr 444->420 conversion via DP protocol converters

For platforms that can't do native 4:2:0 outout we may still be
able to do it by getting the DP->HDMI protocol converter to
perform the 4:4:4->4:2:0 downsamling for us. In this case we
have to configure our hardware to output YCbCr 4:4:4, which we've
already hooked up so all we need to do is flip the switch.
