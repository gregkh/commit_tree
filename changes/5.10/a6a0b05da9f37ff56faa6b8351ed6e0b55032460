kvm: x86/mmu: Support dirty logging for the TDP MMU

Dirty logging is a key feature of the KVM MMU and must be supported by
the TDP MMU. Add support for both the write protection and PML dirty
logging modes.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.
