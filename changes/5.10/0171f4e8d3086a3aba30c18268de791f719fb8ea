net: intel: Remove in_interrupt() warnings

in_interrupt() is ill defined and does not provide what the name
suggests. The usage especially in driver code is deprecated and a tree wide
effort to clean up and consolidate the (ab)usage of in_interrupt() and
related checks is happening.

In this case the checks cover only parts of the contexts in which these
functions cannot be called. They fail to detect preemption or interrupt
disabled invocations.

As the functions which are invoked from the various places contain already
a broad variety of checks (always enabled or debug option dependent) cover
all invalid conditions already, there is no point in having inconsistent
warnings in those drivers.

Just remove them.
