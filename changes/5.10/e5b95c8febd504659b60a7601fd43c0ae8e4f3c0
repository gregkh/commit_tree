media: i2c: fix error check on max9286_read call

Currently the error return from the call to max9286_read is masked
with 0xf0 so the following check for a negative error return is
never true.  Fix this by checking for an error first, then masking
the return value for subsequent conflink_mask checking.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Logically dead code")
