RDMA/cma: Combine cma_ndev_work with cma_work

These are the same thing, except that cma_ndev_work doesn't have a state
transition. Signal no state transition by setting old_state and new_state
== 0.

In all cases the handler function should not be called once
rdma_destroy_id() has progressed passed setting the state.
