ath11k: fix missing error check on call to ath11k_pci_get_user_msi_assignment

The return error check on the call to ath11k_pci_get_user_msi_assignment is
missing.  If an error does occur, num_vectors is still set to zero and
later on a division by zero can occur when variable vector is being
calculated.  Fix this by adding an error check after the call.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Division or modulo by zero")
