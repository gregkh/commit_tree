ASoC: SOF: intel: hda: support also devices with 1 and 3 dmics

Currently the dmic check code supports only devices with 2 or 4 dmics.
With other dmic counts the function will return 0. Lately we've seen
devices with only 1 dmic thus enable also configurations with 1, and
possibly 3, dmics. Add also topology postfix -1ch and -3ch for new dmic
configuration.
