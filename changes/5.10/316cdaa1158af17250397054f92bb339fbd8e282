net: add option to not create fall-back tunnels in root-ns as well

The sysctl that was added  earlier by commit 79134e6ce2c ("net: do
not create fallback tunnels for non-default namespaces") to create
fall-back only in root-ns. This patch enhances that behavior to provide
option not to create fallback tunnels in root-ns as well. Since modules
that create fallback tunnels could be built-in and setting the sysctl
value after booting is pointless, so added a kernel cmdline options to
change this default. The default setting is preseved for backward
compatibility. The kernel command line option of fb_tunnels=initns will
set the sysctl value to 1 and will create fallback tunnels only in initns
while kernel cmdline fb_tunnels=none will set the sysctl value to 2 and
fallback tunnels are skipped in every netns.
