tcp: bpf: Add TCP_BPF_DELACK_MAX setsockopt

This change is mostly from an internal patch and adapts it from sysctl
config to the bpf_setsockopt setup.

The bpf_prog can set the max delay ack by using
bpf_setsockopt(TCP_BPF_DELACK_MAX).  This max delay ack can be communicated
to its peer through bpf header option.  The receiving peer can then use
this max delay ack and set a potentially lower rto by using
bpf_setsockopt(TCP_BPF_RTO_MIN) which will be introduced
in the next patch.

Another later selftest patch will also use it like the above to show
how to write and parse bpf tcp header option.
