seqlock: Use unique prefix for seqcount_t property accessors

At seqlock.h, the following set of functions:

    - __seqcount_ptr()
    - __seqcount_preemptible()
    - __seqcount_assert()

act as plain seqcount_t "property" accessors. Meanwhile, the following
group:

    - __seqcount_ptr()
    - __seqcount_lock_preemptible()
    - __seqcount_assert_lock_held()

act as the equivalent set, but in the generic form, taking either
seqcount_t or any of the seqcount_LOCKNAME_t variants.

This is quite confusing, especially the first member where it is called
exactly the same in both groups.

Differentiate the first group by using "__seqprop" as prefix, and also
use that same prefix for all of seqcount_LOCKNAME_t property accessors.

While at it, constify the property accessors first parameter when
appropriate.
