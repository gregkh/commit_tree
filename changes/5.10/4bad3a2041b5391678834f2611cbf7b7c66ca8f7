ath9k: add NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_CAN_REPLACE_PTK0 support

The ath9k driver was so far only able to rekey PTK0 keys correctly due
to the best effort queue flush added with commit 62872a9b9a10
("mac80211: Fix PTK rekey freezes and clear text leak").

Add the needed queue flush and set NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_CAN_REPLACE_PTK0
to tell mac80211 that the driver can now rekey PTK0 keys correctly and
no longer needs the best effort flush.

Effectively this prevents mac80211 to warn when rekeying a PTK0 key
only.
