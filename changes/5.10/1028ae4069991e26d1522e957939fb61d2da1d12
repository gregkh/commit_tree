bpf: Deref map in BPF_PROG_BIND_MAP when it's already used

We are missing a deref for the case when we are doing BPF_PROG_BIND_MAP
on a map that's being already held by the program.
There is 'if (ret) bpf_map_put(map)' below which doesn't trigger
because we don't consider this an error.
Let's add missing bpf_map_put() for this specific condition.
