btrfs: remove err variable from btrfs_get_extent

There's no practical reason too use 'err' as a variable to convey
errors. In fact it's value is either set explicitly in the beginning of
the function or it simply takes the value of 'ret'. Not conforming to
the usual pattern of having ret be the only variable used to convey
errors makes the code more error prone to bugs. In fact one such bug
was introduced by 6bf9e4bd6a27 ("btrfs: inode: Verify inode mode toi
avoid NULL pointer dereference") by assigning the error value to 'ret'
and not 'err'.

Let's fix that issue and make the function less tricky by leaving only
ret to convey error values.
