dm table: stack 'chunk_sectors' limit to account for target-specific splitting

If target set ti->max_io_len it must be used when stacking
DM device's queue_limits to establish a 'chunk_sectors' that is
compatible with the IO stack.

By using lcm_not_zero() care is taken to avoid blindly overriding the
chunk_sectors limit stacked up by blk_stack_limits().
