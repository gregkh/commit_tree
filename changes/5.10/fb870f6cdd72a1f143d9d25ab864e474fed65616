btrfs: remove item_size member of struct btrfs_clone_extent_info

The value of item_size of struct btrfs_clone_extent_info is always set to
the size of a non-inline file extent item, and in fact the infrastructure
that uses this structure (btrfs_punch_hole_range()) does not work with
inline file extents at all (and it is not supposed to).

So just remove that field from the structure and use directly
sizeof(struct btrfs_file_extent_item) instead. Also assert that the
file extent type is not inline at btrfs_insert_clone_extent().
