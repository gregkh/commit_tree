media: dvb-frontends: tda18271c2dd: Constify static structs

Constify a number of static structs that were not modified. In order to
be able to do that, const input arguments to a couple of functions that
not modify their argument. This allows the compiler to put them in
read-only memory, resulting in about 6k memory being read-only, and the
resulting module is 400 bytes smaller.
