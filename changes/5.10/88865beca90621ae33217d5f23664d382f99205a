KVM: arm64: Mask out filtered events in PCMEID{0,1}_EL1

As we can now hide events from the guest, let's also adjust its view of
PCMEID{0,1}_EL1 so that it can figure out why some common events are not
counting as they should.

The astute user can still look into the TRM for their CPU and find out
they've been cheated, though. Nobody's perfect.
