regulator: Avoid grabbing regulator lock during suspend/resume

I see it takes about 5us per regulator to grab the lock, check that this
regulator isn't going to do anything for suspend, and then release the
lock. When that is combined with PMICs that have dozens of regulators we
get into a state where we spend a few miliseconds doing a bunch of
locking operations synchronously to figure out that there's nothing to
do. Let's reorganize the code here a bit so that we don't grab the lock
until we're actually going to do something so that suspend is a little
faster.
