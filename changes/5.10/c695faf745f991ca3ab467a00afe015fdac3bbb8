ath11k: wmi: remove redundant configuration values from init

In commit 2d4bcbed5b7d ("ath11k: initialize wmi config based on hw_params") the
wmi config initialisation was moved to hw_ops->wmi_init_config() but the old
initialisation values were accidentally left to ath11k_wmi_cmd_init(). This
is very confusing, so remove the redundant values.

And this was actually so confusing that in commit aa2092a9bab3 ("ath11k: add
raw mode and software crypto support") I actually it caused a bug: when
ATH11K_FLAG_RAW_MODE was enabled rx_decap_mode was assigned back to
TARGET_DECAP_MODE_NATIVE_WIFI in ath11k_init_wmi_config_ipq8074(). Fix this at
the same time.

Compile tested only.
