mm/mmap: rename __vma_unlink_common() to __vma_unlink()

__vma_unlink_common() and __vma_unlink() are counterparts.  Since there is
no function named __vma_unlink(), let's rename __vma_unlink_common() to
__vma_unlink() to make the code more self-explanatory and easy for
audience to understand.

Otherwise we may expect there are several variants of vma_unlink() and
__vma_unlink_common() is used by them.
