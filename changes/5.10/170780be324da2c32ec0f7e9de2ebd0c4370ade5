MIPS/jazzdma: decouple from dma-direct

The jazzdma ops implement support for a very basic IOMMU.  Thus we really
should not use the dma-direct code that takes physical address limits
into account.  This survived through the great MIPS DMA ops cleanup mostly
because I was lazy, but now it is time to fully split the implementations.
