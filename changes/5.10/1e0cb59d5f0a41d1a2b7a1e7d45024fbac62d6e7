ACPI: Make acpi_evaluate_dsm() prototype consistent

When compiling a driver which includes both include/linux/acpi.h and
include/acpi/acpi_bus.h for when CONFIG_ACPI=n for i386, I get this:

/include/acpi/acpi_bus.h:53:20: error: conflicting types for ‘acpi_evaluate_dsm’
 union acpi_object *acpi_evaluate_dsm(acpi_handle handle, const guid_t *guid,
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In file included from drivers/scsi/hisi_sas/hisi_sas.h:10:0,
                 from drivers/scsi/hisi_sas/hisi_sas_main.c:7:
./include/linux/acpi.h:866:34: note: previous definition of ‘acpi_evaluate_dsm’ was here
 static inline union acpi_object *acpi_evaluate_dsm(acpi_handle handle,
                                  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fix by making prototype in include/linux/acpi.h consistent.
