docs: ABI: sysfs-class-led-trigger-pattern: remove hw_pattern duplication

The ABI files are supposed to be unique. Yet,
in the specific case of hw_pattern, there are some duplicated
entries as warned by scripts/get_abi.pl:

	Warning: /sys/class/leds/<led>/hw_pattern is defined 3 times:  Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-trigger-pattern:14  Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-driver-sc27xx:0  Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-driver-el15203000:0

Drop the duplication from the ABI files, moving the specific
definitions to files inside Documentation/leds.
