memory: emif: Convert to DEFINE_SHOW_ATTRIBUTE

Use DEFINE_SHOW_ATTRIBUTE macro to simplify the code.

Along with this change, we get additionally:
        .owner          = THIS_MODULE,
        .llseek         = seq_lseek,

1. The llseek method is used to change the current read/write position
in a file which can be ignored if you don't use it.
2. The owner is not even a method. Instead, it is a pointer to the
module that “owns” this structure; it is used by the kernel to maintain
the module's usage count which can be ignored.
