KVM: x86: Add intr/vectoring info and error code to kvm_exit tracepoint

Extend the kvm_exit tracepoint to align it with kvm_nested_vmexit in
terms of what information is captured.  On SVM, add interrupt info and
error code, while on VMX it add IDT vectoring and error code.  This
sets the stage for macrofying the kvm_exit tracepoint definition so that
it can be reused for kvm_nested_vmexit without loss of information.

Opportunistically stuff a zero for VM_EXIT_INTR_INFO if the VM-Enter
failed, as the field is guaranteed to be invalid.  Note, it'd be
possible to further filter the interrupt/exception fields based on the
VM-Exit reason, but the helper is intended only for tracepoints, i.e.
an extra VMREAD or two is a non-issue, the failed VM-Enter case is just
low hanging fruit.
