RDMA/mlx5: Disable IB_DEVICE_MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS if IB_WR_REG_MR can't work

set_reg_wr() always fails if !umr_modify_entity_size_disabled because
mlx5_ib_can_use_umr() always fails. Without set_reg_wr() IB_WR_REG_MR
doesn't work and that means the device should not advertise
IB_DEVICE_MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS.
