drm/amdgpu: new ids flag for tmz (v2)

Allows UMD to know if TMZ is supported and enabled.

This commit also bumps KMS_DRIVER_MINOR because if we don't
UMD can't tell if "ids_flags & AMDGPU_IDS_FLAGS_TMZ == 0" means
"tmz is not enabled" or "tmz may be enabled but the kernel doesn't
report it".

v2: use amdgpu_is_tmz() and reworded commit message.
