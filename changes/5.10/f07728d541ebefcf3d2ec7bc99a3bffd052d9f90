btrfs: clean up NULL checks in qgroup_unreserve_range()

Smatch complains that this code dereferences "entry" before checking
whether it's NULL on the next line.  Fortunately, rb_entry() will never
return NULL so it doesn't cause a problem.  We can clean up the NULL
checking a bit to silence the warning and make the code more clear.
