ethtool: strset: allow ETHTOOL_A_STRSET_COUNTS_ONLY attr

The ETHTOOL_A_STRSET_COUNTS_ONLY flag attribute was previously
not allowed to be used, but now due to the policy size reduction
we would access the tb[] array out of bounds since we tried to
check for the attribute despite it not being accepted.

Fix both issues by adding it correctly to the appropriate policy.

Fixes: 71921690f974 ("ethtool: provide string sets with STRSET_GET request")
