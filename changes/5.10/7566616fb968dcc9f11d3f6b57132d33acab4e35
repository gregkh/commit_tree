tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Fix missing base-freq core IDs

The reported base-freq high-priority-cpu-list was potentially omitting
some cpus, due to incorrectly using a logical core count to constrain
the size of a physical punit core ID mask. We may need to read both high
and low PBF CORE_MASK values regardless of the logical core count.
