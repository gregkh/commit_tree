powerpc/mm: move setting pte specific flags to pfn_pte

powerpc used to set the pte specific flags in set_pte_at().  This is
different from other architectures.  To be consistent with other
architecture update pfn_pte to set _PAGE_PTE on ppc64.  Also, drop now
unused pte_mkpte.

We add a VM_WARN_ON() to catch the usage of calling set_pte_at() without
setting _PAGE_PTE bit.  We will remove that after a few releases.

With respect to huge pmd entries, pmd_mkhuge() takes care of adding the
_PAGE_PTE bit.
