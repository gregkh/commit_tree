bpf: sockmap: Enable map_update_elem from bpf_iter

Allow passing a pointer to a BTF struct sock_common* when updating
a sockmap or sockhash. Since BTF pointers can fault and therefore be
NULL at runtime we need to add an additional !sk check to
sock_map_update_elem. Since we may be passed a request or timewait
socket we also need to check sk_fullsock. Doing this allows calling
map_update_elem on sockmap from bpf_iter context, which uses
BTF pointers.
