x86/tsc: Use seqcount_latch_t

Latch sequence counters have unique read and write APIs, and thus
seqcount_latch_t was recently introduced at seqlock.h.

Use that new data type instead of plain seqcount_t. This adds the
necessary type-safety and ensures that only latching-safe seqcount APIs
are to be used.
