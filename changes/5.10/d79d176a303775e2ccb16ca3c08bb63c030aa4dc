mm/hugetlb.c: remove the unnecessary non_swap_entry()

If a swap entry tests positive for either is_[migration|hwpoison]_entry(),
then its swap_type() is among SWP_MIGRATION_READ, SWP_MIGRATION_WRITE and
SWP_HWPOISON.  All these types >= MAX_SWAPFILES, exactly what is asserted
with non_swap_entry().

So the checking non_swap_entry() in is_hugetlb_entry_migration() and
is_hugetlb_entry_hwpoisoned() is redundant.

Let's remove it to optimize code.
