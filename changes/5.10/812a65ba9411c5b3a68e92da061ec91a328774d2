drm/bridge: ps8640: Return an error for incorrect attach flags

Bridge drivers that implement the new model only shall return an error
from their attach() handler when the DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR flag
is not set. So make sure we return an error because only the new
drm_bridge model is supported.
