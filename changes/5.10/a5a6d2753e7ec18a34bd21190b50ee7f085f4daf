usb: typec: intel_pmc_mux: Support for device role (UFP)

This adds support for device data role, and data role
swapping. The driver no longer relies on the cached role, as
it may not be valid (for example after bootup). Instead, the
role is always checked by readding the port status from IOM.

Note. After this, the orientation is always only cached, so
the driver does not support scenario where the role is set
before orientation. It means the typec drivers must always
set the orientation first before role.
