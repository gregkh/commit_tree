can: flexcan: flexcan_setup_stop_mode(): add missing "req_bit" to stop mode property comment

In the patch

    d9b081e3fc4b ("can: flexcan: remove ack_grp and ack_bit handling from driver")

the unused ack_grp and ack_bit were removed from the driver. However in the
comment, the "req_bit" was accidentally removed, too.

This patch adds back the "req_bit" bit.
