media: staging: atomisp: Remove unnecessary 'fallthrough'

commit df561f6688fe ("treewide: Use fallthrough pseudo-keyword") from
Gustavo A. R. Silva replaced and standardized /* fallthrough */ comments
with 'fallthrough' pseudo-keyword.

However, in one of the switch-case statements, Coverity Static Analyzer
throws a warning that 'fallthrough' is unreachable due to the adjacent
'return false' statement. (Coverity ID CID 1466511)

In order to fix the unreachable code warning, remove unnecessary
fallthrough keyword.
