arm64: dts: allwinner: beelink-gs1: Enable both RGMII RX/TX delay

Before the commit bbc4d71d6354 ("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e rx/tx
delay config"), the software overwrite for RX/TX delays of the RTL8211e
were not working properly and the Beelink GS1 had both RX/TX delay of RGMII
interface set using pull-up on the TXDLY and RXDLY pins.

Now that these delays are working properly they overwrite the HW
config and set this to 'rgmii' meaning no delay on both RX/TX.
This makes the ethernet of this board not working anymore.

Set the phy-mode to 'rgmii-id' meaning RGMII with RX/TX delays
in the device-tree to keep the correct configuration.
