Revert "drm/i915/gem: Split eb_vma into its own allocation"

This reverts commit 0f1dd02295f3 ("drm/i915/gem: Split eb_vma into
its own allocation") and also moves all unreserving to a single
place at the end, which is a minor simplification.

With the WW locking, we will drop all references only at the
end when unlocking, so refcounting can now be removed.
