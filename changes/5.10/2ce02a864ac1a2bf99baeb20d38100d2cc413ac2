PCI: Add schedule point in pci_read_config()

The PCI sysfs "config" file allows large reads, and the resulting PCI
config reads can take several milliseconds to complete.  Testing with the
cyclictest [1] benchmark showed 5ms+ latencies.

Add a schedule point in pci_read_config() to reduce the maximum latency.
