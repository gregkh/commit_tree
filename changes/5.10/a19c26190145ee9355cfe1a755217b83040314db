net: usb: kaweth: Remove last user of kaweth_control()

kaweth_async_set_rx_mode() invokes kaweth_contol() and has two callers:

- kaweth_open() which is invoked from preemptible context
.
- kaweth_start_xmit() which holds a spinlock and has bottom halfs disabled.

If called from kaweth_start_xmit() kaweth_async_set_rx_mode() obviously
cannot block, which means it can't call kaweth_control(). This is detected
with an in_interrupt() check.

Replace the in_interrupt() check in kaweth_async_set_rx_mode() with an
argument which is set true by the caller if the context is safe to sleep,
otherwise false.

Now kaweth_control() is only called from preemptible context which means
there is no need for GFP_ATOMIC allocations anymore. Replace it with
usb_control_msg(). Cleanup the code a bit while at it.

Finally remove kaweth_control() since the last user is gone.
