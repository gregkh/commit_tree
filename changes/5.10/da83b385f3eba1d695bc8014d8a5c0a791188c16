drm/amd/display: Display goes blank after inst

[why]
Display goes blank after driver installation.
Aux tuning parameters must be used for 2.x only.
Wrong dc_golden_table offset was used.

[How]
Implement a new enc3_hw_init function without VBIOS constants usage to
be called for 3.x
Calculate dc_golden_table offset using sum of
base dce_info offset and golden table offset
