phy: fix USB_LGM_PHY warning & build errors

Fix a Kconfig warning that is causing lots of build errors
when USB_SUPPORT is not set.

USB_PHY depends on USB_SUPPORT but "select" doesn't care about
dependencies, so this driver should also depend on USB_SUPPORT.
It should not select USB_SUPPORT.

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for USB_PHY
  Depends on [n]: USB_SUPPORT [=n]
  Selected by [m]:
  - USB_LGM_PHY [=m]
