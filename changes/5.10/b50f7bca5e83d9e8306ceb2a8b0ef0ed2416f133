intel-ethernet: clean up W=1 warnings in kdoc

This takes care of all of the trivial W=1 fixes in the Intel
Ethernet drivers, which allows developers and maintainers to
build more of the networking tree with more complete warning
checks.

There are three classes of kdoc warnings fixed:
 - cannot understand function prototype: 'x'
 - Excess function parameter 'x' description in 'y'
 - Function parameter or member 'x' not described in 'y'

All of the changes were trivial comment updates on
function headers.

Inspired by Lee Jones' series of wireless work to do the same.
Compile tested only, and passes simple test of
$ git ls-files *.[ch] | egrep drivers/net/ethernet/intel | \
  xargs scripts/kernel-doc -none
