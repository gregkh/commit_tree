drm/i915: Remove requirement for holding i915_request.lock for breadcrumbs

Since the breadcrumb enabling/cancelling itself is serialised by the
breadcrumbs.irq_lock, with a bit of care we can remove the outer
serialisation with i915_request.lock for concurrent
dma_fence_enable_signaling(). This has the important side-effect of
eliminating the nested i915_request.lock within request submission.

The challenge in serialisation is around the unsubmission where we take
an active request that wants a breadcrumb on the signaling engine and
put it to sleep. We do not want a concurrent
dma_fence_enable_signaling() to attach a breadcrumb as we unsubmit, so
we must mark the request as no longer active before serialising with the
concurrent enable-signaling.

On retire, we serialise with the concurrent enable-signaling, but
instead of clearing ACTIVE, we mark it as SIGNALED.
