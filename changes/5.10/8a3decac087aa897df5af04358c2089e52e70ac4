ACPI: Add out of bounds and numa_off protections to pxm_to_node()

The function should check the validity of the pxm value before using
it to index the pxm_to_node_map[] array.

Whilst hardening this code may be good in general, the main intent
here is to enable following patches that use this function to replace
acpi_map_pxm_to_node() for non SRAT usecases which should return
NO_NUMA_NODE for PXM entries not matching with those in SRAT.
