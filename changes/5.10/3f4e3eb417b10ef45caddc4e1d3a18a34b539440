KVM: x86: bump KVM_MAX_CPUID_ENTRIES

As vcpu->arch.cpuid_entries is now allocated dynamically, the only
remaining use for KVM_MAX_CPUID_ENTRIES is to check KVM_SET_CPUID/
KVM_SET_CPUID2 input for sanity. Since it was reported that the
current limit (80) is insufficient for some CPUs, bump
KVM_MAX_CPUID_ENTRIES and use an arbitrary value '256' as the new
limit.
