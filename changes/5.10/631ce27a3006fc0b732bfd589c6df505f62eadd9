bnxt_en: Invoke cancel_delayed_work_sync() for PFs also.

As part of the commit b148bb238c02
("bnxt_en: Fix possible crash in bnxt_fw_reset_task()."),
cancel_delayed_work_sync() is called only for VFs to fix a possible
crash by cancelling any pending delayed work items. It was assumed
by mistake that the flush_workqueue() call on the PF would flush
delayed work items as well.

As flush_workqueue() does not cancel the delayed workqueue, extend
the fix for PFs. This fix will avoid the system crash, if there are
any pending delayed work items in fw_reset_task() during driver's
.remove() call.

Unify the workqueue cleanup logic for both PF and VF by calling
cancel_work_sync() and cancel_delayed_work_sync() directly in
bnxt_remove_one().
