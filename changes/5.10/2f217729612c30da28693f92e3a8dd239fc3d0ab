media: vidtv: cleanup SDT string identifiers

In order to better test userspace applications, add an encoding
for the strings. The original channel string is also too big.
As we're just playing the first compasses of the 5th Beethoven
Symphony, change the service name to just "Beethoven". Also,
add a provider's name. For such purpose, let's point it to
the Linux media community website.

With such changes, the SDT table now looks more like one got
from a real digital TV channel:
