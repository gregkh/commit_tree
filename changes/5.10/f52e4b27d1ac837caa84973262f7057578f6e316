l2tp: fix up inconsistent rx/tx statistics

Historically L2TP core statistics count the L2TP header in the
per-session and per-tunnel byte counts tracked for transmission and
receipt.

Now that l2tp_xmit_skb updates tx stats, it is necessary for
l2tp_xmit_core to pass out the length of the transmitted packet so that
the statistics can be updated correctly.
