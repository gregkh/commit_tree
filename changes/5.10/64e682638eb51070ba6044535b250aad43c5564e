x86/boot/compressed/64: Add IDT Infrastructure

Add code needed to setup an IDT in the early pre-decompression
boot-code. The IDT is loaded first in startup_64, which is after
EfiExitBootServices() has been called, and later reloaded when the
kernel image has been relocated to the end of the decompression area.

This allows to setup different IDT handlers before and after the
relocation.
