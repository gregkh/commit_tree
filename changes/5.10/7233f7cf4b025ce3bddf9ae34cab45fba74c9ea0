pinctrl: imx: Support building i.MX pinctrl core driver as module

Change PINCTRL_IMX to tristate to support loadable module build.

And i.MX common pinctrl driver should depend on CONFIG_OF to make sure
no build error when i.MX common pinctrl driver is enabled for different
architectures without CONFIG_OF.

Also add module author, description and license.
