arm64: dts: allwinner: Mark timer as stopped in suspend

When possible, system firmware on 64-bit Allwinner platforms disables
OSC24M during system suspend. Since this oscillator is the clock source
for the ARM architectural timer, this causes the timer to stop counting.
Therefore, the ARM architectural timer must not be marked as NONSTOP on
these platforms, or the time will be wrong after system resume.

Adding the arm,no-tick-in-suspend property forces the kernel to ignore
the ARM architectural timer when calculating sleeptime; it falls back to
reading the RTC. Note that this only affects deep suspend, not s2idle.
