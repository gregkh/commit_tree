ASoC: SOF: Intel: Use DMI oem string search for tgl_max98373_rt5682

DMI product name is used to support system variants based out of
tgl_max98373_rt5682 in current implementation. Replace this DMI search with
DMI_OEM_STRING. Coreboot(BIOS used in these systems) is
setting the needed DMI_OEM_STRING field to uniquely identify these
systems.
