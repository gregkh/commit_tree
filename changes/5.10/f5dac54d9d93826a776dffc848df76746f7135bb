ALSA: hda: Separate runtime and system suspend

Both pm_runtime_force_suspend() and pm_runtime_force_resume() have
some implicit checks, so it can make code flow more straightforward if
we separate runtime and system suspend callbacks.

High Definition Audio Specification, 4.5.9.3 Codec Wake From System S3
states that codec can wake the system up from S3 if WAKEEN is toggled.
Since HDA controller has different wakeup settings for runtime and
system susend, we also need to explicitly disable direct-complete which
can be enabled automatically by PCI core. In addition to that, avoid
waking up codec if runtime resume is for system suspend, to not break
direct-complete for codecs.

While at it, also remove AZX_DCAPS_SUSPEND_SPURIOUS_WAKEUP, as the
original bug commit a6630529aecb ("ALSA: hda: Workaround for spurious
wakeups on some Intel platforms") solves doesn't happen with this
patch.
