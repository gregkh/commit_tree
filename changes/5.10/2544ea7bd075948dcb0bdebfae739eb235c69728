iio: stm32-dac: Replace indio_dev->mlock with own device lock

As part of the general cleanup of indio_dev->mlock, this change replaces
it with a local lock. The lock protects against potential races when
reading the CR reg and then updating, so that the state of pm_runtime
is consistent between the two operations.

This is part of a bigger cleanup.
