vfio-pci/zdev: Add zPCI capabilities to VFIO_DEVICE_GET_INFO

Define a new configuration entry VFIO_PCI_ZDEV for VFIO/PCI.

When this s390-only feature is configured we add capabilities to the
VFIO_DEVICE_GET_INFO ioctl that describe features of the associated
zPCI device and its underlying hardware.

This patch is based on work previously done by Pierre Morel.
