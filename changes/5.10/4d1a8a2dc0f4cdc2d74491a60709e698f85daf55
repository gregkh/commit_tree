arm64: mte: Tags-aware aware memcmp_pages() implementation

When the Memory Tagging Extension is enabled, two pages are identical
only if both their data and tags are identical.

Make the generic memcmp_pages() a __weak function and add an
arm64-specific implementation which returns non-zero if any of the two
pages contain valid MTE tags (PG_mte_tagged set). There isn't much
benefit in comparing the tags of two pages since these are normally used
for heap allocations and likely to differ anyway.
