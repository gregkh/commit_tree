i2c: tegra: Check errors for both positive and negative values

The driver's code is inconsistent in regards to the error values checking.
The correct way should be to check both positive and negative values.
This patch cleans up the error-checks in the code. Note that the
pm_runtime_get_sync() could return positive value on success, hence only
relevant parts of the code are changed by this patch.
