drm/i915/display/ehl: Use EHL DP tables for eDP ports without low power support

Reusing icl_get_combo_buf_trans() for eDP was causing the wrong table
being used when the eDP port don't support low power voltage swing table.

v2: Only use icl_combo_phy_ddi_translations_edp_hbr3 if low_vswing is
set as EHL combo phy supports HBR3 (Matt R)
