tools/power turbostat: Support AMD Family 19h

Family 19h processors have the same RAPL (Running average power limit)
hardware register interface as Family 17h processors.

Change the family checks to succeed for Family 17h and above to enable
core and package energy measurement on Family 19h machines.

Also update the TDP to the largest found at the bottom of the page at
amd.com->processors->servers->epyc->2nd-gen-epyc, i.e., the EPYC 7H12.
