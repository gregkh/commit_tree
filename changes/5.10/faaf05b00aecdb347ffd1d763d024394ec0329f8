kvm: x86/mmu: Support zapping SPTEs in the TDP MMU

Add functions to zap SPTEs to the TDP MMU. These are needed to tear down
TDP MMU roots properly and implement other MMU functions which require
tearing down mappings. Future patches will add functions to populate the
page tables, but as for this patch there will not be any work for these
functions to do.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests on an Intel Haswell
machine. This series introduced no new failures.
