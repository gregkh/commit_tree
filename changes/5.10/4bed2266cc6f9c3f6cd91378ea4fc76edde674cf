x86/idt: Split idt_data setup out of set_intr_gate()

The code to setup idt_data is needed for early exception handling, but
set_intr_gate() can't be used that early because it has pv-ops in its
code path which don't work that early.

Split out the idt_data initialization part from set_intr_gate() so
that it can be used separately.
