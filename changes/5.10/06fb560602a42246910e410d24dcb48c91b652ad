net: mdio-ipq4019: add Clause 45 support

While up-streaming the IPQ4019 driver it was thought that the controller had no Clause 45 support,
but it actually does and its activated by writing a bit to the mode register.

So lets add it as newer SoC-s use the same controller and Clause 45 compliant PHY-s.
