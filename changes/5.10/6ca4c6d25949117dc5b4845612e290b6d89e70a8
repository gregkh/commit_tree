gen_compile_commands: do not support .cmd files under tools/ directory

The tools/ directory uses a different build system, and the format of
.cmd files is different because the tools builds run in a different
work directory.

Supporting two formats compilicates the script.

The only loss by this change is objtool.

Also, rename the confusing variable 'relative_path' because it is
not necessarily a relative path. When the output directory is not
the direct child of the source tree (e.g. O=foo/bar), it is an
absolute path. Rename it to 'file_path'.

os.path.join(root_directory, file_path) works whether the file_path
is relative or not. If file_path is already absolute, it returns it
as-is.

I used os.path.abspath() to normalize file paths. If you run this
script against the kernel built with O=foo option, the file_path
contains '../' patterns. os.path.abspath() fixes up 'foo/bar/../baz'
into 'foo/baz', and produces a cleaner commands_database.json.
