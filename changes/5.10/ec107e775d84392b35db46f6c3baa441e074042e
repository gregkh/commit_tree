igb: avoid transmit queue timeout in xdp path

Since we share the transmit queue with the network stack,
it is possible that we run into a transmit queue timeout.
This will reset the queue.
This happens under high load when XDP is using the
transmit queue pretty much exclusively.

netdev_start_xmit() sets the trans_start variable of the
transmit queue to jiffies which is later utilized by dev_watchdog(),
so to avoid timeout, let stack know that XDP xmit happened by
bumping the trans_start within XDP Tx routines to jiffies.
