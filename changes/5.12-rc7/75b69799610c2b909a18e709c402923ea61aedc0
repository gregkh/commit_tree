afs: Use wait_on_page_writeback_killable

Open-coding this function meant it missed out on the recent bugfix
for waiters being woken by a delayed wake event from a previous
instantiation of the page[1].

[DH: Changed the patch to use vmf->page rather than variable page which
 doesn't exist yet upstream]
