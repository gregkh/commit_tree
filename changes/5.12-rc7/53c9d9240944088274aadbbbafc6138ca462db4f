x86/pv: Switch SWAPGS to ALTERNATIVE

SWAPGS is used only for interrupts coming from user mode or for
returning to user mode. So there is no reason to use the PARAVIRT
framework, as it can easily be replaced by an ALTERNATIVE depending
on X86_FEATURE_XENPV.

There are several instances using the PV-aware SWAPGS macro in paths
which are never executed in a Xen PV guest. Replace those with the
plain swapgs instruction. For SWAPGS_UNSAFE_STACK the same applies.
