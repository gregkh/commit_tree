Revert "PM: ACPI: reboot: Use S5 for reboot"

This reverts commit d60cd06331a3566d3305b3c7b566e79edf4e2095.

This patch causes a panic when rebooting my Dell Poweredge r440.  I do
not have the full panic log as it's lost at that stage of the reboot and
I do not have a serial console.  Reverting this patch makes my system
able to reboot again.
