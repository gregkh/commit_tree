drm/i915/gt: Pull ring submission resume under its caller forcewake

Take advantage of calling xcs_resume under a forcewake by using direct
mmio access. In particular, we can avoid the sleeping variants to allow
resume to be called from softirq context, required for engine resets.

v2: Keep the posting read at the start of resume as a guardian memory
barrier.
