net: stmmac: dwmac-meson8b: move RGMII delays into a separate function

Newer SoCs starting with the Amlogic Meson G12A have more a precise
RGMII RX delay configuration register. This means more complexity in the
code. Extract the existing RGMII delay configuration code into a
separate function to make it easier to read/understand even when adding
more logic in the future.
