arm64: Initialise as nVHE before switching to VHE

As we are aiming to be able to control whether we enable VHE or
not, let's always drop down to EL1 first, and only then upgrade
to VHE if at all possible.

This means that if the kernel is booted at EL2, we always start
with a nVHE init, drop to EL1 to initialise the the kernel, and
only then upgrade the kernel EL to EL2 if possible (the process
is obviously shortened for secondary CPUs).

The resume path is handled similarly to a secondary CPU boot.
