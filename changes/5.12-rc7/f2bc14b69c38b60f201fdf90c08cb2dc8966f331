KVM: x86: hyper-v: Prepare to meet unallocated Hyper-V context

Currently, Hyper-V context is part of 'struct kvm_vcpu_arch' and is always
available. As a preparation to allocating it dynamically, check that it is
not NULL at call sites which can normally proceed without it i.e. the
behavior is identical to the situation when Hyper-V emulation is not being
used by the guest.

When Hyper-V context for a particular vCPU is not allocated, we may still
need to get 'vp_index' from there. E.g. in a hypothetical situation when
Hyper-V emulation was enabled on one CPU and wasn't on another, Hyper-V
style send-IPI hypercall may still be used. Luckily, vp_index is always
initialized to kvm_vcpu_get_idx() and can only be changed when Hyper-V
context is present. Introduce kvm_hv_get_vpindex() helper for
simplification.

No functional change intended.
