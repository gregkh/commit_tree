MIPS: jazz: always allow little-endian builds

The kernel test robot keeps reporting the same bug when it
shows up in new files after random unrelated patches:

The problem is that some randconfig builds end up on the MIPS jazz
platform with neither CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN nor CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
because no specific machine is selected. As it turns out, all jazz
machines support little-endian kernels, so this can simply be allowed
globally.
