arm64: dts: renesas: rzg2: Add usb2_clksel to RZ/G2 M/N/H

Per the reference manual for the RZ/G Series, 2nd Generation,
the RZ/G2M, RZ/G2N, and RZ/G2H have a bit that can be set to
choose between a crystal oscillator and an external oscillator.

Because only boards that need this should enable it, it's marked
as disabled by default for backwards compatibility with existing
boards.
