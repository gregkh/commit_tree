usb: typec: Add typec_partner_set_pd_revision

The partner's PD revision may be resolved later than the port partner
registration since the port partner creation may take place once
Type-C detects the port has changed state, but before PD communication is
completed.

Add a setter so that the partner's PD revision can be attached to it once
it becomes available.

If the revision is set to a valid version (not 0), the setter will also
refresh the partner's usb_pd flag and notify on "supports_usb_power_delivery"
sysfs property as well.
