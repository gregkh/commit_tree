net: bridge: multicast: __grp_src_block_incl can modify pg

Prepare __grp_src_block_incl() for being able to cause a notification
due to changes. Currently it cannot happen, but EHT would change that
since we'll be deleting sources immediately. Make sure that if the pg is
deleted we don't return true as that would cause the caller to access
freed pg. This patch shouldn't cause any functional change.
