pcnet32: Use pci_resource_len to validate PCI resource

pci_resource_start() is not a good indicator to determine if a PCI
resource exists or not, since the resource may start at address 0.
This is seen when trying to instantiate the driver in qemu for riscv32
or riscv64.

pci 0000:00:01.0: reg 0x10: [io  0x0000-0x001f]
pci 0000:00:01.0: reg 0x14: [mem 0x00000000-0x0000001f]
...
pcnet32: card has no PCI IO resources, aborting

Use pci_resouce_len() instead.
