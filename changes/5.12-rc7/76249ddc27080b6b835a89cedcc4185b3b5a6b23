powerpc/32: On syscall entry, enable instruction translation at the same time as data

On 40x and 8xx, kernel text is pinned.
On book3s/32, kernel text is mapped by BATs.

Enable instruction translation at the same time as data translation, it
makes things simpler.

MSR_RI can also be set at the same time because srr0/srr1 are already
saved and r1 is set properly.

On booke, translation is always on, so at the end all PPC32
have translation on early.

This reduces null_syscall benchmark by 13 cycles on 8xx
(296 ==> 283 cycles).
