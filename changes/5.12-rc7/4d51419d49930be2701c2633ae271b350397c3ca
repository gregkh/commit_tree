openvswitch: fix send of uninitialized stack memory in ct limit reply

'struct ovs_zone_limit' has more members than initialized in
ovs_ct_limit_get_default_limit().  The rest of the memory is a random
kernel stack content that ends up being sent to userspace.

Fix that by using designated initializer that will clear all
non-specified fields.
