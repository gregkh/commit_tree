net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Qualify phydev->dev_flags based on port

Similar to commit 92696286f3bb37ba50e4bd8d1beb24afb759a799 ("net:
bcmgenet: Set phydev->dev_flags only for internal PHYs") we need to
qualify the phydev->dev_flags based on whether the port is connected to
an internal or external PHY otherwise we risk having a flags collision
with a completely different interpretation depending on the driver.
