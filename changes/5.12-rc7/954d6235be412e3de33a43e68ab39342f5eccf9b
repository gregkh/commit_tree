s390/qdio: make thinint registration symmetric

tiqdio_add_device() adds the device to the tiq_list of eligible targets
for a data IRQ, which gets walked on each QDIO Adapter Interrupt to
inspect their DSCIs.

But currently the tiqdio_add_device() / tiqdio_remove_device() calls
are not symmetric - the device is removed within qdio_shutdown(),
but only added by qdio_activate().
So depending on the call sequence and encountered errors, we might
be trying to remove a list entry in qdio_shutdown() that was never even
added to the list. This required additional INIT_LIST_HEAD() calls to
ensure that the list entry was always in a consistent state.

All drivers now fence the IRQ delivery via qdio_start_irq() /
qdio_stop_irq(), so we can nicely integrate this tiq_list management
with the other steps needed for QDIO Adapter IRQ (de-)registration
(qdio_establish_thinint() / qdio_shutdown_thinint()).
As the naming suggests these get called during qdio_establish() and
qdio_shutdown(), with proper symmetry and roll-back after errors.

With this we longer need to worry about misplaced list removals, and
thus can clean up the list API abuse (INIT_LIST_HEAD() should not be
called on list entries).
