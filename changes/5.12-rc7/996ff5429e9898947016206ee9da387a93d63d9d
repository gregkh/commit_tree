KVM: x86: move kvm_inject_gp up from kvm_set_dr to callers

Push the injection of #GP up to the callers, so that they can just use
kvm_complete_insn_gp. __kvm_set_dr is pretty much what the callers can use
together with kvm_complete_insn_gp, so rename it to kvm_set_dr and drop
the old kvm_set_dr wrapper.

This also allows nested VMX code, which really wanted to use __kvm_set_dr,
to use the right function.

While at it, remove the kvm_require_dr() check from the SVM interception.
The APM states:

  All normal exception checks take precedence over the SVM intercepts.

which includes the CR4.DE=1 #UD.
