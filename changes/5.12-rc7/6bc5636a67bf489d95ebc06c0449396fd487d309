btrfs: refactor __extent_writepage_io() to improve readability

The refactoring involves the following modifications:

- iosize alignment
  In fact we don't really need to manually do alignment at all.
  All extent maps should already be aligned, thus basic ASSERT() check
  would be enough.

- redundant variables
  We have extra variable like blocksize/pg_offset/end.
  They are all unnecessary.

  @blocksize can be replaced by sectorsize size directly, and it's only
  used to verify the em start/size is aligned.

  @pg_offset can be easily calculated using @cur and page_offset(page).

  @end is just assigned from @page_end and never modified, use
  "start + PAGE_SIZE - 1" directly and remove @page_end.

- remove some BUG_ON()s
  The BUG_ON()s are for extent map, which we have tree-checker to check
  on-disk extent data item and runtime check.
  ASSERT() should be enough.
