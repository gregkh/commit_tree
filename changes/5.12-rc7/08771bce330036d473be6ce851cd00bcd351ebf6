ice: Continue probe on link/PHY errors

An incorrect NVM update procedure can result in the driver failing probe.
In this case, the recommended resolution method is to update the NVM
using the right procedure. However, if the driver fails probe, the user
will not be able to update the NVM. So do not fail probe on link/PHY
errors.
