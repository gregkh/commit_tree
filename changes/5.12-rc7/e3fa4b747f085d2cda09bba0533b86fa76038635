Drivers: hv: vmbus: Avoid use-after-free in vmbus_onoffer_rescind()

When channel->device_obj is non-NULL, vmbus_onoffer_rescind() could
invoke put_device(), that will eventually release the device and free
the channel object (cf. vmbus_device_release()).  However, a pointer
to the object is dereferenced again later to load the primary_channel.
The use-after-free can be avoided by noticing that this load/check is
redundant if device_obj is non-NULL: primary_channel must be NULL if
device_obj is non-NULL, cf. vmbus_add_channel_work().
