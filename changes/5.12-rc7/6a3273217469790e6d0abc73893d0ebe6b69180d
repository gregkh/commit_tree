net/mlx5: SF, Port function state change support

Support changing the state of the SF port's function through devlink.
When activating the SF port's function, enable the hca in the device
followed by adding its auxiliary device.
When deactivating the SF port's function, delete its auxiliary device
followed by disabling the vHCA.

Port function attributes get/set callbacks are invoked with devlink
instance lock held. Such callbacks need to synchronize with sf port
table getting disabled either via sriov sysfs callback. Such callbacks
synchronize with table disable context holding table refcount.

$ devlink dev eswitch set pci/0000:06:00.0 mode switchdev

$ devlink port show
pci/0000:06:00.0/65535: type eth netdev ens2f0np0 flavour physical port 0 splittable false

$ devlink port add pci/0000:06:00.0 flavour pcisf pfnum 0 sfnum 88
pci/0000:06:00.0/32768: type eth netdev eth6 flavour pcisf controller 0 pfnum 0 sfnum 88 external false splittable false
  function:
    hw_addr 00:00:00:00:00:00 state inactive opstate detached

$ devlink port show ens2f0npf0sf88
pci/0000:06:00.0/32768: type eth netdev ens2f0npf0sf88 flavour pcisf controller 0 pfnum 0 sfnum 88 external false splittable false
  function:
    hw_addr 00:00:00:00:88:88 state inactive opstate detached

$ devlink port function set pci/0000:06:00.0/32768 hw_addr 00:00:00:00:88:88 state active

$ devlink port show ens2f0npf0sf88 -jp
{
    "port": {
        "pci/0000:06:00.0/32768": {
            "type": "eth",
            "netdev": "ens2f0npf0sf88",
            "flavour": "pcisf",
            "controller": 0,
            "pfnum": 0,
            "sfnum": 88,
            "external": false,
            "splittable": false,
            "function": {
                "hw_addr": "00:00:00:00:88:88",
                "state": "active",
                "opstate": "attached"
            }
        }
    }
}

On port function activation, an auxiliary device is created in below
example.

$ devlink dev show
devlink dev show auxiliary/mlx5_core.sf.4

$ devlink port show auxiliary/mlx5_core.sf.4/1
auxiliary/mlx5_core.sf.4/1: type eth netdev p0sf88 flavour virtual port 0 splittable false
