libbpf: Restore umem state after socket create failure

If the call to xsk_socket__create fails, the user may want to retry the
socket creation using the same umem. Ensure that the umem is in the
same state on exit if the call fails by:
1. ensuring the umem _save pointers are unmodified.
2. not unmapping the set of umem rings that were set up with the umem
during xsk_umem__create, since those maps existed before the call to
xsk_socket__create and should remain in tact even in the event of
failure.
