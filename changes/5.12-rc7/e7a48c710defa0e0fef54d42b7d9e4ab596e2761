ASoC: fsl_esai: Fix TDM slot setup for I2S mode

When using the driver in I2S TDM mode, the fsl_esai_startup()
function rewrites the number of slots previously set by the
fsl_esai_set_dai_tdm_slot() function to 2.
To fix this, let's use the saved slot count value or, if TDM
is not used and the number of slots is not set, the driver will use
the default value (2), which is set by fsl_esai_probe().
