virt: acrn: Introduce EPT mapping management

The HSM provides hypervisor services to the ACRN userspace. While
launching a User VM, ACRN userspace needs to allocate memory and request
the ACRN Hypervisor to set up the EPT mapping for the VM.

A mapping cache is introduced for accelerating the translation between
the Service VM kernel virtual address and User VM physical address.

>From the perspective of the hypervisor, the types of GPA of User VM can be
listed as following:
   1) RAM region, which is used by User VM as system ram.
   2) MMIO region, which is recognized by User VM as MMIO. MMIO region is
      used to be utilized for devices emulation.

Generally, User VM RAM regions mapping is set up before VM started and
is released in the User VM destruction. MMIO regions mapping may be set
and unset dynamically during User VM running.

To achieve this, ioctls ACRN_IOCTL_SET_MEMSEG and ACRN_IOCTL_UNSET_MEMSEG
are introduced in HSM.
