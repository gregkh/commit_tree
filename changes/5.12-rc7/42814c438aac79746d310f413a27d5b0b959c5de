PCI: mediatek: Add missing of_node_put() to fix reference leak

The for_each_available_child_of_node helper internally makes use of the
of_get_next_available_child() which performs an of_node_get() on each
iteration when searching for next available child node.

Should an available child node be found, then it would return a device
node pointer with reference count incremented, thus early return from
the middle of the loop requires an explicit of_node_put() to prevent
reference count leak.

To stop the reference leak, explicitly call of_node_put() before
returning after an error occurred.
