powerpc/pkeys: Remove unused code

This removes arch_supports_pkeys(), arch_usable_pkeys() and
thread_pkey_regs_*() which are remnants from the following:

commit 06bb53b33804 ("powerpc: store and restore the pkey state across context switches")
commit 2cd4bd192ee9 ("powerpc/pkeys: Fix handling of pkey state across fork()")
commit cf43d3b26452 ("powerpc: Enable pkey subsystem")

arch_supports_pkeys() and arch_usable_pkeys() were unused
since their introduction while thread_pkey_regs_*() became
unused after the introduction of the following:

commit d5fa30e6993f ("powerpc/book3s64/pkeys: Reset userspace AMR correctly on exec")
commit 48a8ab4eeb82 ("powerpc/book3s64/pkeys: Don't update SPRN_AMR when in kernel mode")
