bpf: link: Refuse non-O_RDWR flags in BPF_OBJ_GET

Invoking BPF_OBJ_GET on a pinned bpf_link checks the path access
permissions based on file_flags, but the returned fd ignores flags.
This means that any user can acquire a "read-write" fd for a pinned
link with mode 0664 by invoking BPF_OBJ_GET with BPF_F_RDONLY in
file_flags. The fd can be used to invoke BPF_LINK_DETACH, etc.

Fix this by refusing non-O_RDWR flags in BPF_OBJ_GET. This works
because OBJ_GET by default returns a read write mapping and libbpf
doesn't expose a way to override this behaviour for programs
and links.
