mac80211: fix rate mask reset

Coverity reported the strange "if (~...)" condition that's
always true. It suggested that ! was intended instead of ~,
but upon further analysis I'm convinced that what really was
intended was a comparison to 0xff/0xffff (in HT/VHT cases
respectively), since this indicates that all of the rates
are enabled.

Change the comparison accordingly.

I'm guessing this never really mattered because a reset to
not having a rate mask is basically equivalent to having a
mask that enables all rates.
