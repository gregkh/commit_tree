cifs: escape spaces in share names

Commit 653a5efb849a ("cifs: update super_operations to show_devname")
introduced the display of devname for cifs mounts. However, when mounting
a share which has a whitespace in the name, that exact share name is also
displayed in mountinfo. Make sure that all whitespace is escaped.
