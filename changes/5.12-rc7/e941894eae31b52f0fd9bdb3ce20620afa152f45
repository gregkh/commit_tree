io-wq: make buffered file write hashed work map per-ctx

Before the io-wq thread change, we maintained a hash work map and lock
per-node per-ring. That wasn't ideal, as we really wanted it to be per
ring. But now that we have per-task workers, the hash map ends up being
just per-task. That'll work just fine for the normal case of having
one task use a ring, but if you share the ring between tasks, then it's
considerably worse than it was before.

Make the hash map per ctx instead, which provides full per-ctx buffered
write serialization on hashed writes.
