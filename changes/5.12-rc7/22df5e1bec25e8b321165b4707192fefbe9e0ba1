ath10k: pass the ssid info to get the correct bss entity

When connect to an AP with WPA mode, ath10k need to set need_ptk_4_way to
firmware in WMI_PEER_ASSOC_CMD, then the data path is disallow in
firmware, it will be allowed untill firmware finish the 4 way handshake.

It failed with a test case with below steps:
1. configure AP with WPA mode with ssid1 SimpleConnect_a_orbvt_ch1,
   bssid1 and channel 1.
2. connect to ssid1 and ping success.
3. wait 10 seconds which is less than
   IEEE80211_SCAN_RESULT_EXPIRE(30 seconds).
4. configure AP with OPEN mode with ssid2 SimpleConnect_b_z3a00_ch1,
   but use same bssid1 and channel 1 of step 1.
5. disconnect ssid1.
6. connect to ssid2 and ping fail.

Fail reason:
When run step 6, ath10k_peer_assoc_h_crypto() called cfg80211_get_bss()
with bssid and chan info, but ssid1 and ssid2 have the same bssid and
channel, then there have 2 entry for ssid1 and ssid2 in cfg80211. The
ssid1's order is before ssid2 in bss_list, and ssid1's age is less than
the expire time which is IEEE80211_SCAN_RESULT_EXPIRE(30 seconds). Then
ssid1's entry is selected and ath10k_peer_assoc_h_crypto() parsed it and
get the rsnie and then need_ptk_4_way is set to firmware, so data path
is disallowed and it will not receive 4 way handshake for OPEN mode,
so ping fail in step 6.

This patch is to pass the ssid info to cfg80211_get_bss() as same as
cfg80211_mlme_assoc() and cfg80211_mlme_auth(), then it will find the
correct bss entry in above test case, then case success.

For AP mode, the ssid info is filled in ieee80211_start_ap(), for STATION
mode, it is filled in ieee80211_mgd_assoc(). Tested for both AP/STATION
mode with QCA6174 hw3.2 PCI, it is success start/connect/ping for
WPA/OPEN mode.

Tested-on: QCA6174 hw3.2 PCI WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00110-QCARMSWP-1
