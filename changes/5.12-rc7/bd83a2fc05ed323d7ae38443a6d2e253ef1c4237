brcmfmac: p2p: Fix recently introduced deadlock issue

Commit a05829a7222e ("cfg80211: avoid holding the RTNL when calling the
driver") replaced the rtnl_lock parameter passed to various brcmf
functions with just lock, because since that commit it is not just
about the rtnl_lock but also about the wiphy_lock .

During this search/replace the "if (!rtnl_locked)" check in brcmfmac/p2p.c
was accidentally replaced with "if (locked)", dropping the inversion of
the check. This causes the code to now call rtnl_lock() while already
holding the lock, causing a deadlock.

Add back the "!" to the if-condition to fix this.
