igc: Fix igc_ptp_rx_pktstamp()

The comment describing the timestamps layout in the packet buffer is
wrong and the code is actually retrieving the timestamp in Timer 1
reference instead of Timer 0. This hasn't been a big issue so far
because hardware is configured to report both timestamps using Timer 0
(see IGC_SRRCTL register configuration in igc_ptp_enable_rx_timestamp()
helper). This patch fixes the comment and the code so we retrieve the
timestamp in Timer 0 reference as expected.

This patch also takes the opportunity to get rid of the hw.mac.type check
since it is not required.
