powerpc64/idle: Fix SP offsets when saving GPRs

The idle entry/exit code saves/restores GPRs in the stack "red zone"
(Protected Zone according to PowerPC64 ELF ABI v2). However, the offset
used for the first GPR is incorrect and overwrites the back chain - the
Protected Zone actually starts below the current SP. In practice this is
probably not an issue, but it's still incorrect so fix it.

Also expand the comments to explain why using the stack "red zone"
instead of creating a new stackframe is appropriate here.
