include/linux/sched/mm.h: use rcu_dereference in in_vfork()

Fix a sparse warning by using rcu_dereference().  Technically this is a
bug and a sufficiently aggressive compiler could reload the `real_parent'
pointer outside the protection of the rcu lock (and access freed memory),
but I think it's pretty unlikely to happen.
