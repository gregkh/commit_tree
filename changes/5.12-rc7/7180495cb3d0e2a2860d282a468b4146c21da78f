USB: cdc-acm: fix double free on probe failure

If tty-device registration fails the driver copy of any Country
Selection functional descriptor would end up being freed twice; first
explicitly in the error path and then again in the tty-port destructor.

Drop the first erroneous free that was left when fixing a tty-port
resource leak.
