video: hyperv_fb: Fix a double free in hvfb_probe

Function hvfb_probe() calls hvfb_getmem(), expecting upon return that
info->apertures is either NULL or points to memory that should be freed
by framebuffer_release().  But hvfb_getmem() is freeing the memory and
leaving the pointer non-NULL, resulting in a double free if an error
occurs or later if hvfb_remove() is called.

Fix this by removing all kfree(info->apertures) calls in hvfb_getmem().
This will allow framebuffer_release() to free the memory, which follows
the pattern of other fbdev drivers.
