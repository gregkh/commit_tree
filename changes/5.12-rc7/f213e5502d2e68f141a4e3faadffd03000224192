s390/smp: smp_emergency_stop() - move cpumask away from stack

Make "cpumask_t cpumask" a static variable to avoid a potential large
stack frame. Also protect against potential concurrent callers by
introducing a local lock.
Note: smp_emergency_stop() gets only called with irqs and machine
checks disabled, therefore a cpu local deadlock is not possible. For
concurrent callers the first cpu which enters the critical section
wins and will stop all other cpus.
