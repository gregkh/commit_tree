tty: implement read_iter

Now that the ldisc read() function takes kernel pointers, it's fairly
straightforward to make the tty file operations use .read_iter() instead
of .read().

That automatically gives us vread() and friends, and also makes it
possible to do .splice_read() on ttys again.

Fixes: 36e2c7421f02 ("fs: don't allow splice read/write without explicit ops")
