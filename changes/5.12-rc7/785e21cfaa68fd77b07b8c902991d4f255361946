i2c: core: Do not print duplicate error when failing to register an i2c-client from ACPI

i2c_new_client_device() already prints an error when it fails. Some
ACPI tables contain 2 ACPI devices describing the same i2c-client,
leading to errors like this:

[    1.620847] i2c i2c-4: Failed to register i2c client MAGN0001:00 at 0x1d (-16)
[    1.620870] i2c i2c-4: failed to add I2C device MAGN0001:00 from ACPI

There is nothing we can do about the first -EBUSY error being logged,
but the second error does not really add any new information, so lets
drop it.
