can: mcp251x: fix support for half duplex SPI host controllers

Some SPI host controllers do not support full-duplex SPI transfers.

The function mcp251x_spi_trans() does a full duplex transfer. It is
used in several places in the driver, where a TX half duplex transfer
is sufficient.

To fix support for half duplex SPI host controllers, this patch
introduces a new function mcp251x_spi_write() and changes all callers
that do a TX half duplex transfer to use mcp251x_spi_write().
