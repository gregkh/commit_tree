kunit: add kunit.filter_glob cmdline option to filter suites

E.g. specifying this would run suites with "list" in their name.
  kunit.filter_glob=list*

Note: the executor prints out a TAP header that includes the number of
suites we intend to run.
So unless we want to report empty results for filtered-out suites, we
need to do the filtering here in the executor.
It's also probably better in the executor since we most likely don't
want any filtering to apply to tests built as modules.

This code does add a CONFIG_GLOB=y dependency for CONFIG_KUNIT=y.
But the code seems light enough that it shouldn't be an issue.

For now, we only filter on suite names so we don't have to create copies
of the suites themselves, just the array (of arrays) holding them.

The name is rather generic since in the future, we could consider
extending it to a syntax like:
  kunit.filter_glob=<suite_glob>.<test_glob>
E.g. to run all the del list tests
  kunit.filter_glob=list-kunit-test.*del*

But at the moment, it's far easier to manually comment out test cases in
test files as opposed to messing with sets of Kconfig entries to select
specific suites.
So even just doing this makes using kunit far less annoying.
