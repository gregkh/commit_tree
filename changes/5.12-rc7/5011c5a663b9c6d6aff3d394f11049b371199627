btrfs: validate qgroup inherit for SNAP_CREATE_V2 ioctl

The problem is we're copying "inherit" from user space but we don't
necessarily know that we're copying enough data for a 64 byte
struct.  Then the next problem is that 'inherit' has a variable size
array at the end, and we have to verify that array is the size we
expected.
