Revert "drm/amd/display: Fixed Intermittent blue screen on OLED panel"

commit a861736dae64 ("drm/amd/display: Fixed Intermittent blue screen on OLED panel")

causes power regression for many users. It seems that this change causes
the MCLK to get forced high; this creates a regression for many users
since their devices were not able to drop to a low state after this
change. For this reason, this reverts commit
a861736dae644a0d7abbca0c638ae6aad28feeb8.
