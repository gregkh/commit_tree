platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: DYTC Platform profile support

Add support to ideapad-laptop for Lenovo platforms that have DYTC
version 5 support or newer to use the platform profile feature.

Mostly based on Mark Pearson <markpearson@lenovo.com>'s thinkpad-acpi
work but massaged to fit ideapad driver.

Note that different from ThinkPads, IdeaPads's Thermal Hotkey won't
trigger profile switch itself, we'll leave it for userspace programs.

Tested on Lenovo Yoga-14S ARE Chinese Edition.
