dt-bindings: display: Use OF graph schema

Now that we have a graph schema, rework the display related schemas to use
it. Mostly this is adding a reference to graph.yaml and dropping duplicate
parts from schemas.

In panel-common.yaml, 'ports' is dropped. Any binding using 'ports'
should be one with more than 1 port node, and the binding must define
what each port is.

Note that ti,sn65dsi86.yaml, ti,tfp410,yaml and toshiba,tc358768.yaml will
need further updates to use video-interfaces.yaml once that lands.
