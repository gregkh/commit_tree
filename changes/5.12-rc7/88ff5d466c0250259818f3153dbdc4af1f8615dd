cxl/mem: Fix potential memory leak

When submitting a command for userspace, input and output payload bounce
buffers are allocated. For a given command, both input and output
buffers may exist and so when allocation of the input buffer fails, the
output buffer must be freed too.

As far as I can tell, userspace can't easily exploit the leak to OOM a
machine unless the machine was already near OOM state.
