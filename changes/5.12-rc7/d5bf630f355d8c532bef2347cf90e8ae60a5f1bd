gfs2: bypass signal_our_withdraw if no journal

Before this patch, function signal_our_withdraw referenced the journal
inode immediately. But corrupt file systems may have some invalid
journals, in which case our attempt to read it in will withdraw and the
resulting signal_our_withdraw would dereference the NULL value.

This patch adds a check to signal_our_withdraw so that if the journal
has not yet been initialized, it simply returns and does the old-style
withdraw.

Thanks, Andy Price, for his analysis.
