lockdep: Add a missing initialization hint to the "INFO: Trying to register non-static key" message

Since this message is printed when dynamically allocated spinlocks (e.g.
kzalloc()) are used without initialization (e.g. spin_lock_init()),
suggest to developers to check whether initialization functions for objects
were called, before making developers wonder what annotation is missing.

[ mingo: Minor tweaks to the message. ]
