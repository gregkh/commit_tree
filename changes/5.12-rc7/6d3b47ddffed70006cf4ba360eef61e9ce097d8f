x86/resctrl: Apply READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE to task_struct.{rmid,closid}

A CPU's current task can have its {closid, rmid} fields read locally
while they are being concurrently written to from another CPU.
This can happen anytime __resctrl_sched_in() races with either
__rdtgroup_move_task() or rdt_move_group_tasks().

Prevent load / store tearing for those accesses by giving them the
READ_ONCE() / WRITE_ONCE() treatment.
