esp: delete NETIF_F_SCTP_CRC bit from features for esp offload

Now in esp4/6_gso_segment(), before calling inner proto .gso_segment,
NETIF_F_CSUM_MASK bits are deleted, as HW won't be able to do the
csum for inner proto due to the packet encrypted already.

So the UDP/TCP packet has to do the checksum on its own .gso_segment.
But SCTP is using CRC checksum, and for that NETIF_F_SCTP_CRC should
be deleted to make SCTP do the csum in own .gso_segment as well.

In Xiumei's testing with SCTP over IPsec/veth, the packets are kept
dropping due to the wrong CRC checksum.
