doc: Use CONFIG_PREEMPTION

CONFIG_PREEMPTION is selected by CONFIG_PREEMPT and by CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT.
Both PREEMPT and PREEMPT_RT require the same functionality which today
depends on CONFIG_PREEMPT.

Update the documents and mention CONFIG_PREEMPTION. Spell out
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT (instead PREEMPT_RT) since it is an option now.
