arm64: kernel: disable CNP on Carmel

On NVIDIA Carmel cores, CNP behaves differently than it does on standard
ARM cores. On Carmel, if two cores have CNP enabled and share an L2 TLB
entry created by core0 for a specific ASID, a non-shareable TLBI from
core1 may still see the shared entry. On standard ARM cores, that TLBI
will invalidate the shared entry as well.

This causes issues with patchsets that attempt to do local TLBIs based
on cpumasks instead of broadcast TLBIs. Avoid these issues by disabling
CNP support for NVIDIA Carmel cores.
