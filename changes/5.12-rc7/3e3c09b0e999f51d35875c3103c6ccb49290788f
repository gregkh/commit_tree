bnxt_en: Move reading VPD info after successful handshake with fw.

If firmware is in reset or in bad state, it won't be able to return
VPD data.  Move bnxt_vpd_read_info() until after bnxt_fw_init_one_p1()
successfully returns.  By then we would have established proper
communications with the firmware.
