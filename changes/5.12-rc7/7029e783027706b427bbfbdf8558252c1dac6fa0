remoteproc: qcom: pil_info: avoid 64-bit division

On 32-bit machines with 64-bit resource_size_t, the driver causes
a link failure because of the 64-bit division:

arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: drivers/remoteproc/qcom_pil_info.o: in function `qcom_pil_info_store':
qcom_pil_info.c:(.text+0x1ec): undefined reference to `__aeabi_uldivmod'

Add a cast to an u32 to avoid this. If the resource exceeds 4GB,
there are bigger problems.
