memory: ti-aemif: Drop child node when jumping out loop

Call of_node_put() to decrement the reference count of the child node
child_np when jumping out of the loop body of
for_each_available_child_of_node(), which is a macro that increments and
decrements the reference count of child node. If the loop is broken, the
reference of the child node should be dropped manually.
