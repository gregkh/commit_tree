platform/surface: aggregator: Add event item allocation caching

Event items are used for completing Surface Aggregator EC events, i.e.
placing event command data and payload on a workqueue for later
processing to avoid doing said processing directly on the receiver
thread. This means that event items are allocated for each incoming
event, regardless of that event being transmitted via sequenced or
unsequenced packets.

On the Surface Book 3 and Surface Laptop 3, touchpad HID input events
(unsequenced), can constitute a larger amount of traffic, and therefore
allocation of event items. This warrants caching event items to reduce
memory fragmentation. The size of the cached objects is specifically
tuned to accommodate keyboard and touchpad input events and their
payloads on those devices. As a result, this effectively also covers
most other event types. In case of a larger event payload, event item
allocation will fall back to kzalloc().
