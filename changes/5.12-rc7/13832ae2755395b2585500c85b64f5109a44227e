mptcp: fix ADD_ADDR HMAC in case port is specified

Currently, Linux computes the HMAC contained in ADD_ADDR sub-option using
the Address Id and the IP Address, and hardcodes a destination port equal
to zero. This is not ok for ADD_ADDR with port: ensure to account for the
endpoint port when computing the HMAC, in compliance with RFC8684 ยง3.4.1.
