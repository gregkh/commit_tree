net: hns3: fix bug when calculating the TCAM table info

The function hclge_fd_convert_tuple() is used to convert tuples
and tuples mask to TCAM x and y.  But it misuses the source mac
as source mac mask when convert INNER_SRC_MAC, which may cause
the flow director rule works unexpectedly. So fix it.
