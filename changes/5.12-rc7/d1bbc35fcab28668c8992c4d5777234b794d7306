arm64: hibernate: add __force attribute to gfp_t casting

Two new warnings are reported by sparse:

"sparse warnings: (new ones prefixed by >>)"
>> arch/arm64/kernel/hibernate.c:181:39: sparse: sparse: cast to
   restricted gfp_t
>> arch/arm64/kernel/hibernate.c:202:44: sparse: sparse: cast from
   restricted gfp_t

gfp_t has __bitwise type attribute and requires __force added to casting
in order to avoid these warnings.
