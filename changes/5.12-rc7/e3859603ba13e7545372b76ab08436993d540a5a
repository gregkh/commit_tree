mptcp: better msk receive window updates

Move mptcp_cleanup_rbuf() related checks inside the mentioned
helper and extend them to mirror TCP checks more closely.

Additionally drop the 'rmem_pending' hack, since commit 879526030c8b
("mptcp: protect the rx path with the msk socket spinlock") we
can use instead 'rmem_released'.
