iwlwifi: pnvm: increment the pointer before checking the TLV

If the SKU_ID doesn't match, we don't increment the pointer and keep
checking the same TLV over and over again.

We need to increment the pointer in all situtations, namely if the TLV
is not a SKU_ID, if the SKU_ID matched or if the SKU_ID didn't match.
So we can increment the pointer already before checking for these
conditions to solve the problem.
