ocfs2: fix deadlock between setattr and dio_end_io_write

The following deadlock is detected:

  truncate -> setattr path is waiting for pending direct IO to be done (inode->i_dio_count become zero) with inode->i_rwsem held (down_write).

  PID: 14827  TASK: ffff881686a9af80  CPU: 20  COMMAND: "ora_p005_hrltd9"
   #0  __schedule at ffffffff818667cc
   #1  schedule at ffffffff81866de6
   #2  inode_dio_wait at ffffffff812a2d04
   #3  ocfs2_setattr at ffffffffc05f322e [ocfs2]
   #4  notify_change at ffffffff812a5a09
   #5  do_truncate at ffffffff812808f5
   #6  do_sys_ftruncate.constprop.18 at ffffffff81280cf2
   #7  sys_ftruncate at ffffffff81280d8e
   #8  do_syscall_64 at ffffffff81003949
   #9  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe at ffffffff81a001ad

dio completion path is going to complete one direct IO (decrement
inode->i_dio_count), but before that it hung at locking inode->i_rwsem:

   #0  __schedule+700 at ffffffff818667cc
   #1  schedule+54 at ffffffff81866de6
   #2  rwsem_down_write_failed+536 at ffffffff8186aa28
   #3  call_rwsem_down_write_failed+23 at ffffffff8185a1b7

   #5  ocfs2_dio_end_io_write+180 at ffffffffc05d5444 [ocfs2]
   #6  ocfs2_dio_end_io+85 at ffffffffc05d5a85 [ocfs2]
   #7  dio_complete+140 at ffffffff812c873c
   #8  dio_aio_complete_work+25 at ffffffff812c89f9
   #9  process_one_work+361 at ffffffff810b1889
  #10  worker_thread+77 at ffffffff810b233d
  #11  kthread+261 at ffffffff810b7fd5
  #12  ret_from_fork+62 at ffffffff81a0035e

Thus above forms ABBA deadlock.  The same deadlock was mentioned in
upstream commit 28f5a8a7c033 ("ocfs2: should wait dio before inode lock
in ocfs2_setattr()").  It seems that that commit only removed the
cluster lock (the victim of above dead lock) from the ABBA deadlock
party.

End-user visible effects: Process hang in truncate -> ocfs2_setattr path
and other processes hang at ocfs2_dio_end_io_write path.

This is to fix the deadlock itself.  It removes inode_lock() call from
dio completion path to remove the deadlock and add ip_alloc_sem lock in
setattr path to synchronize the inode modifications.
