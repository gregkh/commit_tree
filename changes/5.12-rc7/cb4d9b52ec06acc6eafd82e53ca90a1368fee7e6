usb: dwc3: drd: Improve dwc3_get_extcon() style

The previous change ("usb: dwc3: drd: Avoid error when extcon is
missing") changed the code flow in dwc3_get_extcon() function, leading
to unnecessary if-branch. This patch does housekeeping by reworking the
code for obtaining an extcon device from the "port" node.
