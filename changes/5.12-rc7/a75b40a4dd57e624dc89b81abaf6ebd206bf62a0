selftests: kvm: Properly set Hyper-V CPUIDs in evmcs_test

Generally, when Hyper-V emulation is enabled, VMM is supposed to set
Hyper-V CPUID identifications so the guest knows that Hyper-V features
are available. evmcs_test doesn't currently do that but so far Hyper-V
emulation in KVM was enabled unconditionally. As we are about to change
that, proper Hyper-V CPUID identification should be set in selftests as
well.
