ALSA: usb-audio: Fix unintentional sign extension issue

The shifting of the u8 integer device by 24 bits to the left will
be promoted to a 32 bit signed int and then sign-extended to a
64 bit unsigned long. In the event that the top bit of device is
set then all then all the upper 32 bits of the unsigned long will
end up as also being set because of the sign-extension. Fix this
by casting device to an unsigned long before the shift.
