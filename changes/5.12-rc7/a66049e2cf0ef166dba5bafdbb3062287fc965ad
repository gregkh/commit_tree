Kbuild: make DWARF version a choice

Adds a default CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF_TOOLCHAIN_DEFAULT which allows
the implicit default version of DWARF emitted by the toolchain to
progress over time.

Modifies CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF4 to be a member of a choice, making it
mutually exclusive with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF_TOOLCHAIN_DEFAULT. Users
may want to select this if they are using a newer toolchain, but have
consumers of the DWARF debug info that aren't yet ready for newer DWARF
versions' debug info.

Does so in a way that's forward compatible with existing
configs, and makes adding future versions more straightforward. This
patch does not change the current behavior or selection of DWARF
version for users upgrading to kernels with this patch.

GCC since ~4.8 has defaulted to DWARF v4 implicitly, and GCC 11 has
bumped this to v5.

Remove the Kconfig help text  about DWARF v4 being larger.  It's
empirically false for the latest toolchains for x86_64 defconfig, has no
point of reference (I suspect it was DWARF v2 but that's stil
empirically false), and debug info size is not a qualatative measure.
