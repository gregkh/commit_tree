iwlwifi: acpi: don't return valid pointer as an ERR_PTR

iwl_acpi_get_wifi_pkg() may return a valid pointer (meaning success),
while `tbl_rev` is invalid (equel to 1).
In this case, we will treat that as an error.
Subsequent "users" of this "error code" may either check for nonzero
(good; pointers are never zero) or negative
(bad; pointers may be "positive") fix that by splitting the if statement.
First check if IS_ERR(wifi_pkg) and then if tbl_rev != 0.
