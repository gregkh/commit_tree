ALSA: hda: intel-nhlt: verify config type

Multiple bug reports report issues with the SOF and SST drivers when
dealing with single microphone cases.

We currently read the DMIC array information unconditionally but we
don't check that the configuration type is actually a mic array.

When the DMIC link does not rely on a mic array configuration, the
recommendation is to check the format information to infer the maximum
number of channels, and map this to the number of microphones.

This leaves a potential for a mismatch between actual microphones
available in hardware and what the ACPI table contains, but we have no
other source of information.

Note that single microphone configurations can alternatively be
handled with a 'mic array' configuration along with a 'vendor-defined'
geometry.
