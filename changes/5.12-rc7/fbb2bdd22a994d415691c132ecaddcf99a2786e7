drm/i915/gvt: fix uninitialized return in intel_gvt_update_reg_whitelist()

Smatch found an uninitialized variable bug in this code:

    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gvt/cmd_parser.c:3191 intel_gvt_update_reg_whitelist()
    error: uninitialized symbol 'ret'.

The first thing that Smatch complains about is that "ret" isn't set if
we don't enter the "for_each_engine(engine, &dev_priv->gt, id) {" loop.
Presumably we always have at least one engine so that's a false
positive.

But it's definitely a bug to not set "ret" if i915_gem_object_pin_map()
fails.

Let's fix the bug and silence the false positive.
