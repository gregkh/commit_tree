bcm63xx_enet: convert to build_skb

We can increase the efficiency of rx path by using buffers to receive
packets then build SKBs around them just before passing into the network
stack. In contrast, preallocating SKBs too early reduces CPU cache
efficiency.

Check if we're in NAPI context when refilling RX. Normally we're almost
always running in NAPI context. Dispatch to napi_alloc_frag directly
instead of relying on netdev_alloc_frag which does the same but
with the overhead of local_bh_disable/enable.

Tested on BCM6328 320 MHz and iperf3 -M 512 to measure packet/sec
performance. Included netif_receive_skb_list and NET_IP_ALIGN
optimizations.

Before:
[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth       Retr
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec  49.9 MBytes  41.9 Mbits/sec  197         sender
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec  49.3 MBytes  41.3 Mbits/sec            receiver

After:
[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth       Retr
[  4]   0.00-30.00  sec   171 MBytes  47.8 Mbits/sec  272         sender
[  4]   0.00-30.00  sec   170 MBytes  47.6 Mbits/sec            receiver
