usb: musb: Fix suspend with devices connected for a64

Pinephone running on Allwinner A64 fails to suspend with USB devices
connected as reported by Bhushan Shah <bshah@kde.org>. Reverting
commit 5fbf7a253470 ("usb: musb: fix idling for suspend after
disconnect interrupt") fixes the issue.

Let's add suspend checks also for suspend after disconnect interrupt
quirk handling like we already do elsewhere.
