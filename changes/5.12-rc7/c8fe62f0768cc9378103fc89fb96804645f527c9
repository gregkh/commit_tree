mptcp: reset 'first' and ack_hint on subflow close

Just like with last_snd, we have to NULL 'first' on subflow close.

ack_hint isn't strictly required (its never dereferenced), but better to
clear this explicitly as well instead of making it an exception.

msk->first is dereferenced unconditionally at accept time, but
at that point the ssk is not on the conn_list yet -- this means
worker can't see it when iterating the conn_list.
