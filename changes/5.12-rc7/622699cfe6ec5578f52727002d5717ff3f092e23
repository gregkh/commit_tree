fs-verity: support reading Merkle tree with ioctl

Add support for FS_VERITY_METADATA_TYPE_MERKLE_TREE to
FS_IOC_READ_VERITY_METADATA.  This allows a userspace server program to
retrieve the Merkle tree of a verity file for serving to a client which
implements fs-verity compatible verification.  See the patch which
introduced FS_IOC_READ_VERITY_METADATA for more details.

This has been tested using a new xfstest which calls this ioctl via a
new subcommand for the 'fsverity' program from fsverity-utils.
