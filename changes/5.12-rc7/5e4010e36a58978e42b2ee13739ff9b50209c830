usb: dwc3: qcom: skip interconnect init for ACPI probe

The ACPI probe starts failing since commit bea46b981515 ("usb: dwc3:
qcom: Add interconnect support in dwc3 driver"), because there is no
interconnect support for ACPI, and of_icc_get() call in
dwc3_qcom_interconnect_init() will just return -EINVAL.

Fix the problem by skipping interconnect init for ACPI probe, and then
the NULL icc_path_ddr will simply just scheild all ICC calls.
