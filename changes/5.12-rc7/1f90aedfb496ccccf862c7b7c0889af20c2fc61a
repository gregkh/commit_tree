net/mlx5: Delete auxiliary bus driver eth-rep first

Delete auxiliary bus drivers flow deletes the eth driver
first and then the eth-reps driver but eth-reps devices resources
are depend on eth device.

Fixed by changing the delete order of auxiliary bus drivers to delete
the eth-rep driver first and after it the eth driver.
