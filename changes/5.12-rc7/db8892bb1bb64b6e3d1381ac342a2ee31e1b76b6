usb: cdns3: Add support for DRD CDNSP

Patch adds support for Cadence DRD Super Speed Plus controller(CDNSP).
CDNSP DRD is a part of Cadence CDNSP controller.
The DRD CDNSP controller has a lot of difference on hardware level but on
software level is quite compatible with CDNS3 DRD. For this reason
CDNS3 DRD part of CDNS3 driver was reused for CDNSP driver.
