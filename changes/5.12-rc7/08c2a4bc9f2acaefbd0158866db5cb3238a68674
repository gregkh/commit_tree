ALSA: hda: move Intel SoundWire ACPI scan to dedicated module

The ACPI scan capabilities is called from the intel-dspconfig as well
as the SOF/HDaudio drivers. This creates dependencies and randconfig issues
when HDaudio and SOF/SoundWire are not all configured as modules.

To simplify Kconfig dependencies between HDAudio, SoundWire, SOF and
intel-dspconfig, move the ACPI scan helpers to a dedicated
module. This follows the same idea as NHLT helpers which are already
handled as a dedicated module.

The only functional change is that the kernel parameter to filter
links is now handled by a different module, but that was only provided
for developers needing work-arounds for early BIOS releases.
