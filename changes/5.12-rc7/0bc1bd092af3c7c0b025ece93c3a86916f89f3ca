tty_port: drop last traces of low_latency

The main purpose of tty_port::low_latency was removed in commit
a9c3f68f3cd8 (tty: Fix low_latency BUG) back in 2014. It was left in
place for drivers as an optional tune knob. But only one driver has been
using it until the previous commit. So remove this misconcept
completely, given there are no users.
