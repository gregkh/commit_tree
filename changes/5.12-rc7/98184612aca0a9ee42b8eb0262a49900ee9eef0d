net: udp: Add support for getsockopt(..., ..., UDP_GRO, ..., ...);

Support for UDP_GRO was added in the past but the implementation for
getsockopt was missed which did lead to an error when we tried to
retrieve the setting for UDP_GRO. This patch adds the missing switch
case for UDP_GRO

Fixes: e20cf8d3f1f7 ("udp: implement GRO for plain UDP sockets.")
