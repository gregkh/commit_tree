i2c: iproc: handle rx fifo full interrupt

Add code to handle IS_S_RX_FIFO_FULL_SHIFT interrupt to support
master write request with >= 64 bytes.

Iproc has a slave rx fifo size of 64 bytes.
Rx fifo full interrupt (IS_S_RX_FIFO_FULL_SHIFT) will be generated
when RX fifo becomes full. This can happen if master issues write
request of more than 64 bytes.
