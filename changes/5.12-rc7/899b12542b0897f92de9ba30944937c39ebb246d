ASoC: rt711: add snd_soc_component remove callback

We do some IO operations in the snd_soc_component_set_jack callback
function and snd_soc_component_set_jack() will be called when soc
component is removed. However, we should not access SoundWire registers
when the bus is suspended.
So set regcache_cache_only(regmap, true) to avoid accessing in the
soc component removal process.
