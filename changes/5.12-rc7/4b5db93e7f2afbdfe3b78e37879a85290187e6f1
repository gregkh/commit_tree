nfc: Avoid endless loops caused by repeated llcp_sock_connect()

When sock_wait_state() returns -EINPROGRESS, "sk->sk_state" is
 LLCP_CONNECTING. In this case, llcp_sock_connect() is repeatedly invoked,
 nfc_llcp_sock_link() will add sk to local->connecting_sockets twice.
 sk->sk_node->next will point to itself, that will make an endless loop
 and hang-up the system.
To fix it, check whether sk->sk_state is LLCP_CONNECTING in
 llcp_sock_connect() to avoid repeated invoking.
