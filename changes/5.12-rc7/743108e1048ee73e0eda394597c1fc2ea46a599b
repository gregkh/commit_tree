tools headers: Update syscall.tbl files to support mount_setattr

To pick the changes from:

  9caccd41541a6f7d ("fs: introduce MOUNT_ATTR_IDMAP")

This adds this new syscall to the tables used by tools such as 'perf
trace', so that one can specify it by name and have it filtered, etc.

Addressing these perf build warnings:
