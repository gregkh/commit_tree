net/mlx5: E-switch, Create vport miss group only if src rewrite is supported

Create send to vport miss group was added in order to support traffic
recirculation to root table with metadata source rewrite.
This group is created also in case source rewrite isn't supported.

Fixed by creating send to vport miss group only if source rewrite is
supported by FW.
