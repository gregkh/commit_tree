xfrm: Fix NULL pointer dereference on policy lookup

When xfrm interfaces are used in combination with namespaces
and ESP offload, we get a dst_entry NULL pointer dereference.
This is because we don't have a dst_entry attached in the ESP
offloading case and we need to do a policy lookup before the
namespace transition.

Fix this by expicit checking of skb_dst(skb) before accessing it.
