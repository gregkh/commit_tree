scsi: hisi_sas: Remove deferred probe check in hisi_sas_v2_probe()

The platform_get_irq() check for -EPROBE_DEFER was to ensure that all the
steps to add the SCSI host are not done and then only to realise that the
probe needs to be deferred.

However, since there is now an earlier check for this in
hisi_sas_interrupt_preinit(), this check is superfluous and may be removed.
