RDMA/rxe: Correct skb on loopback path

rxe_net.c sends packets at the IP layer with skb->data pointing at the IP
header but receives packets from a UDP tunnel with skb->data pointing at
the UDP header.  On the loopback path this was not correctly accounted
for.  This patch corrects for this by using sbk_pull() to strip the IP
header from the skb on received packets.
