io_uring: save atomic dec for inline executed reqs

When a request is completed with comp_state, its completion reference
put is deferred to io_submit_flush_completions(), but the submission
is put not far from there, so do it together to save one atomic dec per
request. That targets requests that complete inline, e.g. buffered rw,
send/recv.

Proper benchmarking haven't been conducted but for nops(batch=32) it was
around 7901 vs 8117 KIOPS (~2.7%), or ~4% per perf profiling.
