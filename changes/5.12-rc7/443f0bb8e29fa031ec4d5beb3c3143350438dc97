Revert "ARM: dts: bcm2711: Add the BSC interrupt controller"

As Dave reported:

This seems to have unintended side effects.  GIC interrupt 117 is shared
between the standard I2C controllers (i2c-bcm2835) and the l2-intc block
handling the HDMI I2C interrupts.

There is not a great way to share an interrupt between an interrupt
controller using the chained IRQ handler which is an interrupt flow and
another driver like i2c-bcm2835 which uses an interrupt handler
(although it specifies IRQF_SHARED).

Simply revert this change for now which will mean that HDMI I2C will be
polled, like it was before.
