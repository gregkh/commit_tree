clk: qcom: camcc: Update the clock ops for the SC7180

Some of the RCGs could be always ON from the XO source and could be used
as the clock on signal for the GDSC to be operational. In the cases where
the GDSCs are parked at different source with the source clock disabled,
it could lead to the GDSC to be stuck at ON/OFF during gdsc disable/enable.
Thus park the RCGs at XO during clock disable and update the rcg_ops to
use the shared_ops.
