staging: vc4_services: bcm2835-audio: Add SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH flag

Playing audio with PulseAudio and the bcm2835-pcm driver results
in distorted sound. Timer-based scheduling does not properly work
with bcm2835-pcm since configuring PulseAudio with tsched=0
avoids this problem.

Setting the SNDRV_PCM_INFO_BATCH flag prevents PulseAudio to use
timer-based scheduling by default. Settings this flag makes audio
works out of the box.
