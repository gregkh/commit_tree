vhost scsi: alloc vhost_scsi with kvzalloc() to avoid delay

The size of 'struct vhost_scsi' is order-10 (~2.3MB). It may take long time
delay by kzalloc() to compact memory pages by retrying multiple times when
there is a lack of high-order pages. As a result, there is latency to
create a VM (with vhost-scsi) or to hotadd vhost-scsi-based storage.

The prior commit 595cb754983d ("vhost/scsi: use vmalloc for order-10
allocation") prefers to fallback only when really needed, while this patch
allocates with kvzalloc() with __GFP_NORETRY implicitly set to avoid
retrying memory pages compact for multiple times.

The __GFP_NORETRY is implicitly set if the size to allocate is more than
PAGE_SZIE and when __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL is not explicitly set.
