ALSA: pcm: Assure sync with the pending stop operation at suspend

The current PCM code calls the sync_stop at the resume action due to
the analogy to the PCM prepare call pattern.  But, it makes little
sense, as the sync should have been done rather at the suspend time,
not at the resume time.

This patch corrects the sync_stop call at suspend/resume to assure the
sync before finishing the suspend.
