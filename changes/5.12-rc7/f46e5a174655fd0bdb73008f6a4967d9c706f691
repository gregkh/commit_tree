xfs: fold sbcount quiesce logging into log covering

xfs_log_sbcount() calls xfs_sync_sb() to sync superblock counters to
disk when lazy superblock accounting is enabled. This occurs on
unmount, freeze, and read-only (re)mount and ensures the final
values are calculated and persisted to disk before each form of
quiesce completes.

Now that log covering occurs in all of these contexts and uses the
same xfs_sync_sb() mechanism to update log state, there is no need
to log the superblock separately for any reason. Update the log
quiesce path to sync the superblock at least once for any mount
where lazy superblock accounting is enabled. If the log is already
covered, it will remain in the covered state. Otherwise, the next
sync as part of the normal covering sequence will carry the
associated superblock update with it. Remove xfs_log_sbcount() now
that it is no longer needed.
