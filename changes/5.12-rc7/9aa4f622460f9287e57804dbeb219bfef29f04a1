KVM: vmx/pmu: Release guest LBR event via lazy release mechanism

The vPMU uses GUEST_LBR_IN_USE_IDX (bit 58) in 'pmu->pmc_in_use' to
indicate whether a guest LBR event is still needed by the vcpu. If the
vcpu no longer accesses LBR related registers within a scheduling time
slice, and the enable bit of LBR has been unset, vPMU will treat the
guest LBR event as a bland event of a vPMC counter and release it
as usual. Also, the pass-through state of LBR records msrs is cancelled.
