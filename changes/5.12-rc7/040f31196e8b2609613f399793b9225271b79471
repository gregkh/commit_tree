soc/fsl: qbman: fix conflicting alignment attributes

When building with W=1, gcc points out that the __packed attribute
on struct qm_eqcr_entry conflicts with the 8-byte alignment
attribute on struct qm_fd inside it:

drivers/soc/fsl/qbman/qman.c:189:1: error: alignment 1 of 'struct qm_eqcr_entry' is less than 8 [-Werror=packed-not-aligned]

I assume that the alignment attribute is the correct one, and
that qm_eqcr_entry cannot actually be unaligned in memory,
so add the same alignment on the outer struct.
