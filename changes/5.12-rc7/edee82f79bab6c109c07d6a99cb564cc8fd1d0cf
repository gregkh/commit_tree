mmc: sdhci-pci-gli: Enlarge ASPM L1 entry delay of GL9763E

GL9763E enters ASPM L1 state after a very short idle in default,
even during a burst of request. So the R/W performance of GL9763E
is low with some platforms, which support ASPM mechanism, due to
entering ASPM L1 state very frequently in R/W process. Set the L1
entry delay bits in vendor-specific register to 0x3FF to enlarge
the idle period to 260us for improving the R/W performance
of GL9763E.
