io_uring: move reissue into regular IO path

It's non-obvious how retry is done for block backed files, when it happens
off the kiocb done path. It also makes it tricky to deal with the iov_iter
handling.

Just mark the req as needing a reissue, and handling it from the
submission path instead. This makes it directly obvious that we're not
re-importing the iovec from userspace past the submit point, and it means
that we can just reuse our usual -EAGAIN retry path from the read/write
handling.

At some point in the future, we'll gain the ability to always reliably
return -EAGAIN through the stack. A previous attempt on the block side
didn't pan out and got reverted, hence the need to check for this
information out-of-band right now.
