Drivers: hv: vmbus: Resolve race condition in vmbus_onoffer_rescind()

An erroneous or malicious host could send multiple rescind messages for
a same channel.  In vmbus_onoffer_rescind(), the guest maps the channel
ID to obtain a pointer to the channel object and it eventually releases
such object and associated data.  The host could time rescind messages
and lead to an use-after-free.  Add a new flag to the channel structure
to make sure that only one instance of vmbus_onoffer_rescind() can get
the reference to the channel object.
