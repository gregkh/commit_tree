btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

Often an fsync needs to fallback to a transaction commit for several
reasons (to ensure consistency after a power failure, a new block group
was allocated or a temporary error such as ENOMEM or ENOSPC happened).

In that case the log is marked as needing a full commit and any concurrent
tasks attempting to log inodes or commit the log will also fallback to the
transaction commit. When this happens they all wait for the task that first
started the transaction commit to finish the transaction commit - however
they wait until the full transaction commit happens, which is not needed,
as they only need to wait for the superblocks to be persisted and not for
unpinning all the extents pinned during the transaction's lifetime, which
even for short lived transactions can be a few thousand and take some
significant amount of time to complete - for dbench workloads I have
observed up to 4~5 milliseconds of time spent unpinning extents in the
worst cases, and the number of pinned extents was between 2 to 3 thousand.

So allow fsync tasks to skip waiting for the unpinning of extents when
they call btrfs_commit_transaction() and they were not the task that
started the transaction commit (that one has to do it, the alternative
would be to offload the transaction commit to another task so that it
could avoid waiting for the extent unpinning or offload the extent
unpinning to another task).

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update when deleting dir entry
  btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for logging
  btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
  btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when logging all parents
  btrfs: skip logging inodes already logged when logging new entries
  btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()
  btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

After applying the entire patchset, dbench shows improvements in respect
to throughput and latency. The script used to measure it is the following:

  $ cat dbench-test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdk
  MNT=/mnt/sdk
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"
  MKFS_OPTIONS="-m single -d single"

  echo "performance" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  umount $DEV &> /dev/null
  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  dbench -D $MNT -t 300 64

  umount $MNT

The test was run on a physical machine with 12 cores (Intel corei7), 64G
of ram, using a NVMe device and a non-debug kernel configuration (Debian's
default configuration).
