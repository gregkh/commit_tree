net: dsa: remove the transactional logic from MDB entries

For many drivers, the .port_mdb_prepare callback was not a good opportunity
to avoid any error condition, and they would suppress errors found during
the actual commit phase.

Where a logical separation between the prepare and the commit phase
existed, the function that used to implement the .port_mdb_prepare
callback still exists, but now it is called directly from .port_mdb_add,
which was modified to return an int code.
