ice: Cleanup fltr list in case of allocation issues

When ice_remove_vsi_lkup_fltr is called, by calling
ice_add_to_vsi_fltr_list local copy of vsi filter list
is created. If any issues during creation of vsi filter
list occurs it up for the caller to free already
allocated memory. This patch ensures proper memory
deallocation in these cases.
