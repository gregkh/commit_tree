powerpc: Fix build error in paravirt.h

./arch/powerpc/include/asm/paravirt.h:83:44: error: implicit declaration
of function 'smp_processor_id'; did you mean 'raw_smp_processor_id'?

smp_processor_id is defined in linux/smp.h but it is not included.

The build error happens only when the patch is applied to 5.3 kernel but
it only works by chance in mainline.
