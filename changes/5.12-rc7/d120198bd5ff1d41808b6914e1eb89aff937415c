xen/evtchn: Change irq_info lock to raw_spinlock_t

Unmask operation must be called with interrupt disabled,
on preempt_rt spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_irqrestore
don't disable/enable interrupts, so use raw_* implementation
and change lock variable in struct irq_info from spinlock_t
to raw_spinlock_t
