ALSA: usb-audio: Convert remaining strlcpy() to strscpy()

USB-audio driver still contains two calls of strlcpy() because the
return size is evaluated.  Basically it just checks whether the string
is copied or not, but since strcpy() may return a negative error code,
we should check the negative value and treat as filled.
