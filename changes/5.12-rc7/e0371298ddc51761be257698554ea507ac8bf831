i2c: i2c-qcom-geni: Add shutdown callback for i2c

If the hardware is still accessing memory after SMMU translation
is disabled (as part of smmu shutdown callback), then the
IOVAs (I/O virtual address) which it was using will go on the bus
as the physical addresses which will result in unknown crashes
like NoC/interconnect errors.

So, implement shutdown callback to i2c driver to stop on-going transfer
and unmap DMA mappings during system "reboot" or "shutdown".
