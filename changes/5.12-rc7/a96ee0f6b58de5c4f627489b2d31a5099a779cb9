drm: panel: simple: Add BOE NV110WTM-N61

Add support for the BOE NV110WTM-N61 panel.  The EDID lists two modes
(one for 60 Hz refresh rate and one for 40 Hz), so we'll list both of
them here.

Note that the panel datasheet requires 80 ms between HPD asserting and
the backlight power being turned on.  We'll use the new timing
constraints structure to do this cleanly.  This assumes that the
backlight will be enabled _after_ the panel enable finishes.  This is
how it works today and seems a sane assumption.
