btrfs: zoned: enable relocation on a zoned filesystem

Currently fallocate() is disabled on a zoned filesystem. Since current
relocation process relies on preallocation to move file data extents, it
must be handled differently.

On a zoned filesystem, we just truncate the inode to the size that we
wanted to pre-allocate. Then, we flush dirty pages on the file before
finishing the relocation process. run_delalloc_zoned() will handle all
the allocations and submit IOs to the underlying layers.
