RDMA/rxe: Fix errant WARN_ONCE in rxe_completer()

In rxe_comp.c in rxe_completer() the function free_pkt() did not clear skb
which triggered a warning at 'done:' and could possibly at 'exit:'. The
WARN_ONCE() calls are not actually needed.  The call to free_pkt() is
moved to the end to clearly show that all skbs are freed.
