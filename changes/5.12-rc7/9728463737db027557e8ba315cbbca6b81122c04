io_uring: fix rw req completion

WARNING: at fs/io_uring.c:8578 io_ring_exit_work.cold+0x0/0x18

As reissuing is now passed back by REQ_F_REISSUE and kiocb_done()
internally uses __io_complete_rw(), it may stop after setting the flag
so leaving a dangling request.

There are tricky edge cases, e.g. reading beyound file, boundary, so
the easiest way is to hand code reissue in kiocb_done() as
__io_complete_rw() was doing for us before.

Fixes: 230d50d448ac ("io_uring: move reissue into regular IO path")
