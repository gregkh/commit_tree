ASoC: tegra: ahub: Add missing resets

AHUB driver misses D_AUDIO and APBIF resets. CPU hangs on trying to
access hardware if resets aren't de-asserted. This problem is currently
masked by the tegra-clk driver which implicitly de-asserts the resets when
the corresponding clocks are enabled. Soon the implicit de-assertion will
be gone from the tegra-clk driver, thus we need to fix the AHUB driver.
Add the missing resets to the driver.
