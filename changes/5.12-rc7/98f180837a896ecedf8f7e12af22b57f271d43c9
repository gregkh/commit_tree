mm: Make mem_dump_obj() handle vmalloc() memory

This commit adds vmalloc() support to mem_dump_obj().  Note that the
vmalloc_dump_obj() function combines the checking and dumping, in
contrast with the split between kmem_valid_obj() and kmem_dump_obj().
The reason for the difference is that the checking in the vmalloc()
case involves acquiring a global lock, and redundant acquisitions of
global locks should be avoided, even on not-so-fast paths.

Note that this change causes on-stack variables to be reported as
vmalloc() storage from kernel_clone() or similar, depending on the degree
of inlining that your compiler does.  This is likely more helpful than
the earlier "non-paged (local) memory".
