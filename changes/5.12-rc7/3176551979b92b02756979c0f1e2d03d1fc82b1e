ice: Use port number instead of PF ID for WoL

As per the spec, the WoL control word read from the NVM should be
interpreted as port numbers, and not PF numbers. So when checking
if WoL supported, use the port number instead of the PF ID.

Also, ice_is_wol_supported doesn't really need a pointer to the pf
struct, but just needs a pointer to the hw instance.
