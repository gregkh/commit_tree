scsi: core: No retries on abort success

Add a new optional routine, eh_should_retry_cmd(), in scsi_host_template
that allows the transport to decide if a cmd is retryable. Return true if
the transport is in a state the cmd should be retried on.

Update scmd_eh_abort_handler() and scsi_eh_flush_done_q() to both call
scsi_eh_should_retry_cmd() to check whether the command needs to be
retried.

The above changes were based on a patch by Mike Christie.
