USB: serial: xr: fix pin configuration

Make sure that the modem pins are set up correctly when opening the
port to avoid leaving, for example, DTR and RTS configured as inputs,
which is the device default.

This is specifically needed to be able to control DTR and RTS when
hardware flow control is disabled.
