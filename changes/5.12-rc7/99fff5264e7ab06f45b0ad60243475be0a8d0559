wireguard: device: do not generate ICMP for non-IP packets

If skb->protocol doesn't match the actual skb->data header, it's
probably not a good idea to pass it off to icmp{,v6}_ndo_send, which is
expecting to reply to a valid IP packet. So this commit has that early
mismatch case jump to a later error label.
