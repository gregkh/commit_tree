bus: omap_l3_noc: mark l3 irqs as IRQF_NO_THREAD

The main purpose of l3 IRQs is to catch OCP bus access errors and identify
corresponding code places by showing call stack, so it's important to
handle L3 interconnect errors as fast as possible. On RT these IRQs will
became threaded and will be scheduled much more late from the moment actual
error occurred so showing completely useless information.

Hence, mark l3 IRQs as IRQF_NO_THREAD so they will not be forced threaded
on RT or if force_irqthreads = true.
