KVM: x86/mmu: Split out max mapping level calculation to helper

Factor out the logic for determining the maximum mapping level given a
memslot and a gpa.  The helper will be used when zapping collapsible
SPTEs when disabling dirty logging, e.g. to avoid zapping SPTEs that
can't possibly be rebuilt as hugepages.

No functional change intended.
