io_uring: allow IO worker threads to be frozen

With the freezer using the proper signaling to notify us of when it's
time to freeze a thread, we can re-enable normal freezer usage for the
IO threads. Ensure that SQPOLL, io-wq, and the io-wq manager call
try_to_freeze() appropriately, and remove the default setting of
PF_NOFREEZE from create_io_thread().
