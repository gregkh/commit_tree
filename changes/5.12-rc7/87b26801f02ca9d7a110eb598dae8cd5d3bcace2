KVM: arm64: Simplify __kvm_hyp_init HVC detection

The arguments for __do_hyp_init are now passed with a pointer to a
struct which means there are scratch registers available for use. Thanks
to this, we no longer need to use clever, but hard to read, tricks that
avoid the need for scratch registers when checking for the
__kvm_hyp_init HVC.
