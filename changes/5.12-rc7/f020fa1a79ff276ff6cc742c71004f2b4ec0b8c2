i40e: consolidate handling of XDP program actions

Consolidate the actions performed on the packet based on the XDP
program result into a separate function that is easier to read and
maintain. Simplify the i40e_construct_skb_zc function, so that the
input xdp buffer is always freed, regardless of whether the output
skb is successfully created or not. Simplify the behavior of the
i40e_clean_rx_irq_zc function, so that the current packet descriptor
is dropped when function i40_construct_skb_zc returns an error as
opposed to re-processing the same description on the next invocation.
