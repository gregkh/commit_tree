drm/i915/gt: Cancel the preemption timeout on responding to it

We currently presume that the engine reset is successful, cancelling the
expired preemption timer in the process. However, engine resets can
fail, leaving the timeout still pending and we will then respond to the
timeout again next time the tasklet fires. What we want is for the
failed engine reset to be promoted to a full device reset, which is
kicked by the heartbeat once the engine stops processing events.
