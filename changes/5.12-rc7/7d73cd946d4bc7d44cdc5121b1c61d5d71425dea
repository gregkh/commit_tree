mac80211: fix time-is-after bug in mlme

The incorrect timeout check caused probing to happen when it did
not need to happen.  This in turn caused tx performance drop
for around 5 seconds in ath10k-ct driver.  Possibly that tx drop
is due to a secondary issue, but fixing the probe to not happen
when traffic is running fixes the symptom.
