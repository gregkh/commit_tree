ARM: dts: rockchip: Remove bogus "amba" bus nodes

The "amba" bus nodes wrapping all the DMA-330 nodes serve no useful
purpose, and certainly bear no relation at all to the actual underlying
interconnect topology. They appear to be cargo-cult copying from a
design misstep in the very early days of FDT adoption on ARM, which was
righted with the "arm,primecell" compatible, and the last trace of the
idea finally purged by commit 2ef7d5f342c1 ("ARM, ARM64: dts: drop
"arm,amba-bus" in favor of "simple-bus"").

As such, they can simply be removed and the DMA-330 nodes fitted into
the normal sort order.
