zsmalloc: account the number of compacted pages correctly

There exists multiple path may do zram compaction concurrently.
1. auto-compaction triggered during memory reclaim
2. userspace utils write zram<id>/compaction node

So, multiple threads may call zs_shrinker_scan/zs_compact concurrently.
But pages_compacted is a per zsmalloc pool variable and modification
of the variable is not serialized(through under class->lock).
There are two issues here:
1. the pages_compacted may not equal to total number of pages
freed(due to concurrently add).
2. zs_shrinker_scan may not return the correct number of pages
freed(issued by current shrinker).

The fix is simple:
1. account the number of pages freed in zs_compact locally.
2. use actomic variable pages_compacted to accumulate total number.
