pinctrl: qcom: lpass lpi: use default pullup/strength values

If these fields are not set in dts, the driver will use these variables
uninitialized to set the fields. Not only will it set garbage values for
these fields, but it can overflow into other fields and break those.

In the current sm8250 dts, the dmic01 entries do not have a pullup setting,
and might not work without this change.
