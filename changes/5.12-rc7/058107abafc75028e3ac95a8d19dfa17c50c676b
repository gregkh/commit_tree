samples/bpf: Add include dir for MIPS Loongson64 to fix build errors

There exists many build errors when make M=samples/bpf on the Loongson
platform. This issue is MIPS related, x86 compiles just fine.

Here are some errors:

$ find arch/mips/include/asm -name spaces.h | sort

In the arch/mips/Makefile, there exists the following board-dependent
options:

include arch/mips/Kbuild.platforms
cflags-y += -I$(srctree)/arch/mips/include/asm/mach-generic

So we can do the similar things in samples/bpf/Makefile, just add
platform specific and generic include dir for MIPS Loongson64 to
fix the build errors.
