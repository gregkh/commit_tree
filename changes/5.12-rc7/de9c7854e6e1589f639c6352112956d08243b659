net: axienet: allow setups without MDIO

In setups with fixed-link settings there is no mdio node in DTS.
axienet_probe() already handles that gracefully but lp->mii_bus is
then NULL.

Fix code that tries to blindly grab the MDIO lock by introducing two helper
functions that make the locking conditional.
