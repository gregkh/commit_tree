ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix speaker amp setup on Acer Aspire E1

We've got a report about Acer Aspire E1 (PCI SSID 1025:0840) that
loses the speaker output after resume.  With the comparison of COEF
dumps, it was identified that the COEF 0x0d bits 0x6000 corresponds to
the speaker amp.

This patch adds the specific quirk for the device to restore the COEF
bits at the codec (re-)initialization.
