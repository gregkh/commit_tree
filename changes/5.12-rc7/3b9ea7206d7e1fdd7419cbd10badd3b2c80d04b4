ath9k: fix transmitting to stations in dynamic SMPS mode

When transmitting to a receiver in dynamic SMPS mode, all transmissions that
use multiple spatial streams need to be sent using CTS-to-self or RTS/CTS to
give the receiver's extra chains some time to wake up.
This fixes the tx rate getting stuck at <= MCS7 for some clients, especially
Intel ones, which make aggressive use of SMPS.
