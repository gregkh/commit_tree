igc: reinit_locked() should be called with rtnl_lock

This commit applies to the igc_reset_task the same changes that
were applied to the igb driver in commit 024a8168b749 ("igb:
reinit_locked() should be called with rtnl_lock")
and fix possible race in reset subtask.

Fixes: 0507ef8a0372 ("igc: Add transmit and receive fastpath and interrupt handlers")
