parisc: avoid a warning on u8 cast for cmpxchg on u8 pointers

commit b344d6a83d01 ("parisc: add support for cmpxchg on u8 pointers")
can generate a sparse warning ("cast truncates bits from constant
value"), which has been reported several times [1] [2] [3].

The original code worked as expected, but anyway, let silence such
sparse warning as what others did [4].
