btrfs: ref-verify: make sure owner is set for all refs

I noticed that shared ref entries in ref-verify didn't have the proper
owner set, which caused me to think there was something seriously wrong.
However the problem is if we have a parent we simply weren't filling out
the owner part of the reference, even though we have it.

Fix this by making sure we set all the proper fields when we modify a
reference, this way we'll have the proper owner if a problem happens and
we don't waste time thinking we're updating the wrong level.
