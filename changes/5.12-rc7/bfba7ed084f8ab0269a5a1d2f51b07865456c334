rcu-tasks: Add RCU-tasks self tests

This commit adds self tests for early-boot use of RCU-tasks grace periods.
It tests all three variants (Rude, Tasks, and Tasks Trace) and covers
both synchronous (e.g., synchronize_rcu_tasks()) and asynchronous (e.g.,
call_rcu_tasks()) grace-period APIs.

Self-tests are run only in kernels built with CONFIG_PROVE_RCU=y.
