mm/swap.c: don't pass "enum lru_list" to del_page_from_lru_list()

The parameter is redundant in the sense that it can be potentially
extracted from the "struct page" parameter by page_lru(). We need to
make sure that existing PageActive() or PageUnevictable() remains
until the function returns. A few places don't conform, and simple
reordering fixes them.

This patch may have left page_off_lru() seemingly odd, and we'll take
care of it in the next patch.
