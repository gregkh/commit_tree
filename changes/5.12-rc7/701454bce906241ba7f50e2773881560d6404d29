auxdisplay: Remove in_interrupt() usage.

charlcd_write() is invoked as a VFS->write() callback and as such it is
always invoked from preemptible context and may sleep.

charlcd_puts() is invoked from register/unregister callback which is
preemptible. The reboot notifier callback is also invoked from
preemptible context.

Therefore there is no need to use in_interrupt() to figure out if it
is safe to sleep because it always is. in_interrupt() and related
context checks are being removed from non-core code.
Using schedule() to schedule (and be friendly to others) is
discouraged and cond_resched() should be used instead.

Remove in_interrupt() and use cond_resched() to schedule every 32
iterations if needed.
