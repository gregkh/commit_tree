rcu/segcblist: Add counters to segcblist datastructure

Add counting of segment lengths of segmented callback list.

This will be useful for a number of things such as knowing how big the
ready-to-execute segment have gotten. The immediate benefit is ability
to trace how the callbacks in the segmented callback list change.

Also this patch remove hacks related to using donecbs's ->len field as a
temporary variable to save the segmented callback list's length. This cannot be
done anymore and is not needed.

Also fix SRCU:
The negative counting of the unsegmented list cannot be used to adjust
the segmented one. To fix this, sample the unsegmented length in
advance, and use it after CB execution to adjust the segmented list's
length.
