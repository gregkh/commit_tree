block, bfq: fix switch back from soft-rt weitgh-raising

A bfq_queue may happen to be deemed as soft real-time while it is
still enjoying interactive weight-raising. If this happens because of
a false positive, then the bfq_queue is likely to loose its soft
real-time status soon. Upon losing such a status, the bfq_queue must
get back its interactive weight-raising, if its interactive period is
not over yet. But this case is not handled. This commit corrects this
error.
