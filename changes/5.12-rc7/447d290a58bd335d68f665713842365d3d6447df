net: dsa: move switchdev event implementation under the same switch/case statement

We'll need to start listening to SWITCHDEV_FDB_{ADD,DEL}_TO_DEVICE
events even for interfaces where dsa_slave_dev_check returns false, so
we need that check inside the switch-case statement for SWITCHDEV_FDB_*.

This movement also avoids a useless allocation / free of switchdev_work
on the untreated "default event" case.
