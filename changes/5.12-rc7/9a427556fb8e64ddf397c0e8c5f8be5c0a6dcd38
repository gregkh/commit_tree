vmlinux.lds.h: catch compound literals into data and BSS

When building kernel with LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION, LLVM stack
generates separate sections for compound literals, just like in case
with enabled LTO [0]:

ld.lld: warning: drivers/built-in.a(mtd/nand/spi/gigadevice.o):
(.data..compoundliteral.14) is being placed in
'.data..compoundliteral.14'
ld.lld: warning: drivers/built-in.a(mtd/nand/spi/gigadevice.o):
(.data..compoundliteral.15) is being placed in
'.data..compoundliteral.15'
ld.lld: warning: drivers/built-in.a(mtd/nand/spi/gigadevice.o):
(.data..compoundliteral.16) is being placed in
'.data..compoundliteral.16'
ld.lld: warning: drivers/built-in.a(mtd/nand/spi/gigadevice.o):
(.data..compoundliteral.17) is being placed in
'.data..compoundliteral.17'

[...]

Handle this by adding the related sections to generic definitions
as suggested by Sami [0].
