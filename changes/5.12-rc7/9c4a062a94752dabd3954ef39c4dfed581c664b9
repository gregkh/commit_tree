btrfs: send: remove stale code when checking for shared extents

After commit 040ee6120cb670 ("Btrfs: send, improve clone range") we do not
use anymore the data_offset field of struct backref_ctx, as after that we
do all the necessary checks for the data offset of file extent items at
clone_range(). Since there are no more users of data_offset from that
structure, remove it.
