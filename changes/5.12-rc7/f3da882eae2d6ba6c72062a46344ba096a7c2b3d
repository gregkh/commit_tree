btrfs: zoned: remove outdated WARN_ON in direct IO

In btrfs_submit_direct() there's a WAN_ON_ONCE() that will trigger if
we're submitting a DIO write on a zoned filesystem but are not using
REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND to submit the IO to the block device.

This is a left over from a previous version where btrfs_dio_iomap_begin()
didn't use btrfs_use_zone_append() to check for sequential write only
zones.

It is an oversight from the development phase. In v11 (I think) I've
added 08f455593fff ("btrfs: zoned: cache if block group is on a
sequential zone") and forgot to remove the WARN_ON_ONCE() for
544d24f9de73 ("btrfs: zoned: enable zone append writing for direct IO").

When developing auto relocation I got hit by the WARN as a block groups
where relocated to conventional zone and the dio code calls
btrfs_use_zone_append() introduced by 08f455593fff to check if it can
use zone append (a.k.a. if it's a sequential zone) or not and sets the
appropriate flags for iomap.

I've never hit it in testing before, as I was relying on emulation to
test the conventional zones code but this one case wasn't hit, because
on emulation fs_info->max_zone_append_size is 0 and the WARN doesn't
trigger either.
