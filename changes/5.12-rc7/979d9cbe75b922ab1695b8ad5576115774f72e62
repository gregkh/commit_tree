USB: serial: pl2303: fix line-speed handling on newer chips

The latest chip family (HXN) apparently does not support setting the
line speed using divisors and instead needs to use the direct encoding
scheme for all rates.

This specifically enables 50, 110, 134, 200 bps and other rates not
supported by the original chip type.
