clk: si570: Skip NVM to RAM recall operation if an optional property is set

Recalling NVM data into RAM during probe() initiates a re-calibration of
the clock. If the clock is already in-use, the recall operation can cause
a glitch on the frequency out. At power on, the factory data are loaded
from NVM into RAM by default. If the clock frequency has been changed
since power on, the recall operation can be used to re-initialize the clock
to factory setting.
