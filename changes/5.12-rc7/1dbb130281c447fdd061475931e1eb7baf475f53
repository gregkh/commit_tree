net: dsa: remove the DSA specific notifiers

This effectively reverts commit 60724d4bae14 ("net: dsa: Add support for
DSA specific notifiers"). The reason is that since commit 2f1e8ea726e9
("net: dsa: link interfaces with the DSA master to get rid of lockdep
warnings"), it appears that there is a generic way to achieve the same
purpose. The only user thus far, the Broadcom SYSTEMPORT driver, was
converted to use the generic notifiers.
