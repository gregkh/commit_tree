bpf, selftests: Fold test_current_pid_tgid_new_ns into test_progs.

Currently tests for bpf_get_ns_current_pid_tgid() are outside test_progs.
This change folds test cases into test_progs.

Changes from v11:

 - Fixed test failure is not detected.
 - Removed EXIT(3) call as it will stop test_progs execution.
