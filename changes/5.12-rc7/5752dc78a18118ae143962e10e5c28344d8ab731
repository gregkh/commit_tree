nullb: use blk_queue_set_zoned() to setup zoned devices

Use blk_queue_set_zoned() to set a nullb device zone model instead of
directly assigning the device queue zoned limit. This initialization of
the devicve zoned model as well as the setup of the queue flag
QUEUE_FLAG_ZONE_RESETALL and of the device queue elevator feature are
moved from null_init_zoned_dev() to null_register_zoned_dev() so that
the initialization of the queue limits is done when the gendisk of the
nullb device is available.
