IMA: add support to measure buffer data hash

The original IMA buffer data measurement sizes were small (e.g.  boot
command line), but the new buffer data measurement use cases have data
sizes that are a lot larger.  Just as IMA measures the file data hash,
not the file data, IMA should similarly support the option for measuring
buffer data hash.

Introduce a boolean parameter to support measuring buffer data hash,
which would be much smaller, instead of the buffer itself.
