usbip: stub-dev synchronize sysfs code paths

Fuzzing uncovered race condition between sysfs code paths in usbip
drivers. Device connect/disconnect code paths initiated through
sysfs interface are prone to races if disconnect happens during
connect and vice versa.

Use sysfs_lock to protect sysfs paths in stub-dev.
