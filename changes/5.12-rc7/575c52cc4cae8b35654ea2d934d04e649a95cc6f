media: videobuf2: always call poll_wait() on queues

do_poll()/do_select() seem to set the _qproc member of poll_table to
NULL the first time they are called on a given table, making subsequent
calls of poll_wait() on that table no-ops. This is a problem for vb2
which calls poll_wait() on the V4L2 queues' waitqueues only when a
queue-related event is requested, which may not necessarily be the case
during the first poll.

Fix this by making the call to poll_wait() happen first thing and
unconditionally in vb2_core_poll().
