net: hns3: clear VF down state bit before request link status

Currently, the VF down state bit is cleared after VF sending
link status request command. There is problem that when VF gets
link status replied from PF, the down state bit may still set
as 1. In this case, the link status replied from PF will be
ignored and always set VF link status to down.

To fix this problem, clear VF down state bit before VF requests
link status.
