iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Remove the page 1 fixup

Since we now keep track of page 1 via a separate pointer that already
encapsulates aliasing to page 0 as necessary, we can remove the clunky
fixup routine and simply use the relevant bases directly. The current
architecture spec (IHI0070D.a) defines SMMU_{EVENTQ,PRIQ}_{PROD,CONS} as
offsets relative to page 1, so the cleanup represents a little bit of
convergence as well as just lines of code saved.
