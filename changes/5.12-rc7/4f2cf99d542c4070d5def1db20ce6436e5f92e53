drm/msm/a5xx: Allow all patchid for A540 chip

On at least MSM8998 it's possible to find Adreno 540.0 and 540.1
but I have never found any 540.2. In any case, the patchids 0-1
for A540 are completely supported by this driver and there is no
reason to disallow probing them (as they also share the same
firmware names).

Besides that, the patchid number is also used in the a5xx_power.c
function a540_lm_setup to disable the battery current limiter,
which makes faking the Adreno patchid to .2 (which would anyway
be sad) useless and even producing breakages.
