platform/surface: aggregator: Add control packet allocation caching

Surface Serial Hub communication is, in its core, packet based. Each
sequenced packet requires to be acknowledged, via an ACK-type control
packet. In case invalid data has been received by the driver, a NAK-type
(not-acknowledge/negative acknowledge) control packet is sent,
triggering retransmission.

Control packets are therefore a core communication primitive and used
frequently enough (with every sequenced packet transmission sent by the
embedded controller, including events and request responses) that it may
warrant caching their allocations to reduce possible memory
fragmentation.
