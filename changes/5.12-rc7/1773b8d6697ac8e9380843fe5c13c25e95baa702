arm64: dts: imx8mq-librem5-r3: workaround i2c1 issue with 1GHz cpu voltage

This is a workaround for a hardware bug in the r3 revision that basically would
stop the system due to traffic on the i2c1 bus. A cpu voltage change would
trigger such traffic and that's what is avoided in order to work around it.
