KVM: x86: hyper-v: Track Hyper-V TSC page status

Create an infrastructure for tracking Hyper-V TSC page status, i.e. if it
was updated from guest/host side or if we've failed to set it up (because
e.g. guest wrote some garbage to HV_X64_MSR_REFERENCE_TSC) and there's no
need to retry.

Also, in a hypothetical situation when we are in 'always catchup' mode for
TSC we can now avoid contending 'hv->hv_lock' on every guest enter by
setting the state to HV_TSC_PAGE_BROKEN after compute_tsc_page_parameters()
returns false.

Check for HV_TSC_PAGE_SET state instead of '!hv->tsc_ref.tsc_sequence' in
get_time_ref_counter() to properly handle the situation when we failed to
write the updated TSC page values to the guest.
