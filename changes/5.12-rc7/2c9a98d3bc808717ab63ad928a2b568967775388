preempt/dynamic: Provide preempt_schedule[_notrace]() static calls

Provide static calls to control preempt_schedule[_notrace]()
(called in CONFIG_PREEMPT) so that we can override their behaviour when
preempt= is overriden.

Since the default behaviour is full preemption, both their calls are
initialized to the arch provided wrapper, if any.

[fweisbec: only define static calls when PREEMPT_DYNAMIC, make it less
           dependent on x86 with __preempt_schedule_func]
