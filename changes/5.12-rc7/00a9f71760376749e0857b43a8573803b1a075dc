dt-bindings: phy: phy-stm32-usbphyc: move PLL supplies to parent node

PLL block requires to be powered with 1v1 and 1v8 supplies to catch ENABLE
signal.
Currently, supplies are managed through phy_ops .power_on/off, and PLL
activation/deactivation is managed through phy_ops .init/exit.
The sequence of phy_ops .power_on/.phy_init, .power_off/.exit is USB
drivers dependent.
To ensure a good behavior of the PLL, supplies have to be managed at PLL
activation/deactivation. That means the supplies need to be put in usbphyc
parent node and not in phy children nodes.
