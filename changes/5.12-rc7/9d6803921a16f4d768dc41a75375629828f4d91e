net: hsr: Reset MAC header for Tx path

Reset MAC header in HSR Tx path. This is needed, because direct packet
transmission, e.g. by specifying PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS does not reset the MAC
header.

This has been observed using the following setup:

|$ ip link add name hsr0 type hsr slave1 lan0 slave2 lan1 supervision 45 version 1
|$ ifconfig hsr0 up
|$ ./test hsr0

The test binary is using mmap'ed sockets and is specifying the
PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS socket option.

This patch resolves the following warning on a non-patched kernel:

|[  112.725394] ------------[ cut here ]------------
|[  112.731418] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 257 at net/hsr/hsr_forward.c:560 hsr_forward_skb+0x484/0x568
|[  112.739962] net/hsr/hsr_forward.c:560: Malformed frame (port_src hsr0)

The warning can be safely removed, because the other call sites of
hsr_forward_skb() make sure that the skb is prepared correctly.
