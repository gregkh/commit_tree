[amd64] clean PRSTATUS_SIZE/SET_PR_FPVALID up properly

To get rid of hardcoded size/offset in those macros we need to have
a definition of i386 variant of struct elf_prstatus.  However, we can't
do that in asm/compat.h - the types needed for that are not there and
adding an include of asm/user32.h into asm/compat.h would cause a lot
of mess.

That could be conveniently done in elfcore-compat.h, but currently there
is nowhere to put arch-dependent parts of it - no asm/elfcore-compat.h.
So we introduce a new file (asm/elfcore-compat.h, present on architectures
that have CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_ELFCORE_COMPAT set, currently only on x86),
have it pulled by linux/elfcore-compat.h and move the definitions there.

As a side benefit, we don't need to worry about accidental inclusion of
that file into binfmt_elf.c itself, so we don't need the dance with
COMPAT_PRSTATUS_SIZE, etc. - only fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c will see
that header.
