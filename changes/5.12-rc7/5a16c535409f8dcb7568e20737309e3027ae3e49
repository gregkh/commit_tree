VMCI: Use set_page_dirty_lock() when unregistering guest memory

When the VMCI host support releases guest memory in the case where
the VM was killed, the pinned guest pages aren't locked. Use
set_page_dirty_lock() instead of set_page_dirty().

Testing done: Killed VM while having an active VMCI based vSocket
connection and observed warning from ext4. With this fix, no
warning was observed. Ran various vSocket tests without issues.
