i40e: Fix parameters in aq_get_phy_register()

Change parameters order in aq_get_phy_register() due to wrong
statistics in PHY reported by ethtool. Previously all PHY statistics were
exactly the same for all interfaces
Now statistics are reported correctly - different for different interfaces

Fixes: 0514db37dd78 ("i40e: Extend PHY access with page change flag")
