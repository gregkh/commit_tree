i40e: Fix sparse error: 'vsi->netdev' could be null

Remove vsi->netdev->name from the trace.
This is redundant information. With the devinfo trace, the adapter
is already identifiable.

Previously following error was produced when compiling against sparse.
i40e_main.c:2571 i40e_sync_vsi_filters() error:
	we previously assumed 'vsi->netdev' could be null (see line 2323)

Fixes: b603f9dc20af ("i40e: Log info when PF is entering and leaving Allmulti mode.")
