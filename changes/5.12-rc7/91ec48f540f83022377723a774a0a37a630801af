ASoC: SOF: core: harden shutdown helper

When the probe is handled in a workqueue, we must use
cancel_work_sync() in the shutdown helper to avoid possible race
conditions.

We must also take care of possible errors happening in a probe
workqueue or during pm_runtime resume (called e.g. before shutdown for
PCI devices). We should really only try to access hardware registers
and initiate IPCs if the DSP is fully booted.
