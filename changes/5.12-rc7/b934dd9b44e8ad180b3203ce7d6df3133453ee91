drm/amd/display: fix the return of the uninitialized value in ret

Currently if stream->signal is neither SIGNAL_TYPE_DISPLAY_PORT_MST or
SIGNAL_TYPE_DISPLAY_PORT then variable ret is uninitialized and this is
checked for > 0 at the end of the function.  Ret should be initialized,
I believe setting it to zero is a correct default.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
