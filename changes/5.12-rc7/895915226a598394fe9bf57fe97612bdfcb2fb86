Bluetooth: btusb: Revert Fix the autosuspend enable and disable

drivers/usb/core/hub.c: usb_new_device() contains the following:

        /* By default, forbid autosuspend for all devices.  It will be
         * allowed for hubs during binding.
         */
        usb_disable_autosuspend(udev);

So for anything which is not a hub, such as btusb devices, autosuspend is
disabled by default and we must call usb_enable_autosuspend(udev) to
enable it.

This means that the "Fix the autosuspend enable and disable" commit,
which drops the usb_enable_autosuspend() call when the enable_autosuspend
module option is true, is completely wrong, revert it.

This reverts commit 7bd9fb058d77213130e4b3e594115c028b708e7e.
