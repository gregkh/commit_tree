mac80211: add rx decapsulation offload support

This allows drivers to pass 802.3 frames to mac80211, with some restrictions:

- the skb must be passed with a valid sta
- fast-rx needs to be active for the sta
- monitor mode needs to be disabled

mac80211 will tell the driver when it is safe to enable rx decap offload for
a particular station.

In order to implement support, a driver must:

- call ieee80211_hw_set(hw, SUPPORTS_RX_DECAP_OFFLOAD)
- implement ops->sta_set_decap_offload
- mark 802.3 frames with RX_FLAG_8023

If it doesn't want to enable offload for some vif types, it can mask out
IEEE80211_OFFLOAD_DECAP_ENABLED in vif->offload_flags from within the
.add_interface or .update_vif_offload driver ops
