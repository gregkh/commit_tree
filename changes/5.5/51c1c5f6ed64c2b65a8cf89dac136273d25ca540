scsi: pm80xx: Cleanup command when a reset times out

Added the fix so the if driver properly sent the abort it tries to remove
it from the firmware's list of outstanding commands regardless of the abort
status. This means that the task gets freed 'now' rather than possibly
getting freed later when the scsi layer thinks it's leaked but still valid.
