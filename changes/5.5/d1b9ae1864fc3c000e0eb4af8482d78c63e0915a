s390/qeth: vnicc Fix init to default

During vnicc_init wanted_char should be compared to cur_char and not
to QETH_VNICC_DEFAULT. Without this patch there is no way to enforce
the default values as desired values.

Note, that it is expected, that a card comes online with default values.
This patch was tested with private card firmware.
