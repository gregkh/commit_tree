staging: wfx: allow to send 802.11 frames

Three things make this task more complex than it should:
  - Chip necessitate to associate a link-id to each station. It is same
    thing than association ID but, using 8 bits only.
  - Rate policy is sent separately from Tx frames
  - Driver try to handle itself power saving of stations and multicast
    data
