mmc: dw_mmc: Fix debugfs on 64-bit platforms

"dw_mci.pending_events" and "dw_mci.completed_events" are "unsigned
long", i.e. 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on the platform.  Hence casting
their addresses to "u32 *", and calling debugfs_create_x32() breaks
operation on 64-bit platforms.

Fix this by using the new debugfs_create_xul() helper instead.
