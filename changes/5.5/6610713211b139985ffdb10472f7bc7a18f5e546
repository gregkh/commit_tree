drm/amdgpu/navi10: implement GFXCLK_CURVE overdrive

[Why]
Before this patch, there was no way to set the gfxclk voltage curve in
the overdrive settings for navi10 through pp_od_clk_voltage

[How]
Add the required implementation to navi10's ppt dpm table editing
implementation, similar to the vega20 implementation and interface.
