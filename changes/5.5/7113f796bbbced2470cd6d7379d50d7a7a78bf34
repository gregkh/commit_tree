bnx2x: Do not handle requests from VFs after parity

Parity error from the hardware will cause PF to lose the state
of their VFs due to PF's internal reload and hardware reset following
the parity error. Restrict any configuration request from the VFs after
the parity as it could cause unexpected hardware behavior, only way
for VFs to recover would be to trigger FLR on VFs and reload them.
