cgroup: freezer: don't change task and cgroups status unnecessarily

It's not necessary to adjust the task state and revisit the state
of source and destination cgroups if the cgroups are not in freeze
state and the task itself is not frozen.

And in this scenario, it wakes up the task who's not supposed to be
ready to run.

Don't do the unnecessary task state adjustment can help stop waking
up the task without a reason.
