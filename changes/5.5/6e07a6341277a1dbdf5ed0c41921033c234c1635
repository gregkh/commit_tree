bpf: Switch BPF probe insns to bpf_probe_read_kernel

Commit 2a02759ef5f8 ("bpf: Add support for BTF pointers to interpreter")
explicitly states that the pointer to BTF object is a pointer to a kernel
object or NULL. Therefore we should also switch to using the strict kernel
probe helper which is restricted to kernel addresses only when architectures
have non-overlapping address spaces.
