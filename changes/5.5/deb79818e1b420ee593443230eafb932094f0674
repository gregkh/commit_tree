drm/amd/display: add explicit comparator as default optimization check

[why]
memcmp is vulnerable to regression due to dc_clocks structures not being
organized properly (not "current" clock related structures being at the beginning
of the structure) and causes unnecessary setting of the optimize bit

[how]
add a dcn sepcific comparator, implement for dcn2
