scsi: zfcp: move maximum age of diagnostic buffers into a per-adapter variable

Replace the static define (ZFCP_DIAG_MAX_AGE) with a per-adapter variable
(${adapter}->diagnostics->max_age). This new variable is exported via
sysfs, along with other, already existing adapter variables, and can both
be read and written. This way users can choose how much time should pass
between refreshes of diagnostic buffers. The default value for the age
remains to be five seconds.

By setting this new variable to 0, the caching of diagnostic buffers for
userspace accesses can also be completely removed.

All diagnostic buffers of a given adapter are subject to this setting in
the same way.
