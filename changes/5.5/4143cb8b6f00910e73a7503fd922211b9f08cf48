btrfs: add const function attribute

For some reason the attribute is called __attribute_const__ and not
__const, marks functions that have no observable effects on program
state, IOW not reading pointers, just the arguments and calculating a
value. Allows the compiler to do some optimizations, based on
-Wsuggest-attribute=const . The effects are rather small, though, about
60 bytes decrese of btrfs.ko.
