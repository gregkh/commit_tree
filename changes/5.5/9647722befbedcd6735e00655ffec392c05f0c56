r8152: Add macpassthru support for ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 Dock Gen 2

ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 Dock Gen 2 is another docking station that uses
RTL8153 based USB ethernet.

The device supports macpassthru, but it failed to pass the test of -AD,
-BND and -BD. Simply bypass these tests since the device supports this
feature just fine.

Also the ACPI objects have some differences between Dell's and Lenovo's,
so make those ACPI infos no longer hardcoded.
