net: phy: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier

This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style in
header files related to PHY Layer for Ethernet drivers.
For C header files Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
mandates C-like comments (opposed to C source files where
C++ style should be used). This patch also gives an explicit
block comment to the SPDX License Identifier.
