brcmfmac: add support for SAE authentication offload

The firmware may have SAE authentication code built-in. This is
detected by the driver and indicated in the wiphy features flags.
User-space can use this flag to determine whether or not to provide
the password material for SAE authentication in the nl80211 CONNECT
command.
