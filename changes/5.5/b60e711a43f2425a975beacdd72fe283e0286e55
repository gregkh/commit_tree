drm/doc: Drop misleading comment on drm_mode_config_cleanup

This is not something we'll fix, because failing to clean up stuff (or
doing it in the wrong order) is a driver bug. The offending FIXME goes
all the way back to the original modeset merge.

We've added a WARN_ON in

    drm: reference framebuffers which are on the idr

including a comment blaming drivers on this. Right thing to do is most
likely drm_atomic_helper_shutdown plus making sure that
drm_mode_config_cleanup is not called too early (i.e. not in driver
unload, but only in the final drm_device release callback).
