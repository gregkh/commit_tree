net: hns3: add struct netdev_queue debug info for TX timeout

When there is a TX timeout, we can tell if the driver or stack
has stopped the queue by looking at state field, and when has
the last packet transmited by looking at trans_start field.

So this patch prints these two field in the
hns3_get_tx_timeo_queue_info().
