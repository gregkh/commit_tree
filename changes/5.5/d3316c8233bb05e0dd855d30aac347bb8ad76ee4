btrfs: Properly handle backref_in_log retval

This function can return a negative error value if btrfs_search_slot
errors for whatever reason or if btrfs_alloc_path runs out of memory.
This is currently problemattic because backref_in_log is treated by its
callers as if it returns boolean.

Fix this by adding proper error handling in callers. That also enables
the function to return the direct error code from btrfs_search_slot.
