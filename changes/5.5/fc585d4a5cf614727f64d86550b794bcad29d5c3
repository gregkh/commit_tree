riscv: Less inefficient gcc tishift helpers (and export their symbols)

The existing __lshrti3 was really inefficient, and the other two helpers
are also needed to compile some modules.

Add the missing versions, and export all of the symbols like arm64
already does.

This code is based on the assembly generated by libgcc builds.

This fixes a build break triggered by ubsan:

riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-ld: lib/ubsan.o: in function `.L2':
ubsan.c:(.text.unlikely+0x38): undefined reference to `__ashlti3'
riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-ld: ubsan.c:(.text.unlikely+0x42): undefined reference to `__ashrti3'
