dpaa2-eth: update the TX frame queues on DPNI_IRQ_EVENT_ENDPOINT_CHANGED

Currently the function is called at every link up event, although the
FQID values will only change when the DPNI is disconnected from the
current object and reconnected to a different one.

The patch also avoids the forward declaration of update_tx_fqids.
