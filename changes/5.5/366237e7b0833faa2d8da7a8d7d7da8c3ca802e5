stop_machine: Provide RCU quiescent state in multi_cpu_stop()

When multi_cpu_stop() loops waiting for other tasks, it can trigger an RCU
CPU stall warning.  This can be misleading because what is instead needed
is information on whatever task is blocking multi_cpu_stop().  This commit
therefore inserts an RCU quiescent state into the multi_cpu_stop()
function's waitloop.
