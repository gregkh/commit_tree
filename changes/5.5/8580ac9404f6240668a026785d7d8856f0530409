bpf: Process in-kernel BTF

If in-kernel BTF exists parse it and prepare 'struct btf *btf_vmlinux'
for further use by the verifier.
In-kernel BTF is trusted just like kallsyms and other build artifacts
embedded into vmlinux.
Yet run this BTF image through BTF verifier to make sure
that it is valid and it wasn't mangled during the build.
If in-kernel BTF is incorrect it means either gcc or pahole or kernel
are buggy. In such case disallow loading BPF programs.
