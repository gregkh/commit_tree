powerpc/security: Fix debugfs data leak on 32-bit

"powerpc_security_features" is "unsigned long", i.e. 32-bit or 64-bit,
depending on the platform (PPC_FSL_BOOK3E or PPC_BOOK3S_64).  Hence
casting its address to "u64 *", and calling debugfs_create_x64() is
wrong, and leaks 32-bit of nearby data to userspace on 32-bit platforms.

While all currently defined SEC_FTR_* security feature flags fit in
32-bit, they all have "ULL" suffixes to make them 64-bit constants.
Hence fix the leak by changing the type of "powerpc_security_features"
(and the parameter types of its accessors) to "u64".  This also allows
to drop the cast.
