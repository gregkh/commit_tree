mm: vmscan: replace shrink_node() loop with a retry jump

Most of the function body is inside a loop, which imposes an additional
indentation and scoping level that makes the code a bit hard to follow and
modify.

The looping only happens in case of reclaim-compaction, which isn't the
common case.  So rather than adding yet another function level to the
reclaim path and have every reclaim invocation go through a level that
only exists for one specific cornercase, use a retry goto.
