drm/i915/perf: Set the exclusive stream under perf->lock

The BKL struct_mutex is no more, the only serialisation we required for
setting the exclusive stream is already managed by ce->pin_mutex in
gen8_configure_all_contexts(). As such, we can manipulate
i915_perf.exclusive_stream underneath our own (already held) perf->lock.
