KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Set kvm->arch.xive when VPs are allocated

If we cannot allocate the XIVE VPs in OPAL, the creation of a XIVE or
XICS-on-XIVE device is aborted as expected, but we leave kvm->arch.xive
set forever since the release method isn't called in this case. Any
subsequent tentative to create a XIVE or XICS-on-XIVE for this VM will
thus always fail (DoS). This is a problem for QEMU since it destroys
and re-creates these devices when the VM is reset: the VM would be
restricted to using the much slower emulated XIVE or XICS forever.

As an alternative to adding rollback, do not assign kvm->arch.xive before
making sure the XIVE VPs are allocated in OPAL.
