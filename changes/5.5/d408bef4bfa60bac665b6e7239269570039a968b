tipc: eliminate checking netns if node established

Currently, we scan over all network namespaces at each received
discovery message in order to check if the sending peer might be
present in a host local namespaces.

This is unnecessary since we can assume that a peer will not change its
location during an established session.

We now improve the condition for this testing so that we don't perform
any redundant scans.
