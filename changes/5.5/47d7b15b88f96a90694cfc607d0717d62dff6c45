arm64: cpufeature: introduce helper cpu_has_hw_af()

We unconditionally set the HW_AFDBM capability and only enable it on
CPUs which really have the feature. But sometimes we need to know
whether this cpu has the capability of HW AF. So decouple AF from
DBM by a new helper cpu_has_hw_af().

If later we noticed a potential performance issue on this path, we can
turn it into a static label as with other CPU features.
