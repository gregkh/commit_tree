Drivers: hv: vmbus: Add module parameter to cap the VMBus version

Currently, Linux guests negotiate the VMBus version with Hyper-V
and use the highest available VMBus version they can connect to.
This has some drawbacks: by using the highest available version,
certain code paths are never executed and can not be tested when
the guest runs on the newest host.

Add the module parameter "max_version", to upper-bound the VMBus
versions guests can negotiate.
