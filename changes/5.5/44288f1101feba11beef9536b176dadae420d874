staging: wfx: fix error handling in wfx_tx_get_raw_link_id()

Since wfx_tx_get_raw_link_id() return an unsigned, it makes no sense to
return a negative value. "15" is a better value since it is used by
firmware for stations that have not yet associated link-ids.

Note that this should never happens since driver set max_ap_assoc_sta
to 14.
