HID: quirks: remove hid-led devices from hid_have_special_driver

Since e04a0442d33b ("HID: core: remove the absolute need of
hid_have_special_driver[]") it's no longer needed to list these LED
devices in hid_have_special_driver[]. This allows libraries needing
access to the hidraw device to work properly.
