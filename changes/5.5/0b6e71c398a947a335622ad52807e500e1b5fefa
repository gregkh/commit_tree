selftests/bpf: Teach test_progs to cd into subdir

We are building a bunch of "flavors" of test_progs, e.g., w/ alu32 flag
for Clang when building BPF object. test_progs setup is relying on
having all the BPF object files and extra resources to be available in
current working directory, though. But we actually build all these files
into a separate sub-directory. Next set of patches establishes
convention of naming "flavored" test_progs (and test runner binaries in
general) as test_progs-flavor (e.g., test_progs-alu32), for each such
extra flavor. This patch teaches test_progs binary to automatically
detect its own extra flavor based on its argv[0], and if present, to
change current directory to a flavor-specific subdirectory.
