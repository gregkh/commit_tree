arm64: dts: marvell: Drop PCIe I/O ranges from CP11x file

As an example, Armada 70x0 and 80x0 SoC 0xf9000000 region points to
RUNIT/SPICS0 while it is referenced in the DT as PCIe I/O memory
range. This shows that I/O memory has never been used/working on the
old SoCs despite the region being advertised. As PCIe I/O ranges will
not be supported in newer SoCs using CP11x co-processors, let's
simply drop them. It is not harmful in any case as PCIe device drivers
can do it all with the regular mapped memory anyway.
