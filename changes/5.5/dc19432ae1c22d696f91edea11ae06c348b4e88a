quota: Rename vfs_load_quota_inode() to dquot_load_quota_inode()

Rename vfs_load_quota_inode() to dquot_load_quota_inode() to be
consistent with naming of other functions used for enabling quota
accounting from filesystems. Also export the function and add some
sanity checks to assure filesystems are calling the function properly.
