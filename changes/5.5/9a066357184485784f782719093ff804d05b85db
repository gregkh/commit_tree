kheaders: remove unneeded 'cat' command piped to 'head' / 'tail'

The 'head' and 'tail' commands can take a file path directly.
So, you do not need to run 'cat'.

  cat kernel/kheaders.md5 | head -1

... is equivalent to:

  head -1 kernel/kheaders.md5

and the latter saves forking one process.

While I was here, I replaced 'head -1' with 'head -n 1'.

I also replaced '==' with '=' since we do not have a good reason to
use the bashism.
