iommu/dma: Rationalise types for DMA masks

Since iommu_dma_alloc_iova() combines incoming masks with the u64 bus
limit, it makes more sense to pass them around in their native u64
rather than converting to dma_addr_t early. Do that, and resolve the
remaining type discrepancy against the domain geometry with a cheeky
cast to keep things simple.
