powerpc/powernv: Add queue mechanism for early messages

When issuing a BMC soft poweroff during IPL, the poweroff can be lost
so the machine would not poweroff.

This is because opal messages can be received before the opal-power
code registered its notifiers.

Fix it by buffering messages. If we receive a message and do not yet
have a handler for that type, store the message and replay when a
handler for that type is registered.
