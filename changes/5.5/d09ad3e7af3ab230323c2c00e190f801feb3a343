drm/i915: Unify ICP and MCC hotplug pin tables

The MCC hpd table is just a subset of the ICP table; we can eliminate it
and use the ICP table everywhere.  The extra pins in the table won't be
a problem for MCC since we still supply an appropriate hotplug trigger
mask anywhere the pin table is used.
