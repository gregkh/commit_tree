kdb: Improve handling of characters from different input sources

Currently if an escape timer is interrupted by a character from a
different input source then the new character is discarded and the
function returns '\e' (which will be discarded by the level above).
It is hard to see why this would ever be the desired behaviour.
Fix this to return the new character rather than the '\e'.

This is a bigger refactor than might be expected because the new
character needs to go through escape sequence detection.
