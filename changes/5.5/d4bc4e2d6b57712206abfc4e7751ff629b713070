ice: Disallow VF VLAN opcodes if VLAN offloads disabled

Currently if the host disables VLAN offloads on the VF by
not setting the VIRTCHNL_VF_OFFLOAD_VLAN capability bit
we will still honor VF VLAN configuration messages over
VIRTCHNL. These messages (i.e. enable/disable VLAN stripping
and VLAN filtering) should be blocked when the feature
is not supported. Fix that by adding a helper function to
determine if the VF is allowed to do VLAN operations based
on the host's VF configuration.

Also, mirror the VF communicated capabilities in the host's
VF configuration.
