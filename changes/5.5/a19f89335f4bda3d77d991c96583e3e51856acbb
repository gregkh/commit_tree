watchdog: prevent deferral of watchdogd wakeup on RT

When PREEMPT_RT is enabled, all hrtimer expiry functions are
deferred for execution into the context of ksoftirqd unless otherwise
annotated.

Deferring the expiry of the hrtimer used by the watchdog core, however,
is a waste, as the callback does nothing but queue a kthread work item
and wakeup watchdogd.

It's worst then that, too: the deferral through ksoftirqd also means
that for correct behavior a user must adjust the scheduling parameters
of both watchdogd _and_ ksoftirqd, which is unnecessary and has other
side effects (like causing unrelated expiry functions to execute at
potentially elevated priority).

Instead, mark the hrtimer used by the watchdog core as being _HARD to
allow it's execution directly from hardirq context.  The work done in
this expiry function is well-bounded and minimal.

A user still must adjust the scheduling parameters of the watchdogd
to be correct w.r.t. their application needs.
