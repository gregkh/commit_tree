pktcdvd: fix regression on 64-bit architectures

The support for the compat ioctl did not actually do what it was
supposed to do because of a typo, instead it broke native support for
CDROM_LAST_WRITTEN and CDROM_SEND_PACKET on all architectures with
CONFIG_COMPAT enabled.

Please apply for v5.5, I just noticed the regression while
rebasing some of the patches I created on top.
