PM / devfreq: tegra30: Use kHz units uniformly in the code

Part of the code uses Hz units and the other kHz, let's switch to kHz
everywhere for consistency. A small benefit from this change (besides
code's cleanup) is that now powertop utility correctly displays devfreq's
stats, for some reason it expects them to be in kHz.
