ARM: 8943/1: Fix topology setup in case of CPU hotplug for CONFIG_SCHED_MC

Commit ca74b316df96 ("arm: Use common cpu_topology structure and
functions.") changed cpu_coregroup_mask() from the ARM32 specific
implementation in arch/arm/include/asm/topology.h to the one shared
with ARM64 and RISCV in drivers/base/arch_topology.c.

Currently on ARM32 (TC2 w/ CONFIG_SCHED_MC) the task scheduler setup
code (w/ CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG) shows this during CPU hotplug:

  ERROR: groups don't span domain->span

It happens to CPUs of the cluster of the CPU which gets hot-plugged
out on scheduler domain MC.

Turns out that the shared cpu_coregroup_mask() requires that the
hot-plugged CPU is removed from the core_sibling mask via
remove_cpu_topology(). Otherwise the 'is core_sibling subset of
cpumask_of_node()' doesn't work. In this case the task scheduler has to
deal with cpumask_of_node instead of core_sibling which is wrong on
scheduler domain MC.

e.g. CPU3 hot-plugged out on TC2 [cluster0: 0,3-4 cluster1: 1-2]:

  cpu_coregroup_mask(): CPU3 cpumask_of_node=0-2,4 core_sibling=0,3-4
                                                                  ^
should be:

  cpu_coregroup_mask(): CPU3 cpumask_of_node=0-2,4 core_sibling=0,4

Add remove_cpu_topology() to __cpu_disable() to remove the CPU from the
topology masks in case of a CPU hotplug out operation.

At the same time tweak store_cpu_topology() slightly so it will call
update_siblings_masks() in case of CPU hotplug in operation via
secondary_start_kernel()->smp_store_cpu_info().

This aligns the ARM32 implementation with the ARM64 one.

Guarding remove_cpu_topology() with CONFIG_GENERIC_ARCH_TOPOLOGY is
necessary since some Arm32 defconfigs (aspeed_g5_defconfig,
milbeaut_m10v_defconfig, spear13xx_defconfig) specify an explicit

 # CONFIG_ARM_CPU_TOPOLOGY is not set

w/ ./arch/arm/Kconfig: select GENERIC_ARCH_TOPOLOGY if ARM_CPU_TOPOLOGY
