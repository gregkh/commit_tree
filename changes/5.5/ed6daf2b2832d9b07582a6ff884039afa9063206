staging: axis-fifo: avoid parsing ignored device tree properties

Some properties were parsed from the device tree and then ignored by the
driver. Some would return an error if absent from the device tree, then
return an error if they were found because they are unsupported by the
driver.

Avoid parsing unused properties and clearly explain in the documentation
the ignored / unsupported properties.
