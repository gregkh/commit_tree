mfd: cs5535-mfd: Request shared IO regions centrally

Prior to this patch, IO regions were requested via an MFD subsytem-level
.enable() call-back and similarly released by a .disable() call-back.
Double requests/releases were avoided by a centrally handled usage count
mechanism.

This complexity can all be avoided by handling IO regions only once during
.probe() and .remove() of the parent device.  Since this is the only
legitimate user of the aforementioned usage count mechanism, this patch
will allow it to be removed from MFD core in subsequent steps.
