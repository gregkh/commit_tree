x86/asm: Do not annotate functions with GLOBAL

GLOBAL is an x86's custom macro and is going to die very soon. It was
meant for global symbols, but here, it was used for functions. Instead,
use the new macros SYM_FUNC_START* and SYM_CODE_START* (depending on the
type of the function) which are dedicated to global functions. And since
they both require a closing by SYM_*_END, do that here too.

startup_64, which does not use GLOBAL but uses .globl explicitly, is
converted too.

"No alignments" are preserved.
