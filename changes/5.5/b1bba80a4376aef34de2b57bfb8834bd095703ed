vsock/vmci: register vmci_transport only when VMCI guest/host are active

To allow other transports to be loaded with vmci_transport,
we register the vmci_transport as G2H or H2G only when a VMCI guest
or host is active.

To do that, this patch adds a callback registered in the vmci driver
that will be called when the host or guest becomes active.
This callback will register the vmci_transport in the VSOCK core.
