rcutorture: Make in-kernel-loop testing more brutal

The rcu_torture_fwd_prog_nr() tests the ability of RCU to tolerate
in-kernel busy loops.  It invokes rcu_torture_fwd_prog_cond_resched()
within its delay loop, which, in PREEMPT && NO_HZ_FULL kernels results
in the occasional direct call to schedule().  Now, this direct call to
schedule() is appropriate for call_rcu() flood testing, in which either
the kernel should restrain itself or userspace transitions will supply
the needed restraint.  But in pure in-kernel loops, the occasional
cond_resched() should do the job.

This commit therefore makes rcu_torture_fwd_prog_nr() use cond_resched()
instead of rcu_torture_fwd_prog_cond_resched() in order to increase the
brutality of this aspect of rcutorture testing.
