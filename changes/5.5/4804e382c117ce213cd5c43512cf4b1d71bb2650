x86/ioperm: Share I/O bitmap if identical

The I/O bitmap is duplicated on fork. That's wasting memory and slows down
fork. There is no point to do so. As long as the bitmap is not modified it
can be shared between threads and processes.

Add a refcount and just share it on fork. If a task modifies the bitmap
then it has to do the duplication if and only if it is shared.
