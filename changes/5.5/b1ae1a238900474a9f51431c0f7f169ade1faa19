nvme-fc: Avoid preallocating big SGL for data

nvme_fc_create_io_queues() preallocates a big buffer for the IO SGL based
on SG_CHUNK_SIZE.

Modern DMA engines are often capable of dealing with very big segments so
the SG_CHUNK_SIZE is often too big. SG_CHUNK_SIZE results in a static 4KB
SGL allocation per command.

If a controller has lots of deep queues, preallocation for the sg list can
consume substantial amounts of memory. For nvme-fc, nr_hw_queues can be
128 and each queue's depth 128. This means the resulting preallocation
for the data SGL is 128*128*4K = 64MB per controller.

Switch to runtime allocation for SGL for lists longer than 2 entries. This
is the approach used by NVMe PCI so it should be reasonable for NVMeOF as
well. Runtime SGL allocation has always been the case for the legacy I/O
path so this is nothing new.
