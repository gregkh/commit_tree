ice: Only disable VF state when freeing each VF resources

It is wrong to set PF disable state flag for all VFs when freeing VF
resources - Instead, we should set VF disable state flag for each VF with
its resources being returned to the device. Right now, all VF opcodes,
mailbox communication to clear its resources as well fails - since we
already indicate that PF is in disable state, with all VFs not active. In
addition, we don't need to notify VF that PF is intending to reset it, if
it is already in disabled state.
