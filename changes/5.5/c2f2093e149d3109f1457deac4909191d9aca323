s390/unwind: drop unnecessary code around calling ftrace_graph_ret_addr()

The current code around calling ftrace_graph_ret_addr() is ifdeffed and
also tests if ftrace redirection is present on stack.
ftrace_graph_ret_addr() however performs the test internally and there
is a version for !CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER as well. The unnecessary
code can thus be dropped.
