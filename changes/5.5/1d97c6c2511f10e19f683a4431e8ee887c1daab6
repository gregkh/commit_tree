samples/bpf: Base target programs rules on Makefile.target

The main reason for that - HOSTCC and CC have different aims.
HOSTCC is used to build programs running on host, that can
cross-comple target programs with CC. It was tested for arm and arm64
cross compilation, based on linaro toolchain, but should work for
others.

So, in order to split cross compilation (CC) with host build (HOSTCC),
lets base samples on Makefile.target. It allows to cross-compile
samples/bpf programs with CC while auxialry tools running on host
built with HOSTCC.
