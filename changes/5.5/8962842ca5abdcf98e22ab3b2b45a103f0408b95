blk-mq: avoid sysfs buffer overflow with too many CPU cores

It is reported that sysfs buffer overflow can be triggered if the system
has too many CPU cores(>841 on 4K PAGE_SIZE) when showing CPUs of
hctx via /sys/block/$DEV/mq/$N/cpu_list.

Use snprintf to avoid the potential buffer overflow.

This version doesn't change the attribute format, and simply stops
showing CPU numbers if the buffer is going to overflow.
