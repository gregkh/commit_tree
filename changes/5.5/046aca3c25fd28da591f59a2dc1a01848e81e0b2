cifs: Optimize readdir on reparse points

When listing a directory with thounsands of files and most of them are
reparse points, we simply marked all those dentries for revalidation
and then sending additional (compounded) create/getinfo/close requests
for each of them.

Instead, upon receiving a response from an SMB2_QUERY_DIRECTORY
(FileIdFullDirectoryInformation) command, the directory entries that
have a file attribute of FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT will contain an
EaSize field with a reparse tag in it, so we parse it and mark the
dentry for revalidation only if it is a DFS or a symlink.
