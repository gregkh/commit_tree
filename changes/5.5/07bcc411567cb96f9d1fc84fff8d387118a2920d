Revert "mmc: sdhci: Fix incorrect switch to HS mode"

This reverts commit c894e33ddc1910e14d6f2a2016f60ab613fd8b37.

This commit aims to treat SD High speed and SDR25 as the same while
setting UHS Timings in HOST_CONTROL2 which leads to failures with some
SD cards in AM65x. Revert this commit.

The issue this commit was trying to fix can be implemented in a platform
specific callback instead of common sdhci code.
