drm/i915/gt: Prefer local path to runtime powermanagement

Avoid going to the base i915 device when we already have a path from gt
to the runtime powermanagement interface. The benefit is that it looks a
bit more self-consistent to always be acquiring the gt->uncore->rpm for
use with the gt->uncore.
