drm/amd/display: Subsample mode suboptimal for YCbCr4:2:2

[Why&How]
Driver defaults to 1-tap subsample mode for 4:2:2.
DCE11.2 added 3-tap. The policy is:
DCE8-DCE11 - change to 2-tap, it's better than 1-tap.
DCE11.2+ - use 3-tap

Note that 4:2:0 was added in DCE11.2 and already uses 3-tap always.
Note 2 is that DCE not covered on Linux, only DCN+
