ASoC: SOF: enable sync_write in hdac_bus

Align SOF HDA implementation with snd-hda-intel driver and enable
sync_write flag for all supported Intel platforms in SOF. When set,
a sync is issued after each verb write.

Sync after write has helped to overcome intermittent delays in
system resume flow on Intel Coffee Lake systems, and most recently
probe errors related to the HDMI codec on Ice Lake systems.

Matches the snd-hda-intel driver change done in commit 2756d9143aa5
("ALSA: hda - Fix intermittent CORB/RIRB stall on Intel chips").
