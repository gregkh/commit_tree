x86/build/vdso: Remove meaningless CFLAGS_REMOVE_*.o

CFLAGS_REMOVE_*.o syntax is used to drop particular flags when
building objects from C files. It has no effect for assembly files.

vdso-note.o is compiled from the assembly file, vdso-note.S, hence
CFLAGS_REMOVE_vdso-note.o is meaningless.

Neither vvar.c nor vvar.S is found in the vdso directory. Since there
is no source file to create vvar.o, CFLAGS_REMOVE_vvar.o is also
meaningless.
