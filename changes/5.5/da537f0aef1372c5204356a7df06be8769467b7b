ftrace: Add information on number of page groups allocated

Looking for ways to shrink the size of the dyn_ftrace structure, knowing the
information about how many pages and the number of groups of those pages, is
useful in working out the best ways to save on memory.

This adds one info print on how many groups of pages were used to allocate
the ftrace dyn_ftrace structures, and also shows the number of pages and
groups in the dyn_ftrace_total_info (which is used for debugging).
