xen-blkback: prevent premature module unload

Objects allocated by xen_blkif_alloc come from the 'blkif_cache' kmem
cache. This cache is destoyed when xen-blkif is unloaded so it is
necessary to wait for the deferred free routine used for such objects to
complete. This necessity was missed in commit 14855954f636 "xen-blkback:
allow module to be cleanly unloaded". This patch fixes the problem by
taking/releasing extra module references in xen_blkif_alloc/free()
respectively.
