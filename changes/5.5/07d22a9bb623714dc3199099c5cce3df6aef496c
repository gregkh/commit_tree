ASoC: core: Fix access to uninitialized list heads

The error path of soc_new_pcm_runtime() invokes soc_free_pcm_runtime()
that may cause a few problems.  First off, it calls list_del() for
rtd->list that may not be initialized.  Similarly,
snd_soc_pcm_component_free() traverses over the component list that
may not be initialized, either.  Such access to the uninitialized list
head would lead to either a BUG_ON() or a memory corruption.

This patch fixes the access to uninitialized list heads by
initializing the list heads properly at the beginning before those
error paths.
