bnxt_en: Fix NTUPLE firmware command failures.

The NTUPLE related firmware commands are sent to the wrong firmware
channel, causing all these commands to fail on new firmware that
supports the new firmware channel.  Fix it by excluding the 3
NTUPLE firmware commands from the list for the new firmware channel.

Fixes: 760b6d33410c ("bnxt_en: Add support for 2nd firmware message channel.")
