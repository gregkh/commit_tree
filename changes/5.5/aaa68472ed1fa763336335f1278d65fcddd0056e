ASoC: samsung: arndale: Simplify DAI link initialization

There is only one DAI link so we can drop an unnecessary loop statement.
Use card->dai_link in place of direct static arndale_rt5631_dai[] array
dereference as a prerequisite for adding support for other CODECs.
Unnecessary assignment of dai_link->codecs->name to NULL is removed.
