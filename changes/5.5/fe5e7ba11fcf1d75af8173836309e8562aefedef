gfs2: fix glock reference problem in gfs2_trans_remove_revoke

Commit 9287c6452d2b fixed a situation in which gfs2 could use a glock
after it had been freed. To do that, it temporarily added a new glock
reference by calling gfs2_glock_hold in function gfs2_add_revoke.
However, if the bd element was removed by gfs2_trans_remove_revoke, it
failed to drop the additional reference.

This patch adds logic to gfs2_trans_remove_revoke to properly drop the
additional glock reference.
