arm64: entry: convert el1_sync to C

This patch converts the EL1 sync entry assembly logic to C code.

Doing this will allow us to make changes in a slightly more
readable way. A case in point is supporting kernel-first RAS.
do_sea() should be called on the CPU that took the fault.

Largely the assembly code is converted to C in a relatively
straightforward manner.

Since all sync sites share a common asm entry point, the ASM_BUG()
instances are no longer required for effective backtraces back to
assembly, and we don't need similar BUG() entries.

The ESR_ELx.EC codes for all (supported) debug exceptions are now
checked in the el1_sync_handler's switch statement, which renders the
check in el1_dbg redundant. This both simplifies the el1_dbg handler,
and makes the EL1 exception handling more robust to
currently-unallocated ESR_ELx.EC encodings.
