drivers/perf: Add CCPI2 PMU support in ThunderX2 UNCORE driver.

CCPI2 is a low-latency high-bandwidth serial interface for inter socket
connectivity of ThunderX2 processors.

CCPI2 PMU supports up to 8 counters per socket. Counters are
independently programmable to different events and can be started and
stopped individually. The CCPI2 counters are 64-bit and do not overflow
in normal operation.
