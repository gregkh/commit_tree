ASoC: SOF: Intel: only support INFO_BATCH for legacy platforms

The current position update is not precise enough for PulseAudio to
work reliably with the timer-based scheduling on Baytrail,
Cherrytrail, Broadwell.

Disable the NO_PERIOD_WAKEUP capability and use BATCH to signal that
the position is only reliable and updated during period_elapsed
events.

This will be reverted when the firmware provides a more accurate
position for those platforms.
