rtw88: pci: reset H2C queue indexes in a single write

If the driver doesn't reset the host's and device's indexes
in a single write, the indexes will become different in a
short period. And it will confuse the DMA engine, make it
start to process non-existed entries.

Better to Write-1-to-reset the indexes, for the DMA engine
to know that this is a reset of the H2C queue, not a kick
off.
