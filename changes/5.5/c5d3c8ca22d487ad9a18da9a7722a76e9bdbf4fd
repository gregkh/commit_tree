locktorture: Replace strncmp() with str_has_prefix()

The strncmp() function is error-prone because it is easy to get the
length wrong, especially if the string is subject to change, especially
given the need to account for the terminating nul byte.  This commit
therefore substitutes the newly introduced str_has_prefix(), which
does not require a separately specified length.
