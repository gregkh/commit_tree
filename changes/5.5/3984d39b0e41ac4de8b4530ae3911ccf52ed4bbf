spi: spi-fsl-espi: convert transfer delay to `spi_delay` format

The way the max delay is computed for this controller, it looks like it is
searching for the max delay from an SPI message a using that.

No idea if this is valid. But this change should support both `delay_usecs`
and the new `delay` data which is of `spi_delay` type.
