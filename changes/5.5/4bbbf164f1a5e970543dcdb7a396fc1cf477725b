bpf: Add loop test case with 32 bit reg comparison against 0

Add a loop test with 32 bit register against 0 immediate:

  # ./test_verifier 631
  #631/p taken loop with back jump to 1st insn, 2 OK

Disassembly:

  [...]
  1b:	test   %edi,%edi
  1d:	jne    0x0000000000000014
  [...]

Pretty much similar to prior "taken loop with back jump to 1st
insn" test case just as jmp32 variant.
