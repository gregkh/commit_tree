MIPS: bitops: Implement test_and_set_bit() in terms of _lock variant

The only difference between test_and_set_bit() & test_and_set_bit_lock()
is memory ordering barrier semantics - the former provides a full
barrier whilst the latter only provides acquire semantics.

We can therefore implement test_and_set_bit() in terms of
test_and_set_bit_lock() with the addition of the extra memory barrier.
Do this in order to avoid duplicating logic.
