tracing: Do not create directories if lockdown is in affect

If lockdown is disabling tracing on boot up, it prevents the tracing files
from even bering created. But when that happens, there's several places that
will give a warning that the files were not created as that is usually a
sign of a bug.

Add in strategic locations where a check is made to see if tracing is
disabled by lockdown, and if it is, do not go further, and fail silently
(but print that tracing is disabled by lockdown, without doing a WARN_ON()).
