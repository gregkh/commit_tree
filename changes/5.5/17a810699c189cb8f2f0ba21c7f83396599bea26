selftests: add tests for clone3()

This adds tests for clone3() with different values and sizes
of struct clone_args.

This selftest was initially part of of the clone3() with PID selftest.
After that patch was almost merged Eugene sent out a couple of patches
to fix problems with these test.

This commit now only contains the clone3() selftest after the LPC
decision to rework clone3() with PID to allow setting the PID in
multiple PID namespaces including all of Eugene's patches.
