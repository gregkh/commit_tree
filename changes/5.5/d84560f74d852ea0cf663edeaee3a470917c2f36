jbd2: Simplify journal_unmap_buffer()

journal_unmap_buffer() checks first whether the buffer head is a journal.
If so it takes locks and then invokes jbd2_journal_grab_journal_head()
followed by another check whether this is journal head buffer.

The double checking is pointless.

Replace the initial check with jbd2_journal_grab_journal_head() which
alredy checks whether the buffer head is actually a journal.

Allows also early access to the journal head pointer for the upcoming
conversion of state lock to a regular spinlock.
