media: v4l2-mem2mem: support held capture buffers

Check for held buffers that are ready to be returned to vb2 in
__v4l2_m2m_try_queue(). This avoids drivers having to handle this
case.

Add v4l2_m2m_buf_done_and_job_finish() to correctly return source
and destination buffers and mark the job as finished while taking
a held destination buffer into account (i.e. that buffer won't be
returned). This has to be done while job_spinlock is held to avoid
race conditions.
