MIPS: barrier: Clean up rmb() & wmb() definitions

Simplify our definitions of rmb() & wmb() using the new __SYNC()
infrastructure.

The fast_rmb() & fast_wmb() macros are removed, since they only provided
a level of indirection that made the code less readable & weren't
directly used anywhere in the kernel tree.

The Octeon #ifdef'ery is removed, since the "syncw" instruction
previously used is merely an alias for "sync 4" which __SYNC() will emit
for the wmb sync type when the kernel is configured for an Octeon CPU.
Similarly __SYNC() will emit nothing for the rmb sync type in Octeon
configurations.
