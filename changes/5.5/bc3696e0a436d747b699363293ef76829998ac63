rtw88: raise firmware version debug level

It's better to print firmware version at load time.
But since we need to set debug_mask properly to default print
rtw_dbg(), raise the debug level to rtw_info() instead.

Also change the multiple line style to one line only, it will
be easier for log analyzing.
