crypto: hisilicon - fix to return sub-optimal device when best device has no qps

Currently find_zip_device() finds zip device which has the min NUMA
distance with current CPU.

This patch modifies find_zip_device to return sub-optimal device when best
device has no qps. This patch sorts all devices by NUMA distance, then
finds the best zip device which has free qp.
