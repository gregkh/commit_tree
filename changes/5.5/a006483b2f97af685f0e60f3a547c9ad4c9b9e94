x86/CPU/AMD: Ensure clearing of SME/SEV features is maintained

If the SME and SEV features are present via CPUID, but memory encryption
support is not enabled (MSR 0xC001_0010[23]), the feature flags are cleared
using clear_cpu_cap(). However, if get_cpu_cap() is later called, these
feature flags will be reset back to present, which is not desired.

Change from using clear_cpu_cap() to setup_clear_cpu_cap() so that the
clearing of the flags is maintained.
