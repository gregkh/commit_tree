ext4: introduce direct I/O read using iomap infrastructure

This patch introduces a new direct I/O read path which makes use of
the iomap infrastructure.

The new function ext4_do_read_iter() is responsible for calling into
the iomap infrastructure via iomap_dio_rw(). If the read operation
performed on the inode is not supported, which is checked via
ext4_dio_supported(), then we simply fallback and complete the I/O
using buffered I/O.

Existing direct I/O read code path has been removed, as it is now
redundant.
