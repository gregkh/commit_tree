ALSA: firewire-lib: postpone to start IR context

Some devices have a quirk to postpone transmission of isoc packet for
several dozen or hundred isoc cycles since configured to transmit.
Furthermore, some devices have a quirk to transmit isoc packet with
discontinued data of its header.

In 1394 OHCI specification, software allows to start isoc context with
certain isoc cycle. Linux firewire subsystem has kernel API to use it
as well.

This commit uses the functionality of 1394 OHCI controller to handle
the quirks. At present, this feature is convenient to ALSA bebob and
fireface driver. As a result, some devices can be safely handled, as
long as I know:
 - MAudio FireWire solo
 - MAudio ProFire Lightbridge
 - MAudio FireWire 410
 - Roland FA-66
