ext4: Enable encryption for subpage-sized blocks

Now that we have the code to support encryption for subpage-sized
blocks, this commit removes the conditional check in filesystem mount
code.

The commit also changes the support statement in
Documentation/filesystems/fscrypt.rst to reflect the fact that
encryption on filesystems with blocksize less than page size now works.

[EB: Tested with 'gce-xfstests -c ext4/encrypt_1k -g auto', using the
new "encrypt_1k" config I created.  All tests pass except for those that
already fail or are excluded with the encrypt or 1k configs, and 2 tests
that try to create 1023-byte symlinks which fails since encrypted
symlinks are limited to blocksize-3 bytes.  Also ran the dedicated
encryption tests using 'kvm-xfstests -c ext4/1k -g encrypt'; all pass,
including the on-disk ciphertext verification tests.]
