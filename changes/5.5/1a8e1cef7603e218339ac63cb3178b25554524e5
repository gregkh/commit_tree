arm64: use both ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32

So far all arm64 devices have supported 32 bit DMA masks for their
peripherals. This is not true anymore for the Raspberry Pi 4 as most of
it's peripherals can only address the first GB of memory on a total of
up to 4 GB.

This goes against ZONE_DMA32's intent, as it's expected for ZONE_DMA32
to be addressable with a 32 bit mask. So it was decided to re-introduce
ZONE_DMA in arm64.

ZONE_DMA will contain the lower 1G of memory, which is currently the
memory area addressable by any peripheral on an arm64 device.
ZONE_DMA32 will contain the rest of the 32 bit addressable memory.
