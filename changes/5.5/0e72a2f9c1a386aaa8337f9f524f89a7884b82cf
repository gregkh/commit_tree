riscv: Fix build dependency for loader

The Makefile addition for the flat image loader missed an obj prefix.

For most parallel builds this worked out fine, but with -j1 the dependency
wasn't fulfilled and thus fails:

arch/riscv/boot/loader.S: Assembler messages:
arch/riscv/boot/loader.S:7: Error: file not found: arch/riscv/boot/Image
