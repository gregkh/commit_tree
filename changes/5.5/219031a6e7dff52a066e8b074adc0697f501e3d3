media: venus: fix build on 32bit environments

As reported by jenkins@linuxtv.org, the build with i386 fails
with:

	ld: drivers/media/platform/qcom/venus/helpers.o: in function `venus_helper_load_scale_clocks':
	(.text+0x1d77): undefined reference to `__udivdi3'
	ld: (.text+0x1dce): undefined reference to `__udivdi3'
	make: *** [Makefile:1094: vmlinux] Error 1

That's because it divides an u32 bit integer by a u64 one.
