perf top: Initialize perf_env->cpuid, needed by the per arch annotation init routine

Just read it so that later on the per arch init routine can use it,
e.g. x86__annotate_init().

When using a perf.data file this is obtained from a header that was put
there by 'perf record', and then it may be for another machine, another
arch.
