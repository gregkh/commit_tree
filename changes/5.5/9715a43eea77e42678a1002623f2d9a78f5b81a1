USB: serial: quatech2: handle unbound ports

Check for NULL port data in the modem- and line-status handlers to avoid
dereferencing a NULL pointer in the unlikely case where a port device
isn't bound to a driver (e.g. after an allocation failure on port
probe).

Note that the other (stubbed) event handlers qt2_process_xmit_empty()
and qt2_process_flush() would need similar sanity checks in case they
are ever implemented.
