ACPI: processor_idle: Skip dummy wait if kernel is in guest

In function acpi_idle_do_entry(), an ioport access is used for
dummy wait to guarantee hardware behavior. But it could trigger
unnecessary VMexit if kernel is running as guest in virtualization
environment.

If it's in virtualization environment, the deeper C state enter
operation (inb()) will trap to hypervisor. It's not needed to do
dummy wait after the inb() call. So we could just remove the
dummy io port access to avoid unnecessary VMexit.

And keep dummy io port access to maintain timing for native
environment.
