dt-bindings: watchdog: Add missing clocks requirement in Samsung SoC watchdog

The Samsung SoC watchdog driver always required providing a clock
(either through platform data or from DT).  However when bindings were
added in commit 9487a9cc7140 ("watchdog: s3c2410: Add support for device
tree based probe"), they missed the requirement of clock.
