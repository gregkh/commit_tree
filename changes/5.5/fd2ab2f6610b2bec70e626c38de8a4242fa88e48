scripts/kallsyms: fix offset overflow of kallsyms_relative_base

Since commit 5e5c4fa78745 ("scripts/kallsyms: shrink table before
sorting it"), kallsyms_relative_base can be larger than _text, which
causes overflow when building the 32-bit kernel.

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/12/7/156

This is because _text is, unless --all-symbols is specified, now
trimmed from the symbol table before record_relative_base() is called.

Handle the offset signedness also for kallsyms_relative_base. Introduce
a new helper, output_address(), to reduce the code duplication.
