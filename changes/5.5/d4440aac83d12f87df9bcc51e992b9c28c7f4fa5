initrd: use do_mount() instead of ksys_mount()

All three calls to ksys_mount() in initrd-related kernel code can
be switched over to do_mount():
- the first and third arguments are const strings in the kernel,
  and do not need to be copied over from userspace;
- the fifth argument is NULL, and therefore no page needs to be,
  copied over from userspace;
- the second and fourth argument are passed through anyway.
