staging: isdn: remove assignment in if conditionals

Remove variable assignment in if statements in
drivers/staging/isdn/avm/b1.c.

ERROR: do not use assignment in if condition

Also refactor code around some if statements to remove comparisons
to NULL and unnecessary braces in single statement blocks.
