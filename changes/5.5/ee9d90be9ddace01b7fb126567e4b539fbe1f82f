arm64: Fake the IminLine size on systems affected by Neoverse-N1 #1542419

Systems affected by Neoverse-N1 #1542419 support DIC so do not need to
perform icache maintenance once new instructions are cleaned to the PoU.
For the errata workaround, the kernel hides DIC from user-space, so that
the unnecessary cache maintenance can be trapped by firmware.

To reduce the number of traps, produce a fake IminLine value based on
PAGE_SIZE.
