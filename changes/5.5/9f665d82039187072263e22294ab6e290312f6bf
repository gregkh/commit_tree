staging: rtl8723bs: reduce stack usage of rtw_cfg80211_unlink_bss

The build of xtensa allmodconfig gives warning of:
In function 'rtw_cfg80211_unlink_bss':
warning: the frame size of 1136 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes

Instead of having 'select_network' structure as a variable use it as a
pointer.
