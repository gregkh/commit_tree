platform/x86: asus-laptop: switch to using polled mode of input devices

We have added polled mode to the normal input devices with the intent of
retiring input_polled_dev. This converts Asus laptop driver to use the
polling mode of standard input devices and removes dependency on
INPUT_POLLDEV.

Also removed no longed needed set_bit(EV_ABS, ...) as
input_set_abs_oarams() does it for us.
