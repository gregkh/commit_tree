ARM: OMAP2+: Update 4430 voltage controller operating points

The current operating points in the mainline kernel are out of date for
at least omap4430. Let's use the values from Motorola Mapphone Linux
Android kernel as presumably those have been verified.

Note that these are only used by voltage controller, they do not enable
any new operating points for cpufreq. Looking at the recent omap3 cpufreq
related patches posted, that's a totally separate series of patches.
