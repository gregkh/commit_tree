drm/amd/display: Do not call update bounding box on dc create

[Why]
In Hybrid Graphics, dcn2_1_soc struct stays alive through PnP.
This causes an issue on dc init where dcn2_1_soc which has been
updated by update_bw_bounding_box gets put into dml->soc.
As update_bw_bounding_box is currently incorrect for dcn2.1,
this makes dml calculations fail due to incorrect parameters,
leading to a crash on PnP.

[How]
Comment out update_bw_bounding_box call for now.
