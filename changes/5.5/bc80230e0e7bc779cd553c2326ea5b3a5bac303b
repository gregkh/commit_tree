btrfs: Return offset from find_desired_extent

Instead of using an input pointer parameter as the return value and have
an int as the return type of find_desired_extent, rework the function to
directly return the found offset. Doing that the 'ret' variable in
btrfs_llseek_file can be removed. Additional (subjective) benefit is
that btrfs' llseek function now resemebles those of the other major
filesystems.
