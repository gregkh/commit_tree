net: Fixed updating of ethertype in skb_mpls_push()

The skb_mpls_push was not updating ethertype of an ethernet packet if
the packet was originally received from a non ARPHRD_ETHER device.

In the below OVS data path flow, since the device corresponding to
port 7 is an l3 device (ARPHRD_NONE) the skb_mpls_push function does
not update the ethertype of the packet even though the previous
push_eth action had added an ethernet header to the packet.

recirc_id(0),in_port(7),eth_type(0x0800),ipv4(tos=0/0xfc,ttl=64,frag=no),
actions:push_eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:00,dst=00:00:00:00:00:00),
push_mpls(label=13,tc=0,ttl=64,bos=1,eth_type=0x8847),4
