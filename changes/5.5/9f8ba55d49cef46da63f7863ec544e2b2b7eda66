rcutorture: Remove CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n from scenarios

A number of mainstream CPU families are no longer capable of building
kernels having CONFIG_SMP=y and CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n, so this commit
removes this combination from the rcutorture scenarios having it.
People wishing to try out this combination may still do so using the
"--kconfig CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n CONFIG_SUSPEND=n CONFIG_HIBERNATION=n"
argument to the tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/bin/kvm.sh script
that is used to run rcutorture.
