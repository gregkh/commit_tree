ASoC: adau7118: Fix Kconfig warning without CONFIG_I2C

When building a kernel without CONFIG_I2C, Kconfig warns:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for REGMAP_I2C
  Depends on [n]: I2C [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - SND_SOC_ADAU7118_I2C [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y]

Add missing I2C dependency to SND_SOC_ADAU7118_I2C to fix this.
