mtd: spi-nor: Move condition to avoid a NULL check

When the controller is not under the SPI-MEM interface it may implement
the optional controller_ops->erase() method.

nor->spimem and nor->controller_ops are mutually exclusive. Move the
nor->controller_ops->erase != NULL check as an 'else if' case to
nor->spimem, in order to avoid the nor->controller_ops != NULL
check.
