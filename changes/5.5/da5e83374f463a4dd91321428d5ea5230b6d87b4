ALSA: bebob: expand delay of start for IR context just for version 3 firmware

As long as I investigated, there's some cases about the delay for device
between establishing OUTPUT_PLUG and transmitting first isoc packet. For
devices which support BeBoB protocol version 1 can transmit the packet
within several hundred milliseconds, while for devices which support
BeBoB protocol version 3 can transmit the packet within 2 seconds.

Devices with protocol version 1:
 * Edirol FA-66
 * Yamaha GO46
 * Terratec Phase x24 FW
 * M-Audio FireWire AudioPhile
 * M-Audio FireWire Solo
 * M-Audio FireWire 1814
 * M-Audio FireWire 410
 * Focusrite Saffire Pro 26 I/O

Devices with protocol version 3:
 * M-Audio Profire Lightbridge
 * Behringer FCA610
 * Phonic Firefly 202

At present ALSA bebob driver postpones starting IR context during
1.5 sec for all of supported devices. The delay is too long for
devices with protocol version 1, while it's not enough for devices with
protocol version 3.

This commit improves the delay for these protocols.
