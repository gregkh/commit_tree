kselftest: Fix NULL INSTALL_PATH for TARGETS runlist

As per commit 131b30c94fbc ("kselftest: exclude failed TARGETS from
runlist") failed targets were excluded from the runlist. But value
$$INSTALL_PATH is always NULL. It should be $INSTALL_PATH instead
$$INSTALL_PATH.

So, fix Makefile to use $INSTALL_PATH.
