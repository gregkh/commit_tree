tcp: Protect accesses to .ts_recent_stamp with {READ,WRITE}_ONCE()

Syncookies borrow the ->rx_opt.ts_recent_stamp field to store the
timestamp of the last synflood. Protect them with READ_ONCE() and
WRITE_ONCE() since reads and writes aren't serialised.

Use of .rx_opt.ts_recent_stamp for storing the synflood timestamp was
introduced by a0f82f64e269 ("syncookies: remove last_synq_overflow from
struct tcp_sock"). But unprotected accesses were already there when
timestamp was stored in .last_synq_overflow.
