block: sed-opal: Add support to read/write opal tables generically

This feature gives the user RW access to any opal table with admin1
authority. The flags described in the new structure determines if the user
wants to read/write the data. Flags are checked for valid values in
order to allow future features to be added to the ioctl.

The user can provide the desired table's UID. Also, the ioctl provides a
size and offset field and internally will loop data accesses to return
the full data block. Read overrun is prevented by the initiator's
sec_send_recv() backend. The ioctl provides a private field with the
intention to accommodate any future expansions to the ioctl.
