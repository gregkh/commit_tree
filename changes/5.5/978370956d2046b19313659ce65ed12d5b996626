x86/mce/therm_throt: Do not access uninitialized therm_work

It is relatively easy to trigger the following boot splat on an Ice Lake
client platform. The call stack is like:

  kernel BUG at kernel/timer/timer.c:1152!

  Call Trace:
  __queue_delayed_work
  queue_delayed_work_on
  therm_throt_process
  intel_thermal_interrupt
  ...

The reason is that a CPU's thermal interrupt is enabled prior to
executing its hotplug onlining callback which will initialize the
throttling workqueues.

Such a race can lead to therm_throt_process() accessing an uninitialized
therm_work, leading to the above BUG at a very early bootup stage.

Therefore, unmask the thermal interrupt vector only after having setup
the workqueues completely.
