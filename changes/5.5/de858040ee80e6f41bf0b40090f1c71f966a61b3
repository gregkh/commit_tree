arm64: entry: refine comment of stack overflow check

Stack overflow checking can be done by testing sp & (1 << THREAD_SHIFT)
only for the stacks are aligned to (2 << THREAD_SHIFT) with size of
(1 << THREAD_SIZE), and this is the case when CONFIG_VMAP_STACK is set.

Fix the code comment to avoid confusion.
