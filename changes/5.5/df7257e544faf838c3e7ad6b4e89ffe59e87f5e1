ASoC: SOF: Intel: Baytrail: clarify mutual exclusion with Atom/SST driver

Some distros select all options blindly, which leads to confusion and
bug reports. Since SOF does not support Baytrail-CR for now, and
UCM/topology files are still being propagated to downstream distros,
make SOF on Baytrail an opt-in option that first require distros to
opt-out of existing defaults.
