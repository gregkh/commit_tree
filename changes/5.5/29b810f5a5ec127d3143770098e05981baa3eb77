x86/xen/32: Make xen_iret_crit_fixup() independent of frame layout

Now that SS:ESP always get saved by SAVE_ALL, this also needs to be
accounted for in xen_iret_crit_fixup(). Otherwise the old_ax value gets
interpreted as EFLAGS, and hence VM86 mode appears to be active all the
time, leading to random "vm86_32: no user_vm86: BAD" log messages alongside
processes randomly crashing.

Since following the previous model (sitting after SAVE_ALL) would further
complicate the code _and_ retain the dependency of xen_iret_crit_fixup() on
frame manipulations done by entry_32.S, switch things around and do the
adjustment ahead of SAVE_ALL.
