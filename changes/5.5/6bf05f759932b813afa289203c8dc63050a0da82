media: af9035: add support for Logilink VG0022A.

This includes a hack for the device as it returns only 0xff after a new
firmware is loaded. To quote Mauro:

"When the [...] firmware that came with the device is replaced
by a new one, any I2C data received from the tuner will be
replaced by 0xff.

Probably, the vendor firmware has some patch specifically
designed for this device. So, we can't replace by the generic
firmware.

The right solution would be to extract the [...] firmware from
the original driver and ask the driver to load the specifically
designed firmware, but, while we don't have that, the next best
solution is to just keep the original firmware at the device."
