PM / devfreq: tegra30: Drop write-barrier

There is no need in a write-barrier now, given that interrupt masking is
handled by CPU's GIC now. Hence we know exactly that interrupt won't fire
after stopping the devfreq's governor. In other cases we don't care about
potential buffering of the writes to hardware and thus there is no need to
stall CPU.
