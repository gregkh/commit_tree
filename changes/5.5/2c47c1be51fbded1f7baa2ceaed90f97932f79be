gfs2: clean up iopen glock mess in gfs2_create_inode

Before this patch, gfs2_create_inode had a use-after-free for the
iopen glock in some error paths because it did this:

	gfs2_glock_put(io_gl);
fail_gunlock2:
	if (io_gl)
		clear_bit(GLF_INODE_CREATING, &io_gl->gl_flags);

In some cases, the io_gl was used for create and only had one
reference, so the glock might be freed before the clear_bit().
This patch tries to straighten it out by only jumping to the
error paths where iopen is properly set, and moving the
gfs2_glock_put after the clear_bit.
