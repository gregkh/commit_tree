mips: Fix unroll macro when building with Clang

Building with Clang errors after commit 6baaeadae911 ("MIPS: Provide
unroll() macro, use it for cache ops") since the GCC_VERSION macro
is defined in include/linux/compiler-gcc.h, which is only included
in compiler.h when using GCC:

In file included from arch/mips/kernel/mips-mt.c:20:
./arch/mips/include/asm/r4kcache.h:254:1: error: use of undeclared
identifier 'GCC_VERSION'; did you mean 'S_VERSION'?
__BUILD_BLAST_CACHE(i, icache, Index_Invalidate_I, Hit_Invalidate_I, 32,
)
^

                     ^

Use CONFIG_GCC_VERSION, which will always be set by Kconfig.
Additionally, Clang 8 had improvements around __builtin_constant_p so
use that as a lower limit for this check with Clang (although MIPS
wasn't buildable until Clang 9); building a kernel with Clang 9.0.0
has no issues after this change.
