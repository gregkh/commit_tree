ARM: OMAP2+: make omap44xx_sha0_hwmod and omap44xx_l3_main_2__des static

The omap44xx_sha0_hwmod and omap44xx_l3_main_2__des objects are
not exported so make them static to avoid the following warnings:

arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap_hwmod_44xx_data.c:793:19: warning: symbol 'omap44xx_sha0_hwmod' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap_hwmod_44xx_data.c:977:26: warning: symbol 'omap44xx_l3_main_2__des' was not declared. Should it be static?
