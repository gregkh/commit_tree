media: hantro: Do not reorder H264 scaling list

Scaling list supplied from userspace should be in matrix order
and can be used without applying the inverse scanning process.

The HW also only support 8x8 scaling list for the Y component, indices 0
and 1 in the scaling list supplied from userspace.

Remove reordering and write the scaling matrix in an order expected by
the VPU, also only allocate memory for the two 8x8 lists supported.
