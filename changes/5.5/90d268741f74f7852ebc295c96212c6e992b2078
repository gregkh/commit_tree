drm/amd/display: Added pixel dynamic expansion control.

[Why]
To compare the crc of the framebuffer data at input of
display pipeline with the crc of the otg, we need to
disable pixel formatter's dynamic expansion feature during
crc capture and keep it enable in the normal operation.

[HOW]
Expose a new interface in DM and dc for pixel formatter
(fmt dynamic bitdepth expansion control). Interface control
the FMT_DYNAMIC_EXP_EN  bit, during crc capture keep
it disabled.
