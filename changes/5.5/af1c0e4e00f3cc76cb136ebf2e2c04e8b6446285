llc2: Fix return statement of llc_stat_ev_rx_null_dsap_xid_c (and _test_c)

When a frame with NULL DSAP is received, llc_station_rcv is called.
In turn, llc_stat_ev_rx_null_dsap_xid_c is called to check if it is a NULL
XID frame. The return statement of llc_stat_ev_rx_null_dsap_xid_c returns 1
when the incoming frame is not a NULL XID frame and 0 otherwise. Hence, a
NULL XID response is returned unexpectedly, e.g. when the incoming frame is
a NULL TEST command.

To fix the error, simply remove the conditional operator.

A similar error in llc_stat_ev_rx_null_dsap_test_c is also fixed.
