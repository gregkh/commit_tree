drm/nouveau: Resume hotplug interrupts earlier

Currently, we enable hotplug detection only after we re-enable the
display. However, this is too late if we're planning on sending sideband
messages during the resume process - which we'll need to do in order to
reprobe the topology on resume.

So, enable hotplug events before reinitializing the display.
