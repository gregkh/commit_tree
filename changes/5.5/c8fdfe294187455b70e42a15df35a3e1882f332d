ext4: move set iomap routines into a separate helper ext4_set_iomap()

Separate the iomap field population code that is currently within
ext4_iomap_begin() into a separate helper ext4_set_iomap(). The intent
of this function is self explanatory, however the rationale behind
taking this step is to reeduce the overall clutter that we currently
have within the ext4_iomap_begin() callback.
