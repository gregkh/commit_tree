drm/amdkfd: Eliminate get_atc_vmid_pasid_mapping_valid

get_atc_vmid_pasid_mapping_valid() is very similar to
get_atc_vmid_pasid_mapping_pasid(), so they can be merged into a new
function get_atc_vmid_pasid_mapping_info() to reduce register access
times. More importantly, getting the PASID and the valid bit atomically
with a single read fixes some potential race conditions where the
mapping changes between the two reads.
