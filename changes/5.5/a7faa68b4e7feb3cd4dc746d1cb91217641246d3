octeontx2-af: Start/Stop traffic in CGX along with NPC

Traffic for a CGX mapped NIXLF can be stopped by disabling entries
in NPC MCAM or by configuring CGX and mailbox messages exist for the
two options. If traffic is stopped at CGX then VFs of that PF are
also effected hence CGX traffic should be started/stopped by
tracking all the users of it. This patch implements that CGX users
tracking. CGX is also configured along with NPC if required.

Also removed a check which mandates even number of LBK VFs.
