ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Restore debugfs support

Commit fd7d58f0dbc3 ("ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: renormalize based on recent
additions") removed explicit enable line for CONFIG_DEBUG_FS, because
that feature has been selected by other enabled options: CONFIG_TRACING,
which were enabled by CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS.

In meantime, commit 0e4a459f56c3 ("tracing: Remove unnecessary DEBUG_FS
dependency") removed the dependency between CONFIG_DEBUG_FS and
CONFIG_TRACING, so CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is no longer enabled in default builds.

Enable it again explicitly, as debugfs support is essential for various
automated testing tools.
