MIPS: Loongson: Unify LOONGSON3/LOONGSON64 Kconfig usage

There are mixed LOONGSON3/LOONGSON64 usages in recently changes, let's
establish some rules:

1, In Kconfig symbols, we only use CPU_LOONGSON64, MACH_LOONGSON64 and
SYS_HAS_CPU_LOONGSON64, all other derived symbols use "LOONGSON3" since
they all not widely-used symbols and sometimes not suitable for all
64-bit Loongson processors. E.g., we use symbols LOONGSON3_ENHANCEMENT,
CPU_LOONGSON3_WORKAROUNDS, etc.

2, Hide GSx64/GSx64E in Kconfig title since it is not useful for
general users. However, in the full description we use a more detailed
manner. E.g., GS264/GS464/GS464E/GS464V.

All Kconfig titles and descriptions of Loongson processors and machines
have also been updated in this patch for consistency.
