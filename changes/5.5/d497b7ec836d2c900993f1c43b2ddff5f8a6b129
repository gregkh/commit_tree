s390/pci: add error message on device number limit

The config option CONFIG_PCI_NR_FUNCTIONS sets a limit on the number of
PCI functions we can support. Previously on reaching this limit there
was no indication why newly attached devices are not recognized by Linux
which could be quite confusing. Thus this patch adds a pr_err() for this
case.
