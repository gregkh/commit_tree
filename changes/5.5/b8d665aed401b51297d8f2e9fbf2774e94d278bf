hwrng: omap3-rom - Update to use standard driver data

Let's update omap3-rom-rng to use standard driver data to make it easier
to add runtime PM support in the following patch. Just use it for the
rng ops and clock for now. Let's still keep also old rng_clk still around,
we will remove delayed work and rng_clk with runtime PM in the next patch.
