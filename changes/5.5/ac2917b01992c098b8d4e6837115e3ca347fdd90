drm/arm/mali: make malidp_mw_connector_helper_funcs static

The malidp_mw_connector_helper_funcs is not referenced by name
outside of the file it is in, so make it static to avoid the
following warning:

drivers/gpu/drm/arm/malidp_mw.c:59:41: warning: symbol 'malidp_mw_connector_helper_funcs' was not declared. Should it be static?
