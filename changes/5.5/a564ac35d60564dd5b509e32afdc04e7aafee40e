Revert "gpio: thunderx: Switch to GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP"

This reverts commit a7fc89f9d5fcc10a5474cfe555f5a9e5df8b0f1f because
there are some bugs in this commit, and we don't have a simple way to
fix these bugs. So revert this commit to make the thunderx gpio work
on the stable kernel at least. We will switch to GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
for thunderx gpio by following patches.
