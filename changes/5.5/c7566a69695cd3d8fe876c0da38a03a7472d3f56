selftests/bpf: Add field existence CO-RE relocs tests

Add a bunch of tests validating CO-RE is handling field existence
relocation. Relaxed CO-RE relocation mode is activated for these new
tests to prevent libbpf from rejecting BPF object for no-match
relocation, even though test BPF program is not going to use that
relocation, if field is missing.
