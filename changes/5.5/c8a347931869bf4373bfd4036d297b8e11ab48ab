scsi: qla2xxx: unregister ports after GPN_FT failure

When ports are lost due to unzoning them, and the initiator port is
not part of any more zones, the GPN_FT command used for the fabric
scan may fail. In this case, the current code simply gives up after a
few retries. But if the zone is gone, all rports should actually be
marked as lost.

Fix this by jumping to the code that handles logout after GNN_FT after
scan retries are exhausted.
