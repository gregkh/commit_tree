net: usb: lan78xx: Add .ndo_features_check

As reported by Eric Dumazet, there are still some outstanding
cases where the driver does not handle TSO correctly when skb's
are over a certain size. Most cases have been fixed, this patch
should ensure that forwarded SKB's that are greater than
MAX_SINGLE_PACKET_SIZE - TX_OVERHEAD are software segmented
and handled correctly.
