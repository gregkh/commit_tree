xfs: initialize iomap->flags in xfs_bmbt_to_iomap

Currently we don't overwrite the flags field in the iomap in
xfs_bmbt_to_iomap.  This works fine with 0-initialized iomaps on stack,
but is harmful once we want to be able to reuse an iomap in the
writeback code.  Replace the shared parameter with a set of initial
flags an thus ensures the flags field is always reinitialized.
