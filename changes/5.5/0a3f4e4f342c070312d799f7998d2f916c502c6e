bnxt_en: Extend ETHTOOL_RESET to hot reset driver.

If firmware supports hot reset, extend ETHTOOL_RESET to support
hot reset driver which does not require a driver reload after
ETHTOOL_RESET.  The driver will go through the same coordinated
reset sequence as a firmware initiated fatal/non-fatal reset.
