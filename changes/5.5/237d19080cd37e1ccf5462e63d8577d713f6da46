ASoC: soc-core: remove topology specific operation

soc-core has some API which is used from topology, but it is doing
topology specific operation at soc-core.
soc-core should care about core things, and topology should care
about topology things, otherwise, it is very confusable.

For example topology type is not related to soc-core,
it is topology side issue.

This patch removes meaningless check from soc-core.

This patch keeps extra initialization/destruction at
snd_soc_add_dai_link() / snd_soc_remove_dai_link()
which were for topology.
From this patch, non-topology card can use it.
