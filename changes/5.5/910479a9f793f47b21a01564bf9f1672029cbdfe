net: aquantia: add basic ptp_clock callbacks

Basic HW functions implemented for adjusting frequency,
adjusting time, getting and setting time.
With these callbacks we now do register ptp clock in the system.

Firmware interface parts are defined for PTP requests and interactions.
Enable/disable PTP counters in HW on clock register/unregister.
