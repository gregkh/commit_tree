cpufreq: tegra124: Add suspend and resume support

This patch adds suspend and resume pm ops for cpufreq driver.

PLLP is the safe clock source for CPU during system suspend and
resume as PLLP rate is below the CPU Fmax at Vmin.

CPUFreq driver suspend switches the CPU clock source to PLLP and
disables the DFLL clock.

During system resume, warmboot code powers up the CPU with PLLP
clock source. So CPUFreq driver resume enabled DFLL clock and
switches CPU back to DFLL clock source.
