net: sched: update action implementations to support flags

Extend struct tc_action with new "tcfa_flags" field. Set the field in
tcf_idr_create() function and provide new helper
tcf_idr_create_from_flags() that derives 'cpustats' boolean from flags
value. Update individual hardware-offloaded actions init() to pass their
"flags" argument to new helper in order to skip percpu stats allocation
when user requested it through flags.
