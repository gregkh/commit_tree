quota: Make dquot_disable() work without quota inodes

Quota on and quota off are protected by s_umount semaphore held in
exclusive mode since commit 7d6cd73d33b6 "quota: Hold s_umount in
exclusive mode when enabling / disabling quotas". This makes it
impossible for dquot_disable() to race with other enabling or disabling
of quotas. Simplify the cleanup done by dquot_disable() based on this
fact and also remove some stale comments. As a bonus this cleanup makes
dquot_disable() properly handle a case when there are no quota inodes.
