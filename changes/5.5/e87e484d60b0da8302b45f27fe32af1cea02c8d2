crypto: blake2b - simplify key init

The keyed init writes the key bytes to the input buffer and does an
update. We can do that in two ways: fill the buffer and update
immediatelly. This is what current blake2b_init_key does. Any other
following _update or _final will continue from the updated state.

The other way is to write the key and set the number of bytes to process
at the next _update or _final, lazy evaluation. Which leads to the the
simplified code in this patch.
