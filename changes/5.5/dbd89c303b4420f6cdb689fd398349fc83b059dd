efi/gop: Return EFI_SUCCESS if a usable GOP was found

If we've found a usable instance of the Graphics Output Protocol
(GOP) with a framebuffer, it is possible that one of the later EFI
calls fails while checking if any support console output. In this
case status may be an EFI error code even though we found a usable
GOP.

Fix this by explicitly return EFI_SUCCESS if a usable GOP has been
located.
