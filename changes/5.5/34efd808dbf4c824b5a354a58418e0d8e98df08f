media: ti-vpe: vpe: use standard struct instead of duplicating fields

For each queue we need to maintain resolutions, pixel format,
bytesperline, sizeimage, colorspace, etc.

Instead of manually adding more entries in the vpe_q_data struct, it is
better to just add a "struct v4l2_format" member and use that to store
all needed information.
