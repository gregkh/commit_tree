irqchip/gic-v3-its: Kill its->ite_size and use TYPER copy instead

Now that we have a copy of TYPER in the ITS structure, rely on this
to provide the same service as its->ite_size, which gets axed.
Errata workarounds are now updating the cached fields instead of
requiring a separate field in the ITS structure.
