afs: Fix creation calls in the dynamic root to fail with EOPNOTSUPP

Fix the lookup method on the dynamic root directory such that creation
calls, such as mkdir, open(O_CREAT), symlink, etc. fail with EOPNOTSUPP
rather than failing with some odd error (such as EEXIST).

lookup() itself tries to create automount directories when it is invoked.
These are cached locally in RAM and not committed to storage.
