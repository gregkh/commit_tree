io_uring: add support for canceling timeout requests

We might have cases where the need for a specific timeout is gone, add
support for canceling an existing timeout operation. This works like the
POLL_REMOVE command, where the application passes in the user_data of
the timeout it wishes to cancel in the sqe->addr field.
