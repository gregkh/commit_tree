hwmon: Add support for ltc2947

The ltc2947 is a high precision power and energy monitor with an
internal sense resistor supporting up to +/- 30A. Three internal no
Latency ADCs ensure accurate measurement of voltage and current, while
high-bandwidth analog multiplication of voltage and current provides
accurate power measurement in a wide range of applications. Internal or
external clocking options enable precise charge and energy measurements.
