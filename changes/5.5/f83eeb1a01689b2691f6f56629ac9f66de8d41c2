sched/cputime: Rename vtime_account_system() to vtime_account_kernel()

vtime_account_system() decides if we need to account the time to the
system (__vtime_account_system()) or to the guest (vtime_account_guest()).

So this function is a misnomer as we are on a higher level than
"system". All we know when we call that function is that we are
accounting kernel cputime. Whether it belongs to guest or system time
is a lower level detail.

Rename this function to vtime_account_kernel(). This will clarify things
and avoid too many underscored vtime_account_system() versions.
