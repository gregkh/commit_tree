powerpc/security/book3s64: Report L1TF status in sysfs

Some PowerPC CPUs are vulnerable to L1TF to the same extent as to
Meltdown. It is also mitigated by flushing the L1D on privilege
transition.

Currently the sysfs gives a false negative on L1TF on CPUs that I
verified to be vulnerable, a Power9 Talos II Boston 004e 1202, PowerNV
T2P9D01.
