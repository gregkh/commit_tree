ALSA: bebob: expand sleep just after breaking connections for protocol version 1

As long as I investigated, some devices with BeBoB protocol version 1
can be freezed during several hundreds milliseconds after breaking
connections. When accessing during the freezed time, any transaction
is corrupted. In the worst case, the device is going to reboot.

I can see this issue in:
 * Roland FA-66
 * M-Audio FireWire Solo

This commit expands sleep just after breaking connections to avoid
the freezed time as much as possible. I note that the freeze/reboot
behaviour is similar to below models:
 * Focusrite Saffire Pro 10 I/O
 * Focusrite Saffire Pro 26 I/O

The above models certainly reboot after breaking connections.
