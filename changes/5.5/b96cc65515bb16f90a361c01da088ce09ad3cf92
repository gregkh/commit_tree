mm/gup.c: allow CMA migration to propagate errors back to caller

check_and_migrate_cma_pages() was recording the result of
__get_user_pages_locked() in an unsigned "nr_pages" variable.

Because __get_user_pages_locked() returns a signed value that can
include negative errno values, this had the effect of hiding errors.

Change check_and_migrate_cma_pages() implementation so that it uses a
signed variable instead, and propagates the results back to the caller
just as other gup internal functions do.

This was discovered with the help of unsigned_lesser_than_zero.cocci.
