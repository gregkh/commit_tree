thunderbolt: Add Display Port adapter pairing and resource management

To perform proper Display Port tunneling for Thunderbolt 3 devices we
need to allocate DP resources for DP IN port before they can be used.
The reason for this is that the user can also connect a monitor directly
to the Type-C ports in which case the Thunderbolt controller acts as
re-driver for Display Port (no tunneling takes place) taking the DP
sinks away from the connection manager. This allocation is done using
special sink allocation registers available through the link controller.

We can pair DP IN to DP OUT only if

 * DP IN has sink allocated via link controller
 * DP OUT port receives hotplug event

For DP IN adapters (only for the host router) we first query whether
there is DP resource available (it may be the previous instance of the
driver for example already allocated it) and if it is we add it to the
list. We then update the list when after each plug/unplug event to a DP
IN/OUT adapter. Each time the list is updated we try to find additional
DP IN <-> DP OUT pairs for tunnel establishment. This strategy also
makes it possible to establish another tunnel in case there are 3
monitors connected and one gets unplugged releasing the DP IN adapter
for the new tunnel.
