arm64: agilex: enable USB and LEDs on agilex devkit

Enable USB on the Agilex devkit. Also the Agilex devkit will use the
same daughter card that is used on Stratix10, thus it map the same
LEDs and GPIOs.

pushbutton PB_SW0 = gpio1.io4
pushbutton PB_SW1 = gpio1.io5
LED HPS_LED0      = gpio1.io20
LED HPS_LED1      = gpio1.io19
LED HPS_LED2      = gpio1.io21
