platform/chrome: wilco_ec: Add keyboard backlight LED support

The EC is in charge of controlling the keyboard backlight on
the Wilco platform. We expose a standard LED class device
named platform::kbd_backlight.

Since the EC will never change the backlight level of its own accord,
we don't need to implement a brightness_get() method.
