RDMA/hns: Rename the functions used inside creating cq

Current names of functions are not proper, such as hns_roce_free_cq,
actually it means free cqc, thus we rename them. Furthermore, functions
used inside one file can be named without the prefix hns_roce_ which will
make the functions for verbs symbols more eye-catching.
