audit: Move audit_log_task declaration under CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL

The 0-DAY found that audit_log_task is not declared under
CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL which causes compilation error when
it is not defined:

    kernel/bpf/syscall.o: In function `bpf_audit_prog.isra.30':
 >> syscall.c:(.text+0x860): undefined reference to `audit_log_task'

Adding the audit_log_task declaration and stub within
CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL ifdef.
