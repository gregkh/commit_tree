lkdtm/bugs: fix build error in lkdtm_UNSET_SMEP

When building ARCH=um with CONFIG_UML_X86=y and CONFIG_64BIT=y we get
the build errors:

drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c: In function ‘lkdtm_UNSET_SMEP’:
drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c:288:8: error: implicit declaration of function ‘native_read_cr4’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  cr4 = native_read_cr4();
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c:290:13: error: ‘X86_CR4_SMEP’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘X86_FEATURE_SMEP’?
  if ((cr4 & X86_CR4_SMEP) != X86_CR4_SMEP) {
             ^~~~~~~~~~~~
             X86_FEATURE_SMEP
drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c:290:13: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c:297:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘native_write_cr4’; did you mean ‘direct_write_cr4’? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  native_write_cr4(cr4);
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  direct_write_cr4

So specify that this block of code should only build when
CONFIG_X86_64=y *AND* CONFIG_UML is unset.
