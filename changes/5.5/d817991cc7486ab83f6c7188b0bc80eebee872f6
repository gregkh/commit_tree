xsk: Restructure/inline XSKMAP lookup/redirect/flush

In this commit the XSKMAP entry lookup function used by the XDP
redirect code is moved from the xskmap.c file to the xdp_sock.h
header, so the lookup can be inlined from, e.g., the
bpf_xdp_redirect_map() function.

Further the __xsk_map_redirect() and __xsk_map_flush() is moved to the
xsk.c, which lets the compiler inline the xsk_rcv() and xsk_flush()
functions.

Finally, all the XDP socket functions were moved from linux/bpf.h to
net/xdp_sock.h, where most of the XDP sockets functions are anyway.

This yields a ~2% performance boost for the xdpsock "rx_drop"
scenario.
