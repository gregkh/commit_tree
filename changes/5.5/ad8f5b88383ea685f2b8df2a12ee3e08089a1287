crypto: x86/poly1305 - unify Poly1305 state struct with generic code

In preparation of exposing a Poly1305 library interface directly from
the accelerated x86 driver, align the state descriptor of the x86 code
with the one used by the generic driver. This is needed to make the
library interface unified between all implementations.
