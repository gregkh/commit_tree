io_uring: io_wq_create() returns an error pointer, not NULL

syzbot reported an issue where we crash at setup time if failslab is
used. The issue is that io_wq_create() returns an error pointer on
failure, not NULL. Hence io_uring thought the io-wq was setup just
fine, but in reality it's a garbage error pointer.

Use IS_ERR() instead of a NULL check, and assign ret appropriately.
