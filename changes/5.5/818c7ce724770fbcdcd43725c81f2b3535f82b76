efi/libstub/random: Initialize pointer variables to zero for mixed mode

Commit:

  0d95981438c3 ("x86: efi/random: Invoke EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL to seed the UEFI RNG table")

causes the drivers/efi/libstub/random.c code to get used on x86 for the first time.

But this code was not written with EFI mixed mode in mind (running a 64
bit kernel on 32 bit EFI firmware), this causes the kernel to crash during
early boot when running in mixed mode.

The problem is that in mixed mode pointers are 64 bit, but when running on
a 32 bit firmware, EFI calls which return a pointer value by reference only
fill the lower 32 bits of the passed pointer, leaving the upper 32 bits
uninitialized which leads to crashes.

This commit fixes this by initializing pointers which are passed by
reference to EFI calls to NULL before passing them, so that the upper 32
bits are initialized to 0.
