riscv: abstract out CSR names for supervisor vs machine mode

Many of the privileged CSRs exist in a supervisor and machine version
that are used very similarly.  Provide versions of the CSR names and
fields that map to either the S-mode or M-mode variant depending on
a new CONFIG_RISCV_M_MODE kconfig symbol.
