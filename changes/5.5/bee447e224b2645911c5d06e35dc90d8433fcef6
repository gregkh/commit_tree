drm/bridge: dw-hdmi: Refuse DDC/CI transfers on the internal I2C controller

The DDC/CI protocol involves sending a multi-byte request to the
display via I2C, which is typically followed by a multi-byte
response. The internal I2C controller only allows single byte
reads/writes or reads of 8 sequential bytes, hence DDC/CI is not
supported when the internal I2C controller is used. The I2C
transfers complete without errors, however the data in the response
is garbage. Abort transfers to/from slave address 0x37 (DDC) with
-EOPNOTSUPP, to make it evident that the communication is failing.
