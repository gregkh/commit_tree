s390/dasd: fix memleak in path handling error case

If for whatever reason the dasd_eckd_check_characteristics() function
exits after at least some paths have their configuration data
allocated those data is never freed again. In the error case the
device->private pointer is set to NULL and dasd_eckd_uncheck_device()
will exit without freeing the path data because of this NULL pointer.

Fix by calling dasd_eckd_clear_conf_data() for error cases.

Also use dasd_eckd_clear_conf_data() in dasd_eckd_uncheck_device()
to avoid code duplication.
