PCI: Protect pci_reassign_bridge_resources() against concurrent addition/removal

pci_reassign_bridge_resources() can be called by pci_resize_resource() at
runtime, it walks the PCI tree up and down, and it isn't currently
protected against any changes or hotplug operation.

Hold the pci_bus_sem to protect it.
