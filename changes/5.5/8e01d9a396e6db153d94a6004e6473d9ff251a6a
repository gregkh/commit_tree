KVM: arm64: vgic-v4: Move the GICv4 residency flow to be driven by vcpu_load/put

When the VHE code was reworked, a lot of the vgic stuff was moved around,
but the GICv4 residency code did stay untouched, meaning that we come
in and out of residency on each flush/sync, which is obviously suboptimal.

To address this, let's move things around a bit:

- Residency entry (flush) moves to vcpu_load
- Residency exit (sync) moves to vcpu_put
- On blocking (entry to WFI), we "put"
- On unblocking (exit from WFI), we "load"

Because these can nest (load/block/put/load/unblock/put, for example),
we now have per-VPE tracking of the residency state.

Additionally, vgic_v4_put gains a "need doorbell" parameter, which only
gets set to true when blocking because of a WFI. This allows a finer
control of the doorbell, which now also gets disabled as soon as
it gets signaled.
