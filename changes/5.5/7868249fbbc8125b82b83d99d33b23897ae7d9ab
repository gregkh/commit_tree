s390/test_unwind: add CALL_ON_STACK tests

Add CALL_ON_STACK helper testing. Tests make sure that we can unwind from
switched stack to original one up to task pt_regs (nodat -> task stack).

UWM_SWITCH_STACK could not be used together with UWM_THREAD because
get_stack_info explicitly restricts unwinding to task stack if
task != current.
