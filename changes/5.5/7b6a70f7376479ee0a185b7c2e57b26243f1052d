lwtunnel: be STRICT to validate the new LWTUNNEL_IP(6)_OPTS

LWTUNNEL_IP(6)_OPTS are the new items in ip(6)_tun_policy, which
are parsed by nla_parse_nested_deprecated(). We should check it
strictly by setting .strict_start_type = LWTUNNEL_IP(6)_OPTS.

This patch also adds missing LWTUNNEL_IP6_OPTS in ip6_tun_policy.
