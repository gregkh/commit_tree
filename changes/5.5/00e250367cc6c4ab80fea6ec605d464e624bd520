ACPI: button: Add DMI quirk for Asus T200TA

The Asus T200TA lid has some weird behavior where _LID keeps reporting
closed after every second openening of the lid. Causing immediate
re-suspend after opening every other open.

I've looked at the AML code but it involves talking to the EC and we
have no idea what the EC is doing. Setting lid_init_state to
ACPI_BUTTON_LID_INIT_OPEN fixes the unwanted behavior, so this commit
adds a DMI based quirk to use ACPI_BUTTON_LID_INIT_OPEN on the T200TA.
