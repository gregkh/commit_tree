Bluetooth: hci_qca: Update regulator_set_load() usage

Since the introduction of '5451781dadf8 ("regulator: core: Only count
load for enabled consumers")' in v5.0, the requested load of a regulator
consumer is only accounted for when said consumer is voted enabled.

So there's no need to vote for load ever time the regulator is
enabled or disabled.
