ACPI: platform: Unregister stale platform devices

When commit 68bdb6773289 ("ACPI: add support for ACPI reconfiguration
notifiers") introduced reconfiguration notifiers, it missed the point
that the ACPI table, which might be loaded and then unloaded via
ConfigFS, could contain devices that were not enumerated by their
parents.

In such cases, the stale platform device is dangling in the system
while the rest of the devices from the same table are already gone.

Introduce acpi_platform_device_remove_notify() notifier that, in
similar way to IÂ²C or SPI buses, unregisters the platform devices
on table removal event.
