drm/i915/execlists: Use per-process HWSP as scratch

Some of our commands (MI_FLUSH_DW / PIPE_CONTROL) require a post-sync write
operation to be performed. Currently we're using dedicated VMA for
PIPE_CONTROL and global HWSP for MI_FLUSH_DW.
On execlists platforms, each of our contexts has an area that can be
used as scratch space. Let's use that instead.
