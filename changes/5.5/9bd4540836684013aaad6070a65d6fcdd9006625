CIFS: Properly process SMB3 lease breaks

Currenly we doesn't assume that a server may break a lease
from RWH to RW which causes us setting a wrong lease state
on a file and thus mistakenly flushing data and byte-range
locks and purging cached data on the client. This leads to
performance degradation because subsequent IOs go directly
to the server.

Fix this by propagating new lease state and epoch values
to the oplock break handler through cifsFileInfo structure
and removing the use of cifsInodeInfo flags for that. It
allows to avoid some races of several lease/oplock breaks
using those flags in parallel.
