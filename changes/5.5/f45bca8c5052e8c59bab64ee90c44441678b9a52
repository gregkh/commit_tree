scsi: qla2xxx: Fix double scsi_done for abort path

Current code assumes abort will remove the original command from the active
list where scsi_done will not be called. Instead, the eh_abort thread will
do the scsi_done. That is not the case.  Instead, we have a double
scsi_done calls triggering use after free.

Abort will tell FW to release the command from FW possesion. The original
command will return to ULP with error in its normal fashion via scsi_done.
eh_abort path would wait for the original command completion before
returning.  eh_abort path will not perform the scsi_done call.
