ARM: dts: pandora-common: define wl1251 as child node of mmc3

Since v4.7 the dma initialization requires that there is a
device tree property for "rx" and "tx" channels which is
not provided by the pdata-quirks initialization.

By conversion of the mmc3 setup to device tree this will
finally allows to remove the OpenPandora wlan specific omap3
data-quirks.
