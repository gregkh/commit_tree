net: dsa: sja1105: Reconcile the meaning of TPID and TPID2 for E/T and P/Q/R/S

For first-generation switches (SJA1105E and SJA1105T):
- TPID means C-Tag (typically 0x8100)
- TPID2 means S-Tag (typically 0x88A8)

While for the second generation switches (SJA1105P, SJA1105Q, SJA1105R,
SJA1105S) it is the other way around:
- TPID means S-Tag (typically 0x88A8)
- TPID2 means C-Tag (typically 0x8100)

In other words, E/T tags untagged traffic with TPID, and P/Q/R/S with
TPID2.

So the patch mentioned below fixed VLAN filtering for P/Q/R/S, but broke
it for E/T.

We strive for a common code path for all switches in the family, so just
lie in the static config packing functions that TPID and TPID2 are at
swapped bit offsets than they actually are, for P/Q/R/S. This will make
both switches understand TPID to be ETH_P_8021Q and TPID2 to be
ETH_P_8021AD. The meaning from the original E/T was chosen over P/Q/R/S
because E/T is actually the one with public documentation available
(UM10944.pdf).
