net/sonic: Fix command register usage

There are several issues relating to command register usage during
chip initialization.

Firstly, the SONIC sometimes comes out of software reset with the
Start Timer bit set. This gets logged as,

    macsonic macsonic eth0: sonic_init: status=24, i=101

Avoid this by giving the Stop Timer command earlier than later.

Secondly, the loop that waits for the Read RRA command to complete has
the break condition inverted. That's why the for loop iterates until
its termination condition. Call the helper for this instead.

Finally, give the Receiver Enable command after clearing interrupts,
not before, to avoid the possibility of losing an interrupt.
