net: hns: fix soft lockup when there is not enough memory

When there is not enough memory and napi_alloc_skb() return NULL,
the HNS driver will print error message, and than try again, if
the memory is not enough for a while, huge error message and the
retry operation will cause soft lockup.

When napi_alloc_skb() return NULL because of no memory, we can
get a warn_alloc() call trace, so this patch deletes the error
message. We already use polling mode to handle irq, but the
retry operation will render the polling weight inactive, this
patch just return budget when the rx is not completed to avoid
dead loop.
