i2c: i2c-stm32f7: fix 10-bits check in slave free id search loop

Fix a typo in the free slave id search loop. Instead of I2C_CLIENT_PEC,
it should have been I2C_CLIENT_TEN. The slave id 1 can only handle 7-bit
addresses and thus is not eligible in case of 10-bit addresses.
As a matter of fact none of the slave id support I2C_CLIENT_PEC, overall
check is performed at the beginning of the stm32f7_i2c_reg_slave function.
