page_pool: add destroy attempts counter and rename tracepoint

When Jonathan change the page_pool to become responsible to its
own shutdown via deferred work queue, then the disconnect_cnt
counter was removed from xdp memory model tracepoint.

This patch change the page_pool_inflight tracepoint name to
page_pool_release, because it reflects the new responsability
better.  And it reintroduces a counter that reflect the number of
times page_pool_release have been tried.

The counter is also used by the code, to only empty the alloc
cache once.  With a stuck work queue running every second and
counter being 64-bit, it will overrun in approx 584 billion
years. For comparison, Earth lifetime expectancy is 7.5 billion
years, before the Sun will engulf, and destroy, the Earth.
