drm/i915: Don't advertise modes that exceed the max plane size

Modern platforms allow the transcoders hdisplay/vdisplay to exceed the
planes' max resolution. This has the nasty implication that modes on the
connectors' mode list may not be usable when the user asks for a
fullscreen plane. Seeing as that is the most common use case it seems
prudent to filter out modes that don't allow for fullscreen planes to
be enabled.

Let's do that in the connetor .mode_valid() hook so that normally
such modes are kept hidden but the user is still able to forcibly
specify such a mode if they know they don't need fullscreen planes.

This is in line with ealier policies regarding certain clock limits.
The idea is to prevent the casual user from encountering a mode that
would fail under typical conditions, but allow the expert user to
force things if they so wish.

Maybe in the future we should consider automagically using two
planes when one can't cover the entire screen? Wouldn't be a
great match for the current uapi with explicit planes though,
but I guess no worse than using two pipes (which we apparently
have to in the future anyway). Either that or we'd have to
teach userspace to do it for us.
