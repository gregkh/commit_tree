drm/amdgpu: invalidate mmhub semaphore workaround in gmc9/gmc10

It may lose gpuvm invalidate acknowldege state across power-gating off
cycle. To avoid this issue in gmc9/gmc10 invalidation, add semaphore acquire
before invalidation and semaphore release after invalidation.

After adding semaphore acquire before invalidation, the semaphore
register become read-only if another process try to acquire semaphore.
Then it will not be able to release this semaphore. Then it may cause
deadlock problem. If this deadlock problem happens, it needs a semaphore
firmware fix.
