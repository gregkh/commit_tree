habanalabs: skip VA block list update in reset flow

Reduce context close time by skipping the VA block free list update in
order to avoid hard reset with open contexts.
Reset with open contexts can potentially lead to a kernel crash as the
generic pool of the MMU hops is destroyed while it is not empty because
some unmap operations are not done.
The commit affect mainly when running on simulator.
