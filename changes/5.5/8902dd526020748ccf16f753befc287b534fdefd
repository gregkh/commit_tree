init: Support mounting root file systems over SMB

Add a new virtual device named /dev/cifs (0xfe) to tell the kernel to
mount the root file system over the network by using SMB protocol.

cifs_root_data() will be responsible to retrieve the parsed
information of the new command-line option (cifsroot=) and then call
do_mount_root() with the appropriate mount options for cifs.ko.
