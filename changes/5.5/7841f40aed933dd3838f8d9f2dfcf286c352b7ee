perf hist: Count the total cycles of all samples

We can get the per sample cycles by hist__account_cycles(). It's also
useful to know the total cycles of all samples in order to get the
cycles coverage for a single program block in further. For example:

  coverage = per block sampled cycles / total sampled cycles

This patch creates a new argument 'total_cycles' in hist__account_cycles(),
which will be added with the cycles of each sample.
