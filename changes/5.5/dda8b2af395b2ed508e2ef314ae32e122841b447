tpm: Revert "tpm_tis_core: Set TPM_CHIP_FLAG_IRQ before probing for interrupts"

There has been a bunch of reports (one from kernel bugzilla linked)
reporting that when this commit is applied it causes on some machines
boot freezes.

Unfortunately hardware where this commit causes a failure is not widely
available (only one I'm aware is Lenovo T490), which means we cannot
predict yet how long it will take to properly fix tpm_tis interrupt
probing.

Thus, the least worst short term action is to revert the code to the
state before this commit. In long term we need fix the tpm_tis probing
code to work on machines that Stefan's fix was supposed to fix.
