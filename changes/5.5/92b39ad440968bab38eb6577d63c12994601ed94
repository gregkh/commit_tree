hwmon: (pmbus/ibm-cffps) Fix LED blink behavior

The LED blink_set function incorrectly did not tell the PSU LED to blink
if brightness was LED_OFF. Fix this, and also correct the LED_OFF
command data, which should give control of the LED back to the PSU
firmware. Also prevent I2C failures from getting the driver LED state
out of sync and add some dev_dbg statements.
