platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix ACPI errors caused by too small buffer

The HP WMI calls may take up to 128 bytes of data as input, and
the AML methods implementing the WMI calls, declare a couple of fields for
accessing input in different sizes, specifycally the HWMC method contains:

        CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, 0x0400, D128)

Even though we do not use any of the WMI command-types which need a buffer
of this size, the APCI interpreter still tries to create it as it is
declared in generoc code at the top of the HWMC method which runs before
the code looks at which command-type is requested.

This results in many of these errors on many different HP laptop models:

[   14.459261] ACPI Error: Field [D128] at 1152 exceeds Buffer [NULL] size 160 (bits) (20170303/dsopcode-236)
[   14.459268] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\HWMC] (Node ffff8edcc61507f8), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)
[   14.459279] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\_SB.WMID.WMAA] (Node ffff8edcc61523c0), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)

This commit increases the size of the data element of the bios_args struct
to 128 bytes fixing these errors.
