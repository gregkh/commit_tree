bpf: Refactor x86 JIT into helpers

Refactor x86 JITing of LDX, STX, CALL instructions into separate helper
functions.  No functional changes in LDX and STX helpers.  There is a minor
change in CALL helper. It will populate target address correctly on the first
pass of JIT instead of second pass. That won't reduce total number of JIT
passes though.
