perf annotate: Pass a 'map_symbol' in places receiving a pair of 'map' and 'symbol' pointers

We are already passing things like:

  symbol__annotate(ms->sym, ms->map, ...)

So shorten the signature of such functions to receive the 'map_symbol'
pointer.

This also paves the way to having the 'struct map_groups' pointer in the
'struct map_symbol' so that we can get rid of 'struct map'->groups.
