x86/hyperv: Micro-optimize send_ipi_one()

When sending an IPI to a single CPU there is no need to deal with cpumasks.

With 2 CPU guest on WS2019 a minor (like 3%, 8043 -> 7761 CPU cycles)
improvement with smp_call_function_single() loop benchmark can be seeb. The
optimization, however, is tiny and straitforward. Also, send_ipi_one() is
important for PV spinlock kick.

Switching to the regular APIC IPI send for CPU > 64 case does not make
sense as it is twice as expesive (12650 CPU cycles for __send_ipi_mask_ex()
call, 26000 for orig_apic.send_IPI(cpu, vector)).
