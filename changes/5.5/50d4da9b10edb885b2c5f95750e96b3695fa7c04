clk: tegra: Support for OSC context save and restore

This patch adds support for saving OSC clock frequency and the
drive-strength during OSC clock init and creates an API to restore
OSC control register value from the saved context.

This API is invoked by Tegra210 clock driver during system resume
to restore the  OSC clock settings.
