spi: introduce `delay` field for `spi_transfer` + spi_transfer_delay_exec()

The change introduces the `delay` field to the `spi_transfer` struct as an
`struct spi_delay` type.
This intends to eventually replace `delay_usecs`.

But, since there are many users of `delay_usecs`, this needs some
intermediate work.
A helper called `spi_transfer_delay_exec()` is also added, which maintains
backwards compatibility with `delay_usecs`, by assigning the value to
`delay` if non-zero.
This should maintain backwards compatibility with current users of
`udelay_usecs`.
