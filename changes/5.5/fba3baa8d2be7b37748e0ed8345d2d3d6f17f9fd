drm/tilcdc: plane: Make structure tilcdc_plane_funcs constant

The static structure tilcdc_plane_funcs, of type drm_plane_funcs, is
used only when passed the fourth argument to drm_plane_init(); however,
this fourth parameter is declared as const in the function definition.
Hence make tilcdc_plane_funcs constant as well.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
