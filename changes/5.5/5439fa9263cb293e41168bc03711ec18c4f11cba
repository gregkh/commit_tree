media: ov6650: Fix default format not applied on device probe

It is not clear what pixel format is actually configured in hardware on
reset.  MEDIA_BUS_FMT_YUYV8_2X8, assumed on device probe since the
driver was intiially submitted, is for sure not the one.

Fix it by explicitly applying a known, driver default frame format just
after initial device reset.
