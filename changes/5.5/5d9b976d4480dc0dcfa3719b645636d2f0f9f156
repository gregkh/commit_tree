octeontx2-af: Support fixed transmit scheduler topology

CN96xx initial silicon doesn't support all features pertaining to
NIX transmit scheduling and shaping.
- It supports a fixed topology of 1:1 mapped transmit
  limiters at all levels.
- Supports DWRR only at SMQ/MDQ and TL1.
- Doesn't support shaping and coloring.

This patch adds HW capability structure by which each variant
and skew of silicon can be differentiated by their supported
features. And adds support for A0 silicon's transmit scheduler
capabilities or rather limitations.
