arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix roc-rk3399-pc regulator input rails

Few, know rk808 pmic regulators VCC[1-4], VCC[6-7], VCC[9-11],
VDD_LOG, VDD_GPU, VDD_CPU_B, VCC3V3_SYS are inputting with vcc_sys
which is 5V power rail from dc_12v.

So, replace the vin-supply of above mentioned regulators
with vcc_sys as per the PMIC-RK808-D page of roc-rk3399-pc
schematics.
