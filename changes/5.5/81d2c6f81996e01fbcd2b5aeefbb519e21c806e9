kasan: support instrumented bitops combined with generic bitops

Currently bitops-instrumented.h assumes that the architecture provides
atomic, non-atomic and locking bitops (e.g. both set_bit and __set_bit).
This is true on x86 and s390, but is not always true: there is a
generic bitops/non-atomic.h header that provides generic non-atomic
operations, and also a generic bitops/lock.h for locking operations.

powerpc uses the generic non-atomic version, so it does not have it's
own e.g. __set_bit that could be renamed arch___set_bit.

Split up bitops-instrumented.h to mirror the atomic/non-atomic/lock
split. This allows arches to only include the headers where they
have arch-specific versions to rename. Update x86 and s390.

(The generic operations are automatically instrumented because they're
written in C, not asm.)
