smb3: remove confusing dmesg when mounting with encryption ("seal")

The smb2/smb3 message checking code was logging to dmesg when mounting
with encryption ("seal") for compounded SMB3 requests.  When encrypted
the whole frame (including potentially multiple compounds) is read
so the length field is longer than in the case of non-encrypted
case (where length field will match the the calculated length for
the particular SMB3 request in the compound being validated).

Avoids the warning on mount (with "seal"):

   "srv rsp padded more than expected. Length 384 not ..."
