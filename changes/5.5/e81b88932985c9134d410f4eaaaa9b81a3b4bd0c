extcon-intel-cht-wc: Don't reset USB data connection at probe

Intel Cherry Trail Whiskey Cove extcon driver connect USB data lines to
PMIC at driver probing for further charger detection. This causes reset of
USB data sessions and removing all devices from bus. If system was
booted from Live CD or USB dongle, this makes system unusable.

Check if USB ID pin is floating and re-route data lines in this case
only, don't touch otherwise.
