drm/dp_mst: Remove PDT teardown in drm_dp_destroy_port() and refactor

This will allow us to add some locking for port->* members, in
particular the PDT and ->connector, which can't be done from
drm_dp_destroy_port() since we don't know what locks the caller might be
holding.

Note that we already do this in delayed_destroy_work (renamed from
destroy_connector_work in this patch) for ports, we're just making it so
mstbs are also destroyed in this worker.
