drm/amd/display: Optimize clocks on clock change

[WHY]
Presently, there is no way for clocks to be lowered, only raised.

[HOW]
Compare clock status against previous known clock status, and optimize
if different.
This requires re-ordering the layout of the dc_clocks structure, as the
current ordering allows identical clock states to appear different.
