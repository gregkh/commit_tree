rcu: Make kernel-mode nohz_full CPUs invoke the RCU core processing

If a nohz_full CPU is idle or executing in userspace, it makes good sense
to keep it out of RCU core processing.  After all, the RCU grace-period
kthread can see its quiescent states and all of its callbacks are
offloaded, so there is nothing for RCU core processing to do.

However, if a nohz_full CPU is executing in kernel space, the RCU
grace-period kthread cannot do anything for it, so such a CPU must report
its own quiescent states.  This commit therefore makes nohz_full CPUs
skip RCU core processing only if the scheduler-clock interrupt caught
them in idle or in userspace.
