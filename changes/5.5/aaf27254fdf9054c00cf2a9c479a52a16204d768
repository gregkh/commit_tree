ice: add build_skb() support

Driver is now prepared for building the skb around the existing Rx
buffer, so introduce the ice_build_skb responsible for it. Make use of
XDP's data_meta as well.

I've observed around 30% less CPU consumption with build_skb Rx path, in
comparison to legacy Rx. What stands behind such result is the avoidance
of flow_dissector (which we were diving into via eth_get_headlen) and no
memcpy calls.
