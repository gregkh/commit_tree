scsi: lpfc: Fix device recovery errors after PLOGI failures

When target-side fault injections are made, the driver isn't reconnecting
to the remote port. The driver is logging "2753" error messages which
state:

"PLOGI failure DID:1B2400 Status:x3/xf0240008"

The failures status is indicating a Illegal field error, which points to
the Temporary RPI field being used for the ELS. This error typically means
the driver used an RPI that was already registered (shouldn't be registered
if using it in this context).

Study has found that if the driver were in discovery attempts and
encountered an error, it wouldn't flag the temporary rpi in error.  Yet the
rpi was released for reallocation in these error paths and another ELS
could allocate the rpi. In the failure situation a retry was done on an ELS
that had encountered an error, and as the rpi wasn't marked in error, the
ELS reused the rpi it originally allocated. But that rpi had been allocated
by a different ELS issued after the original error and before the retry
attempt. The different ELS had succeeded and the RPI was registered.

Fix by marking the rpi state for the node to be in error, aka as needing
reallocation, upon an error in the els processing.  Error state marking is
always done prior to release back to the internal rpi free list, which the
driver wasn't doing in cases prior.

Also enhanced some of the logging to help in the next case of problem
troubleshooting.
