NFS: add COPY_NOTIFY operation

Try using the delegation stateid, then the open stateid.

Only NL4_NETATTR, No support for NL4_NAME and NL4_URL.
Allow only one source server address to be returned for now.

To distinguish between same server copy offload ("intra") and
a copy between different server ("inter"), do a check of server
owner identity and also make sure server is capable of doing
a copy offload.
