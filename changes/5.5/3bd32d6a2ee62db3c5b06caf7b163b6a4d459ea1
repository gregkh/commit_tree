lib/vsprintf: Add %pfw conversion specifier for printing fwnode names

Add support for %pfw conversion specifier (with "f" and "P" modifiers) to
support printing full path of the node, including its name ("f") and only
the node's name ("P") in the printk family of functions. The two flags
have equivalent functionality to existing %pOF with the same two modifiers
("f" and "P") on OF based systems. The ability to do the same on ACPI
based systems is added by this patch.

On ACPI based systems the resulting strings look like

	\_SB.PCI0.CIO2.port@1.endpoint@0

where the nodes are separated by a dot (".") and the first three are
ACPI device nodes and the latter two ACPI data nodes.
