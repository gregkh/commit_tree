drm/amd/powerplay: dynamically disable ds and ulv for compute

This is to improve the performance in the compute mode
for vega10. For example, the original performance for a rocm
bandwidth test: 2G internal GPU copy, is about 99GB/s.
With the idle power features disabled dynamically, the porformance
is promoted to about 215GB/s.
