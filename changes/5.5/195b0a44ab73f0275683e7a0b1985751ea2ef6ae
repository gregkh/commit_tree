xfs: make the xfs_dir3_icfree_hdr available to xfs_dir2_node_addname_int

Return the xfs_dir3_icfree_hdr used by the helpers called from
xfs_dir2_node_addname_int to the main function to prepare for the
next round of changes where we'll use the ichdr in xfs_dir3_icfree_hdr
to avoid extra operations to find the bests pointers.
