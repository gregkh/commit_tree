Input: rmi_f54 - read from FIFO in 32 byte blocks

The F54 Report Data is apparently read through a fifo and for
the smbus protocol that means that between reading a block of 32
bytes the rmiaddr shouldn't be incremented. However, changing
that causes other non-fifo reads to fail and so that change was
reverted.

This patch changes just the F54 function and it now reads 32 bytes
at a time from the fifo, using the F54_FIFO_OFFSET to update the
start address that is used when reading from the fifo.

This has only been tested with smbus, not with i2c or spi. But I
suspect that the same is needed there since I think similar
problems will occur there when reading more than 256 bytes.
