ice: Implement ethtool ops for channels

Add code to query and set the number of channels on the primary VSI for a
PF. This is accessed from the 'ethtool -l' and 'ethtool -L' commands,
respectively.  Though the ice driver supports asymmetric queues report an
IRQ vector that has both Rx and Tx queues attached and is counted as a
'combined' channel.
