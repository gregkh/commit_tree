btrfs: get bdev directly from fs_devices in submit_extent_page

This is preparatory patch to remove @bdev parameter from
submit_extent_page. It can't be removed completely, because the cgroups
need it for wbc when initializing the bio

wbc_init_bio
  bio_associate_blkg_from_css
    dereference bdev->bi_disk->queue

The bdev pointer is the same as latest_bdev, thus no functional change.
We can retrieve it from fs_devices that's reachable through several
dereferences. The local variable shadows the parameter, but that's only
temporary.
