usb: gadget: u_serial: diagnose missed console messages

Insert markers in console stream marking places where data
is missing. This makes the hole in the data stand out clearly
instead of glueing together unrelated messages.

Example output as seen from USB host side:

[    0.064078] pinctrl core: registered pin 16 (UART3_RTS_N PC0) on 70000868.pinmux
[    0.064130] pinctrl
[missed 114987 bytes]
[    4.302299] udevd[134]: starting version 3.2.5
[    4.306845] random: udevd: uninitialized urandom read (16 bytes read)
