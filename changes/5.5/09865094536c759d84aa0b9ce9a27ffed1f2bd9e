ARM: dts: Add OPP-V2 table for AM3517

The AM3517 only lists 600MHz @ 1.2V, but the register values for
0x4830A204 = 1b86 802f, it seems like am3517 might be a derivative
of the omap36 which OPPs would be OPP50 (300 MHz) and OPP100
(600 MHz).

This patch sets up the OPP50 and OPP100 tables at 300MHz and 600MHz
for the AM3517 with each having an operating voltage at 1.2V.
