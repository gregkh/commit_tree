cifs: Adjust indentation in smb2_open_file

Clang warns:

../fs/cifs/smb2file.c:70:3: warning: misleading indentation; statement
is not part of the previous 'if' [-Wmisleading-indentation]
         if (oparms->tcon->use_resilient) {
         ^
../fs/cifs/smb2file.c:66:2: note: previous statement is here
        if (rc)
        ^
1 warning generated.

This warning occurs because there is a space after the tab on this line.
Remove it so that the indentation is consistent with the Linux kernel
coding style and clang no longer warns.
