ARM: imx_v6_v7_defconfig: Build USB_CONFIGFS into kernel

Some imx chips (6sll, 6ulz, 7ulp) don't have ethernet support and only a
limited number of USB controllers. For such cases NXP suggests
configuring the USB controller as an ethernet gadget for network boot
testing.

Set USB_CONFIGFS to be built into the kernel so that we can configure
the ethernet gadget without needing modules.
