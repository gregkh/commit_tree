powerpc: Fix __clear_user() with KUAP enabled

The KUAP implementation adds calls in clear_user() to enable and
disable access to userspace memory. However, it doesn't add these to
__clear_user(), which is used in the ptrace regset code.

As there's only one direct user of __clear_user() (the regset code),
and the time taken to set the AMR for KUAP purposes is going to
dominate the cost of a quick access_ok(), there's not much point
having a separate path.

Rename __clear_user() to __arch_clear_user(), and make __clear_user()
just call clear_user().
