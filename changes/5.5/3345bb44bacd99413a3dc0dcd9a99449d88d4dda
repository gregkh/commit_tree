cifs: Fix lookup of SMB connections on multichannel

With the addition of SMB session channels, we introduced new TCP
server pointers that have no sessions or tcons associated with them.

In this case, when we started looking for TCP connections, we might
end up picking session channel rather than the master connection,
hence failing to get either a session or a tcon.

In order to fix that, this patch introduces a new "is_channel" field
to TCP_Server_Info structure so we can skip session channels during
lookup of connections.
