media: hantro: Set H264 FIELDPIC_FLAG_E flag correctly

The FIELDPIC_FLAG_E bit should be set when field_pic_flag exists in stream,
it is currently set based on field_pic_flag of current frame.
The PIC_FIELDMODE_E bit is correctly set based on the field_pic_flag.

Fix this by setting the FIELDPIC_FLAG_E bit when frame_mbs_only is not set.
