media: vim2m: Fix abort issue

Currently, if start streaming -> stop streaming -> start streaming
sequence is executed, driver will end job prematurely, if ctx->translen
is higher than 1, because "aborting" flag is still set from previous
stop streaming command.

Fix that by clearing "aborting" flag in start streaming handler.
