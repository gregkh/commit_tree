mm: vmscan: turn shrink_node_memcg() into shrink_lruvec()

An lruvec holds LRU pages owned by a certain NUMA node and cgroup.
Instead of awkwardly passing around a combination of a pgdat and a memcg
pointer, pass down the lruvec as soon as we can look it up.

Nested callers that need to access node or cgroup properties can look them
them up if necessary, but there are only a few cases.
