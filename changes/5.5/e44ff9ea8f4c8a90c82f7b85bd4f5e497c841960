powerpc/tools: Don't quote $objdump in scripts

Some of our scripts are passed $objdump and then call it as
"$objdump". This doesn't work if it contains spaces because we're
using ccache, for example you get errors such as:

  ./arch/powerpc/tools/relocs_check.sh: line 48: ccache ppc64le-objdump: No such file or directory
  ./arch/powerpc/tools/unrel_branch_check.sh: line 26: ccache ppc64le-objdump: No such file or directory

Fix it by not quoting the string when we expand it, allowing the shell
to do the right thing for us.

Fixes: 4ea80652dc75 ("powerpc/64s: Tool to flag direct branches from unrelocated interrupt vectors")
