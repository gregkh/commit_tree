net: hns3: do not allocate linear data for fraglist skb

Currently, napi_alloc_skb() is used to allocate skb for fraglist
when the head skb is not enough to hold the remaining data, and
the remaining data is added to the frags part of the fraglist skb,
leaving the linear part unused.

So this patch passes length of 0 to allocate fraglist skb with
zero size of linear data.
