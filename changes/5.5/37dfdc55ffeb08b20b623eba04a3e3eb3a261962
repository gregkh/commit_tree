drm/dp_mst: Cleanup drm_dp_send_link_address() a bit

Declare local pointer to the drm_dp_link_address_ack_reply struct
instead of constantly dereferencing it through the union in
txmsg->reply. Then, invert the order of conditionals so we don't have to
do the bulk of the work inside them, and can wrap lines even less. Then
finally, rearrange variable declarations a bit.
