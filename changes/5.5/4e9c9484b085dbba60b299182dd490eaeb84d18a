can: rx-offload: Prepare for CAN FD support

The skbs for classic CAN and CAN FD frames are allocated with seperate
functions: alloc_can_skb() and alloc_canfd_skb().

In order to support CAN FD frames via the rx-offload helper, the driver
itself has to allocate the skb (depending whether it received a classic
CAN or CAN FD frame), as the rx-offload helper cannot know which kind of
CAN frame the driver has received.

This patch moves the allocation of the skb into the struct
can_rx_offload::mailbox_read callbacks of the the flexcan and ti_hecc
driver and adjusts the rx-offload helper accordingly.
