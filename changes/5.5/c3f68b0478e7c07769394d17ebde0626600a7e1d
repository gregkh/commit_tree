powerpc/watchpoint: Fix ptrace code that muck around with address/len

ptrace_set_debugreg() does not consider new length while overwriting
the watchpoint. Fix that. ppc_set_hwdebug() aligns watchpoint address
to doubleword boundary but does not change the length. If address
range is crossing doubleword boundary and length is less then 8, we
will lose samples from second doubleword. So fix that as well.
