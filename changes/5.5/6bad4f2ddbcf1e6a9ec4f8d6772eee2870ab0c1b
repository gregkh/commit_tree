ARM: dts: logicpd-torpedo-37xx-devkit: Increase camera pixel clock

The default settings used on the baseboard are good for the
OMAP3530 and are compatible with the DM3730.  However, the
DM3730 has a faster L3 clock which means the camera pixel clock
can also be pushed faster as well.

This patch increase the Pixel clock to 90MHz which is the
maximum the current ISP driver permits for an L3 clock
of 200MHz.
