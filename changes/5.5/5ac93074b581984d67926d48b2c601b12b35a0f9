selftests/bpf: Move test_queue_stack_map.h into progs/ where it belongs

test_queue_stack_map.h is used only from BPF programs. Thus it should be
part of progs/ subdir. An added benefit of moving it there is that new
TEST_RUNNER_DEFINE_RULES macro-rule will properly capture dependency on
this header for all BPF objects and trigger re-build, if it changes.
