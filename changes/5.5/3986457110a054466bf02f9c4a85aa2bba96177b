drm: rcar_lvds: Fix color mismatches on R-Car H2 ES2.0 and later

Commit 5cca30ebe089be23 ("drm/rcar-du: Add LVDS_LANES quirk") states
that LVDS lanes 1 and 3 are inverted on R-Car H2 ES1 only, and that the
problem has been fixed in newer revisions.

However, the code didn't take into account the actual hardware revision,
thus applying the quirk also on newer hardware revisions, causing green
color reversals.

Fix this by applying the quirk when running on R-Car H2 ES1.x only.
