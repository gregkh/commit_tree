powerpc/pseries: Add cpu DLPAR support for drc-info property

Older firmwares provided information about Dynamic Reconfig
Connectors (DRC) through several device tree properties, namely
ibm,drc-types, ibm,drc-indexes, ibm,drc-names, and
ibm,drc-power-domains. New firmwares have the ability to present this
same information in a much condensed format through a device tree
property called ibm,drc-info.

The existing cpu DLPAR hotplug code only understands the older DRC
property format when validating the drc-index of a cpu during a
hotplug add. This updates those code paths to use the ibm,drc-info
property, when present, instead for validation.
