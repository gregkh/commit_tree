pipe: Check for ring full inside of the spinlock in pipe_write()

Make pipe_write() check to see if the ring has become full between it
taking the pipe mutex, checking the ring status and then taking the
spinlock.

This can happen if a notification is written into the pipe as that happens
without the pipe mutex.
