ASoC: soc-pcm: check symmetry before hw_params

This reverts commit 957ce0c6b8a1f (ASoC: soc-pcm: check symmetry after
hw_params).

That commit cause soc_pcm_params_symmetry can't take effect.
cpu_dai->rate, cpu_dai->channels and cpu_dai->sample_bits
are updated in the middle of soc_pcm_hw_params, so move
soc_pcm_params_symmetry to the end of soc_pcm_hw_params is
not a good solution, for judgement of symmetry in the function
is always true.

FIXME:
According to the comments of that commit, I think the case
described in the commit should disable symmetric_rates
in Back-End, rather than changing the position of
soc_pcm_params_symmetry.
