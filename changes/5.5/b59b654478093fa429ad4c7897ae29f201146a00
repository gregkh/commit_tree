regulator: core: Don't try to remove device links if add failed

device_link_add() might not always succeed depending on the type of
device link and the rest of the dependencies in the system. If
device_link_add() didn't succeed, then we shouldn't try to remove the
link later on as it might remove a link someone else created.
