tracing: trigger: Replace unneeded RCU-list traversals

With CONFIG_PROVE_RCU_LIST, I had many suspicious RCU warnings
when I ran ftracetest trigger testcases.

I investigated those warnings and found that the RCU-list
traversals in event trigger and hist didn't need to use
RCU version because those were called only under event_mutex.

I also checked other RCU-list traversals related to event
trigger list, and found that most of them were called from
event_hist_trigger_func() or hist_unregister_trigger() or
register/unregister functions except for a few cases.

Replace these unneeded RCU-list traversals with normal list
traversal macro and lockdep_assert_held() to check the
event_mutex is held.
