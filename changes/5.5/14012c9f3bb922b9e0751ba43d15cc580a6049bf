r8169: fix jumbo configuration for RTL8168evl

Alan reported [0] that network is broken since the referenced commit
when using jumbo frames. This commit isn't wrong, it just revealed
another issue that has been existing before. According to the vendor
driver the RTL8168e-specific jumbo config doesn't apply for RTL8168evl.
