sfc: change ARFS expiry mechanism

The old rfs_filters_added method for determining the quota could potentially
 allow the NIC to become filled with old filters, which never get tested for
 expiry.  Instead, explicitly make expiry check work depend on the number of
 filters installed, and don't count checking slots without filters in as
 doing work.  This guarantees that each filter will be checked for expiry at
 least once every thirty seconds (assuming the channel to which it belongs is
 NAPI polling actively) regardless of fill level.
