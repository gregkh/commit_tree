net: mvneta: rely on build_skb in mvneta_rx_swbm poll routine

Refactor mvneta_rx_swbm code introducing mvneta_swbm_rx_frame and
mvneta_swbm_add_rx_fragment routines. Rely on build_skb in oreder to
allocate skb since the previous patch introduced buffer recycling using
the page_pool API.
This patch fixes even an issue in the original driver where dma buffers
are accessed before dma sync.
mvneta driver can run on not cache coherent devices so it is
necessary to sync DMA buffers before sending them to the device
in order to avoid memory corruptions. Running perf analysis we can
see a performance cost associated with this DMA-sync (anyway it is
already there in the original driver code). In follow up patches we
will add more logic to reduce DMA-sync as much as possible.
