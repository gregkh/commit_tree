crypto: inside-secure - Fix stability issue with Macchiatobin

This patch corrects an error in the Transform Record Cache initialization
code that was causing intermittent stability problems on the Macchiatobin
board.

Unfortunately, due to HW platform specifics, the problem could not happen
on the main development platform, being the VCU118 Xilinx development
board. And since it was a problem with hash table access, it was very
dependent on the actual physical context record DMA buffers being used,
i.e. with some (bad) luck it could seemingly work quit stable for a while.
