clk: meson: axg_audio: add sm1 support

Add sm1 support the axg audio clock controllers. This new version is
indeed derived from the previous generation, as always, adding a few
new clocks to the mix.

The number of gates now exceeds 32 and do not fit in a single register.
Unfortunately, designers chose to introduce the new gate register
immediately after the original one, at the beginning of the register
space, shifting all the master clock register offsets.

The sm1 also introduce a few mux and divider on the top clock path,
possibly to lower the peripheral clocks of the audio blocks if
necessary.
