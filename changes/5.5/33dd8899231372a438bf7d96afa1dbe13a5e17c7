drm/i915: cleanup cache-coloring

Try to tidy up the cache-coloring such that we rid the code of any
mm.color_adjust assumptions, this should hopefully make it more obvious
in the code when we need to actually use the cache-level as the color,
and as a bonus should make adding a different color-scheme simpler.
