ASoC: SOF: topology: free kcontrol memory on error

The volume and bytes kcontrols are currently not freeing their
memory on initialization failures. When an error occurs, all the
widgets loaded so far are unloaded via sof_widget_unload().
But this only happens for the widgets that got successfully loaded.

Fix that by kfree()-ing the allocated memory on load error.
