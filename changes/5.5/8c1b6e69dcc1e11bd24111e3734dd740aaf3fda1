bpf: Compare BTF types of functions arguments with actual types

Make the verifier check that BTF types of function arguments match actual types
passed into top-level BPF program and into BPF-to-BPF calls. If types match
such BPF programs and sub-programs will have full support of BPF trampoline. If
types mismatch the trampoline has to be conservative. It has to save/restore
five program arguments and assume 64-bit scalars.
