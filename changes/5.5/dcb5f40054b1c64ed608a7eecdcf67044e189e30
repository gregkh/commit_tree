selftests/bpf: Fix dependency ordering for attach_probe test

Current Makefile dependency chain is not strict enough and allows
test_attach_probe.o to be built before test_progs's
prog_test/attach_probe.o is built, which leads to assembler complaining
about missing included binary.

This patch is a minimal fix to fix this issue by enforcing that
test_attach_probe.o (BPF object file) is built before
prog_tests/attach_probe.c is attempted to be compiled.
