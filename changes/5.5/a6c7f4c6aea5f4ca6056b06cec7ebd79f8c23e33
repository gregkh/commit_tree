device-dax: Add a driver for "hmem" devices

Platform firmware like EFI/ACPI may publish "hmem" platform devices.
Such a device is a performance differentiated memory range likely
reserved for an application specific use case. The driver gives access
to 100% of the capacity via a device-dax mmap instance by default.

However, if over-subscription and other kernel memory management is
desired the resulting dax device can be assigned to the core-mm via the
kmem driver.

This consumes "hmem" devices the producer of "hmem" devices is saved for
a follow-on patch so that it can reference the new CONFIG_DEV_DAX_HMEM
symbol to gate performing the enumeration work.
