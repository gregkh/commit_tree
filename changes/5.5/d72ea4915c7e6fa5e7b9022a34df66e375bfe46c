powerpc/ima: Indicate kernel modules appended signatures are enforced

The arch specific kernel module policy rule requires kernel modules to
be signed, either as an IMA signature, stored as an xattr, or as an
appended signature. As a result, kernel modules appended signatures
could be enforced without "sig_enforce" being set or reflected in
/sys/module/module/parameters/sig_enforce. This patch sets
"sig_enforce".
