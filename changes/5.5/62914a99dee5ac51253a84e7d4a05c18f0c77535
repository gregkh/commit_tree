drm/amdgpu: Use mmu_interval_insert instead of hmm_mirror

Remove the interval tree in the driver and rely on the tree maintained by
the mmu_notifier for delivering mmu_notifier invalidation callbacks.

For some reason amdgpu has a very complicated arrangement where it tries
to prevent duplicate entries in the interval_tree, this is not necessary,
each amdgpu_bo can be its own stand alone entry. interval_tree already
allows duplicates and overlaps in the tree.

Also, there is no need to remove entries upon a release callback, the
mmu_interval API safely allows objects to remain registered beyond the
lifetime of the mm. The driver only has to stop touching the pages during
release.
