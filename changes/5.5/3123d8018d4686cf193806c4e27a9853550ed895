bpf: Add further test_verifier cases for record_func_key

Expand dummy prog generation such that we can easily check on return
codes and add few more test cases to make sure we keep on tracking
pruning behavior.

  # ./test_verifier
  [...]
  #1066/p XDP pkt read, pkt_data <= pkt_meta', bad access 1 OK
  #1067/p XDP pkt read, pkt_data <= pkt_meta', bad access 2 OK
  Summary: 1580 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED

Also verified that JIT dump of added test cases looks good.
