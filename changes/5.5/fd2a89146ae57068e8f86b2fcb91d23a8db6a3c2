net: macb: fix for fixed-link mode

This patch fix the issue with fixed link. With fixed-link
device opening fails due to macb_phylink_connect not
handling fixed-link mode, in which case no MAC-PHY connection
is needed and phylink_connect return success (0), however
in current driver attempt is made to search and connect to
PHY even for fixed-link.
