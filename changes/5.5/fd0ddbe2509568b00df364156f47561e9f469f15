Btrfs: send, skip backreference walking for extents with many references

Backreference walking, which is used by send to figure if it can issue
clone operations instead of write operations, can be very slow and use
too much memory when extents have many references. This change simply
skips backreference walking when an extent has more than 64 references,
in which case we fallback to a write operation instead of a clone
operation. This limit is conservative and in practice I observed no
signicant slowdown with up to 100 references and still low memory usage
up to that limit.

This is a temporary workaround until there are speedups in the backref
walking code, and as such it does not attempt to add extra interfaces or
knobs to tweak the threshold.
