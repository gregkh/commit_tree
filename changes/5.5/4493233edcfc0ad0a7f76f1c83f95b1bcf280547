io_uring: hook all linked requests via link_list

Links are created by chaining requests through req->list with an
exception that head uses req->link_list. (e.g. link_list->list->list)
Because of that, io_req_link_next() needs complex splicing to advance.

Link them all through list_list. Also, it seems to be simpler and more
consistent IMHO.
