xen/blkfront: Adjust indentation in xlvbd_alloc_gendisk

Clang warns:

../drivers/block/xen-blkfront.c:1117:4: warning: misleading indentation;
statement is not part of the previous 'if' [-Wmisleading-indentation]
                nr_parts = PARTS_PER_DISK;
                ^
../drivers/block/xen-blkfront.c:1115:3: note: previous statement is here
                if (err)
                ^

This is because there is a space at the beginning of this line; remove
it so that the indentation is consistent according to the Linux kernel
coding style and clang no longer warns.

While we are here, the previous line has some trailing whitespace; clean
that up as well.
