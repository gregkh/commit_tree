driver core: platform: use the correct callback type for bus_find_device

platform_find_device_by_driver calls bus_find_device and passes
platform_match as the callback function. Casting the function to a
mismatching type trips indirect call Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) checking.

This change adds a callback function with the correct type and instead
of casting the function, explicitly casts the second parameter to struct
device_driver* as expected by platform_match.
