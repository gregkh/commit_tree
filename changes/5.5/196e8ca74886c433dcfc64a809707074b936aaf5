bpf: Switch bpf_map_{area_alloc,area_mmapable_alloc}() to u64 size

Given we recently extended the original bpf_map_area_alloc() helper in
commit fc9702273e2e ("bpf: Add mmap() support for BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY"),
we need to apply the same logic as in ff1c08e1f74b ("bpf: Change size
to u64 for bpf_map_{area_alloc, charge_init}()"). To avoid conflicts,
extend it for bpf-next.
