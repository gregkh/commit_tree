io_uring: pass in 'sqe' to the prep handlers

This moves the prep handlers outside of the opcode handlers, and allows
us to pass in the sqe directly. If the sqe is non-NULL, it means that
the request should be prepared for the first time.

With the opcode handlers not having access to the sqe at all, we are
guaranteed that the prep handler has setup the request fully by the
time we get there. As before, for opcodes that need to copy in more
data then the io_kiocb allows for, the io_async_ctx holds that info. If
a prep handler is invoked with req->io set, it must use that to retain
information for later.

Finally, we can remove io_kiocb->sqe as well.
