kunit: test: add string_stream a std::stream like string builder

A number of test features need to do pretty complicated string printing
where it may not be possible to rely on a single preallocated string
with parameters.

So provide a library for constructing the string as you go similar to
C++'s std::string. string_stream is really just a string builder,
nothing more.
