Input: kxtj9 - switch to using polled mode of input devices

We have added polled mode to the normal input devices with the intent of
retiring input_polled_dev. This converts kxtj9 driver to use the polling
mode of standard input devices and removes dependency on INPUT_POLLDEV.

note that with regular input devices handling polling, there is no longer a
benefit in having separate INPUT_KXTJ9_POLLED_MODE config option.
