ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Fix work handling in delayed HP detection

CA0132 has the delayed HP jack detection code that is invoked from the
unsol handler, but it does a few weird things: it contains the cancel
of a work inside the work handler, and yet it misses the cancel-sync
call at (runtime-)suspend.  This patch addresses those issues.
