ACPI / PMIC: Add byt prefix to Crystal Cove PMIC OpRegion driver

Our current Crystal Cove OpRegion driver is only valid for the
Crystal Cove PMIC variant found on Bay Trail (BYT) boards,
Cherry Trail (CHT) based boards use another variant.

At least the regulator registers are different on CHT and these registers
are one of the things controlled by the custom PMIC OpRegion.

Commit 4d9ed62ab142 ("mfd: intel_soc_pmic: Export separate mfd-cell
configs for BYT and CHT") has disabled the intel_pmic_crc.c code for CHT
devices by removing the "crystal_cove_pmic" MFD cell on CHT devices.

This commit renames the intel_pmic_crc.c driver and the cell to be
prefixed with "byt" to indicate that this code is for BYT devices only.

This is a preparation patch for adding a separate PMIC OpRegion
driver for the CHT variant of the Crystal Cove PMIC (sometimes called
Crystal Cove Plus in Android kernel sources).
