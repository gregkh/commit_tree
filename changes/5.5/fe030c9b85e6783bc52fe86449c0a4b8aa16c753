powerpc/pseries/cmm: Implement balloon compaction

We can now get rid of the cmm_lock and completely rely on the balloon
compaction internals, which now also manage the page list and the
lock.

Inflated/"loaned" pages are now movable. Memory blocks that contain
such pages can get offlined. Also, all such pages will be marked
PageOffline() and can therefore be excluded in memory dumps using
recent versions of makedumpfile.

Don't switch to balloon_page_alloc() yet (due to the GFP_NOIO). Will
do that separately to discuss this change in detail.
