pinctrl: Add pinmux & GPIO controller driver for a new SoC

Intel Lightning Mountain SoC has a pinmux controller & GPIO controller IP which
controls pin multiplexing & configuration including GPIO functions selection &
GPIO attributes configuration.

This IP is not based on & does not have anything in common with Chassis
specification. The pinctrl drivers under pinctrl/intel/* are all based upon
Chassis spec compliant pinctrl IPs. So this driver doesn't fit & can not use
pinctrl framework under pinctrl/intel/* and it requires a separate new driver.

Add a new GPIO & pin control framework based driver for this IP.
