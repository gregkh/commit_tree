ARC: ARCv2: jump label: implement jump label patching

Implement jump label patching for ARC. Jump labels provide
an interface to generate dynamic branches using
self-modifying code.

This allows us to implement conditional branches where
changing branch direction is expensive but branch selection
is basically 'free'

This implementation uses 32-bit NOP and BRANCH instructions
which forced to be aligned by 4 to guarantee that they don't
cross L1 cache line boundary and can be update atomically.
