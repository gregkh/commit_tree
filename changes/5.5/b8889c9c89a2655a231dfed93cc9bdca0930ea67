rcu: Fix uninitialized variable in nocb_gp_wait()

We never set this to false.  This probably doesn't affect most people's
runtime because GCC will automatically initialize it to false at certain
common optimization levels.  But that behavior is related to a bug in
GCC and obviously should not be relied on.
