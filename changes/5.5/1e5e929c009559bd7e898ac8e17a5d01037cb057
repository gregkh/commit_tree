arm64: tegra: Fix 'active-low' warning for Jetson TX1 regulator

Commit 34993594181d ("arm64: tegra: Enable HDMI on Jetson TX1")
added a regulator for HDMI on the Jetson TX1 platform. This regulator
has an active high enable, but the GPIO specifier for enabling the
regulator incorrectly defines it as active-low. This causes the
following warning to occur on boot ...

 WARNING KERN regulator@10 GPIO handle specifies active low - ignored

The fixed-regulator binding does not use the active-low flag from the
gpio specifier and purely relies of the presence of the
'enable-active-high' property to determine if it is active high or low
(if this property is omitted). Fix this warning by setting the GPIO
to active-high in the GPIO specifier which aligns with the presense of
the 'enable-active-high' property.
