netfilter: arp_tables: init netns pointer in xt_tgchk_param struct

We get crash when the targets checkentry function tries to make
use of the network namespace pointer for arptables.

When the net pointer got added back in 2010, only ip/ip6/ebtables were
changed to initialize it, so arptables has this set to NULL.

This isn't a problem for normal arptables because no existing
arptables target has a checkentry function that makes use of par->net.

However, direct users of the setsockopt interface can provide any
target they want as long as its registered for ARP or UNPSEC protocols.

syzkaller managed to send a semi-valid arptables rule for RATEEST target
which is enough to trigger NULL deref:
