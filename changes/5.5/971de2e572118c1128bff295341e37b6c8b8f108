mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Fix use-after-free during reload

During reload (or module unload), the router block is de-initialized.
Among other things, this results in the removal of a default multicast
route from each active virtual router (VRF). These default routes are
configured during initialization to trap packets to the CPU. In
Spectrum-2, unlike Spectrum-1, multicast routes are implemented using
ACL rules.

Since the router block is de-initialized before the ACL block, it is
possible that the ACL rules corresponding to the default routes are
deleted while being accessed by the ACL delayed work that queries rules'
activity from the device. This can result in a rare use-after-free [1].

Fix this by protecting the rules list accessed by the delayed work with
a lock. We cannot use a spinlock as the activity read operation is
blocking.
