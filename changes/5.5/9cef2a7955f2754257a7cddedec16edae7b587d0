scsi: target: compare full CHAP_A Algorithm strings

RFC 2307 states:

  For CHAP [RFC1994], in the first step, the initiator MUST send:

      CHAP_A=<A1,A2...>

   Where A1,A2... are proposed algorithms, in order of preference.
...
   For the Algorithm, as stated in [RFC1994], one value is required to
   be implemented:

       5     (CHAP with MD5)

LIO currently checks for this value by only comparing a single byte in
the tokenized Algorithm string, which means that any value starting with
a '5' (e.g. "55") is interpreted as "CHAP with MD5". Fix this by
comparing the entire tokenized string.
