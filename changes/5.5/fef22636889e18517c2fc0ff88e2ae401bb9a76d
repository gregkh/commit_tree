usb: renesas_usbhs: enable DVSE interrupt

Commit [1] enabled the possibility of checking the DVST (Device State
Transition) bit of INTSTS0 (Interrupt Status Register 0) and calling
the irq_dev_state() handler if the DVST bit is set. But neither
commit [1] nor commit [2] actually enabled the DVSE (Device State
Transition Interrupt Enable) bit in the INTENB0 (Interrupt Enable
Register 0). As a consequence, irq_dev_state() handler is getting
called as a side effect of other (non-DVSE) interrupts being fired,
which definitely can't be relied upon, if DVST notifications are of
any value.

Why this doesn't hurt is because usbhsg_irq_dev_state() currently
doesn't do much except of a dev_dbg(). Once more work is added to
the handler (e.g. detecting device "Suspended" state and notifying
other USB gadget components about it), enabling DVSE becomes a hard
requirement. Do it in a standalone commit for better visibility and
clear explanation.
