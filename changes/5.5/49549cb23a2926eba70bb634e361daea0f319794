iio: adis16480: Fix scales factors

This patch fixes the scales for the gyroscope, accelerometer and
barometer. The pressure scale was just wrong. For the others, the scale
factors were not taking into account that a 32bit word is being read
from the device.

Fixes: 82e7a1b25017 ("iio: imu: adis16480: Add support for ADIS1649x family of devices")
