rcutorture: Emulate dyntick aspect of userspace nohz_full sojourn

During an actual call_rcu() flood, there would be frequent trips to
userspace (in-kernel call_rcu() floods must be otherwise housebroken).
Userspace execution on nohz_full CPUs implies an RCU dyntick idle/not-idle
transition pair, so this commit adds emulation of that pair.
