selftests/bps: Clean up removed ints relocations negative tests

As part of 42765ede5c54 ("selftests/bpf: Remove too strict field offset relo
test cases"), few ints relocations negative (supposed to fail) tests were
removed, but not completely. Due to them being negative, some leftovers in
prog_tests/core_reloc.c went unnoticed. Clean them up.
