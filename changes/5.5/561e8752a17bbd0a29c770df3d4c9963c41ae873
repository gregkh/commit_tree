octeontx2-af: Enable broadcast packet replication

Ingress packet replication support has been added to 96xx B0
silicon. This patch enables using that feature to replicate
ingress broadcast packets to PF and it's VFs.

Also fixed below issues
- VFs can also install NPC MCAM entry to forward broadcast pkts.
  Otherwise, unless PF's interface is UP, VFs will not receive
  bcast packets.
- NPC MCAM entry is disabled when PF and all it's VFs are down.
- Few corner cases in installing multicast entry list.
