clk: sunxi-ng: v3s: Fix incorrect number of hw_clks.

The hws field of sun8i_v3s_hw_clks has only 74
members. However, the number specified by CLK_NUMBER
is 77 (= CLK_I2S0 + 1). This leads to runtime segmentation
fault that is not always reproducible.

This patch fixes the problem by specifying correct clock number.
