perf/x86/intel: Fix PT PMI handling

Commit:

  ccbebba4c6bf ("perf/x86/intel/pt: Bypass PT vs. LBR exclusivity if the core supports it")

skips the PT/LBR exclusivity check on CPUs where PT and LBRs coexist, but
also inadvertently skips the active_events bump for PT in that case, which
is a bug. If there aren't any hardware events at the same time as PT, the
PMI handler will ignore PT PMIs, as active_events reads zero in that case,
resulting in the "Uhhuh" spurious NMI warning and PT data loss.

Fix this by always increasing active_events for PT events.
