powerpc/xive: Prevent page fault issues in the machine crash handler

When the machine crash handler is invoked, all interrupts are masked
but interrupts which have not been started yet do not have an ESB page
mapped in the Linux address space. This crashes the 'crash kexec'
sequence on sPAPR guests.

To fix, force the mapping of the ESB page when an interrupt is being
mapped in the Linux IRQ number space. This is done by setting the
initial state of the interrupt to OFF which is not necessarily the
case on PowerNV.
