xtensa: use MEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ANYWHERE for KASAN shadow map

KASAN shadow map doesn't need to be accessible through the linear kernel
mapping, allocate its pages with MEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ANYWHERE so that high
memory can be used. This frees up to ~100MB of low memory on xtensa
configurations with KASAN and high memory.
