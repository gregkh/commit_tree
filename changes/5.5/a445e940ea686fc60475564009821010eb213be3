dma-mapping: fix handling of dma-ranges for reserved memory (again)

Daniele reported that issue previously fixed in c41f9ea998f3
("drivers: dma-coherent: Account dma_pfn_offset when used with device
tree") reappear shortly after 43fc509c3efb ("dma-coherent: introduce
interface for default DMA pool") where fix was accidentally dropped.

Lets put fix back in place and respect dma-ranges for reserved memory.

Fixes: 43fc509c3efb ("dma-coherent: introduce interface for default DMA pool")
