mm/mmu_notifier: define the header pre-processor parts even if disabled

Now that we have KERNEL_HEADER_TEST all headers are generally compile
tested, so relying on makefile tricks to avoid compiling code that depends
on CONFIG_MMU_NOTIFIER is more annoying.

Instead follow the usual pattern and provide most of the header with only
the functions stubbed out when CONFIG_MMU_NOTIFIER is disabled. This
ensures code compiles no matter what the config setting is.

While here, struct mmu_notifier_mm is private to mmu_notifier.c, move it.
