s390: correct CALL_ON_STACK back_chain saving

Currently CALL_ON_STACK saves r15 as back_chain in the first stack frame of
the stack we about to switch to. But if a function which uses CALL_ON_STACK
calls other function it allocates a stack frame for a callee. In this
case r15 is pointing to a callee stack frame and not a stack frame of
function itself. This results in dummy unwinding entry with random
sp and ip values.

Introduce and utilize current_frame_address macro to get an address of
actual function stack frame.
