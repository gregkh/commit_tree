PM / devfreq: Introduce get_freq_range helper

Moving handling of min/max freq to a single function and call it from
update_devfreq and for printing min/max freq values in sysfs.

This changes the behavior of out-of-range min_freq/max_freq: clamping
is now done at evaluation time. This means that if an out-of-range
constraint is imposed by sysfs and it later becomes valid then it will
be enforced.
