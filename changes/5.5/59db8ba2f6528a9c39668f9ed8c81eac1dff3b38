block: still try to split bio if the bvec crosses pages

Some device may set segment boundary as PAGE_SIZE - 1. If the bvec
crosses pages, and meantime its length is <= PAGE_SIZE, we still need
to split the bvec into 2 segments.

Fixes this issue by still splitting bio if the single bvec crosses
pages.
