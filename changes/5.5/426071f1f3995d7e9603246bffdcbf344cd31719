tipc: reduce sensitive to retransmit failures

With huge cluster (e.g >200nodes), the amount of that flow:
gap -> retransmit packet -> acked will take time in case of STATE_MSG
dropped/delayed because a lot of traffic. This lead to 1.5 sec tolerance
value criteria made link easy failure around 2nd, 3rd of failed
retransmission attempts.

Instead of re-introduced criteria of 99 faled retransmissions to fix the
issue, we increase failure detection timer to ten times tolerance value.
