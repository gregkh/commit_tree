drm/i915: Limit audio CDCLK>=2*BCLK constraint back to GLK only

Revert changes done in commit f6ec9483091f ("drm/i915: extend audio
CDCLK>=2*BCLK constraint to more platforms"). Audio drivers
communicate with i915 over HDA bus multiple times during system
boot-up and each of these transactions result in matching
get_power/put_power calls to i915, and depending on the platform,
a modeset change causing visible flicker.

GLK is the only platform with minimum CDCLK significantly lower
than BCLK, and thus for GLK setting a higher CDCLK is mandatory.

For other platforms, minimum CDCLK is close but below 2*BCLK
(e.g. on ICL, CDCLK=176.4kHz with BCLK=96kHz). Spec-wise the constraint
should be set, but in practise no communication errors have been
reported and the downside if set is the flicker observed at boot-time.

Revert to old behaviour until better mechanism to manage
probe-time clocks is available.

The full CDCLK>=2*BCLK constraint is still enforced at pipe
enable time in intel_crtc_compute_min_cdclk().
