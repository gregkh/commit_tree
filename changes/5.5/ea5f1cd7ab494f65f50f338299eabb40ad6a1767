x86/ioperm: Remove bitmap if all permissions dropped

If ioperm() results in a bitmap with all bits set (no permissions to any
I/O port), then handling that bitmap on context switch and exit to user
mode is pointless. Drop it.

Move the bitmap exit handling to the ioport code and reuse it for both the
thread exit path and dropping it. This allows to reuse this code for the
upcoming iopl() emulation.
