rtlwifi: fix memory leak in rtl92c_set_fw_rsvdpagepkt()

This leak was found by testing the EDIMAX EW-7612 on Raspberry Pi 3B+ with
Linux 5.4-rc5 (multi_v7_defconfig + rtlwifi + kmemleak) and noticed a
single memory leak during probe:

unreferenced object 0xec13ee40 (size 176):
  comm "kworker/u8:1", pid 36, jiffies 4294939321 (age 5580.790s)

It is because 8192cu doesn't implement usb_cmd_send_packet(), and this
patch just frees the skb within the function to resolve memleak problem
by now. Since 8192cu doesn't turn on fwctrl_lps that needs to download
command packet for firmware via the function, applying this patch doesn't
affect driver behavior.
