bcache: fix fifo index swapping condition in journal_pin_cmp()

Fifo structure journal.pin is implemented by a cycle buffer, if the back
index reaches highest location of the cycle buffer, it will be swapped
to 0. Once the swapping happens, it means a smaller fifo index might be
associated to a newer journal entry. So the btree node with oldest
journal entry won't be selected in bch_btree_leaf_dirty() to reference
the dirty B+tree leaf node. This problem may cause bcache journal won't
protect unflushed oldest B+tree dirty leaf node in power failure, and
this B+tree leaf node is possible to beinconsistent after reboot from
power failure.

This patch fixes the fifo index comparing logic in journal_pin_cmp(),
to avoid potential corrupted B+tree leaf node when the back index of
journal pin is swapped.
