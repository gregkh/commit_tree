net/smc: abnormal termination of SMCD link groups

A final cleanup due to SMCD device removal means immediate freeing
of all link groups belonging to this device in interrupt context.

This patch introduces a separate SMCD link group termination routine,
which terminates all link groups of an SMCD device.

This new routine smcd_terminate_all ()is reused if the smc module is
unloaded.
