spi: orion: fix runtime PM initialization

The current initialisation of runtime PM in the orion-spi.c driver is
incorrect, because calling pm_runtime_put_autosuspend before calling
pm_runtime_get leads to a negative value of the reference count and
therefore it sometimes causes suspend during a transmission.
