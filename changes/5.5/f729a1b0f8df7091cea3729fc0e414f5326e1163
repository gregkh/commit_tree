Input: input_event - fix struct padding on sparc64

Going through all uses of timeval, I noticed that we screwed up
input_event in the previous attempts to fix it:

The time fields now match between kernel and user space, but all following
fields are in the wrong place.

Add the required padding that is implied by the glibc timeval definition
to fix the layout, and use a struct initializer to avoid leaking kernel
stack data.

Fixes: 2e746942ebac ("Input: input_event - provide override for sparc64")
