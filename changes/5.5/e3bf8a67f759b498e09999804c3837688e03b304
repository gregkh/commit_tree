arm64: insn: add encoder for MOV (register)

For FTRACE_WITH_REGS, we're going to want to generate a MOV (register)
instruction as part of the callsite intialization. As MOV (register) is
an alias for ORR (shifted register), we can generate this with
aarch64_insn_gen_logical_shifted_reg(), but it's somewhat verbose and
difficult to read in-context.

Add a aarch64_insn_gen_move_reg() wrapper for this case so that we can
write callers in a more straightforward way.
