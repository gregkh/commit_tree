net: add __sys_connect_file() helper

This is identical to __sys_connect(), except it takes a struct file
instead of an fd, and it also allows passing in extra file->f_flags
flags. The latter is done to support masking in O_NONBLOCK without
manipulating the original file flags.

No functional changes in this patch.
