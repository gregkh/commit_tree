ftrace: Introduce PERMANENT ftrace_ops flag

Livepatch uses ftrace for redirection to new patched functions. It means
that if ftrace is disabled, all live patched functions are disabled as
well. Toggling global 'ftrace_enabled' sysctl thus affect it directly.
It is not a problem per se, because only administrator can set sysctl
values, but it still may be surprising.

Introduce PERMANENT ftrace_ops flag to amend this. If the
FTRACE_OPS_FL_PERMANENT is set on any ftrace ops, the tracing cannot be
disabled by disabling ftrace_enabled. Equally, a callback with the flag
set cannot be registered if ftrace_enabled is disabled.
