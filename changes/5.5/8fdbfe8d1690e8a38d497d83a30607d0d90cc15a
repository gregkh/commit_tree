dm clone metadata: Use a two phase commit

Split the metadata commit in two parts:

1. dm_clone_metadata_pre_commit(): Prepare the current transaction for
   committing. After this is called, all subsequent metadata updates,
   done through either dm_clone_set_region_hydrated() or
   dm_clone_cond_set_range(), will be part of the next transaction.

2. dm_clone_metadata_commit(): Actually commit the current transaction
   to disk and start a new transaction.

This is required by the following commit. It allows dm-clone to flush
the destination device after step (1) to ensure that all freshly
hydrated regions, for which we are updating the metadata, are properly
written to non-volatile storage and won't be lost in case of a crash.
