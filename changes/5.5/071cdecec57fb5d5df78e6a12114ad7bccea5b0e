xdp: Fix cleanup on map free for devmap_hash map type

Tetsuo pointed out that it was not only the device unregister hook that was
broken for devmap_hash types, it was also cleanup on map free. So better
fix this as well.

While we're at it, there's no reason to allocate the netdev_map array for
DEVMAP_HASH, so skip that and adjust the cost accordingly.
