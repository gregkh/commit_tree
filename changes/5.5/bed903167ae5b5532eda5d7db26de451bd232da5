arm64: dts: exynos: Revert "Remove unneeded address space mapping for soc node"

Commit ef72171b3621 ("arm64: dts: exynos: Remove unneeded address space
mapping for soc node") changed the address and size cells in root node from
2 to 1, but /memory nodes for the affected boards were not updated. This
went unnoticed on Exynos5433-based TM2(e) boards, because they use u-boot,
which updates /memory node to the correct values. On the other hand, the
mentioned commit broke boot on Exynos7-based Espresso board, which
bootloader doesn't touch /memory node at all.

This patch reverts commit ef72171b3621 ("arm64: dts: exynos: Remove
unneeded address space mapping for soc node"), so Exynos5433 and Exynos7
SoCs again matches other ARM64 platforms with 64bit mappings in root
node.
