driver core: Allow a device to wait on optional suppliers

Before this change, if a device is waiting on suppliers, it's assumed
that all those suppliers are needed for the device to probe
successfully. This change allows marking a devices as waiting only on
optional suppliers. This allows a device to wait on suppliers (and link
to them as soon as they are available) without preventing the device
from being probed.
