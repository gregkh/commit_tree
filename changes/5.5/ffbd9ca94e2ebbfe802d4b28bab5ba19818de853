net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix corner-case checks in TX resync flow

There are the following cases:

1. Packet ends before start marker: bypass offload.
2. Packet starts before start marker and ends after it: drop,
   not supported, breaks contract with kernel.
3. packet ends before tls record info starts: drop,
   this packet was already acknowledged and its record info
   was released.

Add the above as comment in code.

Mind possible wraparounds of the TCP seq, replace the simple comparison
with a call to the TCP before() method.

In addition, remove logic that handles negative sync_len values,
as it became impossible.
