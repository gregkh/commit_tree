arm64: dts: renesas: Add LIF channel indices to vsps properties

According to the Renesas R-Car DU bindings documentation, the 'vsps'
property should be composed of a phandle to the VSP instance and the
index of the LIF channel assigned to the DU channel. Some SoC device
tree source files do not specify any LIF channel index, relying on the
driver defaulting to 0 if not specified.

Align all device tree files by specifying the LIF channel indices as
prescribed by the bindings documentation.
