fs/proc/internal.h: shuffle "struct pde_opener"

List iteration takes more code than anything else which means embedded
list_head should be the first element of the structure.

Space savings:

	add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/4 up/down: 0/-18 (-18)
	Function                                     old     new   delta
	close_pdeo                                   228     227      -1
	proc_reg_release                              86      82      -4
	proc_entry_rundown                           143     139      -4
	proc_reg_open                                298     289      -9
