ARC: mm: remove __ARCH_USE_5LEVEL_HACK

Patch series "elide extraneous generated code for folded p4d/pud/pmd", v3.

This series came out of seemingly benign excursion into
understanding/removing __ARCH_USE_5LEVEL_HACK from ARC port showing some
extraneous code being generated despite folded p4d/pud/pmd

| bloat-o-meter2 vmlinux-[AB]*
| add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 3/0 up/down: 130/0 (130)
| function                                     old     new   delta
| free_pgd_range                               548     660    +112
| p4d_clear_bad                                  2      20     +18

The patches here address that

| bloat-o-meter2 vmlinux-[BF]*
| add/remove: 0/2 grow/shrink: 0/1 up/down: 0/-386 (-386)
| function                                     old     new   delta
| pud_clear_bad                                 20       -     -20
| p4d_clear_bad                                 20       -     -20
| free_pgd_range                               660     314    -346

The code savings are not a whole lot, but still worthwhile IMHO.

This patch (of 5):

With paging code made 5-level compliant, this is no longer needed.  ARC
has software page walker with 2 lookup levels (pgd -> pte)

This was expected to be non functional change but ended with slight
code bloat due to needless inclusions of p*d_free_tlb() macros which
will be addressed in further patches.
