pinctrl: aspeed-g6: Fix LPC/eSPI mux configuration

Early revisions of the AST2600 datasheet are conflicted about the state
of the LPC/eSPI strapping bit (SCU510[6]). Conversations with ASPEED
determined that the reference pinmux configuration tables were in error
and the SCU documentation contained the correct configuration. Update
the driver to reflect the state described in the SCU documentation.
