icmp: remove duplicate code

The same code which recognizes ICMP error packets is duplicated several
times. Use the icmp_is_err() and icmpv6_is_err() helpers instead, which
do the same thing.

ip_multipath_l3_keys() and tcf_nat_act() didn't check for all the error types,
assume that they should instead.
