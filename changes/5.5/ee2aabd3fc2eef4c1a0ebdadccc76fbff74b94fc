tcp: refine tcp_write_queue_empty() implementation

Due to how tcp_sendmsg() is implemented, we can have an empty
skb at the tail of the write queue.

Most [1] tcp_write_queue_empty() callers want to know if there is
anything to send (payload and/or FIN)

Instead of checking if the sk_write_queue is empty, we need
to test if tp->write_seq == tp->snd_nxt

[1] tcp_send_fin() was the only caller that expected to
 see if an skb was in the write queue, I have changed the code
 to reuse the tcp_write_queue_tail() result.
