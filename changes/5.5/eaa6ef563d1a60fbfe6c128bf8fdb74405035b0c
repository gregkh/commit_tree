rtc: interface: use timeu64_t for range_max

For rtc drivers where rtc->range_max is set U64_MAX, like the PS3 rtc,
rtc_valid_range() always returns -ERANGE. This is because the local
variable range_max has type time64_t, so the test
	if (time < range_min || time > range_max)
		return -ERANGE;
becomes (time < range_min || time > -1), which always evaluates to true.
timeu64_t should be used, since it's the type of rtc->range_max.
