rcu: Force nohz_full tick on upon irq enter instead of exit

There is interrupt-exit code that forces on the tick for nohz_full CPUs
failing to respond to the current grace period in a timely fashion.
However, this code must compare ->dynticks_nmi_nesting to the value 2
in the interrupt-exit fastpath.  This commit therefore moves this code
to the interrupt-entry fastpath, where a lighter-weight comparison to
zero may be used.
