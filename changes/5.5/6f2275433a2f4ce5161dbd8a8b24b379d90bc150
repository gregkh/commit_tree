ibmveth: Detect unsupported packets before sending to the hypervisor

Currently, when ibmveth receive a loopback packet, it reports an
ambiguous error message "tx: h_send_logical_lan failed with rc=-4"
because the hypervisor rejects those types of packets. This fix
detects loopback packet and assures the source packet's MAC address
matches the driver's MAC address before transmitting to the
hypervisor.
