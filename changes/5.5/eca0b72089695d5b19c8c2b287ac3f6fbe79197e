drm/i915: Do initial mocs configuration directly

Now that we record the default "goldenstate" context, we do not need to
emit the mocs registers at the start of each context and can simply do
mmio before the first context and capture the registers as part of its
default image. As a consequence, this means that we repeat the mmio
after each engine reset, fixing up any platform and registers that were
zapped by the reset (for those platforms with global not context-saved
settings).
