scsi: lpfc: Add FC-AL support to lpe32000 models

In the past, the lpe32000 models, based their main support being for 32G,
and as FC-AL is not supported in the FC standards past 8G, did not support
FC-AL operation.

This patch adds private-loop FC-AL support for the LPE32000 adapters
when a link is 8G or below. To avoid conditions where link rate may
change, which would cause non-connectivity to the AL device, FC-AL
mode must become a persistent setting and the link kept at a speed
supporting FC-AL.

The patch:

 - Adds a pls attribute indicating whether the adapter properly supports
   FC-AL.

 - Adds support for the adapter to indicate that topology should be fixed
   and the topology types to be configured.

 - Adds a pt attribute to report the persistent topology if present.
