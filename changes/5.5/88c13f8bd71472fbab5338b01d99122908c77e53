selftests/seccomp: Zero out seccomp_notif

The seccomp_notif structure should be zeroed out prior to calling the
SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_RECV ioctl. Previously, the kernel did not check
whether these structures were zeroed out or not, so these worked.

This patch zeroes out the seccomp_notif data structure prior to calling
the ioctl.
