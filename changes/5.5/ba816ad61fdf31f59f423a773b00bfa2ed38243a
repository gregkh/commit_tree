io_uring: run dependent links inline if possible

Currently any dependent link is executed from a new workqueue context,
which means that we'll be doing a context switch per link in the chain.
If we are running the completion of the current request from our async
workqueue and find that the next request is a link, then run it directly
from the workqueue context instead of forcing another switch.

This improves the performance of linked SQEs, and reduces the CPU
overhead.
