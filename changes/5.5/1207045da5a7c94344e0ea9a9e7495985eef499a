compat_ioctl: move tape handling into drivers

MTIOCPOS and MTIOCGET are incompatible between 32-bit and 64-bit user
space, and traditionally have been translated in fs/compat_ioctl.c.

To get rid of that translation handler, move a corresponding
implementation into each of the four drivers implementing those commands.

The interesting part of that is now in a new linux/mtio.h header that
wraps the existing uapi/linux/mtio.h header and provides an abstraction
to let drivers handle both cases easily. Using an in_compat_syscall()
check, the caller does not have to keep track of whether this was
called through .unlocked_ioctl() or .compat_ioctl().
