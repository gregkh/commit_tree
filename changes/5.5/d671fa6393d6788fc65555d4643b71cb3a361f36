kselftests: cgroup: Avoid the reuse of fd after it is deallocated

It is necessary to set fd to -1 when inotify_add_watch() fails in
cg_prepare_for_wait. Otherwise the fd which has been closed in
cg_prepare_for_wait may be misused in other functions such as
cg_enter_and_wait_for_frozen and cg_freeze_wait.
