pwm: stm32: Split breakinput apply routine to ease PM support

Split breakinput routine that configures STM32 timers 'break' safety
feature upon probe, into two routines:
- stm32_pwm_apply_breakinputs() sets all the break inputs into registers.
- stm32_pwm_probe_breakinputs() probes the device tree break input settings
  before calling stm32_pwm_apply_breakinputs()

This is a precursor patch to ease PM support. Registers content may get
lost during low power. So, break input settings applied upon probe need
to be restored upon resume (e.g. by calling stm32_pwm_apply_breakinputs()).
