ath10k: Add peer param map for tlv and non-tlv

The peer param id for PEER_PARAM_USE_FIXED_PWR
is different for tlv and non-tlv firmware. This
causes incorrect peer param to be set by the driver
to the firmware(tlv/non-tlv).

Create seperate peer param map for tlv and non-tlv
firmware and attach the peer param id based on the
firmware type during the init.
