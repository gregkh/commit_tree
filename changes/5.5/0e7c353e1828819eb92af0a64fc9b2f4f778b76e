scsi: pm80xx: fix logic to break out of loop when register value is 2 or 3

The condition (reg_val != 2) || (reg_val != 3) will always be true because
reg_val cannot be equal to two different values at the same time. Fix this
by replacing the || operator with && so that the loop will loop if reg_val
is not a 2 and not a 3 as was originally intended.
