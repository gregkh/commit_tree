flow_dissector: extract more ICMP information

The ICMP flow dissector currently parses only the Type and Code fields.
Some ICMP packets (echo, timestamp) have a 16 bit Identifier field which
is used to correlate packets.
Add such field in flow_dissector_key_icmp and replace skb_flow_get_be16()
with a more complex function which populate this field.
