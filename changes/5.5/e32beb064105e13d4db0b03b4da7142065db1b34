cpufreq: vexpress-spc: find and skip duplicates when merging frequencies

Currently the cpufreq core aborts the validation and return error
immediately when it encounter duplicate frequency table entries.
This change was introduced long back since commit da0c6dc00c69
("cpufreq: Handle sorted frequency tables more efficiently").

However, this missed the testing with modified firmware for long time.
Inorder to make it work with default settings, we need to ensure the
merged table for bL switcher contains no duplicates. Find the duplicates
and skip them when merging the frequenct tables of A15 and A7 clusters.
