drm/i915: Remove hdcp2_hdmi_msg_timeout.timeout2

The only reason for the timeout2 value in the array is the
HDCP_2_2_AKE_SEND_HPRIME message. But that one still needs
special casing inside the loop, and so just ends up making
the code harder to read. Let's just remove this leaky
timeout2 abstraction and special case that one command
in a way that is easy to understand. We can then remove the
timeout2 member from struct entirely.
