ARM: shmobile: defconfig: Restore debugfs support

Since commit 0e4a459f56c32d3e ("tracing: Remove unnecessary DEBUG_FS
dependency"), CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is no longer auto-enabled.  This breaks
booting Debian 9, as systemd needs debugfs:

    [FAILED] Failed to mount /sys/kernel/debug.
    See 'systemctl status sys-kernel-debug.mount' for details.
    [DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local File Systems.
    ...
    You are in emergGive root password for maintenance
    (or press Control-D to continue):

Fix this by enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_FS explicitly.

debugfs support").
