samples/bpf: adjust Makefile and README.rst

Side effect of some kbuild changes resulted in breaking the
documented way to build samples/bpf/.

This patch change the samples/bpf/Makefile to work again, when
invoking make from the subdir samples/bpf/. Also update the
documentation in README.rst, to reflect the new way to build.
