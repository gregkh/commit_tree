dt-bindings: gpu: mali-midgard: Tidy up conversion to YAML

Instead of grouping alphabetically by third-party vendor, leading to
one-element enums, start sorting by Mali model number, as done for
Utgard.

This already allows us to de-duplicate two "arm,mali-t760" sections and
will make it easier to add new vendor compatibles.
