spi: Don't look at TX buffer for PTP system timestamping

The API for PTP system timestamping (associating a SPI transaction with
the system time at which it was transferred) is flawed: it assumes that
the xfer->tx_buf pointer will always be present.

This is, of course, not always the case.

So introduce a "progress" variable that denotes how many word have been
transferred.

Fix the Freescale DSPI driver, the only user of the API so far, in the
same patch.
