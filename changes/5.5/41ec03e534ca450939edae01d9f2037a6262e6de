cxgb4: check rule prio conflicts before offload

Only offload rule if it satisfies both of the following conditions:
1. The immediate previous rule has priority <= current rule's priority.
2. The immediate next rule has priority >= current rule's priority.

Also rework free entry fetch logic to search from end of TCAM, instead
of beginning, because higher indices have lower priority than lower
indices. This is similar to how TC auto generates priority values.

v5:
- Fixed commit message and comment to include comparison for equal
  priority.

v4:
- Patch added in this version.
