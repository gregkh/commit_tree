livepatch: Keep replaced patches until post_patch callback is called

Pre/post (un)patch callbacks might manipulate the system state. Cumulative
livepatches might need to take over the changes made by the replaced
ones. For this they might need to access some data stored or referenced
by the old livepatches.

Therefore the replaced livepatches have to stay around until post_patch()
callback is called. It is achieved by calling the free functions later.
It is the same location where disabled livepatches have already been
freed.
