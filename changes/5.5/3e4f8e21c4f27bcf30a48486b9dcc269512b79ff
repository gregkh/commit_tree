USB: core: fix check for duplicate endpoints

Amend the endpoint-descriptor sanity checks to detect all duplicate
endpoint addresses in a configuration.

Commit 0a8fd1346254 ("USB: fix problems with duplicate endpoint
addresses") added a check for duplicate endpoint addresses within a
single alternate setting, but did not look for duplicate addresses in
other interfaces.

The current check would also not detect all duplicate addresses when one
endpoint is as a (bi-directional) control endpoint.

This specifically avoids overwriting the endpoint entries in struct
usb_device when enabling a duplicate endpoint, something which could
potentially lead to crashes or leaks, for example, when endpoints are
later disabled.
