nl80211: Document the expectation for NL80211_ATTR_IE in NL80211_CMD_CONNECT

This commit documents the expectation for NL80211_ATTR_IE when included
in NL80211_CMD_CONNECT, as following.

Driver shall not modify the IEs specified through NL80211_ATTR_IE if
NL80211_ATTR_MAC is included. However, if NL80211_ATTR_MAC_HINT is
included, these IEs through NL80211_ATTR_IE are specified by the user
space based on the best possible BSS selected. Thus, if the driver ends
up selecting a different BSS, it can modify these IEs accordingly (e.g.
userspace asks the driver to perform PMKSA caching with BSS1 and the
driver ends up selecting BSS2 with different PMKSA cache entry. RSNIE
has to get updated with the apt PMKID).
