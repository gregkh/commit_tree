ftrace: Separate out functionality from ftrace_location_range()

Create a new function called lookup_rec() from the functionality of
ftrace_location_range(). The difference between lookup_rec() is that it
returns the record that it finds, where as ftrace_location_range() returns
only if it found a match or not.

The lookup_rec() is static, and can be used for new functionality where
ftrace needs to find a record of a specific address.
