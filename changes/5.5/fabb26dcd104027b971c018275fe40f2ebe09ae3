ALSA: pcm: Add card sync_irq field

Many PCI and other drivers performs snd_pcm_period_elapsed() simply in
its interrupt handler, so the sync_stop operation is just to call
synchronize_irq().  Instead of putting this call multiple times,
introduce the common card->sync_irq field.  When this field is set,
PCM core performs synchronize_irq() for sync-stop operation.  Each
driver just needs to copy its local IRQ number to card->sync_irq, and
that's all we need.
