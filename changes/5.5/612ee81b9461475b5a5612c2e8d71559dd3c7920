powerpc/papr_scm: Fix an off-by-one check in papr_scm_meta_{get, set}

A validation check to prevent out of bounds read/write inside
functions papr_scm_meta_{get,set}() is off-by-one that prevent reads
and writes to the last byte of the label area.

This bug manifests as a failure to probe a dimm when libnvdimm is
unable to read the entire config-area as advertised by
ND_CMD_GET_CONFIG_SIZE. This usually happens when there are large
number of namespaces created in the region backed by the dimm and the
label-index spans max possible config-area. An error of the form below
usually reported in the kernel logs:

[  255.293912] nvdimm: probe of nmem0 failed with error -22

The patch fixes these validation checks there by letting libnvdimm
access the entire config-area.
