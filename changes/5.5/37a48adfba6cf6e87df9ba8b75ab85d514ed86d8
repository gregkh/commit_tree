drm/vram: Add kmap ref-counting to GEM VRAM objects

The kmap and kunmap operations of GEM VRAM buffers can now be called
in interleaving pairs. The first call to drm_gem_vram_kmap() maps the
buffer's memory to kernel address space and the final call to
drm_gem_vram_kunmap() unmaps the memory. Intermediate calls to these
functions increment or decrement a reference counter.

This change allows for keeping buffer memory mapped for longer and
minimizes the amount of changes to TLB, page tables, etc.

v4:
	* lock in kmap()/kunmap() with ttm_bo_reserve()
