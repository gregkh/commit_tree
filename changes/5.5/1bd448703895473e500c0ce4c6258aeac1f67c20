net: dsa: sja1105: Rename sja1105_spi_send_packed_buf to sja1105_xfer_buf

The most commonly called function in the driver is long due for a
rename. The "packed" word is redundant (it doesn't make sense to
transfer an unpacked structure, since that is in CPU endianness yadda
yadda), and the "spi" word is also redundant since argument 2 of the
function is SPI_READ or SPI_WRITE.

As for the sja1105_spi_send_long_packed_buf function, it is only being
used from sja1105_spi.c, so remove its global prototype.
