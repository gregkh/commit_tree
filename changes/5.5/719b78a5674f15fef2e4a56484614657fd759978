flow_dissector: Allow updating the flow dissector program atomically

It is currently not possible to detach the flow dissector program and
attach a new one in an atomic fashion, that is with a single syscall.
Attempts to do so will be met with EEXIST error.

This makes updates to flow dissector program hard. Traffic steering that
relies on BPF-powered flow dissection gets disrupted while old program has
been already detached but the new one has not been attached yet.

There is also a window of opportunity to attach a flow dissector to a
non-root namespace while updating the root flow dissector, thus blocking
the update.

Lastly, the behavior is inconsistent with cgroup BPF programs, which can be
replaced with a single bpf(BPF_PROG_ATTACH, ...) syscall without any
restrictions.

Allow attaching a new flow dissector program when another one is already
present with a restriction that it can't be the same program.
