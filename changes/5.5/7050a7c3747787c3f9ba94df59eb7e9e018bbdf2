backlight: ipaq_micro: Make structure micro_bl_props constant

Static structure micro_bl_props, having type backlight_properties, is
used only once, when it is passed as the last argument to function
devm_backlight_device_register(). devm_backlight_device_register() is
defined with its last parameter being declared constant. Hence make
micro_bl_props itself constant as well.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
