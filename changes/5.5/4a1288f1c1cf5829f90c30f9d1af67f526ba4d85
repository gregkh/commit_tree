dell-smm-hwmon: Add documentation

Part of the documentation is taken from the README of the userspace
utils (https://github.com/vitorafsr/i8kutils). The license is GPL-2+
and the author Massimo Dal Zotto is already credited as author of
the module. Therefore there should be no copyright problem.

I also added a paragraph with specific information on the experimental
support for automatic BIOS fan control.
