KVM: x86: Prevent set vCPU into INIT/SIPI_RECEIVED state when INIT are latched

Commit 4b9852f4f389 ("KVM: x86: Fix INIT signal handling in various CPU states")
fixed KVM to also latch pending LAPIC INIT event when vCPU is in VMX
operation.

However, current API of KVM_SET_MP_STATE allows userspace to put vCPU
into KVM_MP_STATE_SIPI_RECEIVED or KVM_MP_STATE_INIT_RECEIVED even when
vCPU is in VMX operation.

Fix this by introducing a util method to check if vCPU state latch INIT
signals and use it in KVM_SET_MP_STATE handler.
