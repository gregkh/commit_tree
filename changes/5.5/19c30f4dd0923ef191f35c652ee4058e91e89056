XArray: Fix xa_find_after with multi-index entries

If the entry is of an order which is a multiple of XA_CHUNK_SIZE,
the current detection of sibling entries does not work.  Factor out
an xas_sibling() function to make xa_find_after() a little more
understandable, and write a new implementation that doesn't suffer from
the same bug.
