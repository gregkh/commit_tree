x86/ftrace: Get rid of function_hook

History lesson courtesy of Steve:

"When ftrace first was introduced to the kernel, it used gcc's
mcount profiling mechanism. The mcount mechanism would add a call to
"mcount" at the start of every function but after the stack frame was
set up. Later, in gcc 4.6, gcc introduced -mfentry, that would create a
call to "__fentry__" instead of "mcount", before the stack frame was
set up. In order to handle both cases, ftrace defined a macro
"function_hook" that would be either "mcount" or "__fentry__" depending
on which one was being used.

The Linux kernel no longer supports the "mcount" method, thus there's
no reason to keep the "function_hook" define around. Simply use
"__fentry__", as there is no ambiguity to the name anymore."

Drop it everywhere.
