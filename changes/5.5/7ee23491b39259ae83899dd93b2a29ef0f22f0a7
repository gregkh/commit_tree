RDMA/qib: Validate ->show()/store() callbacks before calling them

The permissions of the read-only or write-only sysfs files can be
changed (as root) and the user can then try to read a write-only file or
write to a read-only file which will lead to kernel crash here.

Protect against that by always validating the show/store callbacks.
