powerpc: Support CMDLINE_EXTEND

Bring powerpc in line with other architectures that support extending or
overriding the bootloader provided command line.

The current behaviour is most like CMDLINE_FROM_BOOTLOADER where the
bootloader command line is preferred but the kernel config can provide a
fallback so CMDLINE_FROM_BOOTLOADER is the default. CMDLINE_EXTEND can
be used to append the CMDLINE from the kernel config to the one provided
by the bootloader.
