y2038: vdso: powerpc: avoid timespec references

As a preparation to stop using 'struct timespec' in the kernel,
change the powerpc vdso implementation:

- split up the vdso data definition to have equivalent members
   for seconds and nanoseconds instead of an xtime structure

- use timespec64 as an intermediate for the xtime update

- change the asm-offsets definition to be based the appropriate
  fixed-length types

This is only a temporary fix for changing the types, in order
to actually support a 64-bit safe vdso32 version of clock_gettime(),
the entire powerpc vdso should be replaced with the generic
lib/vdso/ implementation. If that happens first, this patch
becomes obsolete.
