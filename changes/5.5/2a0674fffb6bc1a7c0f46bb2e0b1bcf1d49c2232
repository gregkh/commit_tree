net/smc: improve abnormal termination of link groups

If a link group and its connections must be terminated,
* wake up socket waiters
* do not enable buffer reuse

A linkgroup might be terminated while normal connection closing
is running. Avoid buffer reuse and its related LLC DELETE RKEY
call, if linkgroup termination has started. And use the earliest
indication of linkgroup termination possible, namely the removal
from the linkgroup list.
