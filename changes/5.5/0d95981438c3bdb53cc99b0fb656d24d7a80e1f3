x86: efi/random: Invoke EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL to seed the UEFI RNG table

Invoke the EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL protocol in the context of the x86 EFI stub,
same as is done on arm/arm64 since commit 568bc4e87033 ("efi/arm*/libstub:
Invoke EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL to seed the UEFI RNG table"). Within the stub,
a Linux-specific RNG seed UEFI config table will be seeded. The EFI routines
in the core kernel will pick that up later, yet still early during boot,
to seed the kernel entropy pool. If CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER, entropy
is credited for this seed.
