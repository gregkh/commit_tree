s390/unwind: stop gracefully at task pt_regs

Consider reaching task pt_regs graceful unwinder termination. Task
pt_regs itself never contains a valid state to which a task might return
within the kernel context (user task pt_regs is a special case). Since
we already avoid printing user task pt_regs and in most cases we don't
even bother filling task pt_regs psw and r15 with something reasonable
simply skip task pt_regs altogether. With this change unwind_error() now
accurately represent whether unwinder reached task pt_regs successfully
or failed along the way.
