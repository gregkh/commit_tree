lib: devres: prepare devm_ioremap_resource() for more variants

We want to add the write-combined variant of devm_ioremap_resource().
Let's first implement __devm_ioremap_resource() which takes
an additional argument type. The types are the same as for
__devm_ioremap(). The existing devm_ioremap_resource() now simply
calls __devm_ioremap_resource() with regular DEVM_IOREMAP type.
