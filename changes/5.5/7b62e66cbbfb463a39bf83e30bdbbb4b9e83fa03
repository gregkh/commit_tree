btrfs: punt all bios created in btrfs_submit_compressed_write()

Compressed writes happen in the background via kworkers. However, this
causes bios to be attributed to root bypassing any cgroup limits from
the actual writer. We tag the first bio with REQ_CGROUP_PUNT, which will
punt the bio to an appropriate cgroup specific workqueue and attribute
the IO properly. However, if btrfs_submit_compressed_write() creates a
new bio, we don't tag it the same way. Add the appropriate tagging for
subsequent bios.
