libbpf: Fix negative FD close() in xsk_setup_xdp_prog()

Fix issue reported by static analysis (Coverity). If bpf_prog_get_fd_by_id()
fails, xsk_lookup_bpf_maps() will fail as well and clean-up code will attempt
close() with fd=-1. Fix by checking bpf_prog_get_fd_by_id() return result and
exiting early.
