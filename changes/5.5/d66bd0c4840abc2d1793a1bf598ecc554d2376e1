iwlwifi: mvm: don't skip mgmt tid when flushing all tids

There are various of flows which require tids flushing
(disconnection, suspend, etc...).
Currently, when the driver instructs the FW to flush
he masks all the data tids(0-7).
However, the driver doesn't set the management tid (#15)
which cause the FW not to flush it.
When the FW tries to remove the mgmt queue he throws an assert
since it is not an empty queue.
instead of just set only the data tids set everything and let
the FW ignore the invalid tids.
