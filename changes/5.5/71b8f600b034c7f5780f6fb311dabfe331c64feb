gpio: Handle counting of Freescale chipselects

We have a special quirk to handle the Freescale
nonstandard SPI chipselect GPIOs in the gpiolib-of.c
file, but it currently only handles the case where
the GPIOs are actually requested (gpiod_*get()).

We also need to handle that the SPI core attempts
to count the GPIOs before use, and that needs a
similar quirk in the OF part of the library.
