block: fix get_max_segment_size() overflow on 32bit arch

Commit 429120f3df2d starts to take account of segment's start dma address
when computing max segment size, and data type of 'unsigned long'
is used to do that. However, the segment mask may be 0xffffffff, so
the figured out segment size may be overflowed in case of zero physical
address on 32bit arch.

Fix the issue by returning queue_max_segment_size() directly when that
happens.
