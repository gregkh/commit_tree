ASoC: rt5677: Enable jack detect while DSP is running

Before a hotword is detected, GPIO1 pin is configured as IRQ
output so that jack detect works. When a hotword is detected,
the DSP firmware configures the GPIO1 pin as GPIO1 and
drives a 1. rt5677_irq() is called after a rising edge on
the GPIO1 pin, due to either jack detect event or hotword
event, or both. All possible events are checked and handled
in rt5677_irq() where GPIO1 pin is configured back to IRQ
output if a hotword is detected.
