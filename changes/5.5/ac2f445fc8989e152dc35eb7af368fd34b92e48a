perf auxtrace: Add support for queuing AUX area samples

Add functions to queue AUX area samples in advance
(auxtrace_queue_data()) or individually (auxtrace_queues__add_sample())
or find out what queue a sample belongs on
(auxtrace_queues__sample_queue()).

auxtrace_queue_data() can also queue snapshot data which keeps snapshots
and samples ordered with respect to each other in case support for that
is desired.
