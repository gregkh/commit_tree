iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: fix ODR check in st_lsm6dsx_write_raw

Since st_lsm6dsx i2c master controller relies on accel device as trigger
and slave devices can run at different ODRs we must select an accel_odr >=
slave_odr. Report real accel ODR in st_lsm6dsx_check_odr() in order to
properly set sensor frequency in st_lsm6dsx_write_raw and avoid to
report unsupported frequency
