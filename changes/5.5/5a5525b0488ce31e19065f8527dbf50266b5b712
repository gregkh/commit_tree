s390/vdso: fix getcpu

getcpu reads the required values for cpu and node with two
instructions. This might lead to an inconsistent result if user space
gets preempted and migrated to a different CPU between the two
instructions.

Fix this by using just a single instruction to read both values at
once.

This is currently rather a theoretical bug, since there is no real
NUMA support available (except for NUMA emulation).
