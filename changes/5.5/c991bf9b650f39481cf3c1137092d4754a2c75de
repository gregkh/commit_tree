iio: dac: ad7303: replace mlock with own lock

This change replaces indio_dev's mlock with the driver's own lock. The lock
is mostly needed to protect state when changing the `dac_cache` info.
The lock has been extended to `ad7303_read_raw()`, to make sure that the
cache is updated if an SPI-write is already in progress.
