x86/ioperm: Add bitmap sequence number

Add a globally unique sequence number which is incremented when ioperm() is
changing the I/O bitmap of a task. Store the new sequence number in the
io_bitmap structure and compare it with the sequence number of the I/O
bitmap which was last loaded on a CPU. Only update the bitmap if the
sequence is different.

That should further reduce the overhead of I/O bitmap scheduling when there
are only a few I/O bitmap users on the system.

The 64bit sequence counter is sufficient. A wraparound of the sequence
counter assuming an ioperm() call every nanosecond would require about 584
years of uptime.
