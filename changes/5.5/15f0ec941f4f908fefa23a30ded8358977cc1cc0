mm/hugetlbfs: fix for_each_hstate() loop in init_hugetlbfs_fs()

LTP memfd_create04 started failing for some huge page sizes
after v5.4-10135-gc3bfc5dd73c6.

The problem is the check introduced to for_each_hstate() loop that
should skip default_hstate_idx.  Since it doesn't update 'i' counter,
all subsequent huge page sizes are skipped as well.
