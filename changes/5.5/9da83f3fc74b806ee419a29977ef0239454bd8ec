mm, memcg: clean up reclaim iter array

The mem_cgroup_reclaim_cookie is only used in memcg softlimit reclaim now,
and the priority of the reclaim is always 0.  We don't need to define the
iter in struct mem_cgroup_per_node as an array any more.  That could make
the code more clear and save some space.
