ACPI: NUMA: HMAT: Register HMAT at device_initcall level

In preparation for registering device-dax instances for accessing EFI
specific-purpose memory, arrange for the HMAT registration to occur
later in the init process. Critically HMAT initialization needs to occur
after e820__reserve_resources_late() which is the point at which the
iomem resource tree is populated with "Application Reserved"
(IORES_DESC_APPLICATION_RESERVED). e820__reserve_resources_late()
happens at subsys_initcall time.
