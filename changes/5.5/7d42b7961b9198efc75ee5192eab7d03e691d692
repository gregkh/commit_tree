staging/octeon: Mark Ethernet driver as BROKEN

The code doesn't compile due to incompatible pointer errors such as

drivers/staging/octeon/ethernet-tx.c:649:50: error:
	passing argument 1 of 'cvmx_wqe_get_grp' from incompatible pointer type

This is due to mixing, for example, cvmx_wqe_t with 'struct cvmx_wqe'.

Unfortunately, one can not just revert the primary offending commit, as doing so
results in secondary errors. This is made worse by the fact that the "removed"
typedefs still exist and are used widely outside the staging directory,
making the entire set of "remove typedef" changes pointless and wrong.

Reflect reality and mark the driver as BROKEN.

Fixes: 73aef0c9d2c6 ("staging: octeon: remove typedef declaration for cvmx_helper_link_info")
