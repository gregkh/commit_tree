selftests/bpf: Make CO-RE reloc test impartial to test_progs flavor

test_core_reloc_kernel test captures its own process name and validates
it as part of the test. Given extra "flavors" of test_progs, this break
for anything by default test_progs binary. Fix the test to cut out
flavor part of the process name.
