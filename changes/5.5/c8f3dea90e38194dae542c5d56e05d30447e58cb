mkcompile_h: use printf for LINUX_COMPILE_BY

Commit 858805b336be ("kbuild: add $(BASH) to run scripts with
bash-extension") shed light on portability issues. Here is another one.

Since commit f07726048d59 ("Fix handling of backlash character in
LINUX_COMPILE_BY name"), we must escape a backslash contained in
LINUX_COMPILE_BY. This is not working on such distros as Ubuntu.

As the POSIX spec [1] says, if any of the operands contain a backslash
( '\' ) character, the results are implementation-defined.

The actual shell of /bin/sh could be bash, dash, etc. depending on
distros, and the behavior of builtin echo command is different among
them.

The bash builtin echo, unless -e is given, copies the arguments to
stdout without expanding escape sequences (BSD-like behavior).

The dash builtin echo, in contrast, adopts System V behavior, which
does expand escape sequences without any option given.

Even non-builtin /bin/echo behaves differently depending on the system.
Due to these variations, echo is considered as a non-portable command.
Using printf is the common solution to avoid the portability issue.
