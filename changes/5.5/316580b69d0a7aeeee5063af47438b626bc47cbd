u64_stats: provide u64_stats_t type

On 64bit arches, struct u64_stats_sync is empty and provides
no help against load/store tearing.

Using READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() would be needed.

But the update side would be slightly more expensive.

local64_t was defined so that we could use regular adds
in a manner which is atomic wrt IRQs.

However the u64_stats infra means we do not have to use
local64_t on 32bit arches since the syncp provides the needed
protection.
