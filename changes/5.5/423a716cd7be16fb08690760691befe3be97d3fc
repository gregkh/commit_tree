btrfs: do not delete mismatched root refs

btrfs_del_root_ref() will simply WARN_ON() if the ref doesn't match in
any way, and then continue to delete the reference.  This shouldn't
happen, we have these values because there's more to the reference than
the original root and the sub root.  If any of these checks fail, return
-ENOENT.
