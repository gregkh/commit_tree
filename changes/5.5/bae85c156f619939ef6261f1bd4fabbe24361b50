block: Remove "dying" checks from sysfs callbacks

Block drivers must call del_gendisk() before blk_cleanup_queue().
del_gendisk() calls kobject_del() and kobject_del() waits until any
ongoing sysfs callback functions have finished. In other words, the
sysfs callback functions won't be called for a queue in the dying
state. Hence remove the "dying" checks from the sysfs callback
functions.
