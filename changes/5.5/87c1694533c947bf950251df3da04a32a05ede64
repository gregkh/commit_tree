drm/i915: save AUD_FREQ_CNTRL state at audio domain suspend

When audio power domain is suspended, the display driver must
save state of AUD_FREQ_CNTRL on Tiger Lake and Ice Lake
systems. The initial value of the register is set by BIOS and
is read by driver during the audio component init sequence.
