net: usb: lan78xx: limit size of local TSO packets

lan78xx_tx_bh() makes sure to not exceed MAX_SINGLE_PACKET_SIZE
bytes in the aggregated packets it builds, but does
nothing to prevent large GSO packets being submitted.

Pierre-Francois reported various hangs when/if TSO is enabled.

For localy generated packets, we can use netif_set_gso_max_size()
to limit the size of TSO packets.

Note that forwarded packets could still hit the issue,
so a complete fix might require implementing .ndo_features_check
for this driver, forcing a software segmentation if the size
of the TSO packet exceeds MAX_SINGLE_PACKET_SIZE.
