KVM: x86/vPMU: Rename pmu_ops callbacks from msr_idx to rdpmc_ecx

The leagcy pmu_ops->msr_idx_to_pmc is only called in kvm_pmu_rdpmc, so
this function actually receives the contents of ECX before RDPMC, and
translates it to a kvm_pmc. Let's clarify its semantic by renaming the
existing msr_idx_to_pmc to rdpmc_ecx_to_pmc, and is_valid_msr_idx to
is_valid_rdpmc_ecx; likewise for the wrapper kvm_pmu_is_valid_msr_idx.
