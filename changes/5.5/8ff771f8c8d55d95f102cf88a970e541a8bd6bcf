Revert "Input: synaptics-rmi4 - don't increment rmiaddr for SMBus transfers"

This reverts commit a284e11c371e446371675668d8c8120a27227339.

This causes problems (drifting cursor) with at least the F11 function that
reads more than 32 bytes.

The real issue is in the F54 driver, and so this should be fixed there, and
not in rmi_smbus.c.

So first revert this bad commit, then fix the real problem in F54 in another
patch.
