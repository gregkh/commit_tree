io-wq: remove worker->wait waitqueue

We only have one cases of using the waitqueue to wake the worker, the
rest are using wake_up_process(). Since we can save some cycles not
fiddling with the waitqueue io_wqe_worker(), switch the work activation
to task wakeup and get rid of the now unused wait_queue_head_t in
struct io_worker.
