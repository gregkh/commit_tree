s390/disassembler: don't hide instruction addresses

Due to kptr_restrict, JITted BPF code is now displayed like this:

000000000b6ed1b2: ebdff0800024  stmg    %r13,%r15,128(%r15)
000000004cde2ba0: 41d0f040      la      %r13,64(%r15)
00000000fbad41b0: a7fbffa0      aghi    %r15,-96

Leaking kernel addresses to dmesg is not a concern in this case, because
this happens only when JIT debugging is explicitly activated, which only
root can do.

Use %px in this particular instance, and also to print an instruction
address in show_code and PCREL (e.g. brasl) arguments in print_insn.
While at present functionally equivalent to %016lx, %px is recommended
by Documentation/core-api/printk-formats.rst for such cases.
