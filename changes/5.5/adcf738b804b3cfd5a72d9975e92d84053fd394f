net: hns3: cleanup some print format warning

Using '%d' for printing type unsigned int or '%u' for
type int would cause static tools to give false warnings,
so this patch cleanups this warning by using the suitable
format specifier of the type of variable.

BTW, modifies the type of some variables and macro to
synchronize with their usage.
