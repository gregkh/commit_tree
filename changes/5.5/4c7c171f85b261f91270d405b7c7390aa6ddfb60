iommu: Introduce cache_invalidate API

In any virtualization use case, when the first translation stage
is "owned" by the guest OS, the host IOMMU driver has no knowledge
of caching structure updates unless the guest invalidation activities
are trapped by the virtualizer and passed down to the host.

Since the invalidation data can be obtained from user space and will be
written into physical IOMMU, we must allow security check at various
layers. Therefore, generic invalidation data format are proposed here,
model specific IOMMU drivers need to convert them into their own format.
