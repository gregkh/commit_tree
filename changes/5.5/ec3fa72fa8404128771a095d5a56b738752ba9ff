spi: spidev: use new `word_delay` field for spi transfers

The `word_delay` field had it's type changed to `struct spi_delay`.
This allows users to specify nano-second or clock-cycle delays (if needed).

Converting to use `word_delay` is straightforward: it's just assigning the
value to `word_delay.value` and hard-coding the `word_delay.unit` to
`SPI_DELAY_UNIT_USECS`

This keeps the uapi for spidev un-changed. Changing it can be part of
another changeset and discussion.
