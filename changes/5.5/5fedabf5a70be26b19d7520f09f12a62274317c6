net/sonic: Clear interrupt flags immediately

The chip can change a packet's descriptor status flags at any time.
However, an active interrupt flag gets cleared rather late. This
allows a race condition that could theoretically lose an interrupt.
Fix this by clearing asserted interrupt flags immediately.
