fou: Fix IPv6 netlink policy

When submitting v2 of "fou: Support binding FoU socket" (1713cb37bf67),
I accidentally sent the wrong version of the patch and one fix was
missing. In the initial version of the patch, as well as the version 2
that I submitted, I incorrectly used ".type" for the two V6-attributes.
The correct is to use ".len".
