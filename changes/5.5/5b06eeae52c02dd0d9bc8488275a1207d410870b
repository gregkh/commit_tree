selftests: breakpoints: Fix a typo of function name

Since commit 5821ba969511 ("selftests: Add test plan API to kselftest.h
and adjust callers") accidentally introduced 'a' typo in the front of
run_test() function, breakpoint_test_arm64.c became not able to be
compiled.

Remove the 'a' from arun_test().
