nvme: Add hardware monitoring support

nvme devices report temperature information in the controller information
(for limits) and in the smart log. Currently, the only means to retrieve
this information is the nvme command line interface, which requires
super-user privileges.

At the same time, it would be desirable to be able to use NVMe temperature
information for thermal control.

This patch adds support to read NVMe temperatures from the kernel using the
hwmon API and adds temperature zones for NVMe drives. The thermal subsystem
can use this information to set thermal policies, and userspace can access
it using libsensors and/or the "sensors" command.

Example output from the "sensors" command:

nvme0-pci-0100
Adapter: PCI adapter
Composite:    +39.0°C  (high = +85.0°C, crit = +85.0°C)
Sensor 1:     +39.0°C
Sensor 2:     +41.0°C
