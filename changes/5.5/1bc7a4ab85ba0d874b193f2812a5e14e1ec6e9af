ice: Refactor removal of VLAN promiscuous rules

Currently ice_clear_vsi_promisc() detects if the VLAN ID sent is not 0
and sets the recipe_id to ICE_SW_LKUP_PROMISC_VLAN in that case and
ICE_SW_LKUP_PROMISC if the VLAN_ID is 0. However this doesn't allow VLAN
0 promiscuous rules to be removed, but they can be added. Fix this by
checking if the promisc_mask contains ICE_PROMISC_VLAN_RX or
ICE_PROMISC_VLAN_TX. This change was made to match what is being done
for ice_set_vsi_promisc().
