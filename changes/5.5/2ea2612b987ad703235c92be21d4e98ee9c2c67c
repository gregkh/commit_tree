selftests, bpf: Workaround an alu32 sub-register spilling issue

Currently, with latest llvm trunk, selftest test_progs failed obj
file test_seg6_loop.o with the following error in verifier:

  infinite loop detected at insn 76

The byte code sequence looks like below, and noted that alu32 has been
turned off by default for better generated codes in general:

      48:       w3 = 100
      49:       *(u32 *)(r10 - 68) = r3
      ...
  ;             if (tlv.type == SR6_TLV_PADDING) {
      76:       if w3 == 5 goto -18 <LBB0_19>
      ...
      85:       r1 = *(u32 *)(r10 - 68)
  ;     for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      86:       w1 += -1
      87:       if w1 == 0 goto +5 <LBB0_20>
      88:       *(u32 *)(r10 - 68) = r1

The main reason for verification failure is due to partial spills at
r10 - 68 for induction variable "i".

Current verifier only handles spills with 8-byte values. The above 4-byte
value spill to stack is treated to STACK_MISC and its content is not
saved. For the above example:

    w3 = 100
      R3_w=inv100 fp-64_w=inv1086626730498
    *(u32 *)(r10 - 68) = r3
      R3_w=inv100 fp-64_w=inv1086626730498
    ...
    r1 = *(u32 *)(r10 - 68)
      R1_w=inv(id=0,umax_value=4294967295,var_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff))
      fp-64=inv1086626730498

To resolve this issue, verifier needs to be extended to track sub-registers
in spilling, or llvm needs to enhanced to prevent sub-register spilling
in register allocation phase. The former will increase verifier complexity
and the latter will need some llvm "hacking".

Let us workaround this issue by declaring the induction variable as "long"
type so spilling will happen at non sub-register level. We can revisit this
later if sub-register spilling causes similar or other verification issues.
