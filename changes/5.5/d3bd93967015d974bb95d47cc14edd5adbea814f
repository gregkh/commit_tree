IB/cma: Honor traffic class from lower netdevice for RoCE

When a macvlan netdevice is used for RoCE, consider the tos->prio->tc
mapping as SL using its lower netdevice.

1. If the lower netdevice is a VLAN netdevice, consider the VLAN netdevice
   and it's parent netdevice for mapping
2. If the lower netdevice is not a VLAN netdevice, consider tc mapping
   directly from the lower netdevice
