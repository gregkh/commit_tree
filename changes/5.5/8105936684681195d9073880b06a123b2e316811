spi: tegra114: change format for `spi_set_cs_timing()` function

The initial version of `spi_set_cs_timing()` was implemented with
consideration only for clock-cycles as delay.

For cases like `CS setup` time, it's sometimes needed that micro-seconds
(or nano-seconds) are required, or sometimes even longer delays, for cases
where the device needs a little longer to start transferring that after CS
is asserted.
