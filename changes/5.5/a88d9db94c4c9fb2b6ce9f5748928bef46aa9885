scsi: pm80xx: Fix dereferencing dangling pointer

sas_task structure should not be used after task_done is called.  If the
device is gone or not attached, we call task_done on t and continue to use
in the sas_task in rest of the function. task_done is pointing to
sas_ata_task_done, may free the memory associated with the task before
returning.
