ipv4: Detect rollover in specific fib table dump

Sven-Haegar reported looping on fib dumps when 255.255.255.255 route has
been added to a table. The looping is caused by the key rolling over from
FFFFFFFF to 0. When dumping a specific table only, we need a means to detect
when the table dump is done. The key and count saved to cb args are both 0
only at the start of the table dump. If key is 0 and count > 0, then we are
in the rollover case. Detect and return to avoid looping.

This only affects dumps of a specific table; for dumps of all tables
(the case prior to the change in the Fixes tag) inet_dump_fib moved
the entry counter to the next table and reset the cb args used by
fib_table_dump and fn_trie_dump_leaf, so the rollover ffffffff back
to 0 did not cause looping with the dumps.

Fixes: effe67926624 ("net: Enable kernel side filtering of route dumps")
