PM / devfreq: tegra30: Tune up MCCPU boost-down coefficient

MCCPU boosts up very aggressively by 800% and boosts down very mildly by
10%. This doesn't work well when system is idling because the very slow
de-boosting results in lots of consecutive-down interrupts, in result
memory stays clocked high and CPU doesn't enter deepest idling state
instead of keeping memory at lowest freq and having CPU cluster turned
off. A more faster de-boosting fixes the case of idling system and doesn't
affect the case of an active system.
