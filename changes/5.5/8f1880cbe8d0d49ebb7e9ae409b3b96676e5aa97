net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Configure IMP port for 2Gb/sec

With the implementation of the system reset controller we lost a setting
that is currently applied by the bootloader and which configures the IMP
port for 2Gb/sec, the default is 1Gb/sec. This is needed given the
number of ports and applications we expect to run so bring back that
setting.
