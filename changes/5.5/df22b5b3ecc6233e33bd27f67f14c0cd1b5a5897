ubifs: Fixed missed le64_to_cpu() in journal

In the ubifs_jnl_write_inode() functon, it calls ubifs_iget()
with xent->inum. The xent->inum is __le64, but the ubifs_iget()
takes native cpu endian.

I think that this should be changed to passing le64_to_cpu(xent->inum)
to fix the following sparse warning:

fs/ubifs/journal.c:902:58: warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different base types)
fs/ubifs/journal.c:902:58:    expected unsigned long inum
fs/ubifs/journal.c:902:58:    got restricted __le64 [usertype] inum
