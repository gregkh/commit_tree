ext4: move inode extension/truncate code out from ->iomap_end() callback

In preparation for implementing the iomap direct I/O modifications,
the inode extension/truncate code needs to be moved out from the
ext4_iomap_end() callback. For direct I/O, if the current code
remained, it would behave incorrrectly. Updating the inode size prior
to converting unwritten extents would potentially allow a racing
direct I/O read to find unwritten extents before being converted
correctly.

The inode extension/truncate code now resides within a new helper
ext4_handle_inode_extension(). This function has been designed so that
it can accommodate for both DAX and direct I/O extension/truncate
operations.
