arm64: dts: rockchip: Add Beelink A1

Beelink A1 is a TV box implementing the higher-end options of the
RK3328 reference design - the DTB from the stock Android firmware is
clearly the "rk3328-box-plus" variant from the Rockchip 3.10 BSP with
minor modifications to accommodate the USB WiFi module and additional
VFD-style LED driver. It features:

- 4GB of 32-bit LPDDR3
- 16GB of HS200 eMMC (newer models with 32GB also exist)
- Realtek RTL8211F phy for gigabit ethernet
- Fn-Link 6221E-UUC module (RealTek RTL8821CU) for 11ac WiFi
  and Bluetooth 4.2
- HDMI and analog A/V
- 1x USB 3.0 type A host, 1x USB 2.0 type A OTG, 1x micro SD
- IR receiver and a neat little LED clock display.
