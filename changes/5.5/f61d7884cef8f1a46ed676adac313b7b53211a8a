mac80211: don't re-parse elems in ieee80211_assoc_success()

We've already parsed the same data in the caller, so we can
pass it. The only thing is that we might fill in more details
in ieee80211_assoc_success(), but that doesn't bother the
caller, so it's fine to do even when we share the parsed data.

This reduces the stack space usage of the call stack here,
Arnd reported it had grown above the 1024 byte warning limit.
