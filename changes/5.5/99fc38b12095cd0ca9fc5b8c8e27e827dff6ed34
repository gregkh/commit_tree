drm/i915: Add transcoder restriction to PSR2

According to PSR2_CTL definition in BSpec there is only one instance
of PSR2_CTL. Platforms gen < 12 with EDP transcoder only support PSR2
on TRANSCODER_EDP while on TGL PSR2 is only supported by
TRANSCODER_A.

Since BDW PSR is allowed on any port, but we need to restrict by
transcoder.

v8: Renamed _psr2_supported_in_trans() to psr2_supported() (Lucas)

v9: Renamed psr2_supported() to transcoder_has_psr2() (Ville)
