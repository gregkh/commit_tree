perf block: Cleanup and refactor block info functions

We have already implemented some block-info related functions.
Now it's time to do some cleanup, refactoring and move the
functions and structures to new block-info.h/block-info.c.

 v4:
 ---
 Move code for skipping column length calculation to patch:
 'perf diff: Don't use hack to skip column length calculation'

 v3:
 ---
 1. Rename the patch title
 2. Rename from block.h/block.c to block-info.h/block-info.c
 3. Move more common part to block-info, such as
    block_info__process_sym.
 4. Remove the nasty hack for skipping calculation of column
    length
