ALSA: hda: Modify stream stripe mask only when needed

The recent commit in HD-audio stream management for changing the
stripe control seems causing a regression on some platforms.  The
stripe control is currently used only by HDMI codec, and applying the
stripe mask unconditionally may lead to scratchy and static noises as
seen on some MacBooks.

For addressing the regression, this patch changes the stream
management code to apply the stripe mask conditionally only when the
codec driver requested.
