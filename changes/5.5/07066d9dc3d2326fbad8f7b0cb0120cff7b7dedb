ixgbe: protect TX timestamping from API misuse

HW timestamping can only be requested for a packet if the NIC is first
setup via ioctl(SIOCSHWTSTAMP). If this step was skipped, then the ixgbe
driver still allowed TX packets to request HW timestamping. In this
situation, we see 'clearing Tx Timestamp hang' noise in the log.

Fix this by checking that the NIC is configured for HW TX timestamping
before accepting a HW TX timestamping request.
