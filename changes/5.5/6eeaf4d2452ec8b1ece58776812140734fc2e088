arm64: dts: meson: Add capacity-dmips-mhz attributes to G12B

Meson G12B SoCs (S922X and A311D) are a big-little design where not all CPUs
are equal; the A53s cores are weaker than the A72s.

Include capacity-dmips-mhz properties to tell the OS there is a difference
in processing capacity. The dmips values are based on similar submissions for
other A53/A72 SoCs: HiSilicon 3660 [1] and Rockchip RK3399 [2].

This change is particularly beneficial for use-cases like retro gaming where
emulators often run on a single core. The OS now chooses an A72 core instead
of an A53 core.
