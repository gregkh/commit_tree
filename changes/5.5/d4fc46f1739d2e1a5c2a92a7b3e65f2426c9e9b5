gpiolib: acpi: Make acpi_gpiochip_alloc_event always return AE_OK

acpi_gpiochip_alloc_event is used to loop over all _AEI resources, if
we fail to bind an event handler to one of them, that is not a reason to
not try the other resources.

This commit modifies acpi_gpiochip_alloc_event to always return AE_OK,
so that we will always try to add an event handler for all _AEI resources.
