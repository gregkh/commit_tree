mips: Fix gettimeofday() in the vdso library

The libc provides a discovery mechanism for vDSO library and its
symbols. When a symbol is not exposed by the vDSOs the libc falls back
on the system calls.

With the introduction of the unified vDSO library on mips this behavior
is not honored anymore by the kernel in the case of gettimeofday().

The issue has been noticed and reported due to a dhclient failure on the
CI20 board:

root@letux:~# dhclient
../../../../lib/isc/unix/time.c:200: Operation not permitted
root@letux:~#

Restore the original behavior fixing gettimeofday() in the vDSO library.
