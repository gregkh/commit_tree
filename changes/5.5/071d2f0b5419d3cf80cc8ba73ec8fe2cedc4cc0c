MIPS: r4k-bugs64: Limit R4k bug checks to affected systems

Only build the checks for R4k errata workarounds if we expect that the
kernel might actually run on a system with an R4k CPU - ie.
CONFIG_SYS_HAS_CPU_R4X00=y & we're targeting a pre-MIPSr1 ISA revision.

Rename cpu-bugs64.c to r4k-bugs64.c to indicate the fact that the code
is specific to R4k CPUs.
