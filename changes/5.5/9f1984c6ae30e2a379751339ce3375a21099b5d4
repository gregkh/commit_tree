ARM: 8929/1: use APSR_nzcv instead of r15 as mrc operand

LLVM's integrated assembler does not accept r15 as mrc operand.
  arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S:1267:16: error: operand must be a register in range [r0, r14] or apsr_nzcv
  1: mrc p15, 0, r15, c7, c14, 3 @ test,clean,invalidate D cache
                 ^

Use APSR_nzcv instead of r15. The GNU assembler supports this
syntax since binutils 2.21 [0].
