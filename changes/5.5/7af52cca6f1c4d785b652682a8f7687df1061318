vfio-ccw: Refactor how the traces are built

Commit 3cd90214b70f ("vfio: ccw: add tracepoints for interesting error
paths") added a quick trace point to determine where a channel program
failed while being processed.  It's a great addition, but adding more
traces to vfio-ccw is more cumbersome than it needs to be.

Let's refactor how this is done, so that additional traces are easier
to add and can exist outside of the FSM if we ever desire.
