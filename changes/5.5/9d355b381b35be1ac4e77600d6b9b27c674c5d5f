perf map_groups: Pass the object to map_groups__find_ams()

We were just passing a map to look for and reuse its map->groups member,
but the idea is that this is going away, as a map can be in multiple
rb_trees when being reused via a map_node, so do as all the other
map_groups methods and pass as its first arg the object being operated
on.
