staging: rtl8723bs: Remove phy_Config*With*ParaFile() calls

The rtl8723bs driver tries to load various parameters from disk,
circumventing the standard firmware loader mechanism and using DIY
code for this.

No devices which run the mainline kernel ship with these files and even
if these files were present then they still would not be loaded without
additional module parameters. To be precise the following 3 conditions
must all 3 be true for on disk parameters to be used:

1) The rtw_load_phy_file modparam must contain the mask for the type, this
   defaults to(LOAD_BB_PG_PARA_FILE | LOAD_RF_TXPWR_LMT_PARA_FILE) so with
   the default settings this condition is only true for:
   phy_ConfigBBWithPgParaFile()
   PHY_ConfigRFWithPowerLimitTableParaFile(); and
2) rtw_phy_file_path modparam must be set to say "/lib/firmware/"; and
3) Store a /lib/firmware/rtl8723b/XXX file in the expected format.

In practice all 3 being true never happens, so the
phy_Config*With*ParaFile() calls are nops, remove them.

The actual code implementing them will be removed in a separate patch.

Note the ODM_ConfigRFWithHeaderFile() and ODM_ConfigBBWithHeaderFile()
functions always return HAL_STATUS_SUCCESS, this patch makes use of this
to simplify the new code without the phy_Config*With*ParaFile() calls.
