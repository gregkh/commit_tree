drm/i915/selftests: Exercise potential false lite-restore

If execlists's lite-restore is based on the common GEM context tag
rather than the per-intel_context LRCA, then a context switch between
two intel_contexts on the same engine derived from the same GEM context
will perform a lite-restore instead of a full context switch. We can
exploit this by poisoning the ringbuffer of the first context and trying
to trick a simple RING_TAIL update (i.e. lite-restore)

v2: Also check what happens if preempt ce[0] with ce[1] (both instances
on the same engine from the same parent context) [Tvrtko]
