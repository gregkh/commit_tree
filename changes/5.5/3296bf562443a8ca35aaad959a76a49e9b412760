btrfs: transaction: Cleanup unused TRANS_STATE_BLOCKED

The state was introduced in commit 4a9d8bdee368 ("Btrfs: make the state
of the transaction more readable"), then in commit 302167c50b32
("btrfs: don't end the transaction for delayed refs in throttle") the
state is completely removed.

So we can just clean up the state since it's only compared but never
set.
