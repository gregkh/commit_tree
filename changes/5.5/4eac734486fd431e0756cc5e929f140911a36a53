kselftest: Support old perl versions

On an old perl such as v5.10.1, `kselftest/prefix.pl` gives below error
message:

    Can't locate object method "autoflush" via package "IO::Handle" at kselftest/prefix.pl line 10.

This commit fixes the error by explicitly specifying the use of the
`IO::Handle` package.
