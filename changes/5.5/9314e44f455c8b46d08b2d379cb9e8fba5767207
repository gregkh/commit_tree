ALSA: aloop: Avoid unexpected timer event callback tasklets

loopback_snd_timer_close_cable() function waits until all
scheduled tasklets are completed, but the timer is closed after that
and can generate more event callbacks, scheduling new tasklets,
that will not be synchronized with cable closing.
Move tasklet_kill() call to be executed after snd_timer_close()
call to avoid such case.
