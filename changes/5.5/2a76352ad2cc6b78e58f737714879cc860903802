ARM: vexpress: Set-up shared OPP table instead of individual for each CPU

Currently we add individual copy of same OPP table for each CPU within
the cluster. This is redundant and doesn't reflect the reality.

We can't use core cpumask to set policy->cpus in ve_spc_cpufreq_init()
anymore as it gets called via cpuhp_cpufreq_online()->cpufreq_online()
->cpufreq_driver->init() and the cpumask gets updated upon CPU hotplug
operations. It also may cause issues when the vexpress_spc_cpufreq
driver is built as a module.

Since ve_spc_clk_init is built-in device initcall, we should be able to
use the same topology_core_cpumask to set the opp sharing cpumask via
dev_pm_opp_set_sharing_cpus and use the same later in the driver via
dev_pm_opp_get_sharing_cpus.
