ALSA: hda: add Intel DSP configuration / probe code

For distributions, we need one place where we can decide
which driver will be activated for the auto-configation of the
Intel's HDA hardware with DSP. Actually, we cover three drivers:

* Legacy HDA
* Intel SST
* Intel Sound Open Firmware (SOF)

All those drivers registers similar PCI IDs, so the first
driver probed from the PCI stack can win. But... it is not
guaranteed that the correct driver wins.

This commit changes Intel's NHLT ACPI module to a common
DSP probe module for the Intel's hardware. All above sound
drivers calls this code. The user can force another behaviour
using the module parameter 'dsp_driver' located in
the 'snd-intel-dspcfg' module.

This change allows to add specific dmi checks for the specific
systems. The examples are taken from the pull request:
