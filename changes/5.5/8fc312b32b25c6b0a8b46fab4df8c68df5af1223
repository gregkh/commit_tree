mm/hugetlbfs: fix error handling when setting up mounts

It is assumed that the hugetlbfs_vfsmount[] array will contain either a
valid vfsmount pointer or NULL for each hstate after initialization.
Changes made while converting to use fs_context broke this assumption.

While fixing the hugetlbfs_vfsmount issue, it was discovered that
init_hugetlbfs_fs never did correctly clean up when encountering a vfs
mount error.

It was found during code inspection.  A small memory allocation failure
would be the most likely cause of taking a error path with the bug.
This is unlikely to happen as this is early init code.
