block: Remove REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET plugging

REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET operations cannot be merged as these bios and requests
do not have a size and are never sequential due to the zone start sector
position required for their execution. As a result, there is no point in
using a plug around blkdev_reset_zones() bio issuing loop. This patch
removes this unnecessary plugging.
