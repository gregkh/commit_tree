drm/amdgpu: avoid upload corrupted ta ucode to psp

xgmi, ras, hdcp and dtm ta are actually separated ucode and
need to handled case by case to upload to psp.

We support the case that ta binary have one or multiple of
them built-in. As a result, the driver should check each ta
binariy's availablity before decide to upload them to psp.

In the terminate (unload) case, the driver will check the
context readiness before perform unload activity. It's fine
to keep it as is.
