perf evlist: Introduce append_tp_filter() method

Will be used by 'perf trace' to support 'perf trace --filter', we need
to append to any pre-existing filter.

When parse_filter() gets invoked to process --filter, it'll set the
filter to that specified on the command line, later on, when we filter
out 'perf trace' own pid to avoid an event feedback loop, we need to
preserve the command line filter put in place by parse_filter().
