mvpp2: prefetch frame header

When receiving traffic, eth_type_trans() is high up on the perf top list,
because it's the first function which access the packet data.

Move the DMA unmap a bit higher, and put a prefetch just after it, so we
have more time to load the data into the cache.

The packet rate increase is about 14% with a tc drop test: 1620 => 1853 kpps
