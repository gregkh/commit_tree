ice: Use ice_ena_vsi and ice_dis_vsi in DCB configuration flow

DCB configuration flow needs to disable and enable only the PF (main)
VSI, so use ice_ena_vsi and ice_dis_vsi. To avoid the use of ifdef to
control the staticness of these functions, move them to ice_lib.c.

Also replace the allocate and copy of old_cfg to kmemdup() in
ice_pf_dcb_cfg().
