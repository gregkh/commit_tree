nvme/pci Limit write queue sizes to possible cpus

The driver can never use more queues of any type than the number of
possible CPUs, so a higher value causes the driver to allocate more
memory for IO queues than it could ever use. Limit the parameter at
module load time to the number of possible cpus.
