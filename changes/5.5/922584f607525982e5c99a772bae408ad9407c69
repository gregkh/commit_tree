octeontx2-af: Update NPC KPU packet parsing profile

Updated NPC KPU packet parsing profile with support for following

- Fragmentation support for IPv4 IPv6 outer header
- NIX instruction header support
- QinQ with TPID of 0x8100 as non inner most vlan tag, as legacy
  network equipments still generate QinQ packets with this configuration.
- To better support RSS for tunnelled packets, udp based tunnel
  protocols such as vxlan, vxlan-gpe, geneve and gtpu are now
  captured into a separate layer E. Consequently, the inner
  packet headers are pushed one layer down to LF, LG, and LH
  accordingly.
- Support for rfc7510 mpls in udp. Up to 4 MPLS labels can be parsed
  and captured in one layer LE.
- Parser support for DSA, extended DSA and eDSA tags right after
  ethernet header by Marvell SOHO and Falcon switches. For extended
  DSA and eDSA tags, a special PKIND of 62 is used, as these tags don't
  contain a tpid field.
- Higig2 protocol header parsing support, added a NPC_LT_LA_HIGIG2_ETHER
  for a combined header of HIGIG2 and Ethernet.  Add a
  NPC_LT_LA_IH_NIX_HIGIG2_ETHER for a combined header of nix_ih,
  HIGIG2 and Ethernet on egress side. Also added 2 upper flags in LA to
  indicate the presence of nix_ih and HIGIG2.

Other changes include
- IPv4.TTL==0 IPv6.HLIM==0 check
- Per RFC 1858, mark fragment offset == 1 as error
- TCP invalid flags check
- Separate error codes for outer and inner IPv4 checksum errors.
- Fix a parser error when KPU parses incoming IPSec ESP and AH packets
- NPC vtag capture/strip hardware expect tag pointer to point to
  tpid/ethertype instead of tci. So move lb_ptr to point to tpid/ethertype.
- Fix npc parser error when parsing udp packets that don't have any payload.
- For a single MCAM entry to match on packets with one or stacked vlan tags
  combine NPC_LT_LB_STAG and NPC_LT_LB_QINQ to NPC_LT_LB_STAG_QINQ.
- NVGRE to have a separate ltype LD_NVGRE instead of combined with LD_GRE.
- Reserve top LD/LTYPEs to support custom KPU profile fields.
