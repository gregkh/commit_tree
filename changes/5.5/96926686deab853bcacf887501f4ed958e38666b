rcu: Make CPU-hotplug removal operations enable tick

CPU-hotplug removal operations run the multi_cpu_stop() function, which
relies on the scheduler to gain control from whatever is running on the
various online CPUs, including any nohz_full CPUs running long loops in
kernel-mode code.  Lack of the scheduler-clock interrupt on such CPUs
can delay multi_cpu_stop() for several minutes and can also result in
RCU CPU stall warnings.  This commit therefore causes CPU-hotplug removal
operations to enable the scheduler-clock interrupt on all online CPUs.
