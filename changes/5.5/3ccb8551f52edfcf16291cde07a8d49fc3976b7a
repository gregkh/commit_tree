soundwire: cadence_master: make clock stop exit configurable on init

The use of clock stop is not a requirement, the IP can e.g. be
completely power gated and not detect any wakes while in s2idle/deep
sleep.

For now clock-stop is not supported anyways so the control parameter
is always false. This will be revisited when we add clock stop.
