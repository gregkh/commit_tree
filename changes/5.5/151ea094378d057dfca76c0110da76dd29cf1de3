r8152: Add identifier names for function pointers

Checkpatch throws warnings for function pointer declarations which lack
identifier names.

An example of such a warning is:

WARNING: function definition argument 'struct r8152 *' should
also have an identifier name
739: FILE: drivers/net/usb/r8152.c:739:
+               void (*init)(struct r8152 *);

So, fix those warnings by adding the identifier names.

While we are at it, also fix a character limit violation which was
causing another checkpatch warning.
