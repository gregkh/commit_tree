drm/i915/execlists: Prevent merging requests with conflicting flags

We set out-of-bound parameters inside the i915_requests.flags field,
such as disabling preemption or marking the end-of-context. We should
not coalesce consecutive requests if they have differing instructions
as we only inspect the last active request in a context. Thus if we
allow a later request to be merged into the same execution context, it
will mask any of the earlier flags.
