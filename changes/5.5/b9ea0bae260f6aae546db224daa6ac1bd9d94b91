ACPI: PM: Avoid attaching ACPI PM domain to certain devices

Certain ACPI-enumerated devices represented as platform devices in
Linux, like fans, require special low-level power management handling
implemented by their drivers that is not in agreement with the ACPI
PM domain behavior.  That leads to problems with managing ACPI fans
during system-wide suspend and resume.

For this reason, make acpi_dev_pm_attach() skip the affected devices
by adding a list of device IDs to avoid to it and putting the IDs of
the affected devices into that list.
