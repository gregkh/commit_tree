net: mvneta: fix build skb for bm capable devices

Fix build_skb for bm capable devices when they fall-back using swbm path
(e.g. when bm properties are configured in device tree but
CONFIG_MVNETA_BM_ENABLE is not set). In this case rx_offset_correction is
overwritten so we need to use it building skb instead of
MVNETA_SKB_HEADROOM directly

Fixes: 8dc9a0888f4c ("net: mvneta: rely on build_skb in mvneta_rx_swbm poll routine")
Fixes: 0db51da7a8e9 ("net: mvneta: add basic XDP support")
