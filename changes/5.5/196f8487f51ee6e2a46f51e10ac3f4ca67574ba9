libbpf: Move directory creation into _pin() functions

The existing pin_*() functions all try to create the parent directory
before pinning. Move this check into the per-object _pin() functions
instead. This ensures consistent behaviour when auto-pinning is
added (which doesn't go through the top-level pin_maps() function), at the
cost of a few more calls to mkdir().
