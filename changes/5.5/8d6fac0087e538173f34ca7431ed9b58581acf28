btrfs: add support for 4-copy replication (raid1c4)

Add new block group profile to store 4 copies in a simliar way that
current RAID1 does.  The profile attributes and constraints are defined
in the raid table and used by the same code that already handles the 2-
and 3-copy RAID1.

The minimum number of devices is 4, the maximum number of devices/chunks
that can be lost/damaged is 3. There is no comparable traditional RAID
level, the profile is added for future needs to accompany triple-parity
and beyond.
