net/mlx5e: Verify that rule has at least one fwd/drop action

Currently, mlx5 tc layer doesn't verify that rule has at least one forward
or drop action which leads to following firmware syndrome when user tries
to offload such action:

[ 1824.860501] mlx5_core 0000:81:00.0: mlx5_cmd_check:753:(pid 29458): SET_FLOW_TABLE_ENTRY(0x936) op_mod(0x0) failed, status bad parameter(0x3), syndrome (0x144b7a)

Add check at the end of parse_tc_fdb_actions() that verifies that resulting
attribute has action fwd or drop flag set.
