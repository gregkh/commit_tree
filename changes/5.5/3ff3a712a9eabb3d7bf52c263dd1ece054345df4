media: ti-vpe: vpe: don't rely on colorspace member for conversion

Up to now VPE was relying on the colorspace value of struct v4l2_format
as an indication to perform color space conversion from YUV to RGB or
not.

Instead we should used the source/destination fourcc codes as a more
reliable indication to perform color space conversion or not.

To do so, we rework the csc module to use "struct v4l2_format *" as
parameters, and reorganize the coefficients tables in a more logical
way.
