dt-bindings: Clean-up regulator '-supply' schemas

Regulator '*-supply' properties are always a single phandle, so
'maxItems: 1' or a $ref is not necessary. All that's needed is either
'true' or an optional 'description'. Following this clean-up, the
meta-schema will enforce this pattern.

There's one case in tree with 'innolux,n156bge-l21' having 2 phandles.
This appears to be a mistake or abuse of simple-panel as it's 2 different
voltage rails connected to 'power-supply'.
