scsi: zfcp: diagnostics buffer caching and use for exchange port data

The FCP channel exposes two central interfaces to receive information about
the local FCP-Adapter/-Port: Exchange Port and Exchange Config Data. Using
these commands can negatively impact the adapter if we allow them to be
sent at a very high rate.

The later parts of this patchset will introduce new user-interfaces to
receive more diagnostics from the adapter. To prevent any negative impact
from using those, this patch adds a simple caching-mechanism that will
prevent a malicious/faulty userspace-application from generating an
abnormal high amount of Exchange Port/Config Data traffic.

Relevant diagnostic data that is received via Exchange Config/Port Data is
cached in buffers associated with the corresponding adapter-struct.  Each
buffer is associated with a timestamp that signals how old the data is,
and, added via a following patch in this series, lets userspace-interfaces
determine when the data is too old and needs to be updated.

Buffer-updates are made during the normal response path of the
corresponding command. With this patch only the output of the Exchange Port
Data command is captured.
