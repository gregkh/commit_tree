arm64: dts: allwinner: orange-pi-3: Enable USB 3.0 host support

Enable Allwinner's USB 3.0 phy and the host controller. Orange Pi 3
board has GL3510 USB 3.0 4-port hub connected to the SoC's USB 3.0
port. All four ports are exposed via USB3-A connectors. VBUS is
always on, since it's powered directly from DCIN (VCC-5V) and
not switchable.
