drm/amd/display: check phy dpalt lane count config

[Why]
Type-c PHY config is not align with dpcd lane count.
When those values didn't match, it cause driver do
link training with 4 lane but phy only can output 2 lane.
The link trainig always fail.

[How]
1. Modify get_max_link_cap function. According DPALT_DP4
to update max lane count.
2. Add dp_mst_verify_link_cap to handle MST case because
we didn't call dp_mst_verify_link_cap for MST case.
