arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: olinuxino: Fix SDIO supply regulator

A64-OLinuXino uses DCDC1 (VCC-IO) for MMC1 supply. In commit 916b68cfe4b5
("arm64: dts: a64-olinuxino: Enable RTL8723BS WiFi") ALDO2 is set, which is
VCC-PL. Since DCDC1 is always present, the boards are working without a
problem.

This patch sets the correct regulator.
