bpf: Make use of probe_user_write in probe write helper

Convert the bpf_probe_write_user() helper to probe_user_write() such that
writes are not attempted under KERNEL_DS anymore which is buggy as kernel
and user space pointers can have overlapping addresses. Also, given we have
the access_ok() check inside probe_user_write(), the helper doesn't need
to do it twice.
