ftrace: Return ENOTSUPP when DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_DIRECT_CALLS is not configured

When CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_DIRECT_CALLS is not set it's best to
have the stub functions return ENOTSUPP instead of ENODEV,
otherwise ENODEV is a valid error when ip is incorrect which is
indistinguishable from ftrace not compiled in.
