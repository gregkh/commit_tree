drm/i915: unify icp, tgp and mcc irq handling

The differences are only on the pins, trigger and long_detect function.
The MCC handling is already partially merged, so merge TGP as well.
Remove the pins argument from icp_irq_handler() so we have all the
differences between the 3 set in a common if ladder.
