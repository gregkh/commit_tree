staging: rtl8192e: fix potential use after free

The variable skb is released via kfree_skb() when the return value of
_rtl92e_tx is not zero. However, after that, skb is accessed again to
read its length, which may result in a use after free bug. This patch
fixes the bug by moving the release operation to where skb is never
used later.
