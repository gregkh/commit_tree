powerpc/eeh: differentiate duplicate detection message

Currently when an EEH error is detected, the system log receives the
same (or almost the same) message twice:

  EEH: PHB#0 failure detected, location: N/A
  EEH: PHB#0 failure detected, location: N/A
or
  EEH: eeh_dev_check_failure: Frozen PHB#0-PE#0 detected
  EEH: Frozen PHB#0-PE#0 detected

This looks like a bug, but in fact the messages are from different
functions and mean slightly different things.  So keep both but change
one of the messages slightly, so that it's clear they are different:

  EEH: PHB#0 failure detected, location: N/A
  EEH: Recovering PHB#0, location: N/A
or
  EEH: eeh_dev_check_failure: Frozen PHB#0-PE#0 detected
  EEH: Recovering PHB#0-PE#0
