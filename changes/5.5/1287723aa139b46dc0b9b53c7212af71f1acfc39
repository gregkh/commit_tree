r8169: add support for RTL8117

Add support for chip version RTL8117. Settings have been copied from
Realtek's r8168 driver, there however chip ID 54a belongs to a chip
version called RTL8168FP. It was confirmed that RTL8117 works with
Realtek's driver, so both chip versions seem to be the same or at
least compatible.
