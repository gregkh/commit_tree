spi: dw: Add compatible string for Renesas RZ/N1 SPI Controller

The Renesas RZ/N1 SPI Controller is based on the Synopsys DW SSI, but has
additional registers for software CS control and DMA. This patch does not
address the changes required for DMA support, it simply adds the compatible
string. The CS registers are not needed as Linux can use gpios for the CS
signals.
