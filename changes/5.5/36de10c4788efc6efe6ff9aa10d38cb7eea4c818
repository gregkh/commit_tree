xtensa: fix TLB sanity checker

Virtual and translated addresses retrieved by the xtensa TLB sanity
checker must be consistent, i.e. correspond to the same state of the
checked TLB entry. KASAN shadow memory is mapped dynamically using
auto-refill TLB entries and thus may change TLB state between the
virtual and translated address retrieval, resulting in false TLB
insanity report.
Move read_xtlb_translation close to read_xtlb_virtual to make sure that
read values are consistent.
