KVM: arm64: Provide VCPU attributes for stolen time

Allow user space to inform the KVM host where in the physical memory
map the paravirtualized time structures should be located.

User space can set an attribute on the VCPU providing the IPA base
address of the stolen time structure for that VCPU. This must be
repeated for every VCPU in the VM.

The address is given in terms of the physical address visible to
the guest and must be 64 byte aligned. The guest will discover the
address via a hypercall.
