iio: adc: intel_mrfld_adc: Allocating too much data in probe()

This probe function is passing the wrong size to devm_iio_device_alloc().
It is supposed to be the size of the private data.  Fortunately,
sizeof(*indio_dev) is larger than sizeof(struct mrfld_adc) so it doesn't
cause a runtime problem.
