ath10k: restore QCA9880-AR1A (v1) detection

This patch restores the old behavior that read
the chip_id on the QCA988x before resetting the
chip. This needs to be done in this order since
the unsupported QCA988x AR1A chips fall off the
bus when resetted. Otherwise the next MMIO Op
after the reset causes a BUS ERROR and panic.
