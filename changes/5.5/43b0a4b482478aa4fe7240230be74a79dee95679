arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-cheza: delete zap-shader

This is unused on cheza.  Delete the node to get ride of the reserved-
memory section, and to avoid the driver from attempting to load a zap
shader that doesn't exist every time it powers up the GPU.

This also avoids a massive amount of dmesg spam about missing zap fw:
  msm ae00000.mdss: [drm:adreno_request_fw] *ERROR* failed to load
qcom/a630_zap.mdt: -2
  adreno 5000000.gpu: [drm:adreno_zap_shader_load] *ERROR* Unable to
load a630_zap.mdt
