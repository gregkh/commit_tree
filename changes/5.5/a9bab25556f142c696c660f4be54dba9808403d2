usb: usb251xb: simplify reset helper

Currently the reset handler was always called to deassert the reset
line because assert the line was done during probe. Now if we want to
support pm by turn of the supply we need to call this routine twice and
the i2c_lock_bus is done twice too. To simplify that we can drop the
state and just do a reset in one go. So a future pm operation don't need
to lock the i2c bus twice.
