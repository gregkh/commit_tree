KVM: x86: fix presentation of TSX feature in ARCH_CAPABILITIES

KVM does not implement MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL, so it must not be presented
to the guests.  It is also confusing to have !ARCH_CAP_TSX_CTRL_MSR &&
!RTM && ARCH_CAP_TAA_NO: lack of MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL suggests TSX was not
hidden (it actually was), yet the value says that TSX is not vulnerable
to microarchitectural data sampling.  Fix both.
