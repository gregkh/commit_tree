EDAC/ghes: Remove intermediate buffer pvt->detail_location

detail_location[] is used to collect two location strings so they can
be passed as one to trace_mc_event(). Instead of having an extra copy
step, assemble the location string in other_detail[] from the
beginning.

Using other_detail[] to call trace_mc_event() is now the same as in
edac_mc.c and code can be unified.
