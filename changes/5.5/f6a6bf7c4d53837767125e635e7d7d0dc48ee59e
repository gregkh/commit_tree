cifs: switch servers depending on binding state

Currently a lot of the code to initialize a connection & session uses
the cifs_ses as input. But depending on if we are opening a new session
or a new channel we need to use different server pointers.

Add a "binding" flag in cifs_ses and a helper function that returns
the server ptr a session should use (only in the sess establishment
code path).
