staging: wfx: load firmware

A firmware is necessary to run the chip. wfx_init_device() is in charge
of loading firmware on chip and doing low level initialization.

Firmwares for WF200 are available here:

Note that firmware are encrypted. Driver checks that key used to encrypt
firmware match with key burned into chip.

Currently, "C0" key is used for production chips.
