usb: usb251xb: add pm_ops

Currently the driver don't support pm_ops. These ops are not necessary
if the supply isn't switchable (always on). This assumptions seems to be
wrong because no one needs a powered hub during suspend-to-ram/disk.

So adding simple_dev_pm_ops to be able to switch off the hub during
suspend and to restore the config after a resume operation.
