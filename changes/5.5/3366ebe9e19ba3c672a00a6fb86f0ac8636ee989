powerpc/pseries: address checkpatch warnings in dlpar_offline_cpu

Remove some stray blank lines, convert a printk to pr_warn, and
address a line length violation.

One functional change: use WARN_ON instead of BUG_ON in case H_PROD of
a ceded thread yields an unexpected result from the platform. We can
expect this code path to get uninterruptibly stuck in __cpu_die() if
this happens, but that's more desirable than crashing.
