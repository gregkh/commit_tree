io_uring: ensure workqueue offload grabs ring mutex for poll list

A previous commit moved the locking for the async sqthread, but didn't
take into account that the io-wq workers still need it. We can't use
req->in_async for this anymore as both the sqthread and io-wq workers
set it, gate the need for locking on io_wq_current_is_worker() instead.
