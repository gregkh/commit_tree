uio: fix irq init with dt support & irq not defined

This change also does a bit of a unification for the IRQ init code.

But the actual problem is that UIO_IRQ_NONE == 0, so for the DT case where
UIO_IRQ_NONE gets assigned to `uioinfo->irq`, a 2nd initialization will get
triggered (for the IRQ) and this one will exit via `goto bad1`.

As far as things seem to go, the only case where UIO_IRQ_NONE seems valid,
is when using a device-tree. The driver has some legacy support for old
platform_data structures. It looks like, for platform_data a non-existent
IRQ is an invalid case (or was considered an invalid case).
Which is why -ENXIO is treated only when a DT is used.
