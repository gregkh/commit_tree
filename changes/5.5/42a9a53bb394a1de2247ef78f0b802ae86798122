mm: vmscan: protect shrinker idr replace with CONFIG_MEMCG

Since commit 0a432dcbeb32 ("mm: shrinker: make shrinker not depend on
memcg kmem"), shrinkers' idr is protected by CONFIG_MEMCG instead of
CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM, so it makes no sense to protect shrinker idr replace
with CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM.

And in the CONFIG_MEMCG && CONFIG_SLOB case, shrinker_idr contains only
shrinker, and it is deferred_split_shrinker.  But it is never actually
called, since idr_replace() is never compiled due to the wrong #ifdef.
The deferred_split_shrinker all the time is staying in half-registered
state, and it's never called for subordinate mem cgroups.
