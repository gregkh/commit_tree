net: ipv6: add net argument to ip6_dst_lookup_flow

This will be used in the conversion of ipv6_stub to ip6_dst_lookup_flow,
as some modules currently pass a net argument without a socket to
ip6_dst_lookup. This is equivalent to commit 343d60aada5a ("ipv6: change
ipv6_stub_impl.ipv6_dst_lookup to take net argument").
