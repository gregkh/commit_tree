scsi: target: fix SendTargets=All string compares

strncmp is currently used for "SendTargets" key and "All" value matching
without checking for trailing garbage. This means that Text request PDUs
with garbage such as "SendTargetsPlease=All" and "SendTargets=Alle" are
processed successfully as if they were "SendTargets=All" requests.
