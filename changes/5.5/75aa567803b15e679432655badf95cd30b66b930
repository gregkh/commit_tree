arm64: dts: rockchip: fix sdmmc detection on boot on rk3328-roc-cc

With working GPIO, during init the GPIO state s reset.
This causes the sdmmc regulator to shut down, preventing detection.
Removing and replacing the card will allow it to be detected, but that should not be necessary.
Fix this by setting the regulator on at boot.
