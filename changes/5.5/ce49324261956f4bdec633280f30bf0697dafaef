drm/panfrost: Use mutex_trylock in panfrost_gem_purge

Lockdep reports a circular locking dependency with pages_lock taken in
the shrinker callback. The deadlock can't actually happen with current
users at least as a BO will never be purgeable when pages_lock is held.
To be safe, let's use mutex_trylock() instead and bail if a BO is locked
already.
