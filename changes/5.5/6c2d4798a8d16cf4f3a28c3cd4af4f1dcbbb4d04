new helper: lookup_positive_unlocked()

Most of the callers of lookup_one_len_unlocked() treat negatives are
ERR_PTR(-ENOENT).  Provide a helper that would do just that.  Note
that a pinned positive dentry remains positive - it's ->d_inode is
stable, etc.; a pinned _negative_ dentry can become positive at any
point as long as you are not holding its parent at least shared.
So using lookup_one_len_unlocked() needs to be careful;
lookup_positive_unlocked() is safer and that's what the callers
end up open-coding anyway.
