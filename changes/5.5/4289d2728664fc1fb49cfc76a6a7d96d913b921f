KVM: retpolines: x86: eliminate retpoline from vmx.c exit handlers

It's enough to check the exit value and issue a direct call to avoid
the retpoline for all the common vmexit reasons.

Of course CONFIG_RETPOLINE already forbids gcc to use indirect jumps
while compiling all switch() statements, however switch() would still
allow the compiler to bisect the case value. It's more efficient to
prioritize the most frequent vmexits instead.

The halt may be slow paths from the point of the guest, but not
necessarily so from the point of the host if the host runs at full CPU
capacity and no host CPU is ever left idle.
