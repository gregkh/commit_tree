net: sched: extract qstats update code into functions

Extract common code that increments cpu_qstats counters into standalone act
API functions. Change hardware offloaded actions that use percpu counter
allocation to use the new functions instead of accessing cpu_qstats
directly.

This commit doesn't change functionality.
