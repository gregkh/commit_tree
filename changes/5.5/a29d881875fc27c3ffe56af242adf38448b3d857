drm/dp_mst: Refactor drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req()

There's a couple of changes here, so to summarize:

* Remove the big ugly mgr->up_req_recv.have_eomt conditional to save on
  indenting
* Store &mgr->up_req_recv.initial_hdr in a variable so we don't keep
  going over 80 character long lines
* De-duplicate code for calling drm_dp_send_up_ack_reply() and getting
  the MSTB via it's GUID
* Remove all of the duplicate calls to memset() and just use a goto
  instead
* Actually do line wrapping
* Remove the unnecessary if (mstb) check before calling
  drm_dp_mst_topology_put_mstb() - we are guaranteed to always have
  mstb != NULL at that point in the function
