KVM: nVMX: Load GUEST_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL MSR on VM-Entry

Add condition to prepare_vmcs02 which loads IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL on
VM-entry if the "load IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL" bit on the VM-entry control
is set. Use SET_MSR_OR_WARN() rather than directly writing to the field
to avoid overwrite by atomic_switch_perf_msrs().
