scsi: qla2xxx: Retry PLOGI on FC-NVMe PRLI failure

Current code will send PRLI with FC-NVMe bit set for the targets which
support only FCP. This may result into issue with targets which do not
understand NVMe and will go into a strange state. This patch would restart
the login process by going back to PLOGI state. The PLOGI state will force
the target to respond to correct PRLI request.
