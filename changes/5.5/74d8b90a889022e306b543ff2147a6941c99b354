x86/asm/crypto: Annotate local functions

Use the newly added SYM_FUNC_START_LOCAL to annotate beginnings of all
functions which do not have ".globl" annotation, but their endings are
annotated by ENDPROC. This is needed to balance ENDPROC for tools that
generate debuginfo.

These function names are not prepended with ".L" as they might appear in
call traces and they wouldn't be visible after such change.

To be symmetric, the functions' ENDPROCs are converted to the new
SYM_FUNC_END.
