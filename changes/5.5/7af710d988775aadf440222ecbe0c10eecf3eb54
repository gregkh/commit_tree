xtensa: add XIP kernel support

XIP (eXecute In Place) kernel image is the image that can be run
directly from ROM, using RAM only for writable data.

XIP xtensa kernel differs from regular xtensa kernel in the following
ways:
- it has exception/IRQ vectors merged into text section. No vectors
  relocation takes place at kernel startup.
- .data/.bss location must be specified in the kernel configuration,
  its content is copied there in the _startup function.
- .init.text is merged with the rest of text and is executed from ROM.
- when MMU is used the virtual address where the kernel will be mapped
  must be specified in the kernel configuration. It may be in the KSEG
  or in the KIO, __pa macro is adjusted to be able to handle both.
