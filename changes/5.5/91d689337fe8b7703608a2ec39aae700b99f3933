crypto: blake2b - add blake2b generic implementation

The patch brings support of several BLAKE2 variants (2b with various
digest lengths).  The keyed digest is supported, using tfm->setkey call.
The in-tree user will be btrfs (for checksumming), we're going to use
the BLAKE2b-256 variant.

The code is reference implementation taken from the official sources and
modified in terms of kernel coding style (whitespace, comments, uintXX_t
-> uXX types, removed unused prototypes and #ifdefs, removed testing
code, changed secure_zero_memory -> memzero_explicit, used own helpers
for unaligned reads/writes and rotations).

Further changes removed sanity checks of key length or output size,
these values are verified in the crypto API callbacks or hardcoded in
shash_alg and not exposed to users.
