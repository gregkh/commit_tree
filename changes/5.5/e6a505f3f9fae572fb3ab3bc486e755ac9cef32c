dm clone metadata: Track exact changes per transaction

Extend struct dirty_map with a second bitmap which tracks the exact
regions that were hydrated during the current metadata transaction.

Moreover, fix __flush_dmap() to only commit the metadata of the regions
that were hydrated during the current transaction.

This is required by the following commits to fix a data corruption bug.
