drm/amdgpu: Add DC feature mask to disable fractional pwm

[Why]

Some LED panel drivers might not like fractional PWM. In such cases,
backlight flickering may be observed.

[How]

Add a DC feature mask to disable fractional PWM, and associate it with
the preexisting dc_config flag.

The flag is only plumbed through the dmcu firmware, so plumb it through
the driver path as well.

To disable, add the following to the linux cmdline:
amdgpu.dcfeaturemask=0x4
