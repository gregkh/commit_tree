mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix use of uninitialized adjacency index

When mlxsw_sp_adj_discard_write() is called for the first time, the
value stored in 'mlxsw_sp->router->adj_discard_index' is invalid, as
indicated by 'mlxsw_sp->router->adj_discard_index_valid' being set to
'false'.

In this case, we should not use the value initially stored in
'mlxsw_sp->router->adj_discard_index' (0) and instead use the value
allocated later in the function.
