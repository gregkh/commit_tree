drm/amdgpu: fix potential double drop fence reference

The object fence is not set to NULL after its reference is dropped. As a
result, its reference may be dropped again if error occurs after that,
which may lead to a use after free bug. To avoid the issue, fence is
explicitly set to NULL after dropping its reference.
