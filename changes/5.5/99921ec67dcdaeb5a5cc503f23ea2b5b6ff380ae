ALSA: firewire-lib: tune the maximum available size of PCM period

Linux driver for 1394 OHCI controller voluntarily flushes isoc context
when total size of accumulated context header reached PAGE_SIZE. This
kicks tasklet for the isoc context. This is inconvenient to process
runtime of PCM substream.

This commit adds a restriction of the maximum size of PCM period to
avoid this behaviour.
