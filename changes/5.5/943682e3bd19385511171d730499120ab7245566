drm/i915: Introduce Jasper Lake PCH

The Jasper Lake PCH follows ICP/TGP's south display behavior and is
identical to MCC graphics-wise except that it does not use the unusual
(port C -> TC1) pin mapping that MCC does.

Also, it turns out the extra PCH ID that we had previously thought was a
form of MCC is actually a second ID for JSP (i.e., port C uses the port
C pins instead of the TC1 pins).

v2:
 - Also update the port masks (not just the pin table) in
   mcc_hpd_irq_setup.  (Vivek)

v3:
 - Break jsp_hpd_irq_setup out into its own function for clarity.
