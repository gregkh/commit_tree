media: ov6650: Fix control handler not freed on init error

Since commit afd9690c72c3 ("[media] ov6650: convert to the control
framework"), if an error occurs during initialization of a control
handler, resources possibly allocated to the handler are not freed
before device initialiaton is aborted.  Fix it.
