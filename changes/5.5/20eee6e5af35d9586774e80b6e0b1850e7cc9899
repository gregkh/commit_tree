HID: steam: Fix input device disappearing

The `connected` value for wired devices was not properly initialized,
it must be set to `true` upon creation, because wired devices do not
generate connection events.

When a raw client (the Steam Client) uses the device, the input device
is destroyed. Then, when the raw client finishes, it must be recreated.
But since the `connected` variable was false this never happended.
