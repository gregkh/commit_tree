platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix ACPI errors caused by passing 0 as input size

The AML code implementing the WMI methods creates a variable length
field to hold the input data we pass like this:

        CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x0C, DSZI)
        Local5 = DSZI /* \HWMC.DSZI */
        CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, (Local5 * 0x08), DAIN)

If we pass 0 as bios_args.datasize argument then (Local5 * 0x08)
is 0 which results in these errors:

[   71.973305] ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Attempt to CreateField of length zero (20190816/dsopcode-133)
[   71.973332] ACPI Error: Aborting method \HWMC due to previous error (AE_AML_OPERAND_VALUE) (20190816/psparse-529)
[   71.973413] ACPI Error: Aborting method \_SB.WMID.WMAA due to previous error (AE_AML_OPERAND_VALUE) (20190816/psparse-529)

And in our HPWMI_WIRELESS2_QUERY calls always failing. for read commands
like HPWMI_WIRELESS2_QUERY the DSZI value is not used / checked, except for
read commands where extra input is needed to specify exactly what to read.

So for HPWMI_WIRELESS2_QUERY we can safely pass the size of the expected
output as insize to hp_wmi_perform_query(), as we are already doing for all
other HPWMI_READ commands we send. Doing so fixes these errors.
