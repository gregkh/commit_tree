PCI: Remove PCI_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN architecture whitelist

The only apparent reason for the PCI_MSI_IRQ_DOMAIN architecture
whitelist was that it requires msi.h.  Now that msi.h is mandatory in
asm-generic/Kbuild, every arch should have at least the default version,
so remove the whitelist.

Built for all the architectures that play nice with make.cross, but not
boot tested anywhere.
