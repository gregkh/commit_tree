ASoC: soc-core: merge soc_add_pcm_runtime() into soc_new_pcm_runtime()

We have soc_new_pcm_runtime() which allocs rtd and its related memory,
and     soc_add_pcm_runtime() which connects rtd to card.

But we don't need to separate these, we can alloc and connect rtd
in the same time.

Current implementation is just makes code complex.
This patch merges these into one.
