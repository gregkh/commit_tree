drm/amd/display: define parameters for abm 2.3

[Why]
Current configuration 0 is just a placeholder, and final parameters needed.
Also, configuration 1 is expected to emulate ABM 2.1 but is too aggressive.

[How]
Redefine configuration 0 with the finalized parameters, and increase the
contrast gain of configuration 1 so that it properly emulates ABM 2.1.
