cdrom: respect device capabilities during opening action

Reading the TOC only works if the device can play audio, otherwise
these commands fail (and possibly bring the device to an unhealthy
state.)

Similarly, cdrom_mmc3_profile() should only be called if the device
supports generic packet commands.
