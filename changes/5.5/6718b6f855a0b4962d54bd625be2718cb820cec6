pipe: Allow pipes to have kernel-reserved slots

Split pipe->ring_size into two numbers:

 (1) pipe->ring_size - indicates the hard size of the pipe ring.

 (2) pipe->max_usage - indicates the maximum number of pipe ring slots that
     userspace orchestrated events can fill.

This allows for a pipe that is both writable by the general kernel
notification facility and by userspace, allowing plenty of ring space for
notifications to be added whilst preventing userspace from being able to
pin too much unswappable kernel space.
