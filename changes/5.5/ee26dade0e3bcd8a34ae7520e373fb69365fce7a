libbpf: Add support for relocatable bitfields

Add support for the new field relocation kinds, necessary to support
relocatable bitfield reads. Provide macro for abstracting necessary code doing
full relocatable bitfield extraction into u64 value. Two separate macros are
provided:
- BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD macro for direct memory read-enabled BPF programs
(e.g., typed raw tracepoints). It uses direct memory dereference to extract
bitfield backing integer value.
- BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD_PROBED macro for cases where bpf_probe_read() needs
to be used to extract same backing integer value.
