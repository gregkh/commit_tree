crypto: arch - conditionalize crypto api in arch glue for lib code

For glue code that's used by Zinc, the actual Crypto API functions might
not necessarily exist, and don't need to exist either. Before this
patch, there are valid build configurations that lead to a unbuildable
kernel. This fixes it to conditionalize those symbols on the existence
of the proper config entry.
