CIFS: Respect O_SYNC and O_DIRECT flags during reconnect

Currently the client translates O_SYNC and O_DIRECT flags
into corresponding SMB create options when openning a file.
The problem is that on reconnect when the file is being
re-opened the client doesn't set those flags and it causes
a server to reject re-open requests because create options
don't match. The latter means that any subsequent system
call against that open file fail until a share is re-mounted.

Fix this by properly setting SMB create options when
re-openning files after reconnects.
