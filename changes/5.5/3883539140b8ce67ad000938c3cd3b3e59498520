of: property: Fix the semantics of of_is_ancestor_of()

The of_is_ancestor_of() function was renamed from of_link_is_valid()
based on review feedback. The rename meant the semantics of the function
had to be inverted, but this was missed in the earlier patch.

So, fix the semantics of of_is_ancestor_of() and invert the conditional
expressions where it is used.
