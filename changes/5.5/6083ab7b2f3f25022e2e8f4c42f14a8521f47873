watchdog: imx7ulp: Fix reboot hang

The following hang is observed when a 'reboot' command is issued:

# reboot
# Stopping network: OK
Stopping klogd: OK
Stopping syslogd: OK
umount: devtmpfs busy - remounted read-only
[    8.612079] EXT4-fs (mmcblk0p2): re-mounted. Opts: (null)
The system is going down NOW!
Sent SIGTERM to all processes
Sent SIGKILL to all processes
Requesting system reboot
[   10.694753] reboot: Restarting system
[   11.699008] Reboot failed -- System halted

Fix this problem by adding a .restart ops member.
