perf script: Allow --time with --reltime

The original --reltime patch forbid --time with --reltime.

But it turns out --time doesn't really care about --reltime, because the
relative time is only used at final output, while the time filtering
always works earlier on absolute time.

So just remove the check and allow combining the two options.
