compat_ioctl: reimplement SG_IO handling

There are two code locations that implement the SG_IO ioctl: the old
sg.c driver, and the generic scsi_ioctl helper that is in turn used by
multiple drivers.

To eradicate the old compat_ioctl conversion handler for the SG_IO
command, I implement a readable pair of put_sg_io_hdr() /get_sg_io_hdr()
helper functions that can be used for both compat and native mode,
and then I call this from both drivers.

For the iovec handling, there is already a compat_import_iovec() function
that can simply be called in place of import_iovec().

To avoid having to pass the compat/native state through multiple
indirections, I mark the SG_IO command itself as compatible in
fs/compat_ioctl.c and use in_compat_syscall() to figure out where
we are called from.

As a side-effect of this, the sg.c driver now also accepts the 32-bit
sg_io_hdr format in compat mode using the read/write interface, not
just ioctl. This should improve compatiblity with old 32-bit binaries,
but it would break if any application intentionally passes the 64-bit
data structure in compat mode here.
