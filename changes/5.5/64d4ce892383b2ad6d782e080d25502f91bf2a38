ext4: fix ext4_empty_dir() for directories with holes

Function ext4_empty_dir() doesn't correctly handle directories with
holes and crashes on bh->b_data dereference when bh is NULL. Reorganize
the loop to use 'offset' variable all the times instead of comparing
pointers to current direntry with bh->b_data pointer. Also add more
strict checking of '.' and '..' directory entries to avoid entering loop
in possibly invalid state on corrupted filesystems.
