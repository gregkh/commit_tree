drm/vram: Support top-down placement flag

Pinning lots of small buffer objects, such as cursors or sprites, to video
memory can lead to fragmentation, which is a problem for devices with only
a small amount of memory. As a result, framebuffer images might not get
pinned, even though there's enough space available overall.

The flag DRM_GEM_VRAM_PL_FLAG_TOPDOWN marks buffer objects to be pinned at
the high end of video memory. This leaves contiguous space available at
the memory's low end.
