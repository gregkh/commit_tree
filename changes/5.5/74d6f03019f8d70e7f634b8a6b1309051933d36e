ceph: fix geting random mds from mdsmap

For example, if we have 5 mds in the mdsmap and the states are:
m_info[5] --> [-1, 1, -1, 1, 1]

If we get a random number 1, then we should get the mds index 3 as
expected, but actually we will get index 2, which the state is -1.

The issue is that the for loop increment will advance past any "up"
MDS that was found during the while loop search.
