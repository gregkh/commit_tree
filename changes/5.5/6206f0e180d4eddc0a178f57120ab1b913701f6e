io-wq: shrink io_wq_work a bit

Currently we're using 40 bytes for the io_wq_work structure, and 16 of
those is the doubly link list node. We don't need doubly linked lists,
we always add to tail to keep things ordered, and any other use case
is list traversal with deletion. For the deletion case, we can easily
support any node deletion by keeping track of the previous entry.

This shrinks io_wq_work to 32 bytes, and subsequently io_kiock from
io_uring to 216 to 208 bytes.
