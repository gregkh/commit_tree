xfs: track best extent from cntbt lastblock scan in alloc cursor

If the size lookup lands in the last block of the by-size btree, the
near mode algorithm scans the entire block for the extent with best
available locality. In preparation for similar best available
extent tracking across both btrees, extend the allocation cursor
with best extent data and lift the associated state from the cntbt
last block scan code. No functional changes.
