tty: serial: pch_uart: correct usage of dma_unmap_sg

Per Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt,
To unmap a scatterlist, just call:
	dma_unmap_sg(dev, sglist, nents, direction);

.. note::

	The 'nents' argument to the dma_unmap_sg call must be
	the _same_ one you passed into the dma_map_sg call,
	it should _NOT_ be the 'count' value _returned_ from the
	dma_map_sg call.

However in the driver, priv->nent is directly assigned with value
returned from dma_map_sg, and dma_unmap_sg use priv->nent for unmap,
this breaks the API usage.

So introduce a new entry orig_nent to remember 'nents'.
