ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: hda-dai: fix oops on hda_link .hw_free

When the PCM_PARAM IPC fails while configuring the FE, the kernel
oopses in the HDaudio link DMA .hw_free operation. The root cause is a
NULL dma_data since the BE .hw_params was never called by the SOC
core.

This error can also happen if the HDaudio link DMA configuration IPC
fails in the BE .hw_params.

This patches makes sure the dma_data is properly saved in .hw_params,
and tested before being use in hw_free.
