drm/bridge: dw-hdmi: Add Dynamic Range and Mastering InfoFrame support

Add support for configuring Dynamic Range and Mastering InfoFrame from
the hdr_output_metadata connector property.

This patch adds a use_drm_infoframe flag to dw_hdmi_plat_data that platform
drivers use to signal when Dynamic Range and Mastering infoframes is supported.
This flag is needed because Amlogic GXBB and GXL report same DW-HDMI version,
and only GXL support DRM InfoFrame.

These changes were based on work done by Zheng Yang <zhengyang@rock-chips.com>
to support DRM InfoFrame on the Rockchip 4.4 BSP kernel at [1] and [2]
