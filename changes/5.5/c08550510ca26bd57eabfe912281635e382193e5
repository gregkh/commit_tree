x86/fpu: Shrink space allocated for xstate_comp_offsets

commit 8ff925e10f2c ("x86/xsaves: Clean up code in xstate offsets
computation in xsave area") introduced an allocation of 64 entries for
xstate_comp_offsets while the code only handles up to XFEATURE_MAX entries.

For this reason xstate_offsets and xstate_sizes are already defined with
the explicit XFEATURE_MAX limit.

Do the same for compressed format for consistency sake.

As the changelog of that commit is not giving any information it's assumed
that the main idea was to cover all possible bits in xfeatures_mask, but
this doesn't explain why other variables such as the non-compacted offsets
and sizes are explicitely limited to XFEATURE_MAX.

For consistency it's better to use the XFEATURE_MAX limit everywhere and
extend it on demand when new features get implemented at the hardware
level and subsequently supported by the kernel.
