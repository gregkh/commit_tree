ALSA: usb-audio: set the interface format after resume on Dell WD19

Recently we found the headset-mic on the Dell Dock WD19 doesn't work
anymore after s3 (s2i or deep), this problem could be workarounded by
closing (pcm_close) the app and then reopening (pcm_open) the app, so
this bug is not easy to be detected by users.

When problem happens, retire_capture_urb() could still be called
periodically, but the size of captured data is always 0, it could be
a firmware bug on the dock. Anyway I found after resuming, the
snd_usb_pcm_prepare() will be called, and if we forcibly run
set_format() to set the interface and its endpoint, the capture
size will be normal again. This problem and workaound also apply to
playback.

To fix it in the kernel, add a quirk to let set_format() run
forcibly once after resume.
