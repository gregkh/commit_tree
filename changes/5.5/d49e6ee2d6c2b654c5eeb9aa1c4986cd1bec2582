counter: Simplify the count_read and count_write callbacks

The count_read and count_write callbacks are simplified to pass val as
unsigned long rather than as an opaque data structure. The opaque
counter_count_read_value and counter_count_write_value structures,
counter_count_value_type enum, and relevant counter_count_read_value_set
and counter_count_write_value_get functions, are removed as they are no
longer used.
