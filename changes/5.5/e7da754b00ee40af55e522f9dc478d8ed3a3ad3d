drm/amdgpu: fix an UMC hw arbitrator bug(v3)

issue:
the UMC6 h/w bug is that when MCLK is doing the switch
in the middle of a page access being preempted by high
priority client (e.g. DISPLAY) then UMC and the mclk switch
would stuck there due to deadlock

how:
fixed by disabling auto PreChg for UMC to avoid high
priority client preempting other client's access on
the same page, thus the deadlock could be avoided

v2:
put the patch in callback of UMC6
v3:
rename the callback to "init_registers"
