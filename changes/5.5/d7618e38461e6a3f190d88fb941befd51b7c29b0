staging: qlge: Fix irq masking in INTx mode

Tracing the driver operation reveals that the INTR_EN_EN bit (per-queue
interrupt control) does not immediately prevent rx completion interrupts
when the device is operating in INTx mode. This leads to interrupts being
raised while napi is scheduled/running. Those interrupts are ignored by
qlge_isr() and falsely reported as IRQ_NONE thanks to the irq_cnt scheme.
This in turn can cause frames to loiter in the receive queue until a later
frame leads to another rx interrupt that will schedule napi.

Use the INTR_EN_EI bit (master interrupt control) instead.
