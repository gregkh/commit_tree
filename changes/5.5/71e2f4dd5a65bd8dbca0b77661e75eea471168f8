MIPS: Fork loongson2ef from loongson64

As later model of GSx64 family processors including 2-series-soc have
similar design with initial loongson3a while loongson2e/f seems less
identical, we separate loongson2e/f support code out of mach-loongson64
to make our life easier.

This patch contains mostly file moving works.
