MIPS: Check Loongson3 LL/SC errata workaround correctness

When Loongson3 LL/SC errata workarounds are enabled (ie.
CONFIG_CPU_LOONGSON3_WORKAROUNDS=y) run a tool to scan through the
compiled kernel & ensure that the workaround is applied correctly. That
is, ensure that:

  - Every LL or LLD instruction is preceded by a sync instruction.

  - Any branches from within an LL/SC loop to outside of that loop
    target a sync instruction.

Reasoning for these conditions can be found by reading the comment above
the definition of __SYNC_loongson3_war in arch/mips/include/asm/sync.h.

This tool will help ensure that we don't inadvertently introduce code
paths that miss the required workarounds.
