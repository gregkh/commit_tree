y2038: syscalls: change remaining timeval to __kernel_old_timeval

All of the remaining syscalls that pass a timeval (gettimeofday, utime,
futimesat) can trivially be changed to pass a __kernel_old_timeval
instead, which has a compatible layout, but avoids ambiguity with
the timeval type in user space.
