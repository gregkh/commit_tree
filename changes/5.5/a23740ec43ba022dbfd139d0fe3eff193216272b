bpf: Track contents of read-only maps as scalars

Maps that are read-only both from BPF program side and user space side
have their contents constant, so verifier can track referenced values
precisely and use that knowledge for dead code elimination, branch
pruning, etc. This patch teaches BPF verifier how to do this.
