x86/traps: Disentangle the 32-bit and 64-bit doublefault code

The 64-bit doublefault handler is much nicer than the 32-bit one.
As a first step toward unifying them, make the 64-bit handler
self-contained.  This should have no effect no functional effect
except in the odd case of x86_64 with CONFIG_DOUBLEFAULT=n in which
case it will change the logging a bit.

This also gets rid of CONFIG_DOUBLEFAULT configurability on 64-bit
kernels.  It didn't do anything useful -- CONFIG_DOUBLEFAULT=n
didn't actually disable doublefault handling on x86_64.
