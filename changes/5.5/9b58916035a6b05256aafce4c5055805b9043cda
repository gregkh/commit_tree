iio: hdc100x: fix iio_triggered_buffer_{predisable,postenable} positions

The iio_triggered_buffer_postenable() hook should be called first to
attach the poll function and the iio_triggered_buffer_predisable() hook
should be called last in the predisable hook.

This change updates the driver to attach/detach the poll func in the
correct order.
