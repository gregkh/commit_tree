spi: sprd: convert transfer word delay to spi_delay struct

The Spreadtrum SPI driver is the only user of the `word_delay` field in
the `spi_transfer` struct.

This change converts the field to use the `spi_delay` struct. This also
enforces the users to specify the delay unit to be `SPI_DELAY_UNIT_SCK`.
