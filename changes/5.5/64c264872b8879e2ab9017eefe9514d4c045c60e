RDMA/efa: Clear the admin command buffer prior to its submission

We cannot rely on the entry memcpy as we only copy the actual size of the
command, the rest of the bytes must be memset to zero.

Currently providing non-zero memory will not have any user visible impact.
However, since admin commands are extendable (in a backwards compatible
way) everything beyond the size of the command must be cleared to prevent
issues in the future.
