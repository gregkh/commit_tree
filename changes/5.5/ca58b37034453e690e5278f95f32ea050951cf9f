backlight: pwm_bl: Switch to power-of-2 base for fixed-point math

Using a power-of-2 instead of power-of-10 base makes the computations
much cheaper. 2^16 is safe; retval never becomes more than 2^48 +
2^32/2. On a 32 bit platform, the very expensive 64/32 division at the
end of cie1931() instead becomes essentially free (a shift by 32 is
just a register rename).
