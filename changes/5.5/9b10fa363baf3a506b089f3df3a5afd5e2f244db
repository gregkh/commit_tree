spi: zynq-qspi: Keep the naming consistent across the driver

In this driver (and also in a lot of other drivers in drivers/spi/),
the spi_controller structure is sometimes referred as 'ctlr' and
sometimes as 'ctrl'. Grepping there shows that 'ctlr' seems to be more
common so keep the naming consistent in this driver and s/ctrl/ctlr/.
