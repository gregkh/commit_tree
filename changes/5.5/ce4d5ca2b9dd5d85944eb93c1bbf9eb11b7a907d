arm/arm64: Make use of the SMCCC 1.1 wrapper

Rather than directly choosing which function to use based on
psci_ops.conduit, use the new arm_smccc_1_1 wrapper instead.

In some cases we still need to do some operations based on the
conduit, but the code duplication is removed.

No functional change.
