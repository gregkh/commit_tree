mac80211: Import airtime calculation code from mt76

Felix recently added code to calculate airtime of packets to the mt76
driver. Import this into mac80211 so we can use it for airtime queue limit
calculations.

The airtime.c file is copied verbatim from the mt76 driver, and adjusted to
be usable in mac80211. This involves:

- Switching to mac80211 data structures.
- Adding support for 160 MHz channels and HE mode.
- Moving the symbol and duration calculations around a bit to avoid
  rounding with the higher rates and longer symbol times used for HE rates.

The per-rate TX rate calculation is also split out to its own function so
it can be used directly for the AQL calculations later.

[fix HE_GROUP_IDX() to use 3 * bw, since there are 3 _gi values]
