net/sonic: Add mutual exclusion for accessing shared state

The netif_stop_queue() call in sonic_send_packet() races with the
netif_wake_queue() call in sonic_interrupt(). This causes issues
like "NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0 (macsonic): transmit queue 0 timed out".
Fix this by disabling interrupts when accessing tx_skb[] and next_tx.
Update a comment to clarify the synchronization properties.
