s390/ftrace: save traced function caller

A typical backtrace acquired from ftraced function currently looks like
the following (e.g. for "path_openat"):

arch_stack_walk+0x15c/0x2d8
stack_trace_save+0x50/0x68
stack_trace_call+0x15a/0x3b8
ftrace_graph_caller+0x0/0x1c
0x3e0007e3c98 <- ftraced function caller (should be do_filp_open+0x7c/0xe8)
do_open_execat+0x70/0x1b8
__do_execve_file.isra.0+0x7d8/0x860
__s390x_sys_execve+0x56/0x68
system_call+0xdc/0x2d8

Note random "0x3e0007e3c98" stack value as ftraced function caller. This
value causes either imprecise unwinder result or unwinding failure.
That "0x3e0007e3c98" comes from r14 of ftraced function stack frame, which
it haven't had a chance to initialize since the very first instruction
calls ftrace code ("ftrace_caller"). (ftraced function might never
save r14 as well). Nevertheless according to s390 ABI any function
is called with stack frame allocated for it and r14 contains return
address. "ftrace_caller" itself is called with "brasl %r0,ftrace_caller".
So, to fix this issue simply always save traced function caller onto
ftraced function stack frame.
