spi: dw: Remove runtime PM enable/disable from common part of the driver

Committed version of the commit b9fc2d207e54 ("spi: dw: Move runtime PM
enable/disable from common to platform driver part") does not include by
some reason changes to drivers/spi/spi-dw.c that were part of the original
patch sent to the mailing list.

Complete the code move by doing those changes now.
