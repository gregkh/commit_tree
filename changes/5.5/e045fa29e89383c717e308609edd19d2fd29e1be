PCI/MSI: Fix incorrect MSI-X masking on resume

When a driver enables MSI-X, msix_program_entries() reads the MSI-X Vector
Control register for each vector and saves it in desc->masked.  Each
register is 32 bits and bit 0 is the actual Mask bit.

When we restored these registers during resume, we previously set the Mask
bit if *any* bit in desc->masked was set instead of when the Mask bit
itself was set:

  pci_restore_state
    pci_restore_msi_state
      __pci_restore_msix_state
        for_each_pci_msi_entry
          msix_mask_irq(entry, entry->masked)   <-- entire u32 word
            __pci_msix_desc_mask_irq(desc, flag)
              mask_bits = desc->masked & ~PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_CTRL_MASKBIT
              if (flag)       <-- testing entire u32, not just bit 0
                mask_bits |= PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_CTRL_MASKBIT
              writel(mask_bits, desc_addr + PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_VECTOR_CTRL)

This means that after resume, MSI-X vectors were masked when they shouldn't
be, which leads to timeouts like this:

  nvme nvme0: I/O 978 QID 3 timeout, completion polled

On resume, set the Mask bit only when the saved Mask bit from suspend was
set.

This should remove the need for 19ea025e1d28 ("nvme: Add quirk for Kingston
NVME SSD running FW E8FK11.T").
