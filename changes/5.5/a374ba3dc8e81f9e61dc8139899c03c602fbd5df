staging: wfx: relocate wfx_fill_sl_key() in secure_link.h

"Secure link" feature is not available in in-tree driver (because it
depends on mbedtls). Thus, secure_link.h only empty functions.

Module parameter "slk_key" and associated function wfx_fill_sl_key() had
an unjustifiable place in main.c. This patch relocate them to
secure_link.h.

BTW, content of wfx_fill_sl_key() is now useless. Just keep a warning if
user try to use "slk_key" attribute (unsupported by this driver).
