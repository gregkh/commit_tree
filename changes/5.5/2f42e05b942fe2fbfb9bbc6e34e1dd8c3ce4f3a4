dmaengine: k3dma: Avoid null pointer traversal

In some cases we seem to submit two transactions in a row, which
causes us to lose track of the first. If we then cancel the
request, we may still get an interrupt, which traverses a null
ds_run value.

So try to avoid starting a new transaction if the ds_run value
is set.

While this patch avoids the null pointer crash, I've had some
reports of the k3dma driver still getting confused, which
suggests the ds_run/ds_done value handling still isn't quite
right. However, I've not run into an issue recently with it
so I think this patch is worth pushing upstream to avoid the
crash.
