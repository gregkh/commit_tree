selftests/bpf: Integrate verbose verifier log into test_progs

Add exra level of verboseness, activated by -vvv argument. When -vv is
specified, verbose libbpf and verifier log (level 1) is output, even for
successful tests. With -vvv, verifier log goes to level 2.

This is extremely useful to debug verifier failures, as well as just see the
state and flow of verification. Before this, you'd have to go and modify
load_program()'s source code inside libbpf to specify extra log_level flags,
which is suboptimal to say the least.

Currently -vv and -vvv triggering verifier output is integrated into
test_stub's bpf_prog_load as well as bpf_verif_scale.c tests.
