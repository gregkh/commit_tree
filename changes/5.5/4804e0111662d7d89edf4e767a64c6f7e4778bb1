perf stat: Use affinity for opening events

Restructure the event opening in perf stat to cycle through the events
by CPU after setting affinity to that CPU.

This eliminates IPI overhead in the perf API.

We have to loop through the CPU in the outter builtin-stat code instead
of leaving that to low level functions.

It has to change the weak group fallback strategy slightly.  Since we
cannot easily undo the opens for other CPUs move the weak group retry to
a separate loop.

Before with a large test case with 94 CPUs:

  % time     seconds  usecs/call     calls    errors syscall
  ------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------
   42.75    4.050910          67     60046       110 perf_event_open

After:

   26.86    0.944396          16     58069       110 perf_event_open

(the number changes slightly because the weak group retries
work differently and the test case relies on weak groups)

Committer notes:

Added one of the hunks in a patch provided by Andi after I noticed that
the "event times" 'perf test' entry was segfaulting.
