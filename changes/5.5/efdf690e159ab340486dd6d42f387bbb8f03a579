backlight: pwm_bl: Fix cie1913 comments and constant

The "break-even" point for the two formulas is L==8, which is also
what the code actually implements. [Incidentally, at that point one
has Y=0.008856, not 0.08856].

Moreover, all the sources I can find say the linear factor is 903.3
rather than 902.3, which makes sense since then the formulas agree at
L==8, both yielding the 0.008856 figure to four significant digits.
