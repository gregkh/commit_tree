drm/i915: introduce intel_memory_region

Support memory regions, as defined by a given (start, end), and allow
creating GEM objects which are backed by said region. The immediate goal
here is to have something to represent our device memory, but later on
we also want to represent every memory domain with a region, so stolen,
shmem, and of course device. At some point we are probably going to want
use a common struct here, such that we are better aligned with say TTM.
