ftrace/x86: Add a counter to test function_graph with direct

As testing for direct calls from the function graph tracer adds a little
overhead (which is a lot when tracing every function), add a counter that
can be used to test if function_graph tracer needs to test for a direct
caller or not.

It would have been nicer if we could use a static branch, but the static
branch logic fails when used within the function graph tracer trampoline.
