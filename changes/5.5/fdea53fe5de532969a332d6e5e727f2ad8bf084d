ALSA: timer: Limit max amount of slave instances

The fuzzer tries to open the timer instances as much as possible, and
this may cause a system hiccup easily.  We've already introduced the
cap for the max number of available instances for the h/w timers, and
we should put such a limit also to the slave timers, too.

This patch introduces the limit to the multiple opened slave timers.
The upper limit is hard-coded to 1000 for now, which should suffice
for any practical usages up to now.
