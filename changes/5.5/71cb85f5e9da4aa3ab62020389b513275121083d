ASoC: soc-core: call snd_soc_register_dai() from snd_soc_register_dais()

ALSA SoC has 2 functions.
snd_soc_register_dai()  is used from topology
snd_soc_register_dais() is used from snd_soc_add_component()

In general, people think like _dai() is called from _dais()
with for loop. But in reality, these are very similar
but different implementation.
We shouldn't have duplicated and confusing implementation.

This patch calls snd_soc_register_dai() from snd_soc_register_dais()
