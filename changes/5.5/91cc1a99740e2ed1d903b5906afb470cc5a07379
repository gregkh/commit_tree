bpf: Annotate context types

Annotate BPF program context types with program-side type and kernel-side type.
This type information is used by the verifier. btf_get_prog_ctx_type() is
used in the later patches to verify that BTF type of ctx in BPF program matches to
kernel expected ctx type. For example, the XDP program type is:
BPF_PROG_TYPE(BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP, xdp, struct xdp_md, struct xdp_buff)
That means that XDP program should be written as:
int xdp_prog(struct xdp_md *ctx) { ... }
