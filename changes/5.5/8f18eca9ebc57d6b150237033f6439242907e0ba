HID: ite: Add USB id match for Acer SW5-012 keyboard dock

The Acer SW5-012 2-in-1 keyboard dock uses a Synaptics S91028 touchpad
which is connected to an ITE 8595 USB keyboard controller chip.

This keyboard has the same quirk for its rfkill / airplane mode hotkey as
other keyboards with the ITE 8595 chip, it only sends a single release
event when pressed and released, it never sends a press event.

This commit adds this keyboards USB id to the hid-ite id-table, fixing
the rfkill key not working on this keyboard.
