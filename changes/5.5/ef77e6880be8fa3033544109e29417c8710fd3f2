x86/asm: Annotate local pseudo-functions

Use the newly added SYM_CODE_START_LOCAL* to annotate beginnings of
all pseudo-functions (those ending with END until now) which do not
have ".globl" annotation. This is needed to balance END for tools that
generate debuginfo. Note that ENDs are switched to SYM_CODE_END too so
that everybody can see the pairing.

C-like functions (which handle frame ptr etc.) are not annotated here,
hence SYM_CODE_* macros are used here, not SYM_FUNC_*. Note that the
32bit version of early_idt_handler_common already had ENDPROC -- switch
that to SYM_CODE_END for the same reason as above (and to be the same as
64bit).

While early_idt_handler_common is LOCAL, it's name is not prepended with
".L" as it happens to appear in call traces.

bad_get_user*, and bad_put_user are now aligned, as they are separate
functions. They do not mind to be aligned -- no need to be compact
there.

early_idt_handler_common is aligned now too, as it is after
early_idt_handler_array, so as well no need to be compact there.

verify_cpu is self-standing and included in other .S files, so align it
too.

The others have alignment preserved to what it used to be (using the
_NOALIGN variant of macros).
