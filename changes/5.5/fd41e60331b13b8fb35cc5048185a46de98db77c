bfq-iosched: stop using blkg->stat_bytes and ->stat_ios

When used on cgroup1, bfq uses the blkg->stat_bytes and ->stat_ios
from blk-cgroup core to populate six stat knobs.  blk-cgroup core is
moving away from blkg_rwstat to improve scalability and won't be able
to support this usage.

It isn't like the sharing gains all that much.  Let's break it out to
dedicated rwstat counters which are updated when on cgroup1.  This
makes use of bfqg_*rwstat*() helpers outside of
CONFIG_BFQ_CGROUP_DEBUG.  Move them out.

v2: Compile fix when !CONFIG_BFQ_CGROUP_DEBUG.
