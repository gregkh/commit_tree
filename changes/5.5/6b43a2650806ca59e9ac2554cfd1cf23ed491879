can: m_can: add support for handling arbitration error

The Bosch MCAN hardware (3.1.0 and above) supports interrupt flag to
detect Protocol error in arbitration phase.

Transmit error statistics is currently not updated from the MCAN driver.
Protocol error in arbitration phase is a TX error and the network
statistics should be updated accordingly.

The member "tx_error" of "struct net_device_stats" should be incremented
as arbitration is a transmit protocol error. Also "arbitration_lost" of
"struct can_device_stats" should be incremented to report arbitration
lost.
