KVM: SVM: Use wrmsr for switching between guest and host IA32_XSS on AMD

When the guest can execute the XSAVES/XRSTORS instructions, set the
hardware IA32_XSS MSR to guest/host values on VM-entry/VM-exit.

Note that vcpu->arch.ia32_xss is currently guaranteed to be 0 on AMD,
since there is no way to change it.
