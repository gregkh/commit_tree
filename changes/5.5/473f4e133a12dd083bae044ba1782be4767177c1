libbpf: Add bpf_get_link_xdp_info() function to get more XDP information

Currently, libbpf only provides a function to get a single ID for the XDP
program attached to the interface. However, it can be useful to get the
full set of program IDs attached, along with the attachment mode, in one
go. Add a new getter function to support this, using an extendible
structure to carry the information. Express the old bpf_get_link_id()
function in terms of the new function.
