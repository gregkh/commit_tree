staging: wfx: allow to send commands to chip

Chip has multiple input buffers and can handle multiple 802.11 frames
in parallel. However, other HIF command must be sent sequentially.
wsm_send_cmd() handles these requests.

This commit also add send_hif_cmd in debugfs. This file allows to send
arbitrary commands to chip. It can be used for debug and testing.
