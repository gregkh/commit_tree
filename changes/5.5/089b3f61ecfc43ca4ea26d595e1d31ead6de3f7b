regulator: core: Let boot-on regulators be powered off

Boot-on regulators are always kept on because their use_count value
is now incremented at boot time and never cleaned.

Only increment count value for alway-on regulators.
regulator_late_cleanup() is now able to power off boot-on regulators
when unused.
