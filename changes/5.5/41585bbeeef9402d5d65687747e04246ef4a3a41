selftests: add tests for clone3() with *set_tid

This tests clone3() with *set_tid to see if all desired PIDs are working
as expected. The tests are trying multiple invalid input parameters as
well as creating processes while specifying a certain PID in multiple
PID namespaces at the same time.

Additionally this moves common clone3() test code into clone3_selftests.h.
