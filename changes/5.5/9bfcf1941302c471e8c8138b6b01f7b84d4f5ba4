drm/i915: move gmbus setup down to intel_modeset_init()

Pair the gmbus setup and teardown in the same layer. This also fixes the
double gmbus teardown on the i915_driver_modeset_probe() error path.

Move the gmbus setup a bit later in the sequence to make the follow-up
refactoring easier, and to pinpoint any unexpected consequences of this
change right here, instead of the later refactoring.
