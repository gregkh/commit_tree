media: hantro: Fix H264 motion vector buffer offset

A decoded 8-bit 4:2:0 frame need memory for up to 448 bytes per
macroblock and is laid out in memory as follow:

+---------------------------+
| Y-plane   256 bytes x MBs |
+---------------------------+
| UV-plane  128 bytes x MBs |
+---------------------------+
| MV buffer  64 bytes x MBs |
+---------------------------+

The motion vector buffer offset is currently correct for 4:2:0 because
the extra space for motion vectors is overallocated with an extra
64 bytes x MBs.

Wrong offset for both destination and motion vector buffer are used
for the bottom field of field encoded content, wrong offset is
also used for 4:0:0 (monochrome) content.

Fix this by setting the motion vector address to the expected 384 bytes
x MBs offset for 4:2:0 and 256 bytes x MBs offset for 4:0:0 content.

Also use correct destination and motion vector buffer offset
for the bottom field of field encoded content.

While at it also extend the check for 4:0:0 (monochrome) to include an
additional check for High Profile (100).
