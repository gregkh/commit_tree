io_uring: clear req->result always before issuing a read/write request

req->result is cleared when io_issue_sqe() calls io_read/write_pre()
routines.  Those routines however are not called when the sqe
argument is NULL, which is the case when io_issue_sqe() is called from
io_wq_submit_work().  io_issue_sqe() may then examine a stale result if
a polled request had previously failed with -EAGAIN:

        if (ctx->flags & IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL) {
                if (req->result == -EAGAIN)
                        return -EAGAIN;

                io_iopoll_req_issued(req);
        }

and in turn cause a subsequently completed request to be re-issued in
io_wq_submit_work().
