staging: most: Change bool init to true/false

 Bool initializations should use true and false.  Bool tests don't need
 comparisons.  Based on contributions from Joe Perches, Rusty Russell
 and Bruce W Allan.

 The semantic patch that makes this report is available
 in scripts/coccinelle/misc/boolinit.cocci.
