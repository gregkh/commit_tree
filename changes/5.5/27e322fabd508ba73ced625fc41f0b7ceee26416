ASoC: SOF: define INFO_ flags in dsp_ops

Currently the INFO_ flags such as PAUSE/NO_PERIOD_WAKEUP are defined
in the SOF PCM core, which doesn't scale. To account for platform
variations, these flags need to be set in DSP ops.

This patch only moves the definitions and does not change any
functionality.
