Hence remove errornous line 5281 to make the driver actually
execute the correct initialization routine for MT7620 chips.

As it was requested by Stanislaw Gruszka remove setting values of
MIMO_PS_CFG and TX_PIN_CFG. MIMO_PS_CFG is responsible for MIMO
power-safe mode (which is disabled), hence we can drop setting it.
TX_PIN_CFG is set correctly in other functions, and as setting this
value breaks some devices, rather don't set it here during init, but
only modify it later on.
