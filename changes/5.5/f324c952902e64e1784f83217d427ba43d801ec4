ARM: dts: imx53-qsb: Use DRM bindings for the Seiko 43WVF1G panel

Currently the parallel panel that is supported is the CLAA WVGA panel,
which is the one that comes with the i.MX51 Babbage board.

The default parallel panel that goes with the imx53-qsb board is
the Seiko 43WVF1G LCD, so switch to the Seiko one.

While at it convert to DRM bindings.

The parallel display still remains disabled as the default display
port is the TVE output.
