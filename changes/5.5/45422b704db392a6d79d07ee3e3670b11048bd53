md/raid10: prevent access of uninitialized resync_pages offset

Due to unneeded multiplication in the out_free_pages portion of
r10buf_pool_alloc(), when using a 3-copy raid10 layout, it is
possible to access a resync_pages offset that has not been
initialized.  This access translates into a crash of the system
within resync_free_pages() while passing a bad pointer to
put_page().  Remove the multiplication, preventing access to the
uninitialized area.
