RDMA/srpt: Report the SCSI residual to the initiator

The code added by this patch is similar to the code that already exists in
ibmvscsis_determine_resid(). This patch has been tested by running the
following command:

strace sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sdb 12 00 00 00 60 00 -o inquiry.bin |&
    grep resid=
