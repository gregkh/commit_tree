sched/fair: Use load instead of runnable load in load_balance()

'runnable load' was originally introduced to take into account the case
where blocked load biases the load balance decision which was selecting
underutilized groups with huge blocked load whereas other groups were
overloaded.

The load is now only used when groups are overloaded. In this case,
it's worth being conservative and taking into account the sleeping
tasks that might wake up on the CPU.
