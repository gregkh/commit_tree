iio: adc: max1027: Prepare the introduction of different resolutions

Maxim's max1027/29/31 series returns the measured voltages with a
resolution of 10 bits. There is a very similar series, max1227/29/31
which works identically but uses a resolution of 12 bits. Prepare the
support for these chips by turning the 'depth' into a macro parameter
instead of hardcoding it everywhere. Also reorganize just a bit the
macros at the top to avoid repeating tens of lines when adding support
for a new chip.
