tipc: update mon's self addr when node addr generated

In commit 25b0b9c4e835 ("tipc: handle collisions of 32-bit node address
hash values"), the 32-bit node address only generated after one second
trial period expired. However the self's addr in struct tipc_monitor do
not update according to node address generated. This lead to it is
always zero as initial value. As result, sorting algorithm using this
value does not work as expected, neither neighbor monitoring framework.

In this commit, we add a fix to update self's addr when 32-bit node
address generated.
