dma-direct: unify the dma_capable definitions

Currently each architectures that wants to override dma_to_phys and
phys_to_dma also has to provide dma_capable.  But there isn't really
any good reason for that.  powerpc and mips just have copies of the
generic one minus the latests fix, and the arm one was the inspiration
for said fix, but misses the bus_dma_mask handling.
Make all architectures use the generic version instead.
