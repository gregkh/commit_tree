y2038: vdso: change timeval to __kernel_old_timeval

The gettimeofday() function in vdso uses the traditional 'timeval'
structure layout, which will be incompatible with future versions of
glibc on 32-bit architectures that use a 64-bit time_t.

This interface is problematic for y2038, when time_t overflows on 32-bit
architectures, but the plan so far is that a libc with 64-bit time_t
will not call into the gettimeofday() vdso helper at all, and only
have a method for entering clock_gettime().  This means we don't have
to fix it here, though we probably want to add a new clock_gettime()
entry point using a 64-bit version of 'struct timespec' at some point.

Changing the vdso code to use __kernel_old_timeval helps isolate
this usage from the other ones that still need to be fixed properly,
and it gets us closer to removing the 'timeval' definition from the
kernel sources.
