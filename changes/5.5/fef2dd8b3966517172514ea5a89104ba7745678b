PCI/ATS: Make pci_restore_pri_state(), pci_restore_pasid_state() private

These interfaces:

  void pci_restore_pri_state(struct pci_dev *pdev);
  void pci_restore_pasid_state(struct pci_dev *pdev);

are only used in drivers/pci and do not need to be seen by the rest of the
kernel.  Most them to drivers/pci/pci.h so they're private to the PCI
subsystem.
