fs/buffer.c: include internal.h for missing declarations

The declarations of __block_write_begin_int and guard_bio_eod are needed
from internal.h so include it to fix the following sparse warnings:

  fs/buffer.c:1930:5: warning: symbol '__block_write_begin_int' was not declared. Should it be static?
  fs/buffer.c:2994:6: warning: symbol 'guard_bio_eod' was not declared. Should it be static?
