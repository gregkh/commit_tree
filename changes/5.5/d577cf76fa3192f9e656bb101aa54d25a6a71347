ALSA: hda: hdmi - fix port numbering for ICL and TGL platforms

Semantics of port#0 differ between ICL and TGL:

 ICL port#0   -> never used for HDAudio
 ICL port#1   -> should be mapped to first pin (0x04)
 TGL port#0   -> typically not used, but HW has the support,
		 so should be mapped to first pin (0x04)
 TGL port#1   -> should be mapped to 2nd pin (0x06)

Refactor the port mapping logic to allow to take the above
differences into account. Fixes issues with HDAudio on some
TGL platforms.
