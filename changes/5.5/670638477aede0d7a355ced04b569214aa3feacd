perf/x86/intel/pt: Opportunistically use single range output mode

Most of PT implementations support Single Range Output mode, which is
an alternative to ToPA that can be used for a single contiguous buffer
and if we don't require an interrupt, that is, in AUX snapshot mode.

Now that perf core will use high order allocations for the AUX buffer,
in many cases the first condition will also be satisfied.

The two most obvious benefits of the Single Range Output mode over the
ToPA are:

 * not having to allocate the ToPA table(s),
 * not using the ToPA walk hardware.

Make use of this functionality where available and appropriate.
