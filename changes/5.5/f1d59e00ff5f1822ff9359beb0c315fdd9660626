drm/amd/amdgpu: add sw_fini interface for df_funcs

add sw_fini interface of df_funcs.
This interface will remove sysfs file of df_cntr_avail
function.

The old behavior only create sysfs of df_cntr_avail
in sw_init, but never remove it for lack of sw_fini
interface. With this,driver will report create
sysfs fail when it's loaded for the second time.
