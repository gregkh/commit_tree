net: sched: extract bstats update code into function

Extract common code that increments cpu_bstats counter into standalone act
API function. Change hardware offloaded actions that use percpu counter
allocation to use the new function instead of incrementing cpu_bstats
directly.

This commit doesn't change functionality.
