regulator: axp20x: Fix AXP22x ELDO2 regulator enable bitmask

A copy-paste error was introduced when bitmasks were converted to
macros, incorrectly setting the enable bitmask for ELDO2 to the one
for ELDO1 for the AXP22x units.

Fix it by using the correct macro.

On affected boards, ELDO1 and/or ELDO2 are used to power the camera,
which is currently unsupported.
