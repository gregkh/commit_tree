mm/mmap.c: rb_parent is not necessary in __vma_link_list()

Now we use rb_parent to get next, while this is not necessary.

When prev is NULL, this means vma should be the first element in the list.
Then next should be current first one (mm->mmap), no matter whether we
have parent or not.

After removing it, the code shows the beauty of symmetry.
