clk: qcom: gcc-sdm845: Add missing flag to votable GDSCs

On sdm845 devices, during boot we see the following warnings (unless we
have added 'pd_ignore_unused' to the kernel command line):
	hlos1_vote_mmnoc_mmu_tbu_sf_gdsc status stuck at 'on'
	hlos1_vote_mmnoc_mmu_tbu_hf1_gdsc status stuck at 'on'
	hlos1_vote_mmnoc_mmu_tbu_hf0_gdsc status stuck at 'on'
	hlos1_vote_aggre_noc_mmu_tbu2_gdsc status stuck at 'on'
	hlos1_vote_aggre_noc_mmu_tbu1_gdsc status stuck at 'on'
	hlos1_vote_aggre_noc_mmu_pcie_tbu_gdsc status stuck at 'on'
	hlos1_vote_aggre_noc_mmu_audio_tbu_gdsc status stuck at 'on'

As the name of these GDSCs suggests, they are "votable" and in downstream
DT, they all have the property "qcom,no-status-check-on-disable", which
means that we should not poll the status bit when we disable them.

Luckily the VOTABLE flag already exists and it does exactly what we need,
so let's make use of it to make the warnings disappear.
