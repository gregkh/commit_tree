drm/amdgpu: correct RLC firmwares loading sequence

Per confirmation with RLC firmware team, the RLC should
be unhalted after all RLC related firmwares uploaded.
However, in fact the RLC is unhalted immediately after
RLCG firmware uploaded. And that may causes unexpected
PSP hang on loading the succeeding RLC save restore
list related firmwares.
So, we correct the firmware loading sequence to load
RLC save restore list related firmwares before RLCG
ucode. That will help to get around this issue.
