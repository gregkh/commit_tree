KVM: arm/arm64: Factor out hypercall handling from PSCI code

We currently intertwine the KVM PSCI implementation with the general
dispatch of hypercall handling, which makes perfect sense because PSCI
is the only category of hypercalls we support.

However, as we are about to support additional hypercalls, factor out
this functionality into a separate hypercall handler file.
