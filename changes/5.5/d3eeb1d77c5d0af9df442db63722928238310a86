xen/gntdev: use mmu_interval_notifier_insert

gntdev simply wants to monitor a specific VMA for any notifier events,
this can be done straightforwardly using mmu_interval_notifier_insert()
over the VMA's VA range.

The notifier should be attached until the original VMA is destroyed.

It is unclear if any of this is even sane, but at least a lot of duplicate
code is removed.
