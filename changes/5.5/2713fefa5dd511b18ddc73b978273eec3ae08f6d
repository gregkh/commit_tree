xfs: attach dquots before performing xfs_swap_extents

Make sure we attach dquots to both inodes before swapping their extents.
This was found via manual code inspection by looking for places where we
could call xfs_trans_mod_dquot without dquots attached to inodes, and
confirmed by instrumenting the kernel and running xfs/328.
