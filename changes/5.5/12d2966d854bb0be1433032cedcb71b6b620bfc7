mm, swap: disallow swapon() on zoned block devices

A zoned block device consists of a number of zones.  Zones are either
conventional and accepting random writes or sequential and requiring
that writes be issued in LBA order from each zone write pointer
position.  For the write restriction, zoned block devices are not
suitable for a swap device.  Disallow swapon on them.
