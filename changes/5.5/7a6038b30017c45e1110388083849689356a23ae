compat_ioctl: move hci_sock handlers into driver

All these ioctl commands are compatible, so we can handle
them with a trivial wrapper in hci_sock.c and remove
the listing in fs/compat_ioctl.c.

A few of the commands pass integer arguments instead of
pointers, so for correctness skip the compat_ptr() conversion
here.
