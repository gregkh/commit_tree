spi: lpspi: fix memory leak in fsl_lpspi_probe

In fsl_lpspi_probe an SPI controller is allocated either via
spi_alloc_slave or spi_alloc_master. In all but one error cases this
controller is put by going to error handling code. This commit fixes the
case when pm_runtime_get_sync fails and it should go to the error
handling path.
