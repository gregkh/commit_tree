ALSA: aloop: Support selection of snd_timer instead of jiffies

to do synchronous audio forwarding between hardware sound card and aloop
devices. Such an audio route could look like the following:
Sound card -> Loopback application -> ALSA loop device -> arecord

In this case the loopback device should use the sound timer of the sound
card. Without this patch the loopback application has to implement an
adaptive sample rate converter to align the different clocks of the
different ALSA devices.

The used timer can be selected by referring to a sound card, its device
and subdevice, when loading the module:
  $ modprobe snd_aloop enable=1 timer_source=[<card>[.<dev>[.<subdev>]]]
<card> is the name (id) of the sound card or a card number.
<dev> and <subdev> are device and subdevice numbers (defaults are 0).
Empty string as a value of timer_source= parameter enables previous
functionality (using jiffies timer).
