USB: host: ohci-at91: resume: balance the clock start call

There is a clock enable counter run away problem in resume ohci_at91. Code
enables clock that was never disabled in case of non wakeup interface. That
would make clock unstoppable in future.
Use proper alternative to start clocks only if they were stopped before.
