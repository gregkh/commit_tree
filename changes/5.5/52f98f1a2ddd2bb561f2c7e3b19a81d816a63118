NFS/pnfs: Separate NFSv3 DS and MDS traffic

If a NFSv3 server is being used as both a DS and as a regular NFSv3 server,
we may want to keep the IO traffic on a separate TCP connection, since
it will typically have very different timeout characteristics.

This patch therefore sets up a flag to separate the two modes of operation
for the nfs_client.
