crypto: curve25519 - x86_64 library and KPP implementations

This implementation is the fastest available x86_64 implementation, and
unlike Sandy2x, it doesn't requie use of the floating point registers at
all. Instead it makes use of BMI2 and ADX, available on recent
microarchitectures. The implementation was written by Armando
Faz-Hern√°ndez with contributions (upstream) from Samuel Neves and me,
in addition to further changes in the kernel implementation from us.
