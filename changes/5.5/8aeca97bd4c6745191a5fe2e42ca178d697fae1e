arm64: dts: marvell: Add support for Marvell CN9130-DB

Add basic support for the Marvell CN9130 modular development board. It
is based on a CN9130 SoC (one AP807 and one internal CP115), extended
via 2xMoCi interface to possibly add up to two more external CP115
(one located on the main board and the other on the board extension).

Available interfaces:
* AP UART
* AP eMMC
* AP SDHCI (disabled)
* CPO GPIO-0
* CPO GPIO-1
* CP0 CRYPTO-0 (disabled)
* CP0 I2C-0
* CP0 I2C-1
* CP0 SDHCI-0
* CP0 NAND-0
* CP0 SPI-1
* CP0 ETH-0 (SFI with SFP cage not working yet, disabled)
* CP0 ETH-1 (RGMII)
* CP0 ETH-2 (RGMII)
* CP0 SATA-0-1
* CP0 USB3-0 (High-speed only)
* CP0 USB3-1 (High-speed only)
* CP0 PCIe-0 x4
