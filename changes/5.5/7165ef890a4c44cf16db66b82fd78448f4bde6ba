ath10k: Fix HOST capability QMI incompatibility

The introduction of 768ec4c012ac ("ath10k: update HOST capability QMI
message") served the purpose of supporting the new and extended HOST
capability QMI message.

But while the new message adds a slew of optional members it changes the
data type of the "daemon_support" member, which means that older
versions of the firmware will fail to decode the incoming request
message.

There is no way to detect this breakage from Linux and there's no way to
recover from sending the wrong message (i.e. we can't just try one
format and then fallback to the other), so a quirk is introduced in
DeviceTree to indicate to the driver that the firmware requires the 8bit
version of this message.
