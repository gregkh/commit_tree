kselftest: arm64: mangle_pstate_invalid_compat_toggle and common utils

Add some arm64/signal specific boilerplate and utility code to help
further testcases' development.

Introduce also one simple testcase mangle_pstate_invalid_compat_toggle
and some related helpers: it is a simple mangle testcase which messes
with the ucontext_t from within the signal handler, trying to toggle
PSTATE state bits to switch the system between 32bit/64bit execution
state. Expects SIGSEGV on test PASS.
