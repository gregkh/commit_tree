kdb: Tidy up code to handle escape sequences

kdb_read_get_key() has extremely complex break/continue control flow
managed by state variables and is very hard to review or modify. In
particular the way the escape sequence handling interacts with the
general control flow is hard to follow. Separate out the escape key
handling, without changing the control flow. This makes the main body of
the code easier to review.
