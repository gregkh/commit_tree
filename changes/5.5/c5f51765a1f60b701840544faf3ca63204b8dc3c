net: dsa: list DSA links in the fabric

Implement a new list of DSA links in the switch fabric itself, to
provide an alterative to the ds->rtable static arrays.

At the same time, provide a new dsa_routing_port() helper to abstract
the usage of ds->rtable in drivers. If there's no port to reach a
given device, return the first invalid port, ds->num_ports. This avoids
potential signedness errors or the need to define special values.
