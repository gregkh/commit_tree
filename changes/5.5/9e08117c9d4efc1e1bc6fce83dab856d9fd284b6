media: usbvision: Fix races among open, close, and disconnect

Visual inspection of the usbvision driver shows that it suffers from
three races between its open, close, and disconnect handlers.  In
particular, the driver is careful to update its usbvision->user and
usbvision->remove_pending flags while holding the private mutex, but:

	usbvision_v4l2_close() and usbvision_radio_close() don't hold
	the mutex while they check the value of
	usbvision->remove_pending;

	usbvision_disconnect() doesn't hold the mutex while checking
	the value of usbvision->user; and

	also, usbvision_v4l2_open() and usbvision_radio_open() don't
	check whether the device has been unplugged before allowing
	the user to open the device files.

Each of these can potentially lead to usbvision_release() being called
twice and use-after-free errors.

This patch fixes the races by reading the flags while the mutex is
still held and checking for pending removes before allowing an open to
succeed.
