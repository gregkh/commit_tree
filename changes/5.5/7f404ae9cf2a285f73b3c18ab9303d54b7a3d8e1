media: pvrusb2: Fix oops on tear-down when radio support is not present

In some device configurations there's no radio or radio support in the
driver.  That's OK, as the driver sets itself up accordingly.  However
on tear-down in these caes it's still trying to tear down radio
related context when there isn't anything there, leading to
dereferences through a null pointer and chaos follows.

How this bug survived unfixed for 11 years in the pvrusb2 driver is a
mystery to me.
