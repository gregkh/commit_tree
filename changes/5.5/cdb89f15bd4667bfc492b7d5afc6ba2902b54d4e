i40e: allow ethtool to report SW and FW versions in recovery mode

Let ethtool print driver and firmware versions when NIC is in
recovery mode.  Assign i40e_get_drvinfo() operation to ethtool
recovery mode operations.  Previously ethtool did not report
driver and firmware versions when NIC was in recovery mode.
