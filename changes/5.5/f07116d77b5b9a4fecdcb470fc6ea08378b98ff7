mm/vmalloc: respect passed gfp_mask when doing preloading

Allocation functions should comply with the given gfp_mask as much as
possible.  The preallocation code in alloc_vmap_area doesn't follow that
pattern and it is using a hardcoded GFP_KERNEL.  Although this doesn't
really make much difference because vmalloc is not GFP_NOWAIT compliant
in general (e.g.  page table allocations are GFP_KERNEL) there is no
reason to spread that bad habit and it is good to fix the antipattern.
