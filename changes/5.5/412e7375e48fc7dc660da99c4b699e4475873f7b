scsi: lpfc: Complete removal of FCoE T10 PI support on SLI-4 adapters

T10 PI support on SLI-4-based FCoE adapters is not supported.  A prior
commit in the 12.4.0.0 stream added device recognition that would prevent
T10 PI enablement. However, it didn't contain a complete device list. Thus
some SLI-4 FCoE adapters still had T10 PI enabled.

Fix by expanding the device list that identifies FCoE devices.
