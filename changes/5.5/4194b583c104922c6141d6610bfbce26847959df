soc: renesas: Add missing check for non-zero product register address

If the DTB for a device with an RZ/A2 SoC lacks a device node for the
BSID register, the ID validation code falls back to using a register at
address 0x0, which leads to undefined behavior (e.g. reading back a
random value).

This could be fixed by letting fam_rza2.reg point to the actual BSID
register.  However, the hardcoded fallbacks were meant for backwards
compatibility with old DTBs only, not for new SoCs.  Hence fix this by
validating renesas_family.reg before using it.
