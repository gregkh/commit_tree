tools headers uapi: Sync linux/fscrypt.h with the kernel sources

To pick the changes from:

  b103fb7653ff ("fscrypt: add support for IV_INO_LBLK_64 policies")

That don't trigger any changes in tooling.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/linux/fscrypt.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/linux/fscrypt.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/linux/fscrypt.h include/uapi/linux/fscrypt.h
