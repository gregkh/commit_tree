io-wq: add support for bounded vs unbunded work

io_uring supports request types that basically have two different
lifetimes:

1) Bounded completion time. These are requests like disk reads or writes,
   which we know will finish in a finite amount of time.
2) Unbounded completion time. These are generally networked IO, where we
   have no idea how long they will take to complete. Another example is
   POLL commands.

This patch provides support for io-wq to handle these differently, so we
don't starve bounded requests by tying up workers for too long. By default
all work is bounded, unless otherwise specified in the work item.
