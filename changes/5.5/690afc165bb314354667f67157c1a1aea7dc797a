net: ip6_gre: fix moving ip6gre between namespaces

Support for moving IPv4 GRE tunnels between namespaces was added in
commit b57708add314 ("gre: add x-netns support"). The respective change
for IPv6 tunnels, commit 22f08069e8b4 ("ip6gre: add x-netns support")
did not drop NETIF_F_NETNS_LOCAL flag so moving them from one netns to
another is still denied in IPv6 case. Drop NETIF_F_NETNS_LOCAL flag from
ip6gre tunnels to allow moving ip6gre tunnel endpoints between network
namespaces.
