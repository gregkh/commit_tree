s390/qeth: don't set card state in qeth_qdio_clear_card()

Any change to the card state should only be driven by
qeth_l?_set_online() and qeth_l?_stop_card().

qeth_qdio_clear_card() currently also gets called from
(a) qeth_core_shutdown(), where we haven't walked through the whole
    teardown sequence. So changing the state to DOWN is not accurate.
(b) qeth_core_hardsetup_card(), which is only called while the card is
    still in DOWN state. No change in behaviour here.
