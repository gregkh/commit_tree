bpf: Replace prog_raw_tp+btf_id with prog_tracing

The bpf program type raw_tp together with 'expected_attach_type'
was the most appropriate api to indicate BTF-enabled raw_tp programs.
But during development it became apparent that 'expected_attach_type'
cannot be used and new 'attach_btf_id' field had to be introduced.
Which means that the information is duplicated in two fields where
one of them is ignored.
Clean it up by introducing new program type where both
'expected_attach_type' and 'attach_btf_id' fields have
specific meaning.
In the future 'expected_attach_type' will be extended
with other attach points that have similar semantics to raw_tp.
This patch is replacing BTF-enabled BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT with
prog_type = BPF_RPOG_TYPE_TRACING
expected_attach_type = BPF_TRACE_RAW_TP
attach_btf_id = btf_id of raw tracepoint inside the kernel
Future patches will add
expected_attach_type = BPF_TRACE_FENTRY or BPF_TRACE_FEXIT
where programs have the same input context and the same helpers,
but different attach points.
