bcache: fix a lost wake-up problem caused by mca_cannibalize_lock

This patch fix a lost wake-up problem caused by the race between
mca_cannibalize_lock and bch_cannibalize_unlock.

Consider two processes, A and B. Process A is executing
mca_cannibalize_lock, while process B takes c->btree_cache_alloc_lock
and is executing bch_cannibalize_unlock. The problem happens that after
process A executes cmpxchg and will execute prepare_to_wait. In this
timeslice process B executes wake_up, but after that process A executes
prepare_to_wait and set the state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. Then process A
goes to sleep but no one will wake up it. This problem may cause bcache
device to dead.
