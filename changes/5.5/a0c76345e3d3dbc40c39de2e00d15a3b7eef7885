devlink: disallow reload operation during device cleanup

There is a race between driver code that does setup/cleanup of device
and devlink reload operation that in some drivers works with the same
code. Use after free could we easily obtained by running:

while true; do
        echo 10 > /sys/bus/netdevsim/new_device
        devlink dev reload netdevsim/netdevsim10 &
        echo 10 > /sys/bus/netdevsim/del_device
done

Fix this by enabling reload only after setup of device is complete and
disabling it at the beginning of the cleanup process.
