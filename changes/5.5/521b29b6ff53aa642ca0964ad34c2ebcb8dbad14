kconfig: split util.c out of parser.y

util.c exists both in scripts/kconfig/ and scripts/kconfig/lxdialog.

Prior to commit 54b8ae66ae1a ("kbuild: change *FLAGS_<basetarget>.o
to take the path relative to $(obj)"), Kbuild could not pass different
flags to source files with the same basename. Now that this issue
was solved, you can split util.c out of parser.y and compile them
independently of each other.
