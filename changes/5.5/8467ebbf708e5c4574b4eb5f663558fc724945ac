arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: olinuxino: Fix eMMC supply regulator

A64-OLinuXino-eMMC uses 1.8V for eMMC supply. This is done via a triple
jumper, which sets VCC-PL to either 1.8V or 3.3V. This setting is different
for boards with and without eMMC.

This is not a big issue for DDR52 mode, however the eMMC will not work in
HS200/HS400, since these modes explicitly requires 1.8V.
