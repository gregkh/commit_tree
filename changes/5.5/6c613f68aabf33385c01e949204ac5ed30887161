spi: core,atmel: convert `word_delay_usecs` -> `word_delay` for spi_device

This change does a conversion from the `word_delay_usecs` -> `word_delay`
for the `spi_device` struct.

This allows users to specify inter-word delays in other unit types
(nano-seconds or clock cycles), depending on how users want.

The Atmel SPI driver is the only current user of the `word_delay_usecs`
field (from the `spi_device` struct).
So, it needed a slight conversion to use the `word_delay` as an `spi_delay`
struct.

In SPI core, the only required mechanism is to update the `word_delay`
information per `spi_transfer`. This requires a bit more logic than before,
because it needs that both delays be converted to a common unit
(nano-seconds) for comparison.
