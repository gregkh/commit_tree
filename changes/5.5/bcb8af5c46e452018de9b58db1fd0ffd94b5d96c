perf maps: Purge the entries from maps->names in __maps__purge()

No need to iterate via the ->names rbtree, as all the entries there
as in maps->entries as well, reuse __maps__purge() for that.

Doing it this way we can kill maps__for_each_entry_by_name(),
maps__for_each_entry_by_name_safe(), maps__{first,next}_by_name().
