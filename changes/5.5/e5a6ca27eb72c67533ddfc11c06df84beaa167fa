drm/dp_mst: Correct the bug in drm_dp_update_payload_part1()

[Why]
If the payload_state is DP_PAYLOAD_DELETE_LOCAL in series, current
code doesn't delete the payload at current index and just move the
index to next one after shuffling payloads.

[How]
Drop the i++ increasing part in for loop head and decide whether
to increase the index or not according to payload_state of current
payload.

Changes since v1:
* Refine the code to have it easy reading
* Amend the commit message to meet the way code is modified now.
