compat_ioctl: unify copy-in of ppp filters

Now that isdn4linux is gone, the is only one implementation of PPPIOCSPASS
and PPPIOCSACTIVE in ppp_generic.c, so this is where the compat_ioctl
support should be implemented.

The two commands are implemented in very similar ways, so introduce
new helpers to allow sharing between the two and between native and
compat mode.
