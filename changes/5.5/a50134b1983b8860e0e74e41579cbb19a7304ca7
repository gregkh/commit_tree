drm/i915: Make for_each_engine_masked work on intel_gt

Medium term goal is to eliminate the i915->engine[] array and to get there
we have recently introduced equivalent array in intel_gt. Now we need to
migrate the code further towards this state.

This next step is to eliminate usage of i915->engines[] from the
for_each_engine_masked iterator.

For this to work we also need to use engine->id as index when populating
the gt->engine[] array and adjust the default engine set indexing to use
engine->legacy_idx instead of assuming gt->engines[] indexing.

v2:
  * Populate gt->engine[] earlier.
  * Check that we don't duplicate engine->legacy_idx

v3:
  * Work around the initialization order issue between default_engines()
    and intel_engines_driver_register() which sets engine->legacy_idx for
    now. It will be fixed properly later.

v4:
  * Merge with forgotten v2.5.
