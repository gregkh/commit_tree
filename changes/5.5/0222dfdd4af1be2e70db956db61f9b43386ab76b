btrfs: rename extent buffer block group item accessors

Accessors defined by BTRFS_SETGET_FUNCS take a raw extent buffer and
manipulate the items there, there's no special prefix required. The
block group accessors had _disk_ because previously the names were
occupied by the on-stack accessors. As this has been addressed in the
previous patch, we can now unify the naming.
