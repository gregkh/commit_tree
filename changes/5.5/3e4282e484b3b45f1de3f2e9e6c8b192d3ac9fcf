powerpc/85xx: remove mostly pointless mpc85xx_qe_init()

Since commit 302c059f2e7b (QE: use subsys_initcall to init qe),
mpc85xx_qe_init() has done nothing apart from possibly emitting a
pr_err(). As part of reducing the amount of QE-related code in
arch/powerpc/ (and eventually support QE on other architectures),
remove this low-hanging fruit.
