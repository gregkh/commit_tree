PCI/ATS: Handle sharing of PF PASID Capability with all VFs

Per PCIe r5.0, sec 9.3.7.14, if a PF implements the PASID Capability, the
PF PASID configuration is shared by its VFs.  VFs must not implement their
own PASID Capability.  Since VFs don't have a PASID Capability,
pci_enable_pasid() always failed, which caused IOMMU setup to fail.

Update the PASID interfaces so for VFs they reflect the state of the PF
PASID.
