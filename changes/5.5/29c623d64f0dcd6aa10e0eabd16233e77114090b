ARM: 8939/1: kbuild: use correct nm executable

Since $(NM) variable can be easily overridden for the whole build, it's
better to use it instead of $(CROSS_COMPILE)nm. The use of $(CROSS_COMPILE)
prefixed variables where their calculated equivalents can be used is
incorrect. This fixes issues with builds where $(NM) is set to llvm-nm.
