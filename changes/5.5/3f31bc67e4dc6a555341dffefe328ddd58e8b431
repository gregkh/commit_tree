mfd: intel-lpss: Add default I2C device properties for Gemini Lake

It turned out Intel Gemini Lake doesn't use the same I2C timing
parameters as Broxton.

I got confirmation from the Windows team that Gemini Lake systems should
use updated timing parameters that differ from those used in Broxton
based systems.
