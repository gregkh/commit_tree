net: caif: Fix debugfs on 64-bit platforms

"ser_device.state" is "unsigned long", i.e. 32-bit or 64-bit, depending
on the platform.  Hence casting its address to "u32 *", and calling
debugfs_create_x32() breaks operation on 64-bit platforms.

Fix this by using the new debugfs_create_xul() helper instead.
