drm/amd/display: Make clk mgr the only dto update point

[Why]

* Clk Mgr DTO update point did not cover all needed updates, as it included a
  check for plane_state which does not exist yet when the updater is called on
  driver startup
* This resulted in another update path in the pipe programming sequence, based
  on a dppclk update flag
* However, this alternate path allowed for stray DTO updates, some of which would
  occur in the wrong order during dppclk lowering and cause underflow

[How]

* Remove plane_state check and use of plane_res.dpp->inst, getting rid
  of sequence dependencies (this results in extra dto programming for unused
  pipes but that doesn't cause issues and is a small cost)
* Allow DTOs to be updated even if global clock is equal, to account for
  edge case exposed by diags tests
* Remove update_dpp_dto call in pipe programming sequence (leave update to
  dppclk_control there, as that update is necessary and shouldn't occur in clk
  mgr)
* Remove call to optimize_bandwidth when committing state, as it is not needed
  and resulted in sporadic underflows even with other fixes in place
