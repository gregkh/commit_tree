tpm: fix invalid locking in NONBLOCKING mode

When an application sends TPM commands in NONBLOCKING mode
the driver holds chip->tpm_mutex returning from write(),
which triggers: "WARNING: lock held when returning to user space".
To fix this issue the driver needs to release the mutex before
returning and acquire it again in tpm_dev_async_work() before
sending the command.
