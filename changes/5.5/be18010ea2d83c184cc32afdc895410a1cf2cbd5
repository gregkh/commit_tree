tools, bpf: Rename pr_warning to pr_warn to align with kernel logging

For kernel logging macros, pr_warning() is completely removed and
replaced by pr_warn(). By using pr_warn() in tools/lib/bpf/ for
symmetry to kernel logging macros, we could eventually drop the
use of pr_warning() in the whole kernel tree.
