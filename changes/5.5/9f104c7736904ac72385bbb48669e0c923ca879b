mqprio: Fix out-of-bounds access in mqprio_dump

When user runs a command like
tc qdisc add dev eth1 root mqprio
KASAN stack-out-of-bounds warning is emitted.
Currently, NLA_ALIGN macro used in mqprio_dump provides too large
buffer size as argument for nla_put and memcpy down the call stack.
The flow looks like this:
1. nla_put expects exact object size as an argument;
2. Later it provides this size to memcpy;
3. To calculate correct padding for SKB, nla_put applies NLA_ALIGN
   macro itself.

Therefore, NLA_ALIGN should not be applied to the nla_put parameter.
Otherwise it will lead to out-of-bounds memory access in memcpy.
