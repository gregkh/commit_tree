drm/i915/gem: Refine occupancy test in kill_context()

Don't just look at the very last request in a queue when deciding if we
need to evict the context from the GPU, as that request may still be in
the submission queue while the rest of the context is running!

Instead, walk back along the queued requests looking for the active
request and checking that.

Testcase: igt/gem_ctx_persistence/queued
