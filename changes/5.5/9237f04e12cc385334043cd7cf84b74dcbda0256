scsi: core: Fix scsi_get/set_resid() interface

struct scsi_cmnd cmd->req.resid_len which is returned and set respectively
by the helper functions scsi_get_resid() and scsi_set_resid() is an
unsigned int. Reflect this fact in the interface of these helper functions.

Also fix compilation errors due to min() and max() type mismatch introduced
by this change in scsi debug code, usb transport code and in the USB ENE
card reader driver.
