rtc: msm6242: Remove unneeded msm6242_set()/msm6242_clear() functions

The msm6242_set()/msm6242_clear() functions are used when writing to Control
Register D to set or clear the HOLD bit when reading the current time from
the RTC.

Doing this with a read-modify-write cycle will potentially clear an
interrupt condition which occurs between the read and the write.

The datasheet states the following about this:

  When writing the HOLD or 30 second adjust bits of register D, it is
  necessary to write the IRQ FLAG bit to a "1".

Since the only other bits in the register are the 30 second adjust bit
(which is not used) and the BUSY bit (which is read-only), the
read-modify-write cycle can be replaced by a simple write with the IRQ FLAG
bit set to 1 and the other bits (except HOLD) set to 0.
