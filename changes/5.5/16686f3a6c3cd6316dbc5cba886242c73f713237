nvme: move common call to nvme_cleanup_cmd to core layer

nvme_cleanup_cmd should be called for each call to nvme_setup_cmd
(symmetrical functions). Move the call for nvme_cleanup_cmd to the common
core layer and call it during nvme_complete_rq for the good flow. For
error flow, each transport will call nvme_cleanup_cmd independently. Also
take care of a special case of path failure, where we call
nvme_complete_rq without doing nvme_setup_cmd.
