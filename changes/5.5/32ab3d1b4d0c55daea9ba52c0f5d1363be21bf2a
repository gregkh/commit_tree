btrfs: remove pointless indentation in btrfs_read_sys_array()

Instead of checking if we've read a BTRFS_CHUNK_ITEM_KEY from disk and
then process it we could just bail out early if the read disk key wasn't
a BTRFS_CHUNK_ITEM_KEY.

This removes a level of indentation and makes the code nicer to read.
