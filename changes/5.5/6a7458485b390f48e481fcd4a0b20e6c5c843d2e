KVM: arm64: Document PV-time interface

Introduce a paravirtualization interface for KVM/arm64 based on the
"Arm Paravirtualized Time for Arm-Base Systems" specification DEN 0057A.

This only adds the details about "Stolen Time" as the details of "Live
Physical Time" have not been fully agreed.

User space can specify a reserved area of memory for the guest and
inform KVM to populate the memory with information on time that the host
kernel has stolen from the guest.

A hypercall interface is provided for the guest to interrogate the
hypervisor's support for this interface and the location of the shared
memory structures.
