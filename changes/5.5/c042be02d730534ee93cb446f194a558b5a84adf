MIPS: bitops: Use BIT_WORD() & BITS_PER_LONG

Rather than using custom SZLONG_LOG & SZLONG_MASK macros to shift & mask
a bit index to form word & bit offsets respectively, make use of the
standard BIT_WORD() & BITS_PER_LONG macros for the same purpose.

volatile is added to the definition of pointers to the long-sized word
we'll operate on, in order to prevent the compiler complaining that we
cast away the volatile qualifier of the addr argument. This should have
no effect on generated code, which in the LL/SC case is inline asm
anyway & in the non-LLSC case access is constrained by compiler barriers
provided by raw_local_irq_{save,restore}().
