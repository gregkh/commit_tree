pwm: sun4i: Fix incorrect calculation of duty_cycle/period

Since 5.4-rc1, pwm_apply_state calls ->get_state after ->apply
if available, and this revealed an issue with integer precision
when calculating duty_cycle and period for the currently set
state in ->get_state callback.

This issue manifested in broken backlight on several Allwinner
based devices.

Previously this worked, because ->apply updated the passed state
directly.
