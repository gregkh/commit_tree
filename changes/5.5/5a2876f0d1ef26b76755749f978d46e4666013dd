scsi: zfcp: introduce sysfs interface to read the local B2B-Credit

In addition to the diagnostic data from the local SFP transceiver this
patch adds an interface to read the advertised buffer-to-buffer credit from
the local FC_Port.

With this patch the userspace-interface will only read data stored in the
corresponding "diagnostic buffer" (that was stored during completion of a
previous Exchange Config Data command). Implicit updating will follow later
in this series.
