cifs: Fix potential softlockups while refreshing DFS cache

We used to skip reconnects on all SMB2_IOCTL commands due to SMB3+
FSCTL_VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO - which made sense since we're still
establishing a SMB session.

However, when refresh_cache_worker() calls smb2_get_dfs_refer() and
we're under reconnect, SMB2_ioctl() will not be able to get a proper
status error (e.g. -EHOSTDOWN in case we failed to reconnect) but an
-EAGAIN from cifs_send_recv() thus looping forever in
refresh_cache_worker().

Fixes: e99c63e4d86d ("SMB3: Fix deadlock in validate negotiate hits reconnect")
