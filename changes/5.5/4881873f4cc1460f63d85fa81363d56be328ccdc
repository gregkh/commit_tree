dt-bindings: reset: meson8b: fix duplicate reset IDs

According to the public S805 datasheet the RESET2 register uses the
following bits for the PIC_DC, PSC and NAND reset lines:
- PIC_DC is at bit 3 (meaning: RESET_VD_RMEM + 3)
- PSC is at bit 4 (meaning: RESET_VD_RMEM + 4)
- NAND is at bit 5 (meaning: RESET_VD_RMEM + 4)

Update the reset IDs of these three reset lines so they don't conflict
with PIC_DC and map to the actual hardware reset lines.
