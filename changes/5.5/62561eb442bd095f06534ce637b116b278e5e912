libbpf: Add support for field existance CO-RE relocation

Add support for BPF_FRK_EXISTS relocation kind to detect existence of
captured field in a destination BTF, allowing conditional logic to
handle incompatible differences between kernels.

Also introduce opt-in relaxed CO-RE relocation handling option, which
makes libbpf emit warning for failed relocations, but proceed with other
relocations. Instruction, for which relocation failed, is patched with
(u32)-1 value.
