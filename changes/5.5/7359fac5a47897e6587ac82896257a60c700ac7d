media: i2c: ov2659: Fix for image wrap-around in lower resolution

Based on recently found sensor configuration examples, it was
discovered that when scaling and binning are used for the lower
resolutions (i.e. 640x480, 320x240) the read offset has to be
increased otherwise the image appears to be wrapped around.
