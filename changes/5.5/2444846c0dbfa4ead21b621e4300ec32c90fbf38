media: ti-vpe: vpe: fix a v4l2-compliance failure about frame sequence number

v4l2-compliance fails with this message:

   fail: v4l2-test-buffers.cpp(294): \
	(int)g_sequence() < seq.last_seq + 1
   fail: v4l2-test-buffers.cpp(740): \
	buf.check(m2m_q, last_m2m_seq)
   fail: v4l2-test-buffers.cpp(974): \
	captureBufs(node, q, m2m_q, frame_count, true)
   test MMAP: FAIL

The driver is failing to update the source frame sequence number in the
vb2 buffer object. Only the destination frame sequence was being
updated.

This is only a reporting issue if the user space app actually cares
about the frame sequence number. But it is fixed nonetheless.
