bus: hisi_lpc: Expand build test coverage

Currently the driver will only ever be built for ARM64 because it selects
CONFIG_INDIRECT_PIO, which itself depends on ARM64.

Expand build test coverage for the driver to other architectures by only
selecting CONFIG_INDIRECT_PIO for ARM64, when we really want it.

We don't include ALPHA, C6X, HEXAGON, and PARISC architectures as they
don't define {read, write}sb.
