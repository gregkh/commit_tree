efi/memreserve: Register reservations as 'reserved' in /proc/iomem

Memory regions that are reserved using efi_mem_reserve_persistent()
are recorded in a special EFI config table which survives kexec,
allowing the incoming kernel to honour them as well. However,
such reservations are not visible in /proc/iomem, and so the kexec
tools that load the incoming kernel and its initrd into memory may
overwrite these reserved regions before the incoming kernel has a
chance to reserve them from further use.

Address this problem by adding these reservations to /proc/iomem as
they are created. Note that reservations that are inherited from a
previous kernel are memblock_reserve()'d early on, so they are already
visible in /proc/iomem.
