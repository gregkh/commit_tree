drm/radeon: Correct Transmit Margin masks

Previously we masked PCIe Link Control 2 register values with "7 << 9",
which was apparently intended to be the Transmit Margin field, but instead
was the high order bit of Transmit Margin, the Enter Modified Compliance
bit, and the Compliance SOS bit.

Correct the mask to "7 << 7", which is the Transmit Margin field.
