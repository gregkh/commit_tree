perf trace: Allocate an array of beautifiers for tracepoint args

This will work similar to the syscall args, we'll allocate an array
of 'struct syscall_arg_fmt' for the tracepoint args and then init them
using the same algorithm used for the defaults for syscall args, i.e.
using its types and sometimes names as hints to find the right scnprintf
routine to beautify them from numbers into strings.

Next step is to stop using libtracevent to printf tracepoints, as we'll
have more beautifiers than int provides, modulo perhaps some plugins.
