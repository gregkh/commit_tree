drm/omap: fix dma_addr refcounting

cec4fa7511ef7a73eb635834e9d85b25a5b47a98 ("drm/omap: use refcount API to
track the number of users of dma_addr") changed omap_gem.c to use
refcounting API to track dma_addr uses.  However, the driver only tracks
the refcounts for non-contiguous buffers, and the patch didn't fully
take this in account.

After the patch, the driver always decreased refcount in omap_gem_unpin,
instead of decreasing the refcount only for non-contiguous buffers. This
leads to refcounting mismatch.

As for the contiguous cases the refcount is never increased, fix this
issue by returning from omap_gem_unpin if the buffer being unpinned is
contiguous.
