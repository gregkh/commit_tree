drm/amd/display: add more checks to validate seamless boot timing

[why]
we found using an active DP to HDMI panel that we weren't validating
dp_pixel_format and hardware timing v_front_porch, causing screen to
blank and/or corrupt while attempting a seamless boot.

[how]
added checks during dc_validate_seamless_boot_timing for these values
