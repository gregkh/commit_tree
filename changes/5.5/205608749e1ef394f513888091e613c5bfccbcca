Revert "iwlwifi: mvm: fix scan config command size"

Since v5.4-rc1 was released, iwlwifi started throwing errors when scan
commands were sent to the firmware with certain devices (depending on
the OTP burned in the device, which contains the list of available
channels).  For instance:

iwlwifi 0000:00:14.3: FW error in SYNC CMD SCAN_CFG_CMD

This bug was reported in the ArchLinux bug tracker:
https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64703

And also in a specific case in bugzilla, when the lar_disabled option
was set: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205193

Revert the commit that introduced this error, by using the number of
channels from the OTP instead of the number of channels that is
specified in the FW TLV that tells us how many channels it supports.

This reverts commit 06eb547c4ae4382e70d556ba213d13c95ca1801b.
