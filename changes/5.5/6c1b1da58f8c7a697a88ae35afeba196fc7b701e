block: add zone open, close and finish operations

Zoned block devices (ZBC and ZAC devices) allow an explicit control
over the condition (state) of zones. The operations allowed are:
* Open a zone: Transition to open condition to indicate that a zone will
  actively be written
* Close a zone: Transition to closed condition to release the drive
  resources used for writing to a zone
* Finish a zone: Transition an open or closed zone to the full
  condition to prevent write operations

To enable this control for in-kernel zoned block device users, define
the new request operations REQ_OP_ZONE_OPEN, REQ_OP_ZONE_CLOSE
and REQ_OP_ZONE_FINISH as well as the generic function
blkdev_zone_mgmt() for submitting these operations on a range of zones.
This results in blkdev_reset_zones() removal and replacement with this
new zone magement function. Users of blkdev_reset_zones() (f2fs and
dm-zoned) are updated accordingly.
