Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst: document why inactive_X + active_X may not equal X

This has confused a significant number of people using cgroups inside
Facebook, and some of those outside as well judging by posts like
this[0] (although it's not a problem unique to cgroup v2).

If shmem handling in particular becomes more coherent at some point in
the future -- although that seems unlikely now -- we can change the
wording here.
