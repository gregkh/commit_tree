KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Implement LPCR[AIL]=3 mode for injected interrupts

kvmppc_inject_interrupt does not implement LPCR[AIL]!=0 modes, which
can result in the guest receiving interrupts as if LPCR[AIL]=0
contrary to the ISA.

In practice, Linux guests cope with this deviation, but it should be
fixed.
