serial: sprd: Add clearing break interrupt operation

A break interrupt will be generated if the RX line was pulled low, which
means some abnomal behaviors occurred of the UART. In this case, we still
need to clear this break interrupt status, otherwise it will cause irq
storm to crash the whole system.
