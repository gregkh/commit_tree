x86/jailhouse: Only enable platform UARTs if available

ACPI tables aren't available if Linux runs as guest of the hypervisor
Jailhouse. This makes the 8250 driver probe for all platform UARTs as it
assumes that all UARTs are present in case of !ACPI. Jailhouse will stop
execution of Linux guest due to port access violation.

So far, these access violations were solved by tuning the 8250.nr_uarts
cmdline parameter, but this has limitations: Only consecutive platform
UARTs can be mapped to Linux, and only in the sequence 0x3f8, 0x2f8,
0x3e8, 0x2e8.

Beginning from setup_data version 2, Jailhouse will place information of
available platform UARTs in setup_data. This allows for selective
activation of platform UARTs.

Query setup_data version and only activate available UARTS. This
patch comes with backward compatibility, and will still support older
setup_data versions. In case of older setup_data versions, Linux falls
back to the old behaviour.
