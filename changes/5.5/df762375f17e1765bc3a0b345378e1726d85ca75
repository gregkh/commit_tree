habanalabs: Mark queue as expecting CB handle or address

Jobs on some queues must be provided with a handle to a driver command
buffer object, while for other queues, jobs must be provided with an
address to a command buffer.
Currently the distinction is done based on the queue type, which is less
flexible if the same queue type behaves differently on different
types of ASICs.
This patch adds a new queue property for this target, which is
configured per queue type per ASIC type.
