cfg80211: fix double-free after changing network namespace

If wdev->wext.keys was initialized it didn't get reset to NULL on
unregister (and it doesn't get set in cfg80211_init_wdev either), but
wdev is reused if unregister was triggered through
cfg80211_switch_netns.

The next unregister (for whatever reason) will try to free
wdev->wext.keys again.
