drm/panfrost: Fix a race in panfrost_ioctl_madvise()

If 2 threads change the MADVISE property of the same BO in parallel we
might end up with an shmem->madv value that's inconsistent with the
presence of the BO in the shrinker list.

The easiest solution to fix that is to protect the
drm_gem_shmem_madvise() call with the shrinker lock.
