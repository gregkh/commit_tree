docs: Use make invocation's -j argument for parallelism

While sphinx 1.7 and later supports "-jauto" for parallelism, this
effectively ignores the "-j" flag used in the "make" invocation, which
may cause confusion for build systems. Instead, extract the available
parallelism from "make"'s job server (since it is not exposed in any
special variables) and use that for the "sphinx-build" run. Now things
work correctly for builds where -j is specified at the top-level:

	make -j16 htmldocs

If -j is not specified, continue to fallback to "-jauto" if available.
