net: of_get_phy_mode: Change API to solve int/unit warnings

Before this change of_get_phy_mode() returned an enum,
phy_interface_t. On error, -ENODEV etc, is returned. If the result of
the function is stored in a variable of type phy_interface_t, and the
compiler has decided to represent this as an unsigned int, comparision
with -ENODEV etc, is a signed vs unsigned comparision.

Fix this problem by changing the API. Make the function return an
error, or 0 on success, and pass a pointer, of type phy_interface_t,
where the phy mode should be stored.

v2:
Return with *interface set to PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_NA on error.
Add error checks to all users of of_get_phy_mode()
Fixup a few reverse christmas tree errors
Fixup a few slightly malformed reverse christmas trees

v3:
Fix 0-day reported errors.
