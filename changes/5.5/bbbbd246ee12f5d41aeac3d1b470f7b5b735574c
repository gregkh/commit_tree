clk: rockchip: make clk_half_divider_ops static

The clk_half_divider_ops is not used outside or declared
outside of drivers/clk/rockchip/clk-half-divider.c so make
it static to avoid the following warning:

drivers/clk/rockchip/clk-half-divider.c:142:22: warning: symbol 'clk_half_divider_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
