clk: mvebu: armada-37xx-periph: change suspend/resume time

Armada 3700 PCIe IP relies on the PCIe clock managed by this
driver. For reasons related to the PCI core's organization when
suspending/resuming, PCI host controller drivers must reconfigure
their registers at suspend_noirq()/resume_noirq() which happens after
suspend()/suspend_late() and before resume_early()/resume().

Device link support in the clock framework enforce that the clock
driver's resume() callback will be called before the PCIe
driver's. But, any resume_noirq() callback will be called before all
the registered resume() callbacks.

The solution to support PCIe resume operation is to change the
"priority" of this clock driver PM callbacks to "_noirq()".
