can: m_can: add support for one shot mode

According to the CAN Specification (see ISO 11898-1:2015, 8.3.4
Recovery Management), the M_CAN provides means for automatic
retransmission of frames that have lost arbitration or that
have been disturbed by errors during transmission. By default
automatic retransmission is enabled.

The Bosch MCAN controller has support for disabling automatic
retransmission.

To support time-triggered communication as described in ISO
11898-1:2015, chapter 9.2, the automatic retransmission may be
disabled via CCCR.DAR.

CAN_CTRLMODE_ONE_SHOT is used for disabling automatic retransmission.
