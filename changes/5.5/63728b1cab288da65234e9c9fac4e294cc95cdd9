media: ti-vpe: vpdma: Use fixed type for address in descriptor

Using dma_addr_t as the type to hold address inside of a fix sized
descriptor used by the vpdma firmware is prone to fail when the expected
width is 32 bits and suddenly when CONFIG_LPAE is enabled the data size
is now 64 bits shifted the remaining members of the descriptor in memory
which confuses the firmware.
