drm/connector: Share with non-atomic drivers the function to get the single encoder

This 3 non-atomic drivers all have the same function getting the
only encoder available in the connector, also atomic drivers have
this fallback. So moving it a common place and sharing between atomic
and non-atomic drivers.

While at it I also removed the mention of
drm_atomic_helper_best_encoder() that was renamed in
commit 297e30b5d9b6 ("drm/atomic-helper: Unexport
drm_atomic_helper_best_encoder").

v3: moving drm_connector_get_single_encoder to drm_kms_helper module
