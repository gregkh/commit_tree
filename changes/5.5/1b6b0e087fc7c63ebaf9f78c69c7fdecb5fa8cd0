coresight: etm4x: Fix issues with start-stop logic.

Fixes the following issues when using the ETMv4 start-stop logic.

1) Setting a start or a stop address should not automatically set the
start-stop status to 'on'. The value set by the user in 'mode' must
be respected or start instances could be missed.
2) Missing API for controlling TRCVIPCSSCTLR - start stop control by
PE comparators.
3) Default ETM configuration sets a trace all range, and correctly sets
the start-stop status bit. This was not being correctly reflected in
the 'mode' parameter.
