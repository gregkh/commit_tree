hugetlbfs: add O_TMPFILE support

With hugetlbfs, a common pattern for mapping anonymous huge pages is to
create a temporary file first.  Currently libraries like libhugetlbfs
and seastar create these with a standard mkstemp+unlink trick, but it
would be more robust to be able to simply pass the O_TMPFILE flag to
open().  O_TMPFILE is already supported by several file systems like
ext4 and xfs.  The implementation simply uses the existi= ng d_tmpfile
utility function to instantiate the dcache entry for the file.

Tested manually by successfully creating a temporary file by opening it
with (O_TMPFILE|O_RDWR) on mounted hugetlbfs and successfully mapping 2M
huge pages with it.  Without the patch, trying to open a file with
O_TMPFILE results in -ENOSUP.
