Input: keyspan-remote - fix control-message timeouts

The driver was issuing synchronous uninterruptible control requests
without using a timeout. This could lead to the driver hanging on probe
due to a malfunctioning (or malicious) device until the device is
physically disconnected. While sleeping in probe the driver prevents
other devices connected to the same hub from being added to (or removed
from) the bus.

The USB upper limit of five seconds per request should be more than
enough.
