bpftool: Fix printing incorrect pointer in btf_dump_ptr

For plain text output, it incorrectly prints the pointer value
"void *data".  The "void *data" is actually pointing to memory that
contains a bpf-map's value.  The intention is to print the content of
the bpf-map's value instead of printing the pointer pointing to the
bpf-map's value.

In this case, a member of the bpf-map's value is a pointer type.
Thus, it should print the "*(void **)data".
