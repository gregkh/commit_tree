drm/i915/perf: Wean ourselves off dev_priv

Use the local uncore accessors for the GT rather than using the [not-so]
magic global dev_priv mmio routines. In the process, we also teach the
perf stream to use backpointers to the i915_perf rather than digging it
out of dev_priv.

v2: Rebase onto i915_perf_types.h
