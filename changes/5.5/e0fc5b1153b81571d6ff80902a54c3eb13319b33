SMB3: Fix crash in SMB2_open_init due to uninitialized field in compounding path

Ran into an intermittent crash in
	SMB2_open_init+0x2f6/0x970
due to oparms.cifs_sb not being initialized when called from:
	smb2_compound_op+0x45d/0x1690
Zero the whole oparms struct in the compounding path before setting up the
oparms so we don't risk any uninitialized fields.

Fixes: fdef665ba44a ("smb3: fix mode passed in on create for modetosid mount option")
