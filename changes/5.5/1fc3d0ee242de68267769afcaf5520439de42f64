tools headers kvm: Sync kvm headers with the kernel sources

To pick up the changes from:

  14edff88315a Merge tag 'kvmarm-5.5' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into HEAD
  a4b28f5c6798 Merge remote-tracking branch 'kvmarm/kvm-arm64/stolen-time' into kvmarm-master/next
  58772e9a3db7 ("KVM: arm64: Provide VCPU attributes for stolen time")
  da345174ceca ("KVM: arm/arm64: Allow user injection of external data aborts")
  c726200dd106 ("KVM: arm/arm64: Allow reporting non-ISV data aborts to userspace")
  efe5ddcae496 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Allow userspace to set the # of VPs")

No tools changes are caused by this, as the only defines so far used
from these files are for syscall arg pretty printing are:

  $ grep KVM tools/perf/trace/beauty/*.sh
  tools/perf/trace/beauty/kvm_ioctl.sh:regex='^#[[:space:]]*define[[:space:]]+KVM_(\w+)[[:space:]]+_IO[RW]*\([[:space:]]*KVMIO[[:space:]]*,[[:space:]]*(0x[[:xdigit:]]+).*'
  $

Some are also include by:

  tools/perf/arch/x86/util/kvm-stat.c
  tools/perf/arch/powerpc/util/kvm-stat.c

This addresses these tools/perf build warnings:
