mm/page_isolation.c: convert SKIP_HWPOISON to MEMORY_OFFLINE

We have two types of users of page isolation:

 1. Memory offlining:  Offline memory so it can be unplugged. Memory
                       won't be touched.

 2. Memory allocation: Allocate memory (e.g., alloc_contig_range()) to
                       become the owner of the memory and make use of
                       it.

For example, in case we want to offline memory, we can ignore (skip
over) PageHWPoison() pages, as the memory won't get used.  We can allow
to offline memory.  In contrast, we don't want to allow to allocate such
memory.

Let's generalize the approach so we can special case other types of
pages we want to skip over in case we offline memory.  While at it, also
pass the same flags to test_pages_isolated().
