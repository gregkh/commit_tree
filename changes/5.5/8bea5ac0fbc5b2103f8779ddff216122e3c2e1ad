clk: mmp2: Fix the order of timer mux parents

Determined empirically, no documentation is available.

The OLPC XO-1.75 laptop used parent 1, that one being VCTCXO/4 (65MHz), but
thought it's a VCTCXO/2 (130MHz). The mmp2 timer driver, not knowing
what is going on, ended up just dividing the rate as of
commit f36797ee4380 ("ARM: mmp/mmp2: dt: enable the clock")'
