media: dvb-usb-v2/gl861: remove device-specific i2c algo

For Friio dvb cards, a distinct I2C algo was provided to support
some "long" I2C messages used in relaying tuner I2C via demod.
Since the other (generic) i2c algo in this module has been patched
to support those messages in a more generic way,
this patch replaces and integrates the device-specific i2c algo
with the generic one and simplifies the code.
