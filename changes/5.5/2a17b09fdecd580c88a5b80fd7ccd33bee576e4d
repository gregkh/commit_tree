staging: exfat: Remove FAT/VFAT mount support, part 3

In this patch, we straighten out most of the cases where the
code was testing 'p_fs->vol_type == EXFAT' and '!= EXFAT'

There's still some ?: ops and a few places where the code
is doing checks for '.' and '..' that require looking at,
but those are future patches
