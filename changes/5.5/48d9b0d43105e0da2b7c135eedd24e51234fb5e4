block: account statistics for passthrough requests

Presently, passthrough requests are not accounted for because
blk_do_io_stat() expressly rejects them. Based on some digging
in the history, this doesn't seem like a concious decision but
one that evolved from the change from blk_fs_request() to
blk_rq_is_passthrough().

To support this, call blk_account_io_start() in blk_execute_rq_nowait()
and remove the passthrough check in blk_do_io_stat().
