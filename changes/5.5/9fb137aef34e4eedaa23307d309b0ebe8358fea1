net: usb: ax88179_178a: allow optionally getting mac address from device tree

Adopt and integrate the feature to pass the MAC address via device tree
from asix_device.c (03fc5d4) also to other ax88179 based asix chips.
E.g. the bootloader fills in local-mac-address and the driver will then
pick up and use this MAC address.
