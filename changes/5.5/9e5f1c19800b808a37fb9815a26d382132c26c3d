pstore/ram: Write new dumps to start of recycled zones

The ram_core.c routines treat przs as circular buffers. When writing a
new crash dump, the old buffer needs to be cleared so that the new dump
doesn't end up in the wrong place (i.e. at the end).

The solution to this problem is to reset the circular buffer state before
writing a new Oops dump.
