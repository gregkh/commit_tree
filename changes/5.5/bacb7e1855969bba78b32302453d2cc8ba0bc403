Revert "tun: call dev_get_valid_name() before register_netdevice()"

This reverts commit 0ad646c81b2182f7fa67ec0c8c825e0ee165696d.

As noticed by Jakub, this is no longer needed after
commit 11fc7d5a0a2d ("tun: fix memory leak in error path")

This no longer exports dev_get_valid_name() for the exclusive
use of tun driver.
