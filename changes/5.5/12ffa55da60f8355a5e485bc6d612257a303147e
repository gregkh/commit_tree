drm/amdgpu: Fix bugs in amdgpu_device_gpu_recover in XGMI case.

Issue 1:
In  XGMI case amdgpu_device_lock_adev for other devices in hive
was called to late, after access to their repsective schedulers.
So relocate the lock to the begining of accessing the other devs.

Issue 2:
Using amdgpu_device_ip_need_full_reset to switch the device list from
all devices in hive to the single 'master' device who owns this reset
call is wrong because when stopping schedulers we iterate all the devices
in hive but when restarting we will only reactivate the 'master' device.
Also, in case amdgpu_device_pre_asic_reset conlcudes that full reset IS
needed we then have to stop schedulers for all devices in hive and not
only the 'master' but with amdgpu_device_ip_need_full_reset  we
already missed the opprotunity do to so. So just remove this logic and
always stop and start all schedulers for all devices in hive.

Also minor cleanup and print fix.

v4: Minor coding style fix.
