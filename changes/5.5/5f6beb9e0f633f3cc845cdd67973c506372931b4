af_unix: add compat_ioctl support

The af_unix protocol family has a custom ioctl command (inexplicibly
based on SIOCPROTOPRIVATE), but never had a compat_ioctl handler for
32-bit applications.

Since all commands are compatible here, add a trivial wrapper that
performs the compat_ptr() conversion for SIOCOUTQ/SIOCINQ.  SIOCUNIXFILE
does not use the argument, but it doesn't hurt to also use compat_ptr()
here.
