arm64: kaslr: Check command line before looking for a seed

Now that we print diagnostics at boot the reason why we do not initialise
KASLR matters. Currently we check for a seed before we check if the user
has explicitly disabled KASLR on the command line which will result in
misleading diagnostics so reverse the order of those checks. We still
parse the seed from the DT early so that if the user has both provided a
seed and disabled KASLR on the command line we still mask the seed on
the command line.
