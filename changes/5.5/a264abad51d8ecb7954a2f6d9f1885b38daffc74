SUNRPC: Capture completion of all RPC tasks

RPC tasks on the backchannel never invoke xprt_complete_rqst(), so
there is no way to report their tk_status at completion. Also, any
RPC task that exits via rpc_exit_task() before it is replied to will
also disappear without a trace.

Introduce a trace point that is symmetrical with rpc_task_begin that
captures the termination status of each RPC task.

Sample trace output for callback requests initiated on the server:
   kworker/u8:12-448   [003]   127.025240: rpc_task_end:         task:50@3 flags=ASYNC|DYNAMIC|SOFT|SOFTCONN|SENT runstate=RUNNING|ACTIVE status=0 action=rpc_exit_task
   kworker/u8:12-448   [002]   127.567310: rpc_task_end:         task:51@3 flags=ASYNC|DYNAMIC|SOFT|SOFTCONN|SENT runstate=RUNNING|ACTIVE status=0 action=rpc_exit_task
   kworker/u8:12-448   [001]   130.506817: rpc_task_end:         task:52@3 flags=ASYNC|DYNAMIC|SOFT|SOFTCONN|SENT runstate=RUNNING|ACTIVE status=0 action=rpc_exit_task

Odd, though, that I never see trace_rpc_task_complete, either in the
forward or backchannel. Should it be removed?
