memory: samsung: exynos5422-dmc: Add support for interrupt from performance counters

Introduce a new interrupt driven mechanism for managing speed of the
memory controller. The interrupts are generated due to performance
counters overflow. The performance counters might track memory reads,
writes, transfers, page misses, etc. In the basic algorithm tracking
read transfers and calculating memory pressure should be enough to skip
polling mode in devfreq.
