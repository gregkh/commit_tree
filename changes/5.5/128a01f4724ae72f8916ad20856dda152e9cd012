drm/amdgpu: make pmu support optional, again

When CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS is disabled, we cannot compile the pmu
portion of the amdgpu driver:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_pmu.c:48:38: error: no member named 'hw' in 'struct perf_event'
        struct hw_perf_event *hwc = &event->hw;
                                     ~~~~~  ^
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_pmu.c:51:13: error: no member named 'attr' in 'struct perf_event'
        if (event->attr.type != event->pmu->type)
            ~~~~~  ^
...

The same bug was already fixed by commit d155bef0636e ("amdgpu: make pmu
support optional") but broken again by what looks like an incorrectly
rebased patch.
