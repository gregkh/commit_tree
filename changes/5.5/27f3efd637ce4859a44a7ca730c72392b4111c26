scsi: lpfc: Fix lockdep errors in sli_ringtx_put

Fix lockdep error in __lpfc_sli_ringtx_put(): The hbalock is valid for
sli3, but not for sli4.  Change lockdep to look at ring lock if sli4.

Also update comment in __lpfc_sli_issue_iocb_s4() to reflect proper
lock. Note: lockdep check is already correct.
