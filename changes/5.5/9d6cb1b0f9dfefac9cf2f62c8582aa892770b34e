btrfs: raid56: reduce indentation in lock_stripe_add

In lock_stripe_add() we're traversing the stripe hash list and check if
the current list element's raid_map equals is equal to the raid bio's
raid_map. If both are equal we continue processing.

If we'd check for inequality instead of equality we can reduce one level
of indentation.
