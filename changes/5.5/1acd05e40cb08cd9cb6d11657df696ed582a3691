EDAC: i5400_edac: print type at debug message

There are 3 types of non-recoverable errors that the MC reports:

	- Fatal;
	- Non-fatal uncorrected
	- Non-fatal correctable

While we don't add it to the log itself, it could be useful to
have this at least for debug messages.

This shuts up this warning:

	drivers/edac/i5400_edac.c: In function ‘i5400_proccess_non_recoverable_info’:
	drivers/edac/i5400_edac.c:524:8: warning: variable ‘type’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
	  524 |  char *type = NULL;
	      |        ^~~~
