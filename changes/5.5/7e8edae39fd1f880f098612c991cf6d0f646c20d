ALSA: pcm: Handle special page mapping in the default mmap handler

When a driver needs to deal with a special buffer like a SG or a
vmalloc buffer, it has to set up the PCM page ops explicitly for the
corresponding helper function.  This is rather error-prone and many
people forgot or incorrectly used it.

For simplifying the call patterns and avoiding such a potential bug,
this patch enhances the PCM default mmap handler to check the
(pre-)allocated buffer type and handles the page gracefully depending
on the buffer type.  If the PCM page ops is given, the ops is still
used in a higher priority.  The new code path is only for the default
(NULL page ops) case.
