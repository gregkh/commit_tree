.gitattributes: use 'dts' diff driver for dts files

Git is gaining support to display the closest node to the diff in the
hunk header via the 'dts' diff driver.  Use that driver for all dts and
dtsi files so we can gain some more context on where the diff is.
Taking a recent commit in the kernel dts files you can see the
difference.

With this patch and an updated git

You can see that we don't know what the context node is because it isn't
shown after the '@@'.

dts is not released yet but it is staged to be in the next release[1].
One can probably build git from source and try it out.
