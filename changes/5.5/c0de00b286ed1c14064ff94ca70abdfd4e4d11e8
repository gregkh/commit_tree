MIPS: SGI-IP22/28: Use PROM for memory detection

EARLY_PRINTK uses ArcWrite (via prom_putchar) on IP22/28, which needs
to not mess up PROMs data structures. ARC PROM gives out a list of
memory chunks, which are used and which are free. This fixes the
problem of not working early printk.

By using XKPHYS spaces more than 256MB memory on Indigo2 R4k machines
is working now, too.
