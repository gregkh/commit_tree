powerpc/book3s/mm: Update Oops message to print the correct translation in use

Avoids confusion when printing Oops message like below

 Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000008bdb4
 Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]
 LE PAGE_SIZE=64K MMU=Radix MMU=Hash SMP NR_CPUS=2048 NUMA PowerNV

This was because we never clear the MMU_FTR_HPTE_TABLE feature flag
even if we run with radix translation. It was discussed that we should
look at this feature flag as an indication of the capability to run
hash translation and we should not clear the flag even if we run in
radix translation. All the code paths check for radix_enabled() check and
if found true consider we are running with radix translation. Follow the
same sequence for finding the MMU translation string to be used in Oops
message.
