net/mlx5: FPGA, support network cards with standalone FPGA

Not all mlx5 cards with FPGA device use it for network processing.

mlx5_core driver configures network connection to FPGA device
for all mlx5 cards with installed FPGA. If FPGA is not a part of
network path, driver crashes in this case

Check FPGA name in function mlx5_fpga_device_start() and continue
integrate FPGA into packets flow only for dedicated cards.
Currently there are Newton and Edison cards.
