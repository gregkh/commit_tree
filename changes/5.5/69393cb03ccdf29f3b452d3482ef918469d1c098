powerpc/xmon: Restrict when kernel is locked down

Xmon should be either fully or partially disabled depending on the
kernel lockdown state.

Put xmon into read-only mode for lockdown=integrity and prevent user
entry into xmon when lockdown=confidentiality. Xmon checks the lockdown
state on every attempted entry:

 (1) during early xmon'ing

 (2) when triggered via sysrq

 (3) when toggled via debugfs

 (4) when triggered via a previously enabled breakpoint

The following lockdown state transitions are handled:

 (1) lockdown=none -> lockdown=integrity
     set xmon read-only mode

 (2) lockdown=none -> lockdown=confidentiality
     clear all breakpoints, set xmon read-only mode,
     prevent user re-entry into xmon

 (3) lockdown=integrity -> lockdown=confidentiality
     clear all breakpoints, set xmon read-only mode,
     prevent user re-entry into xmon
