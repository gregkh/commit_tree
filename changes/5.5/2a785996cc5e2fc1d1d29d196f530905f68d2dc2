y2038: uapi: change __kernel_time_t to __kernel_old_time_t

This is mainly a patch for clarification, and to let us remove
the time_t definition from the kernel to prevent new users from
creeping in that might not be y2038-safe.

All remaining uses of 'time_t' or '__kernel_time_t' are part of
the user API that cannot be changed by that either have a
replacement or that do not suffer from the y2038 overflow.
