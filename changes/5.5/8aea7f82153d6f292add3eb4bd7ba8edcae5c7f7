drivers/hv: Replace binary semaphore with mutex

At a slight footprint cost (24 vs 32 bytes), mutexes are more optimal
than semaphores; it's also a nicer interface for mutual exclusion,
which is why they are encouraged over binary semaphores, when possible.

Replace the hyperv_mmio_lock, its semantics implies traditional lock
ownership; that is, the lock owner is the same for both lock/unlock
operations. Therefore it is safe to convert.
