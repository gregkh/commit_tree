afs: Fix SELinux setting security label on /afs

Make the AFS dynamic root superblock R/W so that SELinux can set the
security label on it.  Without this, upgrades to, say, the Fedora
filesystem-afs RPM fail if afs is mounted on it because the SELinux label
can't be (re-)applied.

It might be better to make it possible to bypass the R/O check for LSM
label application through setxattr.
