media: flexcop-usb: ensure -EIO is returned on error condition

An earlier commit hard coded a return 0 to function flexcop_usb_i2c_req
even though the an -EIO was intended to be returned in the case where
ret != buflen.  Fix this by replacing the return 0 with the return of
ret to return the error return code.
