pidfd: add tests for NSpid info in fdinfo

Add a test that checks that if pid namespaces are configured the fdinfo
file of a pidfd contains an NSpid: entry containing the process id in
the current and additionally all nested namespaces. In the case that
a pidfd is from a pid namespace not in the same namespace hierarchy as
the process accessing the fdinfo file, ensure the 'NSpid' shows 0 for
that pidfd, analogous to the 'Pid' entry.
