arch: rely on asm-generic/io.h for default ioremap_* definitions

Various architectures that use asm-generic/io.h still defined their
own default versions of ioremap_nocache, ioremap_wt and ioremap_wc
that point back to plain ioremap directly or indirectly.  Remove these
definitions and rely on asm-generic/io.h instead.  For this to work
the backup ioremap_* defintions needs to be changed to purely cpp
macros instea of inlines to cover for architectures like openrisc
that only define ioremap after including <asm-generic/io.h>.
