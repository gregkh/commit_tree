media: cedrus: Fix decoding for some H264 videos

It seems that for some H264 videos at least one bitstream parsing
trigger must be called in order to be decoded correctly. There is no
explanation why this helps, but it was observed that two sample videos
with this fix are now decoded correctly and there is no regression with
others.
