RDMA/hns: Redefine the member of hns_roce_cq struct

There is no need to package buf and mtt into hns_roce_cq_buf, which will
make code more complex, just delete this struct and move buf and mtt into
hns_roce_cq. Furthermore, we add size member for hns_roce_buf to avoid
repeatly calculating where needed it.
