vsock: fix bind() behaviour taking care of CID

When we are looking for a socket bound to a specific address,
we also have to take into account the CID.

This patch is useful with multi-transports support because it
allows the binding of the same port with different CID, and
it prevents a connection to a wrong socket bound to the same
port, but with different CID.
