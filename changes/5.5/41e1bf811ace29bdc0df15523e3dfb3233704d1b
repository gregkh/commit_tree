Staging: qlge: Rewrite two while loops as simple for loops

This is a task from the TODO list of qlge driver:
 - some "while" loops could be rewritten with simple "for"

The change is in functions ql_wait_reg_rdy and ql_wait_cfg in qlge_main.c.
The while loops are basically count based
(they decrement on each iteration),
and it makes more sense to be a for loop construction instead.
