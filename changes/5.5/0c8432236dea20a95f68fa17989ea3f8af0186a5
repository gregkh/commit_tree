HID: i2c-hid: fix no irq after reset on raydium 3118

On some ThinkPad L390 some raydium 3118 touchscreen devices
doesn't response any data after reset, but some does.

Add this ID to no irq quirk,
then don't wait for any response alike on these touchscreens.
All kinds of raydium 3118 devices work fine.
