kvm: nVMX: Relax guest IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL constraints

Commit 37e4c997dadf ("KVM: VMX: validate individual bits of guest
MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL") broke the KVM_SET_MSRS ABI by instituting
new constraints on the data values that kvm would accept for the guest
MSR, IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL. Perhaps these constraints should have been
opt-in via a new KVM capability, but they were applied
indiscriminately, breaking at least one existing hypervisor.

Relax the constraints to allow either or both of
FEATURE_CONTROL_VMXON_ENABLED_OUTSIDE_SMX and
FEATURE_CONTROL_VMXON_ENABLED_INSIDE_SMX to be set when nVMX is
enabled. This change is sufficient to fix the aforementioned breakage.
