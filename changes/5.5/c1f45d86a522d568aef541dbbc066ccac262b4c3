libnvdimm/pfn_dev: Don't clear device memmap area during generic namespace probe

nvdimm core use nd_pfn_validate when looking for devdax or fsdax namespace. In this
case device resources are allocated against nd_namespace_io dev. In-order to
allow remap of range in nd_pfn_clear_memmap_error(), move the device memmap
area clearing while initializing pfn namespace. With this device
resource are allocated against nd_pfn and we can use nd_pfn->dev for remapping.

This also avoids calling nd_pfn_clear_mmap_errors twice. Once while probing the
namespace and second while initializing a pfn namespace.
