perf/core: Add SRCU annotation for pmus list walk

Since commit
   28875945ba98d ("rcu: Add support for consolidated-RCU reader checking")

there is an additional check to ensure that a RCU related lock is held
while the RCU list is iterated.
This section holds the SRCU reader lock instead.

Add annotation to list_for_each_entry_rcu() that pmus_srcu must be
acquired during the list traversal.
