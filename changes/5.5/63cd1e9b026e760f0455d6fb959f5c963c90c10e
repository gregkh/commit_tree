xfs: move xfs_fc_reconfigure() above xfs_fc_free()

Grouping the options parsing and mount handling functions above the
struct fs_context_operations but below the struct super_operations
should improve (some) the grouping of the super operations while also
improving the grouping of the options parsing and mount handling code.

Start by moving xfs_fc_reconfigure() and friends.
This is a straight code move, there aren't any functional changes.
