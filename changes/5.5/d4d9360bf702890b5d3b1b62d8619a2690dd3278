ASoC: rsnd: dma: set bus width to data width for monaural data

According to R-Car3 HW manual 40.3.3 (Data Format on Audio Local Bus),
in case of monaural data writing or reading through Audio-DMAC,
it's always in Left Justified format, so both src and dst
DMA Bus width should be equal to physical data width.

Therefore set src and dst's DMA bus width to:
 - [monaural case] data width
 - [non-monaural case] 32bits (as prior applying the patch)
