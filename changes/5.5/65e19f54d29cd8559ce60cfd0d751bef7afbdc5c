io_uring: support for larger fixed file sets

There's been a few requests for supporting more fixed files than 1024.
This isn't really tricky to do, we just need to split up the file table
into multiple tables and index appropriately. As we do so, reduce the
max single file table to 512. This enables us to do single page allocs
always for the tables, which is an improvement over the situation prior.

This patch adds support for up to 64K files, which should be enough for
everyone.
