libbpf: Teach bpf_object__open to guess program types

Teach bpf_object__open how to guess program type and expected attach
type from section names, similar to what bpf_prog_load() does. This
seems like a really useful features and an oversight to not have this
done during bpf_object_open(). To preserver backwards compatible
behavior of bpf_prog_load(), its attr->prog_type is treated as an
override of bpf_object__open() decisions, if attr->prog_type is not
UNSPECIFIED.

There is a slight difference in behavior for bpf_prog_load().
Previously, if bpf_prog_load() was loading BPF object with more than one
program, first program's guessed program type and expected attach type
would determine corresponding attributes of all the subsequent program
types, even if their sections names suggest otherwise. That seems like
a rather dubious behavior and with this change it will behave more
sanely: each program's type is determined individually, unless they are
forced to uniformity through attr->prog_type.
