ALSA: seq: Fix racy access for queue timer in proc read

snd_seq_info_timer_read() reads the information of the timer assigned
for each queue, but it's done in a racy way which may lead to UAF as
spotted by syzkaller.

This patch applies the missing q->timer_mutex lock while accessing the
timer object as well as a slight code change to adapt the standard
coding style.
