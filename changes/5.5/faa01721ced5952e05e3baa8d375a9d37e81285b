ice: use more accurate ICE_DBG mask types

ice_debug_cq is passed a mask which is always ICE_DBG_AQ_CMD. Modify this
function, removing the mask parameter entirely, and directly use the more
appropriate ICE_DBG_AQ_DESC and ICE_DBG_AQ_DESC_BUF.

The function is only called from ice_controlq.c, and has no
other callers outside of that file. Move it and mark it static to avoid
namespace pollution.
