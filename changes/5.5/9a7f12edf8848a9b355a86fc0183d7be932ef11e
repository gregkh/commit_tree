fcntl: fix typo in RWH_WRITE_LIFE_NOT_SET r/w hint name

According to commit message in the original commit c75b1d9421f8 ("fs:
add fcntl() interface for setting/getting write life time hints"),
as well as userspace library[1] and man page update[2], R/W hint constants
are intended to have RWH_* prefix. However, RWF_WRITE_LIFE_NOT_SET retained
"RWF_*" prefix used in the early versions of the proposed patch set[3].
Rename it and provide the old name as a synonym for the new one
for backward compatibility.
