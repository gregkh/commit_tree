PCI: Add DMA alias quirk for Intel VCA NTB

Intel Visual Compute Accelerator (VCA) is a family of PCIe add-in devices
exposing computational units via Non Transparent Bridges (NTB, PEX 87xx).

Similarly to MIC x200, we need to add DMA aliases to allow buffer access
when IOMMU is enabled.

Add aliases to allow computational unit access to host memory.  These
aliases mark the whole VCA device as one IOMMU group.

All possible slot numbers (0x20) are used, since we are unable to tell what
slot is used on other side.  This quirk is intended for both host and
computational unit sides.  The VCA devices have up to five functions: four
for DMA channels and one additional.
