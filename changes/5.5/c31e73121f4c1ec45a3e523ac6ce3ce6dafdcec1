base: soc: Handle custom soc information sysfs entries

Soc framework exposed sysfs entries are not sufficient for some
of the h/w platforms. Currently there is no interface where soc
drivers can expose further information about their SoCs via soc
framework. This change address this limitation where clients can
pass their custom entries as attribute group and soc framework
would expose them as sysfs properties.
