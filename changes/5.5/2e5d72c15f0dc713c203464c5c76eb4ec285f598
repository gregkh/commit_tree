samples/bpf: Add XDP_SHARED_UMEM support to xdpsock

Add support for the XDP_SHARED_UMEM mode to the xdpsock sample
application. As libbpf does not have a built in XDP program for this
mode, we use an explicitly loaded XDP program. This also serves as an
example on how to write your own XDP program that can route to an
AF_XDP socket.
