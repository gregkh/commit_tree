drm: damage_helper: Fix race checking plane->state->fb

Since the dirtyfb ioctl doesn't give us any hints as to which plane is
scanning out the fb it's marking as damaged, we need to loop through
planes to find it.

Currently we just reach into plane state and check, but that can race
with another commit changing the fb out from under us. This patch locks
the plane before checking the fb and will release the lock if the plane
is not displaying the dirty fb.
