samples: bpf: Add max_pckt_size option at xdp_adjust_tail

Currently, at xdp_adjust_tail_kern.c, MAX_PCKT_SIZE is limited
to 600. To make this size flexible, static global variable
'max_pcktsz' is added.

By updating new packet size from the user space, xdp_adjust_tail_kern.o
will use this value as a new max packet size.

This static global variable can be accesible from .data section with
bpf_object__find_map* from user space, since it is considered as
internal map (accessible with .bss/.data/.rodata suffix).

If no '-P <MAX_PCKT_SIZE>' option is used, the size of maximum packet
will be 600 as a default.

For clarity, change the helper to fetch map from 'bpf_map__next'
to 'bpf_object__find_map_fd_by_name'. Also, changed the way to
test prog_fd, map_fd from '!= 0' to '< 0', since fd could be 0
when stdin is closed.
