i2c: tegra: Fix suspending in active runtime PM state

I noticed that sometime I2C clock is kept enabled during suspend-resume.
This happens because runtime PM defers dynamic suspension and thus it may
happen that runtime PM is in active state when system enters into suspend.
In particular I2C controller that is used for CPU's DVFS is often kept ON
during suspend because CPU's voltage scaling happens quite often.
