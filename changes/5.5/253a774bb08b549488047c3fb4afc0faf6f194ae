drm/i915/execlists: Don't merely skip submission if maybe timeslicing

Normally, we try and skip submission if ELSP[1] is filled. However, we
may desire to enable timeslicing due to the queue priority, even if
ELSP[1] itself does not require timeslicing. That is the queue is equal
priority to ELSP[0] and higher priority then ELSP[1]. Previously, we
would wait until the context switch to preempt the current ELSP[1], but
with timeslicing, we want to preempt ELSP[0] and replace it with the
queue.

In writing the test case, it become quickly apparent that we were also
suppressing the tasklet during promotion and so failing to notice when
the queue started requiring timeslicing.
