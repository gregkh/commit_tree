btrfs: volumes: Use more straightforward way to calculate map length

The old code goes:

 	offset = logical - em->start;
	length = min_t(u64, em->len - offset, length);

Where @length calculation is dependent on offset, it can take reader
several more seconds to find it's just the same code as:

 	offset = logical - em->start;
	length = min_t(u64, em->start + em->len - logical, length);

Use above code to make the length calculate independent from other
variable, thus slightly increase the readability.
