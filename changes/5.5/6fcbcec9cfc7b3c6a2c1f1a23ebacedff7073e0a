fs/quota: handle overflows of sysctl fs.quota.* and report as unsigned long

Quota statistics counted as 64-bit per-cpu counter. Reading sums per-cpu
fractions as signed 64-bit int, filters negative values and then reports
lower half as signed 32-bit int.

Result may looks like:

fs.quota.allocated_dquots = 22327
fs.quota.cache_hits = -489852115
fs.quota.drops = -487288718
fs.quota.free_dquots = 22083
fs.quota.lookups = -486883485
fs.quota.reads = 22327
fs.quota.syncs = 335064
fs.quota.writes = 3088689

Values bigger than 2^31-1 reported as negative.

All counters except "allocated_dquots" and "free_dquots" are monotonic,
thus they should be reported as is without filtering negative values.

Kernel doesn't have generic helper for 64-bit sysctl yet,
let's use at least unsigned long.
