powerpc: Don't flush caches when adding memory

This operation takes a significant amount of time when hotplugging
large amounts of memory (~50 seconds with 890GB of persistent memory).

This was orignally in commit fb5924fddf9e
("powerpc/mm: Flush cache on memory hot(un)plug") to support memtrace,
but the flush on add is not needed as it is flushed on remove.
