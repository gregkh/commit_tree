x86/math-emu: Limit MATH_EMULATION to 486SX compatibles

The FPU emulation code is old and fragile in places, try to limit its
use to builds for CPUs that actually use it. As far as I can tell,
this is only true for i486sx compatibles, including the Cyrix 486SLC,
AMD Am486SX and Ã‰LAN SC410, UMC U5S amd DM&P VortexSX86, all of which
were relatively short-lived and got replaced with i486DX compatible
processors soon after introduction, though some of the embedded versions
remained available much longer.
