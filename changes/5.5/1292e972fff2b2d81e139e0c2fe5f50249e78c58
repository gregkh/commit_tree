io_uring: fix compat for IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE

fds field of struct io_uring_files_update is problematic with regards
to compat user space, as pointer size is different in 32-bit, 32-on-64-bit,
and 64-bit user space.  In order to avoid custom handling of compat in
the syscall implementation, make fds __u64 and use u64_to_user_ptr in
order to retrieve it.  Also, align the field naturally and check that
no garbage is passed there.
