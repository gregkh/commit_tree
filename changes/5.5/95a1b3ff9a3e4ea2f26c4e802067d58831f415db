io_uring: Fix mm_fault with READ/WRITE_FIXED

Commit fb5ccc98782f ("io_uring: Fix broken links with offloading")
introduced a potential performance regression with unconditionally
taking mm even for READ/WRITE_FIXED operations.

Return the logic handling it back. mm-faulted requests will go through
the generic submission path, so honoring links and drains, but will
fail further on req->has_user check.
