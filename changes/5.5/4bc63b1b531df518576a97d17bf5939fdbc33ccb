net: openvswitch: convert mask list in mask array

Port the codes to linux upstream and with little changes.

Pravin B Shelar, says:
| mask caches index of mask in mask_list. On packet recv OVS
| need to traverse mask-list to get cached mask. Therefore array
| is better for retrieving cached mask. This also allows better
| cache replacement algorithm by directly checking mask's existence.
