perf tools: Use perf_mmap way to detect aux mmap

We will move this code to libperf shortly, so we need to free it of
'struct auxtrace_mmap' usage, because it won't be available in libperf
(for now).

The perf_event_mmap_page::aux_size is set when the aux mmap is mapped,
so the check is equivalent.
