ice: configure software LLDP in ice_init_pf_dcb

Move software LLDP configuration when FW DCBX is disabled to
ice_init_pf_dcb, since that is where the FW DCBX state is determined.
Remove this software LLDP configuration from ice_vsi_setup and
ice_set_priv_flags. Software configuration includes redirecting Rx LLDP
packets up the stack, when FW DCBX is not running.
