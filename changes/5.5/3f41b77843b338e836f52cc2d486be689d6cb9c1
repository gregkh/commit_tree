perf trace: Add a strtoul() method to 'struct syscall_arg_fmt'

This will go from a string to a number, so that filter expressions can
be constructed with strings and then, before applying the tracepoint
filters (or eBPF, in the future) we can map those strings to numbers.

The first one will be for 'msr' tracepoint arguments, but real quickly
we will be able to reuse all strarrays for that.
