clk: tegra: periph: Add restore_context support

This patch implements restore_context support for clk-periph and
clk-sdmmc-mux clock operations to restore clock parent and rates
on system resume.

During system suspend, core power goes off and looses the context
of the Tegra clock controller registers.

So on system resume, clocks parent and rate are restored back to
the context before suspend based on cached data.
