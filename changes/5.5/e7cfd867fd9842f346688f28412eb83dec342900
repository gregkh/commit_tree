ASoC: rt5645: Fixed buddy jack support.

The headphone jack on buddy was broken with the following commit:
commit 6b5da66322c5 ("ASoC: rt5645: read jd1_1 status for jd
detection").
This changes the jd_mode for buddy to 4 so buddy can read from the same
register that was used in the working version of this driver without
affecting any other devices that might use this, since no other device uses
jd_mode = 4. To test this I plugged and uplugged the headphone jack, verifying
audio works.
