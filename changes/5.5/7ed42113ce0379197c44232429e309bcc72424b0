ocxl: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier

This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style
in header files for Open Coherent Accelerator (OCXL) compatible device
drivers. For C header files Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
mandates C-like comments (opposed to C source files where
C++ style should be used)
