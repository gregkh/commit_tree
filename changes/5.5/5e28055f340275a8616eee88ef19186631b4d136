USB: serial: opticon: fix control-message timeouts

The driver was issuing synchronous uninterruptible control requests
without using a timeout. This could lead to the driver hanging
on open() or tiocmset() due to a malfunctioning (or malicious) device
until the device is physically disconnected.

The USB upper limit of five seconds per request should be more than
enough.
