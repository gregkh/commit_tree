xfs: turn ic_state into an enum

ic_state really is a set of different states, even if the values are
encoded as non-conflicting bits and we sometimes use logical and
operations to check for them.  Switch all comparisms to check for
exact values (and use switch statements in a few places to make it
more clear) and turn the values into an implicitly enumerated enum
type.
