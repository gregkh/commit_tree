ASoC: soc-core: use devm_xxx for component related resource

dai / component related resources are created when component is
registered, and it will be freed when component was unregistered.
These resources are not re-used after that.
This means, we can use devm_xxx for dai / component, without
thinking about kfree().
This patch uses devm_xxx for these.
