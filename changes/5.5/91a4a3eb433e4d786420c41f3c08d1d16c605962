tipc: fix wrong socket reference counter after tipc_sk_timeout() returns

When tipc_sk_timeout() is executed but user space is grabbing
ownership, this function rearms itself and returns. However, the
socket reference counter is not reduced. This causes potential
unexpected behavior.

This commit fixes it by calling sock_put() before tipc_sk_timeout()
returns in the above-mentioned case.
