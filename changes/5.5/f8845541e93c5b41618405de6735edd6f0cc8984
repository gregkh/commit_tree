KVM: x86: Fold 'enum kvm_ex_reg' definitions into 'enum kvm_reg'

Now that indexing into arch.regs is either protected by WARN_ON_ONCE or
done with hardcoded enums, combine all definitions for registers that
are tracked by regs_avail and regs_dirty into 'enum kvm_reg'.  Having a
single enum type will simplify additional cleanup related to regs_avail
and regs_dirty.
