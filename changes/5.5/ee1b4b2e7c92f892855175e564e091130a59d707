Input: hp_sdc_rtc - remove dead chardev code

The driver contains half of the implementation of /dev/rtc, but this
was never completed, and it is now incompatible with the drivers/rtc
framework.

Remove the chardev completely. If anyone wants to add the functionality
later, that shoudl be done through rtc_register_device().

The remaining portions of the driver basically implement a single
procfs file that may or may not be used anywhere. Not sure why this
is in drivers/input/ though.
