module: Remove accidental change of module_enable_x()

When pulling in Divya Indi's patch, I made a minor fix to remove unneeded
braces. I commited my fix up via "git commit -a --amend". Unfortunately, I
didn't realize I had some changes I was testing in the module code, and
those changes were applied to Divya's patch as well.

This reverts the accidental updates to the module code.
