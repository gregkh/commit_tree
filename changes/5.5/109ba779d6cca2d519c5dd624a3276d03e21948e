ext4: check for directory entries too close to block end

ext4_check_dir_entry() currently does not catch a case when a directory
entry ends so close to the block end that the header of the next
directory entry would not fit in the remaining space. This can lead to
directory iteration code trying to access address beyond end of current
buffer head leading to oops.
