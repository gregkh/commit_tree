fs/userfaultfd.c: wp: clear VM_UFFD_MISSING or VM_UFFD_WP during userfaultfd_register()

If the registration is repeated without VM_UFFD_MISSING or VM_UFFD_WP they
need to be cleared.  Currently setting UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP returns
-EINVAL, so this patch is a noop until the UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP support
is applied.
