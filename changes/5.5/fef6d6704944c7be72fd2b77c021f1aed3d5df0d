selftests: mlxsw: qos_mc_aware: Fix mausezahn invocation

Mausezahn does not recognize "own" as a keyword on source IP address. As a
result, the MC stream is not running at all, and therefore no UC
degradation can be observed even in principle.

Fix the invocation, and tighten the test: due to the minimum shaper
configured at the MC TCs, we always expect about 20% degradation. Fail the
test if it is lower.
