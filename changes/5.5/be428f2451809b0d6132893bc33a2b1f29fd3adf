drm/arm: make undeclared items static

Make the following items static to avoid clashes with
other parts of the kernel (dev_attr_core_id) or just
silence the following sparse warning:

drivers/gpu/drm/arm/malidp_drv.c:371:24: warning: symbol 'malidp_fb_create' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/gpu/drm/arm/malidp_drv.c:494:6: warning: symbol 'malidp_error_stats_dump' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/gpu/drm/arm/malidp_drv.c:668:1: warning: symbol 'dev_attr_core_id' was not declared. Should it be static?
