airo: Add missing CAP_NET_ADMIN check in AIROOLDIOCTL/SIOCDEVPRIVATE

The driver for Cisco Aironet 4500 and 4800 series cards (airo.c),
implements AIROOLDIOCTL/SIOCDEVPRIVATE in airo_ioctl().

The ioctl handler copies an aironet_ioctl struct from userspace, which
includes a command. Some of the commands are handled in readrids(),
where the user controlled command is converted into a driver-internal
value called "ridcode".

There are two command values, AIROGWEPKTMP and AIROGWEPKNV, which
correspond to ridcode values of RID_WEP_TEMP and RID_WEP_PERM
respectively. These commands both have checks that the user has
CAP_NET_ADMIN, with the comment that "Only super-user can read WEP
keys", otherwise they return -EPERM.

However there is another command value, AIRORRID, that lets the user
specify the ridcode value directly, with no other checks. This means
the user can bypass the CAP_NET_ADMIN check on AIROGWEPKTMP and
AIROGWEPKNV.

Fix it by moving the CAP_NET_ADMIN check out of the command handling
and instead do it later based on the ridcode. That way regardless of
whether the ridcode is set via AIROGWEPKTMP or AIROGWEPKNV, or passed
in using AIRORID, we always do the CAP_NET_ADMIN check.

Found by Ilja by code inspection, not tested as I don't have the
required hardware.
