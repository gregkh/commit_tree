powerpc/watchpoint: Add DAR outside test in perf-hwbreak.c selftest

So far we used to ignore exception if DAR points outside of user
specified range. But now we are ignoring it only if actual load/store
range does not overlap with user specified range. Include selftests
for the same:

  # ./tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/ptrace/perf-hwbreak
  ...
  TESTED: No overlap
  TESTED: Partial overlap
  TESTED: Partial overlap
  TESTED: No overlap
  TESTED: Full overlap
  success: perf_hwbreak
