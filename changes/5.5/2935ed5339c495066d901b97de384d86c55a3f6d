drm/i915: Remove logical HW ID

With the introduction of ctx->engines[] we allow multiple logical
contexts to be used on the same engine (e.g. with virtual engines).
According to bspec, aach logical context requires a unique tag in order
for context-switching to occur correctly between them. [Simple
experiments show that it is not so easy to trick the HW into performing
a lite-restore with matching logical IDs, though my memory from early
Broadwell experiments do suggest that it should be generating
lite-restores.]

We only need to keep a unique tag for the active lifetime of the
context, and for as long as we need to identify that context. The HW
uses the tag to determine if it should use a lite-restore (why not the
LRCA?) and passes the tag back for various status identifies. The only
status we need to track is for OA, so when using perf, we assign the
specific context a unique tag.

v2: Calculate required number of tags to fill ELSP.
