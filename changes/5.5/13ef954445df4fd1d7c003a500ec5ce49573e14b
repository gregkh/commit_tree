iomap: Allow forcing of waiting for running DIO in iomap_dio_rw()

Filesystems do not support doing IO as asynchronous in some cases. For
example in case of unaligned writes or in case file size needs to be
extended (e.g. for ext4). Instead of forcing filesystem to wait for AIO
in such cases, add argument to iomap_dio_rw() which makes the function
wait for IO completion. This also results in executing
iomap_dio_complete() inline in iomap_dio_rw() providing its return value
to the caller as for ordinary sync IO.
