mm: move the backup x_devmap() functions to asm-generic/pgtable.h

The asm-generic/pgtable.h include file appears to be the correct place for
the backup x_devmap() inline functions.  Moving them here is also
necessary if we want to include x_devmap() in the [pmd|pud]_unstable
functions.  So move the x_devmap() functions to asm-generic/pgtable.h
