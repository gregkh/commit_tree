drm/i915: protect access to DP_TP_* on non-dp

DP_TP_{CTL,STATUS} should only be programmed when the encoder is intel_dp.
Checking its current usages intel_disable_ddi_buf() is the only
offender, with other places being protected by checks like
pipe_config->fec_enable that is only set by intel_dp.

v3 (José):
- Using intel_crtc_has_dp_encoder() instead of intel_encoder_is_dp()
