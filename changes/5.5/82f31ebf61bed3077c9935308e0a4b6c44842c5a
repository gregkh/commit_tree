net: port < inet_prot_sock(net) --> inet_port_requires_bind_service(net, port)

Note that the sysctl write accessor functions guarantee that:
  net->ipv4.sysctl_ip_prot_sock <= net->ipv4.ip_local_ports.range[0]
invariant is maintained, and as such the max() in selinux hooks is actually spurious.

ie. even though
  if (snum < max(inet_prot_sock(sock_net(sk)), low) || snum > high) {
per logic is the same as
  if ((snum < inet_prot_sock(sock_net(sk)) && snum < low) || snum > high) {
it is actually functionally equivalent to:
  if (snum < low || snum > high) {
which is equivalent to:
  if (snum < inet_prot_sock(sock_net(sk)) || snum < low || snum > high) {
even though the first clause is spurious.

But we want to hold on to it in case we ever want to change what what
inet_port_requires_bind_service() means (for example by changing
it from a, by default, [0..1024) range to some sort of set).

Test: builds, git 'grep inet_prot_sock' finds no other references
