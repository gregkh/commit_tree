kunit: test: add KUnit test runner core

Add core facilities for defining unit tests; this provides a common way
to define test cases, functions that execute code which is under test
and determine whether the code under test behaves as expected; this also
provides a way to group together related test cases in test suites (here
we call them test_modules).

Just define test cases and how to execute them for now; setting
expectations on code will be defined later.
