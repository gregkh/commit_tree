Revert "drm/amdgpu/nbio7.4: add hw bug workaround for vega20"

This reverts commit e01f2d41895102d824c6b8f5e011dd5e286d5e8b.

VG20 did not require this workaround, as the fix is in the VBIOS.
Leave VG10/12 workaround as some older shipped cards do not have the
VBIOS fix in place, and the kernel workaround is required in those
situations
