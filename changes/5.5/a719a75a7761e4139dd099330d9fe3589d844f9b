mtd: spi-nor: fix silent truncation in spi_nor_read()

spi_nor_read() assigns the result of 'ssize_t spi_nor_read_data()'
to the 'int ret' variable, while 'ssize_t' is a 64-bit type and *int*
is a 32-bit type on the 64-bit machines. This silent truncation isn't
really valid, so fix up the variable's type.
