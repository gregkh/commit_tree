platform/x86: intel_cht_int33fe: Split code to Micro-B and Type-C

Existing intel_cht_int33fe ACPI pseudo-device driver assumes that
hardware has Type-C connector and register related devices described as
I2C connections in the _CRS resource.

There is at least one hardware (Lenovo Yoga Book YB1-91L/F) with Micro-B
USB connector exists. It has INT33FE device in the DSDT table but
there are only two I2C connection described: PMIC and BQ27452 battery
fuel gauge.

Splitting existing INT33FE driver allow to maintain code for USB Micro-B
(or AB) connector variant separately and make it simpler.

Split driver to intel_cht_int33fe_common.c and
intel_cht_int33fe_{microb,typec}.c. Compile all this sources to one .ko
module to make user experience easier.
