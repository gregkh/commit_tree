drm/i915/perf: Allow non-privileged access when OA buffer is not sampled

SAMPLE_OA_REPORT enables sampling of OA reports from the OA buffer.
Since reports from OA buffer had system wide visibility, collecting
samples from the OA buffer was a privileged operation on previous
platforms. Prior to TGL, it was also necessary to sample the OA buffer
to normalize reports from MI REPORT PERF COUNT.

TGL has a dedicated OAR unit to sample perf reports for a specific
render context. This removes the necessity to sample OA buffer.

- If not sampling the OA buffer, allow non-privileged access. An earlier
  patch allows the non-privilege access:

- Clear up the path for non-privileged access in this patch
