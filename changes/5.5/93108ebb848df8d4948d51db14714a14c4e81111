jbd2: Move dropping of jh reference out of un/re-filing functions

__jbd2_journal_unfile_buffer() and __jbd2_journal_refile_buffer() drop
transaction's jh reference when they remove jh from a transaction. This
will be however inconvenient once we move state lock into journal_head
itself as we still need to unlock it and we'd need to grab jh reference
just for that. Move dropping of jh reference out of these functions into
the few callers.
