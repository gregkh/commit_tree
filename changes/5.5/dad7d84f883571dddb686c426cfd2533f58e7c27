drm/dp_mst: Don't forget to update port->input in drm_dp_mst_handle_conn_stat()

This probably hasn't caused any problems up until now since it's
probably nearly impossible to encounter this in the wild, however if we
were to receive a connection status notification from the MST hub after
resume while we're in the middle of reprobing the link addresses for a
topology then there's a much larger chance that a port could have
changed from being an output port to input port (or vice versa). If we
forget to update this bit of information, we'll potentially ignore a
valid PDT change on a downstream port because we think it's an input
port.

So, make sure we read the input_port field in connection status
notifications in drm_dp_mst_handle_conn_stat() to prevent this from
happening once we've implemented suspend/resume reprobing.
