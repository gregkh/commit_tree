device_cgroup: Export devcgroup_check_permission

For AMD compute (amdkfd) driver.

All AMD compute devices are exported via single device node /dev/kfd. As
a result devices cannot be controlled individually using device cgroup.

AMD compute devices will rely on its graphics counterpart that exposes
/dev/dri/renderN node for each device. For each task (based on its
cgroup), KFD driver will check if /dev/dri/renderN node is accessible
before exposing it.
