mei: me: mei_me_dev_init() use struct device instead of struct pci_dev.

It's enough to bind mei_device with associated 'struct device' instead
of actual 'struct pci_dev'. This is to allow working with mei devices
embedded within another pci device, usually via MFD framework,
where mei device is represented as a platform device.
