arm64: entry: convert el0_sync to C

This is largely a 1-1 conversion of asm to C, with a couple of caveats.

The el0_sync{_compat} switches explicitly handle all the EL0 debug
cases, so el0_dbg doesn't have to try to bail out for unexpected EL1
debug ESR values. This also means that an unexpected vector catch from
AArch32 is routed to el0_inv.

We *could* merge the native and compat switches, which would make the
diffstat negative, but I've tried to stay as close to the existing
assembly as possible for the moment.

[split out of a bigger series, added nokprobes. removed irq trace
 calls as the C helpers do this. renamed el0_dbg's use of FAR]
