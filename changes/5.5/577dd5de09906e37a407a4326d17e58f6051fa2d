arm64: dts: juno: add GPU subsystem

Since we now have bindings for Mali Midgard GPUs, let's use them to
describe Juno's GPU subsystem, if only because we can. Juno sports a
Mali-T624 integrated behind an MMU-400 (as a gesture towards
virtualisation), in their own dedicated power domain with DVFS
controlled by the SCP.
