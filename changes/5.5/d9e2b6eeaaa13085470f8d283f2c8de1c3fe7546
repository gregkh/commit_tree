sh: ecovec24: add additional properties to the backlight device

Add a GPIO lookup entry and a device property for GPIO backlight to the
board file. Tie them to the platform device which is now registered using
platform_device_register_full() because of the properties. These changes
are inactive now but will be used once the gpio backlight driver is
modified.
