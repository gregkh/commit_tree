tools headers uapi: Sync linux/stat.h with the kernel sources

To pick the changes from:

  3ad2522c64cf ("statx: define STATX_ATTR_VERITY")

That don't trigger any changes in tooling.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/linux/stat.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/linux/stat.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/linux/stat.h include/uapi/linux/stat.h

At some point we wi'll beautify structs passed in pointers to syscalls
and then we'll need to have tables for these defines, for now update the
file to silence the warning as this file is used for doing this type of
number -> string translations for other defines found in these file.
