efi/random: use arch-independent efi_call_proto()

To handle all arch-specific peculiarities when calling an EFI protocol
function, a wrapper efi_call_proto() exists on all relevant architectures.
On arm/arm64, this is merely a plain function call. On x86, a special EFI
entry stub needs to be used, however, as the calling convention differs.
To make the efi/random stub arch-independent, use efi_call_proto()
instead of the existing non-portable calls to the EFI get_rng protocol
function. This also requires the addition of some typedefs.
