drm/bridge: panel: Infer connector type from panel by default

The drm panel bridge creates a connector using a connector type
explicitly passed by the display controller or bridge driver that
instantiates the panel bridge. Now that drm_panel reports its connector
type, we can use it to avoid passing an explicit (and often incorrect)
connector type to drm_panel_bridge_add() and
devm_drm_panel_bridge_add().

Several drivers report incorrect or unknown connector types to
userspace. Reporting a different type may result in a breakage. For that
reason, rename (devm_)drm_panel_bridge_add() to
(devm_)drm_panel_bridge_add_typed(), and add new
(devm_)drm_panel_bridge_add() functions that use the panel connector
type. Update all callers of (devm_)drm_panel_bridge_add() to the _typed
function, they will be converted one by one after testing.

The panel drivers have been updated with the following Coccinelle
semantic patch, with manual inspection and fixes to indentation.
