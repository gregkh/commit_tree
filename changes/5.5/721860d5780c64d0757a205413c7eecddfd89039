btrfs: remove pointless local variable in lock_stripe_add()

In lock_stripe_add() we're caching the bucket for the stripe hash table
just for a single call to dereference the stripe hash.

If we just directly call rbio_bucket() we can safe the pointless local
variable.

Also move the dereferencing of the stripe hash outside of the variable
declaration block to not break over the 80 characters limit.
