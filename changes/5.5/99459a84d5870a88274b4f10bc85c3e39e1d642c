perf map: Move maj/min/ino/ino_generation to separate struct

And this patch highlights where these fields are being used: in the sort
order where it uses it to compare maps and classify samples taking into
account not just the DSO, but those DSO id fields.

I think these should be used to differentiate DSOs with the same name
but different 'struct dso_id' fields, i.e. these fields should move to
'struct dso' and then be used as part of the key when doing lookups for
DSOs, in addition to the DSO name.
