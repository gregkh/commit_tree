powerpc/mm: remove pmd_huge/pud_huge stubs and include hugetlb.h

Patch series "hugetlbfs: convert macros to static inline, fix sparse
warning".

The definition for huge_pte_offset() in <linux/hugetlb.h> causes a
sparse warning in the !CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE.  Fix this as well as
converting all macros in this block of definitions to static inlines for
better type checking.

When making the above changes, build errors were found in powerpc due to
duplicate definitions.  A separate powerpc specific patch is included as
a requisite to remove the definitions and get them from
<linux/hugetlb.h>.

This patch (of 2):

This removes the power specific stubs created by commit aad71e3928be
("powerpc/mm: Fix build break with RADIX=y & HUGETLBFS=n") used when
!CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE.  Instead, it addresses the build break by getting
the definitions from <linux/hugetlb.h>.  This allows the macros in
<linux/hugetlb.h> to be replaced with static inlines.
