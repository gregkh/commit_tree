Input: goodix - add upside-down quirk for Teclast X89 tablet

The touchscreen on the Teclast X89 is mounted upside down in relation to
the display orientation (the touchscreen itself is mounted upright, but the
display is mounted upside-down). Add a quirk for this so that we send
coordinates which match the display orientation.
