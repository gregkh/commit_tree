drm/i915/execlists: Assert tasklet is locked for process_csb()

We rely on only the tasklet being allowed to call into process_csb(), so
assert that is locked when we do. As the tasklet uses a simple bitlock,
there is no strong lockdep checking so we must make do with a plain
assertion that the tasklet is running and assume that we are the
tasklet!

v2: Fixup intel_gt_sanitize() to prepare each engine for the reset so
that the locks are marked as held during the reset
v3: Check for existent function pointers for very early sanitisation.
