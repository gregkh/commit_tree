platform/x86: GPD pocket fan: Use default values when wrong modparams are given

Use our default values when wrong module-parameters are given, instead of
refusing to load. Refusing to load leaves the fan at the BIOS default
setting, which is "Off". The CPU's thermal throttling should protect the
system from damage, but not-loading is really not the best fallback in this
case.

This commit fixes this by re-setting module-parameter values to their
defaults if they are out of range, instead of failing the probe with
-EINVAL.
