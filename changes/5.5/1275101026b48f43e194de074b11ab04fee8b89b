NFS based on file size issue sync copy or fallback to generic copy offload

For small file sizes, it make sense to issue a synchronous copy (and
save an RPC callback operation). Also, for the inter copy offload,
copy len must be larger than the cost of doing a mount between the
destination and source server (14RPCs are sent during 4.x mount).
