drm/i915/gem: Limit the blitter sizes to ensure low preemption latency

Currently we insert a arbitration point every 128MiB during a blitter
copy. At 8GiB/s, this is around 30ms. This is a little on the large side
if we need to inject a high priority work, so reduced it down to 8MiB or
roughly 1ms.

v2: Don't forget both fill/copy.
