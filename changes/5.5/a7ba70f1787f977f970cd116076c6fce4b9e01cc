dma-mapping: treat dev->bus_dma_mask as a DMA limit

Using a mask to represent bus DMA constraints has a set of limitations.
The biggest one being it can only hold a power of two (minus one). The
DMA mapping code is already aware of this and treats dev->bus_dma_mask
as a limit. This quirk is already used by some architectures although
still rare.

With the introduction of the Raspberry Pi 4 we've found a new contender
for the use of bus DMA limits, as its PCIe bus can only address the
lower 3GB of memory (of a total of 4GB). This is impossible to represent
with a mask. To make things worse the device-tree code rounds non power
of two bus DMA limits to the next power of two, which is unacceptable in
this case.

In the light of this, rename dev->bus_dma_mask to dev->bus_dma_limit all
over the tree and treat it as such. Note that dev->bus_dma_limit should
contain the higher accessible DMA address.
