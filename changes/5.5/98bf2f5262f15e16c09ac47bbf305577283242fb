drm/amd/display: Separate hardware initialization from creation

[Why]
Separating the hardware initialization from the creation of the
dc structures gives greater flexibility to the dm to override
options for debugging.

[How]
Move the hardware initialization call to a new function,
dc_hardware_init. No functional change is intended.
