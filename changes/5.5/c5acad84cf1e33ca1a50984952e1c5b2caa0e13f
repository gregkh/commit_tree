mm: Add write-protect and clean utilities for address space ranges

Add two utilities to 1) write-protect and 2) clean all ptes pointing into
a range of an address space.
The utilities are intended to aid in tracking dirty pages (either
driver-allocated system memory or pci device memory).
The write-protect utility should be used in conjunction with
page_mkwrite() and pfn_mkwrite() to trigger write page-faults on page
accesses. Typically one would want to use this on sparse accesses into
large memory regions. The clean utility should be used to utilize
hardware dirtying functionality and avoid the overhead of page-faults,
typically on large accesses into small memory regions.
