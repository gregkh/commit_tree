KVM: vgic-v4: Track the number of VLPIs per vcpu

In order to find out whether a vcpu is likely to be the target of
VLPIs (and to further optimize the way we deal with those), let's
track the number of VLPIs a vcpu can receive.

This gets implemented with an atomic variable that gets incremented
or decremented on map, unmap and move of a VLPI.
