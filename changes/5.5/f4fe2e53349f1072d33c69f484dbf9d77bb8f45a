ath10k: Revert "ath10k: add cleanup in ath10k_sta_state()"

This reverts commit 334f5b61a6f29834e881923b98d1e27e5ce9620d.

This caused ath10k_snoc on Qualcomm MSM8998, SDM845 and QCS404 platforms to
trigger an assert in the firmware:

err_qdi.c:456:EF:wlan_process:1:cmnos_thread.c:3900:Asserted in wlan_vdev.c:_wlan_vdev_up:3219

Revert the offending commit for now.
