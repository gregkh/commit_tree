soc: aspeed: Fix snoop_file_poll()'s return type

snoop_file_poll() is defined as returning 'unsigned int' but the
.poll method is declared as returning '__poll_t', a bitwise type.

Fix this by using the proper return type and using the EPOLL
constants instead of the POLL ones, as required for __poll_t.
