habanalabs: remove unnecessary checks

Now that the VA block free list is not updated on context close in order
to optimize this flow, no need in the sanity checks of the list contents
as these will fail for sure.
In addition, remove the "context closing with VA in use" print during hard
reset as this situation is a side effect of the failure that caused the
hard reset.
