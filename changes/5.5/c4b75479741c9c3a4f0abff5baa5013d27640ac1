perf/core: Make the mlock accounting simple again

Commit:

  d44248a41337 ("perf/core: Rework memory accounting in perf_mmap()")

does a lot of things to the mlock accounting arithmetics, while the only
thing that actually needed to happen is subtracting the part that is
charged to the mm from the part that is charged to the user, so that the
former isn't charged twice.
