usb: host: xhci-tegra: Add Tegra194 XHCI support

This commit adds Tegra194 XUSB host mode controller support. This is
very similar to the existing Tegra124/Tegra210/Tegra186 XHCI, except
  1. the number of ports and PHYs differs
  2. the IPFS wrapper being removed
  3. mailbox registers address changes
