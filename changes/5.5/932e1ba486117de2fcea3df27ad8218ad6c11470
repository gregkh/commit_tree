ACPI: button: Add DMI quirk for Medion Akoya E2215T

The Medion Akoya E2215T's ACPI _LID implementation is quite broken:

 1. For notifications it uses an ActiveLow Edge GpioInt, rather then
    an ActiveBoth one, meaning that the device is only notified when the
    lid is closed, not when it is opened.

2. Matching with this its _LID method simply always returns 0 (closed)

  In order for the Linux LID code to work properly with this implementation,
  the lid_init_state selection needs to be set to ACPI_BUTTON_LID_INIT_OPEN.

This commit adds a DMI quirk for this.
