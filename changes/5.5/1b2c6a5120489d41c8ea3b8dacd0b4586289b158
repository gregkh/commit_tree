crypto: x86/poly1305 - depend on generic library not generic shash

Remove the dependency on the generic Poly1305 driver. Instead, depend
on the generic library so that we only reuse code without pulling in
the generic skcipher implementation as well.

While at it, remove the logic that prefers the non-SIMD path for short
inputs - this is no longer necessary after recent FPU handling changes
on x86.

Since this removes the last remaining user of the routines exported
by the generic shash driver, unexport them and make them static.
