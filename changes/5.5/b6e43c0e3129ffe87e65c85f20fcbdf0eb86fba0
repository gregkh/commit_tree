arm64: remove __exception annotations

Since commit 732674980139 ("arm64: unwind: reference pt_regs via embedded
stack frame") arm64 has not used the __exception annotation to dump
the pt_regs during stack tracing. in_exception_text() has no callers.

This annotation is only used to blacklist kprobes, it means the same as
__kprobes.

Section annotations like this require the functions to be grouped
together between the start/end markers, and placed according to
the linker script. For kprobes we also have NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() which
logs the symbol address in a section that kprobes parses and
blacklists at boot.

Using NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() instead lets kprobes publish the list of
blacklisted symbols, and saves us from having an arm64 specific
spelling of __kprobes.

do_debug_exception() already has a NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() annotation.
