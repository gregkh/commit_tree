MAINTAINERS: Update Allwinner DRM drivers entry

The DRM drivers are more than about the A10 now, so let's make the entry
name a bit more generic.

Also, Chen-Yu has been a de-facto maintainer for the DRM driver for a
while, is a maintainer of the Allwinner platform for an even longer time,
and has drm-misc commit access. Let's make it formal and add him as a
maintainer.
