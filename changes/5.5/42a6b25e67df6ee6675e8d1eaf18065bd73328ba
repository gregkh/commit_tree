PM / devfreq: Don't fail devfreq_dev_release if not in list

Right now devfreq_dev_release will print a warning and abort the rest of
the cleanup if the devfreq instance is not part of the global
devfreq_list. But this is a valid scenario, for example it can happen if
the governor can't be found or on any other init error that happens
after device_register.

Initialize devfreq->node to an empty list head in devfreq_add_device so
that list_del becomes a safe noop inside devfreq_dev_release and we can
continue the rest of the cleanup.
