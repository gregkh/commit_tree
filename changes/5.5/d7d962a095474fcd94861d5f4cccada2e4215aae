libbpf: Use implicit XSKMAP lookup from AF_XDP XDP program

In commit 43e74c0267a3 ("bpf_xdp_redirect_map: Perform map lookup in
eBPF helper") the bpf_redirect_map() helper learned to do map lookup,
which means that the explicit lookup in the XDP program for AF_XDP is
not needed for post-5.3 kernels.

This commit adds the implicit map lookup with default action, which
improves the performance for the "rx_drop" [1] scenario with ~4%.

For pre-5.3 kernels, the bpf_redirect_map() returns XDP_ABORTED, and a
fallback path for backward compatibility is entered, where explicit
lookup is still performed. This means a slight regression for older
kernels (an additional bpf_redirect_map() call), but I consider that a
fair punishment for users not upgrading their kernels. ;-)
