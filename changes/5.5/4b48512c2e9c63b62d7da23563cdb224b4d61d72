stacktrace: Get rid of unneeded '!!' pattern

My commit b0c51f158455 ("stacktrace: Don't skip first entry on
noncurrent tasks") adds one or zero to skipnr by "!!(current == tsk)".

But the C99 standard says:

  The == (equal to) and != (not equal to) operators are
  ...
  Each of the operators yields 1 if the specified relation is true and 0
  if it is false.

So there is no need to prepend the above expression by "!!" -- remove it.
