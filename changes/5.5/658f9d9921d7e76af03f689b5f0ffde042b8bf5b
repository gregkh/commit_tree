media: hantro: Fix motion vectors usage condition

The setting of the motion vectors usage and the setting of motion
vectors address are currently done under different conditions.

When decoding pre-recorded videos, this results of leaving the motion
vectors address unset, resulting in faulty memory accesses. Fix it
by using the same condition everywhere, which matches the profiles
that support motion vectors.
