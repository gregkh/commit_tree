spi: gpio: prevent memory leak in spi_gpio_probe

In spi_gpio_probe an SPI master is allocated via spi_alloc_master, but
this controller should be released if devm_add_action_or_reset fails,
otherwise memory leaks. In order to avoid leak spi_contriller_put must
be called in case of failure for devm_add_action_or_reset.
