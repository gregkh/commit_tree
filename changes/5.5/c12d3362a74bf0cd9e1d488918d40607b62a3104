int128: move __uint128_t compiler test to Kconfig

In order to use 128-bit integer arithmetic in C code, the architecture
needs to have declared support for it by setting ARCH_SUPPORTS_INT128,
and it requires a version of the toolchain that supports this at build
time. This is why all existing tests for ARCH_SUPPORTS_INT128 also test
whether __SIZEOF_INT128__ is defined, since this is only the case for
compilers that can support 128-bit integers.

Let's fold this additional test into the Kconfig declaration of
ARCH_SUPPORTS_INT128 so that we can also use the symbol in Makefiles,
e.g., to decide whether a certain object needs to be included in the
first place.
