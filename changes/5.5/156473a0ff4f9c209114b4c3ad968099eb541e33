ftrace: Add another example of register_ftrace_direct() use case

Add another module sample that registers a direct trampoline to a function
via register_ftrace_direct(). Having another module that does this allows to
test the use case of multiple direct callers registered, as more than one
direct caller goes into another path, and is needed to perform proper
testing of the register_ftrace_direct() call.
