ASoC: soc-core: merge soc_free_pcm_runtime() and soc_rtd_free()

"rtd"      is handled by soc_xxx_pcm_runtime(), and
"rtd->dev" is handled by soc_rtd_xxx().

There is no reason to separate these, and it makes code complex.
We can free these in the same time.

Here soc_rtd_free() (A) which frees rtd->dev is called from
soc_remove_link_dais() many times (1).
Then, it is using dev_registered flags to avoid multi kfree() (2).
This is no longer needed if we can merge these functions.

	static void soc_remove_link_dais(...)
	{
		...
(1)		for_each_comp_order(order) {
(1)			for_each_card_rtds(card, rtd) {

(A)				soc_rtd_free(rtd);
				...
			}
		}
	}

(A)	static void soc_rtd_free(...)
	{
(2)		if (rtd->dev_registered) {
			/* we don't need to call kfree() for rtd->dev */
			device_unregister(rtd->dev);
(2)			rtd->dev_registered = 0;
		}
	}

This patch merges soc_rtd_free() into soc_free_pcm_runtime().
