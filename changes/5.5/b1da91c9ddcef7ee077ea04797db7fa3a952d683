drm/i915/tgl: Swap engines for no rps (gpu reclocking)

If we disable rps, it appears the Tigerlake is stable enough to run
multiple engines simultaneously in CI. As disabling rps should only
cause the execution to be slow, whereas many features depend on the
different engines, we would prefer to have the engines enabled while the
machine hangs are being debugged.
