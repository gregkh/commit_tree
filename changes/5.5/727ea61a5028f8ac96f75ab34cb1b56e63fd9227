Bluetooth: missed cpu_to_le16 conversion in hci_init4_req

It looks like in hci_init4_req() the request is being
initialised from cpu-endian data but the packet is specified
to be little-endian. This causes an warning from sparse due
to __le16 to u16 conversion.

Fix this by using cpu_to_le16() on the two fields in the packet.
