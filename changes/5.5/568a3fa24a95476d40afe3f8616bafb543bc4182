net: mvneta: introduce page pool API for sw buffer manager

Use the page_pool api for allocations and DMA handling instead of
__dev_alloc_page()/dma_map_page() and free_page()/dma_unmap_page().
Pages are unmapped using page_pool_release_page before packets
go into the network stack.

The page_pool API offers buffer recycling capabilities for XDP but
allocates one page per packet, unless the driver splits and manages
the allocated page.
This is a preliminary patch to add XDP support to mvneta driver
