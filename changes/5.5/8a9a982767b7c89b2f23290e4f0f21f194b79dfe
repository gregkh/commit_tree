drm/i915: use a separate context for gpu relocs

The CS pre-parser can pre-fetch commands across memory sync points and
starting from gen12 it is able to pre-fetch across BB_START and BB_END
boundaries as well, so when we emit gpu relocs the pre-parser might
fetch the target location of the reloc before the memory write lands.

The parser can't pre-fetch across the ctx switch, so we use a separate
context to guarantee that the memory is synchronized before the parser
can get to it.

Note that there is no risk of the CS doing a lite restore from the reloc
context to the user context, even if the two have the same hw_id,
because since gen11 the CS also checks the LRCA when deciding if it can
lite-restore.

v2: limit new context to gen12+, release in eb_destroy, add a comment
    in emit_fini_breadcrumb (Chris).
