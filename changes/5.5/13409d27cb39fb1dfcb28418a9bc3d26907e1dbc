ASoC: wm8904: configure sysclk/FLL automatically

This adds a new mode WM8904_CLK_AUTO which automatically enables the FLL
if a frequency different than the MCLK is set.

These additions make the codec work with the simple-card driver in
general and especially in systems where the MCLK doesn't match the
required clock.
