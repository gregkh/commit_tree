drivers: Fix boot problem on SuperH

SuperH images crash too eearly to display any console output. Bisect
points to commit 507fd01d5333 ("drivers: move the early platform device
support to arch/sh"). An analysis of that patch suggests that
early_platform_cleanup() is now called at the wrong time. Restoring its
call point fixes the problem.
