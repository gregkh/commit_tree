scsi: lpfc: Fix unexpected error messages during RSCN handling

During heavy RCN activity and log_verbose = 0 we see these messages:

  2754 PRLI failure DID:521245 Status:x9/xb2c00, data: x0
  0231 RSCN timeout Data: x0 x3
  0230 Unexpected timeout, hba link state x5

This is due to delayed RSCN activity.

Correct by avoiding the timeout thus the messages by restarting the
discovery timeout whenever an rscn is received.

Filter PRLI responses such that severity depends on whether expected for
the configuration or not. For example, PRLI errors on a fabric will be
informational (they are expected), but Point-to-Point errors are not
necessarily expected so they are raised to an error level.
