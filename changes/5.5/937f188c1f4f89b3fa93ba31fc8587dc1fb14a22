bnxt_en: Fix the logic that creates the health reporters.

Fix the logic to properly check the fw capabilities and create the
devlink health reporters only when needed.  The current code creates
the reporters unconditionally as long as bp->fw_health is valid, and
that's not correct.

Call bnxt_dl_fw_reporters_create() directly from the init and reset
code path instead of from bnxt_dl_register().  This allows the
reporters to be adjusted when capabilities change.  The same
applies to bnxt_dl_fw_reporters_destroy().
