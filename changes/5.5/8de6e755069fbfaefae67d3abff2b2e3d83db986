ASoC: rt1011: Read and apply r0 and temperature device property

Typically, the r0 (calibration data) and temperature were measured in the factory.
This information is written into the non-volatile area
where keeps data whether factory reset or OS update.
In Chromium OS case, the coreboot will read the info from VPD and create
the device property for each rt1011.
