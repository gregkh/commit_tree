drm/i915/selftests: Start kthreads before stopping

An interesting observation made with our parallel selftests was that on
our small/single cpu systems we would call kthread_stop() before the
kthreads were spawned. If this happens, the kthread is never run at all;
completely bypassing the test.

A simple yield() from the parent will ensure that all children have the
opportunity to start before we reap them.
