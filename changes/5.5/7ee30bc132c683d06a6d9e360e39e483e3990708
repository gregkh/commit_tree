KVM: x86: deliver KVM IOAPIC scan request to target vCPUs

In IOAPIC fixed delivery mode instead of flushing the scan
requests to all vCPUs, we should only send the requests to
vCPUs specified within the destination field.

This patch introduces kvm_get_dest_vcpus_mask() API which
retrieves an array of target vCPUs by using
kvm_apic_map_get_dest_lapic() and then based on the
vcpus_idx, it sets the bit in a bitmap. However, if the above
fails kvm_get_dest_vcpus_mask() finds the target vCPUs by
traversing all available vCPUs. Followed by setting the
bits in the bitmap.

If we had different vCPUs in the previous request for the
same redirection table entry then bits corresponding to
these vCPUs are also set. This to done to keep
ioapic_handled_vectors synchronized.

This bitmap is then eventually passed on to
kvm_make_vcpus_request_mask() to generate a masked request
only for the target vCPUs.

This would enable us to reduce the latency overhead on isolated
vCPUs caused by the IPI to process due to KVM_REQ_IOAPIC_SCAN.
