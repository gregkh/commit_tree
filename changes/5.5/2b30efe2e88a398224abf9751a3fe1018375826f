tty: serial: lpuart: Remove unnecessary code from set_mctrl

Currently flow control is not working due to lpuart32_set_mctrl that is
clearing TXCTSE bit in all cases. This bit gets earlier setup by
lpuart32_set_termios.

As I read in Documentation set_mctrl is also not meant for hardware
flow control rather than gpio setting and clearing a RTS signal.
Therefore I guess it is safe to remove the whole code in
lpuart32_set_mctrl.

This was tested with console on a i.MX8QXP SoC.
