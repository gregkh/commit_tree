PCI/PM: Avoid exporting __pci_complete_power_transition()

Notice that radeon_set_suspend(), which is the only caller of
__pci_complete_power_transition() outside of pci.c, really only
cares about the pci_platform_power_transition() invoked by it,
so export the latter instead of it, update the radeon driver to
call pci_platform_power_transition() directly and make
__pci_complete_power_transition() static.

Code rearrangement, no intentional functional impact.
