media: v4l2-core: Implement v4l2_ctrl_new_std_compound

Currently compound controls do not have a simple way of initializing its
values. This results in ofuscated code with type_ops init.

This patch introduces a new field on the control with the default value
for the compound control that can be set with the brand new
v4l2_ctrl_new_std_compound function
