octeontx2-af: Support configurable NDC cache way_mask

Each of the NIX/NPA LFs can choose which ways of their respective
NDC caches should be used to cache their contexts. This enables
flexible configurations like disabling caching for a LF, limiting
it's context to a certain set of ways etc etc. Separate way_mask
for NIX-TX and NIX-RX is not supported.
