cpufreq: merge arm_big_little and vexpress-spc

arm_big_little cpufreq driver was designed as a generic big little
driver that could be used by any platform and make use of bL switcher.
Over years alternate solutions have been designed and merged to deal
with bL/HMP systems like EAS.

Also since no other driver made use of generic arm_big_little cpufreq
driver except Vexpress SPC, we can merge them together as vexpress-spc
driver used only on Vexpress TC2(CA15_CA7) platform.
