net: ena: fix napi handler misbehavior when the napi budget is zero

In netpoll the napi handler could be called with budget equal to zero.
Current ENA napi handler doesn't take that into consideration.

The napi handler handles Rx packets in a do-while loop.
Currently, the budget check happens only after decrementing the
budget, therefore the napi handler, in rare cases, could run over
MAX_INT packets.

In addition to that, this moves all budget related variables to int
calculation and stop mixing u32 to avoid ambiguity
