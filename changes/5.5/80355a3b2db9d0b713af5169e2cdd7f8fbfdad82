EDAC/amd64: Gather hardware information early

Split out gathering hardware information from init_one_instance()
into a separate function hw_info_get(). This is necessary so that
the information can be cached earlier and used to check if memory is
populated and if ECC is enabled on a node.

Also, define a function hw_info_put() to back out changes made in
hw_info_get().

Check for an allocated PCI device (Function 0 for Family 17h or Function
1 for pre-Family 17h) before freeing, since hw_info_put() may be called
before PCI siblings are reserved.

Drop the family check when freeing pvt->umc. This will be NULL on
pre-Family 17h systems. However, kfree() is safe and will check for a
NULL pointer before freeing.
