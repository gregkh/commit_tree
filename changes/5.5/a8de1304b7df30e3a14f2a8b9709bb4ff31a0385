libfdt: define INT32_MAX and UINT32_MAX in libfdt_env.h

The DTC v1.5.1 added references to (U)INT32_MAX.

This is no problem for user-space programs since <stdint.h> defines
(U)INT32_MAX along with (u)int32_t.

For the kernel space, libfdt_env.h needs to be adjusted before we
pull in the changes.

In the kernel, we usually use s/u32 instead of (u)int32_t for the
fixed-width types.

Accordingly, we already have S/U32_MAX for their max values.
So, we should not add (U)INT32_MAX to <linux/limits.h> any more.

Instead, add them to the in-kernel libfdt_env.h to compile the
latest libfdt.
