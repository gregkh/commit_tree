xfs: reuse best extent tracking logic for bnobt scan

The near mode bnobt scan searches left and right in the bnobt
looking for the closest free extent to the allocation hint that
satisfies minlen. Once such an extent is found, the left/right
search terminates, we search one more time in the opposite direction
and finish the allocation with the best overall extent.

The left/right and find best searches are currently controlled via a
combination of cursor state and local variables. Clean up this code
and prepare for further improvements to the near mode fallback
algorithm by reusing the allocation cursor best extent tracking
mechanism. Update the tracking logic to deactivate bnobt cursors
when out of allocation range and replace open-coded extent checks to
calls to the common helper. In doing so, rename some misnamed local
variables in the top-level near mode allocation function.
