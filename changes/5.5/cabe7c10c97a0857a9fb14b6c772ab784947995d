scsi: hisi_sas: Delete the debugfs folder of hisi_sas when the probe fails

Although if the debugfs initialization fails, we will delete the debugfs
folder of hisi_sas, but we did not consider the scenario where debugfs was
successfully initialized, but the probe failed for other reasons. We found
out that hisi_sas folder is still remain after the probe failed.

When probe fail, we should delete debugfs folder to avoid the above issue.
