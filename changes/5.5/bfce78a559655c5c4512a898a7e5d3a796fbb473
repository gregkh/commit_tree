ASoC: soc-core: tidyup soc_init_dai_link()

soc_init_dai_link() is needed to be called before soc_bind_dai_link().

	int snd_soc_instantiate_card()
	{
		for_each_card_prelinks(...) {
(1)			ret = soc_init_dai_link(...);
			...
		}
		...
		for_each_card_prelinks(...) {
(2)			ret = soc_bind_dai_link(...);
			...
		}
		...
		for_each_card_links(...) {
			...
(A)			ret = soc_init_dai_link(...);
			...
(B)			ret = soc_bind_dai_link(...);
		}
		...

(1) is for (2), and (A) is for (B)
(1) and (2) are for card prelink   dai_link.
(A) and (B) are for topology added dai_link.

soc_init_dai_link() is sanity check for dai_link, not initializing today.
Therefore, it is confusable naming. We can rename it as sanity_check.

And this check is for soc_bind_dai_link().
It can be more simple code if we can call it from soc_bind_dai_link().

This patch renames it to soc_dai_link_sanity_check(), and
call it from soc_bind_dai_link().
