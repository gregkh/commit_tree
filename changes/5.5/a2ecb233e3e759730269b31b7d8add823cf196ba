mips: Kconfig: Add ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE

FORTIFY_SOURCE detects various overflows at compile and run time.
(6974f0c4555e ("include/linux/string.h:
add the option of fortified string.h functions)

ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE means that the architecture can be built and
run with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.

Since mips can be built and run with that flag,
select ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE as default.
