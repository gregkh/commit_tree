arm64: tegra: Fix compatible string for EQOS on Tegra194

The EQOS Ethernet controller found on Tegra194 is compatible with its
predecessor or Tegra186. However, it is an established practice to add
a compatible string for the most recent generation of the SoC as well,
just in case some incompatibilities or bugs are later discovered.
