jbd2: Factor out common parts of stopping and restarting a handle

jbd2__journal_restart() has quite some code that is common with
jbd2_journal_stop(). Factor this functionality into stop_this_handle()
helper and use it from both functions. Note that this also drops
t_handle_lock protection from jbd2__journal_restart() as
jbd2_journal_stop() does the same thing without it.
