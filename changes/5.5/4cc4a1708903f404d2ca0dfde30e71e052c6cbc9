batman-adv: Fix DAT candidate selection on little endian systems

The distributed arp table is using a DHT to store and retrieve MAC address
information for an IP address. This is done using unicast messages to
selected peers. The potential peers are looked up using the IP address and
the VID.

While the IP address is always stored in big endian byte order, this is not
the case of the VID. It can (depending on the host system) either be big
endian or little endian. The host must therefore always convert it to big
endian to ensure that all devices calculate the same peers for the same
lookup data.
