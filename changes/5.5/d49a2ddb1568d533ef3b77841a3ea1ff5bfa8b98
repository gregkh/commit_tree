btrfs: block-group: Reuse the item key from caller of read_one_block_group()

For read_one_block_group(), its only caller has already got the item key
to search next block group item.

So we can use that key directly without doing our own convertion on
stack.

Also, since that key used in btrfs_read_block_groups() is vital for
block group item search, add 'const' keyword for that parameter to
prevent read_one_block_group() to modify it.
