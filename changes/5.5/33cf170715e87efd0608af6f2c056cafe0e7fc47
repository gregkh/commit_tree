mm: ksm: Export ksm_madvise()

On PEF-enabled POWER platforms that support running of secure guests,
secure pages of the guest are represented by device private pages
in the host. Such pages needn't participate in KSM merging. This is
achieved by using ksm_madvise() call which need to be exported
since KVM PPC can be a kernel module.
