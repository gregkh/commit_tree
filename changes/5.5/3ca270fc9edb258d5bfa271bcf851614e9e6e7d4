perf/core: Provide a kernel-internal interface to recalibrate event period

Currently, perf_event_period() is used by user tools via ioctl. Based on
naming convention, exporting perf_event_period() for kernel users (such
as KVM) who may recalibrate the event period for their assigned counter
according to their requirements.

The perf_event_period() is an external accessor, just like the
perf_event_{en,dis}able() and should thus use perf_event_ctx_lock().
