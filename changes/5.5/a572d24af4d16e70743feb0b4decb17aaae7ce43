scsi: target: iscsi: CHAP: add support for SHA1, SHA256 and SHA3-256

This patch modifies the chap_server_compute_hash() function to make it
agnostic to the choice of hash algorithm that is used.  It also adds
support to three new hash algorithms: SHA1, SHA256 and SHA3-256.

The chap_got_response() function has been removed because the digest type
validity is already checked by chap_server_open()
