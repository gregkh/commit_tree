bpf: Fix bpf jit kallsym access

Jiri reported crash when JIT is on, but net.core.bpf_jit_kallsyms is off.
bpf_prog_kallsyms_find() was skipping addr->bpf_prog resolution
logic in oops and stack traces. That's incorrect.
It should only skip addr->name resolution for 'cat /proc/kallsyms'.
That's what bpf_jit_kallsyms and bpf_jit_harden protect.
