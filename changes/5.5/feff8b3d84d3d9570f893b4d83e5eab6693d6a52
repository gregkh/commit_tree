scsi: lpfc: Fix SLI3 hba in loop mode not discovering devices

When operating in private loop mode, PLOGI exchanges are racing and the
driver tries to abort it's PLOGI. But the PLOGI abort ends up terminating
the login with the other end causing the other end to abort its PLOGI as
well. Discovery never fully completes.

Fix by disabling the PLOGI abort when private loop and letting the state
machine play out.
