fsnotify: move declaration of fsnotify_mark_connector_cachep to fsnotify.h

Move fsnotify_mark_connector_cachep to fsnotify.h to properly
share it with the user in mark.c and avoid the following warning
from sparse:

fs/notify/mark.c:82:19: warning: symbol 'fsnotify_mark_connector_cachep' was not declared. Should it be static?
