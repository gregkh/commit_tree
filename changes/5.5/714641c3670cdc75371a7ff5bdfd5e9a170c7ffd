ftrace: Separate out the copying of a ftrace_hash from __ftrace_hash_move()

Most of the functionality of __ftrace_hash_move() can be reused, but not all
of it. That is, __ftrace_hash_move() is used to simply make a new hash from
an existing one, using the same size as the original. Creating a dup_hash(),
where we can specify a new size will be useful when we want to create a hash
with a default size, or simply copy the old one.
