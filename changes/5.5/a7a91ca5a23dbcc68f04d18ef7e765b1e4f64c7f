staging: wfx: add infrastructure for new driver

Instantiate build infrastructure WFx driver. This driver provides support
for Wifi chipset Silicon Labs WF200 and further:

   https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/wf200-datasheet.pdf

This chip support SPI and SDIO bus.

SDIO interface has two particularities:
    1. Some parameters may be useful for end user (I will talk about
       gpio_wakeup later).
    2. The SDIO VID and PID of WF200 are 0000:0001 which are too much
       generic to rely on.

So, current code checks VID/PID and looks for a node in DT (since WF200
targets embedded platforms, I don't think it is a problem to rely on
DT). DT can also be used to define to parameters for driver. Currently,
if no node is found, a warning is emitted, but it could be changed in
error.
