iio: imu: inv_mpu6050: fix temperature reporting using bad unit

Temperature should be reported in milli-degrees, not degrees. Fix
scale and offset values to use the correct unit.

This is a fix for an issue that has been present for a long time.
The fixes tag reflects the point at which the code last changed in a
fashion that would make this fix patch no longer apply.  Backports
will be necessary to fix those elements that predate that patch.
