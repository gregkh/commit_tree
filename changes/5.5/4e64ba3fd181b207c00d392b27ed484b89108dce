ASoC: Intel: common: work-around incorrect ACPI HID for CML boards

On CML boards with the RT5682 headset codec and RT1011 speaker
amplifier, the platform firmware exposes three ACPI HIDs
(10EC5682, 10EC1011 and MX98357A). The last HID is a mistake in
DSDT tables, which causes the wrong machine driver to be loaded.

This patch changes the key used to identify boards and changes the
order of entries in the table to load the correct machine driver.
The order does matter and should not be modified to work-around this
firmware issue.
