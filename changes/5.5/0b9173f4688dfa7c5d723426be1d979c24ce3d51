netfilter: nf_queue: enqueue skbs with NULL dst

Bridge packets that are forwarded have skb->dst == NULL and get
dropped by the check introduced by
b60a77386b1d4868f72f6353d35dabe5fbe981f2 (net: make skb_dst_force
return true when dst is refcounted).

To fix this we check skb_dst() before skb_dst_force(), so we don't
drop skb packet with dst == NULL. This holds also for skb at the
PRE_ROUTING hook so we remove the second check.

Fixes: b60a77386b1d ("net: make skb_dst_force return true when dst is refcounted")
