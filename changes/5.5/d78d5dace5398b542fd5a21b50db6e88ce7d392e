powerpc/book3s64/hash: Use secondary hash for bolted mapping if the primary is full

With bolted hash page table entry, kernel currently only use primary hash group
when inserting the hash page table entry. In the rare case where kernel find all the
8 primary hash slot occupied by bolted entries, this can result in hash page
table insert failure for bolted entries. Avoid this by using the secondary hash
group.

This is different from what kernel does for the non-bolted mapping. With
non-bolted entries kernel will try secondary before removing an existing entry
from hash page table group. With bolted prefer primary hash group and hence
try to insert the page table entry by removing a slot from primary before trying
the secondary hash group.
