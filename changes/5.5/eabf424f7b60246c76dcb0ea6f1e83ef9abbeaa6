ASoC: rt5677: Mark reg RT5677_PWR_ANLG2 as volatile

The codec dies when RT5677_PWR_ANLG2(MX-64h) is set to 0xACE1
while it's streaming audio over SPI. The DSP firmware turns
on PLL2 (MX-64 bit 8) when SPI streaming starts.  However regmap
does not believe that register can change by itself. When
BST1 (bit 15) is turned on with regmap_update_bits(), it doesn't
read the register first before write, so PLL2 power bit is
cleared by accident.

Marking MX-64h as volatile in regmap solved the issue.
