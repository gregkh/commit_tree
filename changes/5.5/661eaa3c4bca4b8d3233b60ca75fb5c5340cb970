media: ti-vpe: Set MAX height supported to 2048 pixels

VPE's max height supported MAX_H is set to 1184 which is the
padded height from VC1 decoder output.

In case of 90, 270 degree rotated video processing, input to
VPE will be 1080x1920, 720x1280 etc and MAX_H needs to be set
correct value. Setting MAX_H to 2048 as worst case height.
