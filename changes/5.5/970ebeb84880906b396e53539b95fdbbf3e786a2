vfio-ccw: Trace the FSM jumptable

It would be nice if we could track the sequence of events within
vfio-ccw, based on the state of the device/FSM and our calling
sequence within it.  So let's add a simple trace here so we can
watch the states change as things go, and allow it to be folded
into the rest of the other cio traces.
